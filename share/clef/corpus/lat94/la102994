 RELIGIOUS REVIVAL: As Election Day approaches, some politicians will enter a 
lion's den to solicit votes. Three Simi Valley council candidates faced tough 
questioning Friday at a forum sponsored by a Christian radio network (B5) . . . 
. A church leader wanted to know why they didn't participate in a voters' 
guide.One candidate said the answers were lost in the mail. Another never got 
the questionnaire. A third objected to some questions as irrelevant -- and was 
scolded by his host George Otis: "If you want to be elected, this is a good 
voting block."

 LAND GRAB? Possession is nine-tenths of the law, as the saying goes. Following 
that maxim, Ventura officials are considering annexing Weldon Canyon so they 
can determine if a garbage dump is built there (B1). . . . City leaders oppose 
locating a landfill in the canyon 2 1/2 miles north of Ventura's city limit. 
They only have to look to Bailard Landfill to see the pitfalls of a dump 
outside city control. Oxnard officials want Bailard to close, but there's no 
place else for the trash to go.

 HERE COMES . . .: To her colleagues, she's known as Toy -- a childhood 
nickname that stuck. Now they can call her "Your Honor." Colleen Toy White was 
appointed by the governor as a Superior Court judge on Friday (B1).

1,500 STUDENTS LEAVE SCHOOLS OVER PROP. 187; PROTEST: YOUTHS WALK OUT OF 
CLASSES AT 11 CAMPUSES IN OXNARD AND CAMARILLO; MARCH THROUGH OXNARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 About 1,500 Ventura County students walked out of classes Friday in a mass 
protest against Proposition 187, most joining a peaceful march through Oxnard 
that ended in scattered fistfights and brief confrontations with riot-ready 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 The walkout coincided with similar protests in the San Fernando Valley, where 
thousands of youths walked off campuses in the largest student demonstrations 
to date against the initiative. In one of those demonstrations, scores of 
police armed with shotguns faced down hundreds of students at the Van Nuys 
government center. 
</P>
<P>
 In what is thought to be the largest walkout in Ventura County history, 
students marched out of six high schools and five junior highs in Oxnard and 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoisting protest placards and chanting "No on 187," the protesters made their 
way to Plaza Park in downtown Oxnard, where they denounced the ballot measure 
aimed in part at banning illegal immigrants from public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Police estimated that more than 2,000 protesters jammed the park. School 
officials say about 1,200 students who walked off campuses in Oxnard and 
Camarillo starting at 8:30 a.m. joined that rally. In a separate protest in 
Santa Paula, 300 students marched from the local high school to City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're fighting for our parents, our loved ones, everybody," Oxnard College 
student Lorenzo Zwaal shouted to the Plaza Park crowd while he straddled a tree 
limb. "We need to stop the violence within ourselves, we need to stop killing 
our own. To do that we have to be educated." 
</P>
<P>
 But after protest organizers became indecisive about how to return students to 
their schools, the restless demonstrators broke through police lines about 
11:30 a.m. and marched to nearby Community Center Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, some marchers threw rocks at motorists and jumped on parked 
cars. And at the park, police said rival gang members clashed in a series of 
brawls. 
</P>
<P>
 With a column of helmeted police armed with batons at the ready, Ventura 
County sheriff's deputies on horseback waded through the crowd, breaking up 
fights and ordering students to disperse. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration ended around noon when students started boarding buses that 
took them back to their schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested three juveniles for fighting. A fourth person, Juan Antonio 
Reyes Ordaz, 20, of Oxnard, was taken into custody for resisting arrest. No one 
was seriously hurt, and all four of those arrested were held at the Oxnard 
police station and released. 
</P>
<P>
 A force of 93 officers from the Oxnard Police Department, the Sheriff's 
Department and the California Highway Patrol were called to keep the peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard police spokesman David Keith said he thought the fighting had little to 
do with the protest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was more of a gang thing than a Prop. 187 thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Police Chief Harold Hurtt blamed organizers of the demonstration for 
the violence that erupted at Community Center Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm extremely disappointed in the organizers, in the fact that they did not 
have a plan for dispersing this," Hurtt said while watching sheriff's deputies 
break up scuffles. "They should have had more leadership there. We didn't want 
to have a police intervention." 
</P>
<P>
 But the organizers and others countered that the police were to blame for the 
unruliness, saying officers intimidated the students and failed to help 
disperse the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "We asked them if they could give us a megaphone or a bullhorn to help us talk 
to the students, and they said no," said Oxnard College student Pedro Pantoja, 
a member of the college's Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan, which 
helped stage the walkout. "If we don't have support from the police to help us 
out, they shouldn't complain." 
</P>
<P>
 For more than two hours, the protest was peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
 Students started walking out of schools at about 8:30 a.m., waving signs and 
chanting slogans. Some waved Mexican flags. Others carried the American flag. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ocean View Junior High, about 70 students walked out. And at two other 
Oxnard junior highs -- Fremont and Frank intermediate schools -- another 200 
students joined the protest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to protest 187," said 13-year-old Jesus Hernandez of Frank 
Intermediate. "People are trying to take our rights away and that is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 At Oxnard High, about 100 students walked out of class about 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody should be denied education anywhere," said Gus Vasquez, 
17. "There's going to be a bunch of delinquents running around." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Juan Carlos Pelayo, a 16-year-old student at Frontier Continuation High 
School in Camarillo: "Imagine all these kids not being able to go to school. 
They'll all be gang members, man. It'll be mayhem." 
</P>
<P>
 The largest contingent came from Hueneme High School, which had more than 300 
marchers. And 200 students from Rio Mesa High School also joined the 
demonstration, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the marchers were mostly Latino, blacks and whites also took part. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not right, it's racist," said Oxnard High student Chris Davis, 16, one 
of a handful of white students who joined the march. "It's not about being 
Mexican." 
</P>
<P>
 District administrators said they consider all students who walked out truants 
and said they will face punishment ranging from detention to suspension. But 
some school officials showed enthusiasm for the students' actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's healthy," Oxnard Union High School District trustee Fred Judy said as he 
observed the rally at Plaza Park. "We need for our young people to understand 
the political system." 
</P>
<P>
 While many motorists honked in support of the students, some Oxnard 
shopkeepers across from Plaza Park said they resented the interruption to their 
daily businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like the fact that they shut off my street," said Lyle Althoff, a 
downtown insurance agent. "That hampers my business." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, with a spirit of activism rarely seen in their generation, the students 
milled around the Plaza Park pagoda, voicing the 20-year-old chants of Latino 
pride. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers talked about 187, about Pete Wilson and Latino unity, as they 
rallied the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you want?" Zwaal shouted. "Justice!" the students responded. 
</P>
<P>
 "When do you want it?" Zwaal said. "Now!" the crowd responded. 
</P>
<P>
 After students boarded buses, their worst fears were realized. Many had 
worried about what their punishment would be if they could be identified among 
those who walked out of school. 
</P>
<P>
 As a bus pulled into Rio Mesa High, students were greeted by school officials 
who told them that they had to show identification and give their names to get 
off the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many students said it was worth any punishment they will receive to get 
their point across. Said 17-year-old Martha Gonzales, "I just wish I could vote 
on this."

DAVE JOHNSON, 39; L.A.'S FIRST AIDS COORDINATOR, WRITER ON GAY ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave Johnson, who became the first AIDS coordinator for Los Angeles when Mayor 
Tom Bradley named him to implement the city's $2.5-million program in 1989, 
died Thursday of the complications of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Chris Brownlie Hospice near Downtown Los Angeles said 
Johnson was 39 when he died there Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson brought a wealth of experience in gay causes to the city post, where 
he was responsible for mobilizing the city's efforts to cope with the AIDS 
epidemic. He oversaw residential units, prevention programs and even financial 
aid for those too ill to support themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 He also wrote about the disease in mainstream publications such as The Times 
and in the alternative press, which published many of his articles and essays. 
At one time he had been a reporter and editorial writer for the old Los Angeles 
Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
 Before taking the city job, he had been a co-founder and first chairman of the 
United AIDS Coalition of Los Angeles County -- an umbrella group of 30 
organizations -- and executive director of Being Alive/People With AIDS 
Coalition. Before that he worked in the private sector as a project manager for 
credit, sales and advertising for May Department Stores in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He turned full time to the AIDS battle after his longtime companion died in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 During the early 1970s, Johnson was coordinator of the UCLA Gay Students' 
Union and coordinator of the Gay Community Services Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include his parents, Russell and Connie Johnson, and a brother and 
sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Services are pending.

WILBERT HARRISON; SINGER HAD HITS WITH 'KANSAS CITY,' 'LET'S WORK TOGETHER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wilbert Harrison, whose rollicking version of a blues tune that extolled those 
"crazy little women" who lived in Kansas City became an overnight success near 
the dawn of rock 'n' roll, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison, who battled poverty and fickle fans through the major part of his 
career, died Wednesday of a stroke in Spencer, N.C. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he had two big hits during a career that began when he was 16 -- 
"Kansas City" in 1959 and "Let's Work Together" a decade later -- Harrison was 
forced to work as a solo act throughout his life because he could never afford 
sidemen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kansas City" topped the pop charts for two weeks in May, 1959, and was by far 
Harrison's biggest hit. The song, a version of the blues tune "K.C. Loving," 
was also performed and recorded by the Beatles, James Brown and Ann-Margret. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's Work Together" was a plea for greater understanding among people, and 
its success led to a big-time but abbreviated tour with Creedence Clearwater. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison's guitar playing and singing began in his hometown of Charlotte, 
N.C., and by the early 1950s he was making a few unsuccessful records for the 
Rockin label. One was "This Woman of Mine," which attracted some attention and 
led to a recording contract with the DeLuxe and Savoy labels and later with 
Fury. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he continued to perform into the '90s, Harrison never matched his 
earlier successes.

DETERRING CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re: "We Need More Than 3 Strikes to Be Safe From Real Killers," Commentary, 
Oct. 20: 
</P>
<P>
 I agree that the three-strikes law does not address the problem of the 
majority of violent crimes in our society; however, neither does gun control. 
Gun control, like the three-strikes law, is merely a Band-Aid for the larger 
problem of the breakdown of our society and its values.Gun control may help 
eliminate some of the senseless, emotionally driven murders in our society, but 
clearly, if someone is intent on committing a crime of passion, he will not let 
gun control deter him; he will obtain a gun illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue we must address is why such crimes are happening in the first place. 
When we come up with that answer and begin to rebuild the damaged structure of 
our society, issues like gun control and the three-strikes law will become 
obsolete.

COVERAGE OF PROP. 186 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am shocked by your biased coverage of the Health Security Act, Prop. 186, on 
the Nov. 8 ballot. The poll published Sept. 11 asked whether voters favor a 
government-run health plan costing $75 billion in new taxes. This pejorative 
description of Prop. 186 assured the most negative response. The Oct. 5 article 
continues this one-sided coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere in the long article is there a description of the current health care 
crisis in California and the United States which has led to Prop. 186. This is 
a crisis driven by giant insurance companies and for-profit health maintenance 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago 45% of Californians were covered by "managed care" plans. This 
year the figure is 85%. The "for-profits" employ saturation advertising and 
solicitation of patients to draw them away from their independent physicians. 
The physicians are forced for economic survival to join the HMOs under any 
terms presented.  
</P>
<P>
 What savings are accomplished by the "for-profits" are by cost shifting and 
hard bargaining with hospitals. The hospitals are underutilized. They cannot 
afford to turn down drastically reduced rates paid by the HMOs. HMOs spend on 
the average 24 cents of every health care dollar on overhead, advertising and 
lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
 The article quotes the president of Cigna Health Care System and his 
rhetorical question is "if someone would like to show me a government agency 
capable of creating the fourth or fifth largest health care system in the world 
and manage it well, I'd like to see it." He sees it everyday. Medicare is that 
agency. It operates on an overhead of 2.5% in contrast to 24% in the health 
insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Prop. 186 is sound fiscally, based on very conservative fiscal analysis; $75 
billion in taxes replaces present health care premiums in a system that is 
costing Californians $100 billion this year. There will be a 4% cap on 
overhead. Spending under Prop. 186 can only rise with an increase in population 
or gross domestic product.  
</P>
<P>
 Under 186 companies with 10 or fewer employees will pay 4.4% of payroll for 
health care. Employers with more than 50 employees will pay 8-9%. Besides these 
savings, the cost for medical care in workers' compensation and disability 
insurance will disappear.  
</P>
<P>
 Individuals will pay 2.5% of their California taxable income for health care 
and will save so much on premiums and out-of-pocket payments that net costs for 
health care will decline for the large majority. This will be comprehensive 
care that is non-cancelable and provides free choice of doctors.

PRAISE FOR ED MCSPEDON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I had the privilege of serving as a commissioner on the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission from 1985-1989. During that time, we were very 
actively involved in building the Blue Line from Los Angeles to Long Beach and 
in planning and starting construction on the Metro Green Line; I was a member 
of the committees that directly oversaw the commission's construction 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on this experience, I do have concern over the press' treatment of the 
issues and the individuals involved. While I do not wish to minimize any 
concerns over the current subway difficulties, your paper should also recognize 
and call attention to the many professional awards and acknowledgments that 
have been awarded to the MTA and the Los Angeles rail construction program. I 
feel that many of these honors have been due to the professional skill and 
conduct of Ed McSpedon, who has been treated most harshly by the press. 
</P>
<P>
 I had the opportunity to work closely with McSpedon as he assumed 
responsibility for the commission's rail construction activities. From my 
personal perspective, I would like to convey that, during this entire four-year 
period, I found McSpedon to be a person of great personal and professional 
integrity. He was candid with the commissioners and brought issues of concern 
to our attention in a timely and forthright manner. His sensitivity and 
professional expertise saw us through the many difficulties that are inherent 
in any major construction effort and helped to bring rail service to the Los 
Angeles region in a timely manner. He truly earned the professional respect of 
the commission members, his own staff, and the engineering profession. 
</P>
<P>
 I think that it is important for a paper such as yours to present a major 
effort such as the rail construction program in an unbiased light. Yes, the 
project has had difficulties; but find me any major (or minor) construction 
effort that has been completed without them. The people in Los Angeles do need 
to know that there are dedicated and capable professionals working to build a 
quality rail transportation network that will serve our region for many years 
and that their efforts have earned peer recognition.

PUBLICITY IN THE O. J. SIMPSON CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I think that Judge Lance Ito greatly overreacted to Faye Resnick's book about 
O.J. and Nicole Simpson (Oct. 19 and 20). The book contains allegations that 
are detrimental to the reputation of each person. The potential jurors will use 
those allegations to reinforce their existing biases one way or the other. So 
the impact will not be significant. The composition of the jury will be 
dependent on the success of each side in rejecting jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 What the people don't need is a postponement of the trial and the release of 
Simpson on bail. It is illegal. On with the trial! Let the publicity fall where 
it may! That's as good as it gets for other defendants. Why is Simpson any 
different?

 * The Simpson defense team made a daily appearance before the TV cameras, and 
wailed that Resnick's book might have an influence on the Simpson jury. If they 
did not think their frequent appearances on TV did not influence the jury, then 
why are they doing it? Their jury consultant echoed a fear that the Resnick 
book would influence the jury. The consultant presumably is being paid 
(handsomely?) to do something that surely will influence the jury -- she is 
telling the defense counsel which jurors to pick to win their case. Is she not 
engaging in obstruction of justice? So far things have been more than fair for 
Simpson. Why can't "the people" get a fair trial, also?

 * Commenting on the Simpson news leaks and their potential impact on the jury, 
I see no compromise of Simpson's rights. I am a veteran of many jury panels. 
The judge instructs the jury to disregard everything they have read, seen or 
heard about the case outside of the courtroom. When both sides have rested, the 
judge again gives additional instruction on how the jury is to interpret the 
evidence. The judge defines the law violated and the options regarding the 
level of guilt if the defendant is found guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the above is well-documented and provided during deliberation. The 
jurors then can discuss, debate and challenge, but only the evidence given 
during the trial and the judge's instructions can be used to support their 
point of view.

TIGHTENING THE SCREWS ON NASDAQ EXCHANGE; PRESSURE IS APPLIED TO STOCK NETWORK 
FROM SEVERAL DIRECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is trading on the Nasdaq -- the nation's busiest stock exchange -- skewed 
against small investors? Questions about the fundamental fairness of the Nasdaq 
system have been raised by Times staff writer Scot J. Paltrow in a riveting 
six-part series on the exchange's controversial practices.  
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Securities Dealers, which operates the Nasdaq, maintains 
that all is in order at its exchange, where such familiar stocks as Microsoft, 
MCI and Apple trade daily. But the Justice Department's antitrust division 
recently confirmed that it is looking into alleged anti-competitive practices 
on Nasdaq, including possible price-fixing by market makers -- firms that put 
up their own money to "make a market" in particular Nasdaq stocks and act as 
dealers. Separately, class-action suits have been filed challenging Nasdaq 
practices. The Securities and Exchange Commission also is beginning to apply 
strong pressure on the exchange to address its problems. 
</P>
<P>
 FAR-FLUNG NETWORK: What makes the Nasdaq unique is that the stock exchange has 
no trading floor. It is a nationwide network of 510 market-making firms linked 
by a computer system and telephones. This fragmented electronic trading system, 
which has an average daily trading volume of 299 million shares, often fails to 
make the market's best prices available to small investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Paltrow's investigation found that individual investors are much more likely 
to get fair treatment for their trades on the New York Stock Exchange than on 
the Nasdaq (the name originally stood for National Assn. of Securities Dealers 
Automated Quotation system). On the NYSE, big and small orders are executed on 
a relatively equal footing. But on the Nasdaq, small investors get a worse 
price for their trades than large pension and mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The cornerstone of the nation's securities laws is the "best execution" rule. 
This is designed to guarantee that brokerage customers get the best price 
available when they put in orders to buy or sell stocks. A pattern of 
questionable Nasdaq practices and lax self-enforcement of Nasdaq requirements 
work to the disadvantage of small investors. 
</P>
<P>
 A fundamental problem is Nasdaq's wide spreads, or gaps, between the price 
that market makers are willing to pay to buy a stock and the price at which 
they are willing to sell. Nasdaq officials publicly deny that there is price 
collusion, but privately they have been pressing market makers to cut the 
spreads. 
</P>
<P>
 Other questionable Nasdaq practices are: "backing away," the illegal refusal 
by a market maker to honor the prices it posts in the Nasdaq computer system 
for buying or selling a stock; "trading through," when market makers continue 
to trade with the investing public at their quoted bid or asked prices, 
ignoring offers that are better for customers; "trading ahead" or "front 
running," in which a market maker buys or sells for the firm's own profit 
before dealing with an order from the firm's customers. Delayed reporting of 
trades also is a problem.  
</P>
<P>
 AID FOR 'LITTLE GUY': The SEC has proposed some strict protections for small 
investors. If they are approved, and they should be, Nasdaq market makers will 
no longer be allowed to let so-called limit orders from customers sit while 
they trade for themselves at better prices. But the market makers would not be 
required to accept such orders, so they might well choose not to take them at 
all. This is another loophole that should be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Creating a fair and equitable market is in the interest of Nasdaq and, more 
important, in the interest of the small investor. As the busiest and 
fastest-growing exchange, the Nasdaq should operate with greater openness and 
accessibility for small investors. The inequities on the exchange must be 
addressed quickly by both Nasdaq and the SEC.

UMBERG FOR STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren has taken an undeniably hard line on crime during his 
four years in office. He wholeheartedly supports Proposition 184, the "three 
strikes and you're out" ballot initiative, plus the existing "three-strikes" 
law. He is a strong proponent of the death penalty and of "hard time" for many 
juvenile offenders. His emphasis on punishment understandably resonates with 
Californians fed up with escalating street crime and revolving-door justice. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lungren does not have a corner on concern over crime. Nor does his 
approach to crime, in our view, represent the most efficient way to deploy this 
state's increasingly scarce resources. We think that his opponent, Assemblyman 
Tom Umberg, has articulated a more thoughtful and comprehensive vision of the 
job.  
</P>
<P>
 Umberg cannot be painted as a soft-on-crime Democrat. The Orange County 
moderate is a former assistant U.S. attorney; as an assemblyman he authored 
bills to increase penalties for hate crimes, rape and the sale of drugs on 
school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg strongly supports the "three-strikes" law and the death penalty but he 
also recognizes that California must make hard choices about law enforcement. 
The threat of severe punishment alone will not restore sanity to our streets, 
especially given the astronomical costs associated with enforcing the 
"three-strikes" law. That's why Umberg places a greater emphasis on proven 
efforts to prevent crime by at-risk juveniles. That's why he supports stronger 
gun control than Lungren to help keep firearms out of the hands of criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course the attorney general must enforce all the state's laws, not just the 
criminal code. The two men share a commitment to consumer protection and 
environmental preservation. They differ on abortion rights; Umberg is more 
supportive of a woman's right to choose. 
</P>
<P>
 A negative aspect of the Umberg candidacy is its television-ad suggestion that 
Lungren somehow could have done more to help police arrest the repeat felon now 
charged with murdering Polly Klaas. This vicious low blow has no place in any 
campaign, and Umberg should pull it immediately.

DON'T REWARD A TERRORIST STATE; SYRIA MUST END ITS CONNECTION TO ATROCITIES 
BEFORE WASHINGTON GRANTS ANY CONCESSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Given the chance to condemn terrorism publicly during his joint news 
conference with President Clinton in Damascus this week, Syria's President 
Hafez Assad chose instead to maintain an aloof silence. Asked about his own 
country's role in sponsoring and harboring terrorists, he could do no better 
than lamely assert that no one can prove Syria's guilt in these matters. These 
are not encouraging responses from the leader of a country that, this year as 
in years past, occupies a lead place on the State Department's list of 
countries involved in terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 That Syria is officially and rightly condemned for state terrorism means that 
Clinton assumed certain political risks when he decided to honor Assad by 
visiting him in his capital. Assad, while clearly relishing the honor, did 
nothing, however, to help out his visitor. Assad even denied that the subject 
of Syria's terrorism came up in his three or four hours of talks with Clinton. 
Clinton himself indicated the issue did too come up, but he does not seem to 
have pressed it forcefully. No doubt his rationale was that in the limited time 
available he wanted to focus on what Syria could do to move its peace 
negotiations with Israel along. Still, it's obvious Clinton missed a rare 
opportunity to make clear in plain and vigorous language that so long as Syria 
continues to play the terrorism game its relations with the United States will 
suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been left to others to make that point, most immediately to Sens. 
Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, and 
Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), who is on the Intelligence Committee. Both men 
accompanied Clinton to Damascus. Both also indicated after the Clinton-Assad 
meeting that they will oppose better relations with Syria until Assad acts to 
shut down the terrorist groups whose headquarters he permits in Damascus and 
Hezbollah, which operates out of Syrian-controlled southern Lebanon and which 
still receives a steady flow of Syrian arms and explosives. 
</P>
<P>
 Assad has always been shrewd in keeping his options open. Presumably he 
continues to regard Syria's association with terrorism -- something that 
burnishes his own credentials among Arabs as a radical activist -- as one more 
card to play in the long poker game of Middle East politics. If he ever gives 
it up it will be in exchange for something of high value. In fact he has things 
backward. What Washington should make emphatically clear is that first Syria 
must end its involvement with terrorism, then it will be possible to consider a 
closer bilateral relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 It's regrettable that in this, the second face-to-face meeting he has had with 
Assad since becoming President, Clinton didn't seize the chance to deliver that 
message unambiguously.

THE SCHOOL BOARD'S FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding Christian ideology and the upcoming South County school board 
elections, letter writer M.S. Smith (Oct. 16) makes two erroneous assumptions 
that bear correction. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Smith states, "South Orange County is dominated by conservative 
Christians, so what's wrong with a board of similar values?" Here's what's 
wrong with it. Contrary to Smith's contention that an extremist and a 
conservative are one and the same, informed voters realize that what separates 
a religious right extremist from a mainstream conservative believer is the 
extremist's belief that our government should enforce scriptural law and the 
extremist's willingness to subvert the democratic process to achieve this goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The stealth election of two religious extremists to the Saddleback Unified 
School District board has led to two years of contentious and 
obstruction-riddled board meetings. Religious right school board members have 
proven to be primarily concerned about advancing their dogmatic religious 
philosophy at the expense of the students and parents they are elected to 
represent. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Associate Pastor George Hooper of Shepherd of the Hills Church in 
Mission Viejo also has concerns about the Religious Right's involvement in 
local politics. It's obvious Rev. Hooper understands the First Amendment when 
he says, " . . . when one theological perspective is claimed as the only true 
Christian perspective on a political issue, it is demeaning to persons of all 
faiths." 
</P>
<P>
 Second, as a public school teacher beginning his 23rd year, I have had it up 
to my plan book with the insulting charge that our schools are failing and 
that, as Smith writes, "nothing could be worse than what we have now." 
</P>
<P>
 I invite Smith and other doomsayers to check out the numbers for themselves. 
By any standard of measurement -- standardized achievement tests, the SAT, 
percentage of students graduated, percentage of students attending colleges and 
universities after graduation -- Saddleback Valley and Capistrano Unified rank 
among the top school districts in the United States.

 I was thoroughly disgusted with the on-field antics of Deion Sanders and Andre 
Rison during the San Francisco-Atlanta game on Oct. 16. The fight and Sanders' 
obnoxious display during the interception return were equally repugnant. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more disturbing, however, were the reactions by all parties of the NFL. 
The officials did not have the guts to throw these two jerks out of the game. 
The coaches didn't have the courage to bench them. The owners did not reprimand 
the players and the league fined each of them a meaningless $7,500. Players 
like this need to be forced to sit out the next game to send the right message.

 I am shocked, angry and disgusted at the news that millions of dollars in 
bonuses will be paid to the executives and other employees of the World Cup. 
All those people were paid for their employment and the upper-echelon people 
were paid in the six-figure range. Seven million dollars for Alan Rothenberg? 
Give me a break. 
</P>
<P>
 The profits of the World Cup were supposedly earmarked for the advancement of 
the sport in this country. Playing fields, equipment, coaching, etc. Wasn't the 
World Cup Organizing Committee a nonprofit organization? And what about all 
those volunteers who spent tens of thousands of hours to pull this thing off. 
If somebody was entitled to a bonus, it was them and not those executives. As 
it shows clearly now, most people in the World Cup organization were in it for 
the money, not for the sport of soccer. For them, it might as well have been a 
turtle race.

NHL OWNERS PLAYING GAMES WITH TICKET MONEY, NOT ON THE ICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, let me get this straight. I pay a lot of money in July (not counting the 
rollover of last February's playoff money) to watch a whole season of hockey, 
including mandatory full-price exhibition games.Owners play the exhibitions, 
costing them nothing, then lock out players and fans, then they dictate refund 
policy? Policies that include losing your seat priority number if you take any 
of your money back, which you can't have until they actually cancel home games, 
which they still haven't done? They've canceled four games, but they aren't 
going to tell us which ones, so no refunds. Is this good faith? Does anyone 
even know what that term means? 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Bettman's lack of either a new starting date or a season cancellation is a 
blatant license for owners to hold onto ticket money. Why should the owners try 
to settle? So long as they hold a season's worth of ticket revenues in their 
accounts, earning money every day, they aren't compelled to have hockey. 
Profits without payroll, what a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The "refund guidelines" are a farce. I wasn't giving management an 
interest-free loan for six months or more when I signed my check. Either 
provide the promised services or give me my money back, and I mean all of it.

 Al Davis didn't hire Tom Flores because he was Latino or Art Shell because he 
is black; he hired them to produce winners.The Raiders made lots of money out 
of being society's outcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know if Shell said something that someone could construe as racist to 
Jeff Hostetler. Neither one of them, and certainly no one else on the Raiders, 
is going to confirm that he did. 
</P>
<P>
 If Art Shell had an un-Kodak moment in the heat of battle, as Hostetler said, 
"Let it go!"

 The Raiders might have finally found an adequate ground force in Harvey 
Williams, but the fans will not forgive Al Davis for depriving them of seeing 
Marcus Allen in the years that he was benched, then trading him to the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Marcus been playing, instead of warming the bench, he could have been the 
one honored with the most touchdowns and the Raiders might have won another 
Super Bowl by now.

 Is there something about pro-business Orange County that somehow lulls these

HE'S PUTTING WALSH ON THE DEFENSIVE

<TEXT>
<P>
 With each Stanford defeat and San Francisco 49er victory, it is becoming 
obvious that the real "genius" behind the 49er glory days was George Seifert, 
the defensive coordinator under Bill Walsh. Until Stanford fields a solid 
defense, all the offensive ingenuity in the world will not land Bill Walsh in 
the Rose Bowl.

OPERA REVIEW; UNVEILING OF 'SCARLET LETTER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to daring operatic ventures in the Southland, it seems that all 
roads lead to Long Beach, whose small-but-tough opera company is known for 
adventurous pluck. 
</P>
<P>
 The operatic muse was in town again Thursday night, as Martin Herman's "The 
Scarlet Letter" had its world premiere in the Carpenter Center at Cal State 
Long Beach. The production is an impressive in-house effort by the Opera 
Ensemble of CSLB, with generous outside help. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from some opening night executional glitches (the brief run concludes 
Sunday afternoon), the performance left a strong, clear impression. Most 
important, it signified that all-too-rare occurrence on the current musical 
scene: a premiere of a fully realized new opera. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathaniel Hawthorne's pre-modern, proto-feminist tale of social hypocrisy, 
individualism versus the wheels of injustice, and feminine prowess makes for a 
ripe operatic vehicle, a fact well-understood by librettist Thomas F. Curley. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of musical language, Herman veers in multiple directions, leaning on 
Berg-like atonality during tense passages and post-Romantic Strauss-isms during 
more tender moments. The finale is jarringly cloying, as our heroine 
pronounces, axiomatically, "be true, be true" into the moonset. 
</P>
<P>
 This pluralistic tack works well for the most part, creating an amalgam that 
gives the work a bold and post-modern character, but it sometimes leads to a 
confused context. The alternately somber and quietly heroic nature of the 
narrative doesn't always hold up under shifting stylistic ploys. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong vocal cast included a luminous Tracy Strand as scarlet-garbed Hester 
Prynne, Eli Villanueva as the duplicitous Chillingworth, and Music Center Opera 
denizens Greg Fedderly and Jonathan Mack, in fine form. Brent McMunn, director 
of the opera program at Cal State Long Beach, conducted a smallish orchestra 
for maximum impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Stage director Philip Littell, whose recent claim to questionable fame was as 
the librettist for the recent production of "The Dangerous Liaisons" in San 
Francisco, lightly disperses the action across economical sets by Chontelle 
Gray. She paints a fine, visually poetic scene by deploying projections, 
scrims, cutouts and Spartan props. 
</P>
<P>
 On this night, there were skill and grand operatic ambition aplenty in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Scarlet Letter," produced by the CSULB music and theater departments 
and the Carpenter Performing Arts Center, continues at the Carpenter center, 
Cal State Long Beach, 6200 Atherton St., Long Beach. Tonight at 8 and Sunday at 
2 p.m. $18 to $25. Lectures by composer Martin Herman and director Philip 
Littell will be given an hour before each performance in the Gerald R. Daniel 
Recital Hall next to the center. (310) 985-7000.

POP BEAT: FREEDY JOHNSTON'S 'PERFECT WORLD'. . . WELL, SORT OF; HIS MAJOR-LABEL 
DEBUT IS A SUCCESS WITH CRITICS AND CONSUMERS -- AND A 'SHOCK' FOR THE GUY WHO 
GREW UP WITH NO AMBITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The music on Freedy Johnston's acclaimed "This Perfect World" album might be 
classically proportioned, meticulously crafted, highly accessible pop. But the 
temperament of its creator is as edgy as that of the most alienated 
punk-rocker. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the idyllic small town where horrors unfold in David Lynch's "Blue 
Velvet," Johnston's winsome melodies, seductive arrangements and plaintive 
vocals deliver complex, detailed stories of treachery, loss and desperation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aching title song, a father returns to face the daughter he left 
behind, and whose mother he murdered. "Evie's Tears" are the result of a girl's 
molestation by a priest that has left her emotionally disabled. A recurring 
motif reflects Johnston's own path, depicting a character moving to the city 
from the countryside and losing his bearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the products of a sunny sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a morbid, totally depressed person," says Johnston, 33. "But I do 
kind of tend to be a pessimist, or maybe more of a realist. I always see the 
poignancy and the bittersweet angle in something before I see the joy. That's a 
problem I have, but at least I admit it. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I have a good time. . . . At the end of the day though, I guess my overall 
feeling of what you can do in life or what you can expect out of life is fairly 
black, hopeless." 
</P>
<P>
 That's why he's "in shock" over the events of the past several months, a time 
in which his major-label debut album has met with widespread acceptance from 
alternative and adult-alternative radio stations around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Elektra Records has shipped nearly 100,000 copies of the critically praised 
collection to retailers, making Johnston (who plays the Whisky and McCabe's 
next weekend) one of the year's notable arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't been a conventional road to success for Johnston, who grew up 
without much ambition in the isolation of central Kansas. He eventually made 
his way to New York and recorded two albums for the independent Bar None label. 
The second, 1992's "You Can Fly," drew loads of critical attention, leading to 
his deal with Elektra. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston's initial inspiration came at age 10, when he lived for a time with 
his grandparents in Phoenix. There he borrowed his grandfather's FM radio, and 
late at night he heard such early-'70s staples as Steve Miller's "The Joker," 
Elton John's "Benny & the Jets," Wings' "Band on the Run," and David Essex's 
"Rock On." 
</P>
<P>
 "It just totally transfixed me and changed my life," he says. "I had this wild 
dream from then on that I was gonna be like Elton John, or I was gonna be like 
this rock star. . . . But I never pursued it in any coherent fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 He got there, though, more or less, and with his success he's attained some 
form of personal deliverance.  
</P>
<P>
 "Being a musician is the only club I've ever really belonged to," he says in 
his rapid cadence. "It's the only time in my life that I've ever wanted to be 
part of anything, and it just really moves me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forget it man, I've never done anything in my life. I've never done 
(expletive). I went to high school, hung out, partyin' out at the lake, 
drinkin' beers listenin' to Aerosmith. I moved to Lawrence, Kansas and worked 
in restaurants for years, moved to New York and did the same. Nothin'. Now this 
is something that gives my life real meaning . . . pretty much for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Does that mean he's desperate to sustain it? 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I've spent all my money, all my time, I've given up the hope or the 
chance of having a relationship or kids, or even a real home with carpets on 
the floor, sold everything I've had, spent 15 years of my life staying in a 
(expletive) room writing little songs. Man, I'm not goin' away." 
</P>

MUSIC REVIEW; WELSER-MOST: AN IMPULSIVE GUEST AT PHILHARMONIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>

 What a difference three days make. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, the Los Angeles Philharmonic celebrated its 75th birthday with a gala 
benefit concert that enlisted two stellar music directors (one present, one 
past) and attracted a full house at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. For better 
or worse, this was a special night. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday -- same time, same place -- it was business as usual. Franz 
Welser-Most, an Austrian guest-conductor from London, manned the podium, and 
the hall virtually yawned with empty seats. Glamour comes and glamour goes. 
</P>
<P>
 Welser-Most is no stranger to our orchestra, and he elicited wonderful sounds. 
He favors lighter, brighter, more transparent textures than are cultivated by 
either of his immediate predecessors -- Esa-Pekka Salonen and Zubin Mehta -- 
and our ever-adaptable players give him what he wants. They give it, moreover, 
with considerable panache and remarkable precision. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean, however, that the dashing and youthful maestro (born in 
1960) can transform every timbre into musical gold. On this occasion he 
achieved something of a personal triumph in the first half of the program, only 
to enter trouble-territory in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 He opened the concert with Anton Webern's "Im Sommerwind," a splashy idyll 
written in 1904 when the composer was an eager and innocent 21. Welser-Most 
began this little nostalgic flight with a resonant hush that heralded, and 
accommodated, great dynamic contrasts. He went on to define the theatrical 
indulgences with vitality that never precluded finesse. It was lovely. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar attributes enlivened Schubert's "little" C-major Symphony, No. 6, 
written in 1818 when this composer also was an eager and innocent 21. 
Welser-Most soared through the pretty platitudes with dauntless propulsion and 
buoyant spirit. It was elegant, and it was invigorating. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after intermission, came Brahms -- specifically the Fourth Symphony. 
This is a dark, brooding, majestic opus, written in 1885 when the composer was 
an emphatically mature 52. Unfortunately, Welser-Most imposed the same 
interpretive stances that had served him so well for Webern and Schubert. 
</P>
<P>
 He ignored the non troppo marking of the opening allegro non troppo, stressing 
breathless speed at its own expense. He ignored the moderato marking of the 
subsequent andante. There was nothing playful in his overwrought allegro 
giocoso, and the climactic finale -- allegro energico e passionato -- was 
slashed beyond the stridency threshold. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance turned out to be undeniably exciting in its snazzy, impulsive, 
wrong-headed way. But it wasn't stylish, it wasn't sensitive, and it certainly 
wasn't mellow. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps all Brahms conductors under 60 should be forced to listen to the 
recordings of Bruno Walter. Or Carlo Maria Giulini. 
</P>
<P>
 Welser-Most, incidentally, is about to give up his embattled post as music 
director of the London Philharmonic in favor of the Zurich Opera. His regime in 
London has been artistically controversial, to say the least, and the inherent 
problems have been well documented in the press. One would never guess it, 
however, from the biographical blurb in the Music Center program that blithely 
calls him one of the "most successful young conductors to lead a major 
symphonic ensemble." 
</P>
<P>
 In context, the gentle revisionism shouldn't surprise anyone. The same program 
magazine contains flimsy anecdotal annotations by Jim Svejda that claim, among 
other debatable distortions, that Webern, "like Schoenberg, remained a Romantic 
to the very end." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh dear. 
</P>
<P>
 * Welser-Most and the L.A. Philharmonic repeat the same program at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion of the Music Center Sunday at 2:30 p.m., tickets $6 to $50 at 
the box office and commercial outlets. "Family matinee" today at 2:30 (Schubert 
and Brahms only), tickets $5 to $35. Information: (213) 850-2000.

WAITING FOR THE GAVEL TO FALL; AS NEW YORK AWAITS ITS AUTUMN ART AUCTIONS, 
DEALERS ARE ANXIOUSLY WONDERING IF THEMARKET'S RECOVERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In the market for a flashy portrait of Marilyn Monroe by Andy Warhol? It could 
be yours for a mere $2.5 million to $3 million, at Christie's big sale of 
contemporary art on Wednesday in New York. And that isn't bad, considering that 
Los Angeles collector Max Palevsky sold the same painting to a Japanese dealer 
for $4.07 million in 1989, when the market was overheated. 
</P>
<P>
 If melancholy images are more to your taste, there's a 1919 painting of Amedeo 
Modigliani's mistress Jeanne Hebuterne, who ended her misery after the artist's 
death in 1920 by throwing herself out of a window. Sotheby's expects to sell 
the portrait for more than $5 million in its Nov. 8 sale of Impressionist and 
modern art. 
</P>
<P>
 If, on the other hand, you prefer the patina of Renaissance treasures, you 
might consider a 72-page illustrated scientific manuscript by Leonardo da 
Vinci, which is expected to fetch more than $10 million on Nov. 11 at 
Christie's. Called the "Codex Hammer" after the late oil magnate Armand Hammer, 
who purchased the manuscript in 1980 for $5.1 million, the rare document is 
being sold by the UCLA/Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center. (The 
Leonardo was consigned to Christie's as a hedge against a potentially 
devastating lawsuit, which was subsequently dismissed, but the museum now plans 
to use auction proceeds to establish a reserve fund for other legal expenses 
and -- if money is left over -- to purchase other artworks.) 
</P>
<P>
 And so it goes as the art world prepares for New York's traditional fall art 
auction season. Contemporary art sales on Tuesday through Thursday, followed by 
Impressionist and modern art auctions on Nov. 8-10 and the Nov. 11 Leonardo 
sale are expected to draw crowds of dealers, curators and collectors to 
Manhattan. Meanwhile, a much larger audience will follow the sales at a 
distance in an attempt to determine the health of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Warhol, Modigliani and Leonardo works are among items that will be closely 
watched in the upcoming parade of auctions. But their multimillion-dollar 
valuations are the exception. While pre-sale estimates of $1 million or more 
were commonplace during the late 1980s, Sotheby's and Christie's priciest sale 
catalogues are now full of artworks valued at a few hundred thousand dollars. 
One reason is that prices fell when speculators and Japanese collectors bailed 
out; another is that potential sellers are holding onto prime pieces until a 
more opportune moment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warhol -- called "Shot Red Marilyn" because it was pierced by a bullet 
fired by a disgruntled Warhol associate in the artist's studio -- will undergo 
particularly intense scrutiny since the value of Warhol's work has been 
questioned in an acrimonious legal battle between the artist's foundation and 
Edward Hayes, the estate's former attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Palevsky cashed in on the painting when he sold it at auction for a record 
$4.07 million to Tokyo dealer Kazuo Fujii, on behalf of an unidentified client. 
Now -- five years later -- the portrait is being sold by an anonymous private 
collector, reportedly Tokyo collector Masao Wanibuchi, who is apparently 
willing to take a big loss. Instead of making excuses for the artwork's drop in 
value, Christie's is advertising its confidence in the picture -- and promoting 
a shopping opportunity for bargain hunters -- by putting "Shot Red Marilyn" on 
the cover of its auction catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 In next week's sales of contemporary art, Sotheby's will offer 404 works, 
valued at a total of $22.4 million to $29.9 million. Among objects of special 
interest, two-dozen pieces by such major figures as Willem de Kooning, Philip 
Guston and Hans Hofmann have been consigned by the estate of art critic Harold 
Rosenberg. De Kooning's 1953 charcoal drawing, "Monumental Woman," valued at 
$400,000 to $600,000, is expected to bring the top price in the Rosenberg 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Christie's will put 234 contemporary pieces on the block, at an estimated 
total value of $15.9 million to $20 million. Among the highlights are 32 works 
by artists such as Francesco Clemente, Eric Fischl and Susan Rothenberg from 
the estate of Chicago attorney and collector Gerald S. Elliott. The most 
expensive item ($400,000 to $600,000) is Frank Stella's trapezoid-shaped purple 
painting, "Ileana Sonnabend," named for the New York art dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 The following round of sales, on Nov. 8-10, will feature Impressionist and 
modern art. Sotheby's will offer 355 works valued at $48.2 million to $65.1 
million, including a Vincent Van Gogh drawing, "Wheat Field With Sheaves" ($2 
million to $3 million), and a half-dozen minor works by Pablo Picasso. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Christie's has lined up 381 Impressionist and modern works valued at $56 
million to $75.6 million. They include 85 pieces from the estate of Gertrude 
Bernoudy, a Czech emigre who settled in New York and later lived in St. Louis 
with her husband, the late architect William Adair Bernoudy. Frequently 
purchasing art from New York dealer Curt Valentin, Gertrude Bernoudy acquired 
works by Georges Braque, Giorgio Morandi, Paul Klee and Lyonel Feininger, among 
many others. 
</P>
<P>
 Christie's also is offering works from the collection of the late New York 
arts patron Alice Tully. Among them is "La chambre d'ecoute," Surrealist Rene 
Magritte's 1958 painting of a green apple that fills an entire room. Its 
selling price is estimated at $300,000 to $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 While the sales of contemporary, modern and Impressionist works are expected 
to attract their usual audiences, the market for the Leonardo manuscript is the 
subject of speculation. The work contains more than 300 sketches and diagrams, 
but art experts generally say it is of greater value as a scientific document 
than as an artwork. Touted as the last manuscript by the Renaissance master 
that is likely to come on the market, it is probably best suited to a museum or 
research library. But few institutions have sufficient resources to make such a 
purchase, so it may be destined for a private collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Christie's has published a hard-cover book on the "Codex Hammer" 
and sent the Leonardo on tour to woo potential buyers. During the past few 
weeks the work has traveled to Milan, Zurich, Seoul and Tokyo before returning 
to New York, where it will go on view Nov. 5-10 in Christie's showroom.

'SISTERS' BRINGS CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE TO LIGHT; TELEVISION: THE MUCH-DEBATED 
TOPIC IS SUPPRESSED MEMORY OF SEXUAL ABUSE, AND THE ROLE THERAPISTS PLAY IN 
SUDDEN RECOLLECTIONS.

</HEADLINE>

<P>
 More than 20 years after the event, an adult woman remembers that her father 
sexually molested her when she was a child -- an experience so traumatic that 
she apparently erased it from her memory, until, while in therapy for help with 
a bad self-image, it all comes roaring back. 
</P>
<P>
 Recovered memory of sexual abuse is probably the most sensitive issue in the 
world of psychiatry today, having spawned a bitter controversy between those 
who strongly believe in the veracity of such memories and those who believe 
that most of these recollections are made up, implanted by manipulative or 
incompetent therapists. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue had its day in court earlier this spring in a sensational Northern 
California trial in which a man who claimed he was falsely accused of raping 
his daughter years earlier won a judgment against his daughter's therapist. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is grist for "Sisters," NBC's Saturday-night melodrama about four 
grown-up sisters and the sometimes tragic, often farcical days of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first notion of doing an incest story came from a friend of ours in Ohio, 
who was telling us that his wife had been molested by her stepfather," said Ron 
Cowen, who, with Daniel Lipman, created and executive produces the series. "And 
when she told her mother, her mother threw her out of the house and her 
brothers and sisters called her a liar and a troublemaker and stopped speaking 
to her."  
</P>
<P>
 So it wasn't "headline-grabbing" that motivated them, Cowen said. "We thought 
it would be a good story for our characters because it was shocking to us that 
the mother would side with the husband and (that) the siblings would turn on 
her. And since our show is based on family and memories of the past and how 
with family we live in the past as much as the present, since this was a 
memory, it made sense too to play with the idea of 'Is it real? Is it true or 
false?' " 
</P>
<P>
 But playing with that idea is like playing catch with a hand grenade. After 
the first episode this season, the producers received two letters. One was from 
a member of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation -- a group of families that 
have been torn apart because of what they claim were false accusations of past 
abuse -- thanking them for showing the public that at least some of these 
memories are fabricated. The other came from a woman who said she was abused by 
her father and accused "Sisters" of belittling everyone who was ever molested 
by casting doubt on their recollections. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview in their Burbank office, the producers refused to take sides 
in the debate, nor would they reveal how the story line -- one of many going on 
simultaneously in the series -- would ultimately turn out. 
</P>
<P>
 Through five episodes so far, the character of Georgie (played by Patricia 
Kalember) has, with the help of a heavy-handed and unscrupulous therapist 
(Daniel Gerroll), recalled a memory of her long-dead father molesting her as a 
child. When she confides the memory -- one she herself doubts at the outset -- 
to her disbelieving mother and sisters, hostility erupts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, as the relationship between Georgie and her therapist plays out, 
the show will take a strong point of view, the producers said. And, from the 
look of things, the therapist is primed to be the fall guy: He suggested that 
patients struggling with similar issues of low self-esteem and inability to 
express big emotions were usually "beaten or molested as children"; he is 
cloying -- often calling Georgie "kiddo" rather than by name -- and, in 
tonight's episode, he has sex with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we out to say that these kinds of memories are bunk? No," Cowen said. "In 
certain instances they might be true and very helpful, and in others it might 
be a false memory and wreck all kinds of relationships. It's individual every 
time. We're not making any blanket condemnation of repressed memory and saying 
it's baloney. It's just something that is interesting within the context of our 
television family and how it ripples through them and causes conflict." 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict extends beyond the screen, however. Michael Yapko, a San Diego 
psychologist who wrote a recent controversial book indicting many mental health 
professionals for leading patients to mistakenly believe they are victims of 
abuse, was horrified at the description of the therapist's behavior in 
"Sisters." He said the therapist's suggestion that Georgie's problems of 
self-esteem usually indicates some past abuse "represents gross incompetence -- 
precisely the kind of therapy that I have railed against. It's offensive." 
</P>
<P>
 It does happen, Yapko admitted. But even if the producers are mirroring an 
actual bad therapist, he deplored such a "crappy Hollywood script that has the 
therapist sleeping with his client," because that tells some viewers that 
therapy is dangerous and could discourage those who really do need help for 
depression or anxiety from seeking it. "That is a tragedy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to be irresponsible, but we're not into this PC thing," 
producer Lipman said. "If you tread too tenderly so you don't offend anyone, 
then there isn't any story other than everyone being nice to each other. We 
have tried to make the therapist as professional as possible but, on the other 
hand, any dramatic form bends realism and heightens it to make it more 
dramatic. We're not out to damn an entire profession -- (to say) that all 
shrinks are bad. But I'm sure we're bound to raise some ire." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Pamela Freyd, executive director of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation, 
an organization that claims that many of these recovered memories are false and 
the work of manipulative therapeutic techniques, said the depiction of an 
unethical therapist "muddies up the issues."  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned that the person involved in implanting the false memory may be 
portrayed as being particularly bad, and that clearly oversimplifies the 
situation because we have many reports that this happens in situations where 
the therapist is completely ethical and well-meaning," Freyd said. "But 
anything that can raise the issue so that people think about it on a 
case-by-case basis will help to inform the public and offer a reminder that we 
need to exert more care in this area and not get carried away by fads."

JAZZ REVIEW; A NIGHT OF INSTRUMENTAL DUELS, DUETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The duo performance can be the musical equivalent of one-on-one basketball. Or 
it can be a team effort, with players relying on complement rather than 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Both roads were taken Thursday at System M as the California Outside Musicians 
Assn. (COMA) sponsored a program dubbed "Night of Duets" featuring three 
different pairings of musicians, all of whom have an unbounded sense of their 
craft. 
</P>
<P>
 While the term "duet" might conjure up visions of violin-piano recitals in 
stuffy drawing rooms, this outing was anything but stuffy. "Outside" was the 
operative word -- there was little in the way of accessible beats or melodies. 
But each duo provided fascinating examples of interplay and instrumental 
rivalry, with sounds that ranged from soothing to mind-crushing. 
</P>
<P>
 That both approaches -- competitive and complementary -- had their merits was 
most apparent in the pairing of guitarists Nels Cline and Ken Ando. Their long, 
electrically charged set was a sort-of suite built on impressionistic readings 
of music from the films of Charlotte Rampling. 
</P>
<P>
 With photocopied pictures of the actress taped to their amplifiers and Cline 
wearing a cap emblazoned with the cult star's first name, the "Charlotte 
Shrine" paid appropriately twisted homage to Rampling's uneven career. 
</P>
<P>
 Though even die-hard fans might have had trouble recognizing soundtrack 
snatches from "The Night Porter" and "Orca," there could be no doubt about 
Cline and Ando's devotion to the music's intent.  
</P>
<P>
 Cline opened by drawing a metal tube across the his electric 12-string, 
painting frightening walls of sound that Ando hung with pops, clicks and fuzz 
tones. The two meshed when Ando's whale cries were backed by Cline's chordal 
heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, they were at odds again, slapping their instruments in abusive 
style while hurling feedback back and forth shouting-match style. Later, Cline 
used a metal whisk to whip up more sonic bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 The team of multi-instrumentalist Vinny Golia and trombonist Michael 
Vlatkovich seemed civilized by comparison. Working unamplified, the two 
developed theme-and-variation figures, trading lead duties politely, only 
occasionally wrestling for the spotlight. Vlatkovich opened playing quietly 
muted behind Golia's meandering flute lines, adding counterpoint to his 
partner's swirling declarations. Without a break, Golia switched to clarinet 
and the music began to accelerate. Golia's Philip Glass-inspired figure backed 
the trombonist's questioning improvisation. Then Vlatkovich began to swing 
pleasantly as Golia strapped on his baritone sax. 
</P>
<P>
 The blend of bone and baritone made for a warm, burnished sound and the two 
used it for a lyrical exchange. Golia sounded some elephant calls before 
switching to sopranino, a move that instantly elevated the exchange as he 
filled their play with long, inquiring lines and short bursts that resembled 
birdcalls. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The evening's opening set found drummer Richie West making sense of Woody 
Aplanap's scuttling guitar lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The most accessible of the evening's duos -- due mainly to West's rhythmic 
discipline -- their set explored pieces with such quirky titles "Sidney the 
Kidney" and "Donald Duck." At one point during "Duck," Aplanap dropped in a 
single phrase from Thelonious Monk's "Well You Needn't." Despite the pure 
improvisational nature of the "Night of Duets," it was the evening's only clear 
jazz reference.

THEATER REVIEW; THE FOG NEVER CLEARS IN CRC'S 'MACBETH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By M.E. WARREN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Macbeth" has the reputation in theatrical circles as an unlucky play. Actors 
call it "The Scottish Play" so as not to call down upon themselves the curse 
associated with uttering the proper name of this brutal, haunted story of 
ambition run amok. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been blamed for onstage deaths, hauntings and all manner of ill 
fortune. It is acknowledged as a play of tremendous power: to quote it in the 
dressing room is to invite disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 California Repertory Company's production desperately attempts to conjure up 
some of this malevolent majesty by pouring dry-ice fog onto the stage and 
underscoring the entire play with atmospheric music. But dime-store creepiness 
is no substitute for storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Ronald Allan-Lindblom's direction, CRC's "Macbeth" is virtually 
unintelligible. The text is rattled off at such a rate that it frequently 
sounds like a completely foreign language. The emotional side of the drama is 
eviscerated by Jamieson Price's one-dimensional performance as Macbeth. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole production seems to say, "We know you know this story, so we'll just 
get on with it as quickly as possible." Only the glimpses of passion in 
Penelope Miller-Lindblom's passionate Lady Macbeth relieve the boredom 
significantly.  
</P>
<P>
 Blake Steury, Greg Mortensen and Armando Jose Duran have some good moments, 
too, but if you don't know the story going in, you will be hard pressed to 
figure out how they fit into it. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Gruber's imposing set of relentless, hard-angled gray and the 
Celtic-flavored witches -- Susan Scudder, Teresa Dowell and Susannah MacAdams 
-- work what spells they can. But the black magic of this "Macbeth" never 
leaves the dressing room.

 Babs Speaks: Barbra Streisand delivered a speech at Friday's Hollywood Women's 
Political Committee luncheon, which honored First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
"For the first time in over a decade, we have an administration that truly 
cares about the American people," Streisand said. The singer also discussed 
California politics -- expressing her opposition to Proposition 187, Gov. Pete 
Wilson and "the radical right, who have been busy organizing at the grass-roots 
level." Gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown was among the political figures 
present at the luncheon. Comedian Whoopi Goldberg introduced the First Lady.

Manhattan, asks the court to find that the Chicago-based foundation is the true 
owner of the property under a deed of gift signed by Nureyev on Oct. 21, 1992. 
The foundation said in its suit that it has arranged to sell the dancer's 
personal property including furniture, artwork and musical instruments at a 
public auction in January. However, lawyers representing certain members of 
Nureyev's family have notified the foundation they intend to file suit to stop

'WORSHIP' SEEKS SPIRITUAL IDENTITY; ART: FIDELIA ANYIA, WHOSE WORK IS ON VIEW 
IN FULLERTON, TAKES THE INSPIRATION FOR HER CERAMIC VESSELS AND WALL PLAQUES 
FROM BENI TRADITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The contemporary-art world can be said to have its own set of rituals and 
rites, but the opening today of an exhibit in Cal State Fullerton's East 
Gallery will draw upon a deeper tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 In what artist Fidelia Anyia describes as a blend of performance art and the 
ceremonial, a chief priest of Benin, A.E. Ogiemwanye, will perform a cleansing 
and preparation of the exhibit, as he might do for a religious shrine. 
</P>
<P>
 The connection between the ritual and Anyia's work in the exhibit, titled 
"Worship Art," is not a spurious one. Anyia came to Cal State Fullerton two 
years ago from her home in Benin, a kingdom in Nigeria, and she takes the 
inspiration for her ceramic vessels and wall plaques from Beni tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandmother was a traditionalist," Anyia, 28, said this week. "Her father 
before her was a very powerful medicine man." 
</P>
<P>
 Although her grandmother eventually converted to Catholicism, she still 
performed many of the old rites, which Anyia would watch when she visited 
there. Later, because Anyia's mother married into Benin's royal family, she was 
able to witness and study palace rituals. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, her interest in the traditional has increased since she came to 
Fullerton, and she's become particularly fascinated with the Olokun cult. 
</P>
<P>
 Olokun is the river goddess and is associated with fertility, longevity and 
wealth. In traditional Beni society, people are conceived of a particular 
deity, and Anyia's grandmother "was a water person," the artist said. Her 
grandmother's relationship with Olokun had its practical consequences -- "She 
could never go close to water" -- as well as spiritual ones. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anyia's works, collectively titled "The Olokun Series," employ symbols and 
forms echoing those found on pottery used in ceremonies connected to Olokun. 
She also uses the works to explore wider issues of spirituality. 
</P>
<P>
 The works address "relationships between things that exist in my culture that 
also exist in other cultures," Anyia said. Specifically, she said, the works 
are about a need for spiritual identity: "They tell a story about the human 
search." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyia studied ceramics at the University of Benin in Benin City and was taught 
by two master teachers -- one a hand builder, one a wheel thrower. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try as much as possible to combine all forms of ceramics." Her "Worship 
Art" exhibit is one of her requirements to complete a master of fine arts 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogiemwanye, the Beni priest who will take part today, lives most of the time 
in Long Beach but returns annually to Nigeria to officiate over initiations. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Worship Art" opens today with a public reception from 4 to 9 p.m. in the 
East Gallery of the Cal State Fullerton Visual Arts Center, 800 N. State 
College Blvd. The ceremonial portion of the reception will begin at 5:30 p.m. 
Regular gallery hours are weekdays, noon to 4 p.m. Through Nov. 3. Free. (714)

L.A. MASTER CHORALE TO BEGIN USING CONCERT SUPERTITLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRETA BEIGEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to broaden its audience appeal, the Los Angeles Master Chorale 
will follow the lead of America's major opera companies and introduce 
supertitles -- texts superimposed on a screen high above the stage -- at 
several of its upcoming concerts at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the season opener Sunday night, projected titles will translate the 
composer's intent in two works on an all-Brahms program: "Alto Rhapsody," with 
mezzo-soprano Claudia Carlson as soloist, and " Ein deutsches Requiem ," with 
soprano Tamara Crout Matthews and baritone David Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Music Center Opera, which has employed titles since its 
inception, is loaning the Chorale its equipment. David Anglin, LACMO 
supertitles coordinator, is supplying the texts on a free-lance basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be translating entire scores, including solo parts and chorus," says 
Anglin, who claims to be fluent in French and Italian, but is still trying to 
improve his German. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a sense this will be easier than opera where there are more words per 
square inch and because there is a higher degree of unpredictability in 
performance. In a choral work, if I go to a rehearsal I am confident the 
performance will go the same way." 
</P>
<P>
 To make things easier, the Chorale is supplying Anglin with an English 
translation of the "Requiem" -- officials are unable to identify the originator 
of the text -- which it has used successfully at previous performances. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an acceptable translation which we respect highly and we have asked 
David to work from that," says General Manager Maurice Staples. "This goes back 
to our philosophy that if we provide a translation, the audience is able to 
better understand and appreciate our repertory." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether audiences embrace the innovation remains to be seen. Despite the 
widespread adoption in the last decade of supertitles in both English and 
foreign-language opera productions, the debate over their validity continues. 
While promoters insist that translations make the art form more accessible to 
the masses, detractors groan about annoying distractions and false readings of 
what is really transpiring on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 But Staples believes that in the long run patrons will find the experience 
rewarding. Previously, the Chorale has supplied printed texts or translations 
either directly in the program or as special inserts. That practice 
necessitated that the house lights remain bright and often resulted in 
disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
 "People arrive at the bottom of the page at the same time, and having 3,000 
pages turned in the middle of a sublime moment ruins musical nerves and 
shatters musical moments," Staples explains. "We have to pay for the printed 
texts, and although this will cost a little more -- he puts the price at $5,000 
-- we believe it will be more beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the text is not understood a great deal can be lost, especially to 
audiences that are new to choral music. Somewhere out there there will be a 
purist who will attend the concert, see this and wonder why it is necessary. 
But we believe by far the majority will appreciate it." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Los Angeles Master Chorale opens a seven-concert series Sunday at 7:30 
p.m. at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. Supertitles will also accompany 
selections on the program, "Cancionces Para Los Angeles," on Nov. 19, Bach's 
St. John Passion on April 2 and Walton's "Belshazzar's Feast" on May 14. 
Tickets run $18, $14. For information: (213) 626-0901; Ticketmaster (213)

THEY'RE GUILELESS -- IT'S BLUESTIME; POP MUSIC: MAGIC DICK AND JAY GEILS, 
REUNITED, WANT NO PART OF HITMAKER NOSTALGIA AS THEY RECOVER THEIR 
STRAIGHT-AHEAD BLUES ROOTS.

 They were loud; they were dynamic; they were cartoony, and they were a hell of 
a lot of fun. The J. Geils Band, a concert and radio staple of the '70s and 
'80s, took blues, R&B and rock 'n' roll, mixed it vigorously with manic energy 
and showmanship, and came up with a winning formula. 
</P>
<P>
 "Freeze-Frame," "Centerfold," "Love Stinks," "Must of Got Lost" and "First I 
Look at the Purse" are among the group's most fondly remembered hits, but fewer 
recall the Geils Band's origins as a more straight-ahead blues group, perhaps 
best known at the time for its vivifying covers of tunes by Otis Rush, John Lee 
Hooker and Willie Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years after the band's breakup, two of its core members have reunited to 
form Magic Dick & Jay Geils Bluestime, a traditional blues and jump group that 
finds guitarist Geils and blues harpist Dick coming full circle, rediscovering 
the music that first inspired them to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounded out by rhythm guitarist Jerry Miller, bassist Michael Ward and drummer 
Steve Ramsay, Bluestime -- which plays tonight at Cantina La Vida in Brea -- is 
a far cry from even the earlier incarnations of the J. Geils Band, judging from 
the group's recently released, self-titled album on Boston's Rounder Records. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gone is the kinetic animation, the jivey charisma and rock 'n' roll attack 
that marked the Geils Band's style. Bluestime plays serious-minded, no-frills 
roots music, and wants no part of any nostalgia for the old hitmaking days. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing I want people to understand," Dick said in a recent interview, 
"is that the band is doing a combination of classic, Chicago-style blues and 
classic jazz. It's important to me that people understand this because when 
they come to the shows, I want them to know that they're not going to be 
hearing old J. Geils Band tunes." 
</P>
<P>
 In marked contrast to his erstwhile wildman stage persona, Dick spoke in 
thoughtful, measured tones, seemingly evaluating each word before he used it, 
elucidating a deep desire that the music of Bluestime not be misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very important to me. A lot of people, all they knew us for was 
'Freeze-Frame,' 'Centerfold' and stuff like that," said Dick, 49. "I don't 
think they were aware of how blues and R&B oriented the earlier stuff was. I 
really feel great about (the new group) because this is the music that inspired 
J. and myself when we first discovered our mutual interest in Chicago-style 
blues and classic jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never got to do enough of it in the J. Geils Band. We kind of went down 
the rock road -- which was fine, we had a great time with that, too. I 
thoroughly enjoyed it. But this is different, to be fronting a band which is 
very fundamental, and to play the music that was my first love." 
</P>
<P>
 Dick, born Richard Salwitz, grew up in Pittsfield, Mass., and was into rock 
and blues from the time he was a small child. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a brother four years older than me and he had all these rock 'n' roll 
records around the house, like Little Richard's first 78s," he recalled. "I 
wore those (records) out. I memorized every Lee Allen sax solo. I knew those 
solos by heart in my head even before I played an instrument, and they were 
probably a very big influence on me. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was also jazz stuff around the house, early Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie 
Parker and some Louis Armstrong. It wasn't until later on that I got exposed to 
Chicago-style blues, and that really clinched it all for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The J. Geils Blues Band -- later shortened to the J. Geils Band -- formed in 
1967 and soon was a staple of the Boston club scene. Signed to Atlantic Records 
in 1971, it became a popular touring attraction, aided by such prominent 
extollers as the Allman Brothers, who praised the Geils Band as their favorite, 
and legendary promoter/Fillmore owner Bill Graham who always would go out of 
his way to tout Geils and company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember closing the Fillmore East with the Allman Brothers," said Dick. 
"Bill was great. I miss him. He was a good thing for this business. He was a 
committed man, and he always did great things for the J. Geils Band. When we 
were first being introduced on the West Coast, I remember him saying to the 
audience that he was really proud to present this band, and if they didn't like 
the show he'd be glad to give them their money back. Nobody left, but he was 
the kind of guy who would always lay things on the line." 
</P>
<P>
 The Geils Band's rep was forged in no small part by the mind-boggling metier 
of Magic Dick who became known as a virtuoso musician, a harp player's harp 
player. Well versed in the classic blues styles of Little Walter, James Cotton 
and Sonny Boy Williamson, he also could play with a young rocker's speed and 
aggression, as best evidenced on his tour-de-force workout "Whammer Jammer." 
</P>
<P>
 In Bluestime, he returns to the vintage style of his mentors, and also serves 
as lead vocalist -- a role he serves more or less competently, albeit without 
the sheer excellence of his musicianship on the harp. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, those raised on the whiskey-throated, hep cat stylizations of J. Geils 
Band singer Peter Wolf may find themselves disappointed by Dick's more 
run-of-the-mill vocal talents. Still, it's to his credit that he avoids the 
offensive blackface posturing of many white blues singers, and he seems proud 
of his achievements as a relatively new singer, lustily defending his methods 
and determined to explain his vision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel compelled to say that there's a number of things that people have 
ideas of -- as singers or as listeners, and I'm addressing this to both -- that 
are somewhat askew from my own. The point I want to get across is that my 
singing is honest. I sing in my own voice. I don't put on a different mask for 
each tune or type of song, as some singers do. Some singers mimic to a high 
degree. To me, that's not what blues singing is all about. I don't employ 
certain sound devices, like gravel, which for me would be fake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Singing is really challenging to me because I've only been doing it for a 
couple of years now. Singing night after night, you really have to change your 
lifestyle in order to keep that voice working properly. But the desire to sing 
is something that lay dormant in me for a long time, and I'm really enjoying 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Having taken most of the last 10 years off from performing (he spent the time 
developing a number of new, patented harp tunings along with partner, Pierre 
Beauregard), Dick expressed unreserved joy at being back on the road, 
performing the music he loves most. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to take this all the way around the world. The blues is a very 
popular thing, and one of the most influential musics in the world. It just 
feels great to be doing this now." 
</P>
<P>
 * Magic Dick & Jay Geils Bluestime plays tonight at 8 at Cantina La Vida, 6105 
Carbon Canyon Road, Brea. $15.00. (714) 996-0720.

RAP RESPONSIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To Andre Young (Dr. Dre) and O'Shea Jackson (Ice Cube): You should be ashamed 
of yourselves for putting out "Natural Born Killaz" ("Is America Ready for 
'Natural Born Killaz'?," Oct. 20). Are you both so bereft of feeling for your 
fellow man that you don't care how much additional pain your record causes the 
families of Nicole Brown Simpson, Ronald Goldman and Sharon Tate -- to say 
nothing of the deleterious effects it has on our already too violent society? 
Are your lives so money oriented that you so flippantly shirk your 
responsibilities as creative people? 
</P>
<P>
 You think that through your raps you "uncover" and "report" the problems of 
the inner city, gang warfare, violence, etc. But, in reality, you add to the 
problem. Instead of constructively developing solutions to the complex problems 
in our society that we all face, you offer no suggestions. You only exacerbate 
a bad situation. 
</P>
<P>
 It's bad enough that you are a negative influence on society. You also hurt 
the innocent victims of these atrocious crimes. Should they have to suffer any 
more than they already have or will (through long drawn out trials)? You hurt 
the young adults who listen to your records. I can only imagine the inner 
hatred you must feel about yourselves.

LET KIRK STICK AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re Dale Griner's anti-Kirk Saturday Letter ("Let Kirk Be Gone," Oct. 15): The 
new "Star Trek" film "Generations" was re-shot to include more footage of Capt. 
Kirk in response to test audiences' strong indication that Kirk is the 
character they wanted to see. 
</P>
<P>
 Griner's letter notwithstanding, true "Star Trek" fans want to see more of 
Kirk, not less.And, with William Shatner getting on in years, it is only a 
matter of time before the top brass at Paramount reintroduce the characters of 
Kirk, Spock et al. played by younger actors in the new "Star Trek: The Early 
Voyages." 
</P>
<P>
 Only the original "Star Trek" and the second film were truly good. "Star Trek: 
The Next Generation" and "Deep Space Nine" are cheesy, New-Agey bland copies of 
the original. The writing, the sets and costumes, even the guest starlets, had 
a whole lot more entertainment value than do the lame modern shows with their 
huge budgets. The original "Star Trek" didn't take itself so seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Just look at the cast for the new "Star Trek" series "Voyager." They look like 
a bunch of geeks. There is no more visceral energy or wit or sex to "Star 
Trek." Trekkies, oh yes, Trekkers, have squeezed the thing they love so tight 
that they've strangled the life right out of it.

NEWS FREAK NO MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Howard Rosenberg's column, " 'NewsHour' Chases the News, Not Simpson" (Oct. 
26), was right on. As a former news freak, I used to watch several hours of 
local news a day -- but no more! To get the small amount of news dispensed 
between the mountains of idiotic, ridiculous hype on the Rodney G. King 
beating, the Menendez trial and now the O.J. Simpson trial is simply not worth 
the aggravation. Give me "MacNeil/Lehrer" or CNN any time.

'STAR TREK' ALUM DIRECTS UPDATED 'WAR OF THE WORLDS'; RADIO: JOHN DE LANCIE'S 
PRODUCTION OF THE ORIGINAL SCRIPT WILL BE BROADCAST THE NIGHT BEFORE HALLOWEEN. 
THE CAST INCLUDES OTHER 'STAR TREK' CAST MEMBERS. 
</P>

 In 1938, more families had radios than telephones, automobiles, plumbing, 
newspapers and magazines. Radio was the medium that informed, entertained and 
united people in an era of uncertainty over threats of war, fascism, communism 
and prolonged unemployment. It was a time when people strongly believed 
anything could happen -- and on the night before Halloween, anything did. 
</P>
<P>
 Orson Welles and a group of actors from the Mercury Theatre, armed with a 
script by Howard Koch, presented an adaptation of H. G. Wells' novel, "War of 
the Worlds." The radio play, presented in the form of a live newscast, became 
known as the panic broadcast. It caused mass hysteria around the country 
because many listeners who tuned in late thought they were hearing actual news 
reports about aliens landing in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as large as a bear and glistens like wet leather," said Welles as the 
announcer. "But that face. It . . . it's indescribable. I can hardly force 
myself to look at it. The eyes are black and gleam like a serpent. The mouth is 
V-shaped with saliva dripping from its rimless lips that seem to quiver and 
pulsate." 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-six years later, radio is hardly the dominant medium anymore, but John 
de Lancie, who played Q on "Star Trek: The Next Generation," believes there's 
still a message to be found in "War of the Worlds." He has directed a new 
production of Koch's script that, like the original, will air the night before 
Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be followed by a short sequel, "When Worlds Collide," written by De 
Lancie and Nat Segaloff, that comments on the current media environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We invite you to listen again to an old chestnut and see if you can glimpse 
the significance, and then let us take you one step further," offered De 
Lancie, who cast the play with fellow "Star Trek" alumni. Among the actors 
joining him will be Leonard Nimoy from the original series and, from the "Next 
Generation" spinoff, Gates McFadden (Dr. Beverly Crusher), Wil Wheaton (Wesley 
Crusher) and Brent Spiner (Data). 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to put together a group of actors like this to do sci-fi, and 
there's something about the 'Star Trek' actors that has a crowd-pleasing 
quality to it," he said. "This group has the birthright to do sci-fi; they are 
the bearers of sci-fi." 
</P>
<P>
 The production, part of L.A. Theatre Works' "The Play's the Thing" series, was 
taped during a live performance at the Guest Quarters Suite Hotel in Santa 
Monica earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'War of the Worlds" was a goof delivered as news bulletins," De Lancie said. 
"It was the beginning of an erosion that now has us in trouble. We just don't 
know where to get the truth. It was a piece made 56 years ago with all good 
intentions that still abused the public's trust. It was that little marble, 
that little push, and now no one trusts the media." 
</P>
<P>
 The "War of the Worlds" project has been a refreshing change for Nimoy, who 
has spent the past nine years directing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really like settling into a nice, warm, comfortable bath," Nimoy said. 
"I find myself really enjoying hanging around with the actors telling actors' 
stories -- you know, like actors do before a performance. It's something that I 
haven't been able to do for a while. It's been a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Nimoy believes the possibility of extraterrestrial life is very real, and that 
it is just a matter of time before we might be contacted, or we contact them . 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very likely," he said. "I happen to be a believer. You know, I'm 
one of those that quotes from the numerical odds: There are so many thousands 
of suns like ours and so many thousands of planets orbiting around those suns, 
as we do around our sun, that I think it's highly unlikely that there is not 
life out there that has evolved into a technological society. I believe that it 
has happened." 
</P>
<P>
 In the play, Nimoy portrays a scientist named Pierson who expresses that view: 
"Dim and wonderful is the vision I have conjured up in my mind of life 
spreading slowly from this little seed-bed of the solar system throughout the 
inanimate vastness of sidereal space. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 It is an idea De Lancie relishes. "Our world has us always here," he said. "We 
will be here from now 'til the end of time . . . maybe not! And that's the 
scary part!" 
</P>
<P>
 * "War of the Worlds" will be broadcast on KRCW-FM (89.9) at 6 p.m. Sunday. It 
also will be available on cassette for $19.95 from L.A. Theatre Works at (310) 
827-0808.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; KETCHUM'S LITERATE EARTHINESS AND CHARM WIN ADMIRERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The spangly, red leather jacket Hal Ketchum wore for the first part of his 
House of Blues show Thursday seemed a bit at odds with the literate earthiness 
of his songs. But the earnest enthusiasm with which he performed showed that 
even in the restrictive world of country music, you can have it both ways. 
</P>
<P>
 On one hand, Ketchum -- blessed with the looks of a soap opera hunk -- played 
up that image, tossing his shoulder-length hair, putting his arms straight out 
to the side between guitar strums and basking in the screams from smitten 
female fans. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other, he brought out the full depth and resonance of his songs, which 
fall largely in the Texas songwriter tradition of Guy Clark, Jimmy Dale Gilmore 
et al. Both his rich tenor and his four-piece band showed more force than on 
his three albums.  
</P>
<P>
 As a writer he tends at times to cover well-trod country turf (rural 
nostalgia, lovers' faith), but there's a freshness to his approach, even when 
it harks back to the '70s country-rock of Poco. It doesn't hurt that, at 41, 
this Upstate New York native is old for a newcomer -- he's actually lived some 
of the life he sings about. 
</P>
<P>
 At his best Thursday, he simultaneously evoked the smarts of Lyle Lovett (they 
have similar voices and deliveries) and the regular-guy affectlessness of Garth 
Brooks. Add to it those good looks and you've got a combination that even a 
country Dr. Frankenstein would be hard-pressed to devise. STEVE HOCHMAN

ROCKIN' DAD BOB SEGER KEEPS PRIORITIES IN LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK CRISAFULLI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a reason rock fans have heard more of Bob Seger in TV commercials in 
recent years than from the stage. "I'm a first-time dad," crows the 49-year-old 
singer, "and I'm practicing active fatherhood six to eight hours a day. Plus 
night shifts. Plus weekends." 
</P>
<P>
 With a 22-month-old son and another child due in April, Seger doesn't mind 
having some time on his hands these days. He made the decision to slow down his 
music-making five years ago when he married his current wife, Nita. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I wanted to do it right this time," he says, chuckling. "And it's 
working out great. I'm spending a lot of time with family. We actually have 
holidays now, and that never happened when we were on the road during our major 
surge."  
</P>
<P>
 Seger's surge had him putting out nine consecutive million-selling albums 
between 1975 and 1991, and at his peak he and his Silver Bullet Band were 
playing 250 nights a year before he stopped touring in '87. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pace we set for ourselves was astounding, and I'm amazed we lived through 
it," he says. "And I feel like I'm a very fortunate guy -- the radio still 
plays us a lot and people remember the songs. I can take solace in that I put 
down some stuff that had some staying power. Beyond that, I don't question my 
success too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Seger began recording material for a new album earlier this year, but took a 
break in order to put together his first-ever greatest hits album, which came 
out last Tuesday. Along with such classics as "Night Moves" and "Mainstreet," 
the 14-song collection features two previously unreleased tracks -- a version 
of Chuck Berry's "C'est la Vie" recorded as a warm-up for the "Fire Inside" 
sessions, and "In Your Time," a new song Seger wrote for his son, Cole. 
</P>
<P>
 An album of new material will be ready early next year, and by next fall the 
Silver Bullet Band may be back on the road again.  
</P>
<P>
 "We'll see how things go in April with the new baby, but I'm starting to get 
the itch to play again," he says. "I may just get a bus and take the whole 
family on the road with me." 
</P>
<P>
 The rock 'n' roll family man hopes to be able to take care of his fans and his 
kids equally well, but he's got his priorities straight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still as much fun as it ever was for me to play, but it's a question of 
balance. The difficult thing about being a parent is that if you have a career, 
you have to balance your ambitions with the family. If you can make that 
balance and still do quality work, you're OK. But if there comes a time when I 
can't do both -- if it's just too overwhelming -- then I'll just be a dad."

POP MUSIC REVIEW; AN UNINHIBITED SOUL COUGHING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 New York's Soul Coughing straddles the lines between rap, jazz, funk and even 
techno to create a danceable mix topped with skewed social commentary. But in 
its quest to fuse all these elements with cleverness, the quartet -- whose 
recent debut album has stirred up a lot of interest in the alternative rock 
world -- often comes off smarmy and condescending. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday at LunaPark the band showed far more natural flair, thanks to singer 
Michael Doughty's charmingly oddball presence and the band's uninhibited 
performance. Doughty ranted, recited and deadpanned lyrics in deep, craggy 
tones with a sharp biting edge.  
</P>
<P>
 His animated moves -- from swaying back and forth as if on a rocking boat, to 
slow-motion arm movements like a rapper on Thorazine -- brought the words and 
music to life. He sang of his love for bottled water, about a man mesmerized by 
the Bac-o-bits at a salad bar and even offered a long, spoken-word tale of L.A. 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 The band, complete with stand-up bass, keyboard, drums and Doughty on 
occasional guitar, struck consistently strong, motivating grooves. Sporadic 
samples skittered in and out of some numbers, while the band's messy parody of 
free jazz was hilarious in its intentional confusion. Hopefully, Soul Coughing 
will be able to capture that quirky charisma on its next album. LORRAINE ALI

FAMILY; SERENDIPITY BOUNCES BACK WITH 'QUIMBY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Financial considerations forced the Serendipity Theatre Company to leave the 
Coronet Theatre in Los Angeles this summer, after four years of children's 
theater there as a resident Equity company. 
</P>
<P>
 Down, but not out, Serendipity has bounced back as a touring company, kicking 
off an ambitious 1994-95 season with an engaging production of "Ramona Quimby" 
at the Hermosa Civic Theatre and UCLA's Freud Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on one of children's literature's most endearing characters -- the 
spunky, outspoken, irrepressible heroine created by author Beverly Cleary -- 
the deft stage adaptation by Len Jenkins is economy-sized but a lively success 
nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 New third-grader Ramona has a lot to cope with: her big sister Beezus (Marisa 
Zuckerman), a strict teacher (Annalisa Erickson), the imminent departure of a 
favorite aunt (Erickson again), and baby-sitter Mrs. Kemp (Caryn Ronis), who 
watches soap operas all afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst of all, Dad (Sam Kuglen) has lost his job and started smoking again, Mom 
(Laurie Lapinski) has gone to work, and economizing measures mean no more 
dinners at Whopper Burger. 
</P>
<P>
 The modest production features a flimsy-looking set of smaller-than-life 
building cut-outs, and lighting was erratic in Hermosa over the weekend, but 
director Katy Realista's even pacing, the script's genuine humor and Ramona's 
unsappy, real-life quandaries, plus an agreeable mix of adult professionals and 
child actors, make the show a worthwhile family excursion. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlight, however, is the amusing, dark-haired little dynamo in the title 
role. As Ramona, Lynsey Bartilson is remarkably at ease on stage, with a knack 
for comedy and character. 
</P>
<P>
 Upcoming Serendipity shows are a reprise of its holiday "Snow Child," a 
musical "Black Beauty," "Island of the Blue Dolphins" and "The Velveteen 
Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Ramona Quimby," UCLA, Freud Playhouse, Westwood, today, 2 p.m.; Sunday, 1 
and 4 p.m. $12 per adult; $6 per child, age 13 and under. Not recommended for 
under age 5. (310) 825-2101.

YOU WON'T BE SEEING THESE IN THE FRIENDLY SKIES; MOVIES: AIRLINES ROUTINELY 
EDIT (CENSOR) FILMS THAT HAVE 'ANYTHING TO DO WITH PLANES EXPLODING OR CATCHING 
FIRE.' THAT'S WHY SOME POPULAR WORKS NEVER SEE THE FUZZY FLICKER OF THE 
IN-FLIGHT SCREEN. 
</P>

<P>
 At least a few viewers of the action hit "Speed" are being denied a big 
payoff: seeing the film's climactic explosion between the runaway bus and a 
cargo plane being towed on a runway at LAX. 
</P>
<P>
 The film, which is being shown on American Airlines' current transcontinental 
in-flight movie from Los Angeles to New York, now skips confusingly from a shot 
of the bus careening as it speeds down the runway to what seems to be an 
instantaneous fireball -- with no plane in sight.  
</P>
<P>
 "We always edit out anything to do with planes exploding or catching fire, 
whether they're on the ground or in the air," says Joni Herman, American's 
analyst for in-flight entertainment, who was responsible for the cut. "Consider 
that some passengers have a terrible fear of flying and they're stuck on this 
flight for 5 1/2 hours. The last thing they want to see is a plane explode and 
think about it for the remainder of the trip." 
</P>
<P>
 That's why other movies, like "Passenger 57," "Airport" and "Fearless" -- last 
summer's movie about the aftermath of surviving a plane crash -- never saw the 
fuzzy flicker of the in-flight screen. 
</P>
<P>
 And why a current film may find itself omitted from in-flight viewing 
altogether. "Love Affair," starring Warren Beatty and Annette Bening, features 
an emergency plane landing onto a South Pacific island. "Emergency landings 
aren't usually a problem," adds Herman. "But I haven't seen the film yet to 
make that call." 
</P>
<P>
 Other scenes not involving plane crashes have been trimmed. In 1988's "Rain 
Man," Dustin Hoffman's character, the autistic savant Raymond, rattles off 
Qantas Airlines' no-crash record as he and his brother prepare to take a plane 
flight. But that little speech was nowhere to be heard on the in-flight 
version. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any reference to any other airline is always cut," says Herman. "All the 
airlines do it." 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what's funny about these arbitrary cuts?" muses "Speed" producer 
Mark Gordon. "Do you suppose the (airline personnel) ever ask themselves, how 
many people saw the movie before? Odds are, a good percentage have. In the case 
of 'Speed,' (the airline passengers) missed one of the biggest and best action 
sequences in the film. So I guess the audience was just left figuring, geez I 
guess the bus must have crashed into . . . something."

MUSIC REVIEW; HERMAN'S 'SCARLET LETTER' PREMIERES IN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to daring operatic ventures in the Southland, it seems that all 
roads lead to Long Beach, whose small-but-tough opera company is known for 
adventurous pluck. 
</P>
<P>
 The operatic muse was in town again Thursday night as Martin Herman's "The 
Scarlet Letter" had its world premiere in the Carpenter Center at Cal State 
Long Beach. The production is an impressive in-house effort by the Opera 
Ensemble of CSLB with generous outside help. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from some opening-night glitches (the brief run concludes Sunday 
afternoon), the performance left a strong, clear impression. Most important, it 
signified that all-too-rare occurrence on the current musical scene: a premiere 
of a fully realized new opera. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathaniel Hawthorne's pre-modern, proto-feminist tale of social hypocrisy, 
individualism versus the wheels of injustice, and feminine prowess makes for a 
ripe operatic vehicle, a fact well-understood by librettist Thomas F. Curley. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of musical language, Herman veers in multiple directions, leaning on 
Berg-like atonality during tense passages and post-romantic Strauss-isms during 
more tender moments. The finale is jarringly cloying as our heroine pronounces, 
axiomatically, "Be true, be true" into the moonset. 
</P>
<P>
 This pluralistic tack works well for the most part, creating an amalgam that 
gives the work a bold and post-modern character, but it sometimes leads to a 
confused context. The alternately somber and quietly heroic nature of the 
narrative doesn't always hold up under shifting stylistic ploys. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong vocal cast included a luminous Tracy Strand as scarlet-garbed Hester 
Prynne, Eli Villanueva as the duplicitous Chillingworth, and Music Center Opera 
denizens Greg Fedderly and Jonathan Mack in fine form. Brent McMunn, director 
of the opera program at CSLB, conducted a smallish orchestra for maximum 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Stage director Philip Littell, whose recent claim to questionable fame was as 
the librettist for the recent production of "The Dangerous Liaisons" in San 
Francisco, lightly disperses the action across economical sets by Chontelle 
Gray. She paints a fine, visually poetic scene by deploying projections, 
scrims, cut-outs and spartan props. 
</P>
<P>
 On this night, there was skill and grand operatic ambition aplenty in Long 
Beach. JOSEF WOODARD

MUSIC REVIEW; AUDUBON QUARTET KICKS OFF GUILD SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles being still a relative yearling as cities go, time takes on a 
qualified value. When an arts organization can boast a 50th anniversary, as the 
Music Guild is doing this season, there is cause for sounded trumpets. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber music series, which started operations at the Wilshire-Ebell 
Theater in 1944, began its semi-centennial season there Wednesday with a mostly 
solid performance by the Audubon String Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
 For some unknown reason, a bagpiper commenced the evening with a Celtic 
processional in the aisles and onstage. Given the festive circumstances, 
however, the seeming irrelevancies could be excused. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the official performance, the quartet began a bit roughly with 
Beethoven's String Quartet in E major, Opus 127, with ragged intonational edges 
and uneven ensemble weave. But they hit an impressive stride on Samuel Barber's 
String Quartet, Opus 11. 
</P>
<P>
 An agreeable, mercurial mode of romanticism marks Barber's first movement, but 
the piece will always be known for its elegiac slow section, later orchestrated 
and immortalized as the popular Adagio for Strings. Despite the theme's 
potential overfamiliarity, when played with the degree of focus and controlled 
intensity heard here, it remains one of the most touching and saddest tunes in 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
 For the concert's second half, pianist Mona Golabek joined in on an assured 
reading of Schumann's Piano Quintet in E major, Opus 44. Highlighted by an 
effectively funereal slow movement and a torrentially scalar Scherzo, it 
provided the evening an aptly triumphant finale. JOSEF WOODARD

JAZZ REVIEW; KLON'S JAZZ WEST COAST STARTS OFF UPBEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The opening day of KLON's Jazz West Coast celebration was a rousing success, 
both commercially and artistically. From the initial 9 a.m. panel discussion of 
the historic era of Central Avenue jazz to the final, exuberant, near-midnight 
notes of the Stan Kenton alumni orchestra, the venues were full, the audiences 
were enthusiastic and the musicians were clearly having a ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14 hours of events provided a colorful first act for the balance of the 
four-day festival, which takes place at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza Hotel and 
the Performing Arts Center in Redondo Beach. Tenor saxophonist Teddy Edwards, 
one of the under-appreciated jazz treasures of Los Angeles, kicked off the 
musical programming at lunch time with a taste of the kind of energetic, 
straight-ahead playing that often was overlooked in the popularized, '50s 
vision of cool West Coast jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 A midafternoon concert featuring Buddy Collette, Al Aarons, Gerald Wiggins and 
Ernie Andrews continued the theme. In addition to a progression of interactive, 
can-you-top-this soloing from the instrumentalists, the group also showcased 
Andrews' lovely, time-remembered reading of "If I Love You" and a celebratory 
"All Blues." 
</P>
<P>
 In between performances, jazz historian/archivist Mark Cantor screened some of 
his films, and other panels examined subjects such as be-bop on the West Coast, 
jazz in the '40s and the Stan Kenton innovations orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's major event, an evening concert presenting the Candoli Brothers 
Quintet and the Kenton alumni (performing works from his Innovations in Modern 
Music period), drew an overflow crowd that swelled the capacity of the Grand 
Ballroom from 750 to nearly 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Candolis were, as always, entertaining and lighthearted. Conte is the 
superior jazz player, but elder brother Pete's counter-soloing -- spirited and 
uncomplicated -- persistently demanded attention on its own terms. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was a disappointment in the evening's proceedings, it was the failure 
of the Kenton alumni orchestra, complete with string section, to produce a 
full-length rendering of Bob Graettinger's dissonant "City of Glass." 
(Insufficient rehearsal time was blamed.) But the sumptuous sound of the 
massive arrangements -- mostly by Bill Russo, Pete Rugolo (who conducted his 
own pieces) and Shorty Rogers (prevented from attending by illness) -- was 
ample compensation. Soloing by trombonist Slyde Hyde and alto saxophonists Gabe 
Baltazar and Bud Shank was excellent, with Baltazar, in particular, sounding in 
top form. 
</P>
<P>
 At the program's close, producer Ken Poston, prowling the Grand Ballroom with 
a beaming smile on his face, said, "I knew we had something, but I didn't know 
it would be this good. This thing has done so well that we actually started 
making a profit earlier this week. Who says jazz isn't alive and well?" 
</P>
<P>
 * Jazz West Coast tonight and tomorrow at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, 300 N. 
Harbor Drive, Redondo Beach, and the Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center, 320 
Knob Hill Redondo Beach. Some tickets available for individual events at prices 
ranging from $8 to $50. Information (310) 985-5566 or (310) 985-7000.

TV REVIEW; 'DANDELION DEAD': A WINNING MASTERPIECE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Masterpiece Theatre," which had recently appeared to lose its touch, has 
happily regained its winning form with the captivating British murder story 
"Dandelion Dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Redolent of the traditional style and tone that "Masterpiece" addicts will 
relish, the celebrated 1921 true story of a wife's murder by her solicitor 
husband is full of rich atmosphere, ripe characters and black humor. 
</P>
<P>
 You think O.J. Simpson is big? This case was huge in British legal history. 
Set in the cozy town of Hay-on-Wye on the scenic English-Welsh border, and shot 
there as well, the production should attract anyone who's ever fantasized about 
killing a spouse, a business rival or the wretched dandelions encroaching on 
their front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Those three harrowing problems and the potential for arsenic to solve all 
three are what prompt quiet solicitor Herbert Armstrong (the wonderful Michael 
Kitchen) to affect a Jekyll-and-Hyde-like transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 Portraying a proper pillar of the community and father of three children 
trapped in a loathsome marriage to an unstable, domineering wife (the curdling 
Sarah Miles), Kitchen deliciously reinvents the classic, henpecked husband. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to Kitchen's underplayed achievement is in his eyes, so full of 
deference and the quick, limp smiles of a man who's always a gentleman -- even 
going to the gallows with his spats on. 
</P>
<P>
 Writer Michael Chaplin and director Mike Hodges expand beyond a tale of 
murder. The movie's real accomplishment is in catching the fabric of a whole 
town, almost in the manner of a Victorian novel. 
</P>
<P>
 This patch of England is emblematic of a country reeling from the loss of a 
whole generation of young men in the aftermath of World War I. It's also a 
postcard picture of deceptive tranquillity -- of steam trains, lazy fields and 
quaint bridges, of mirthful Christmas dinners, brotherly Masonic Lodge rituals 
and family gatherings around the photo album and piano. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, those cursed dandelions fester like weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Dandelion Dead" airs this Sunday and the following Sunday in 90-minute 
installments, at 9 p.m. on KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV Channel 15, and at 8 
p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24. It also airs Tuesday at 8 p.m. on KOCE-TV Channel

FOLK LURE; HANDMADE CRAFTS FROM MEXICO AND CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA ARE 
POPULAR FOR THEIR BEAUTY AND PRACTICALITY. THEY MAKE THEMSELVES RIGHT AT HOME 
IN ORANGE COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Fanciful animals in teal, red and yellow take on myriad shapes and forms. Tin 
boxes sparkle. Blown glass catches the light. Carved wooden figures, earthen 
pottery and colorful weaves all speak of cultures close to the land. 
</P>
<P>
 The folk art of Mexico, Central and South America is increasingly finding a 
place of prominence in homes, offices and galleries in Orange County and 
throughout the United States. The growing interest reflects the increased 
connection between the cultures and a broad resurgence of appreciation for 
native arts and crafts. 
</P>
<P>
 This art defies easy categorization. The designs are often particular to a 
specific region; some pieces carry the imprint of outside influences, ancient 
and modern. Commerce has entered the fray too. With increasing demand, families 
and sometimes entire villages devote themselves to designing and producing 
specific styles of hand-crafted folk art. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing a tremendous increase in the popularity of Mexican, Central and 
South American art," says Carol McDonough, an interior designer and owner of 
EtCetera, an Anaheim Hills-based gallery and shop that specializes in imported 
items. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's great about Mexican and South American arts and crafts is that there 
is such diversity. Even if you don't like a particular style from one area, 
there's bound to be something else that catches your interest. And the work 
comes in all price ranges. We have customers who are living in million-dollar 
Spanish-style homes, and they adore the little $10 pieces of pottery. It's that 
sense of vibrancy and history that they are after." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the folk art has a practical side as well as an artistic one -- there 
are bowls, boxes, blankets and musical instruments as well as sculptural 
objects. Some pieces are religious, some political, some just playful. Media 
include wood, clay, paper, cloth, tin and iron. 
</P>
<P>
 Many pieces are tied to holiday celebrations, such as El Dia de los Muertos 
(Day of the Dead) and Navidad (Christmas).  
</P>
<P>
 Here's a look at some of the Latin folk art styles available in Orange County: 
Day of the Dead  
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, death is seen as part of life, and the dead are never forgotten. It 
is believed they return each year to be with the living. 
</P>
<P>
 El Dia de los Muertos artwork typically features skeletons, tiny coffins and 
tableaux of skeletons in everyday settings: wedding couples, soccer players, 
bar patrons, movie watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is believed that the spirits of those who have died return on Nov. 1 each 
year and depart on Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Offerings of food and drink are given, and candles and incense burners are 
lit. Flowers are also used. Strong scents are encouraged because it is believed 
that the dead take the aroma with them. 
</P>
<P>
 According to gallery owners who carry Day of the Dead art, there is a growing 
appreciation and understanding in this country of this work. Arpilleras  
</P>
<P>
 Although much artwork from Mexico and Central and South America is spiritual, 
some is political in nature, such as the arpilleras of Chile. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sue Fenwick, one of the managers of Third World Handarts in 
Orange, a nonprofit organization that sells the art of cooperatives throughout 
the world, the arpilleras tell the story of village life in Chile as well as 
political turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 "About the 1973 coup of General Pinochet, people who wereconsidered threats 
were taken and 'detained.' There would be no record of their disappearance and 
no help provided to their families in locating them." 
</P>
<P>
 The village women began stitching scenes of abductions, beatings and police 
brutality in their arpilleras, the Spanish word for the burlap that serves as 
the backing for these works. 
</P>
<P>
 The pieces often feature soft, doll-like people appliqued onto a background of 
village life and scenes include farming, sporting events and schoolyards. 
Oaxacan Figures  
</P>
<P>
 Rapidly gaining in popularity, these imaginative creatures are identified with 
the Mexican state of Oaxaca, where they are made. The carved wood figures are 
brightly painted, often playful animal images. Sometimes the figures combine 
parts from different animals, such as a zebra body with a lion's head and 
dragon's tail.  
</P>
<P>
 "Oaxacan animals started being heavily marketed about 10 years ago," says Jane 
McCauley, an interior designer and art collector. "Now they are a big 
collectible. 
</P>
<P>
 "The villagers call the figures 'magic in the trees.' They are carved from 
tree branches, and they take on different forms. The men usually carve the 
pieces, while the women paint them. They started out simply, but now they're 
more fanciful." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the figures are small, however, says Mal Miele, owner of Galleria del 
Sol in Fullerton, which specializes in ethnic art. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some were used in parades where someone would step into the body. For 
instance, we have a mermaid body that someone would step in and then pull up 
around his or her waist so the legs stick out and you can walk. When you walk, 
the fins flap. I think the artists must have a lot of fun designing these. It 
makes it so parade participants look like a walking float!" Pottery  
</P>
<P>
 Pottery is a frequent fixture of Mexican art. Pulque pots (pulque is a liquor 
fermented from cactus) are used to hold flowers or water or as a decorative 
element on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a humble pot, it's very well known," McDonough said. "Everywhere you 
travel in Mexico, you'll find pottery -- pots in kitchens, on porches, many 
with practical purposes as well." 
</P>
<P>
 McCauley said Mexico's Puebla area is renowned for its pottery, although 
"others also create very fine pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 A chiminea , or Mexican oven, although it was designed strictly for 
utilitarian purposes, is also becoming popular in decorating schemes. It is 
usually made of bricks and has a grill on top. Southern Californians are 
charmed by its rustic appeal, according to McDonough. 
</P>
<P>
 Clay statuary and folk art decorations are produced throughout Mexico, even in 
the poorest villages. Even in the homes of the poor, there is bound to be some 
form of statuary. 
</P>
<P>
 A frequent clay figure is the arbol de vida, or "tree of life." Often depicted 
with Adam and Eve figures alongside it, the tree is usually brightly painted 
and sometimes features a snake as well as birds and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can often determine where a piece of pottery was created by the color of 
the clay," McCauley said. "Clay changes from region to region. The Puebla 
region has the reddish clay while pieces from Oaxaca are molded from black 
clay." Molas  
</P>
<P>
 Molas are panels of cloth with extremely fine, precise stitches that are 
appliqued by the women of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
 "By selling these fine pieces of stitchery, the women are able to improve 
their families' standard of living," Fenwick said. "In fact, many of them go 
right up to the cruise ships that come through Panama, selling their wares." 
</P>
<P>
 One needs to look closely at a mola to truly appreciate its beauty. What may 
appear as a solid line is, in fact, an impossibly tiny chain of precisely 
crocheted stitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a very beautiful and painstaking art form," Fenwick said. 
"Finally, it's beginning to be appreciated." Ironwork  
</P>
<P>
 Influenced by the Spanish, black wrought iron is used to create everything 
from furniture to candelabra. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until recently, Mexican wrought iron always seemed to have lots of 
curlicues," McCauley said. "Now the artists are using nature as more of a 
guide. We are seeing pieces where branch formations and more flowing designs 
are being used. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mexicans are known for their durable and beautiful iron work, and 
sometimes you will find a French influence such as a bench with a shell design. 
We also see Aztec influences every once in awhile, such as a sun god motif." 
Papier-mache 
</P>
<P>
 Papier-mache is used to create brightly colored bowls and platters of varying 
designs and patterns as well as toys and figurines. 
</P>
<P>
 It is often employed in creating animals, masks, skeletons and devils used in 
Day of the Dead ceremonies.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at some of the figures, you'll see that they are using animal 
whiskers for hair or using dried beans or whatever else is around," McCauley 
said. "The artists are very resourceful, and they use what's at hand." Tin  
</P>
<P>
 Because it is lightweight and flexible, tin is often used to create mirrors, 
boxes and a variety of ornaments. The tin is cut in long, thin sheets and then 
painted with translucent colors. Typical subjects include sunbursts, tropical 
birds, angels, trees, animals and musical instruments. Retablos are pieces of 
tin that have been painted on and usually feature saints or other religious 
icons. Gourds  
</P>
<P>
 Gourds are frequently used to fashion boxes, bowls, rattles and other 
functional items. Many have designs carved around the exterior to enhance their 
beauty. Musical Toys  
</P>
<P>
 Clay whistles, clay flutes (usually from the Peruvian Andes), brightly painted 
maracas, clay bells and wind chimes have all become popular collectibles. 
Created by hand and painted, these pieces are often admired as much for their 
appearance as they are for the music they create. Glass  
</P>
<P>
 The Guadalajara, Mexico, area is particularly known for its exquisite 
hand-blown glass. Vases, pitchers and glasses are hand-blown, and the rims are 
frequently ringed with a deep cobalt blue or green. Nascimientos 
</P>
<P>
 Nativity scenes frequently are designed to resemble the people who built them. 
That's why a nativity set from Peru on sale at Third World Handarts in Orange 
features the Virgin Mary with a long single braid, a style typical of the young 
mothers of that region. 
</P>
<P>
 Most nascimientos are hand- carved and -painted using local woods or 
materials. Frequently, they are fashioned out of clay or papier-mache . Santos 
</P>
<P>
 Often created in Guatemala, santos are carved depictions of the saints. The 
tradition of carving the figures is often handed down through the generations, 
so you frequently find families with a reputation as santeros, or saint 
carvers. These works, starting at $40, are carved in wood and hand-painted. 
Crosses  
</P>
<P>
 Crosses are another important artwork and come in various styles and price 
ranges. Sometimes they are affixed with milagros, or miracles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes if there is something wrong, such as a bad foot or broken bone, the 
person will pray to a particular saint to heal them," Miele said. "When they 
are healed, they will affix a tiny metal foot, hand or whatever to the cross as 
a token of thanks." Masks  
</P>
<P>
 Frequently used for fiestas and ceremonial celebrations, masks are used in 
dances to tell stories or in theatrical productions. Many of the masks from 
Mexico and its southern neighbors are made of wood, papier-mache , cloth and 
gourds. They often feature symbolic creatures from the animal world. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I go looking for masks, I sniff them to see if they smell smoky," Miele 
said. "If they do, then chances are they've actually been used at a ceremony, 
and that makes it more valuable to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Miele says he is delighted by the masks, which can become very elaborate, such 
as one that depicts butterflies and another enhanced with copper. Where to Find

A HELPING HAND: INSIDE & OUT; STUDS CARRY PLENTY OF WEIGHT WITH WALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. I'm planning on installing some heavy-duty bookshelves along one wall in my 
den. Because of the weight involved, should I try to attach them to the studs 
or will some of the other types of wall anchors be just as effective? 
</P>
<P>
 P.I., Dana Point 
</P>
<P>
 A. Attaching a heavy object to a stud is always the best way to secure it to a 
wall, says Frank Eckert of Arrow True Value Hardware in Orange. However, stud 
location and bracket location don't always coincide. A butterfly toggle bolt 
also works very well in this situation, but it is a little messy in that you 
need to make a big hole in the wall for it to fit through. Plastic or metal 
anchors aren't always reliable. If you're overzealous and tighten them down too 
far, you may end up spinning them in the hole, and they may not collapse and 
lock into the wall. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q. We live in a typical '70s two-story tract home that's fine for our family, 
except that it's annoying to hear people walking around upstairs while you're 
downstairs. We're thinking about re-carpeting soon, and we were wondering if 
putting insulation under the subfloor upstairs will cut down on the noise.  
</P>
<P>
 S.S., Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
 A. You're talking about a major construction job, but if you go ahead with it, 
you'll probably notice a difference, says Pete Gorman of Rancho Lumber in 
Westminster. There's a rigid foam insulation that also has sound-deadening 
qualities. Pulling the floor apart may take a long time, and the foam will have 
to be cut around where your floor joists have been cross-blocked, so not every 
square inch will be insulated because not all of it will be accessible.  
</P>
<P>
 As an alternative, you could build a false ceiling with Sheetrock to create an 
insulating air gap downstairs. If you're mainly bothered by the noise in the 
downstairs den or living room, the new ceiling could be put up just in these 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I have PVC vertical blinds in three windows that continually stick when I 
try to pull them back. Is there some type of device that can be used to keep 
them from sticking? 
</P>
<P>
 R.M., Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 A. Many people try to draw blinds open when the slats are closed, which can 
cause this problem, says Leslie Cooper of Bob's Shades & Linoleum in Orange. 
Using the chain or wand, make sure the slats are completely open before you 
draw the blinds. They can get easily jumbled if they're not in position, which 
causes problems later when you want them to open or * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Does my central air conditioner use Freon? Does it have to be re-charged 
like my car's unit does, and will I have to replace the Freon because of 
environmental regulations? 
</P>
<P>
 G.Y., Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 A. Your air conditioner does use Freon, says Ray Bakshi of RSSA Plumbing & 
Heating in Anaheim. However, as long as your unit is checked regularly, you may 
be able to avoid a leakage problem. If you do have a leak, the unit will have 
to be properly drained of Freon so that it can be recovered, and an 
environmentally safe coolant will have to be used to re-charge it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. We have fake brick veneer in our den, and we'd like to remove it and just 
paint the wall. I don't suppose there's an easy way to get this stuff off. 
</P>
<P>
 N.T., Placentia 
</P>
<P>
 A. Unfortunately, no, says Steve Sink of Angelus Quarries and Building Supply 
in Santa Ana. It's often been applied with mastic, which is like a cement. You 
can try using a solvent or a rub stone to remove the old mastic, but you may 
not be able to save the wall surface. You may be better off just removing the 
drywall and attaching new drywall.

<P>
 One look at Sea Design Furniture's Steamer chair and lounger, and sitting by 
the sea will become the order of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The chair and lounger, designed and manufactured by the San Clemente company, 
are made of teak. Both are fully collapsible for easy storing and transporting, 
and the joint mechanisms are rustproof. 
</P>
<P>
 Each piece of the chair is shaped by hand, so the seat and back conform to the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has a timeless feel, from the '30s and '40s," said Jan Tucker, owner of 
Sea Design. "It always reminds me of Cary Grant and 'An Affair to Remember."' 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker said she and her husband designed the chair because they liked the 
loungers on the Queen Mary. "Those chairs looked good, but there was no 'beef' 
to them. So we modified it to what we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 The chair is $949, the lounger $1,149. The Sea Design showroom is at 1504 
Avenida de la Estrella, No. G. For information, call (714) 498-9107. Harvest 
Dishes 
</P>
<P>
 Ceramist Barbara Eigen's earthenware looks almost good enough to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Specializing in serving pieces in the shape of fruits and vegetables, Eigen 
made a slight departure for her latest works, sold under her Eigen Arts label. 
</P>
<P>
 "The squash tureen and lidded casseroles are more decorative, more whimsical 
than my usual pieces, but they still function as serving pieces," said Eigen, 
49, who started in a SoHo loft in 1977. She moved her factory and studio to New 
Jersey about five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 All of Eigen's wares are dishwasher-safe and can be used for cooking in a slow 
oven. "I use them every day," she said,  
</P>
<P>
 Each piece is hand-painted and finished with a nontoxic glaze for sheen. 
</P>
<P>
 Eigen's collection, with pieces priced from $20 and up, can be purchased in 
Orange County at I. Magnin in Newport Beach, or by calling Eigen at (201) 
798-7310. Pet Project 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of Chef, her 13-year-old cat, a little more than a year ago, inspired 
Diana Laufer to create a pet memorial candle. 
</P>
<P>
 After an unsuccessful search for an affordable tribute, Laufer, an author and 
illustrator for children's books, decided to design something to help deal with 
her grief. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found tombstones and plaques, but nothing unique," said Laufer, owner/art 
director of Design Street Studios in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Furry Angel ($10.99) is a wax-filled glass tumbler with a silk-screened label 
that depicts ethereal animals flying around a poem. It comes with a card that 
suggests a candle-lighting ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 For information or to order, call (213) 939-6680 or write Furry Angel, 8391 
Beverly Blvd., No. 263, Los Angeles, CA 90048.

DECORATING; SISTER PARISH'S LEGACY: STYLING THE FAMILIAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Toss a patchwork quilt over the back of a sofa, stencil a pattern onto a wood 
floor, pair a primitive accessory such as a basket or a birdhouse with a silver 
candlestick, and you'll be borrowing from ideas popularized by Dorothy 
Kinnicutt Parish, also known as Sister Parish. 
</P>
<P>
 Parish (Sister was a family nickname), who died in September at age 84, was 
sought by the rich and famous. She took familiar furnishings and made them chic 
through her own sense of style in a decorating career that spanned six decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that Sister Parish was one of the biggest influences on 
decorating in the United States," Lou Gropp, editor of House Beautiful, said. 
"She dominated the decorating of the 1970s and '80s, and many of her ideas that 
were fresh and new in the 1970s are now in the mainstream of American 
decorating." 
</P>
<P>
 Her influence probably will live on. A number of the country's leading 
decorators, including Mark Hampton and Mario Buatta, acknowledge her effect on 
their work. And the firm she founded, Parish-Hadley Associates Inc. of New 
York, continues under the leadership of Albert Hadley, her partner and 
associate since 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Parish had no formal training, but a wonderful background," Hadley said. 
"Her motto was: 'Either you have it or you don't.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She had it. 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't have a high school diploma, but she had a privileged childhood. Her 
parents were antiques collectors with four homes, including one in Paris. She 
attended the elite Chapin School in New York City and the Foxcroft School in 
Middleburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 She started her business in 1933 in tony Far Hills, N.J., and her first 
clients were friends who admired the unconventional way she decorated her own 
weekend house in Far Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It never occurred to me that I wasn't qualified to give (advice)," she once 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1930s, in her first foray into decorating in her own home, she had her 
bedroom floor painted a cherry red with white diamonds and had a mantel of 
glass blocks installed. Later, in a traditional living room, she stenciled the 
floor with crisscross lines and put a little red star at each intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody else would have had the nerve to do it, but she had unbelievable 
assurance," Gropp said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had little regard for periods and she had a great eye for items," Hadley 
said. "They could cost a million dollars or a few dollars. She might put a prim 
wooden dog made by some backwoodsman up in Maine on a gilt wood and lacquer 
table." 
</P>
<P>
 When Sister Parish began using handicrafts in upscale rooms, it was highly 
unconventional. 
</P>
<P>
 She was one of the first to drape a patchwork quilt over the back of a sofa. 
She and Hadley worked with quilters from Selma, Ala., in the late 1960s to 
develop patchwork quilted yard goods. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, Parish-Hadley commissioned artists to paint old furniture in 
unusual colors and patterns. For example, a marble-topped console table was 
painted black with red dots.  
</P>
<P>
 They stocked handwoven Irish rugs and baskets and other crafts in a small 
private shop on New York's Upper East Side. It was open by invitation only. As 
the items were photographed in magazines, they spread into general use. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of her influence in American home decor is that she worked for many 
influential people -- Mellons, Rockefellers, Vanderbilts and Whitneys. She 
decorated the Georgetown home occupied by John and Jacqueline Kennedy when he 
was a senator from Massachusetts. In 1961 she was called to the White House by 
Jacqueline Kennedy to refurbish some rooms. But the two women eventually parted 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an unhappy divorce," said Pat Linden, who profiled Sister Parish in 
Town & Country magazine in September 1988. "Oh, she was young," Parish said 
when asked about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah, the Duchess of York, hired her in 1988 to put the Parish imprint on a 
new country house near Windsor Castle. The duchess's mother-in-law, the queen, 
later rescinded the assignment in favor of an English designer, but just 
getting in the door was a triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Parish gained early recognition through national magazines. In January 
1967, House and Garden featured her house in Maine with its painted white 
furniture and quilts and rag rugs. The departure from traditional decorating 
was on par with fashion's introduction to Dior's New Look. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Parish didn't readily admit to being influenced by anyone. But Linden 
believes she had some influence from British designers John Fowler and Nancy 
Lancaster, who helped originate the English country style. 
</P>
<P>
 "She developed a style of pastoral opulence, as if the vicar had married a 
rich wife, as Brooke Astor, who was one of her clients, is supposed to have 
said," Linden said.

HISTORY; NEED FOR LIGHT AND AIR INSIDE OPENS A WINDOW ON ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS V. DiBACCO, TIMES-POST NEWS SERVICE; DiBacco is a historian at 
American University in Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Windows, depicted in wall paintings of ancient Egyptians, are as old as homes. 
Even prehistoric peoples made holes in the roofs of their huts to provide 
ventilation and light. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the word "window" is derived from one of these functions, from the old 
Norse word, vindauga, made up of vind meaning wind and auga signifying eye. As 
early peoples devised other ways to remove smoke from their homes, such as 
through clay pipes, windows became prominent in the walls of homes instead of 
roofs. Animal skins, shells and scales of large fish were used as window 
coverings. 
</P>
<P>
 In ancient Greece, skylights were employed, often covered with mica sheets or 
thin slabs of translucent marble. Ancient Rome was the first civilization to 
have glass windows. It discovered the technology of mixing sand and other 
component materials and heating the mixture so it could be pressed and cast 
into small pieces that were formed into panes. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was a risky, costly and time-consuming process, and the homes of the 
wealthy were likely to be the only ones with glass windows. Nor was the quality 
high, with glass often marred by bubbles. 
</P>
<P>
 In medieval Europe, the huge size of Gothic architecture induced artisans to 
try other methods to make and install glass windows. Church windows were so 
large that a single pane of glass could not be used; instead, stained and 
painted glass in small pieces set in lead strips were fashioned into immense 
window designs towering skyward. 
</P>
<P>
 But the decorative technology was less appropriate for medieval castles, whose 
owners had to worry about military attacks in which glass windows were 
liabilities. Thus, shutters were often used to close windows in the homes of 
the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 15th Century, glass made its entry, usually on the upper part of a 
window, with shutters on the lower. But the glass remained in small panes 
because of the continued difficulty of making large sheets of glass of uniform 
thickness. Nor were glass windows affordable to common folk, who were forced to 
employ less-costly translucent materials, such as oiled paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Also by the 15th Century, architects began to consider the function of windows 
in a structure. Hence the rise of fenestration, or balancing windows to wall 
areas based on the theory that a building with too many windows was unstable. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 16th Century, casement windows (hinged at the side and swinging in and 
out) prevailed in much of Europe, with France's casement model extending to the 
floor and opening like folding doors. And for France's steep roofs, the dormer 
window to provide light to attics became widespread. In England, and later 
America, the double-hung window -- two frames of equal size that slide up and 
down -- prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, greater efficiency in glassmaking contributed to making these 
movements possible. By the 1700s, glass windows became the rule as the price 
was reduced. But it was a slow process: A window that required 24 panes in 1750 
might have only six half a century later. It wasn't until the Industrial 
Revolution in the late 19th Century that the machine-cylinder method of 
production made glass windows affordable for large numbers of people. 
</P>
<P>
 In the U.S., Sears, Roebuck & Co. could advertise in its 1897 catalogue a 
double-hung window measuring as large as 24 by 38 inches with a price tag of 
only 55 cents.

GARDENING; GET AN INSTANT LAWN OFF ON SOLID GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE REICH, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can purchase strips of sod, which is lawn grass with an inch or so of 
attached soil, to create an "instant lawn" to cover bare ground or to repair 
existing lawn. Cool, moist weather is ideal for establishing sod. 
</P>
<P>
 Sod is sold in strips of a few feet long and 12- to 24-inches wide. Quality 
sod should be free of weeds and pests and be of a type of grass adapted to your 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrange for delivery no more than a couple of days or so before you are going 
to lay sod. Occasionally sprinkle stored sod strips with enough water to keep 
them moist but not saturated. 
</P>
<P>
 You cannot expect sod simply placed upon the ground to grow -- the site must 
be prepared first. Before working the soil, pick up a clump and squeeze it to 
make sure that it is at the correct moisture level. 
</P>
<P>
 The clump should crumble with slight pressure. If the soil wads up, it is too 
wet; wait for it to dry out a bit. If the clump is rock hard, it is too dry; 
sprinkle it the day before you begin. If the ground is covered with heavy weed 
growth or existing lawn, strip it off with a shovel or a rented sod stripper to 
make subsequent rototilling easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Before tilling, also cover the ground with any lime or sulfur needed to adjust 
the soil pH and a three-inch layer of some organic material such as rotted 
manure, spent mushroom soil, compost or peat moss. Also spread a high 
phosphorus fertilizer, such as 10-20-20 or 5-15-15, at the rate of 25 pounds 
per thousand square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Rototill the area lengthwise and crosswise, loosening the soil to a depth of 
six inches. Do not overtill; your objective is to leave the soil in pea-sized 
granules, not dust. Next, rake the surface smooth, discarding rocks and other 
debris. Roll the surface lightly with an empty lawn roller, and you are ready 
to lay down the strips of sod. 
</P>
<P>
 Lay the first row of sod along a straight line in such a way that the sod 
strip is not buckled or stretched at any point. Use your driveway or a path as 
a guide. Otherwise, use a string stretched tightly between two stakes. Unroll 
each sod strip, taking care to avoid tearing, and press it firmly into 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 Sod will shrink slightly after it has been laid, so do not stretch it as you 
put it down, especially where edges meet. If the weather is hot, periodically 
sprinkle the sod with water. 
</P>
<P>
 Lay a plank on the first row to distribute your weight as you begin on the 
next row. Snug the next row, once again to allow for shrinkage. To avoid 
concentrating breaks in the sod in one area, stagger the joints between the 
pieces in the row so that they do not align with those in the first row. 
</P>
<P>
 Continue subsequent rows similarly, standing on a plank as you work, 
staggering joints and sprinkling with water if the weather is hot. When you 
reach an edge of your lawn, cut the sod to size either with a sharp spade or a 
serrated knife, such as a bread knife. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the whole ground is covered with sod, go over it with a roller weighted 
just enough to get rid of air pockets and to ensure good contact between the 
sod and the underlying soil. Roll first at right angles to the strips, then in 
the direction of the strips. After rolling, gently fluff up the grass blades 
with a bamboo rake.  
</P>
<P>
 You are now finished laying down the sod. But don't just walk away from your 
new lawn after giving it an admiring look. 
</P>
<P>
 The top inch of sod must not dry out until the roots knit to the underlying 
ground, so set up your sprinkler and apply enough water to wet the soil six 
inches deep. And on every sunny, warm day for the following few weeks, water 
lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Pay special attention to sod near pavement, because those areas dry out 
quickest and may need heavier spot watering. As roots from the sod grow into 
the soil below, approach a normal watering schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 If possible, keep off the grass for the few weeks it takes sod to establish.

BATHROOMS; SAVE WATER AND GET A HANDLE ON TYPES OF LOW-FLOW TOILETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New energy standards mean that any new toilet you buy will use less water. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Energy Policy Act of 1992 mandates that all new toilets 
manufactured in the United States or imported for residential use must be 
low-flow. 
</P>
<P>
 This means that toilets cannot use more than 1.6 gallons of water per flush -- 
compared to standard water-saving toilets that use 3.5 gallons per flush. 
</P>
<P>
 Most toilets manufactured in the 1970s or earlier use five to six gallons per 
flush. 
</P>
<P>
 There are three main types of low-flow toilet designs. 
</P>
<P>
 * The first type is the gravity toilet. In the past, toilets relied on 
gravity. Some of the new low-flow models still work on the same principle. They 
simply have steeper sides that increase gravitational pull to compensate for 
smaller water capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 * The second low-flow variety is the pressurized-tank toilet. A separate 
pressurized tank contained within the toilet tank pushes water into the bowl at 
a high velocity when the toilet is flushed. 
</P>
<P>
 * The third type of toilet features an electrically operated pump to quickly 
push water to the bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Which should you buy? 
</P>
<P>
 Most plumbing experts say that new low-flow gravity models are adequate for 
home use (although they may require an occasional double-flush). 
</P>
<P>
 The pressurized and electrically pumped models offer more flushing power.  
</P>
<P>
 Gravity models tend to cost less than half of what their more powerful 
competitors cost.

REMODELING; OLD HOUSE CAN'T CHARM ITS WAY OUT OF A RENOVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buying an older home for renovation can be an exciting and rewarding 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Aged brass doorknobs, ornately carved banisters, fine wall moldings, natural 
wood beams and trim are only a few of the features that attract many buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, along with their charm and style, older homes often have serious problems 
and limitations not apparent to the untrained eye. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, new paint could hide persistent flooding. Heavy carpeting may 
mask a rotting floor, and that attractive wood trim may be home to thousands of 
wood-eating insects. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers can also feel cheated when they discover that local zoning and building 
ordinances prohibit the remodeling and improvements planned when the house was 
bought. 
</P>
<P>
 It pays to hire a professional to evaluate a home's structural and mechanical 
condition, and about how much it will cost to fix it up, before you sign on the 
dotted line. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspection should cover roofing, walls, ceilings, floors, windows, doors, 
foundations and basement slabs. 
</P>
<P>
 An inspector will determine whether main structural components are sound, free 
from rot or insect damage and strong enough to support the weight of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspector will check out all exposed water and waste pipes, faucets, 
drainage, water heaters and connections to appliances. He or she will also 
evaluate the overall condition of the electrical system to see that it's 
adequate for your current and future needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Grounding connections and exposed wiring will be tested for overload 
protection as well as the efficiency of heating and cooling systems. 
</P>
<P>
 A home inspection typically costs one-tenth of 1% of the cost of the house, 
with a minimum charge of about $150.

 DOUBLE UP: Here's an idea from the Orange County Fire Chiefs Assn. that it 
hopes will catch on: When you change your clocks tonight (set them back an 
hour), also change the batteries in your smoke detectors. You do have smoke 
detectors, right? . . . . Fire officials say 12% of homes here are still 
without detectors -- and one of three with detectors has dead batteries. 
Detectors, the fire chiefs say, cut by half the risk of dying in a home fire.

 DON'S PLAZA: The late Donald F. Karcher, once president of Carl Karcher 
Enterprises, was a favorite at Cal State Fullerton. He led athletic 
fund-raising efforts there for more than two decades. The university has named 
the concessions area of the new Titan Stadium the Donald F. Karcher Plaza. It 
was fitting that the dedication took place at halftime of the 
Servite-Saddleback football game Friday: Karcher's grandson, Joe LeVecke, plays 
defense for Servite High. 
</P>
<P>
 FAREWELL PARTY: Their plant is closing and their jobs are in limbo, but for 
some 200 Hughes workers in Fullerton, this is the weekend to cast away their 
worries. . . . Eight busloads of them headed to the Excalibur Hotel in Las 
Vegas -- all on the company tab. It's a bonus to union employees for their hard 
work on a Navy display system project. Says David Ramirez, a 13-year crater and 
packer: "I'm gonna try to win a million bucks so I don't have to worry about my 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 LOVE & HEART: There's no shortage of places to exercise for a cause today. In 
Huntington Beach, there's the "Walk of Love" at Lake Park near Main Street, to 
raise money primarily for single-parent families. In Irvine, more than 7,000 
are expected to walk, run or ride bicycles in the annual "Heart & Sole 
Classic." Money raised will go toward fighting heart disease. . . . There's a 
race Sunday afternoon that may be different from anything you've ever seen: 
Twenty dachshunds will belly up to the finish line at Old World Village in 
Huntington Beach. New Dawn

 Standard Time begins tomorrow at 2 a.m. Set your clocks back one hour.

O.C. POLICE SEE FUNDING GAPS IN U.S. CRIME BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many of the same Orange County police chiefs who supported President Clinton's 
crime bill now say that the newly available federal funds might not be enough 
to put new officers on the streets immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 While Santa Ana and La Habra have already won grants to add officers to their 
forces, other local cities are saying they cannot afford to match the federal 
grant money which, under the bill's provisions, they are required to do. Cities 
may be obliged to pay 50% or more of the average annual salary and benefits to 
officers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Westminster, for example, Police Chief James Cook said his city may not 
even bother applying for a Community Oriented Policing grant at all, because 
the funding formula would require the city to kick in money it doesn't have. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same old federal government trick," said Cook, whose gang-prevention 
programs have won national recognition. "It is the federal government extending 
a few crumbs off the table, and they are expecting us to be thankful for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Cook said he has had to scrap plans for a special unit of six or 
seven officers he had hoped to fund with crime bill money. 
</P>
<P>
 Under guidelines released by the U.S. Department of Justice, the city's share 
of hiring only three officers could come to more than $100,000 per year for the 
next three years, Cook said. After that, when federal funds run dry, the cities 
would be required to pay the full tab, or about $180,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that, Cook said there is "a good chance" the city won't apply for a 
piece of the grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no pot of gold at the end of this rainbow," said Costa Mesa Police 
Chief David L. Snowden. "That's what happens when you get a bunch of 
bureaucrats, who have nothing to do with law enforcement, voting on stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 The funding concerns come at a critical time for Orange County's cities, which 
must decide by next month whether they intend to apply for the federal money 
under terms of the grant. 
</P>
<P>
 That deadline looms even as some agencies, including the Orange County 
Sheriff's Department, continue to express confusion over the most basic 
provisions of the bill: How many officers could be hired based on the federal 
contribution? How much will departments be required to pay in matching funds? 
And will cities be able to keep new officers working after the grant money runs 
out in 1996? 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got involved with this today," said Grace Denton, federal crime bill 
coordinator for most of Southern California. "It is very confusing. The police 
departments have a lot of questions. I think it's like any new program, you 
gotta play it by ear until you get it up and running." 
</P>
<P>
 Signed into law last month, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act 
of 1994 carried the promise of putting 100,000 more police on the nation's 
streets within the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 3,000 could be hired in California, according to a report by the 
state Legislative Analyst's Office. But the same report also contains a plainly 
worded warning for local jurisdictions that might be looking to bolster their 
police ranks at the expense of the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 "The addition of new law enforcement personnel will likely result in 
significant increases in the costs of the state and county criminal justice 
system," the report stated, "and significant short-term and long-term costs for 
hiring the new officers." 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, for example, federal funds have already been approved to help 
hire 15 additional officers under terms of the crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police and city officials say they are glad to get the money, it also 
means that the city will have to contribute $534,000 in the first year of the 
grant, $576,000 in the second year and $621,000 in the third, Lt. Robert Helton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (local matching) money is a major decision for any city," Helton said. 
"It's a legitimate concern. We're all aware in law enforcement of the shrinking 
dollars available. But these opportunities don't come along that frequently. If 
things hold true with finances, we'll be OK. But the economics could change 
drastically." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Helton said the department remains committed to beefing up the 
376-member force in Orange County's most crime-plagued city. 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra Police Chief Steven Staveley has heard the funding fears of other 
departments, but his department has decided to spend $408,000 over the next 
three years in matching funds to add five more officers to the existing 
68-member force. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, we're in good fiscal condition and the City Council thinks this 
is a good idea," the chief said. "I don't think we will ever regret this 
decision, but there are other places that won't be able to afford this." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton is one of those towns. Police Chief Patrick McKinley, who was not 
supportive of the bill because of doubts about funding, said the city simply 
"won't be playing in this ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid of what I see happening," McKinley said. "I'm afraid the people up 
in Washington might have to divert money from programs that are working, like 
narcotics enforcement, to pay for this. . . . I'm just not a big flag-waver." 
</P>
<P>
 McKinley said he would like to increase the Fullerton force by at least three 
officers, but believes there isn't enough money to do even that. 
</P>
<P>
 He characterized the crime bill as "somebody telling you that he'll sell a 
$1-million airplane for $100,000." 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like a good deal, but if you don't have the $100,000 you still 
can't buy it," the chief said. "You just have to let it go." 
</P>
<P>
 Congressman Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach), who voted against the crime 
bill, said the chiefs' concerns are "no surprise to me." 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing was a fraud to begin with," Rohrabacher said, maintaining 
that he and other opposing Republicans repeatedly expressed concerns about the 
amount of money that cities, counties and states would have to provide in 
matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Democrats really ballyhooed this program," the congressman said. "It's 
not until the public gets to read the fine print that they realize they have 
been conned." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the exodus of businesses from California and the post-Cold War decline 
in locally based defense industries, the congressman said Southern California, 
including Orange County, continues to suffer economically. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are those who believe that the federal money is better than not 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realize it's not the choice of most cities to have to come up with matching 
funds," Garden Grove Police Chief Stanley L. Knee said. "But we also have to 
understand that the federal government does not have an unlimited tap."

THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS STAGE ANTI-187 WALKOUT; PROTEST: NO INJURIES, ARRESTS ARE 
REPORTED. THE MASS DEMONSTRATIONS PROMPT A TACTICAL ALERT BY THE LAPD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the largest student protests to date against Proposition 187, thousands of 
Southern California youths walked off their campuses Friday, prompting a 
tactical alert by Los Angeles police, tense standoffs with riot-ready officers, 
and scattered fighting and vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was seriously injured or arrested during mass demonstrations in Van 
Nuys and Chatsworth, where an estimated 2,500 impassioned teen-agers waved 
Mexican and Central American flags and chanted in Spanish, "No 187!" and "The 
people united will never be defeated." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our dream is to go to school and be somebody in life, and if this law passes 
we won't be able to fulfill our dreams," said Blanca Menjivar, a junior at 
Birmingham High School in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The protests involving 11 schools in the San Fernando Valley were among a 
half-dozen mostly peaceful incidents throughout Southern California in which 
students abandoned books for bullhorns to decry Proposition 187, the 
controversial anti-immigration measure that would deny public services, 
including education, to illegal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Students in Venice, Westchester, South Los Angeles and San Gabriel staged 
protests, as did youths in three San Diego schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard and Camarillo, 2,000 students took to the streets in what is 
believed to be the largest student walkout in Ventura County history. 
</P>
<P>
 The largely calm demonstration, which culminated at a downtown Oxnard park, 
was marred by a series of fights that police attributed to gang rivalries, not 
political fervor. Four demonstrators were arrested, including three juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
 But Van Nuys played host to the most raucous showdown of the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of helmeted police armed with batons and shotguns faced off hundreds of 
students near the Van Nuys government center and Van Nuys High School. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one student was struck by a police baton and a small group was 
sprayed with pepper spray during the Van Nuys Civic Center confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 Marchers kept to the sidewalks along most of their routes but there was some 
traffic disruption. The most serious trouble that Los Angeles police reported 
was smashed windows in a patrol car and vandalism at a Van Nuys convenience 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department and Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
remained on tactical alert throughout the day. Police also braced for possible 
trouble at a homecoming game and dance at Van Nuys High School Friday night, 
but no problems had been reported by late in the evening.  
</P>
<P>
 Police spokesman Lt. John Dunkin said the tactical alert served two purposes: 
It allowed LAPD Chief Willie L. Williams to keep officers over for double 
shifts and cleared the way for officers in other parts of the city to assist. 
The Valley patrols were briefly reinforced by officers from the Metro Division. 
The alert was called off at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Nuys demonstrations began early Friday morning at Fulton Middle 
School, where at least 200 students left the campus and walked 2 1/2 miles to 
Monroe High School in North Hills, their ranks growing along the way. The group 
then walked to Sepulveda Middle School, unaware that students there had Friday 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 Undeterred, demonstrators continued about three more miles to Van Nuys High 
School where more students were drawn into the march, some jumping fences to 
join in. 
</P>
<P>
 At about the same time, about 400 youths walked off the campus of Birmingham 
High School in Van Nuys and set off on a march of their own -- picking up 
classmates from Mulholland and Van Nuys Middle Schools as well as supportive 
passersby. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorists honked in approval while apartment dwellers leaned over their 
balconies for a better view, smiling and raising their fists. 
</P>
<P>
 Teodora Sandoval de Rodriguez, who lives near the Van Nuys government center, 
was at the corner of Van Nuys and Victory boulevards when she saw the students 
marching. She decided to join them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to show them my support," she said. "I think it's great that they 
have commitment to protest like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Some school administrators also joined the fray -- walking along or following 
close by in cars to ensure the students' safety. "I monitored them all the way 
through," said Birmingham High School Principal Jerry Kleinman. 
</P>
<P>
 Their numbers swelling as they continued their trek, neither group of students 
had apparent leaders or a planned route, and they ended up in the same two 
areas spontaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the marchers reached the Van Nuys Civic Center and nearby Van Nuys 
High School, they were met by a throng of Los Angeles police clad in riot gear, 
some wielding shotguns and carrying cartridges with rubber bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 Some demonstrators complained that the police were overreacting by dispatching 
so many officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "All those weapons!" said Ivan Bertran, 17, a senior at Van Nuys High School. 
"We've got signs. Like we're really going to hurt them with signs." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Leticia Zelaya, 15, a sophomore at Van Nuys High: "Freedom of speech is 
supposed to mean you can say what you want to say. The cops are making a big 
deal of this. They're treating us like animals. We ain't animals." 
</P>
<P>
 About 2 p.m., six yellow school buses roared to a stop in the middle of Van 
Nuys Boulevard near the Civic Center. Over a bullhorn, officers instructed the 
exhausted students to get on the bus or face arrest. By 2:15 p.m., the buses 
departed, ending the demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 At Van Nuys High School the demonstration ended when police herded students on 
foot into the football stadium, where the gate was then locked. 
</P>
<P>
 In a larger, but calmer Valley protest Friday, 2,000 students from Chatsworth 
High School took part in a rally followed by an impromptu march through area 
streets. Police reported no trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 School-based protests against Proposition 187 have been rising in number and 
fervor in recent weeks as the Nov. 8 election nears, while parents and leaders 
of the No on 187 campaign have been trying to defuse enthusiasm for the 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-Proposition 187 campaign officials and student leaders said they would 
hold a press conference next week in the hope of persuading students to call 
off a countywide school walkout planned for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that there are a lot of other ways that kids can extend energies and 
help defeat Prop. 187," said Scott MacDonald, a spokesman for the No on 187 
movement, which now opposes student walkouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand the frustration that students must have -- they can't vote, and 
much of this is aimed at their schools and will hurt their schools," MacDonald 
continued. "But there are a lot of things we need to be talking about and this 
is not the best way to get people talking." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Board of Education scheduled a special meeting Monday 
afternoon to discuss the walkouts, the district's response, and the possibility 
of more class disruptions as the Nov. 8 elections draw near. 
</P>
<P>
 "As it gets closer to the election, I think it's appropriate that we 
coordinate the response," said board President Mark Slavkin, who was en route 
to Los Angeles from Washington, D.C., Friday with Supt. Sid Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 "To disrupt school and leave campus, I think undermines the cause," Slavkin 
said.

measure. Students from middle and highs schools in VAn Nuys marched about five 
miles, blocking traffic and prompting police in riot gear to respond for crowd 
control. By day's end, most of the students peacefully returned to their

CSUN HANDLING OF SUSPECT NOT USUAL IN SURVEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER and IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<P>
 Cal State Northridge, which is allowing a football player charged with 
attempted murder to remain on its team, is out of step with the common 
disciplinary practice followed by major universities nationwide, according to a 
survey of athletic departments conducted by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Most schools contacted said student athletes arrested for alleged crimes, 
especially serious ones, typically are suspended from their teams pending 
resolution of their legal troubles. And CSUN's own football handbook says 
suspension is an option the university can consider. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most schools do go to the option of suspending the player or asking them to 
leave the team for some period of time," said Kathryn Reith, a spokeswoman for 
the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. The NCAA oversees intercollegiate 
sports, but leaves such decisions to schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far, however, CSUN officials, based on legal advice, have declined to 
issue a suspension to Jonathan G. Beauregard, 22, CSUN's starting offensive 
right guard. He is accused of shooting and wounding his former girlfriend and a 
male companion outside a San Bernardino bar on Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "We follow the U.S. Constitution which says people are presumed innocent until 
proven guilty," said Stephen McCarthy, a spokesman for the 20-campus Cal State 
system, citing advice from a Cal State attorney. "What if a person is 
exonerated? You've suspended them and they haven't done anything." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, CSUN's football handbook states, "Any trouble with the law will be 
dealt with on the basis of presumed innocent until proven otherwise." But it 
also adds: "However, suspension during litigation will be an option that can be 
taken," university officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of CSUN's stance, after a scheduled court hearing on the charges next 
Friday in San Bernardino, the 5-foot-11, 270-pound senior, who is free on 
$100,000 bail, is expected to travel to Cedar City, Utah, for the Matadors' 
game against Southern Utah University the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 The team does not play today. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic officials elsewhere maintained that coaches routinely suspend players 
for various reasons, and don't need a guilty verdict to justify such decisions. 
"I don't think we would do it if we thought there was a problem," said Marc 
Dellins, a UCLA spokesman, of post-arrest suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA has periodically taken the step of suspending athletes promptly after 
their arrests. Other campuses that have taken similar steps in recent years 
include Notre Dame, USC, the University of Miami, the University of 
Missouri-Columbia and the University of Louisville, officials there said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Cal State system, where campuses are free to set their own policies, 
the Fullerton and San Diego campuses also have both suspended athletes for 
alleged criminal conduct, officials at those campuses said. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest episode nationally occurred this week when the University of Miami 
Hurricanes placed reserve defensive back Tremain Mack on indefinite suspension. 
He was arrested last Sunday on suspicion of battery on a police officer, 
resisting arrest and driving under the influence after a traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not consider participation in intercollegiate athletics to be a right. 
We consider it to be an opportunity and a privilege that can be withdrawn 
unilaterally by an institution," said Athletic Director Paul Dee, who was the 
university's chief attorney for 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 He concurred that suspensions have become the common response by universities 
when their student athletes are arrested. The decision is not meant as a 
judgment of guilt, but to preserve a campus' public image, shield the team from 
distraction or other factors, various athletic officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of nine major universities contacted by The Times (other than Cal State 
Northridge), only the University of Missouri-Columbia reported having a 
standard policy. At that campus, any athlete charged with a felony is suspended 
at least to start, said Athletic Director Joe Castiglione. One of the schools, 
Fresno State, typically allows athletes to keep playing despite arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri's Castiglione said the university adopted the suspension policy 
several years ago to warn athletes in advance of the consequences and provide a 
clear road map for university officials. Since then, Castiglione said, the 
campus has had "much fewer problems" with alleged criminal conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 For Cal State Northridge, which fields a Division 1-AA football team that has 
a small following on campus, the Beauregard episode, whether he is guilty or 
not, has been an unwanted dose of publicity on the heels of the campus' 
recovery from the January earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Faculty Senate President Nancy Owens of the episode, "It's embarrassing 
for the university. We are interested in being portrayed in a better light." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy also comes at a time when the CSUN athletic program's funding 
is under review. 
</P>
<P>
 Students last week voted down a proposal that would have generated $2.25 
million annually for the athletic department. University administrators are now 
studying budgetary options that include the possibility of severe cuts in 
athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Hiegert, CSUN's athletic director, said Northridge officials will not be 
swayed by what other universities do. "The policies of those institutions and 
the policies of those departments are theirs alone," he said. CSUN President 
Blenda Wilson did not respond to requests for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard was arrested Aug. 29 on suspicion of shooting his former 
girlfriend, Dunyella Darshell Smith, and a man with her, Von Eric Thompson, 
several hours earlier while Smith and Thompson were sitting in Thompson's truck 
outside a San Bernardino bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, 21, of San Bernardino, was hit once in the hip. Thompson, 26, of 
Rialto, a guard at the bar, was shot in the arm. 
</P>
<P>
 A second shot hit Thompson "right about where his heart would be" but was 
blocked by the bullet-resistant vest he was wearing, police Detective Roy Izumi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus athletic officials have said they did not even learn of Beauregard's 
arrest until more than a month after the shooting took place. The matter became 
public after news reporters raised questions about it. A few days later, campus 
officials said they would not suspend the player and planned to monitor his 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 After an Oct. 19 hearing, when his bail was raised from $15,000 to $100,000, 
Beauregard was jailed in San Bernardino. He was released Tuesday after posting 
bail and attended football practice in Northridge a few hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 This past week, CSUN public relations director Bruce Erickson gave a more 
precise campus position based on legal advice: Beauregard would not be 
suspended unless he were ordered to stand trial after a preliminary hearing, or 
earlier were to enter a guilty plea to end the case. 
</P>

CLUB'S ONGOING SUCCESS SPEAKS VOLUMES; ORGANIZATIONS: 70 YEARS AFTER IT WAS 
FOUNDED IN SANTA ANA, TOASTMASTERS STILL HELPS PEOPLE EXPRESS THEMSELVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In meeting rooms across America, secretaries, engineers and executives gather 
regularly for sessions that often begin with a salute to Ralph C. Smedley. 
</P>
<P>
 They are members of Toastmasters International, and they still pay homage to 
Smedley, who founded the organization 70 years ago this month in the basement 
of the YMCA in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Started as a self-help group for people jittery about speaking in public, 
Toastmasters now boasts 8,100 chapters -- including about 200 in Orange County 
-- where members for years have been meeting weekly to practice making speeches 
and to critique each other's oratorical efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in the '90s, Toastmasters is finding a new niche: teaching professionals 
in technical fields how to prepare a talk and deliver it effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "Engineers are notorious for being bad oral communicators," said William 
Womack, a professor of communications at Chapman University in Orange. "I have 
seen some who are great, but they are definitely the exception." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, technology experts are often called upon to meet with clients and to 
give presentations, and if they do badly, the employer's image may suffer. To 
make sure that doesn't happen, some of Southern California's biggest 
corporations sponsor their own Toastmasters groups, among them Fluor Daniel 
Inc., Bergen Brunswig Corp., CalComp Inc., Rockwell International Corp. and 
McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraging employees to become better communicators is also a way to prepare 
them for upper management, said Renee Christensen, an industrial psychologist 
and president of Employee Support Systems Co. in Orange. Even the brightest and 
most capable people, she said, are unlikely candidates for executive positions 
if they cannot present themselves well. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives are blunt about the problem: "Engineers tend to be very 
introverted," said Bob Johnson, director of contracts at Anaheim-based CalComp, 
a division of defense contractor Lockheed Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson joined Toastmasters in 1960 because he suffered almost debilitating 
attacks of "butterflies" before every talk he gave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared to death when I was called upon to speak at project meetings," 
said Johnson, who was a business manager at Hughes Electronics in Fullerton at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
 After a year at Toastmasters, he said, he not only overcame his fear but 
polished his skills so that he has since had the confidence to seek jobs that 
require public speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Anxiety about giving speeches is quite common, said J. Douglas Andrews, 
professor of business communications and assistant dean of USC's School of 
Business Administration. In fact, it is the situation that many people say they 
fear most, according to several studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to overcome that fear and to become a calm, effective speaker, he 
said, is simply to practice and get some feedback. 
</P>
<P>
 Toastmasters strives to help men and women do just that. 
</P>
<P>
 The meetings always start and end on time, and they follow a strict schedule. 
To ensure that the speeches, limited to about seven minutes each, end promptly, 
a timekeeper is chosen for each session to signal the speakers if they talk too 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 A member may play one of a number of roles. The Toastmaster of the Day 
presides over the meeting. A grammarian is appointed to monitor awkward and 
improper uses of language. And the "ah counter" is responsible for tallying the 
number of times a speaker pauses and says, "Ah . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone plays the role of evaluator. At the end of the "table topics" section 
of the meeting, when some members are called upon to give impromptu two-minute 
speeches on assigned topics, everyone else evaluates the presentations. Those 
giving prepared speeches also get critiques. And members recognize each others' 
achievements by voting on the best prepared speech, the most improved speaker 
and the best impromptu presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the sessions are rigorous -- each includes a brief business meeting, 
about 10 speeches plus evaluations, all in two hours or less -- the atmosphere 
is comfortable and supportive. At the end of each speech, during recognition 
times and even during the business segment, members applaud each other often 
and heartily. The evaluations, even when critical, are couched in kind words. 
</P>
<P>
 A limitation to the method, Chapman professor Womack said, is that emphasis is 
on actual presentation of the speech, not on how it is constructed. A person 
might be a bad speaker, he said, because he or she is a bad writer and cannot 
organize material in a logical way that an audience can follow. 
</P>
<P>
 But Andrews at USC contests that. Businesses are becoming increasingly aware 
of the value of effective communication in the workplace, and, given that 
hiring experts to coach people one on one would be prohibitively expensive, he 
said, Toastmasters is a cost-effective alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization, which charges $36 a person for annual dues plus a $16 fee 
for materials, gives novice speakers what they need most, Andrews said: a lot 
of practice and constant feedback. 
</P>
<P>
 Many chapters, he said, have volunteer advisers who teach others how to be 
good evaluators or may even do most of the critiques themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Toastmasters now has 170,000 members across the United States and 50 other 
countries. Over the years, more than 3 million people have enrolled in the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Women, excluded for the first 50 years of Toastmasters' existence, now make up 
half of the membership, and the organization this year has its second female 
national president. She is Pauline Shirley, executive manager of Sherman R. 
Smoot Corp., a construction management firm in Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 Among Toastmasters' graduates are some of America's top executives: Paul 
Orreffice, former chairman of Dow Chemical Co.; Peter Coors, chief executive 
officer of Coors Brewing Co.; and Les McCraw, chief executive officer of Fluor 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Most companies with their own Toastmasters chapters provide a space to meet 
and offer moral support. The employees themselves typically pay their own fees, 
but some corporations, including Fluor, pick up part of the tab. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas offers another incentive for joining Toastmasters: Time 
spent in meetings can count as part of the continuing education each employee 
is required to complete every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies see a definite advantage to having Toastmasters in-house. 
</P>
<P>
 "We absolutely see them improve their speaking skills," said Carol Sherman, 
executive vice president at Bergen Brunswig Corp. in Orange, which founded its 
chapter in 1989. "It benefits us because they are participating in meetings 
both inside and outside the company all the time."

O.C. MISSIONARIES AID RWANDAN ORPHANS; SUFFERING: SAFE HARBOR GROUP MEMBERS 
RETURN TO TELL OF PLIGHT OF MANY SERIOUSLY ILL YOUNGSTERS BADLY IN NEED OF 
MEDICAL TREATMENT AND ANTIBIOTICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A team of Orange County missionaries who recently returned from Rwanda said 
they found orphans with pneumonia and tuberculosis and no medicine to treat 
them, children with raging ear infections, and a child considered deaf but who 
could hear if only he had a hearing aid.  
</P>
<P>
 The 12-day trip by Safe Harbor International, which is part of Calvary Chapel 
in Rancho Santa Margarita, took the missionaries to orphanages bursting with 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children were very excited to see us," said Ron Neely, the director of 
Safe Harbor. But, he said, "Some of them were really sick so we had to scramble 
to diagnose them and get them treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 In Kayonza, 36 miles from the capital, Kigali, the team transported an 
8-year-old boy weighing only 29 pounds and suffering a 106-degree fever from 
tuberculosis to the local hospital for treatment. Team members also fitted the 
hearing-impaired child for a hearing aid that will be manufactured in 
neighboring Uganda and sent to the orphanage as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Neely, a Lake Forest resident, also was on Safe Harbor's first relief mission 
to Rwanda in August. During that trip, the three missionaries established 
contact with the Kayonza orphanage, whose population has increased from 120 to 
137 children, and delivered diapers, water purifiers and food donated by other 
relief organizations in Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the August trip Safe Harbor has used a Ugandan contact to deliver 150 
bunk beds, mattresses, sheets, pillows and sandals to the Kayonza orphanage. On 
this trip, the group delivered 2 1/2 tons of food, mostly beans and flour, as 
well as medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Ruff, a registered nurse who traveled with Safe Harbor, said she found 
the medical conditions distressing but the sense of accomplishment rewarding. 
She prescribed antibiotics, cleaned up wounds and dispensed aspirin and 
vitamins for hundreds of children. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is so much need there, the need can be overwhelming," she said. "But if 
everyone did their part you could all have contributions, and make a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 She said one sight that still haunts her was a field of clothed skeletons less 
than a mile from the Kayonza orphanage. One orphan even was playing with a 
skull, kicking it around the front yard.

 "Some of the children are numb," Ruff said. "They've seen so much. Their 
emotions have just been seared by this war. Those children need a lot of help 
emotionally." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am motivated by love to help them," Neely said. "We can share our 
abundance. That's the minimum we can do. We will continue to support the 
children through the duration."

SMEDLEY: A QUIET MAN WITH LOTS TO SAY ABOUT SPEECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ralph C. Smedley, who founded Toastmasters in Santa Ana in 1924, was never a 
person who would have been described as flashy or flamboyant. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, he lived modestly and quietly, and he was known as a tireless worker 
with a passion for helping others to realize their full potential. And he was 
determined to make Toastmasters, his brainchild, a success. 
</P>
<P>
 His first attempt was in 1903, just after he graduated from Wesleyan 
University in Bloomington, Ill. He took a job as educational director of the 
Bloomington YMCA and, when he noticed that many of the boys lacked 
sophisticated communications skills, he started a speaking club. But when he 
changed jobs and moved to nearby Freeport, the club in Bloomington fell apart. 
</P>
<P>
 In Freeport, Smedley tried again, this time encouraging local businessmen to 
sign up to improve their speaking ability. But the idea never caught on -- 
until he moved to California in 1924 to take a job at the YMCA in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, he organized an all-male oratory group. He named it Toastmasters 
because the format was like that of a banquet, with a leader chosen at each 
meeting to act as master of ceremonies and introduce the speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the concept was a hit. As men from adjacent communities heard about 
it, they began traveling to Santa Ana to sit in on Toastmasters meetings and 
ask how they could start their own chapters. 
</P>
<P>
 Smedley, always eager to see his idea spread, helped found new groups and 
eventually united the Southern California clubs in a federation. Through that 
organization, they coordinated activities, such as speaking contests between 
clubs, and settled on uniform methods for teaching effective speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 (Later in his life, Smedley speculated that Toastmasters finally took hold in 
Southern California because of the region's characteristic high spirits and 
optimism.) 
</P>
<P>
 Smedley kept his day job at the YMCA but spent his evenings writing articles 
about the art of speaking. Some of that literature is still used by 
Toastmasters today. His theory about good speaking, simply put, is that a 
person should address a group just as he or she would one person. 
</P>
<P>
 As examples of great orators, he held up President Franklin D. Roosevelt and 
humorist Will Rogers. He pointed out to colleagues that both men's highly 
acclaimed radio talks succeeded because each listener felt as if he or she was 
an audience of one. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Toastmasters continued to grow. In 1941, the organization was 
large enough to hire Smedley as its leader full time. He gave up his job as 
general secretary of the Santa Ana YMCA and rented a 12-by-16-foot office in 
downtown Santa Ana. From there, he handled the organization's growing 
correspondence and distributed educational materials to clubs that were 
springing up across the nation and around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 As the group's educational director, he wrote the two manuals -- "Basic 
Training" and "Beyond Basic Training" -- that Toastmasters still use. He also 
edited the organization's magazine, The Toastmaster, and wrote many of its 
articles. 
</P>
<P>
 Smedley was honored by Toastmasters International in 1956 at a national 
convention where he was elected president and board member for life. He 
continued to work for the organization as educational director until shortly 
before his death in 1965 at 87. 
</P>
<P>
 Smedley lived in Orange County until he died. Toastmasters International moved 
its headquarters in 1990 from Santa Ana to Rancho Santa Margarita.

COLLEGE CLUB ANGRY OVER SEA LION'S DEATH; COURT: AN EXPLOSIVE IN A FISH BLEW 
OFF THE ANIMAL'S HEAD IN FRONT OF A PASSING GROUP OF SCHOOLCHILDREN. THE 
SUSPECT DENIES GUILT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An Orange Coast College science club has started a letter-writing campaign to 
push for tough prosecution of a man accused of blowing up a sea lion by tossing 
it a dead fish with an explosive inside.  
</P>
<P>
 The Marine Mammal Research Group, a club of 25 students interested in marine 
biology, wants students and other people interested in sea lions to send 
letters to Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti and encourage his office to 
fully prosecute a man arrested on suspicion of killing the sea lion nicknamed 
Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent Terzoli, a San Pedro fisherman, was charged in June with felony 
cruelty to animals in the April 8 incident near Berth 73 in Los Angeles Harbor. 
Police allege that Terzoli threw Oscar a "seal bomb" -- an explosive usually 
used to harmlessly scare away sea lions -- inside a fish carcass. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosive blew the mammal's head off, and the incident was witnessed by a 
boatload of passing schoolchildren on a harbor tour, police said.  
</P>
<P>
 Oscar -- also known as Jelly by some old salts and regulars in the harbor area 
-- was a frequent visitor to the San Pedro waterfront and often ate what 
visitors threw to him, Los Angeles Port Police Lt. Martin Renteria said.  
</P>
<P>
 Renteria said concerned residents called the police after the incident. "We 
had several complaints about how cruel it was to destroy an animal," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 OCC marine biology professor Dennis Kelly, who advises the Marine Mammal 
Research Group, said students do not want charges against the fisherman to be 
reduced in any plea-bargaining arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students want to encourage the district attorney to fully prosecute the 
gentleman who carried out this deed," Kelly said. "It was pretty awful." 
</P>
<P>
 The charge against Terzoli carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison 
and a $20,000 fine. After his arrest in June, Terzoli told reporters he was 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly said the death-by-seal-bomb was a violation of the Marine Animal 
Protection Act and difficult to accept because the animal had become accustomed 
to interacting with people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a sea lion that was encouraged by people in that area to come around 
and ask for food," Kelly said. "It had become tame." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Kelly, seal bombs are devices similar to firecrackers, measuring 
about 3 1/2 inches long and half an inch wide. Fishermen may legally toss them 
in the water, where their blasts scare off hungry sea lions, Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Heath, assistant professor of biology at Fullerton College, said she 
has never seen a similar incident against a sea lion but has seen animals with 
bullet holes on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an attitude problem," said Heath, who has led summer student groups from 
Orange County to Baja California to study sea lions and marine wildlife. "Are 
we the only ones allowed to eat fish, or do we share?" 
</P>
<P>
 Renteria said the case is scheduled to go to a jury trial Nov. 15.

CITYSCAPES / NORA ZAMICHOW: 'IT'S LIKE FINDING THAT BLUE, MOLDY THING AT THE 
BACK OF THE FRIDGE. . . . IT SURE IS PUNGENT.'; AH, AUTUMN IN L.A.: TIME TO 
STEER CLEAR OF THOSE SMELLY LAWNS 
</P>

<P>
 As the evening air turns crisp, neighbors set pumpkins on doorsteps, and a 
pungent aroma wafts through the streets and across back yards. 
</P>
<P>
 It creeps into your home, despite the closed windows. It permeates your 
clothing. It clings to your hair. It means you walk cautiously into a room, 
particularly among strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the legacy of a Southern California rite of fall: the odor of steer 
manure spread to speed the sprouting of reseeded lawns. In the spring, the 
honey-sweet scent of orange blossoms fills entire neighborhoods; in autumn, 
it's as though a dairy barn moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 But inhale deeply, if you dare: Steer manure on lawns is about to go the way 
of rotary telephones. Soon this will be a smell of nostalgia as more and more 
yards grow year-round green grass, like the increasingly popular dwarf fescue, 
and as an increasing chorus of experts says steer manure, loaded with salt, 
offers little long-term benefit to soil. (Other non-smelly though more 
expensive alternatives are available.) 
</P>
<P>
 In a land where face lifts and tummy tucks reign, it's no surprise that we 
want our Bermuda grass lawns -- ordinarily brown and dormant at this time of 
the year -- to defy nature and look like Bob Hope's golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 And so for now, in yard after yard, like a contagious disease spreading on 
certain streets, lawns succumb to the telltale brown streaks and splotches 
emitting a stubborn odor that worsens after it's dampened by sprinklers. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the stench subsides, brilliant green sprouts of rye grass emerge. 
Within three weeks, a new lawn is born, cold-weather grass that will flourish 
until temperatures soar, a tribute to fall in Southern California. 
</P>

 When Charie Van Luvannee returned from work to her ground-floor Pasadena 
apartment last week, she was rather alarmed. My God, the sewage pipes burst, 
thought the Pennsylvania native. 
</P>
<P>
 But as she took her Doberman, Sturmy, out for his evening walk, Van Luvannee 
realized what the gardeners had done. She snapped shut every window in her 
two-bedroom apartment. She purchased four room deodorizers. She turned on the 
air conditioner, despite the chilly evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the stench of manure lingered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a shock when you are not expecting it," said Van Luvannee, a 
psychotherapist. "It was gagging." And it was irritating. Van Luvannee would 
never allow her dog to defecate in the yard of her Orange Grove Avenue 
apartment complex, a place so particular that officials restrict the colors of 
patio umbrellas. Yet here she was, gasping for fresh air and inhaling what 
smelled like a stockyard. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, she figured, another one of her Southern California experiences. 
Without a doubt, it paled beside her memory of the riots, fires, earthquake and 
the time she came across two gang members shot dead in a car in the supermarket 
parking lot. It was, however, another time for her to turn to Sturmy and say, 
"We're not in Lancaster, Pa., anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The smell, however, doesn't bother everyone. It makes Beth Pickert think of 
her childhood and her parents' house in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 For Pickert, a full-time mom to a lively 4-year-old and 20-month- old twins, 
having her Mar Vista lawn done is the kickoff for fall. It triggers an 
unrelenting schedule of birthdays, holidays and other rituals, such as cleaning 
out closets and hanging Halloween decorations. 
</P>
<P>
 When the lawn man, Brett Arellano, arrived at her house to spread steer 
manure, Pickert did what any reasonable Angeleno would do. She left. 
</P>
<P>
 At Green Scene Inc., the Sun Valley-based lawn maintenance company where 
Arellano works, employees draw straws to see who ends up with the manure jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The smell will stick," explained Arellano. "It's never a mystery as to who 
did the manure work." 
</P>
<P>
 Arellano, his black hair combed smoothly into a ponytail, is good-natured 
about his task. "If anyone is going to handle bull----, it'll be me," he jokes 
as he pours a sack of manure into a hand-pushed roller. 
</P>
<P>
 He forgot to bring his rubber boots, which he usually wears for a job like 
this. But he remembered another set of clothes, which he planned to change into 
immediately after finishing Pickert's yard. Because of the stench, Arellano 
won't wash these work clothes at home, they go straight to the coin laundry. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, Arellano, who moved here from Kansas in hopes of joining a rock 
band, wears shorts at work. (His legs, he says, "are the one thing I have left 
that still look good.") But for an assignment like this, he dons black jeans, 
refusing to wear the company-issued pants because they "look geeky."  
</P>
<P>
 "This is L.A." said Arellano, 28, whose hero is Mick Jagger. "Vanity doesn't 
escape the lawn care business, not in this town." 
</P>
<P>
 The first time Arellano ever spread manure in a yard, he thought it was going 
to make him ill. "It's like finding that blue, moldy thing at the back of the 
fridge; you're not sure what it was or what it became, but it sure is pungent." 
</P>
<P>
 But these days, he's grown more accustomed to the odor. "I played football, so 
I can handle anything," he said. "Besides, I like autumn."

BIAS CASE TAKES TOLL ON EX-HUGHES WORKERS; COURTS: ONE OF THE MEN WHO SHARE A 
$89.5-MILLION JUDGMENT IS STRUGGLING TO GET HIS LIFE IN ORDER. THE OTHER BLAMES 
HIS HEALTH PROBLEMS ON STRESS.

<P>
 For 10 years, Jeffrey Lane, a 39-year-old USC physics graduate, worked 
diligently as a engineer for Hughes Aircraft Co. in its Space and 
Communications Division in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, Lane said, he received only one promotion, while most of the 
white male employees received one every three to five years. Lane, who is 
black, said he found out that he was making only about 60% of the salary his 
white co-workers were being paid. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, after years of continuous verbal and written appeals to his 
supervisors, Lane filed a complaint with Hughes' Human Resources Department, 
alleging racial discrimination and asking for pay lost because of failure to 
receive promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 After four months, Lane said, officials from the department responded, saying 
their investigation showed no discrimination and that the $400,000 he was 
asking for was excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 "How could they say I was asking for too much money if there was no 
discrimination?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, David Villalpando, a Latino supervisor, stood up for him and battled 
the Hughes executives. "I tried to tell them that Jeffery was a superstar 
employee," Villalpando said this week. "I didn't understand why they didn't 
want to promote him."  
</P>
<P>
 Villalpando said "racism was running so rampant" at the company that 
executives forced him to start a smear campaign trying to discredit Lane. Both 
men said their bosses harassed them to the point that life was unbearable at 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Villalpando broke down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cried for the first time in 14 years," he said. "It was a total emotional 
raping." 
</P>
<P>
 The two men took the case to court, and on Wednesday a Los Angeles Superior 
Court jury awarded them $89.5 million. And though there have been other 
class-action suits in which larger amounts have been awarded, this is one of 
the largest amounts involving individual plaintiffs. It is also one of the 
biggest racial bias suits in history. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time Hughes has had legal charges of racism leveled 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a black accountant at the company, who also said he was denied 
promotions because of his race, was awarded $1.4 million. A similar case 
against Hughes is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Dore, a spokesman for Hughes, said the company will not comment until 
further legal actions are completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Lane and Villalpando said they never wanted the case to reach the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never did I want to sue Hughes," Lane said. "My appeal has always been to 
resolve this thing with minimal damage." 
</P>
<P>
 Ian Herzog, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said court documents show that 
Villalpando approached top executives about dealing with the racial problems at 
Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
 "David wrote and met with the president of his division, but was given the 
cold shoulder," Herzog said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes has maintained that Lane's work ethic was the only reason for his lack 
of promotion. But Herzog said court documents showed that Hughes had given Lane 
nearly perfect reviews until he filed the internal complaint.  
</P>
<P>
 "No one had ever complained about his abilities until he filed his complaint," 
Herzog said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes also countered that Lane had a physics degree, while the company was 
predominantly a electrical engineering firm. However, Villalpando said, "We 
found out during the case that six or seven white managers at the company only 
had high school diplomas." 
</P>
<P>
 Villalpando said his boss called him in several times inquiring about Lane, 
even when he was no longer Lane's supervisor. "He started making threats about 
me being able to feed my family," Villalpando said. "He also basically offered 
me a promotion to write a bad review." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lane and Villalpando said it was a daily struggle to keep their jobs and feed 
their families while maintaining their sanity at work. "They punished me 
psychologically for months because I would not give Jeffery a reprimand," 
Villalpando said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the large judgment, which is being appealed by Hughes, the two men are 
still feeling the effects of their three-year ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Villalpando, though working again, is struggling to regain control of his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "My life has been so consumed by this case that my wife and children don't 
even know who I am," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Villalpando was offered a job as a manager at his new job. He 
declined, saying: "I never want to be a manager of anybody again after what I 
went through." 
</P>
<P>
 Lane is now disabled by chronic fatigue syndrome and Epstein-Barr virus that 
he says is the result of the turmoil at Hughes. Lane takes medication to deal 
with his health problems and helps his wife with a home courier service, which 
she started to feed the family after Lane left Hughes. Other than that, he does 
not work. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane said he has learned an important lesson from the whole situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got the sense that the glass ceiling is a concrete ceiling for African 
Americans," Lane said.

STUDY URGES IMPROVED CONDITIONS FOR JURORS; LEGAL SYSTEM: A SPECIAL COUNTY 
PANEL SAYS TREATMENT IS SHABBY AT COURTHOUSES. THE REPORT PREDICTS THAT UNLESS 
REFORMS ARE MADE, FEWER PEOPLE WILL SERVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a five-month study, a special Los Angeles County commission has 
concluded that jurors in the Superior Court are treated so shoddily that an 
immediate overhaul of the system must be undertaken to deter further decline. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 42-page draft report, the county Economy and Efficiency Commission found 
that jurors "have the lowest priority in the judicial system when it comes to 
concern for their treatment and funding for their services and facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 It said, "All too often jury service in Los Angeles County . . . is 
characterized by . . . frustration, wasted time, uncomfortable and unattractive 
facilities, a lack of information to adequately understand the process and the 
failure to recognize the sacrifices involved in the performance of jury 
service." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps not surprisingly, the commission launched its study after several 
members had recently served on jury duty. "Each expressed concern about the 
treatment of citizens (called for jury duty)," the report stated. 
</P>
<P>
 But while jury service has lately become the butt of jokes, the commission 
concluded that poor treatment of jurors is becoming a serious problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The courts . . . must ensure that anyone performing such a service is treated 
with the utmost respect and is provided adequate facilities to fulfill his/her 
responsibilities," the report concluded. "Without such appreciation, fewer and 
fewer citizens will be willing to perform such service to the ultimate 
detriment of the justice system." 
</P>
<P>
 In preparing the report, the commission staff drew on studies done by other 
jurisdictions and professional organizations, such as the American Bar Assn. 
and the National Center for State Courts. Staffers also interviewed court 
officials in counties around the state and across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's report, which is scheduled for final approval next week, 
offered 45 recommendations to improve the jury system. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations ranged from public relations efforts to improve the image 
of jury service, to providing child care at the courthouses, improving pay for 
jurors, allowing jurors to pick the court where they wish to serve and scaling 
back the number of times a citizen can be called for service to once every four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The list suggests improving directions for jurors on how to find the 
courthouses and parking lots and to "repair or replace the water supply 
equipment . . . to ensure acceptable drinking water to jurors." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the recommendations could be costly to implement and the commission 
has suggested funding sources, including seeking "civic-minded companies to 
assist in upgrading jury facilities." Another recommendation encourages the use 
of welfare recipients to help with maintenance and repair of facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems of jury service appear so deep-seated that the commission has 
recommended adoption of a "jurors' bill of rights" to define the rights and 
responsibilities of jurors.. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the basic rights advocated by the commission: "that jurors are to be 
treated at all times with courtesy and respect by judges, attorneys and court 
personnel." 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioners found something else they say can really improve the 
experience for most citizens: to actually sit on a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "Courts have found that citizens who actually serve on a jury are far more 
likely to find the experience a satisfying exercise of one of their civic 
responsibilities," the report said.

 Some crime-weary Hawthorne residents think Mayor Larry Guidi was just living 
up to his city's motto -- "City of Good Neighbors" -- when he fired a warning 
shot from a 9-millimeter pistol into the air to deter three juveniles who were 
allegedly breaking into a neighbor's car. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Hawthorne police aren't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a right as a citizen to detain criminals," Hawthorne Police Capt. 
Richard Prentice said. "But if you aren't trained for it, you may wind up 
hurting somebody else or hurting yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured. Prentice said the results of a continuing Hawthorne police 
investigation of the shooting will be routinely turned over to the district 
attorney's office for review. 
</P>
<P>
 Guidi, meanwhile, isn't talking about the Thursday night incident. When 
approached outside his home by a Times reporter, Guidi turned and ran into the 
house. He later summoned Hawthorne police to remove the reporter from his 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, the incident began shortly after 9 p.m. Thursday when 
Guidi heard what sounded like a car break-in outside his home in the 4500 block 
of 133rd Street in Hawthorne. Armed with a pistol, Guidi, 35, apparently went 
out to investigate and discovered a car burglary in progress two houses away.  
</P>
<P>
 "He found some people breaking into a neighbor's car," Prentice said. "He was 
trying to hold them at gunpoint. At some point he got frightened and fired one 
shot into the air and (the alleged car burglars) ran" to their car and drove 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 A short time later, Hawthorne police responding to a 911 call detained three 
Inglewood youths, ages 14, 16 and 17, riding in a Volkswagen a few blocks away. 
The three youths were arrested on suspicion of attempted auto theft and car 
burglary and later released to their parents. Their names were not released. 
</P>
<P>
 Although discharging a firearm within the city limits is a misdemeanor, police 
said such a charge is not filed if the shooting is justified; for example, if a 
person was shooting to protect his life or the lives of others. If Guidi 
suddenly felt physically threatened by the youths, Prentice said, firing his 
weapon would probably be legally justified. However, firing a weapon solely to 
protect property is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the possibility that a stray or falling bullet could hit someone, 
Hawthorne police, like most officers, are not permitted to fire warning shots. 
Hawthorne police said they received no reports of any injuries or property 
damage caused by a stray or falling bullet Thursday evening.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said Guidi's pistol, which they have temporarily seized as evidence, 
was legally registered. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Guidi's neighbors said they believe the mayor was justified in his 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to be extremely careful about suspicious people and things around 
here," said a woman who lives next door to Guidi but did not want to be 
identified by name. She said the neighborhood has been hit by a rash of car 
thefts and burglaries in recent years, including, she said, a burglary of 
Guidi's car. 
</P>
<P>
 Guidi "is not a raving lunatic or anything," said neighbor Bryan Westmoreland, 
19, who was not at home when the incident occurred. "He's a nice guy. I would 
trust his judgment. If he fired (a shot) I would guess it was justified." 
</P>
<P>
 Married and the father of four daughters, Guidi was elected mayor in 1993 
after serving two years as a city councilman. An import-export company 
executive, he is host of a government access cable TV show called "A Taste of 
Hawthorne."

PROP. 187 YOUTH PROTEST TURNS TENSE; ACTIVISM: MULTI-AGENCY POLICE FORCE EXERTS 
TIGHT CONTROL OF STUDENTS' MOVEMENT. THE MOOD IS COOPERATIVE UNTIL THE TIME 
COMES TO LEAVE PLAZA PARK.

<P>
 The march was about to begin. And the school district had finally given up 
hopes of stopping it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it was time for school officials and police to worry about keeping things 
under control. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes after 9 a.m. Friday, the words crackled over the walkie-talkie 
of a Hueneme High School campus supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to march along J Street," an unnamed school official said. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the school bell rang minutes later and teen-agers poured out of their 
classes, the supervisor, who gave only the name Esther, knew what to expect. 
She stood by the wide-open school gate and waited. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the school, at least half a dozen police in squad cars and on 
motorcycles waited, too. 
</P>
<P>
 But for a few minutes, students seemed unsure about whether to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 All week teachers and school officials had been visiting classrooms and 
broadcasting messages over the intercom warning that any student who joined the 
demonstration would face punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the school gate was open. What was going on? 
</P>
<P>
 One boy walked shyly up to Esther. "They aren't going to do nothing to us?" he 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," she said gently. "That's why the gates are open. You can go out this 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 And within minutes they were gone. More than 300 students marched out, 
hoisting signs exhorting "No on 187" and unfurling flags of Mexico and the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 As the students walked down J Street toward the downtown park to meet hundreds 
of youths from other schools, Oxnard police squad cars and motorcycles rode 
ahead, alongside and behind them, keeping the students safe from traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're moving the right way," one officer said over a loudspeaker to the 
students as they crossed an intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Another officer pleaded: "You guys, stay on the sidewalk." 
</P>
<P>
 All together, 93 officers from the California Highway Patrol, the Oxnard 
police and Ventura County sheriff's departments joined the effort that was 
coordinated by Oxnard Police Chief Harold Hurtt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message we sent was to keep the marchers on the sidewalks, and just guide 
them to Plaza Park," Hurtt said later. "Our purpose was to get them there and 
get them there safely." 
</P>
<P>
 As each group of marchers arrived at the park, they were greeted with cheers 
by the students already there. Eventually, the numbers swelled to about 1,200 
students and several hundred other protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 While some students hung out along the edges of the park, most moved toward 
the middle to join a student-led rally blasting Proposition 187. Several school 
employees videotaped the students, planning to use the tapes to identify those 
who had left the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the police circled the park. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen sheriff's deputies on horseback formed a line on one side of the park, 
and police in riot gear, on motorcycles and inside squad cars were on the other 
streets. When some stragglers from the protest tried to leave, officers kept 
them there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our plan once we got them to Plaza Park was to get them contained, and either 
get them onto buses or let them go back the way they came," Hurtt said. "We put 
a horseshoe (of officers) on the north, south and east ends of the park so they 
could only go west." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the police either failed to communicate this plan to student organizers or 
the leaders ignored it. 
</P>
<P>
 When the crowd began to get restless after the 90-minute rally, Oxnard College 
student Lorenzo Zwaal warned the students not to board the fleet of yellow 
buses parked nearby. School officials would take pictures of students boarding 
the buses to identify them for future punishment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zwaal and other organizers tried to lead the crowd to march down Oxnard 
Boulevard. But they were met by the line of mounted deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Students turned around and headed the other way. But instead of going straight 
west down 5th Street as police had hoped, a stream of youths cut through the 
middle of a line of riot-helmeted officers, climbed over cars and walked 
through a parking lot to C Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers quickly changed their game plan, as deputies on horseback and police 
in squad cars raced to catch up to the marchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood between the students and officers suddenly changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of calling out friendly reminders for students to march on the 
sidewalk, the officers barked directions. 
</P>
<P>
 When mounted deputies broke up a scuffle among a few boys, the officers 
grabbed two of the boys by their shirts and held them, dragging them a few feet 
as the horses moved back from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This sparked an outcry from the students, who angrily threw paper flyers -- 
the only weapons they had -- at the officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The tension broke as the crowd slowly dispersed. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said most of the protesters returned to their schools by the 
end of the day. And when the students walked off the streets and back to their 
campuses, the role of the police ended and the district took control again. 
</P>
<P>
 Through videotapes, photographs and lists of the names of students who 
returned to school, school officials hope to identify and punish all of the 
youths who walked out.

ELECTIONS / 35TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT; FIRESTONE'S SPENDING TOPS LORENZ'S BY A BIG 
MARGIN 
</P>

 Republican Brooks Firestone spent more than $260,000 in the past month on his 
campaign for the state Assembly, nearly matching the amount his Democratic 
opponent Mindy Lorenz has spent in the entire campaign, according to new 
finance reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates are competing in a hotly contested race for an open seat in 
the 35th Assembly District, which includes Ventura, Santa Paula, Ojai and most 
of Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've shot everything into this," Firestone said of his expenditures for the 
past month, adding that the money went to pay for a slew of campaign mailers as 
well as television and radio ads. Firestone has spent $566,800 on the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Lorenz has raised a total of $307,000, and spent $265,400, 
according to her most recent finance statement. The deadline for candidates to 
file their most recent campaign finance reports was Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz said she was pleased with the amount of money she had been able to 
raise, pointing out that Firestone, the grandson of the founder of Firestone 
Tire & Rubber Co., and his family had contributed $150,000 to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal has never been to out-raise Brooks Firestone, my goal has been to 
raise enough money to win the race," said Lorenz, an art history professor. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates have received hefty contributions from their respective 
political parties, with the bulk of the money flowing into their campaign war 
chests during October. Firestone has received a total of $53,000 in cash 
contributions from the GOP, and Lorenz received $51,300 from the Democratic 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Firestone also received $30,000 from the Tort Reform Advisory 
Committee, $5,000 from the Assn. of California Insurance Companies, and $2,000 
from Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz's contributions during the same period included $5,000 from musician 
Don Henley, $2,000 from Laborers for Equality and Progress, and $1,000 from the 
Faculty Assn. of Community Colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates have papered the district with slick campaign mailers that 
have blasted each other's personal and political histories. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Firestone has distributed hard-hitting mailers to voters 
calling attention to Lorenz's history of switching political parties. One flyer 
featured a photo of a color-changing lizard on the cover meant to represent 
Lorenz, another accused her of supporting the legalization of cocaine and 
heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I've said has been factual," Firestone said. "I'm saying that as a 
political activist, these have been her views. And I think that's relevant." 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz said Firestone has distorted her political history, and that his 
accusation that she favors legalizing drugs is absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brooks Firestone has set a new low for state races in this area," she said. 
"And I think it's going to have a backlash effect." 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz's flyers and television ads, on the other hand, have accused Firestone 
of trying to buy the race with his family's money. 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone dismissed Lorenz's accusations as "nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
 In the state's 18th Senate District, Assemblyman Jack O'Connell 
(D-Carpinteria) reported raising a total of $1.1 million, while spending 
$973,300 on his campaign. In contrast, his Republican opponent, Steve 
MacElvaine, a former San Luis Obispo County supervisor, raised $458,000 and 
spent $357,800. 
</P>
<P>
 The district includes the same areas as the 35th Assembly District, but also 
stretches into San Luis Obispo County.

CITY TO CONSIDER ANNEXATION OF WELDON SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After years of watching a proposal for a Weldon Canyon landfill flourish, then 
die, then resurrect itself again, Ventura officials are considering ending the 
controversy by annexing the nearby gorge. 
</P>
<P>
 "One positive is it gives the city more control over whether we're going to 
have the landfill," said Councilman Steve Bennett, an avowed environmentalist 
who has long fought the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6,474-acre canyon lies 2 1/2 miles north of Ventura and five miles south 
of Ojai. The notion of placing a landfill there has loomed for the past decade, 
though it appeared to die last year when Waste Management Inc. withdrew its 
plan in the face of probable defeat before the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 A San Diego partnership, Taconic Resources, revived the idea with a petition 
drive this spring. Proponents collected enough signatures to qualify the 
initiative for the November ballot, but the measure was removed in August after 
a judge declared it illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes the proposal that Ventura annex the canyon, suggested by a 
consultant this week at a meeting of the council's environment committee. The 
concept sparked the interest of two of the three council members on the 
committee, who asked city staff to research the concept and report back in 
December.  
</P>
<P>
 If the city seeks to lay claim to the canyon, the site's future would be at 
the mercy of the Ventura City Council, which has consistently opposed the idea 
of a dump just a few miles out of town.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite their opposition to the dump, a majority of the council members say 
they are wary of taking such a momentous step. Because the canyon is a few 
miles outside the city boundaries, Ventura would also have to annex a slew of 
unincorporated homes and industrial sites in between, many of whose owners have 
opposed annexation in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Bob McClenny, who lives in the Valley Vista tract, which may be 
included in an annexation, said the threat of a nearby dump is not reason 
enough for him to want to be a part of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd just as soon not, I think," said McClenny, who has lived on Cypress Lane 
for 20 years. "I'd just as soon stay county because the taxes are cheaper."  
</P>
<P>
 Even if property owners liked the idea, the cost of providing services to the 
new residents might far outweigh any added property tax revenue the city would 
receive, some council members said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a very expensive proposition," Councilman Jack Tingstrom said. "It 
would have to be looked at very hard." 
</P>
<P>
 But landfill supporters and opponents alike said they could see why annexing 
Weldon Canyon would appeal to Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were a member of the council in Ventura, I would probably favor it," 
said Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez, noting that the Bailard Landfill, which is just 
outside of Oxnard, has been a thorn in the city's side for many years. "(Oxnard 
officials) were in favor of (the Weldon Canyon landfill) because . . . we felt 
that turnabout was fair play. But this (annexation) would get Ventura in 
control."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai City Councilwoman Nina Shelley, a tenacious opponent of the landfill, 
hailed the annexation concept as a great proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sort of came out of the blue, but I just think it's a splendid idea," she 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Ventura will need the permission of the Local Agency Formation Commission -- a 
state agency that deals with annexation issues -- for each step of the 
annexation process. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob McKinney, a LAFCO board member and an Ojai city councilman, said the 
proposal caught his fancy. "Gee, that's intriguing," he said. "I'd like to 
pursue that."  
</P>
<P>
 After determining whether the city can afford the annexation, Ventura would 
next need to apply to LAFCO to expand its sphere of influence to include Weldon 
Canyon. A sphere of influence is the land around a city that LAFCO has 
designated as a likely area for the city to expand. The canyon lies just 
outside the city's current sphere of influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Only when all the land in question was included in the sphere could Ventura 
try to annex the property. And even then, officials warn, the city faces a host 
of environmental, political and legal complications. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very volatile issue," Steve Chase, Ventura's environmental affairs 
coordinator, told the council's environment committee this week. "If there's 
not a predisposition here to use policy issues to make land-use decisions, then 
let's not go down that path now."

RANCHER AND PARTNERS TOLD TO RESTORE WILDLIFE HABITAT NEAR CAMARILLO; 
ENVIRONMENT: EPA SAYS WETLAND WAS DESTROYED TO ACCOMMODATE A VEGETABLE FARM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rancher Craig Underwood and his business partners must restore the sizable 
wildlife habitat destroyed when they converted a swampy lot into a 60-acre 
vegetable farm just outside Camarillo, federal officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Biologists from the Environmental Protection Agency have determined that 
Underwood Ranches destroyed 23 acres of wetland when they clear-cut, drained 
and leveled the field in the summer of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very, very nice wetland out there," EPA biologist Aaron Setran said, 
describing a field choked with cattails, rushes and willow trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA has ordered the farmers to either restore part of their field to its 
natural state or to enhance an existing wetland elsewhere in the county. 
Biologists have not determined how many acres Underwood would need to restore. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, the Underwood partners have not decided whether to challenge 
the EPA's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Underwood said he would review the EPA's technical data, amassed during a 
six-month investigation, before determining his next step. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to look at all the options and try to resolve this so it's good 
for them and it's good for us," Underwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 Underwood's farm, known as Conejo Ranch, has been the subject of a series of 
articles in The Times over the past year. Called "60 Acres of Hope," the series 
describes a year in the life of a farm. 
</P>
<P>
 The first article in the series attracted the attention of environmental 
regulators from the Army Corps of Engineers. They brought the case to the EPA, 
launching the federal probe. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation took the partners by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 When Underwood, Jim Roberts and Minos Athanassiadis bought the field for 
$420,000 in the spring of 1993, they knew it was overgrown and soggy. But they 
never considered the parcel a wetland. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the field had been dedicated to agricultural use for more than a 
century, first as a cattle pasture and then as a tomato and broccoli farm. The 
weeds and plants started sprouting only in the late 1980s, when the land lay 
idle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence we have received to date indicates that the property is not a 
regulated wetland," said the partners' attorney, Curt Uritz. 
</P>
<P>
 Before touching the soil, the partners hired a consultant to obtain permits 
from local agencies, including the county flood control district.  
</P>
<P>
 But no one checked with the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Clean Water Act, landowners must obtain federal permits before 
tampering with any wetlands. Suspecting a violation, EPA investigators came up 
with aerial photos of the field taken before farmers began working the soil. 
The old photos proved that a broad swath of the field had once harbored a 
flourishing wetland, Setran said. And soil samples confirmed that the field 
tended to collect pools of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Underwoods' own photos, snapped with pride during the first days of 
work on the new field, showed bulldozers churning up stands of cattails and 
willows, Setran said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the photos, biologists at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service drew up 
a list of several dozen species that may have nested in the one-time wetland. 
Warblers, hawks, turtles, even coyotes and bobcats may have lived in the field, 
which nudges up to the foothills that form the Conejo Grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disappointing to lose it," Fish and Wildlife biologist Doug Laye said. 
"We often deal with much smaller wetland areas -- two to three acres here and 
there -- and we consider them to be very important. To have 23 acres of 
riparian area -- that's certainly a large chunk." 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that the farmers did not knowingly destroy a wetland, the EPA will 
not press criminal charges, Setran said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the alternative punishment will be costly. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental consultant Pam Lindsey, who has guided several wetland 
restorations in Ventura County, estimated that the project could cost more than 
$2,000 an acre. 
</P>
<P>
 On-site mitigation would probably be cheaper -- but would require the farmers 
to rip up part of their field, now planted with baby carrots. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If they decide to enhance wetlands outside their ranch, the farmers might have 
to cover more territory. Regulators frequently require improvements to two 
acres of existing wetland for every one acre that was destroyed, Lindsey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical mitigation projects involve ripping out noxious weeds, such as giant 
bamboo, and planting native species in fragile wetlands. The farmers would pay 
for that work and for monitoring the site for five years, Lindsey said. 
</P>
<P>
 But she emphasized that "there are no rules -- it all depends on negotiations" 
between the farmers and federal officials. "They sort of create the punishment 
to fit the crime," said Lindsey, a biologist at Impact Sciences Inc. in 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 As he prepares to begin negotiating, the EPA's Setran said he believed his 
agency would be able to work out a fair deal, especially if the farmers 
continue to cooperate. "I can't imagine the cost being astronomical," he said.

 The 5-4 Ballroom and Supper Club, a historic jazz club considered by some to 
be the Apollo Theater of South-Central Los Angeles, reopened Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The club, a cultural landmark that originally featured big bands, was built in 
1922. 
</P>
<P>
 The club had been idle for 25 years until Oliver W. Wilson, a professor in the 
department of political science at Cal State Dominguez Hills, bought it in 1980 
and began the restoration project.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY: MOORPARK; MONTGOMERY OWES $2,545, DMV SAYS 
</P>

 The state Department of Motor Vehicles is taking steps to collect $2,545 in 
vehicle registration fees and penalties from Ventura County supervisorial 
candidate Scott Montgomery, who has failed to pay the debt for nearly two 
years, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our records show that it has not been paid," said Evan Nossoff, a department 
spokesman. He said Montgomery owed the fees for driving a vehicle with expired 
license plates. 
</P>
<P>
 But Montgomery said he is not responsible for the debt and plans to appeal the 
case. He added that the 1989 Ford Bronco in question is properly registered to 
his wife, Patricia. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife acquired it from my mother-in-law (a Michigan resident), so if there 
are any fees, they are attributable to her," Montgomery said. "We don't feel 
responsible for someone else's debt." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nossoff said both Montgomery and his wife are responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have made representation to us that they do not owe the money," he said. 
"We believe they owe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said he could not recall ever being notified by the DMV or a 
private collection agency about outstanding fees or fines. "This was unknown to 
us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nossoff said his office mailed Montgomery two notices, including one dated 
Sept. 6, about the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Nossoff noted that $613 had been paid for the vehicle's current registration, 
but that does not erase include past fines and fees. If the money is not 
collected, Nossoff said the Bronco would probably be seized and sold to pay off 
the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 In early 1993, DMV officials said they began investigating Montgomery after it 
was established that he had been driving the Bronco with expired Michigan 
license plates. Investigators were told by neighbors that Montgomery had been 
driving the truck for more than a year, occasionally to City Council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said the vehicle was owned by his mother-in-law at the time, and so 
he was not responsible for any registration fees that she may have owed. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery, a Moorpark city councilman, is running for a supervisorial seat 
representing Simi Valley and Moorpark. CARLOS V. LOZANO

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; EXCESSIVE 
FORCE SUIT AGAINST LAPD ENDS IN MISTRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge declared a mistrial in an excessive-force lawsuit that 
ultimately may determine if the Los Angeles City Council helped foster a policy 
of police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts dismissed the jury when he learned that a 
key plaintiff witness was unable to testify and that another did not have 
firsthand knowledge of what she going to be asked about.  
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed on behalf of 4-year-old Johanna Trevino, stems from the 
fatal police shooting of her father, Javier, and two other men during an 
attempted robbery of a McDonald's in Sunland on Feb. 12, 1990.  
</P>
<P>
 The trial was reset for Dec. 6. It is the second mistrial within a year in the 
case.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY: THOUSAND OAKS; SIERRA CLUB BACKS 3 COUNCIL CANDIDATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Seeking environmental candidates, the Sierra Club has endorsed three 
contenders in the Thousand Oaks City Council race: incumbent Elois Zeanah, city 
Operations Manager David Hare and retired filmmaker M. Ali Issari. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Valley Sierra Club's executive committee sent questionnaires to all 
16 candidates, asking them to outline plans for improving air quality and 
transportation.The questionnaire also asked the candidates' views on preserving 
land zoned for open space. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the 16 candidates responded to the questionnaire, club member 
Cassandra Auerbach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah, Hare and Issari -- who are running together on a slow-growth slate -- 
got the nod because they will "uphold our city's General Plan and . . . expand 
the city's responsible policies on conservation and recycling," Auerbach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing such upcoming projects as a proposed golf course in Hill Canyon and a 
huge mall in Newbury Park, Auerbach said the three council members elected in 
November will face some key environmental decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah agreed, saying the election "will be telling as to whether or not we 
maintain the environmental values which make our city so unique." She added, "I 
think -- I hope -- that people will pay attention to the endorsement." 
</P>
<P>
 The other candidates who returned Sierra Club questionnaires were engineer Lee 
Laxdal, community activist Ekbal Quidwai, public access television producer 
Jeannette Scovill, Planning Commissioner Irv Wasserman and mobile carwash owner 
Lance Winslow. STEPHANIE SIMON

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; BEACH 
BOYS' SINGER TESTIFIES IN SUIT AGAINST BRIAN WILSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beach Boys lead singer Mike Love testified Friday that he was told he would 
not get proper credit for the songs he co-wrote if he failed to sign a 1969 
agreement to sell the group's 140-song catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I signed it under duress, " Love testified in Los Angeles Superior Court.Both 
the group's manager and its attorney, Abraham Somer, told him to sign the 
agreement, Love said at the end of the fourth week of testimony in his suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy began with the sale of the band's songs, known as Sea of 
Tunes, to Irving Music, a division of A & M Records. The late Murry Wilson, 
father of co-founder Brian Wilson and owner of the publishing rights, got 
$700,000 for the songs. The sale was negated in a 1992 settlement that netted 
Brian Wilson $10 million. Love, 53, sued his cousin, Brian Wilson, to obtain a 
share of royalties he claims he is owed for songs including "California Girls," 
"Dance, Dance, Dance" and "Help Me Rhonda."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY TO PAY FOR LAWYERS' EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MURPHY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County officials have backed off their insistence that the salary for 
prosecutors and public defenders not reflect the experience they gained during 
a one-year pay freeze for all county employees, attorneys said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it remains unresolved whether about 30 county attorneys must return 
money they were mistakenly paid over the past few months, in the future they 
will receive salary increases based on their full experience, said Douglas 
Daily, president of the Deputy Public Defenders Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county has substantially changed their position," Daily said. "They're 
being reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said last week that certain prosecutors and public defenders 
had circumvented a county pay freeze and received improper merit raises. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorneys reacted angrily at being told that not only were they not 
entitled to the raises, but their next permissible salary increase would not 
reflect the year of experience they gained when the freeze was in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors and public defenders are paid between $32,000 and $69,000 a year, 
depending on their years of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 County Personnel Director Ronald W. Komers, in a meeting Thursday with 
representatives of the district attorney and public defender's offices, changed 
his earlier stance, the attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Essentially, you'll be paid for your experience and you'll not be penalized 
because of the freeze," Deputy Dist. Atty. Brian S. Rafelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Komers could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The raise issue was the latest dispute between the attorneys and the county. 
This week, deputy prosecutors and public defenders voted to form their own 
union. 
</P>
<P>
 The main dispute, the attorneys say, is that they are paid substantially less 
than government attorneys in comparable counties in the state. BARBARA MURPHY

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MENENDEZ 
RETRIAL JUDGE RULES OUT SEPARATE JURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The judge in the Menendez murder trial Friday ruled out the use of separate 
juries for the brothers' retrial, saying there were too many logistic problems 
with that arrangement at the first trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg again put off a decision 
on whether the brothers will be tried separately.Weisberg said he intends to 
decide after defense attorneys tell him more about their view of certain 
evidence in a brief due Nov. 8.  
</P>
<P>
 The judge is scheduled to take up other pretrial issues on Monday, primarily 
whether Jill Lansing, Lyle Menendez's attorney for the first trial, can come 
back to the case. She resigned after the first trial, saying she wanted to 
spend more time with her family, but Lyle Menendez, 26, said recently he wants 
her back. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers face retrial in the 1989 shotgun slayings of their parents. Their 
first trial, before separate juries, ended in January with both panels 
deadlocked between murder and lesser manslaughter verdicts. Lyle and Erik 
Menendez, 23, remain in jail.

COUNCIL REJECTS HOLDEN'S BID TO MOVE SITE OF PLANNED BLACK PANTHERS MURAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council on Friday rejected an attempt by Councilman Nate 
Holden to change the location of a proposed mural depicting the Black Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 7-3 vote, the council sided with representatives of a public art program 
who said that a recommendation to move the mural would amount to censorship. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the mural depicting a gun-toting Huey Newton and other scenes of the 
black radical group will be allowed to go up on the side of a Jefferson 
Boulevard barber shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Mural artist Noni Olabisi wept after the vote. "I'm very pleased," she said, 
adding that the history of the Black Panthers is significant. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden said the depiction of Newton and other images, including a black man in 
a noose, could incite violence in his district. He asked that the council make 
a formal request to move the proposed location outside the barber shop to an 
indoor gallery -- perhaps the African-American Museum in Exposition Park or a 
city arts center in his district. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Cultural Affairs Commission had already approved the location of 
the mural, near 11th Avenue. A representative of the city attorney's office 
said Friday that only safety issues, not content, should be considered in 
locating public art.

 Making capital punishment pay: You can't accuse Assembly candidate Adam

 Michelin, a Republican seeking to unseat heavily favored Curtis Tucker Jr.

</P>
<P>
 "Any prisoner with a sentence longer than his or her life expectancy shall be 
allowed the choice of voluntary death or jail time. If death is selected, the 
prisoner will receive 10% of the present value of any estimated savings from 
not serving time, to be left to his or her estate." 
</P>
<P>
 And the state will be "required to pay the victim(s) of the crime 20% of the 
present value of any estimated savings." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed to elaborate on his proposal by a Times reporter, Michelin admitted, 
"I haven't worked out all the details on that one yet."

 Snub Pedro: A reader notes that three of the freeways branching out from the 
Downtown four-level are named for their destinations -- the Hollywood, the 
Pasadena and the Santa Ana. But the fourth, which heads for San Pedro, is 
instead named the Harbor. Snubs such as these are the reason that San Pedroites 
-- or is Pedroids? -- occasionally talk about seceding from L.A. -- and, no 
doubt, putting up "Do Not Enter" signs at their common boundary. miscelLAny 
Speaking of making a break, two of the reasons Orange County withdrew from L.A. 
County in 1889, according to the book "A Hundred Years of Yesterdays" was that 
(1) a stagecoach ride from Anaheim to the county seat in L.A. cost the 
outlandish price of $6, and (2) the county's only rolled fire hose was kept in 
L.A.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: EAVESDROP MAY BRING DISMISSAL OF CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MURPHY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A defense attorney urged a state appeals court Friday to dismiss charges 
against a Ventura burglary defendant because a prosecutor eavesdropped on the 
suspect's private conversation with his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The public defender's office is seeking the dismissal of charges against 
Robert Lee Morrow, 30, while the district attorney's office is arguing to 
continue with the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2nd District Court of Appeal took the case after a Superior Court judge 
refused to dismiss charges when it was learned that Deputy Dist. Atty. Stacy 
Ratner directed an investigator to listen in on a conversation between Morrow 
and his public defender. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dismissal is the only reasonable remedy for conduct such as occurred here," 
Deputy Public Defender Bryant Villagran said. "No one should be offended by the 
idea that Mr. Morrow might get a dismissal out of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow is accused of breaking into a Port Hueneme motel in September, 1993. 
The eavesdropping occurred when Morrow was talking with Deputy Public Defender 
Mary Fielder in a holding cell adjacent to a courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratner and the investigator, Katherine Smith, were charged with felony 
eavesdropping in May. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge later was dropped by a Superior Court judge because the pair did 
not use an electronic device to listen to Morrow's conversation with his 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Villagran said he told the judges that Ratner and Smith's conduct was so 
egregious it should result in the dismissal of charges. That is the only way to 
dissuade prosecutors from eavesdropping on future conversations between a 
defendant and his attorney, Villagran said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't rely on the good faith of the district attorney's office," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin G. DeNoce, who argued for the prosecution, could not 
be reached for comment. BARBARA MURPHY

THERE'S A HITCH; SLOW-MOVING DIVORCE COMPLICATES WEDDING PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The groom had driven all the way to Santa Clarita from Kennedy, Tex. Their new 
home was ready in Provo, Utah. A big wedding reception was planned here next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 So what could hold up the plans of Laura Molidor and James Linder to marry in 
Las Vegas this weekend? 
</P>
<P>
 To her surprise and exasperation, Molidor says, she just learned that she is 
still hitched to a man in Palmdale despite four years of efforts to get an 
uncontested divorce signed and sealed. Whether slow-moving court bureaucracy or 
a paperwork problem in Molidor's lawyer's office is to blame is the subject of 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 But as late as Friday afternoon, they were still debating whether to go ahead 
with the ceremony in Las Vegas -- relying on assurances from the same lawyer's 
office that, divorce decree or no, there are legal ways that may ensure later 
that the marriage is legal, not bigamous. "We've changed our minds at least six 
times in the last few days," Molidor said. She and Linder were alternately 
fuming and laughing about the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always said I wouldn't marry a Mormon unless I could have more than one 
husband," Molidor said in reference to Linder's religious background. "But it 
might turn out that way after all," she joked, acknowledging that she knows 
that Mormons no longer practice polygamy. 
</P>
<P>
 Molidor, 30, said she separated from her first husband four years ago and 
filed for what she thought was an uncomplicated divorce, with no financial or 
child custody disputes. After innumerable delays in getting a decree, she found 
a new lawyer, who assured her the divorce would be final in time for her to 
remarry in late October. 
</P>
<P>
 With that, she said, she finalized her wedding plans and told her beau, a 
34-year-old businessman, to wrap up things in Texas and come out. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple were frustrated this week, however, when a representative of her 
attorney informed them that there were delays because the Los Angeles Superior 
Court commissioner in San Fernando who was to sign the divorce papers had been 
on a month's vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the courts have a backlog, they just ought to do a little overtime," she 
said. Linder ruefully noted that his previous wife was granted a divorce from 
him only three weeks after she filed. 
</P>
<P>
 But a court clerk said Friday that Molidor's petition was not submitted until 
Sept. 26, and then was rejected in mid-October because the papers were 
incorrectly prepared -- a glitch Molidor apparently did not know about. New 
papers from the attorney were received Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney, James Reape of Santa Clarita, did not return phone calls seeking 
comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Reape's office advised them not to marry, Molidor said -- but offered her an 
"out" if she does: They could take a chance on filing a nunc pro tunc petition 
after their wedding, saying that there was good enough reason for them to 
marry, which could protect the status of the marriage, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of any weekend decision, Molidor said they planned to drive back 
Monday to Palmdale, where her current husband still lives with their two 
children. "I want to take the kids out trick-or-treating on Halloween," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Linder, who is on good terms with his fiancee's still-legal spouse, added: 
"And if we do go ahead and get married in Vegas, we two men will be sitting 
around watching "Monday Night Football," talking about our wife."

AL MARTINEZ: TO LIVE AND PLAY IN L.A.

<TEXT>
<P>
 There are probably a lot of reasons to hire a publicist, but I never thought 
that selling a house was one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been hustled by press agents promoting singers, dancers, actors, priests, 
hookers, writers, lawyers, burglars and ordinary people who just wanted to be 
better known. 
</P>
<P>
 But I had never been approached by a publicist for a house until I got a call 
from Rosalind Marmel, who opened her conversation by saying that I could be the 
next Geraldo Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that has never been a compelling ambition, I was ready to start making 
noise like there was static on the line and I couldn't hear, which would force 
me to hang up, until she mentioned a secret room. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that a stockbroker named Chris Kavanau was living in a sprawling 
hilltop house in Glendale once owned by the late Hubert Eaton, a research 
chemist who had made dying, if not fun, at least more interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 Eaton founded Forest Lawn Cemetery, a boundary of which is about 100 feet from 
the house in question. He joined his customers in eternity in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 By tapping on walls, Kavanau, who has lived there only a few months, 
discovered what he thought was a secret room. He and Marmel speculated that 
since the place had been owned by a cemeterian, it could be haunted or contain 
bodies that had never made it to more suitable surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 Kavanau was being transferred to San Diego and was trying to sell the house, 
which was why he'd hired Marmel. She no doubt said to him we have a secret 
room, Halloween is coming up, you want to sell the joint, so what we need is a 
little off-beat P.R. That's when my phone rang. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her reference to Geraldo Rivera alluded to the time in 1986 when he blasted 
open Al Capone's vault in Chicago during a live two-hour television program, 
and, amid a roar of hype, found . . . nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 As I said, I've never wanted to grow up to be Geraldo, but I am a sucker for 
hidden rooms in homes once owned by people who were in the business of death. 
If it makes me famous, so much the better. 
</P>
<P>
 So I went out to the place and was greeted by Marmel, Kavanau and a voice 
teacher from Chicago named Dan Balestrero, who had just moved to L.A. and was 
thinking of hiring Marmel as his publicist. 
</P>
<P>
 Kavanau fascinated me because he is the kind of guy who can compute in his 
head the number of light-years from here to any moving object in space but 
can't tie his own shoelaces. 
</P>
<P>
 A big, detached, red-faced man of 32, he doesn't know what his IQ is, but in 
high school he built a computer from scratch, taught advanced calculus in the 
11th grade, founded his own company in college, learned to read Japanese, 
dabbles in electronics and deciphers Egyptian hieroglyphics to relax. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he works as a stockbroker, he wants to devote his life to theoretical 
physics, but needs money to support himself. I can understand that. I've always 
wanted to open a little hardware store in Bellflower, but it will have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 On to the secret room. We all trooped to the basement in an area opposite what 
had been a chauffeur's quarters. Kavanau began tapping on the wall to the 
ghostly compartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK," Marmel declared in a manner meant to convey excitement, "let's open her 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kavanau, who perspired and got progressively redder in the face as he worked, 
chipped away with a crowbar as Balestrero sang "Danny Boy" in a rich baritone 
and Marmel took pictures with a little red dime-store camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly Geraldo in prime time, but I enjoyed the music. 
</P>
<P>
 What had intrigued Kavanau in the first place were the remnants of a hidden 
door concealing the secret room. After chipping away at a corner of the door, 
he ripped it open and, to our utter amazement, found . . . a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Still convinced there was a room back there, he brought out an electric saw to 
cut a hole in that wall and, as the piece fell away, we gasped to find . . . OH 
MY GOD! . . . another wall. 
</P>
<P>
 I could go on with this, but as it turned out that wall was the wall to the 
chauffeur's room just on the other side, which was rented to a writer who was 
away at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no secret room, only the space between two walls. Marmel, unfazed by 
the revelation, began talking about a secret basement, but my interest by then 
had dwindled to zero and I left. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope Kavanau sells the place and goes on to solve all the mysteries of the 
universe, but he's going to have to do it without me. When I got home that 
night, my wife, Cinelli, asked, "What've you been doing all day?" I said, 
"Nothing," and I meant it. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all yours, Geraldo.

DELAYED DOWNTOWN PARK MAKES QUIET DEBUT; CITY LIFE: AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF SNAGS 
AND A BUILDER'S BANKRUPTCY, $20-MILLION EXPANSE OF URBAN GREENERY OPENS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven years after its groundbreaking, the much-delayed Grand Hope Park in 
Downtown Los Angeles opened without fanfare this week, but with the 
controversial wrought-iron fence and gates designed to protect the $20-million 
investment in property, landscaping and artwork. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took a lot longer than anybody expected. It took a lot longer than anybody 
wanted," said Don Spivack, an official with the city Community Redevelopment 
Agency. CRA money built the 2.5-acre park, which will be run by a private group 
of nearby property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Bounded by Grand Avenue, Hope and 9th streets and Olympic Boulevard, the park 
is supposed to spur redevelopment of Downtown's southern district and be a 
model for private management of public facilities. Among its features are a 
53-foot-high clock tower, a fountain shaped like a snake, a colorful playground 
and a grassy slope decorated with coyote statues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great," said Zul Ahmed, a software developer who works nearby 
and was eating lunch with a friend on a park bench Friday. "When you are 
working on a stressful job, this is a good place to come and relax. Otherwise, 
you are cooped up in a concrete jungle." 
</P>
<P>
 He and most of the dozen or so other lunchtime visitors praised the 
eight-foot-high wrought-iron fence, which has 14 entrances open during the day. 
Los Angeles Councilwoman Rita Walters, who represents the area, unsuccessfully 
opposed adding the $179,000 fence last year, saying it would project an image 
of exclusion.  
</P>
<P>
 Michael Raichandani, who works in the adjacent Fashion Institute of Design and 
Merchandising, said the fence makes him feel safer in Grand Hope. "The park is 
big enough so you don't feel closed in." 
</P>
<P>
 Walters still wishes the fence hadn't been built, her planning deputy, John 
Sheppard, said. However, Sheppard conceded that the fence, designed by park 
architect Lawrence Halprin, "looks better than I imagined it would look like. 
It's not as imposing as I thought it would be." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fence construction, to ward off vandalism and graffiti, was just one cause 
for the much-belated opening. A more serious problem, officials said, arose 
when the park's builder declared bankruptcy two years ago when the oasis was 
nearly complete. Financial problems at the recently finished Renaissance Tower 
apartment building, on the park's south end, also hurt because the park was 
being used as a staging area for that delayed construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long time coming, and now it's wonderful to see the kids in the 
playground," said Annie D. Johnson, vice president of the fashion school and 
president of Grand Hope Park Inc., the nonprofit organization that will run the 
park under a 50-year lease with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The school, Renaissance Tower, the Metropolitan Apartments across Hope Street 
and a nearby office tower are to pay a total of $155,000 annually toward the 
park's $250,000 maintenance budget, Johnson said. To make up the difference, 
the CRA is to pay a maximum of $110,000 a year, capped at $880,000, until other 
planned building projects in the South Park neighborhood rise from recessionary 
limbo and can contribute funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, several dedication and groundbreaking parties were held 
prematurely, causing what the CRA's Spivack called "a little embarrassment." 
This week, there were no speeches, no ceremonies, just the sound of lunch bags 
opening.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; TASK FORCE, MAYOR DISCUSS YOUTH EVENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA E. STOLL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura Mayor Tom Buford was trying to figure out a way for teen-agers from 
all over the city to get together and have a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had a co-ed softball tournament, would kids come?" Buford asked a crowd 
of teen-agers and city officials gathered in city hall Thursday. "Does co-ed 
make sense?" 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first meeting of the Ventura Youth Task Force, and the mayor was 
hard at work, applying the resources of the city government to a new challenge. 
A departure from the usual fare of development proposals, street repairs and 
utility rate increases, the Youth Task Force is a chance for the city to serve 
constituents who are mostly too young to vote or pay property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Buford was participating in a brainstorming session, helping members of the 
task force dream up an event that would be their first tangible achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers and adults on the task force threw out a host of suggestions, 
including the softball tournament, an outdoor dance, a youth conference, an 
arts festival and a maritime-themed event at the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 A subcommittee on "strategic planning" suggested developing a vision for the 
task force, which includes students, City Council members, police, city staff 
members and representatives from nonprofit organizations and social service 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Another subcommittee, charged with an "assessment of needs and resources," 
decided to survey the city's youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Task force member Mike Forrest, a senior at Buena High School and president of 
student government there, acknowledged that there was "a lot of bureaucracy 
enveloping the task force, which spawned three subcommittees at its very first 
meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 "We just need to focus," Forrest said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, students said they were optimistic about the chances for the task force 
to overcome the bureaucracy and produce results. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidel Morales, 20, a staff member at the Westpark Recreation Center, said he 
thought a citywide street festival for youth, perhaps including an evening 
dance, is a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like something a lot of people would be interested in. I think it 
will be done," Morales said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers said that while some might see it as a waste for the city to throw 
a big party for kids, an event is needed to bring youths from different 
neighborhoods together and get their attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they see that we're doing something fun, that will get people interested," 
St. Bonaventure High School senior Amber Iwasiuk said. Then, she said, students 
could be drawn into more serious task force programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force first met in September as the Youth Issues Discussion Group.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; RECALL PETITION DRIVE COULD BEGIN SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As early as this weekend, Ventura residents could begin circulating petitions 
to recall Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures, a resident who is organizing the 
recall drive said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 East county homeowner Elaina Fletcher in August began her effort to oust 
Measures from office, claiming the council member abused the public trust by 
backing a development proposal by friend and business associate Ron Hertel. 
</P>
<P>
 Hertel wanted to give the city 94 acres south of California 126 and $2 million 
toward building a regional park at the site, in exchange for permission to 
build 437 residences on a city-owned lemon orchard at Telegraph Road and Petit 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures supported the proposal, but later found she had a conflict of 
interest because she owned a share in property situated within 2,500 feet of 
the proposed park site. 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher argues that Measures should not have lobbied for Hertel's park-swap 
proposal because of the conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher said she is relieved to finally have the petitions approved by the 
city clerk. She said she and other residents will begin circulating the 
petitions by mid-week at the latest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real work starts now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher has up to 160 days to collect 8,589 signatures -- the amount needed 
to call a special election on the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures was not available for comment. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; REQUEST FOR VETERANS HOME IS REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A veterans convalescent home and the 400 jobs that come with it will not be 
opening in Ventura any time soon, a state task force decided this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with competing proposals from city officials and a local developer, a 
governor's task force on veterans nursing homes, meeting in Santa Ana on 
Thursday, agreed that Ventura should not receive one of the much-coveted 
convalescent facilities until the city irons out its internal divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The 400-bed facility would have been paid for with state and federal funds and 
would have brought as many as 400 jobs to Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the task force recommended to Gov. Pete Wilson that nursing homes be 
built in Chula Vista and Lancaster. The commission will meet again in January, 
when it will again consider Ventura and other Southern California communities 
for one last facility, to be built within the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given all the things we need to do to make one of these facilities happen, we 
were reluctant to get in the middle of something where it seems like the 
community doesn't have a unified approach," said Michael Kilbane, a spokesman 
for the task force. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has worked for months promoting a deal whereby 
Wittenberg-Livingston, a Newport Beach developer, would donate 22 acres for the 
veterans home in return for permission to build homes on the rest of its 
62-acre site in east Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 But a local group of Chumash Indians oppose building on the site because it is 
near a Chumash burial ground. The group attended the meeting in Santa Ana and 
told the commissioners of its concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, local developer Rudy Contreras presented a proposal to put the 
home on his land on Olivas Park Drive, just outside the city limits. The 
council opposes using that site because it is zoned for agricultural use. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Buford said he was disappointed by the commission's decision but 
that he would work on smoothing out the community's divisions so Ventura would 
be eligible for the next round of selections. CONSTANCE SOMMER

VANGUARD PRIEST TEMPERS HIS RADICALISM; EPISCOPAL CHURCH: THE REV. MALCOLM BOYD 
CONTINUES HIS FIGHT FOR BETTER ACCEPTANCE OF GAYS. HE ALSO SPEAKS OF PATIENCE 
AND THE NEED FOR SPIRITUALITY. 
</P>

<P>
 The Rev. Malcolm Boyd, author and gay priest, stood near the altar in his 
white vestments and long, narrow green stole. Smiling warmly at the 
congregation, he began to speak of a chance encounter with a woman during a 
cruise to Catalina. 
</P>
<P>
 She had a broad, plain face. Her smile was engaging, magnetic. "It was her 
attitude that drew me to her. It was remarkably kind, trusting and giving," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Boyd, who has for so long been identified with the cause of gay rights, 
exhorted parishioners of St. Augustine's By-the-Sea Episcopal Church in Santa 
Monica to admit others into their lives -- without preconditions and judgments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope our face says you are accepted . . . and reveals the wonderful secret 
that our love of self -- rooted in God's love for us -- is unconditional, too," 
he said as he closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am accepted! We are accepted!" he declared, sounding like the radical 
priest of years back. 
</P>
<P>
 For Boyd, who has spent two decades fighting for acceptance as an openly gay 
priest, it was both a statement of fact and a shout of defiance. He has been in 
the vanguard of efforts to strike down prohibitions against ordaining gays and 
he continues to question those who insist upon celibacy for all but married 
clergy. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, as Boyd approaches the 40th anniversary of his ordination next year, what 
is most striking about his radicalism is how it has been tempered by age and 
what he describes as his pilgrimage. In the deep recesses of his being, Boyd 
has mellowed. He speaks of patience and the need for spirituality. He stares at 
death.  
</P>
<P>
 Balding and graying, Boyd, 71, finds himself increasingly confronting 
mortality -- his own, his 96-year-old mother's, and that of his "life partner" 
of the past 10 years, author and editor Mark Thompson. Thompson is healthy but 
has the virus that causes AIDS. Boyd is HIV-negative. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means that I've had a great deal to work through -- a great deal (still) 
to work through," Boyd said in a recent interview at his book-lined Silver Lake 
bungalow. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dark hours before dawn, Boyd entreats the divine. There are long 
stretches of prayer and meditation when, he said, he is consciously with God. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's insights more than visions. It's not verbal. You're not sitting there 
dictating to God and God isn't speaking to you through an echo chamber. . . . I 
don't know anything quite like it and do find it enormously comforting," Boyd 
said. "To me, it's linked with mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of a very deep meditation that extends (beyond) mortality because 
I'm aware I'll still be doing the same thing after I die," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These insights seem to have tempered his thinking about the urgency of 
temporal causes. He is untroubled by the fact that many in the church still 
refuse to accept him. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason why all this has to be resolved in a matter of weeks, 
months, years or decades," said Boyd, who wrote the 1965 bestseller "Are You 
Running With Me, Jesus?" "I do believe our life with God is an eternal life and 
there's an eternity in which to work these things out." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends see the change. 
</P>
<P>
 "He used to be a severe activist. He was very much against the Establishment 
and now has grown more appreciative of what the Establishment's been doing," 
said Jack Plimpton, who has known Boyd for 25 years and is now executive 
director of the Bishop's Commission on AIDS Ministries of the Episcopal Diocese 
of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want anything more to do with masks," Boyd told the Chicago Sun-Times 
in 1976 when he announced his sexual orientation amid anguished cries for his 
removal from the priesthood. "I'm tired now with all the preoccupation with 
public relations packaging," he said. "I'm tired of politicians and churchmen 
who are liars and hypocrites." 
</P>
<P>
 This was the radical priest who 29 years ago joined the civil rights march in 
Selma, Ala., with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and, on another occasion, was 
beaten by police in Alabama because he was found riding in a car with an 
African American. It has been 26 years since his arrest on the steps of the 
Pentagon during a Vietnam War protest where he celebrated the Eucharist -- the 
Lord's Supper. 
</P>
<P>
 In those years Boyd had written 24 books. He counted among his friends Henri 
Perrin, the French worker-priest; writer and social reformer Dorothy Day, who 
founded the Catholic Worker movement, and the late Trappist monk and writer 
Thomas Merton, who helped set a trend toward intellectual liberalism and was 
attuned with the peace and civil rights movements. 
</P>
<P>
 To many in the church, Boyd remains not only a radical priest but an outlaw. 
He lives openly in a monogamous -- and non-celibate -- relationship with 
Thompson. And despite the Episcopal Church's recent refusal to endorse (or 
clearly condemn) same-sex unions, Boyd vows to continue to perform 
marriage-like ceremonies for gay men and lesbians. He has presided over about 
two dozen same-sex unions during the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd insists that he is unrelenting in his support for gay rights and the need 
for all Christian churches to affirm the dignity of gays and their 
contributions to the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church needs to be doing something in a far more militant, courageous 
way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Episcopal Church, along with virtually all Christian denominations, 
continues to struggle with bitterly divisive issues of sexual morality. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, a group of conservative Episcopal priests asked Michigan Bishop R. 
Stewart Wood Jr. to resign because he recently ordained a lesbian. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the nation's Episcopal bishops at the church's policy-making 
General Convention rejected a proposed pastoral letter on human sexuality that 
would have opened the door, some say, to the official blessing of same-sex 
unions. Instead, after protests from 101 active and retired bishops, they 
called for more dialogue and study. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite Boyd's high profile as a gay priest, the vast majority of gays in 
the clergy remain in the closet because few congregations would have them if 
their sexual orientation were made public, Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 He began dealing seriously with his sexual orientation in graduate school when 
he was about 30. He did not "come out" until he was 53. Early in his life in 
the church, Boyd said, he had no stake in homosexual issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in a great deal of denial because my view of homosexuality was so 
terrible at that point," Boyd said. "My self-esteem was probably quite low and 
both the church and society gave you such terrible images of it (homosexuality) 
that in a way you had to say I couldn't possibly be that." 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, he said, he still carries "tremendous scars . . . and 
woundedness." 
</P>
<P>
 His family was "dysfunctional." He said his father was an alcoholic and a 
womanizer. His parents' marriage collapsed in divorce. "I'd get a box at 
Christmas with clothes that didn't fit and I wouldn't be caught dead in. I'd 
get a book that I didn't want to read -- and here was this sincere, earnest, 
struggling man doing his best," Boyd said of his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "When my father died, I was a young priest and I realized the last thing I 
could do for him was to conduct his funeral. We'd had an opportunity to get to 
know each other and I really loved him. I was able to forgive, whatever that 
means." 
</P>
<P>
 A sense of humor helps, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Marni Schneider, associate rector at St. Edmund's Episcopal Church in 
San Marino, said she learned early about Boyd's ability to laugh at himself. 
About 12 years ago, before she became a priest, Schneider was a member of the 
vestry at St. Augustine's. To the consternation of some parishioners, Boyd had 
just been called to serve as an associate rector and writer-in-residence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone said, 'How can we hire a professional homosexual?' I related that 
comment to Malcolm," Schneider recalled. "He was indignant! He said, 'I've 
never charged! Never!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, many in the church still see Boyd as a "gay priest" rather than a 
priest who happens to be gay.  
</P>
<P>
 "I live in different worlds and sometimes they don't meet except in me," Boyd 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He sees no contradiction between believing that all things will eventually 
work out in the long run and continuing to press in the here-and-now for gay 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's one thing that religion gives you, a sense of roots and a 
sense of timelessness. But with gay rights, I don't want to wait for eternity. 
I want them now. . . . I never want to lose the divine discontent, what 
Kierkegaard called the seeking and suffering, of being rent asunder in the 
peace of God. That's central to me. So peace of God isn't just Elysian Fields. 
I never want to lose that urgency and crisis. But I want to temper urgency and 
crisis with a certain sense of timelessness and very deep roots." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked what was the one irreducible thing he held onto, Boyd replied: "I 
don't think I've held onto it as much as it's held onto me. It's this terrible, 
strong love -- God's love and strength. It's just always been there."

SOCIALITE GIVES UP WEALTH, FAMILY TO BECOME A NUN; CONVENTS: ANN RUSSELL MILLER 
OF SAN FRANCISCO LEADS A CLOISTERED LIFE, AFTER 10 CHILDREN AND YEARS OF 
CELEBRITY AND PHILANTHROPY. BY ALL ACCOUNTS, SHE IS HAPPY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five years ago, she was Ann Russell Miller: a dynamic San Francisco socialite 
with season tickets to the opera, a propensity for silk parasols, and a knack 
for raising money for charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she is Sister Mary Joseph of the Trinity. She prays in silence behind a 
lattice of black iron bars that will keep her in seclusion and poverty for the 
rest of her life -- away from her 10 children, 19 grandchildren and an 
inherited fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 She sleeps on a wooden plank bed covered by a thin mattress in a small, barren 
cell. She is allowed to talk with her fellow nuns during two designated hours a 
day. She is permitted one visitor a month -- but even then, she must sit behind 
the double set of bars. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, she is happy. 
</P>
<P>
 How did this happen? Why did this vivacious woman turn her life upside down, 
giving away material riches for poverty? Her friends and family wonder, and 
wonder some more. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, it seems, is a mystery of faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller grew up in luxury and privilege as the only child of the former 
chairman of Southern Pacific Railroad, who was a devout Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
 She had dreams of being a nun since childhood, but fell in love instead. 
</P>
<P>
 At 19, she married Richard Miller, who became vice president of Pacific Gas & 
Electric, a utility company that once was a family business. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they made a vow: The person who survived the other would dedicate 
his or her life to God. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann and Richard had it all -- old money, celebrity friends and a nine-bedroom 
mansion overlooking the San Francisco Bay. He was chairman of the San Francisco 
Opera Assn.; she raised money for gifted college students, the homeless and the 
Roman Catholic Church. At one point, she was a member of 22 boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Petite and impeccably dressed, she had her hair done at Elizabeth Arden and 
bought her date books at Tiffany's. She called her friends "darling." 
</P>
<P>
 Full of warmth and energy, she attracted friends both rich and poor. She 
invited her pals on trips around the world, including cruises and archeological 
digs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever Ann called and said, 'Guess what we're doing this weekend?' we said, 
'Fine, count us in,' and it was always a gas," said one friend, Jean McClatchy 
Bricker. "That's why the thought of seclusion was so amazing to her friends, 
because it was such a contrast." 
</P>
<P>
 When her husband died of cancer in 1984, Ann began making plans to fulfill her 
pledge to her husband and to God. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, she announced she would join the Carmelite Monastery here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've stopped trying to figure it out," Bricker said. "She just enjoyed 
worldly things so much that I wouldn't have thought of it, except I knew the 
other side of Ann." 
</P>
<P>
 The other side was the deeply religious side. The side that drew her to Mass 
every morning and to Lourdes with her husband who used a wheelchair, praying 
for a cancer cure. 
</P>
<P>
 She attended annual religious retreats. She nailed Stations of the Cross, a 
series of 14 crosses representing the stages of Jesus' final suffering and his 
death and burial, in the redwood grove at the family's weekend compound in the 
coastal hills near San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she had a call to the contemplative life, as hard as that is to 
understand," said Father Val McInnes, a Dominican priest who visited her 
recently. "She was almost like a whirling dervish in many ways, but always part 
of her life was a contemplative element." 
</P>
<P>
 In the two years before she entered the monastery in 1989, Ann began putting 
her affairs in order to become a bride of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 With the zeal and enthusiasm of planning a wedding, she divvied up her 
fortune. Her children picked through the Pacific Heights mansion choosing 
candlesticks, photo albums and furniture. She arranged a giant garage sale for 
the leftovers and donated the proceeds to charity. 
</P>
<P>
 She revved up her jet-set lifestyle and visited friends in Europe, the Orient 
and South America. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, 1989, on the eve of her induction into the monastery, she invited 
hundreds of friends to a Mass at St. Mary's Cathedral, where the archbishop of 
San Francisco officiated. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, she threw a black tie gala in the grand ballroom of the Hilton 
Hotel, inviting 800 guests. It was her 61st birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first two-thirds of my life were devoted to the world. The last third 
will be devoted to my soul," she told her teary-eyed friends that night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can do more for you by praying than any other way," she told one friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller underwent a five-year trial with her fellow nuns before being allowed 
to take her final vows in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, the Carmelites do not accept widows because of the complications and 
distractions of children and their past lives, said Mother Catherine, who heads 
the monastery. But they made an exception for Ann because they knew she was 
sincere, emotionally stable and devoted to God and a life of prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of her friends thought she would not survive the silence and solitude and 
would "flunk out of nun school," as one friend put it. 
</P>
<P>
 But she hasn't. Despite missing the weddings of two daughters and the births 
of five grandchildren over the past five years, she has remained resolute. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the other 17 nuns in the monastery, Sister Mary Joseph wears a long brown 
habit, black veil and sandals. She spends her days making rosary beads out of 
crushed rose petals, weeding the vegetable garden, scrubbing the refectory 
floor and pushing the gas-fired lawn mower across the convent's spacious 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Her friends write to her often, and visit occasionally. She is allowed a 
limited number of responses -- many of them screened by Mother Catherine. 
</P>
<P>
 She was not allowed to meet with a reporter, however. Mother Catherine said it 
would be a distraction to her life of meditation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Mary Joseph's children are as silent as she is, refusing to talk about 
the events that created a rift in the family. Three sons did not attend her 
final vows. 
</P>
<P>
 But through the years, most of her children have come to understand that this 
is where she is happiest, McInnes said. And, he said, they should find solace 
in the fact that the monastery walls have not dampened her energy and humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they opened the window to Ann, they not only got a breath of fresh air," 
he said, "but part of a hurricane as well."

ELECTIONS / THOUSAND OAKS SCHOOL BOARD; 10 CANDIDATES SEE SAFETY, TECHNOLOGY 
AND MONEY AS KEY ISSUES IN RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Improved school safety, increased technology and money are the key issues for 
all 10 candidates seeking three open seats on the Thousand Oaks school board 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Two incumbents and eight challengers agree that safety should be improved at 
the Conejo Valley Unified School District's 27 campuses, and they say the use 
of technology should be expanded in classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the district's $72-million budget is balanced, candidates also agree 
that board members must keep a watchful eye on the budget to avoid future 
salary reductions or layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the biggest problem in this election is that we agree on everything," 
said candidate Robin Cohen Westmiller, one of the eight challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Heitmann, Elaine McKearn, Elroi Reimnitz, Charles Rittenburg, Barbara 
Sponsler, Ellyn Wilkins and Susan Witting are also challengers in the largest 
school board race in Ventura County this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the current five-member board as weak and closed to parent 
feedback, some challengers say their main goal is to oust the two incumbents -- 
Mildred Lynch and Richard Newman. The third available seat belonged to William 
Henry, Jr., who resigned in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think with every public body, new people bring new ideas and generate 
enthusiasm," said Heitmann, 49, a family counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the ideas suggested by candidates include seeking government grants to 
fund school programs and televising board meetings to reach more families. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitmann said she wants to develop a comprehensive plan on how to expand the 
use of technology in Conejo Valley schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Westmiller, 40, owner of a paper supply store, suggests teaching children 
self-defense techniques in their physical education classes to protect 
youngsters from violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McKearn, a 51-year-old homemaker, wants to increase parent involvement and 
make schools more "family friendly" by adding parent aides in classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 But some candidates say the district simply needs strong leadership -- not new 
programs -- to maintain the high quality of education in Thousand Oaks' 
schools. About 80% of the district's graduates go to college, and students have 
consistently outscored their peers in other districts on standardized tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any real leadership from the superintendent or the board," said 
Wilkins, 47, an insurance saleswoman and former Thousand Oaks school board 
member for six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates also say school leaders must find new and creative ways to confront 
issues like budget cuts by seeking funds from businesses and lobbying 
Sacramento for more money. 
</P>
<P>
 Witting, a 36-year-old attorney, said trustees must reach out to the community 
and consistently seek change for the better. "You can't just sit on your 
laurels," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One area where challengers and incumbents disagree is on the issue of parent 
involvement. The eight contenders have criticized the board for not listening 
to parent concerns, but Lynch and Newman say that claim is unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like people are having to fight for what is their right," said 
Sponsler, 49, a bank customer service representative. "There needs to be some 
interaction with the parents and the board." 
</P>
<P>
 Reimnitz, 46, pastor of Redeemer Lutheran Church in Thousand Oaks, decided to 
run for the school board after watching the trustees ignore parents' concerns 
over the California Learning Assessment System test, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you represent the parents, you have to listen to their concerns," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 43-year-old engineer for Northrup Grumman, Rittenburg said he decided to run 
for the school board out of frustration with current trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our board and our district have a terrible reputation for not listening to 
the public," Rittenburg said. "I think all the candidates recognize the need to 
re-establish community trust." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But incumbents Lynch and Newman said the current board has listened to parents 
and shown strong leadership skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this district has been cited for its response to parent direction," 
said Newman, 66, a retired Simi Valley Police lieutenant who has served on the 
board since 1989. "I am very satisfied that the district is a great district." 
</P>
<P>
 A trustee for nine years and a teacher for 35 years, Lynch, 77, testified 
before state legislators about the CLAS test -- an act she said shows she has 
not neglected parents' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not say the board has been indifferent," she said. "I think it has 
been effective. We pushed hard on curriculum and new buildings and repairs." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch said parents should be involved in education by knowing what their 
children are learning: "I want them to see what they are doing -- what their 
kids are reading and what they are writing." 
</P>
<P>
 One aspect of the campaign challengers and incumbents agree on is the 
difficulty they are all having in getting noticed by east county voters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With 10 people running for the school board and 16 candidates running for the 
City Council, candidates say they are struggling for name recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many candidates it makes it difficult for people to distinguish 
from them all," Witting said. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, this is the first year the Thousand Oaks' school board election 
has coincided with the general election, a change that candidates say has 
resulted in their names getting lost amid the more high-profile county and 
congressional races. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted a few years ago to move the election to cut costs and tap into 
a larger voter pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school board race is lost in the shuffle," Wilkins said. "We are doing 
everything we can to let people know we are out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Some candidates are spending thousands of dollars to stand out among the 
throng of candidates. Heitmann, for example, said she expects to spend close to 
$9,000 on her campaign. "We are low ballot here," she said. "You have to be out 
there in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But other candidates say they refuse to take campaign contributions, and are 
unwilling to spend vast amounts of money on signs, flyers, buttons and other 
election paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Westmiller said she has spent less than $50 on her campaign, and McKearn made 
her election signs out of damaged boards from a local hardware store. 
</P>
<P>
 Some candidates say their signs have been stolen, and Witting had about 15 of 
her signs vandalized recently when somebody scrawled satanic symbols on them in 
red paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Rittenburg, who ran for the board in 1989, said he has noticed a tremendous 
difference between this election and the one five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1989, we had quiet forums, it was very small town," he said. But this 
year: "You get a sense of a big city election."

ELECTIONS / SIMI VALLEY COUNCIL; PASTORS PROBE VALUES OF CANDIDATES DURING HIGH 
ADVENTURE FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a pre-election forum that at times resembled a religious revival, a dozen 
Simi Valley pastors confronted City Council candidates about what they called 
an apparent lack of concern for the Christian community. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosted by High Adventure Ministries, a worldwide Christian radio network based 
in Simi Valley, the hourlong forum at the Clarion Hotel on Friday opened with a 
prayer from High Adventure founder George Otis. 
</P>
<P>
 To murmurs of "Amen" and "Yes" and "Right on" from the crowd of about 25, Otis 
asked for God's guidance in "getting us out of this excessive syndrome of 
separation of church and state." 
</P>
<P>
 Comment and applause punctuated opening statements by the three candidates who 
attended -- incumbent Councilwoman Sandi Webb, former police chief Lindsey Paul 
Miller and former Chamber of Commerce president Michael S. McCaffrey. In all, 
seven candidates are vying for two seats on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But during the question period that followed, the response from the crowd grew 
less enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Clutching a voter guide for the Pro-Family Caucus of Ventura County and the 
Christian Coalition of Eastern Ventura County, the Rev. Ken Craft of Sonrise 
Fellowship Church asked the first question. 
</P>
<P>
 Craft demanded to know why the three candidates did not participate in the 
guide, which lists council candidate positions on laws to restrict adult 
entertainment, outlaw discrimination based on sexual preference and give 
special protection for abortion clinics.  
</P>
<P>
 "Doesn't the Christian community deserve to be informed?" Craft asked. 
"There's this mentality of 'Who gives a rip about the Christian community?' Is 
it a prejudice thing?" 
</P>
<P>
 McCaffrey said he chose not to participate in the guide because he felt the 
questions were not directly relevant to the job of running a city. Webb said 
she had returned her response. "It must have been lost in the mail," she said. 
Miller said he hadn't received the questionnaire. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All three candidates said they are concerned about Simi Valley's Christian 
community and welcomed the chance to participate in the forum. They all said 
they would be happy to meet with the pastors after the forum to discuss the 
topics covered in the voter guide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am delighted to be here," Miller said. "I'm happy to see the religious 
community is taking a more active role in the city." 
</P>
<P>
 The guide also includes candidate positions on increasing fees or cutting 
services to balance city budgets, selling bonds to raise revenue for local 
projects, limiting development and imposing term limits on city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 McCaffrey objected to the questions that were not related to city government. 
</P>
<P>
 "The questions in my opinion do not reflect what a city councilman or woman 
has responsibility for," McCaffrey said. "If you are asking my response on 
anything that has to do with the council, I am there to respond." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McCaffrey's remarks prompted a terse exchange between the candidate and his 
host. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to be elected, this is a good voting bloc," Otis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you saying a candidate must reply" to the questionnaire? McCaffrey asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "A smart candidate would," Otis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Kurt Fredrickson of Simi Covenant Church came to the defense of the 
candidates, saying it is right to be cautious in participating in the guides, 
some of which may be put out by groups with political agendas. 
</P>
<P>
 "You guys have a tough job," Fredrickson said. "There are political slants to 
all of these things that come out." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rev. John McKendricks of the Church of the Living Christ said the 
voter guides play a critical role in helping his congregation decide whom to 
vote for. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for a church to get a sense of the candidates' real values from the 
newspaper," McKendricks said. "We have no way of knowing what you believe in. 
These questions reflect your values." 
</P>
<P>
 The forum is the first of many that High Adventure hopes to sponsor in Simi 
Valley, Otis said. While he has no plans to broadcast the meeting on his 
religious radio network, he said he hopes the pastors will relay highlights of 
the event to their congregations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten some illumination," Otis said. "Some of it we like, and some of 
it we're going to pray about."

CHIEF'S MEMO ON DRUG SALES CHALLENGED; CRIME: LEGAL EXPERTS CONTRADICT CLAIMS 
THAT SELLING OF ROCK COCAINE TO SUSPECTS BY SANTA ANA POLICE RESULTS IN 
STRONGER CASES AGAINST OFFENDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police Chief Paul M. Walters misinformed the City Council when he explained 
his secret operation to send undercover officers onto the streets to sell 
county-made crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo sent to the mayor and council after the operation came to light last 
week, Walters said the department needed to use real cocaine in order to make 
felony cases against drug users and send them to prison.  
</P>
<P>
 The chief also told the council that even those drug suspects who ended up in 
drug diversion programs -- instead of custody -- still would remain under legal 
scrutiny on probation.  
</P>
<P>
 But police and legal experts say both statements are incorrect: The police 
still could file felonies using cocaine substitutes. And people who complete 
diversion programs end up with their cases dismissed -- and are not on 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no probation, there's no anything. Your case is over with," Deputy 
Public Defender Brian Ducker said. "You've been diverted out of the criminal 
justice system. That's the purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in behalf of the chief, Capt. Bruce R. Carlson said the letter was 
intended to provide council members with facts about the program so they could 
answer questions in the community. He said there was no intention to mislead 
the council members. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not a sales pitch for what we're doing. This was to try to relate 
the facts as clearly as we could so (council members) could answer questions," 
he said. "This is a program we want to continue using because there's no other 
way. We're not necessarily married to anything, but if it works we feel we 
should continue on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson also said that the best way to ensure strong felony cases is to use 
real drugs, and said he needed additional information before commenting on the 
diversion issue. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to say who drafted the memo, which bears the chief's signature, 
but said the information came out of discussions with the district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 18 months, Santa Ana police officers have obtained court orders 
to sell rock cocaine on the streets in an effort to bust small-time buyers. 
More than 350 people have been arrested for buying the rocks, which are 
processed in the Orange County Sheriff's Department's crime lab from powdered 
cocaine confiscated in other Santa Ana drug raids. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and prosecutors say most of the 350 people arrested in Santa Ana were 
first-time buyers who were allowed to enter diversion programs rather than face 
jail time. The chief's memo states that those first-time offenders "are subject 
to search and seizure and they are on felony probation at the completion of 
their diversion program." 
</P>
<P>
 But Carl Armbrust, who heads the district attorney's Narcotics Enforcement 
Team and helped craft the Santa Ana operation, said that anyone who completes 
diversion has his case dismissed and is not on probation. 
</P>
<P>
 The memo also says that it is essential to use real cocaine to file felony 
charges. "Using any other substance would result in only a misdemeanor charge 
of soliciting for a drug purchase," the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, however, has made 392 felony 
arrests using fake cocaine in reverse stings since February and 99% have been 
"successfully prosecuted," said Capt. Dennis Dahlman, commander of the 
Sheriff's Department's Narcotics Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "Attempted possession is a felony. We've prosecuted a few people under the 
three strikes law," said Dahlman, referring to the new state law that calls for 
25 years to life in prison for third-time felons. 
</P>
<P>
 Armbrust said his office used to charge suspects with felony attempted 
possession when they purchased fake narcotics in reverse-sting operations, but 
decided the Santa Ana cases would be stronger if officers sold the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided that that would be kind of a Mickey Mouse charge," Armbrust said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Florida, hundreds of convictions were overturned after a state court ruled 
that the Broward County's manufacture of rock cocaine in a similar operation 
was illegal and "shocked the conscience." The technique of using real drugs is 
controversial because suspects sometimes swallow the rock or throw it away 
before an officer can recover it.  
</P>
<P>
 Several Santa Ana council members said Friday that they were confident the 
chief's memo contained accurate information. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the information was correct and I don't have any reason not to 
believe it. I'm comfortable with what was presented to us," Councilman Thomas 
E. Lutz said. "If the chief tells me that it's not correct, then I'll worry 
about it then." 
</P>
<P>
 Several said they have heard only positive comments from residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're glad that something is being done in an aggressive manner to be able 
to remove people from the streets, and within the law," Councilwoman Patricia 
A. McGuigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Lisa Mills said she was told that the information in the memo 
came directly from the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to have a follow-up from the chief," she said. "If it turns out that 
any of the information is incorrect, I'm sure he'll follow up with new 
information. He's very good at that."

PROPOSAL FOR OLD CITY HALL LEAVES COUNCIL WITH A TOUGH CHOICE; THOUSAND OAKS: 
GROUP HOPES TO USE FACILITY RENT-FREE AS A CHILDREN'S SCIENCE MUSEUM. BUT 
OFFICIALS HAD COUNTED ON SELLING THE SITE TO RAISE MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 What will it be: cash or children? 
</P>
<P>
 That's the stark choice facing Thousand Oaks council members Tuesday as they 
consider a proposal to give their old City Hall rent-free to a nonprofit group 
intent on developing a science museum for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum backers have promised to renovate the run-down, neglected building at 
401 W. Hillcrest Drive at a cost of up to $600,000. In return, they will ask 
the council to grant them rent-free use of the space for five years. If the 
museum proves successful, the backers will negotiate with the city to buy the 
property outright. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal forces council members to make a tough decision. 
</P>
<P>
 All five have backed the concept of a Discovery Center -- a fun-for-all-ages 
museum where students could explore scientific principles through hands-on 
exhibits, nature walks, even overnight camp-outs. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members have also counted on raising $13 million from the sale or 
lease of the Hillcrest Drive property to pay off debts from the Civic Arts 
Plaza project. Giving the old City Hall away -- even for just five years -- 
would leave a huge gap in their funding plan for the $86-million arts plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Without revenue from the property, city officials would be hard-pressed to 
replenish accounts they tapped in the scramble to pay arts plaza bills. They 
borrowed more than $20.5 million from various city funds, including accounts 
set aside for affordable housing, construction projects, golf course repairs 
and other needs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And they have pledged to repay the internal loans, with interest, as soon as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic concept was always to sell (401 W. Hillcrest Drive) to raise cash 
to pay for the new City Hall, or to lease the building on an interim basis" 
until real estate prices rebound, Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. "If we're going 
to change the concept, the council has to buy into it, and it better be the 
whole council." 
</P>
<P>
 While emphasizing that she has not made up her mind on the Discovery Center 
proposal, Lazar added, "It's not necessarily the city's responsibility to 
provide space to every nonprofit in town. I know their intentions are good, and 
the idea is wonderful . . . but good intentions alone don't hack it. There are 
a lot of questions to be asked." 
</P>
<P>
 The two council members most concerned about the city's massive arts plaza 
debt -- Elois Zeanah and Jaime Zukowski -- have already signaled strong support 
for converting the old City Hall into a Discovery Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Zeanah and Zukowski fear that a future council may rezone the Hillcrest 
Drive site to allow for intense development in order to inflate the parcel's 
price and fill city coffers.  
</P>
<P>
 The most recent appraisal listed a site value of up to $14 million -- but only 
if the city would permit condominiums, a restaurant and office space there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By allowing the Discovery Center group to fix up the gutted building, Zukowski 
hopes to ease the pressure for more intense development on the dramatic, grassy 
hillside. 
</P>
<P>
 "To continue to neglect the building like (we have been) will lead to only one 
result: razing the building and maximizing the land use," Zukowski said. 
"People will make the rationalization that we should just start from scratch. 
But that building was created for public use." 
</P>
<P>
 Discovery Center backers say they believe their exploratorium would attract at 
least 50,000 visitors a year. With ticket sales, gift-shop revenue, grants and 
donations, they hope to raise enough money to buy the Hillcrest Drive building 
within five years of the museum's opening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the money now," organizer Carrie Glicksteen said. "But we're 
sure we can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 If her group does not amass the resources to buy or lease the building at 
market rates, Glicksteen said, the city can always evict the Discovery Center 
and look for a more profitable tenant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That option, however, does not appeal to Lazar. The community has expressed 
enthusiasm about a children's museum, and would very likely clamor to keep any 
center that was established in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be difficult to kick them out -- it always is," Lazar said. "They 
can rally a great deal of support." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to capitalize on that support, Discovery Center backers have laid out 
lavish plans for their museum: a technology lab where students could conduct 
research, a virtual reality center with state-of-the-art equipment, a lending 
library and countless science exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 They will take their dreams to the council at Tuesday's meeting with one 
simple pitch: "This community," Glicksteen said, "is built on families. It's 
built on good things for families to do."

ISSUES ARE PERSONAL IN DORNAN-FARBER DEBATE; ELECTIONS: CHARACTER -- OR LACK OF 
IT -- IS FOCUS OF ALLEGATIONS. LIBERTARIAN CANDIDATE NEWHOUSE CALLS FOR TERM 
LIMITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Republican Rep. Robert K. Dornan and his Democratic opponent, Mike Farber, 
took some wild verbal swings at each other during and after a television debate 
taping Friday, with Dornan angrily calling his challenger "a twit" and Farber 
alleging that the incumbent lacks moral character. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues varying from Proposition 187, the immigration measure on the Nov. 8 
ballot, to term limits for Congress, were overshadowed by the caustic exchanges 
between the Garden Grove congressman and his Democratic challenger regarding 
decades-old allegations that Dornan abused his wife, Sallie. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan and Farber, who are competing for the 46th Congressional District seat, 
stole the spotlight from other candidates who participated in the KOCE-TV 
debate: Libertarian Richard G.Newhouse, the third candidate in the 46th 
District race; and Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) and his 
Democratic challenger, Brett Williamson, in the 45th Congressional District 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Farber, looking uneasy at first, took the first shot at Dornan when he held up 
two blank sheets of paper -- the first depicting what Farber said was Dornan's 
lack of accomplishments during his 16 years in Congress, and the second which 
Farber claimed was Dornan's "record of character, a character that he has tried 
to hide from the public for the last 16 years. It's blank also." 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrat was referring to court records dated between 1960 and 1976, in 
which Dornan's wife, Sallie, accused her husband of spousal abuse. Sallie 
Dornan has since recanted those charges, claiming they were made while she was 
addicted to prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Farber has used the court records in his campaign mailers. The Dornans 
have filed a libel suit against Farber. 
</P>
<P>
 The cross-fire between the two candidates intensified. Dornan, who listed 
redevelopment and crime programs he has supported for his district, quickly 
changed the topic to defend himself against the spousal abuse charges. He said 
Farber was the first opponent he has had in nine elections whose hand he 
refused to shake. 
</P>
<P>
 "To attack my wife the way he has, to get into the gutter . . . it's a 
disgrace," Dornan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never attacked Sallie Dornan. I have attacked Bob Dornan's character 
and that is it," Farber replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "She thinks all these attacks are against her," Dornan argued. 
</P>
<P>
 Farber challenged Dornan to "step forward and take responsibility" for his 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan coolly responded: "Mike, I thought you were about 6-foot-2 the way 
you're coming on. I didn't realize that you're a twit. . . . It's amazing that 
you would attack a woman that's taller than you are." (Farber's spokesman said 
the candidate is 5-foot-9 and Sallie Dornan is 5-foot-6.) 
</P>
<P>
 The quarreling continued after the 30-minute debate ended, with Dornan 
taunting Farber and his aides, accusing them of having gay rights activists and 
a "pornographer" on their staff. The Farber campaign denied it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go get elected to the state Senate or the state Assembly and I won't get in 
your face again," Dornan told Farber. The candidate walked away without 
responding, but one of his aides shouted back to Dornan at one point, "That's a 
man; that's a real man." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher, who was standing nearby, twice tugged at Dornan to pull him away 
from the verbal jousting. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhouse, a professor at Rancho Santiago College, stayed out of the fray 
during the television taping but directed most of his comments to Dornan. "The 
best term limits possible is to terminate Bob Dornan this time. He's been in 
there 16 years," Newhouse said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other contest featured in the debate, Rohrabacher touted himself as an 
anti-spending congressman who has fought to remove government benefits from 
illegal immigrants. He also said he favors a constitutional amendment limiting 
congressional terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike the Democrats, we are going to bring this to the (House) floor for a 
vote," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson said he favors three two-year terms for members of the House, but 
noted that Rohrabacher supports twice as many terms. "That's not the term 
limits Californians voted for in 1992," Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate will air on Thursday.

SCHOOL DISTRICT REJECTS HOMEWORK BAN; EDUCATION: NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BOARD WILL 
REVIEW THE WAY ASSIGNMENTS ARE GIVEN AND PROPOSE CHANGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Trustees of the Cabrillo Unified School District in the tiny coastal town of 
Half Moon Bay voted late Thursday before an audience of nearly 200 people to 
review their homework policies rather than abolish homework.  
</P>
<P>
 With television cameras from around the country present, the board voted 3 to 
1, with one abstention, to create a task force to review the district's 
homework policies, investigate how assignments are given and come back in 
January with preliminary proposals for change. 
</P>
<P>
 The one abstainer was trustee Garrett Redmond, the flamboyant farmer who 
forced this Northern California town into the international spotlight two weeks 
ago when he asked his school district to eliminate homework because, he said, 
it is inequitable and cuts into family time. 
</P>
<P>
 Redmond left the meeting early because it had turned into a circus, he said. 
"I got tired of hearing that (the suggestion) was an embarrassment," he said. 
Of the vote, he remarked: "That's what I call government psychobabble for 'they 
killed it.' Whenever any government body sets something for study, it's headed 
for the round file." 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Jane Martin opposed banning homework but said district policies setting 
minimum homework times for students at all grade levels could stand some 
change. To her, the outcome of Half Moon Bay's two weeks in the limelight was 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she was particularly impressed by the students who spoke at the 
meeting. "They all felt that there should be some homework," Martin said. "But 
they thought it would be appropriate to look at the amount, expectations and 
coordination." 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that it can count for as much as 50% of a grade, Redmond called 
homework inequitable because he said it favors computer-savvy, upper-income 
children at the expense of the poor. Homework also clashes with family time, 
Redmond said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some speakers at the meeting called his proposal a "goofy idea" that would 
sabotage the district's children in college and said it had made Half Moon Bay 
into a laughingstock. But most who rose from the crowd packed into an 
elementary school auditorium agreed that something should be changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Dahlen, 11, said her sixth-grade homework was oppressive, often taking 
her until 8 or 10 p.m. to finish. "I feel overloaded," she said. "I have not 
had time to do my chores, to feed my dog, to sometimes help make dinner for the 
family."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / ATTORNEY GENERAL; LUNGREN, UMBERG CONTINUE BRAWL OVER TV 
AD; IN THE FINAL DEBATE OF THE CAMPAIGN, INCUMBENT ATTACKS AS 'DESPICABLE' 
SUGGESTIONS THAT HE IS TO BLAME FOR THE POLLY KLAAS SLAYING. 
</P>

<P>
 Squaring off just miles from where Polly Klaas lived and died, Republican 
Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren and Democrat Tom Umberg continued their brawl Friday 
over the challenger's TV commercial suggesting that Lungren shares the blame 
for the notorious Northern California murder. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last of their 11 bruising debates, Umberg defended the 30-second 
commercial featuring the girl's grandfather, while Lungren blasted it as "the 
most disgusting, despicable ad in the history of California politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren also attacked Umberg for receiving more than $300,000 in campaign 
contributions -- and getting a promise of $250,000 more -- from Native American 
tribes operating casinos in the state. Umberg countered that Lungren has taken 
more than $40,000 from racetracks, card clubs and a Nevada casino. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates, who debated for 90 minutes on a Santa Rosa radio talk show, 
also jousted over Proposition 187, the immigration reform measure on the Nov. 8 
ballot. Umberg is staunchly opposed while Lungren has yet to take a position. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bulk of the dust-up was spent fighting over Umberg's TV ad. Although 
the challenger was 23 points down in a Times poll conducted before the 
commercial began airing earlier this week, Umberg has seized the offensive, 
framing the debate around the attorney general's role in the Klaas case. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the debate, Umberg repeated elements of his TV commercial -- that 
Lungren had raised his public relations budget at the same time he was failing 
to properly fund a computer database that might have helped crack the case 
before Polly Klaas was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 About 90 minutes after the girl was kidnaped last year, two sheriff's deputies 
questioned Richard Allen Davis, who was later charged with the murder. After a 
call to their dispatcher failed to turn up warrants or traffic violations, the 
deputies let Davis go. But when he was apprehended two months later, Davis said 
the 12-year-old girl had been hidden nearby and was alive when he talked to the 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg contends that the computer database would have alerted the deputies to 
the fact that Davis was a parolee, increasing the chances he would have been 
brought in for further questioning. He cited a December, 1993, newspaper story 
quoting Lungren as saying that the system "would have helped our officers that 
night." 
</P>
<P>
 "The ad does not accuse the attorney general of murder," Umberg said, but 
rather of "misplaced priorities." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren countered with his most detailed defense to date, arguing that it was 
pure supposition to suggest that the database could have helped. 
</P>
<P>
 At one juncture, he engaged in a sharp exchange with Joe Klaas, the 
grandfather of the slain girl. Klaas, speaking by phone from his home in 
Carmel, was drowned out by Lungren during the broadcast. "I understand the pain 
of someone who has lost a child, but that doesn't give someone the right to 
mislead the people," Lungren said, arguing that the commercial threatened to 
undermine the case against Davis before it reaches trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The talk show host also called the Umberg commercial "absolutely the sleaziest 
ad" most people have ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are they more concerned about that than the fact that Polly's life could 
have been saved if the attorney general had not gutted that program?" Klaas 
countered. "We didn't make this up." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren later responded: "I'm not running against Joe Klaas." 
</P>
<P>
 "You're running against Joe Klaas, you just don't know it yet," Klaas 
retorted. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the vitriol, Lungren got a boost from Sonoma County Sheriff Mark Ihde, 
who showed up at the radio station during the morning confrontation and 
declared to reporters that the Umberg commercial was "outrageous" and the "act 
of a desperate politician." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In his reply to the Umberg charge, Lungren said that while he was not blaming 
the deputies, there were other indications to arouse their suspicions.  
</P>
<P>
 "The officers indicated that when they saw (Davis), he had convict tattoos up 
and down his arm," Lungren said. "They spotted him immediately as a parolee. He 
told them he was out of the joint and currently on parole. . . . To suggest 
they needed another (computer) program to tell them that is an absolute 
distortion of facts." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Lungren maintained that Davis actually revealed to the officers that he 
had recently been paroled from prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an interview later, Sheriff Ihde said he did not recall that Davis had 
made such a revelation to the deputies. Told of Ihde's comments, Lungren said 
he had learned about Davis' statement from FBI officials who investigated the 
case. An FBI spokesman in San Francisco said the agency would not comment on 
the matter.

TRUSTEE WITH HOME SCHOOL IS URGED TO RESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The president of the Orange Unified School District's teachers union called on 
Trustee Max Reissmueller to "do the honorable thing" and resign after he pulled 
his daughter out of public school and began a home-schooling program. 
</P>
<P>
 "School boards should be made up of persons who have a strong commitment to 
public schools and are good role models for the employees of the district," 
said union President David Reger at Thursday night's school board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Max Reissmueller, through his lack of attendance in a public school, his 
current action to privatize our district and in removing his daughter from the 
public schools and starting a private school, has shown he does not believe in 
public schools," Reger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reissmueller, 26, defended his decision to pull his 6-year-old daughter out of 
the district and teach her at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take a lot of criticism for standing up for what I believe in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Home-schooling was a concept he had long considered, and the emphasis his 
daughter's school placed on Halloween helped him make the decision, he said. 
Reissmueller objected to the school's observation of the holiday for religious 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that his actions should not reflect on his daughter's former school. 
"I think Chapman Hills (Elementary School) is a wonderful school and Kathy 
Kessler is an excellent principal," he said. "I really do see the whole thing 
as a personal matter."

O.C. RELIGION NOTES / DAYE CLARK: CHURCH SANCTUARY TO BE CONSECRATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAYE CLARK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new sanctuary at St. Paul's Greek Orthodox Church in Irvine will be 
consecrated, beginning with a consecration vespers service tonight and 
continuing Sunday with the consecration service. In the Orthodox Christian 
setting, consecration means to set aside a new sanctuary to the Glory of God. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7 tonight will be great vespers, which includes bringing the relics or 
remains of saints into the sanctuary and placing them on the new altar table 
with a vigil lamp. During the consecration service, holy relics are sealed into 
the altar table where they will remain. On Sunday the Matins and consecration 
service will take place. There will be a procession three times around the 
church to set boundaries that will be consecrated as part of the sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 Psalm 24 will be sung, which allows the clergy and congregation to enter the 
church. The archbishop places the relics into the altar table, which is then 
washed and anointed with the holy oil of Chrismation. After this baptism of the 
new altar, other altar appointments will be blessed and placed on the altar 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 The archbishop and bishop will bless all areas of the church building by 
anointing them with the holy oil of Chrismation, then the oil vigil lamp will 
be placed on the altar table. 
</P>
<P>
 Archbishop Iakovos, Bishop Anthony and other bishops and priests from Southern 
California will participate in the services. Archbishop Iakovos, who is 
spiritual leader of Orthodox Christians in North and South America, became the 
archbishop in 1959. He presides over the Standing Conference of Orthodox 
Bishops in the United States. Bishop Anthony of San Francisco is bishop of the 
western states. Father George S. Stephanides is pastor of St. Paul's Greek 
Orthodox Church. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Matins is at 8:30 a.m., followed by the consecration service at 
9:30. The first Divine Liturgy in the consecrated church is at 11:30 a.m. The 
church is at 4949 Alton Parkway. Information: (714) 733-2366.

CHALLENGING BIBLICAL ASSUMPTIONS; BOOK: GOSPEL RESEARCHER OFFERS SOME RADICAL 
NOTIONS IN SELF-PUBLISHED WORK. DESPITE HIS AMATEUR STATUS, IT HAS DRAWN PRAISE 
FROM MANY SCHOLARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After spending years selling sophisticated computer systems, Evan Powell is 
marketing something he believes is every bit as revolutionary: His own findings 
in Gospel research. 
</P>
<P>
 His conclusions challenge long-held assumptions about which gospel was written 
first, and even the authorship of portions of the Gospels, with consequences 
for understanding early Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, 41, self-published his first book, "The Unfinished Gospel: Notes on 
the Quest for the Historical Jesus" in May, and it has been in bookstores since 
Oct 1. Praised by some biblical scholars despite Powell's amateur status, the 
first printing of 3,000 has sold out and a second printing of 10,000 is in 
bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 The book is one of a recent spate of works that attempt to dig behind the 
Gospels to establish a historical Jesus, including a book by a coalition of 
American Bible scholars which concluded that Jesus said only 18% of what has 
been attributed to him in the Gospels. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike those books, many of which were published by major houses, Powell's 
is the fruit of his own determination. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lake Sherwood resident is a salesman through and through, and that 
expertise enabled him to do something almost unheard of for a novice author 
with a self-published hardback book: He cut a deal with a major distributor. 
National bookstore chains are carrying the book, and it will be distributed in 
four English-speaking foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The selling point? His conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 Many biblical scholars have long thought that the gospel of Mark lacks a 
coherent ending, and that there may have been a final chapter, lost centuries 
ago. Powell contends it wasn't lost at all, but was taken off the Gospel of 
Mark and moved to the Gospel of John, where it is known today as John 21, a 
curious last chapter that has long been considered awkward and redundant where 
it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime during the First Century, the ending of Mark's gospel was appended to 
John's for political reasons within the church, Powell believes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gospel of John was written to demonstrate that Peter was not to be 
trusted as a leader of the church," Powell said. "I believe Mark was written as 
a rebuttal to John. In their original form, these gospels are quite at odds." 
</P>
<P>
 John 21 describes an encounter between Jesus and Peter, one of the original 
apostles, after the Resurrection. Jesus forgives Peter and tells him to take an 
active role -- in the leadership of the church, an admonition that Catholics 
believe made Peter the first pope. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Powell believes the chapter was shifted from one author to the other to weaken 
John's criticism of Peter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adding the last chapter to John has the effect of neutralizing the attack on 
Peter," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Powell offers a second radical notion: That John wrote the first 
gospel. Most scholars believe it was the last of the four, written near the end 
of the First Century. 
</P>
<P>
 If John were written closer to Jesus' life than were the other gospels, "then 
the attacks on Peter take on more authenticity," Powell said. "There is greater 
potential that John was written by eyewitnesses to events." 
</P>
<P>
 Leading biblical scholars might be slow to warm up to Powell's conclusions. 
The author, after all, has no formal religious training, despite a lifelong 
interest in the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 "His ideas are very attractive at first glance; they make you stop and think," 
said Ronald F. Hock, a professor of religion at USC who has read "The 
Unfinished Gospel." 
</P>
<P>
 "What is needed now is a very careful analysis of what he has proposed, 
especially the lost ending to Mark." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell also offers a radical notion in explaining the Resurrection. He 
believes that Jesus did not die during the crucifixion, but went through a 
"near death experience" and lived several days until he died of the wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggesting that Jesus experienced the same near-death or NDE feelings 
described by many modern survivors -- who frequently say they returned from a 
spiritual realm of incredible tranquillity -- helped Powell resolve a 
contradiction that had troubled him since his early 20s when he contemplated 
entering the Presbyterian ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jesus spent his life trying to re-establish the tradition of Judaism in a way 
that was less institutional and political," Powell said. "How does the movement 
of a religious reformer suddenly transform itself into a movement expounding 
salvation and eternal life? Those two things just do not connect. 
</P>
<P>
 "NDE provides the spiritual element that changed Jesus' reformist movement 
into a spiritual movement." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell's marketing instincts told him to avoid mention of his theory of Jesus' 
survival on the book jacket and in advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "When it is separated from the context of the book, saying that Jesus survived 
the crucifixion comes across as sensationalistic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Unfinished Gospel," despite its radical offerings, is anything but 
shrill. Powell wrote it with the lay reader in mind, but his arguments are 
consistent with historical-literary critical methods, knowledgeable readers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell established an 800 number to his home in Westlake Village for book 
sales and has bought print advertisements. And rather than holding his breath 
worrying how the book will be received by biblical scholars, he actively 
solicited reviews, mailing more than 200 copies to religion writers and book 
reviewers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Early reviews are in, and they are encouraging. Samples: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Powell is an original thinker. There is something here to challenge or 
offend virtually every reader. Not a book for the fainthearted, "The Unfinished 
Gospel" is an open invitation to debate over vital issues in the life of 
Jesus." -- R. Alan Culpepper, Baylor University. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Powell's thesis is clear, complete and convincing. His argument is 
provocative . . . challenging scholars to rethink views that have for too long 
been taken for granted." -- Hock. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Powell has proposed solutions which demand to be taken seriously. I like 
his boldness and applaud his work." -- Robert McKenzie, San Francisco 
Theological Seminary. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, who used personal funds to publish the book after spending two years 
writing it, has come to like the Jesus he describes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a charismatic individual, brave, willing to challenge authority," 
Powell said. "He inspired people to follow him and he put his life on the line 
for what he believed."

JUDGE SETS STAGE FOR BATTLE OVER SOKA CAMPUS SITE; COURT: SCHOOL'S LAST

 After nearly two years of preliminary skirmishes, a judge this week cleared 
the way for Soka University and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy to face 
off in a key fight over the school's scenic Calabasas campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides meet Nov. 23 in Los Angeles Superior Court to argue whether the 
conservancy has the right to condemn a part of Soka's campus at Mulholland 
Highway and Las Virgenes Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hearing in November is the prize fight," Soka spokesman Jeff Ourvan said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy staff counsel Liz Cheadle agreed, saying, "This is big, big." 
</P>
<P>
 If a judge determines that the conservancy -- a state agency that acquires 
parkland -- has the right to take 245 acres of Soka's property, the case will 
then go to a jury to decide how much the school should be paid for the land. 
</P>
<P>
 November's hearing is a critical point in the eminent domain case, coming two 
years after the conservancy initially began condemnation proceedings in late 
1992. The delay resulted from a series of legal challenges that have cost both 
sides hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ruling released Friday, Judge Robert H. O'Brien threw out the last of 
several challenges filed by Soka in its effort to fight the conservancy's 
condemnation. In its latest challenge, the school argued that the conservancy 
should have conducted an environmental analysis of the condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
 The school argued such a review was necessary because, it claimed, the 
conservancy intends to sell the property to the National Park Service to use as 
a visitors' center for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Brien said no review was required because the conservancy intends to 
essentially preserve the site, which includes the historic estate built by 
shaving razor magnate King Gillette. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka's Ourvan said the school will appeal O'Brien's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 When Soka and conservancy lawyers finally do present their cases before Judge 
Barnet Cooperman, their arguments will sound familiar. Soka lawyers will argue, 
as they did in 1992 before a different judge, that the conservancy violated 
state law when it began condemnation proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 The condemnation is being pursued by an arm of the conservancy called the 
Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority. Because the authority has a 
joint powers agreement with two Ventura County parks agencies, it received 
permission from that county's Board of Supervisors to begin the condemnation -- 
even though Soka is entirely within Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka lawyers argue that the approval is invalid, and that permission should 
have come from the state Board of Public Works, which signs off on condemnation 
attempts by state agencies such as the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ventura County judge agreed with Soka in 1992, but she was overturned by the 
state Court of Appeal, which ruled that the school should raise its objections 
during the hearing scheduled for Nov. 23.

TWO POLICE VEHICLES COLLIDE DURING CHASE; OFFICER HURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A motorcycle officer was injured Friday when he collided with a police car as 
both vehicles chased the driver of a stolen car. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Howard Eisenberg, 41, suffered facial cuts and a broken nose in the 
collision near West Coast Highway and Riverside Avenue about 3:30 p.m., police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another motorcycle officer had begun the chase after seeing the driver make an 
illegal U-turn on West Coast Highway near Newport Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the car, a Mitsubishi Eclipse Turbo reported stolen from Big 
Bear Lake on Oct. 6, led police in and out of Costa Mesa, with the two 
motorcycles and police car in pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 A short time after the police car and motorcycle collided, the fleeing vehicle 
was trapped by other officers in the 2000 block of Aliso Avenue in Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Andy Gonis said the driver, Christopher Foster, 21, of San Bernardino, 
ran from the car and tossed away a bag containing a loaded weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 He was tracked by helicopter and arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 A passenger, Adrian Rosu, 22, of Grand Terrace, also was arrested on suspicion 
of auto theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonis said that "additional evidence possibly linking them to other crimes" 
was recovered from the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men were being held at the Newport Beach Jail.

NHL OWNERS, PLAYERS NO CLOSER TO SETTLING; PRO HOCKEY: AS LEAGUE PREPARES TO 
CANCEL MORE GAMES, UNION REJECTS OFFER TO EXAMINE BOOKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In moves that add up to no foreseeable end to the lockout, an NHL spokesman 
said Friday that more games will be canceled and the players' association 
rejected an offer to look into management's books. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Friday, 154 games -- 14.1% of the 1,092-game schedule -- had been 
missed. However, the league has canceled only four games from each club's 
84-game schedule, saying that games might be rescheduled. Announcing more 
cancellations -- the actual canceling will be done Monday and might erase 10 
games per team -- is a concession that the season will be greatly curtailed 
when, or if, it begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on building availability, we lose the ability to reschedule," said 
Brian Burke, the NHL's director of hockey operations. "I can't see how it (the 
cancellation) can be less than double digits. The games are gone and the 
players' salaries, to that point, are forfeited." 
</P>
<P>
 The league and the union will meet next week, but they are attempting to keep 
the date and site secret to avoid media scrutiny. They last met Monday in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Management's last offer called for the league to agree to play while 
independent auditors tried to verify the NHL's claim of a $32-million loss in 
1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously and without any doubt we have no interest in their proposal," said 
Bob Goodenow, executive director of the NHLPA. "And we are still waiting for a 
reply to our request for financial data." 
</P>
<P>
 A league source said it provided that information long ago, but Goodenow had 
ignored it. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the players are chafing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been playing hockey for 30 years and now I am not playing and I am 
frustrated," said the Kings' Wayne Gretzky, who is organizing a goodwill tour 
of Europe in December. "I literally hate it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings' Marty McSorley is recruiting players for a benefit game Nov. 6 in 
Belleville, Canada, where he played junior hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Hull of the St. Louis Blues said he will propose at an NHLPA meeting 
Wednesday in Toronto that players make another no-strike pledge. Their first 
pledge was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to see if the guys will offer our 'Let's play' package again, and 
see if it can't get worked out," Hull told The St. Louis Post Dispatch.

COMMENTARY; EVEN THOUGH IT PLAYS ON, NBA COULD BE HEADED FOR TROUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bus pulled out of the Bradley Center about three o'clock Milwaukee time, 
not so long after it was announced at a news conference in New York that 
something amazing will happen in a week: A professional sports season, the 
NBA's in this case, will start on time. The bus carrying the Bucks went out on 
North 4th Street and then over to Kilbourn and then to I-43, the road that 
would take the Bucks to an exhibition game Thursday night in Green Bay against 
the Minnesota Timberwolves.  
</P>
<P>
 It was another preseason bus that did not have Glenn (Big Dog) Robinson, the 
Bucks' No. 1 draft choice, on it. They might have postponed trouble for a year 
in the NBA yesterday, but that bus going up I-43 was a symbol of a league 
headed straight for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bucks have offered Robinson a nine-year contract worth $60 million. 
Robinson has swatted that one away, into the seats, like some weak jump shot. 
His agent, Dr. Charles Tucker, keeps talking about a contract 12 years long, or 
maybe even 15, with automatic salary increases built in. Tucker never actually 
mentions the figure $100 million to Mike Dunleavy and John Steinmiller, who run 
the business side for the Bucks. But the number is always there between them. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunleavy is vice president of basketball operations for the Bucks, in addition 
to being coach. He did some quick figuring the very first time Tucker talked 
about a contract that could go for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Tucker, if my math is correct, we'd be talking about a contract worth 
$105 million," Dunleavy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker, according to Dunleavy, smiled. Perhaps he smiled like the Cheshire cat 
in "Alice in Wonderland." Which is exactly where Mike Dunleavy thought he was 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, is that what it would be?" Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
 This was before the Bucks played their first exhibition game. The regular 
season starts next Friday. Robinson still is unsigned. He could have been home 
in Gary, Ind., shooting hoops Thursday. Or there was some talk he might be 
shooting around somewhere with Juwan Howard, the No. 1 draft choice of the 
Bullets, also unsigned. Howard has turned down a contract from the Bullets that 
would pay him about $37,000 per game for the next 10 years. That contract is 
pocket change compared to what the Bucks are offering Robinson. If he signs for 
what Milwaukee is offering, he will be paid $81,300 per game by the Bucks until 
the year 2003. 
</P>
<P>
 David Stern, the NBA commissioner, and Charles Grantham, the executive 
director for the NBA Players Assn., have agreed to play this season without a 
new collective-bargaining agreement between the owners and players. The NHL did 
the same thing last season and never made a deal and now there is no hockey the 
way there is no baseball. Basketball already has a salary cap in place. Hockey 
and baseball do not. The basketball players already have gone to court once, 
trying to have the salary cap declared illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA owners will not only fight in court, but to the death, to not only 
keep the salary cap, but to put more teeth into it. They do not only want a cap 
for veteran players, they want one for rookies, so that they are not forced to 
pay any more players like Jason Kidd of the Mavericks and Grant Hill of the 
Pistons contracts worth $54 and $45 million, respectively. Anfernee Hardaway of 
the Magic, a second-year player, has a new $70-million contract, with $45 
million guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was Grantham, negotiating even as he said Thursday's news conference 
was not a negotiating session, saying this about David Stern: "We hope that 
(Stern) will realize that a salary cap is not necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 And when somebody talked about Glenn Robinson and raised the issue of a rookie 
cap, Grantham said, "We don't believe a cap within a cap is the answer." 
</P>
<P>
 The owners sure do. The owners now see a player who starts negotiating down 
from $100 million and wonder where next year's No. 1 will start. There is no 
sport where one player can make more of a difference than basketball. A long 
time ago, we saw that in Milwaukee when the No. 1 draft choice was Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar. Now the Bucks, who only won 20 games last season, are hoping Big 
Dog Robinson can turn everything around for them the way Abdul-Jabbar did. But 
the game, at least when money is changing hands, has changed since 1969. There 
is no other sport where someone's whole career is guaranteed before he walks 
out of the locker room and proves he can do anything. 
</P>
<P>
 So Robinson is in Gary, or wherever he is. A deal worth $81,300 per game into 
the next century sits on the table. And once again, you wonder where this all 
ends, if it does not end with the kind of bitter trouble we have now in 
baseball and hockey. All the NBA bought was a year's worth of time, at a time 
when $60 million does not buy you the top pick in the draft. It is supposed to 
be a big joke that the value of the Bucks' franchise is not worth much more 
than the offer made to Robinson. It is no joke, no matter how much everybody 
was smiling in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in the dark days of a negotiation going nowhere," Steinmiller, the 
Bucks' vice president for business affairs, said. Then Steinmiller, one of the 
good guys in the NBA for a long time, said, "To be $40 million apart is a 
little depressing, I'm not going to lie to you. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to get into a fight with Glenn Robinson. We don't want to make 
him out to be a bad guy. But the unfortunate thing is that he's being made to 
feel as if he and his agent are being very reasonable."  
</P>
<P>
 Steinmiller made a sound that tried to be a laugh but never made it. "We don't 
fault them for making this kind of demand. We just fault them for sticking to 
it, frankly." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunleavy told me a few weeks ago the Bucks would eventually have to go public 
with their offer, just so their fans would understand they were not negotiating 
with Robinson on the cheap. The Bucks did that. They talk about nine years with 
Tucker and he talks about more. Tucker has told Dunleavy, "We don't want to 
have to negotiate again in six years," making that sound as insulting a 
proposition to Glenn Robinson as having to clip coupons. 
</P>
<P>
 "He keeps coming back to two key words," Dunleavy said. "And those two key 
words are 'lifetime contract.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Dunleavy is from East Flatbush, in Brooklyn. Dunleavy's first contract with 
the 76ers after South Carolina was for $35,000. A long way from East Flatbush, 
his own contract with the Bucks is worth more than a million a year. He has 
shared in the growth of the NBA the way everybody has. Now he negotiates a 
contract with a kid fresh out of Purdue that feels more like a corporate 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
 "You tell me where this all is going to end," Dunleavy said, "because I sure 
would like to know." 
</P>
<P>
 It ends with terrible trouble for the NBA. All they did Thursday was get out 
of the way. Like people avoiding a bus.

MCDONNELL TO SHARE REVERSAL OF FORTUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas Corp., giving stockholders a long-awaited bonus for the 
aerospace giant's recovery, Friday announced a 71% dividend increase, a 3-for-1 
stock split and a buyback of 15% of its common shares after the split. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, McDonnell's stock soared $15.625 a share to a record high of $141 
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, giving the stock buyback a 
current value of $846 million. Volume was a heavy 611,800 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street had looked for McDonnell to boost its shareholders' returns for 
the past several months, because of the sharp rebound in the St. Louis-based 
company's financial health since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebound had fueled a surge in the price of McDonnell's stock, which traded 
as low as $34 a share two years ago. McDonnell Douglas itself had indicated it 
might return some of its substantial cash flow to investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was better late than never, and it shows in the price of the stock," said 
Gary J. Reich, an analyst at Prudential Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Notably, McDonnell's board took the actions only a month after it hired 
outsider Harry C. Stonecipher as chief executive -- a manager known for his 
emphasis on improving shareholders' investments. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview, Stonecipher denied being the catalyst for Friday's 
announcement, saying it showed "that the company's performance is very strong. 
I happened to be the lucky guy that's here." 
</P>
<P>
 But Reich said Stonecipher's arrival no doubt played a role. "The combination 
of things going their way, coupled with the new person in charge, made it the 
right time," Reich said. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell, which employs more than 20,000 people in Long Beach and Huntington 
Beach at its commercial jetliner, C-17 military transport and space systems 
programs, said the actions include: 
</P>
<P>
 * A 3-for-1 stock split to shareholders of record as of Dec. 2. That will 
increase McDonnell's total common shares outstanding to 118.5 million from 39.5 
million.  
</P>
<P>
 * After the split, McDonnell will pay a quarterly dividend of 20 cents a 
share, payable Jan. 3 to holders of record as of Dec. 2. The current quarterly 
payout is 35 cents a share.  
</P>
<P>
 * McDonnell will buy back up to 18 million of the post-split shares in 
periodic open-market or private purchases, or through tender offers. 
</P>
<P>
 The actions cap a comeback McDonnell engineered with aggressive cost cutting, 
including the elimination of more than 60,000 jobs -- or 45% of its work force 
-- since mid-1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts enabled McDonnell, despite a big drop in Pentagon spending, to 
bolster its profits and generate more than $1 billion in cash during the past 
two years, which was partly used to slash its debt. The cuts also helped 
McDonnell's struggling Douglas Aircraft jetliner business stay profitable 
despite a slump in orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Stonecipher has said his priorities include rejuvenating Douglas, which made 
some investors nervous because they worried Stonecipher would pour McDonnell's 
cash into the ailing unit instead of giving some to shareholders, said Byron K. 
Callan, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 But the actions Friday allayed those fears by showing "there's going to be a 
balance here" in how McDonnell invests its surplus cash, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Stonecipher confirmed that "we're probably going to build" 
Douglas' proposed 100-seat jetliner, the MD-95, somewhere other than Douglas' 
home plant in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to be more specific, but sources have said an outside firm will 
probably assemble the plane in Dallas.

NOT A WARM, CUDDLY BUSINESS; PET FOOD RIVALRY PUTS PRESSURE ON FIRMS TO 
CONSOLIDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For decades in the pet food industry, companies battled for market share in 
relatively polite fashion, as industry giants such as Ralston Purina, Nestle 
and Mars behaved like well-mannered dogs gathered around a heaping bowl of 
chow. 
</P>
<P>
 But the market has changed considerably in recent years. Competition from 
high-priced premium brands has intensified, grocery stores have lost pet food 
sales to alternative outlets, and growth in the pet population has slowed. 
</P>
<P>
 With tensions rising, analysts say, expect skirmishes, and look for the big 
dogs to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Nestle USA Inc., the Glendale-based maker of Friskies and Mighty Dog pet 
foods, started bulking up last month when it agreed to acquire Alpo Petfoods 
from London-based Grand Metropolitan for $510 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1988, Nestle's share of the $8.4-billion pet food industry has fallen 
from 12.7% to 11.5%. The purchase of Alpo would make Nestle top dog, surpassing 
by 0.1 percentage point the 17% market share held by longtime industry leader 
Ralston Purina. And it would give Nestle a popular dog food brand to augment 
its already-strong cat food sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts applauded the deal as a much-needed closing of the ranks, but said 
there's plenty of room for further consolidation. In the not-too-distant 
future, analysts said, many companies will have to decide whether to join 
Nestle in building up or Grand Met in getting out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would seem logical to expect more deals in the future," said Les Pugh, a 
pet food industry analyst at Salomon Bros. in New York. "There are too many 
players, and too much money invested in too many factories with too much 
distribution." 
</P>
<P>
 The winnowing-out process could take years, Pugh said, but eventually the pet 
food industry ought to look a bit more like the $8-billion breakfast cereal 
industry, in which three companies -- Kellogg, General Mills and Post -- hold a 
combined 80% market share in the United States. In contrast, the top three pet 
food companies -- Nestle, Ralston and Mars, the maker of Kal Kan -- together 
account for more than 37% of domestic sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Such fragmentation has persisted for decades because companies such as Nestle 
have had little incentive to unload or expand pet food divisions that typically 
have required little attention while producing steady revenue growth. But the 
pet food market has been upended over the past 10 years by a number of forces, 
including the emergence of long-dormant premium brands that have gobbled up 
huge chunks of market share. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's Pet Nutrition Inc., for example, was barely a blip on the industry 
radar a decade ago. But by last year, the company had $660 million in sales and 
almost 8% of the market, much of it gained at the expense of Ralston Purina, 
Nestle and others. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? Some say the fitness craze finally hit pets. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's is one of several so-called premium pet food brands that claim to be 
more nutritious than traditional brands because they contain higher-quality 
grains and fewer fillers and animal byproducts. But nutrition comes at a hefty 
price. At Big Al's, a large pet supply store in Granada Hills, a 40-pound bag 
of Hill's Science Diet dog food typically sells for about $25, compared to just 
$12 for an equal amount of Purina Dog Chow. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, most consumers, and even many veterinarians, saw little reason 
to spend the extra money. But today, "you've got people more concerned about 
their own diet, and that transfers to their pet," said Tim Phillips, a 
veterinarian who is editor of Pet Food Industry magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's, a unit of Colgate-Palmolive Co., has emerged as the leading premium 
brand partly by capitalizing on a relationship with veterinarians that the 
company has cultivated since 1948, when it introduced its Prescription Diet 
foods for animals with heart or kidney disease. Until a few years ago, Hill's 
sold virtually all its food through veterinarians, who pocketed up to a third 
of the sales price on each bag or can. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, even though Hill's is now sold mostly through pet stores, its Science 
Diet brand is widely recommended by veterinarians, and health-conscious 
consumers are following doctors' orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Iams, another premium brand, has similarly capitalized on its status as a 
favorite among breeders, from whom many Americans get their puppies and 
kittens. Iams, which was tiny 10 years ago, had 1993 sales of $350 million and 
held a 4.1% market share. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralston Purina, Nestle and other major pet food makers have introduced their 
own premium brands in recent years. But sales of those products have foundered, 
partly because these companies lack credentials with veterinarians and breeders 
and also because they have been shut out by specialty retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past 10 years, grocery stores have watched their share of retail pet 
food sales in the United States slip from 95% to 55%, said John Maxwell, an 
analyst at Wheat First Securities in Richmond, Va. That's bad news for Ralston, 
Nestle and other industry leaders who have traditionally relied almost 
exclusively on grocery store sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Mass merchandisers, including Price Club, Wal-Mart and Costco, have picked up 
some of the business. In fact, Wal-Mart has acquired almost 6% of the retail 
pet food market through sales of its in-house brand, Ol' Roy, named for the dog 
of Wal-Mart's founder, the late Sam Walton. Also, as much as a quarter of all 
pet food is now purchased through burgeoning pet shop chains, some of which 
refuse to carry grocery store brands. 
</P>
<P>
 Petco, the second-largest U.S. pet store chain, has nearly doubled in size, 
from 115 stores in 1988 to 205 stores today, and not one of them carries 
Nestle, Ralston Purina or other grocery store brands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We threw them out to differentiate ourselves," said Brian Devine, chief 
executive of San Diego-based Petco. Instead, the company serves as an outlet 
for premium brands that aren't available at grocery stores, including Hill's, 
Iams and Nutro. 
</P>
<P>
 The outlook for Nestle, Ralston Purina and others has been further hampered by 
signs that the pet population is not growing as fast as it once was. The number 
of American households with dogs has decreased slightly over the past six 
years, while cat-owning households have increased about 11% during the same 
period, according to the Richmond, Va.-based Maxwell Report, an annual 
newsletter that tracks pet industry and other retailing trends. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say more consolidation is inevitable. Quaker Oats Co. is rumored to 
be looking for a buyer for its pet food division, which makes Cycle and Kibbles 
'N Bits dog food. Dozens of regional companies with tiny market shares are also 
considered acquisition targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Likely suitors include the large and well-known food producers that must find 
ways to regain lost ground. Like Nestle, other industry heavyweights have seen 
their shares of total pet food sales decline: Ralston Purina's has slipped from 
27.2% in 1998 to 17%; Mars has fallen from 10.7% to 8.8%. Even with Alpo, 
Nestle has already signaled it may still have some shopping to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are continually looking for opportunities to grow our business," said Joe 
Weller, chief executive of Nestle USA, "whether through new products or 
acquisitions." Dog Eat Dog 
</P>
<P>
 Premium brands, such as those made by Hill's, Iams and Nutro, have come out of 
nowhere to take a significant share of the $8.4-billion U.S. pet food market. 
That has put pressure on more established competitors such as Ralston Purina 
and Nestle. 1993 market share based on revenue: Ralston Purina: 17% Nestle*: 
11.5 Kal Kan (Mars): 8.8 Heinz: 7.9 Hill's: 7.8 Quaker Oats: 5.8 Ol' Roy: 5.7 
Alpo*: 5.6 Iams: 4.1 Nutro: 2.1 Others: 23.7 
</P>
<P>
 * Nestle is in the process of acquiring Alpo; if successful, Nestle would edge 
past Ralston Purina with a 17.1% share of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 PET OWNERSHIP 
</P>
<P>
 Further pressuring pet food makers is slower growth in the number of pets. 
Number of U.S. households owning dogs and cats, in millions: 
</P>
<P>
 Dogs: 36.3 
</P>
<P>
 Cats: 31.7 
</P>
<P>
 PET FOOD SALES 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of dog and cat food continue to grow steadily, but premium brands 
account for an increasing amount of the gain through their greater market share 
and higher prices. Sales figures, in billions of dollars: 
</P>
<P>
 1993 
</P>
<P>
 Dog food: $5.0 
</P>
<P>
 Cat food: $3.4

 If you can't tolerate the home and auto insurance industry or don't understand 
the coverage, you have plenty of company. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer than half of all Americans think favorably of home and auto insurers, 
according to a new industry survey.And about three in 10 of those questioned 
flat out can't stand them. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey also found that more than eight in 10 Americans who buy homeowners 
or auto insurance don't fully comprehend the terms of their policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurers pointed out that they are less despised now than in the past. The 
percentage of Americans who think favorably about the companies rose to 45% 
this year. That's a four-point increase from last year and the highest 
favorable rating in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The study also found that the more educated and wealthy Americans are, the 
more they dislike home and auto insurers. The only industry to be held in lower 
esteem: consumer finance.

WITNESS SAYS HE CAUGHT SPIEGEL WITH $7 MILLION; TRIAL: THE FORMER GENERAL 
COUNSEL OF THE NOW-DEFUNCT THRIFT TESTIFIES THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE WENT 
'BALLISTIC' WHEN CONFRONTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the most damaging testimony yet in the week-old trial of former Columbia 
Savings & Loan boss Thomas Spiegel, the former general counsel of the 
now-defunct financial institution testified Friday that Spiegel tried to keep 
$7 million in profits that rightly belonged to Columbia and became enraged when 
confronted with evidence of the alleged deception. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Heitz, who was hired as Columbia's general counsel in 1988, also said 
Spiegel threatened him when he asked Spiegel to return some guns the banker 
took from Columbia's headquarters in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitz's testimony shed new light on many of the 45 criminal charges that the 
U.S. attorney's office has filed against Spiegel, who the government claims 
used his power as the thrift's chief executive to enrich himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel resigned at the end of 1989, and the institution was seized by 
regulators in early 1991. The failure is expected to cost taxpayers about $1.3 
billion, making it the third-costliest thrift bailout in history. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Heitz's testimony Friday revolved around Spiegel's $132,000 investment 
in special warrants that that were created when the investment firm of 
Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co. purchased Storer Communications in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia purchased about $86 million in junk bonds needed to finance the sale 
through Drexel Burnham Lambert and its junk bond king, Michael Milken, a close 
friend of Spiegel's who later pleaded guilty to securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 After the deal was completed, Heitz said, he learned that Spiegel had secretly 
invested $132,000 in potentially lucrative warrants for Storer stock. Though 
Spiegel invested his own money, Heitz said Columbia -- not Spiegel -- should 
have had the opportunity to buy the warrants as its bonus for putting $86 
million into the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel also never told Columbia's board about the existence of the warrants, 
Heitz said. When the attorney discovered a prospectus for the offering and 
confronted Spiegel with it, Heitz said, the banker flew into a rage. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Ballistic' " would probably be a good description," Heitz testified, adding 
that the value of the warrants had by then climbed to about $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitz said he asked Spiegel to transfer the warrants to Columbia and that 
Spiegel complied shortly after conferring with his personal attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitz also testified that when Spiegel was pushing for a series of 
multimillion-dollar loans and renewals for a friend of his, auto dealer Howard 
Schneider, Spiegel objected to the lawyer's request for a background check of 
Schneider and his finances. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution maintains that Spiegel wanted Schneider to get the loans so 
the banker could continue driving Schneider's luxury cars for free, and because 
Spiegel eventually hoped to gain a half-interest in the dealership by using 
Columbia's money instead of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 The government alleges that Columbia lost more than $10 million when Schneider 
eventually defaulted. The auto dealer has since pleaded guilty to two counts of 
defrauding Columbia and is expected to testify against Spiegel next month. 
</P>
<P>
 John F. Walsh, the government's lead prosecutor, also asked Heitz to recount 
his efforts to recover several Columbia-owned firearms Spiegel had taken to his 
home after he resigned in 1989. Spiegel has said he needed the guns at the 
headquarters for security reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitz said that when he asked Spiegel to give the guns back in early 1990, 
Spiegel once again grew angry and threatened him. Walsh's efforts to have Heitz 
describe the threat were halted after Spiegel's attorney objected to the 
question.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW SOARS 55 ON ROSY GDP-INFLATION REPORT; MARKETS: THE 
THIRD-QUARTER FIGURES ALSO HELP PUSH BOND RATES BACK BELOW THE 8% LEVEL. THE 
DOLLAR REBOUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Stocks rallied Friday while long-term bond interest rates fell below the 
crucial 8% level for the first time in a week, after a government report on 
third-quarter economic activity contained no disturbing signs of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average surged 55.51 points to 3,930.66, its best 
level since Oct. 19 and its biggest one-day gain since Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Stock Exchange activated its limit on program trading when the 
index gained 50 points. Friday's gain pushed the Dow up 39.36 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the Treasury's main 30-year bond yield retreated to 7.95% 
from 8.05% on Thursday, pushing its price up 1 1/16 points, or $10.63 per 
$1,000 in face value. The yield and the price move in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
 The catalyst for the gains in both markets was a Commerce Department report on 
the nation's third-quarter gross domestic product, which surged 3.4%, while the 
implicit price deflator -- an inflation gauge that measures price changes in a 
basket of goods -- rose at a 1.6% annual rate compared to 2.9% in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing evidence that the economy is expanding at a reasonably strong 
pace, but inflation . . . is still very low," said Hugh Johnson, First Albany 
Corp.'s market strategist. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said the report may not dissuade the Federal Reserve Board from 
raising interest rates at its policy-making meeting in mid-November, as had 
been widely expected. Most analysts expect a tightening of 0.50 percentage 
points at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 But the data called into question whether the central bank would have to 
tighten credit a second time before the first of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Market analysts said the news of moderate inflation increased the allure of 
long-term bonds, particularly after yields punched through 8% earlier this week 
for the first time in about 2 1/2 years. Investors were encouraged that bond 
returns would not be sacrificed to higher consumer prices in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
 Also lifting the mood of both stock and bond investors was the fact that a 
large portion of the gain in the GDP was in inventories. Economists expect U.S. 
companies to throttle back on production while these are worked off. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks also got a lift from a recovering dollar. Advancing strongly against 
the German mark, the greenback closed in New York at 1.509 marks, up from 1.499 
on Thursday. It rose to 97.28 Japanese yen, up from 96.98. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent surge in interest rates in the inflation-wary bond market had sent 
the Dow average on a five-session losing streak of nearly 88 points. But the 
downturn in stocks ended Thursday with a 27-point rebound in the industrials. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors focused on strong third-quarter earnings that continued to flow in 
Friday from companies such as oil services firm Halliburton Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's letting the earnings power start to show through," said Ron Hill, 
investment strategist at Brown Bros. Harriman, of the drop in the long bond 
yield. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, meanwhile, rising stocks outnumbered decliners by 
nearly 8 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled a hefty 
381.58 million shares, up from 327.78 million the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 Relieved investors went on a buying spree, pushing broad-market indexes 
sharply higher as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The NYSE's composite index rose 3.86 points to 259.43, while the Standard & 
Poor's 500-stock index rose 7.92 points to 473.77. The Nasdaq composite index 
of mostly smaller companies rose 8.68 points to 776.15. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is part of an equity celebration," said Thomas McManus, equity 
strategist at Morgan Stanley & Co., who said the GDP data showed "the best of 
both worlds: solid growth, low inflation and expanding profits." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just come through a third-quarter reporting period where earnings 
surprised even the optimists," McManus said. "There doesn't seem to be any 
negative impact on the economic growth rate of higher interest rates." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Halliburton posted third-quarter earnings that were well above analysts' 
forecasts, sparking a rally in the oil service group. Halliburton surged 4 1/8 
to 36 1/4, Baker Hughes jumped 1 3/8 to 20 3/4 and Schlumberger rose 2 5/8 to 
58 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * McDonnell Douglas gained 15 5/8 to 141. It said it was boosting its 
quarterly dividend 71% and splitting its stock 3-for-1. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hercules soared 10 1/2 to 117 3/8. Hercules and Alliant Techsystems Inc. 
said they expect to sign an agreement Monday in which Alliant will acquire the 
aerospace operations of Hercules for $412 million. Alliant rose 4 3/4 to 34 
1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ventritex, a maker of implantable defibrillators, leaped 3 3/4 to 27 1/2 
after receiving a key labeling approval from the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks extended their rally, with IBM up 2 to 76 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Airlines rose as well, based on attractive earnings reports released earlier 
this week. UAL surged 6 to 95. 
</P>
<P>
 * Financial stocks also rose as the imminent threat of higher interest rates 
receded. BankAmerica rose 1 1/8 to 43 3/4. Merrill Lynch added 1 7/8 to 39 7/8. 
The Federal National Mortgage Assn. climbed 2 1/4 to 77 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks were mixed in overseas trading. London's FTSE 100-share average soared 
54.2 points to 3,083.8. In Frankfurt, the DAX average gained 27.12 points to 
end at 2,040.32. Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average edged up 8.80 points to 
19,805.16. In Mexico City, the Bolsa index ended 20.77 points lower at 
2,571.52.

ATLANTIC RECORDS PRESIDENT TAPPED FOR WARNER CHAIR; MUSIC: OFFER IS LATEST 
TWIST IN TUMULT AT THE LABEL. SOURCES SAY DANNY GOLDBERG IS LIKELY TO TAKE THE 
JOB AT WARNER BROS. RECORDS.

<P>
 The roller-coaster ride at Warner Music Group took another sudden turn Friday 
with Danny Goldberg, president of Warner's Atlantic Records label, being 
offered the chairmanship of Warner Bros. Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg declined to comment. But sources said the 44-year-old former manager 
of such top acts as Bonnie Raitt and Nirvana was likely to take the job -- 
though he had not made a decision yet. 
</P>
<P>
 The job offer follows a tumultuous power struggle at Time Warner Inc.'s New 
York headquarters that resulted Thursday in Doug Morris being elevated to 
chairman and chief executive of Warner Music's U.S. operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris offered Goldberg the Warner Bros. Records chairmanship less than an 
hour after wresting control of the $5.4-billion Warner Music Group's domestic 
music division away from company Chairman Robert J. Morgado.  
</P>
<P>
 Sources say Morgado had planned to hire Britain-based Warner executive Rob 
Dickins -- who flew to New York early Thursday to flesh out contract details -- 
over the objections of Morris. Morgado's duties are now said to be limited to 
overseeing Warner Music's international and record club operations. 
</P>
<P>
 If Goldberg accepts the position, he would not report to work at Burbank-based 
Warner Bros. Records until industry titan Mo Ostin steps down in January. There 
is speculation that Warner Bros. Records President Lenny Waronker, who Monday 
turned down an offer to become chairman of the label, will follow Ostin out the 
door if contract negotiations permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry reaction to Goldberg's appointment Friday was mostly positive. 
Goldberg is respected for his sensitivity to artists and for orchestrating a 
series of deals with promising independent labels such as Matador, Mammoth and 
Rhino, thus helping to bolster Atlantic's rock credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 Within Warner Bros. Records, however, there is some resentment toward 
Goldberg, whom sources accused of orchestrating a campaign to undermine the 
image of Ostin and the label within the Warner Music Group. 
</P>
<P>
 The next item on Morris' agenda is to complete the purchase of Interscope 
Records, which would become an equal partner in the Warner Music Group with 
Warner Bros. Records, Elektra Entertainment and Atlantic Group.

 Alliant Techsystems Inc. Near $412-Million Deal With Hercules: The company's 
announcement that it expects to reach an agreement Monday to acquire the 
aerospace operations of Hercules Inc. sent the stocks of both companies 
soaring.Hercules leaped $8.125 to $115 on the New York Stock Exchange, while 
Alliant was up $3.25 to $32.75, also on the NYSE. Alliant supplies defense 
storage systems to the government and other organizations. Hercules makes 
specialty chemicals, food products and solid fuel systems for the aerospace 
industry. The purchase price consists of $300 million in cash, less $14 million 
paid by Alliant in July when it signed a letter of intent, and 3.86 million new 
shares of Alliant stock valued at $29 a share.

 Aetna Profit Plummets: Aetna Life & Casualty said its third-quarter earnings 
declined 43% as the company added to its reserves for pollution claims and 
raised its estimates of catastrophe costs. Aetna earned $129 million, or $1.15 
a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with $226 million, or 
$2.03 a share, last year.Revenue was $4.39 billion, up from $4.33 billion a 
year ago. The insurance company, based in Hartford, Conn., said it had to add 
$23 million in the quarter to its reserves for environmental claims and 
moderately raise its estimate of costs from the Los Angeles earthquake and 
severe winter weather earlier this year. Catastrophe costs were $28 million in 
the quarter, compared to $18 million a year ago. Capital losses also took a 
toll on overall earnings and resulted in a $2.2-million loss in the commercial 
property-casualty business for the quarter.

 Greyhound Seeks Cash and Restructuring: The bus lines company said it may run 
out of cash this winter and faces a bankruptcy filing if bondholders refuse to 
approve its plan to swap debt for common stock.The warning, in a proxy 
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, follows a proposal 
by Greyhound to exchange $98.9 million of outstanding 8.5% convertible 
debentures that mature in 2007 for 9.9 million common shares. The bondholders 
have offered their own plan to swap debt for stock, but Greyhound turned it 
down. However, both sides said they have laid the groundwork for further 
negotiations.

 Help-Wanted Ads Decline: Reflecting a slowdown in employer demand for new 
workers after strong gains over the summer, the Conference Board's help-wanted 
advertising index dropped to 117 in September from 119 in August. Still, the 
index is 17 points higher than it was during the same time a year 
ago.Calculated from a base of 100, the index is derived by measuring the 
monthly volume of employment advertising in 51 newspapers around the country. 
It is considered a useful barometer for gauging the local, regional and 
national supply of jobs. Economist Kenneth Goldstein said the slight drop in 
the index doesn't indicate a halt to economic recovery, but rather a typical 
slowdown from an average of 300,000 new jobs in June and July.

 Lawsuit Expanded Against Tobacco Firms: The suit, which alleges that major 
cigarette makers concealed the addictive nature of nicotine in their products, 
now covers all U.S. smokers who were unable to quit smoking.The suit was 
initiated by six smokers and seeks a stunning $200 billion in compensatory and 
punitive damages from tobacco companies. The case hinges on addiction claims 
rather than physical harm, the line of argument pursued in past smoking 
lawsuits. Dade Circuit Judge Harold Solomon in Miami ruled that he would 
certify the case as a class-action suit covering all people who have died or 
become ill from smoking-related diseases. The defendants include R.J. Reynolds, 
Philip Morris, Lorillard, American Tobacco, Brown & Williamson and Liggett 
Group.

 Japan Buying 2 More AWACS, Boeing Says: The Seattle-based aerospace company 
said the government order is worth $773 million.The surveillance planes are 
767s made in Everett, north of Seattle, and modified with airborne warning and 
control system equipment at Boeing Co.'s plant in Wichita, Kan. Japan ordered 
its first two AWACS in 1993. They will be delivered in 1998. Those ordered in 
the new transaction will be delivered in 1999. The planes are used by the 
United States and its allies as an airborne radar platform to monitor planes 
and ships over a wide area.

PAINEWEBBER SUES TWO RIVALS FOR ALLEGED 'RAID' ON KIDDER BROKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 PaineWebber Group Inc. said Friday that it is suing two rival Wall Street 
firms for allegedly trying to lure Kidder, Peabody Co.'s top brokers away 
before PaineWebber acquires the financially troubled company. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate lawsuits, PaineWebber charges that Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. and 
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette offered "exorbitant" financial incentives to 
Kidder brokers in a corporate "raid." 
</P>
<P>
 PaineWebber said it is seeking a court order to stop both firms from 
continuing their actions. 
</P>
<P>
 DLJ, a unit of Equitable Cos., scoffed at the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Contrary to what PaineWebber believes, the 13th Amendment abolished 
involuntary servitude. Kidder brokers have a right to go where they want," a 
DLJ spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said DLJ did not initiate any contact with Kidder professionals and "only 
responded to incoming phone calls." 
</P>
<P>
 A Dean Witter spokeswoman said the firm had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, General Electric Co. said it would sell Kidder, which it 
bought in 1986, to PaineWebber for shares worth $670 million. 
</P>
<P>
 PaineWebber has been eyeing Kidder's 1,150-strong retail sales force -- the 
most profitable in the business -- as a way to expand its brokerage network. 
</P>
<P>
 However, DLJ has hired nine Kidder brokers this year.

U.S. WARNS JAPAN ON DELAYS OVER TRADE ACCORD; COMMERCE: STRONGLY WORDED LETTER 
CRITICIZES STAGNATION ON GLASS-SECTOR AND AUTO TALKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States has issued a strongly worded warning to Japan's trade chief, 
underscoring the risks of continued economic squabbling. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington has been negotiating with Tokyo to finalize an agreement to open up 
the Japanese glass sector and has sought an accord on autos and parts -- the 
single biggest component of the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 But the talks have proved tough going. 
</P>
<P>
 Should no trade deal emerge in the glass sector by Monday, according to top 
officials in the Clinton Administration, the allies would find themselves in "a 
difficult situation." 
</P>
<P>
 As for cars: "It is essential that we reach agreement," the warning says. 
</P>
<P>
 The warning was directed to Japanese Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in a 
letter dated Oct. 25 from U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and Commerce 
Secretary Ronald H. Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 A copy of the letter, whose existence was first reported in a Japanese 
newspaper Friday, was obtained by Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor and Brown wrote Hashimoto in reply to two letters he sent them earlier 
this month, thanking the Tokyo trade minister for his "candid comments." 
</P>
<P>
 Official sources said Hashimoto had complained about a recent speech by the 
chief U.S. car negotiator, Commerce Undersecretary Jeffrey Garten, in which he 
outlined the advantages of private-sector cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Japanese took umbrage with that speech. This letter was in response," one 
source said. No reply to the latest U.S. letter had been received, another 
official source said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the U.S. side made clear that a long-sought deal on auto trade -- which 
accounts for two-thirds of the $60-billion bilateral imbalance -- is vital to 
improved relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is essential that we reach agreement," they wrote. As for the glass 
sector, under negotiation this week, Kantor and Brown both voiced "concern at 
the pace of discussions in Tokyo. There are many issues left to resolve before 
the end of the month." 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides struck an agreement in principle Oct. 1 to open Japan's 
$4.5-billion flat-glass market and pledged to finalize the accord in 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot conclude an agreement that does not result in substantial opening 
of the glass distribution system. Failure to reach an agreement by the end of 
the month would create a difficult situation," Kantor and Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 They did not spell out what action the U.S. team might take if no accord 
emerges and reiterated that the Administration is not seeking "numerical 
targets" over glass.

UNIONFED FINANCIAL REPORTS NEW LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UnionFed Financial Corp., losing money for four straight years, got off to a 
bad start in its latest fiscal year when it reported on Friday a $3.7-million 
loss, or 14 cents a share, for its first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The holding company for Union Federal Savings Bank lost $4.1 million, or $3.10 
a share, for last year's fiscal quarter.The per-share loss was lower this year 
because the company's stock was diluted late last year in a secondary offering 
that raised $44.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss for the three months that ended Sept. 30, gives the thrift holding 
company a total of $167.3 million in red ink since it restated earnings in 1990 
to post a loss for that fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 UnionFed, which is trying to sell the savings and loan, said it had to stash 
$3.9 million in reserves for loan losses mainly because of two real estate 
loans on income properties that were reappraised and then written down to fair 
market value. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said the thrift doesn't have enough money to meet two federal 
requirements for capital adequacy -- its final reserve against losses -- but 
still meets a third requirement. The thrift fell out of compliance on the first 
two measures with its $26.5-million annual loss at the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
 David S. Engelman, the company's chairman, said the S&L continued to reduce 
bad loans and non-paying real estate, selling $9 million in the past three 
months to leave it with $54 million of troubled assets.  
</P>
<P>
 Under federal regulations, the thrift is now considered to be undercapitalized 
and last month was required to file a plan with regulators to attract more 
capital or sell the thrift.

HUFFINGTON AD ALLEGATIONS UNTRUE, NEC SAYS; POLITICS: CHARGES THE IRVINE FIRM 
HAS RECEIVED $100 MILLION IN U.S. FUNDS AND IS BEING PROBED ARE FALSE, THE 
COMPANY SAYS.

<P>
 Executives at National Education Corp. on Friday dismissed as untrue 
allegations made earlier in the week in political ads that the company has 
benefited from its largest shareholder being married to Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign advertisements that ran on radio and in newspapers were sponsored 
by Feinstein's opponent, Rep. Mike Huffington (R-Santa Barbara). Feinstein, a 
Democrat, is married to San Francisco merchant banker Richard C. Blum, who 
holds 17.6% of NEC's stock and serves on the company's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Huffington's campaign) used sound bites to paint a picture that they 
wanted to paint," NEC President Jerome Cwiertnia said Friday. "They didn't talk 
to us about the facts. I don't think they were interested in the facts." 
</P>
<P>
 The advertisements alleged that NEC, which provides training and education 
services across the country, has received $100 million in federal funds since 
Feinstein was elected to the Senate in 1992. The ads also allege that the 
Irvine-based company is "under investigation" by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Cwiertnia said that the federal investigation in question dated back to a 1988 
incident at a single NEC location in Texas. "I know for a fact that the federal 
government was satisfied with what we did in response," Cwiertnia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cwiertnia dismissed Huffington's claim that NEC has received more than $100 
million in federal funds since Feinstein was elected. "That money goes to 
students directly," he said. "Some of it goes to our schools (from students) 
but it also goes to UCI, UCLA and many other schools." 
</P>
<P>
 NEC registered its objections with Huffington's campaign through a letter, 
Cwiertnia said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really not interested in getting into this political issue," Cwiertnia 
said. "I'd be happy to talk about our business but I'm not going to get 
involved in a political commentary." 
</P>
<P>
 This past summer, NEC said it would sell a troubled education division, lay 
off about 40 corporate headquarters employees in Irvine and take a $40-million 
loss on the transaction. The company said it would stop admitting new students 
at six nationwide locations and sell 27 remaining locations to an unidentified 
buyer.

ILLEGAL HIRING ISSUE HEATS UP FOR HUFFINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Seizing on Republican challenger Mike Huffington's admission that he hired an 
illegal immigrant, Sen. Dianne Feinstein took the offensive Friday with a new 
round of ads questioning whether voters can believe or trust the Santa Barbara 
congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politician Michael Huffington talks tough about illegal immigrants but now 
Huffington admits that for years he employed an illegal immigrant at his home," 
says a Feinstein radio spot. ". . . And what else don't we Californians know 
about Michael Huffington?" 
</P>
<P>
 The advertising attack got under way as the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service and the Internal Revenue Service indicated that they will look into 
possible violations of the law based on Huffington's statement that he employed 
a nanny illegally and did not pay all required taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 IRS spokesman Keith Kimball said he could not discuss any specific case but 
added, "When there is a public admission, it's not something we're going to 
ignore." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, campaigning in Santa Barbara late Friday, seemed to compound his 
problems by admitting that his household might have employed more than one 
illegal immigrant, although he said he was not certain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am saying I don't know," Huffington told reporters. "But if there were, my 
wife, remember, was in charge. I take responsibility, though, for anything. 
That's the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
 Recent polls have shown Huffington and Feinstein in a close race in the Senate 
contest, which has set spending records and been dominated by negative 
television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, the Feinstein campaign highlighted what it contended was 
Huffington's hypocrisy, at one point noting that he co-sponsored an 
unsuccessful bill last year that would have made it a crime punishable by five 
years in prison to transport an illegal immigrant across state lines. The Times 
has reported that the Huffingtons took their illegal nanny to Washington after 
he was elected to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the bill during an appearance at a GOP campaign office in Santa 
Barbara, Huffington drew a blank. "What legislation did I propose?" he asked. 
Reminded of the details, he asked, "It hasn't passed, has it?" 
</P>
<P>
 During the same exchange with reporters, the candidate was asked whether he 
had employed the nanny's husband, who also was in the country illegally. After 
saying he did not know, Huffington added: 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is I take responsibility, that's the bottom line," he said, 
repeating the phrase several times.  
</P>
<P>
 "For what?" a reporter finally interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 "For anything that my wife may have done that has to do with illegal 
immigrants. I take full responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . You take responsibility because you knew it was going on?" another 
reporter asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, because I am the husband," Huffington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward, the candidate's wife, Arianna Huffington, said the nanny's 
husband was never an employee but did run errands for the household. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nobody else," she said. "Marisela's (the nanny's) husband sometimes 
would go buy things from Vons. But he was never on payroll. He always had 
another full-time job," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a campaign appearance in San Francisco, Feinstein told reporters it was 
hard for her to tell whether the illegal nanny issue would affect the race, but 
she noted that other public figures, such as attorney general nominee Zoe 
Baird, have been rejected because of similar actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people feel very strongly about this and even more, it's a violation 
of federal law," the senator said. "If employer sanctions are going to work, 
then people have to understand that and follow them." 
</P>
<P>
 Her campaign began running new ads that pick up on the theme that Huffington 
is a candidate who cannot be trusted. Noting Huffington's admission that he did 
pay not all the required taxes for the nanny, the radio commercial says, "We 
don't even know whether Congressman Huffington has paid any California income 
taxes at all. Why not? Because he won't show us his tax returns. Huffington 
hires illegal immigrants -- illegally. And Huffington refuses to disclose his 
tax returns." 
</P>
<P>
 Both the television and radio spots cite a story in The Times on Thursday 
reporting that the Huffingtons hired the illegal nanny to look after their 
children for more than four years, ending in August, 1993, more than six months 
after Huffington was sworn into Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "On illegal immigration, can we Californians trust Congressman Huffington?" 
both ads say. "Can we believe him?" 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the Feinstein ads, Huffington campaign spokeswoman Jennifer 
Grossman said, "I think that again and again rather than taking on the real 
immigration issue and the real tax issue, namely her compulsive vote for higher 
taxes, she continually returns to the personal in an attempt to distract 
attention from her pathetic record." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the Labor Department released 62 pages of documents under the 
Freedom of Information Act showing how Arianna Huffington, the candidate's 
wife, attempted to win legal status for the nanny in 1990 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Huffington's name does not appear in the application for legal status, 
and in one document Arianna Huffington identifies herself as the "head of 
household." 
</P>
<P>
 The documents appear to show that the Huffingtons followed the normal 
procedure of interviewing U.S. citizens for the nanny position before receiving 
certification that their illegal nanny was the only one who could do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Going through the state Employment Development Department as required, Arianna 
Huffington reviewed four job applicants and found them all wanting. 
</P>
<P>
 Receiving certification that the immigrant was the only one who could do the 
job was the first step in obtaining a visa allowing the nanny to work in this 
country. But after obtaining the certification, the application for work papers 
was never filed. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Labor Department, the Huffingtons' nanny was one of 398 
"child monitors" to receive certification out of 455 applications in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Dave Lesher and Patrick J. McDonnell in Los Angeles and 
Times researcher Norma Kaufman in San Francisco contributed to this story.

HUFFINGTON PLAN TO REMAKE HOUSTON SKYLINE FELL FLAT; BUSINESS: HE SECRETLY 
BOUGHT UP 11 DOWNTOWN BLOCKS FOR PROJECT. BUT COLLAPSE OF OIL MARKET TOOK DREAM 
WITH IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This was Mike Huffington's "baby," the chance to leave his own mark on a city 
that had long revered his oil-rich father as an entrepreneurial genius. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's vision for his hometown: To create an urban community of swank 
high-rise condominiums, theaters and restaurants out of a tired downtown 
neighborhood. Working in secret, he bought up properties piece by piece through 
the 1980s and amassed 11 city blocks, utilizing the family oil money that is 
now financing his campaign for the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Like his headlong rush into politics, it was a move so aggressive for the 
conservative businessman that even close associates were left shaking their 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the Texas oil market collapsed, taking with it any hopes for 
Huffington's dream development. And the property -- now dotted with boarded-up 
shops, overgrown fields, and lots crammed with rusted-out trucks -- sits 
instead as a remnant of his lucrative yet erratic two decades in business. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Boyd, vice president of the company that bought out Huffington's 
family-owned operation in 1990 for a reported $600 million, laughs when asked 
what his firm hopes to do with the once-promising land acquired in the deal. 
"We'd like to sell it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stalled development, representing one of the biggest land deals in Houston 
history, underscores central questions in the Republican congressman's bid to 
defeat Sen. Dianne Feinstein on Nov. 8: Just how good was Mike Huffington as a 
businessman? And what does his record as an oil company executive and 
entrepreneur say about his ability to help lead California through tough 
economic times? 
</P>
<P>
 For the 47-year-old Huffington, the link between profit margins and prudent 
public policy is inextricable. His main achievement as an oil executive and his 
primary mission as a U.S. senator, he said in an interview, are essentially 
one: "Trying to cut back the fat in the budget." 
</P>
<P>
 With a brief political record to run on, Huffington has made his business 
career a cornerstone of his Senate campaign, holding himself up as a man who 
built a fortune from modest beginnings before moving to Santa Barbara less than 
four years ago. "I am the American Dream," he declared as he unseated a 
longtime incumbent congressman in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In the powerful oil and banking cliques of Texas, Huffington still carries a 
reputation as a tough, in-your-face negotiator who brought his Harvard Business 
School organizational savvy to a family company that was rich in gas reserves 
but raw in modern business know-how. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is also remembered as a businessman who served largely as a 
high-ranking "caretaker" for his father's corporate empire and was often absent 
when trouble hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult to find specific things that Mike achieved. He didn't 
have any real track record," said John T. Brown III, a former vice president at 
Huffco, the oil conglomerate that Huffington's wildcatter father founded. 
"Mike's idea of managing the company was to preserve the family wealth. He did 
not take risks." 
</P>
<P>
 Many other associates describe Huffington as an industrious, hands-on 
executive. He even involved himself in corporate minutia, insisting that his 
140 employees keep their desks clean and avoid smoking and caffeine in the 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was his company," said Boyd, who worked as Huffco's controller. 
</P>
<P>
 Even his supporters, however, are slow to point to business successes that 
presaged Huffington's political career. Although he oversaw Huffco finances as 
chief financial officer, problems arose on several fronts: 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental: The company paid about $1 million in the mid-1980s to clean up 
coastal wetlands on the Gulf Coast that were damaged by its oil rigs, according 
to former general counsel John Patton. Huffington and other officials 
voluntarily paid even more to clean up decades-old oil contamination discovered 
at a 400-acre site that Huffco owned just outside Houston, former executives 
said. Federal records show the firm also is listed as a "potentially 
responsible party" at a polluted Superfund site in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, a Huffco subsidiary owned a 20% stake in a bankrupted Paramount 
refinery that left a trail of environmental damage, The Times reported earlier 
this month. Testing has found that hazardous pollutants have spread into ground 
water and soil surrounding the 60-acre site, and water quality officials say it 
may cost tens of millions of dollars to clean up. Officials said that the 
pollution probably started decades before the Huffington company held an 
interest for several years in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal: The U.S. Commerce Department fined Huffco $250,000 in 1986 because it 
had improperly made dozens of shipments of computers and police equipment -- 
including shock batons, billy clubs and handcuffs -- to Indonesia. The company 
ran one of the world's largest liquefied gas operations there, and former 
executives say the items were shipped, without required U.S. authorization, for 
use by Huffco's overseas employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said he took immediate steps to avoid a recurrence, but the export 
violations already had proved costly to his political aspirations. He said the 
investigation had prompted him to ask the Ronald Reagan Administration to 
quietly withdraw his nomination as an assistant Commerce secretary before the 
Senate could consider it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know how Washington is -- if you have something (potentially damaging) 
like that," he said, "it's just not worth going through it." 
</P>
<P>
 Financial: The company suffered major losses during his tenure on two oil 
projects in California and Oklahoma. The $135-million California project, 
designed to process crude oil in Bakersfield and pipe it to Los Angeles, led to 
tens of millions of dollars in losses and prompted run-ins with Texas bankers 
and Sacramento tax officials over millions more in alleged unpaid debts. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Huffington dismissed many of these difficulties as 
insignificant compared to his biggest achievement -- persuading his family to 
sell Huffco in 1990 at what he considers its peak value. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the problems, he said, were someone else's doing. 
</P>
<P>
 The baton and computer shipments, Huffington said, were authorized by 
lower-level executives without his knowledge and he was furious when he found 
out.  
</P>
<P>
 The Paramount refinery was run with little involvement from him, and he knew 
nothing about its environmental problems, said Huffington, whose account was 
supported by others. 
</P>
<P>
 The first he heard of Huffco's $1-million oil cleanup on the Gulf Coast or the 
firm's connection to the Superfund site in Louisiana came when a Times reporter 
asked about those issues in a recent interview, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 And he and other former Huffco officials said the Bakersfield refinery was 
approved by his father despite Huffington's warnings that it could be a big 
money-loser. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're asking the wrong guy," he added. "That was done by other people. It 
was not one that I played an active role in at all. . . . It was not my 
favorite project." 
</P>
<P>
 After Huffco was unable to repay part of a $15-million loan from First City 
National Bank of Houston, bank executive Bob Wagner negotiated with Huffington 
to settle the matter.  
</P>
<P>
 "The positive side to him was that he had a much more organized management 
style than his father, and he had good people around him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The negative was that he got (Huffco) into some lousy investments . . . and 
he was a tough guy to get along with," he said. "His attitude was, 'This is our 
offer, guys. If you don't like it, take a hike.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The bank, which later failed, wrote off more than $5 million in losses on the 
loan, federal records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's supporters say the congressman, only now managing to escape his 
father's shadow, is rarely given credit for helping build Huffco and for using 
conservative fiscal policies to protect it from the oil bust of the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way (Huffington) approached the business could very well have saved the 
company from going off a cliff," said Michael Decker, Huffo's former chief 
financial officer. "Huffco was the best-run, best-financed, best-performing 
independent oil company. The (profit) margins were great. This was a home-run 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington refused to provide records to corroborate such claims. "You have to 
take people's word for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's business dealings did make him a rich man. He and his wife, 
author Arianna Huffington, own multimillion-dollar homes on each coast, and he 
is thought to be worth more than $70 million, his share of Huffco's 1990 buyout 
by a nationalized Taiwanese oil company. 
</P>
<P>
 The congressman is so well-off that he has been donating his federal salary to 
children's causes in Santa Barbara -- and he has spent more than $25 million of 
his own money on the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet less is known about his finances than those of many other major candidates 
because Huffington has refused repeated calls from rivals and the media to 
release annual tax returns and other financial documents. He says voters are 
most interested in state and national issues, not his wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 Some who have worked closely with Huffington find it incongruous that such a 
zealously private person has thrust himself into what has become one of the 
nation's most publicized races. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never saw Mike as a politician," said Patton, the Huffco general counsel. 
"He was a very private person, and politics just isn't a game for private 
people, in my view." 
</P>
<P>
 As a candidate, he has carefully chosen what to disclose about his career. His 
campaign provided a reporter with a list of 29 professional associates who 
could speak about his accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 All who were interviewed spoke well of Huffington but most said they had 
rarely, if ever, dealt directly with him. They said they knew him primarily 
through his father, Roy, a geologist who forged into oil exploration in the 
1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 The response of San Antonio oilman Robert V. West Jr. was typical: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a good friend really of Roy, and I know Mike through Roy," said West, a 
retired petroleum company founder. "I think and hope that he's like his father, 
really a great American. If he turns out half as good as Roy, he'll be doing 
pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has clung to his privacy, even when it comes to investments that he 
has had to publicly disclose. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he reported in a congressional conflict-of-interest statement 
that his ownership in a Southern California production company called Crest 
Films Ltd. was worth $500,000 to $1 million. But Crest President Pierre de 
Lespinois said Huffington paid "definitely . . . more than $1 million" for his 
half-interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington declined to discuss the discrepancy, saying: "That's private, it's 
a private company." 
</P>
<P>
 Born of middle-class roots in Dallas in 1947, Huffington says he has 
restlessly considered a wide range of professions over the years -- from real 
estate and filmmaking to religion, teaching and, in what he now considers his 
true spiritual calling, politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all the possibilities, however, oil has dominated his professional life. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Harvard Business School in 1972, Huffington went out on 
his own for four years in banking and oil investment. But after a messy legal 
run-in with his partners in a Texas investment firm, he joined the family 
company in 1976 to work in finance. 
</P>
<P>
 He stayed there for virtually all of the next 14 years in high-ranking 
positions under his father. He took only a year's break to work as a deputy 
assistant secretary of defense in arms control, a position secured in part 
through his family's contributions to the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiscal prudence has been Huffington's professional credo, and even his 
personal portfolio today is built around low-risk holdings, with millions held 
in U.S. Treasury bills, state bonds, IRAs and money market accounts, records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 His conservative philosophies became well-entrenched in Houston: 
</P>
<P>
 Although it put him at odds with his Huffco associates, Huffington opposed the 
ill-fated Bakersfield refinery because he thought it was too risky. 
</P>
<P>
 His penchant for husbanding the company's resources became the stuff of legend 
in the office. On the eve of Huffco's sale to the Taiwanese, several colleagues 
recalled, he gathered up desk supplies before the buyers moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 And his corporate billings sparked recurring tensions with Huffco's overseas 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971, Huffington's father tapped into a major natural gas reserve in the 
jungles of Indonesia, and the family struck it rich over the next two decades 
as a partner with the Indonesian government and other international players in 
a gas liquefaction operation that generated tens of millions of dollars a year 
in sales to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 From their Houston office, Huffco executives oversaw the Indonesia project and 
agreed to bill the partners for their administrative work. It was a profitable 
but contentious arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike wasn't bashful about spending money on his own personal (business) 
travel -- first class and all that. As a general rule, that was all billed to 
the (Indonesia) partnership," said Paul T. Scott, former executive vice 
president at Huffco. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike liked corporate jets and he had a corporate jet, so he used it (and 
billed some of the expenses). Those were the perks of the job, and there was 
some resentment from the partners." 
</P>
<P>
 One former Huffco official who spoke on condition of anonymity remembered an 
upset Huffington demanding to know why more of the official's time that month 
had (not) been billed to the Indonesia project. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington declined to discuss the billings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Huffco's Indonesian venture occupied much of his time, Huffington 
said, oil never generated the passion for him that it did for his father. His 
greater interest was in real estate, he said, and his Houston land acquisition 
was seen as his brainchild. 
</P>
<P>
 Over a period that spanned a decade, beginning in 1979, Huffington directed a 
handful of associates to gradually buy up what amounted to 11 blocks of a 
run-down area now dominated by the George R. Brown Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington hoped the city's runaway growth would spill into the area, and 
Huffco would supply land for prime development. But even many of those closest 
to Huffington knew nothing about his plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston real estate broker David L. Cook, who helped buy the land piece by 
piece, remembers the intense secrecy among intermediaries handling the deal -- 
including code names for parcels, pseudonyms for agents, even disguised voices 
for phone conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly we didn't want all the landowners to know who the purchasers were, 
or even that there was one purchaser out there," he said. "It would raise the 
price." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Huffco executive Decker, who would serve as best man at Huffington's 
wedding, says he never heard anything about the project until several years 
after it began. Huffington sat him down one day on a bench downtown and 
instructed him to take a look at the neighborhood of parking lots, small shops 
and vacant land. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of this," Huffington told him, "is ours." 
</P>
<P>
 In launching the land deal, Decker recalled, "his vision was to really have an 
impact on the skyline of the city and to do something that would be a lasting 
achievement in its history, a visible achievement." 
</P>
<P>
 These are the types of images that Huffington often summons in speaking of his 
political ambitions as well. But in the Houston deal, the achievement never 
came. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom dropped out of the oil market, and with it went much of Houston's 
growth. So by the time the family began shopping its vast oil-and-gas 
operations to bidders in the late 1980s, it was also willing to sell off the 
land Huffington had worked so long to acquire. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only mistake they made," said Houston realty agent Jenard Gross, a close 
friend and political backer of Huffington, "was that they were a little late in 
the game. And of course, the oil collapse occurred so they just ended up with a 
lot of land they didn't develop." 
</P>
<P>
 The mistake may have proved costly. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Huffington would not discuss the land's finances, associates say they 
believe Huffco took a substantial loss, and financial and court records appear 
to bear them out. The family company paid a reported $38 million for the land, 
but the Taiwanese buyers valued it at only $15 million in a purchase agreement 
with Huffco. 
</P>
<P>
 Even today, Huffington considers the land "a fantastic investment" that may 
yet attract a developer. He speaks in terms of sacrifice when discussing the 
decision to package the property with Huffco's oil assets in the 1990 sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father, if he was willing to sell the oil business, which he loved, then I 
had to be willing to sell the real estate business," he said. The downtown 
property "was my baby, but so it was for my father when he sold his company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was the right thing to do." Huffington's Business Career 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some key events in the professional life of Republican Senate 
candidate Mike Huffington: 
</P>
<P>
 * 1974: Two years out of Harvard Business School, Huffington starts oil 
investment firm in Houston with two partners. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1976: After messy run-in with partners, Huffington leaves investment firm 
with $700,000 buyout and joins Huffco, the Houston oil company his father 
founded. Serves in high-level finance positions over 14 years, becoming vice 
chairman under his father. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1979: Huffington begins decade-long task of quietly buying up 11 blocks of 
downtown Houston land for the family firm. Oil bust later stalls hopes for 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1980: Huffington arranges financing for $135-million refinery project in 
Bakersfield. Company suffers tens of millions of dollars in losses, and 
refinery is later folded into partnership with a Paramount refinery that has 
experienced widespread environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1984: President Ronald Reagan nominates Huffington as an assistant commerce 
secretary but quietly drops nomination several months later. It is later 
disclosed that a Commerce Department investigation, leading to a $250,000 fine 
against Huffco in 1986 for unauthorized shipments of computer and police 
equipment to Indonesia, caused Huffington to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1986: Huffington lands lower-level job as deputy assistant secretary of 
defense, working in arms control. Unlike commerce position, it does not require 
Senate confirmation. Huffington stays about a year before returning to Huffco. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1990: At Huffington's urging, family completes sale of Huffco to 
nationalized Taiwanese oil company for reported $600 million. Huffington gets 
$70-million share. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1992: After moving to the Santa Barbara area with his wife and two 
daughters, Huffington spends $5.2 million to upset incumbent Robert J. 
Lagomarsino for a seat in Congress. 
</P>
<P>

PRESIDENT DELIVERS CHEERING WORDS TO TROOPS IN KUWAIT; MIDEAST: JOINING THE GIS 
AT THEIR DESERT OUTPOST, CLINTON GIVES THEM MORE PAY AND INDICATES THEY'LL BE 
HOME FOR CHRISTMAS. HE HEADS BACK AFTER SAUDI STOP.

<P>
 President Clinton won cheers from American troops in Kuwait in the 
time-honored fashion Friday: by increasing their pay and suggesting strongly 
that they would be home for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Clinton's speech -- a recitation of the importance of their mission 
and of U.S. attempts to contain Iraq -- drew polite applause from the several 
hundred American troops gathered along with British, Kuwaiti and other Arab 
soldiers to hear his remarks amid a made-for-pictures assemblage of military 
hardware in the dust of the Kuwaiti desert. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Clinton finished speaking, soldiers calling "When do we go home?" 
drew him back to the podium. Smiling, he looked out at the crowd and said, 
"Don't forget to go Christmas shopping," drawing loud and raucous cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 Military officials, including Secretary of Defense William J. Perry, had 
already said that most, perhaps all, of the U.S. combat troops recently sent to 
the Persian Gulf will be home for the holidays, assuming that Iraq refrains 
from any hostile moves in the meantime, although new units may be sent to 
replace those now here. 
</P>
<P>
 That word, however, had not yet filtered down to the ranks, and virtually all 
the troops interviewed by reporters before Clinton talked said the one thing 
above all that they wanted to hear was news on when they would be leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 Several also mentioned a festering pay dispute involving subsistence 
allowances for enlisted personnel, and Clinton drew a loud ovation by 
announcing that he had signed an executive order that will mean about $300 per 
month extra for enlisted personnel deployed on combat missions such as this 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's speech to the troops at a tactical base northeast of Kuwait City and 
about 50 miles from the Iraqi border was the final public event of a Mideast 
tour that has brought the President through six countries in four days. 
</P>
<P>
 After brief visits with the Emir of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, the 
President headed for home and is expected to return to Washington early this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Army officials, eager to create the proper setting for the presidential visit 
to the troops, erected a desert base worthy of a Hollywood sound stage -- 
complete with triumphal arch about 30 feet high and made from a portable 
armored bridge, a stage built on the backs of two M-1 tanks and a lectern 
draped with camouflage netting. On a small rise just behind Clinton as he spoke 
-- framing his head in television pictures -- were another M-1 tank and a 
Bradley fighting vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials did their part too, positioning some of the Arab troops 
near the President -- within the line of the TV cameras -- in an effort to 
guarantee the right image of allied cooperation in the effort against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 The troops, meanwhile, like soldiers everywhere deployed far from home, seemed 
happy to have a visitor, although for many, Clinton seemed a lesser source of 
excitement than CBS news anchor Connie Chung, who autographed helmets and 
regimental colors for the troops while awaiting the President's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the eagerness to go home, morale seemed high among the troops who have 
been deployed for about three weeks in the constant grit, ever-present flies 
and arid heat that make the Kuwaiti desert among the most unpleasant places in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Many seemed to make light of the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got sand in California too," said Pvt. Edward Horcasitas, 21, of 
Hawthorne, an infantryman normally based at Ft. Stewart, Ga. Still, he joined 
the near-universal sentiment in favor of a quick exit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping he says we're going to go home real soon," Horcasitas said of 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming out to the desert "shows he cares," Horcasitas added. "At least 
somebody knows we're down here. We don't see much about this place on the news 
now. We figure people kind of forgot about us." 
</P>
<P>
 The other topic on the minds of the troops appeared to be the pay dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Under military regulations, troops deployed abroad to potential combat areas 
lose the money they would otherwise receive as a subsistence allowance -- about 
$200 per month -- on the theory that they do not need the extra pay while in 
the field because the military is paying for their food and shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds, however, can amount to 13% of the pay for a low-rank soldier, and 
many families depend on the money. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, troops had complained that the rule was unfair because under the 
same regulations, troops deployed on peacekeeping or humanitarian missions, as 
opposed to combat, get to keep the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The new executive order changes the rules to allow the extra pay to continue 
as well as some smaller additional allowances, bringing the total to about 
$300. 
</P>
<P>
 While in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, Clinton and his aides discussed efforts to 
increase the amount of military hardware that the United States leaves 
pre-positioned in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the trip began, the Administration succeeded in winning permission from 
Kuwait and some of its Arab neighbors to strengthen its military presence in 
the region in an effort to speed up its response to any future threat from 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 After weeks of negotiations, Washington announced on Wednesday that it had 
secured permission from Kuwait to station a squadron of 24 Air Force A-10 
Warthog antitank warplanes there permanently, starting at the end of this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon also announced that Qatar had agreed to store enough tanks and 
armored vehicles on its territory to equip a brigade of U.S. soldiers, about 
5,500 troops. Last week, Kuwait said it will double its own storage facilities 
to house a full brigade's armor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has also been negotiating with the nearby United Arab 
Emirates to accept enough armor to equip a third brigade -- a move that would 
enable the United States to house enough weaponry for a full division near the 
Kuwait-Iraq border.

PROP. 187 KEY TO GETTING U.S. AID, WILSON ARGUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL and AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson said Friday that the only way California can get the federal 
government to pay for services to illegal immigrants living in the state is to 
pass Proposition 187 on the Nov. 8 ballot because "that's what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
 The comment came as Wilson, who has inextricably linked his campaign for 
reelection to the controversial ballot initiative, sharply accused the Clinton 
Administration of playing politics with the issue. He specifically named Atty. 
Gen. Janet Reno and said he had never seen a national Administration "so 
flagrantly politicize the Department of Justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Once again Friday, illegal immigration dominated the debate in the governor's 
race. But as recent poll numbers have shown declining -- though still strong -- 
support for Proposition 187 among California voters, Wilson and Democratic 
challenger Kathleen Brown have shifted the emphasis of their remarks on the 
measure, which would deny education and health benefits to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has moved much more aggressively to attack Wilson on Proposition 187 and 
again proposed Friday that she and Wilson meet a second time in face-to-face 
debate -- with illegal immigration the only question. She proposed the debate, 
quickly rejected by Wilson, for Tuesday night, one week before Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, meanwhile, has been refining his rhetoric on Proposition 187 to focus 
increasingly on using the measure as a tool to get the federal government to 
pay for the state's costs for benefits to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 By framing the issue around who pays for the services, rather than about 
services being denied, the Republican governor avoided saying Friday that 
Proposition 187 includes nothing about who should pay for any services provided 
to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 says simply that illegal immigrants are not eligible for any 
public services except emergency health care and it establishes mechanisms for 
state employees and school workers to report those suspected of being illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the measure passes and is upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, which 
Wilson has predicted would occur, there is no mechanism either in the 
initiative or at the court's disposal to force the President and Congress to 
appropriate money to California. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Schnur, the Wilson campaign spokesman, acknowledged that that is the case. 
However, he said the political momentum of a successful ballot measure would 
pressure Washington to compensate the state for services to illegal immigrants, 
which Wilson puts at more than $3 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though his comments Friday focused on making the federal government pay 
for services, the Wilson campaign continues to air television commercials that 
show grainy black-and-white images of people presumably running across the 
border ahead of patrol agents. "They keep coming," the announcer droned during 
an earlier ad. 
</P>
<P>
 After Brown proposed another debate Friday, Schnur rejected the proposal, 
saying, "Pete Wilson already debated Kathleen Brown on the subject of illegal 
immigration and Pete Wilson won." 
</P>
<P>
 When Brown was told about Wilson's comments on the Clinton Administration 
politicizing the issue, she retorted: "(Wilson) in fact has cynically 
manipulated the issue of Proposition 187, trying to fool the voters of 
California about what it means to each and every man, woman and child in the 
state." 
</P>
<P>
 Reno has opposed Proposition 187 and the Justice Department issued an 
unofficial opinion Thursday that raised doubts about its constitutionality, 
noting that it was very similar to a Texas law that was struck down in 1982 on 
a 5-4 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said Friday, "Atty. Gen. Reno, I think, has been guilty of politics 
from Day 1 on this issue. This Administration has sought to interject itself in 
a state issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 has become a polarizing lightning rod in the governor's race. 
Along with crime, Wilson has made it the key issue in his race. For months, 
political experts expected it to pass overwhelmingly. Meanwhile, Brown was 
talking mostly about a modest and relatively conservative economics program and 
trying to appear to be as tough as Wilson on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three weeks, as voters focused more keenly on ballot issues, 
Proposition 187's standing in the polls slipped significantly and Brown, 
sensing a strong tide surging to the "no" side, has hitched her campaign to it. 
She always opposed Proposition 187, but usually said little or nothing on it 
unless asked for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Two items have caused Wilson political difficulty recently: the notion of 
barring children from school and the specter of some sort of national identity 
card that might have to be carried by every legal resident of the United States 
to get into school, or to qualify for free state social services. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has always indicated that he does not believe children ever would be 
kicked out of school because of the measure. But he said Friday that changes in 
the Supreme Court since the 1982 Texas decision make him believe the court 
would uphold Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 As the poll standing of Proposition 187 dropped, Brown stepped up the attack 
on the ID card issue, charging that Wilson supported such a card that would 
lead to "Big Brother" government. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview early this week, Wilson seemed to indicate that all legal 
residents of the United States would have to "carry" an identification card 
testifying to their citizenship or legal residence. But he said Thursday that 
he did not hear the word carry in the reporter's question, and did not intend 
to give the impression everyone would have to carry their cards all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said the cards would have to be carried only on rare occasions such as 
applying for a job or entering a new school for the first time. On Friday, 
Wilson insisted again that it would not be a national identity card. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he first wrote a detailed letter in August, 1993, to President 
Clinton demanding federal reimbursement for the state's cost of services to 
illegal immigrants, he proposed "creation of a tamper-proof, legal resident 
eligibility card that would be required as proof of eligibility for all legal 
residents seeking benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson this week said the card was simply a more sophisticated version of 
existing documentation that now is required by immigration officials of 
employers whenever they hire a new worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown commented, at a news conference held on Sunset Boulevard: "After two 
days of backpedaling and clarifying, I still can't figure out whether he 
supports a national ID card or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is he philosophically opposed to a national ID card or does he support one? 
Or does he just not want us to carry one? Or does he want to have one just some 
of the time? We need to get clarification on this issue," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown's position has been confusing as well. She has proposed that a new 
tamper-proof Social Security card be issued by the federal government that 
would serve as proof of citizenship or legal residence. She has said it would 
avoid the "billions" of dollars Wilson's card system would cost. And while 
everyone would have one, she said as well that that is not a national 
identification card. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has argued that the two best ways to control illegal immigration are to 
tighten up the border between the United States and Mexico and to more strictly 
enforce the law that prohibits employers from hiring illegal immigrants. Jobs 
are the main attraction for illegal immigrants, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has said repeatedly that illegal immigrants are coming for the social 
services, including public schooling and the opportunity to have their children 
born in the United States and automatically become U.S. citizens. Wilson has 
proposed also that the Constitution be amended so that those children no longer 
would automatically qualify for citizenship.

COLUMN ONE; HIRED GUNS TURN TIDE IN ANGOLA; A MOTLEY CREW OF MERCENARIES AND 
COMBAT VETERANS FROM AFRICA'S BATTLES HAS HELPED PUT TENACIOUS UNITA REBELS ON 
THE ROPES IN A BITTER CIVIL WAR. ONE RESULT COULD BE A NEW PEACE ACCORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trim and tan, polished and polite, former South African secret agent and 
commando Eeben Barlow is the very model of a modern mercenary. 
</P>
<P>
 At 38, he heads Executive Outcomes, a multimillion-dollar corporation that 
employs 500 or so fellow soldiers of fortune, including a motley crew of former 
assassins, spies, saboteurs and scoundrels. They hail from half a dozen nations 
and are veterans of combat around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Most fought in losing battles to save colonial reigns and racist regimes in 
countries such as Congo, Kenya, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and especially South 
Africa. Many worked for apartheid's most sinister security forces. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is no ordinary band of rogues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are dynamic, professional and work to achieve success," Barlow explained 
at his bush headquarters here, a former Cuban air base. "We are profit-driven, 
and our profit depends on the satisfaction of the client." 
</P>
<P>
 The company logo -- emblazoned on calling cards, not to mention tie tacks and 
cuff links -- is a paladin, the same chess knight featured on the old TV series 
"Have Gun, Will Travel." 
</P>
<P>
 These hired guns have traveled to what the United Nations has called the 
world's deadliest war. Now, under their second $20-million contract from the 
Angolan government, Barlow's men have spent 14 months helping to train a ragtag 
army of conscripts, and they plan and coordinate fighting in key battles. 
</P>
<P>
 Even their critics concede that the self-described "military consultants" have 
helped the long-beleaguered government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos 
gain territory and a decided advantage in the long, bitter war against Jonas 
Savimbi's rebel UNITA movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Other factors were also critical. Independent analysts say UNITA has been hard 
pressed by an international arms and oil embargo and the loss of lucrative 
diamond-producing areas, which paid for the war effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that the rebels are increasingly on the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt FAA (Forcas Armadas de Angolanas, the government army) has 
the upper hand now," said Yvon Madore, a senior U.N. official in Luanda, the 
refugee-clogged capital. "UNITA has lost momentum." 
</P>
<P>
 That explains why the government and UNITA may sign a U.N.-brokered peace pact 
next month after almost a year of stormy talks in neighboring Zambia. It calls 
for demobilization of combatants, U.N. peacekeeping troops and ultimately a 
government based on power-sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 But many doubt that the "Lusaka Accord" will bring lasting peace -- or even a 
cease-fire -- in a 19-year-old war that the world has largely forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 UNITA, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, now controls 
about a third of the countryside, less than half what it held a year ago. It 
has signed peace pacts before but used the time to resupply and regroup forces. 
In 1992, Savimbi even ran in U.N.-supervised elections. When he lost, he cried 
fraud and resumed the war with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the first time, the Dos Santos government is in a position of 
strength. It has international legitimacy from winning democratic elections, 
plus an estimated $2 billion in new arms and equipment. The air force, now able 
to bomb at night, controls the skies. Morale has improved. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, government hard-liners insist that Savimbi can now be beaten, or 
at least pushed back to the bush. They want to force UNITA from 
diamond-producing areas and cut its supply lines to Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy fighting along the border last week after months of calm suggests that 
the hawks are getting their way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should the government share power if they can beat them militarily?" 
asked Mike McDonagh, country director for the Irish aid group Concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Government troops are entrenched about 30 miles outside of Savimbi's last 
urban stronghold, the central highlands city of Huambo, and slowly closing in 
from three sides. Losing Huambo would be a decisive defeat for UNITA, which 
captured the battered city last year after a fierce 55-day siege. 
</P>
<P>
 As always, civilians have borne the brunt. The United Nations estimated last 
year that up to 1,000 Angolans were dying each day of war-related wounds, 
hunger and disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Aid officials say the toll probably has not fallen much. They say one-third of 
the population of 11 million is directly affected by the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, aid groups and the United Nations were unable to fly badly 
needed food and medicine to most major cities because of fighting or other 
problems. Kuito, where an estimated 25,000 people died last year, was 
especially hard hit. Relief flights, stopped since May, resumed only in 
mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem now is a lot of bodies are buried in people's gardens," said 
Sarah Longford, spokeswoman for the U.N. Humanitarian Assistance Coordination 
Unit in Luanda. "When the rains come, there will be a real health risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Angola is potentially one of Africa's wealthiest countries. It is a fertile 
land rich with oil and diamonds. But millions of land mines still in the soil 
will ensure heavy casualties for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Barlow planted at least some of those mines. Trained as a combat engineer, he 
rose through the ranks of the "32 Battalion," an infamous force of black troops 
led by white South African commandos deployed in Angola in the 1980s. Many of 
Barlow's current colleagues fought under him then, although he insists that 
none were involved in the battalion's reported atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is they fought on behalf of UNITA -- the group that is now their 
enemy. Barlow speaks poorly of his former comrades in arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could never understand why we had an ally like UNITA," he said. "They 
stole our equipment. . . . And they wouldn't fight." 
</P>
<P>
 But UNITA was anti-Communist and heavily backed by Washington, as well as 
Pretoria. On the other side, Cuba sent 50,000 troops and the Soviet Union 
shipped supplies to prop up the then-Marxist Angolan government in Luanda. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cold War ended, but unfortunately, the proxy war did not. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, Barlow said, he joined South Africa's Directorate of Covert 
Collection, one of the apartheid regime's most infamous security units. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was responsible for espionage operations against so-called 'front-line' 
states," the black-ruled countries around South Africa that led the campaign 
against apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 After six years, he said, he moved to the Civil Cooperation Bureau. Run by the 
military, the innocent-sounding group ran death squads against political foes. 
Barlow said only that he headed a five-man cell that set up front companies in 
Cyprus and seven other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when he formed Executive Outcomes in Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the Civil Cooperation Bureau closed in 1991, he began selling 
"specialist security services" across Africa, offering everything from 
espionage to encryption. Angola's oil company hired them to protect its huge 
coastal facility at the town of Soyo. And that, in turn, led to a unique offer 
last year to restructure and retrain Angola's military. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's military commander, former South African Lt. Col. Nick van der 
Bergh, promoted himself to brigadier. Applications came from as far away as 
Germany and Australia, drawn in part by monthly salaries ranging from $2,500 to 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cited service with legendary Irish mercenary Michael (Mad Mike) Hoare, 
who once tried to take over the Seychelles. A helicopter pilot who listed his 
work as "shooting Tamils out of trees" in Sri Lanka. A father who enlisted with 
his son and boasted he'd never lost a war. "I always killed someone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Executive Outcomes works from three major bases in Angola. The largest 
and closest to the front is at Saurimo, a provincial capital now surrounded by 
UNITA forces. Most of the company's 15 killed or captured employees in Angola 
were working there. 
</P>
<P>
 Flying the firm's chartered Boeing 727 into Saurimo last week, the pilot opted 
for caution. "We'll fly a left spiral down," he announced cheerfully. "Nothing 
to be alarmed about. Just a precaution against SAMs, Stingers and other 
heat-seeking missiles. . . . Hope you enjoy the flight." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, he cut power to the engines and the jet dropped from the sky, 
cork-screwing from 17,500 feet at a gut-wrenching angle to a runway lined with 
shot-up planes and bombed-out buildings. No missiles were fired. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's other major training area is at Longa, 125 miles south of 
Luanda, along a crocodile-infested river inside a national park. Monkeys 
scamper in branches overhead, scorpions race over the dirt, and malaria is 
endemic. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 trainers live in tents there, and on a recent muggy morning they 
reviewed several hundred fresh Angolan conscripts. Most of the new troops wore 
only rags, some were barefoot; they drilled with sticks for weapons. They will 
be issued guns and uniforms after several months of training. 
</P>
<P>
 Out on a dusty field, however, Wynand du Toit had organized a display by newly 
trained Angolan special forces. It was not a good day. They failed twice to 
detonate a string of explosives that Du Toit had explained was "good for 
destroying a car park." An instructor finally set the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, a 10-man squad spoiled a mock assault when they fired their AK-47s and 
rocket-propelled grenades into the ground as they ran, rather than at a target. 
But the final exercise went off without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Du Toit, 36, is perhaps South Africa's best-known soldier. He spent 2 1/2 
years in a Luanda military jail after he was captured trying to destroy an 
Angolan oil facility in 1985. Shot in the neck, he almost died in prison and 
came home a war hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Burly and bearded, he said it felt "funny" to return to Angola to work for 
those who almost killed him. But he insisted that he has no regrets: "I feel 
liberated. I don't work for any political party. I don't work for any 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the problem, say critics in South Africa's new government. Rusty Evans, 
director general of the Department of Foreign Affairs, has condemned Executive 
Outcomes as mercenaries and a "dangerous, criminal and destructive force in 
Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, Barlow said. "We are a stabilizing force and we have broken no laws." 
And he hates being called a mercenary. His men don't fight, loot or maraud, he 
insisted. "We are military advisers." 
</P>
<P>
 But that may be a matter of semantics.

 About 100 "advisers" were in the attacking column of 1,500 Angolan troops when 
they captured Cafunfo, center of the diamond trade in the north, in July after 
a six-week offensive. By then, UNITA had fled. 
</P>
<P>
 One South African, who roared into Cafunfo on a tank, smiled as he recalled 
the victory -- and the party that followed. "We plundered the town," he said. 
His only regret, he added, was that he and his friends got too drunk to find 
any diamonds.

WIDENING GENDER GAP HELPS TO GIVE GOP ELECTION EDGE; POLITICS: DEMOCRATS ARE 
FACING PROBLEMS ATTRACTING MALE VOTERS, WHO ARE TURNING THEIR ANGER WITH 
CLINTON TO PARTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 If there's a secret ingredient in the high octane political mix fueling the 
Republican advance this fall, it might be testosterone.  
</P>
<P>
 In races across the country, Democrats are facing substantial -- in some 
instances enormous -- deficits among male voters. Indeed, in many statewide 
elections, the ability to attract men may be the principal agent of natural 
selection between Democrats who survive in this autumn of their discontent and 
those who are swept away. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem appears especially intractable for several Democratic women in 
high-profile races -- such as Texas Gov. Ann Richards -- but it is hardly 
unique to them. Democrats in every region of the country, of every ideological 
persuasion, are having man trouble. "Men have turned away from Bill Clinton," 
said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, "and now they are turning away from the 
(Democratic) party." 
</P>
<P>
 Republican success with men has always been the flip side of the more highly 
touted gender gap: the tilt toward Democrats among women that first emerged 
during the Ronald Reagan era. But this year, the Republican advantage among men 
has opened to levels that are striking even by recent political history. And in 
most races it is too large for Democrats to overcome even by running well among 
women, who typically constitute just over half of all voters. "This year, 
what's really problematic is (that) the deficit with men is so great that the 
advantage with women can't make it up," Lake said. 
</P>
<P>
 Disaffection with Clinton, sympathy for hard-line Republican appeals on issues 
like crime and taxes and greater resistance to activist government have 
combined to move men sharply toward the GOP this fall, pollsters in both 
parties said. "Men tend to express themselves in anger at the President; women 
express themselves in fear about the future," said GOP pollster Frank Luntz. 
"And anger tends to produce a much more Republican vote." 
</P>
<P>
 That trend is apparent in both national numbers and individual races. In 1992, 
women were somewhat more disposed than men to support Democratic congressional 
candidates but the differences were modest: 56% of women and 51% of men voted 
Democrat for Congress that year, according to a Los Angeles Times exit poll. 
Gallup Organization Inc. surveys in 1986 and 1988 found similarly slim 
differences between men and women in their congressional voting preferences. 
</P>
<P>
 But now a chasm has opened between the generic voting intentions of men and 
women in the congressional campaign. In a Times Poll conducted last week, women 
preferred Democratic over Republican congressional candidates by six percentage 
points. Men, in sharp contrast, preferred Republicans over Democrats by 18 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the biggest gender gaps in history," said Stanley B. Greenberg, 
Clinton's pollster. "It is big, big." 
</P>
<P>
 Big enough to affect not only contests involving liberal Democrats, who have 
often had trouble with men, but more moderate and conservative party members 
with political profiles that ordinarily might appeal to male voters. 
</P>
<P>
 For liberals, trouble with men is widespread. The most recent public poll in 
Ohio shows Democratic senatorial nominee Joel Hyatt narrowly leading Republican 
Lt. Gov. Mike DeWine among women; but DeWine holds a solid 10-point overall 
advantage because he is crushing Hyatt by 17 points among men. In New York, 
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's comfortable lead among women voters is more than offset 
by a 16-point deficit among men, producing a statistical dead heat in his race 
against Republican George Pataki, according to a new poll by the Marist 
Institute of Public Opinion.  
</P>
<P>
 Moderate Democrats are not faring any better. Oklahoma Rep. Dave McCurdy, the 
Democratic senatorial nominee against conservative Republican Jim Inhofe, wears 
cowboy boots, touts his tough line against welfare recipients and stresses his 
support for the military installations in the state. He even has run a 
television ad showing him riding in a pickup truck with a shotgun on the rack 
behind him. No matter: While McCurdy still leads among women, Inhofe has surged 
into the lead by running up a 15-point advantage among men, according to the 
most recent public survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, moderate Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper is facing a 15-point gap among 
men with folksy Republican lawyer/actor Fred Thompson in their Tennessee Senate 
race; in Arizona, Republican Rep. Jon Kyl leads Democratic Rep. Sam Coppersmith 
by 25 points among men, according to a survey completed last week. Both 
Democrats trail overall. 
</P>
<P>
 For women Democratic candidates in the most high-profile races, deficits with 
men are a common condition. In the California gubernatorial race, the 
phenomenon is actually relatively muted. The most recent Times Poll found Gov. 
Pete Wilson leading Democrat Kathleen Brown by 9 points among men, while women 
are splitting evenly. But both Bonnie Campbell, the Democratic gubernatorial 
nominee in Iowa, and Ann Wynia, the Democratic senatorial nominee in Minnesota, 
faced double-digit disadvantages among men in recent surveys. Both narrowly 
trail overall. 
</P>
<P>
 No race involving a woman appears more defined by gender than Texas Gov. 
Richards' struggle against Republican George W. Bush, the former President's 
son. The most recent Texas Poll showed the race a dead heat. But Richards -- a 
moderate who hunts, speaks a spicy good ol' gal Texas patois and has built 
prisons the way pharaohs built pyramids -- leads Bush by 12 points among women, 
and trails by 17 points among men. To Candace Windel, the Texas Poll director, 
the race reduces to a simple calculus: "If more boys show up to vote than 
girls, he wins. If more girls show up to vote than boys, she wins," she told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Notwithstanding the difficulties that Democratic women are having attracting 
male votes, the key factor in the gender polarization this fall appears to be 
the party, not the sex, of the candidates. Democratic men like McCurdy and 
Hyatt are having no more success with male voters than Democratic women like 
Richards and Wynia. And Republican women like Senate nominee Olympia J. Snowe 
in Maine and Maryland gubernatorial nominee Ellen Sauerbrey lead among men in 
their races. 
</P>
<P>
 Sauerbrey still trails in her contest, though, because Democratic opponent 
Parris Glendening has kept her to a small advantage among men, while exploiting 
the flip side of the gender gap to amass a double-digit lead among women. 
That's a common profile for Democrats -- of both genders -- running well this 
fall: Sens. Edward M. Kennedy in Massachusetts and Dianne Feinstein in 
California, for instance, have regained the leads in their contests by battling 
back to virtual dead-heats among men, while running up substantial leads with 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 With those exceptions, why are so many Democrats running aground with men this 
fall? Analysts cite three principal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Gender polarization over President Clinton. One of Clinton's most striking 
successes in 1992 was overcoming the huge disadvantages among men that largely 
sank Walter F. Mondale and Michael S. Dukakis during the 1980s. With the help 
of Ross Perot -- who siphoned off a fifth of men -- Clinton narrowly carried 
the male vote in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But two years into his presidency, attitudes toward Clinton are again dividing 
along gender lines. In the latest Times Poll, women essentially split on 
Clinton's job performance, giving him a 48% negative to 46% positive grade. Men 
were considerably more negative, with 53% disapproving of Clinton's performance 
and just 41% approving. 
</P>
<P>
 Political analysts said that Clinton has two distinct problems with men. With 
older men, said Republican pollster Bill McInturff, issues like gays in the 
military, Clinton's avoidance of military service during Vietnam and a 
perception of irresolution in foreign affairs have produced a sense "that Bill 
Clinton in some broad aggregate ways is not representing the values they want 
represented in the presidency." 
</P>
<P>
 With younger men -- particularly those without college educations whose 
incomes remain stagnant or declining -- the President is being buffeted by the 
same economic discontent that moved those voters away from Bush and toward 
Clinton and Perot just two years ago. "If there was a Republican President now, 
I have no doubt they would be angry at him," Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Perot factor: As the continuing disillusionment among young men suggests, 
the flight away from Democrats by men reflects another phenomenon: the souring 
of 1992 Perot voters -- who were disproportionately male -- on Clinton and 
Congress. One result in the latest Times Poll underscores that trend: Fully 62% 
of independent men disapproved of Clinton's job performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The environment: The issues at the head of the line this fall tend to both 
exacerbate gender differences and move men toward the GOP, operatives in both 
parties agreed. Hard-line Republican positions on crime and welfare -- 
emphasizing punishment over prevention and strict time limits for welfare 
recipients -- cut more deeply with men than women. So does the core GOP 
economic agenda of tax cuts and balancing the federal budget. Even California's 
Proposition 187 -- which would deny most public services to illegal immigrants 
and has been strongly backed by Republicans in the state -- draws much more 
support from men than women, according to the latest Times Poll.

THOUSANDS OF YOUTHS PROTEST PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In the largest student protests to date against Proposition 187, thousands of 
Southern California youths walked off campuses Friday, prompting a tactical 
alert by police, tense standoffs with riot-ready officers and scattered reports 
of fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was arrested or seriously injured during demonstrations in Van Nuys and 
Chatsworth, where an estimated 2,500 impassioned teen-agers waved Mexican and 
Central American flags and chanted in Spanish, "No 187!" and "The people united 
will never be defeated." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our dream is to go to school and be somebody in life, and if this law passes 
we won't be able to fulfill our dreams," said Blanca Menjivar, a junior at 
Birmingham High School in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 2,000 students took to the streets in Oxnard and Camarillo in Ventura 
County. "We're fighting for our parents, our loved ones, everybody," Oxnard 
College student Lorenzo Zwaal told the crowd, which gathered in a downtown 
Oxnard park. 
</P>
<P>
 The mostly peaceful demonstration was marred at the end by fistfights that 
police attributed to gang rivalries rather than political fervor. Police 
arrested four students, three of them juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was more of a gang thing than a Proposition 187 thing," said Oxnard police 
spokesman David Keith. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest showdown of the afternoon occurred when scores of helmeted police 
armed with batons and shotguns faced off with hundreds of students at the Van 
Nuys Civic Center. After a standoff lasting about an hour, police loaded the 
students onto buses and took them to the football field at nearby Van Nuys High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one student was struck by a police baton and others were sprayed with 
pepper spray. Some students -- including a contingent who had marched along 
streets from Birmingham High, bringing with them supporters from at least three 
other campuses -- complained about being temporarily detained behind locked 
gates on the football field. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration began early Friday morning at Fulton Middle School in Van 
Nuys, where at least 200 students left the campus and walked 2 1/2 miles to 
Monroe High School in North Hills, joined by other marchers along the way. The 
group then walked to Sepulveda Middle School, unaware that students there had 
Friday off. 
</P>
<P>
 Undeterred, the demonstrators continued to Van Nuys High, where more students 
were drawn into the march, some jumping fences to join in. 
</P>
<P>
 At about the same time, about 400 youths walked off campus at Birmingham High 
and set off on a march of their own -- picking up classmates from Mulholland 
and Van Nuys middle schools as well as supportive passersby. Motorists honked 
in approval while apartment dwellers leaned over their balconies for a better 
view, smiling and raising their fists. 
</P>
<P>
 Teodora Sandoval de Rodriguez, who lives near the Van Nuys government center, 
was at the corner of Van Nuys and Victory boulevards when she saw the march. 
She decided to join. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to show them my support," she said. "I think it's great that they 
have commitment to protest like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Some school administrators also went along -- walking or following closely in 
cars to ensure the students' safety. "I monitored them all the way through," 
said Birmingham High Principal Jerry Kleinman. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the Birmingham and Fulton groups reached the Van Nuys Civic Center 
and nearby Van Nuys High, they were met by a throng of Los Angeles police clad 
in riot gear, some wielding shotguns and carrying cartridges with rubber 
bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 Marchers complained that the police were overreacting by dispatching so many 
officers to the mall, which includes courts, a police station and federal 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "All those weapons!" said Ivan Bertran, 17, a senior at Van Nuys High. "We've 
got signs. Like we're really going to hurt them with signs." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Leticia Zelaya, 15, a sophomore at Van Nuys High: "Freedom of speech is 
supposed to mean you can say what you want to say. The cops are making a big 
deal of this. They're treating us like animals. We ain't animals." 
</P>
<P>
 About 2 p.m., six yellow school buses roared to a stop in the middle of Van 
Nuys Boulevard. Over a bullhorn, officers instructed the students to get on the 
buses or face arrest. The buses took the students to Van Nuys High, where they 
boarded buses for their home campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Marchers kept to the sidewalks along most of their routes but there was some 
traffic disruption. The most serious trouble reported by Los Angeles police was 
smashed windows in a patrol car and vandalism at a convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles police and county sheriff's departments remained on tactical 
alert throughout the day. Police also braced for possible trouble at the 
homecoming game and dance at Van Nuys High on Friday night.  
</P>
<P>
 In another Friday demonstration, about 2,000 students from Chatsworth High 
School took part in a calm and organized rally followed by an impromptu march 
through area streets. Police reported no trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 There were smaller student demonstrations Friday in Venice, Westchester, South 
Los Angeles and San Gabriel and at three San Diego schools in opposition to 
Proposition 187, which seeks to deny public services, including education, to 
illegal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 School-based protests against the initiative have been rising in number and 
fervor in recent weeks as the Nov. 8 election nears, while parents and leaders 
of the campaign against Proposition 187 have been trying to defuse enthusiasm 
for the demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Board of Education scheduled a special meeting Monday to 
discuss the walkouts, the district's response and the possibility of more 
disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "As it gets closer to the election, I think it's appropriate that we 
coordinate the response," said board President Mark Slavkin.  
</P>
<P>
 "To disrupt school and leave campus, I think undermines the cause," Slavkin 
said.

POTENTIAL JURORS MAY SEE POLITICAL ARTICLES, ITO SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Having cut off prospective jurors in the O.J. Simpson case from all media just 
days before the California elections, Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito said 
Friday that he has directed his staff to compile campaign clippings so the 
panelists can vote intelligently Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 That unusual step grew out of Ito's equally unorthodox order to prospective 
jurors in the case: Rather than simply avoid publicity about the Simpson trial, 
they must have no exposure to any media.  
</P>
<P>
 That is an admonition that many prospective jurors have had difficulty obeying 
but one that Ito has rigorously enforced. Friday, he bounced one prospective 
juror for listening to traffic reports on the radio and another because she 
said she had a television on while she was working around the house. 
</P>
<P>
 When one man told Ito that the bus he rode to work had a radio playing, Ito 
proposed a solution: "Go to the mall, go to the Sav-On, and get some earplugs." 
</P>
<P>
 But then it turned out that the man had watched the "Mickey Mouse Club" on 
television one day, enough to violate Ito's order. "I'm going to save you the 
trip to the Sav-On," Ito said, and excused the man from further service. 
</P>
<P>
 Many prospective jurors have complained that they find Ito's restriction 
frustrating, and one who was questioned Friday said she was especially troubled 
because of the approaching elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not happy," the outspoken 66-year-old Brentwood woman said, "because I 
want to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito assured her, however, that he had directed his staff to work with The 
Times and the Daily News of Los Angeles to compile a booklet of all stories 
related to state and local campaigns, starting with the coverage on Oct. 20, 
two days after he imposed the admonition. Ito credited Times columnist Bill 
Boyarsky with that suggestion, and it represents the judge's first 
acknowledgment that the Simpson case has distracted attention from the 
political races. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson was arrested June 17 and has pleaded not guilty to the murders of his 
ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 After a salacious book purporting to tell the story of Nicole Simpson's final 
months was released in mid-October, Ito ordered prospective jurors to avoid all 
media and to stay out of bookstores.  
</P>
<P>
 Ito has not said whether he will order jurors sequestered for all or part of 
the coming trial. Prosecutors support full sequestration, but Simpson's lawyers 
are opposed, fearing that isolation might attract different types of jurors 
than those who could serve if they were allowed to return home at night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brentwood woman, whose candor impressed lawyers for both sides, warned Ito 
that she too believes sequestration would change the character of the jury: 
"What you're going to get are people who are lonely or who have very 
uninteresting lives," she said, adding that she would have great difficulty 
serving if it meant spending several months in a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the legal arguments regarding sequestration, it would add 
substantially to the cost of the trial, which, according to County Supervisor 
Mike Antonovich, already is among the most expensive in county history. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures released by Antonovich's office Friday show that the county has spent 
$912,140 on the case, exceeding expenditures for the Charles Manson or Sirhan 
Sirhan trials. The most expensive case in county history was the child-abuse 
prosecution of the McMartin family in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, some legal experts applauded Ito's promise to give prospective jurors 
information about state and local campaigns, a concession that might allow them 
to participate knowledgeably in the coming elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a great idea that the judge is trying to find some reasonable 
accommodation to allow these people to be informed citizens at the same time 
that they are being asked to serve on this case," said Laurie Levenson, a 
Loyola law school professor. "I've never heard of anything quite like this, but 
I give him a lot of credit." 
</P>
<P>
 In August, acting Secretary of State Tony Miller asked Ito to recess the trial 
on Nov. 7 and Nov. 8 so that interest in the proceedings would not distract 
attention from the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito denied that request without explanation, and instead scheduled an eagerly 
anticipated hearing for the day before the elections, ensuring that much media 
attention will be focused on the courtroom rather than the campaign on the 
final day before voters go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 At that hearing, Ito will decide whether to remove the television camera from 
his courtroom for the duration of the trial. News organizations filed a lengthy 
motion Friday opposing that idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Written by attorney Kelli L. Sager and filed on behalf of The Times and 13 
other organizations, the motion argues that ending the TV coverage of the 
proceedings would do little to address Ito's concern about media excesses and 
would deny the public the chance to watch the celebrated case unfold. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue," Sager wrote, "is whether the presence of cameras in the courtroom 
during the trial would have some demonstrable negative impact -- either on the 
rights of the parties, the dignity of the court, or the orderly conduct of the 
proceedings -- which outweighs the considerable benefits of allowing full and 
complete coverage of this significant criminal proceeding." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito has cited two reasons that might justify a decision to pull the plug on 
the televised proceedings -- an erroneous KNBC report about DNA testing in the 
case, and the broadcast of the faces of jurors serving in another trial as they 
milled about in a hallway outside Ito's courtroom. Neither of those stories 
relied on the camera in Ito's courtroom, and Sager argues that removing that 
camera would not address Ito's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The removal of cameras from the courtroom will not reduce the likelihood of 
news reports containing inaccurate information, and certainly would not prevent 
the dissemination of 'leaked' information that the court would rather be kept 
secret," Sager's motion states. "Termination of electronic coverage would serve 
no purpose other than to remove the most accurate and verifiable source of 
information available to the press and public." 
</P>
<P>
 As jury selection in the Simpson case has ground ahead slowly in recent days, 
attorneys' tempers have flared occasionally, and there sometimes has been an 
air of giddiness at the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, the same juror who expressed concerns about isolation while the 
campaign is under way described Simpson as "a hunk of a fellow" and took a 
surprising swipe at Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark. When Clark asked the woman 
whether there was anything about the prosecution that bothered her, the woman 
responded: "I think your skirts are too short. How about that?" 
</P>
<P>
 The remark drew chuckles in the courtroom and Ito added: "I was wondering when 
someone was going to mention that." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark then stepped out from behind the counsel table to display a knee-length 
skirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, the day's events were enlivened by a surprise appearance of the 
Stanford University marching band. In town for today's game against UCLA, about 
20 band members, instruments in hand, lined the steps to the court building 
shortly after noon and played as attorneys returned from lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had field rehearsal, and we didn't want to go to that," said Ari Mukamal, 
social manager for the band. "So we came here." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Shapiro, one of Simpson's lead attorneys, charged through the band 
gantlet without pausing. Once inside the building, he turned and looked back at 
the spectacle outside. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, he said, "a new low in tasteless behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., Simpson's other lead counsel, said he found the band 
performance bizarre and added, "I hope UCLA trounces them tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides return to court Monday morning to continue questioning prospective 
jurors. So far, 75 have been questioned and 38 have been excused, mostly for 
exposure to media. Those who remain eligible to serve on the jury have been 
asked to return Wednesday.

MARKETS RISE ON ECONOMY'S 3.4% QUARTERLY SURGE 
</P>

<P>
 The U.S. economy expanded at a healthy annual rate of 3.4% during the third 
quarter of the year, the Commerce Department said Friday, reporting a 
bigger-than-expected growth spurt that increases the likelihood of additional 
interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve Board. 
</P>
<P>
 While most analysts and economists are convinced that the Fed is likely to 
boost rates at its next policy-making meeting on Nov. 15, the financial markets 
greeted Friday's report with enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average surged 55.51 to 3930.66, enjoying its biggest 
daily rise since a 61.2-point jump on Oct. 11. The yield on the Treasury's key 
30-year bond fell to 7.95%, another sign of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors and traders were reassured because the report on economic growth 
also contained a modest inflation figure, an annual rate of just 2.7% during 
the quarter, measuring prices paid by businesses as well as consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of moderate growth and mild inflation suggests that the 
expansion can be sustained with only modest adjustments in interest rates to 
keep prices in check, analysts said. However, there are some price increases 
for commodities and tightening of labor markets for several categories of 
skilled workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy is not overheating," said Robert Barr, deputy chief economist for 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "We think the Federal Reserve wants to err on the 
side of having less growth and less inflation -- that's why they are probably 
going to raise rates at the next meeting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue now seems to be not whether the Federal Reserve will increase 
interest rates, but by how much. Since five rate hikes have not slowed the 
economy appreciably since February, the Fed is likely to believe that it can 
keep squeezing without running a serious risk of tipping the country into a new 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's reported 3.4% growth rate in the economy is substantially higher than 
the 2% to 3% figure predicted by many economists. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion in the national economy is measured through the gross domestic 
product -- a statistical attempt to count every economic transaction in the 
country from haircuts to movie ticket sales to the fabrication of a ton of 
steel. The GDP increase of 3.4%, or $45.1 billion, during the year's third 
quarter, compared with an advance of 4.1% in the previous period, according to 
the Commerce Department's Friday report. 
</P>
<P>
 The economy's expansion was driven largely by enthusiastic consumer spending, 
noted Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who chairs the President's Council of Economic 
Advisers. Consumer outlays rose a hefty $26.1 billion during the quarter ended 
Sept. 30, compared to $11.5 billion in the previous quarter. There was a strong 
"rebound in purchases of motor vehicles from a sharp drop in the second 
quarter," said Lewis Alexander, the department's chief economist. 
</P>
<P>
 The brisk demand for products during the summer also generated a boost in 
business inventories, as companies expanded output to meet a surge in orders. 
For example, production of some popular car models and home computers has been 
unable to keep pace with demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Business investments in new equipment and machinery also continued growing at 
a rapid rate during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials hope that Friday's news will translate into 
political gains for many beleaguered Democratic candidates. The GDP report, 
combining strong growth with low inflation, "is the best of all possible worlds 
where economic facts and figures are concerned," Vice President Al Gore told 
reporters at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 But Republicans appear to be convinced that they can make big gains at the 
polls Nov. 8 and that the market's uncertain pattern in recent months 
represents a rejection of President Clinton's policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to point out is that we're at a crossroads," said Rep. H. 
James Saxton (R-N.J.). "We think we are headed in the wrong direction." 
</P>
<P>
 The economy's production of goods and services has increased at a rate of 4% 
during the past four quarters, far above the 2.5% figure considered by Fed 
officials to produce growth without inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you listen to what (Federal Reserve Chairman) Alan Greenspan says, you 
have to believe the Fed looks at this GDP report and it strengthens the case 
for higher interest rates," said Marko A. Budgyk, managing director of Houlihan 
Lokey Howard & Zukin, a Los Angeles investment management firm that handles 
funds for institutions and wealthy investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Penzer, vice president and senior economist for Bank of America, 
agreed with that assessment, noting that inflation over the last four quarters 
has been "fairly low and modest." 
</P>
<P>
 To reach the Fed's desired growth rate of 2.5%, Penzer said, the central bank 
needs to drive up the federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each 
other for overnight loans. The figure, now 4.75%, is likely to go to 5.25% 
after the next meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that he hopes the strategy will work. "I'm optimistic they will get 
the soft landing they want, reaching 2.5%" without producing a recession, he 
said. 
</P>

COMMERCE; UNIONS SEEING RED AS GERMAN BLUE LAWS EASE; MUCH TO THE CHAGRIN OF 
LABOR, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CHIP AWAY AT THE COUNTRY'S SACRED FREE DAY WITH 
OCCASIONAL SUNDAY OPENINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Although Lieselotte Jaeckel has worked at the Karstadt department store here 
for 18 years, Sunday was the first time she ever labored on the traditional day 
of rest. 
</P>
<P>
 For four hours of cashiering, Jaeckel received 2 1/2 times her normal pay, 
transportation costs and a small bottle of sparkling wine -- a token of 
management's appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, "I'll never do it again," Jaeckel said. "It's clear this is the first 
step toward Sunday work." 
</P>
<P>
 Sundays are feiertag in Germany, free day, rest-and-recuperation day, a time 
for the family in a hard-fought, union-won, 37 1/2-hour workweek in which 
stores close at 6:30 p.m. on weekdays and 2 p.m. on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kaiserslautern has joined a growing number of German towns chipping away 
at that tradition via a loophole in the country's strict law on store hours 
that prohibits Sunday shopping. The law says a community may open stores up to 
four times a year in connection with a local fair or festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The results are, of course, mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers are happy, workers are mad, and the union is suing the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiserslautern belongs to the western state of Rhineland-Palatinate, which 
once had a central administration to which communities could apply to open on 
special Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 The larger cities in the state had an unwritten agreement never to do so. As 
long as one stayed closed, the others did not have to worry about losing 
business to the competition. Thus, stores could avoid overtime and union 
confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
 But authority to decide on Sunday shopping was given over to the communities, 
and, in the middle of a recession last year, Social Democratic Mayor Gerhard 
Piontek and the Kaiserslautern retailers group decided to try it. The city of 
100,000 has 15% unemployment and loses customers to larger municipalities of 
Mannheim, Karlsruhe and Mainz. 
</P>
<P>
 Big department stores did not join in last year. But when they saw the huge 
Sunday crowds, they also saw the writing on the wall. This year, they opted to 
open. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was not easy. About two months ago, Karstadt manager Wolfgang 
Pohl asked his betriebsrat , or mandatory in-house union council, to agree to 
the October opening. Workers said no. The store took the issue to arbitration 
and won the right to open after agreeing to 150% overtime pay -- 10 hours wages 
for a four-hour day. 
</P>
<P>
 The German retail workers union then sued the city and sought a temporary 
injunction to block the opening. They lost when an administrative court in 
Koblenz ruled that working one Sunday a year does not represent undue hardship 
for clerks; the long-term challenge of the legality of the special Sunday 
openings is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Hermann Heinrich, Karstadt's union leader, said that if the workers agree to 
one Sunday, management will want four, one city will follow another and soon 
workers will be asked to work nights, weekends and all sorts of unorthodox 
schedules. "This law is for the protection for workers," Heinrich said. 
"There's a domino effect." 
</P>
<P>
 German workers are among the world's highest paid and best cared for. They 
normally get six weeks of vacation a year, a 13th month of salary, plus extra 
Christmas and vacation bonuses. They fear an expansion of their workweek and, 
because management is always trying to cut labor costs, believe no new 
employees would be hired if shopping hours are lengthened. 
</P>
<P>
 Union representatives and even many retailers insist that German shoppers 
stick to a fixed budget, do not buy on credit and do not spend more money when 
shops are open longer. So why do so? "If you wake up a demand in the customer, 
he will have this demand in the future," Heinrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the demand, it seems, is already there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sunday shopping is great," said Karin Persau, 33, a working mother who 
normally juggles shopping on her lunch hour. Pointing to clothes she had bought 
for her husband and daughter, she added, "I probably wouldn't have bought these 
things if I hadn't gone shopping today." 
</P>
<P>
 And on Monday, Karstadt manager Pohl declared the previous day "a full 
success," with sales as brisk as a Saturday before Christmas.

CRIME; RIO STRUGGLES TO PULL ITSELF FROM CORRUPTION QUAGMIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crime-weary parishioners at Masses throughout this staunchly Catholic city 
will utter a special prayer Sunday from their archbishop asking for divine help 
to "stop the climate of insecurity in the city" where daily more than 20 people 
are murdered, four kidnaped and hundreds robbed or otherwise assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 While Archbishop Eugenio Sales has plenty of faith in divine intervention, he 
also believes that it might help if the federal government also brought out 
M-16s, machine guns and heavy artillery. So he has joined hundreds of 
politicians, business leaders and community activists who want the president to 
call in the army to lay siege to the 400 shantytown communities that have 
become synonymous with crime in this nation's premier city. 
</P>
<P>
 Their unprecedented request may get the go-ahead early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, President Itamar Franco will discuss with Rio de Janeiro Gov. Nilo 
Batista the use of 20,000 troops to encircle troubled neighborhoods, many of 
which have become havens for heavily armed drug traffickers and bandits who 
prey on the more affluent residents. 
</P>
<P>
 But government sources say the meeting is merely a formality. Franco, 
newspapers report, has already made up his mind to declare a state of emergency 
in Rio if necessary to use the military by mid-November to go after an 
estimated 1,800 drug chiefs employing up to 50,000 soldiers. Batista, who 
opposes the idea, will be invited to jump aboard this train or be run over by 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 The possible use of troops, which all sides agree is risky because soldiers 
are not trained for such action, is a measure of Brazil's desperation as it 
struggles to rescue its showcase city, whose image of famous beaches, mountains 
and Carnaval is sinking in a quagmire of crime, poverty and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost one of every 1,300 Rio residents is killed annually, most in shoot-outs 
between traffickers, by murderous police or by robbers. Gunfire between warring 
drug lords this week interrupted classes for 5,000 students. Bandits routinely 
kidnap executives for million-dollar ransoms, while robbers brazenly barricade 
traffic tunnels leading out of the city and attack commuters during the 
afternoon rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Rio is rife with corruption, as symbolized by massive electoral 
fraud in the state in last month's national elections. Voter fraud, which many 
lay at the feet of the president of the state assembly, was so extensive that 
results were thrown out and a new election for most state posts was scheduled 
for November. 
</P>
<P>
 Stories of police incompetence, brutality and corruption are legend. More than 
30 officers await trial in separate incidents in which they -- for hire or 
revenge -- gunned down innocents, some as young as 8. 
</P>
<P>
 When state officials burst into the home of an organized-crime chief four 
months ago, they discovered a ledger showing scores of police receiving 
payoffs, some as much as $900,000. Residents report watching officers outside 
their home splitting up suitcases filled with loot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rio lives in a state of undeclared civil war," President-elect Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso told television crews while touring the Czech Republic this 
week. "The president of the state legislature is suspected of electoral fraud. 
All of this, plus the massacres and the rise of crime, are telling us that the 
time to act is now." 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that Rio has been on a rapid slide for a decade. Since 1988, 
tourism dollars have dropped by $800 million annually. Of Brazil's 35 largest 
banks, only one is still based here. Twenty years ago, Rio had 101 of the 
nation's 500 largest private businesses; it has 65 now. A decade ago, Rio had 
half of Brazil's stock market activity; it now accounts for 12%. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the push to use the army is being led by figures outside the 
state, who say that as Rio goes, so goes Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rio de Janeiro is not only a patrimony of the state of Rio de Janeiro, it is 
a patrimony of Brazil," said Geddek Viria Lima, a congressman from the state of 
Bahia and supporter of military intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoso, who takes office in January, said he is even considering temporarily 
moving the presidency from the nation's capital of Brasilia to Rio to supervise 
military action in the state. "Right now," he said, "Rio is a mess."

SEARCH FOR 2 MISSING BOYS CONTINUES; OFFICIALS BAFFLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 80 law officers and volunteers probed with sticks and trudged through 
woods dense with kudzu Friday, searching for any trace of two little boys said 
by their mother to have been snatched by a carjacker. 
</P>
<P>
 As that fruitless search was ending, another began: Tracking dogs, helicopters 
and deputies in bulletproof vests swarmed over another wooded area after a 
child reported seeing a man matching the suspect's description. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, in a case that has baffled authorities and residents of this rural 
town, nothing came of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The breaks have not been coming like we thought they would. It's 
unbelievable," Sheriff Howard Wells said of the investigation into the 
disappearance of 3-year-old Michael Smith and 14-month-old Alex Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, their mother, Susan Smith, 23, said a man with a gun forced his 
way into her car at a traffic light and then after a few miles forced her out 
in an isolated area, driving away with her sons still in their safety seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a family spokeswoman, she and the boys' father, David Smith, appealed 
again Friday for the return of the children and thanked the searchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing the missing boys, the spokeswoman, Margaret Gregory, added: "We 
miss you, we love you, and we want you home." 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Smith filed for divorce last month, though the sheriff said he did not 
consider that a factor in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators questioned David Smith on Friday. Asked why, Wells 
replied: "We are looking for a possible motive for a crime of this type. At 
present we haven't had a ransom demand, we have not had a motive where someone 
would be mad at the family." 
</P>
<P>
 While pursuing the case as a carjacking and abduction, he said: "We are not 
ruling out anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Friday, four teams of searchers were assembled at the thickly wooded 
spot where Susan Smith said she last saw her sons, a road about 10 miles 
outside Union. She had run to a house nearby to report being forced from the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams fanned out over the four square miles near a lake that had already 
been searched by divers for Susan Smith's car, a burgundy 1990 Mazda Protege. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiking up a slope with his breath frosting the air after overnight 
temperatures in the 30s, volunteer John Phillips voiced everyone's hope that 
the boys were somewhere else and safe. "I hope we don't find anything," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 What they did find was very little. A state agent said an article of 
children's clothing that was picked up was the wrong size. 
</P>
<P>
 Searchers were scrambled yet again after a 12-year-old girl called the 
sheriff's office to report that she had just seen a man matching the suspect's 
description emerging from woods behind a shopping mall on the opposite side of 
town.

MOTHER'S KIDNAP TALE COLLAPSES WITH DISCOVERY OF GIRL'S GRAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In one hand, Pauline Zile clutched a stuffed animal. With the other, she wiped 
the tears streaming from her red, swollen eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking into the TV camera, she made a near-hysterical plea for the return of 
her 7-year-old daughter, claiming Christina Holt had been abducted from a 
restroom at a flea market. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem: The woman kept referring to her daughter in the past tense. 
</P>
<P>
 Days later, police announced that Pauline Zile had concocted the abduction 
tale to cover up her daughter's beating death more than a month earlier at the 
hands of the girl's stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
 The grammatical slip was just one of the inconsistencies investigators 
uncovered in the death of the second-grader, whose body was found Friday in a 
shallow grave behind a convenience store in Tequesta, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think your daughter's just been missing for a few hours, you're not 
going to be talking about her, every line, in the past tense," said Jim 
Leljedal, a spokesman for the Broward County sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's stepfather, Walter John Zile, 32, was jailed without bail Thursday 
on charges of murder as well as aggravated child abuse, for two previous 
beatings the child allegedly suffered. He led police to the body. 
</P>
<P>
 John Zile confessed after learning his wife had talked about the death of her 
child, according to a police affidavit released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe Pauline Zile, 24, witnessed but did not participate in 
the beating. No charges were brought against her. 
</P>
<P>
 The tale began last weekend with Pauline Zile's gripping, detailed account of 
her daughter's purported abduction. She said she and Christina had wanted some 
special mother-daughter time, so they drove from their motel apartment in 
Riviera Beach to the Swap Shop flea market in Ft. Lauderdale last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 When they arrived, they immediately looked for the nearest restroom. Pauline 
Zile said she went into a stall and heard someone go into the stall next to her 
and assumed it was Christina. She told investigators she was talking to the 
girl and realized something was wrong when Christina didn't respond. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, investigators say, it was all a well-rehearsed performance.

S. KOREA PREMIER SURVIVES MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The South Korean prime minister and 23 Cabinet members survived a 
no-confidence motion Friday triggered by a bridge collapse in Seoul that killed 
32 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition Democratic Party had demanded that the Cabinet resign, arguing 
that the collapse and a boat fire four days later that killed 29 people prove 
the government's inability to manage state affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts have issued repeated warnings in recent years about lax safety 
standards on South Korea's bridges and public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assembly, controlled by the governing Democratic Liberal Party, 
retained Prime Minister Lee Yung Duk by a vote of 174-116. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-three members of the Cabinet also survived the no-confidence motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's offer to resign over the bridge collapse was rejected by President Kim 
Young Sam. Kim also refused to replace any Cabinet members. 
</P>
<P>
 Seoul's mayor was fired after the collapse, and eight senior city officials 
have been arrested.

CIA'S COVERT INDONESIA OPERATION IN THE 1950S ACKNOWLEDGED BY U.S.; COLD WAR: 
STATE DEPARTMENT PUBLISHES UNPRECEDENTED 600-PAGE HISTORY DOCUMENTING 
ANTI-COMMUNIST PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first official acknowledgment of its kind, the State Department has 
provided a detailed account of major covert operations launched by the CIA in 
Indonesia during the 1950s, when it feared growing Communist influence over 
President Sukarno. 
</P>
<P>
 A 600-page documentary history published this month shows that the Dwight D. 
Eisenhower Administration mounted clandestine intelligence operations to 
support anti-Communist rebels in Indonesia in what was, in some respects, a 
forerunner of the Bay of Pigs operations against Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 William Z. Slany, the State Department's official historian, wrote in an 
introduction that the new book represents "a transitional volume on the road to 
fuller release of important intelligence operations" carried out by the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the official documentary histories of U.S. foreign policy, which 
are called "Foreign Relations of the United States," have been written as 
though the CIA did not exist. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Slany said that before the new Indonesia volume, State 
Department histories had never published information about covert CIA 
operations -- with the single exception of some intelligence activities in 
Vietnam in the early 1960s, when the United States was an overt and active 
participant in that country's civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Indonesia was a more typical Cold War intelligence operation. Publicly, the 
United States maintained normal diplomatic relations with Sukarno's government 
in Jakarta. Meanwhile, the Eisenhower Administration secretly intervened in 
military actions against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State John Foster Dulles said at one key meeting that Sukarno was 
"dangerous, untrustworthy and by character susceptible to the Communist way of 
thinking." And so, in early 1958, the United States began secretly supplying 
and supporting dissident military groups on Indonesia's outer islands of 
Sumatra and Sulawesi. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is ample evidence that the United States encouraged and supported the 
rebellion, until it was clear that it was failing," the State Department 
historians concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Historians say the fact that the CIA mounted the covert operations in 
Indonesia was already known. Indonesia began complaining about the CIA's 
activities after it shot down and captured an American pilot, Allen Pope, who 
was bombing military targets in support of the rebels. Howard P. Jones, 
American ambassador to Indonesia, later wrote a book in which he acknowledged, 
and criticized, the covert intelligence operations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new State Department book makes public for the first time the 
Eisenhower Administration's decision-making, the internal policy papers and 
accounts of the meetings at which the covert operations were planned and 
launched. 
</P>
<P>
 Then-CIA Director Allen Dulles sat in on all the key strategy sessions, trying 
to manage the day-to-day details of an Asian land that he viewed through 
Western eyes. At one point, he told the National Security Council: "As a 
people, the Indonesians often do a lot of talking, accompanied by very little 
action." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1959, when it became clear that the rebels would fail, Eisenhower shifted 
course. Instead of backing the rebels, he decided to throw U.S. support to the 
regular Indonesian army that had been fighting them -- in hopes that military 
leaders would provide a counterweight to Sukarno and Indonesia's Communist 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the long term, that strategy was more effective. In 1965, amid a 
mysterious flurry of attempted coups, Indonesian military leaders led by Gen. 
Suharto took control of the country, gradually easing Sukarno from power. 
Suharto remains Indonesia's president today. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department history ends in 1960, and there is no evidence in it of 
any CIA role in the military's 1965 seizure of power. 
</P>
<P>
 "After it (the covert operation in support of the Indonesian rebels) failed in 
1958, we just backed off," former CIA Director William E. Colby said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the early 1960s, we had people there (in Indonesia) trying to find out 
what was going on but we didn't have any active cooperation (with the 
Indonesian military). . . . Our problem . . . was trying to find out what they 
were doing with the Soviets." 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department has been under pressure from Congress to provide more 
information about American intelligence operations since the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Historical Assn. criticized the State Department for publishing a 
history of the restoration of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi of Iran to his throne 
in 1953, without ever mentioning the CIA's well-documented role in returning 
him to power. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Congress passed a law requiring the CIA and other intelligence 
agencies to cooperate with State Department historians by giving them complete 
access to all information relevant to foreign policy decisions. The Indonesia 
book is the first one in which the State Department shows openly the extensive 
role of the CIA in the making of American foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indonesia book also underscores the cozy relationship between the CIA and 
the press during the Eisenhower era. 
</P>
<P>
 After American correspondents in Indonesia saw American pilots airdropping 
supplies to the rebels, the CIA director called executives at two publications 
seeking to keep the news from becoming public. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, one of the news stories described the supplies as falling to the 
rebels "like manna from heaven."

RUSSIAN LEGISLATORS OK TESTING OF FOREIGNERS FOR AIDS VIRUS; HEALTH: VOTE IN 
THE LOWER HOUSE IS NEARLY UNANIMOUS. BUT ACTIVISTS CALL THE BILL COSTLY, 
DISCRIMINATORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Russia's lower house of Parliament voted 247-1 Friday to require all 
foreigners who visit Russia to be tested for the virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, which sailed through the Duma on its second reading over the 
strenuous objections of AIDS activists, must still be passed by the upper house 
of Parliament and signed by President Boris N. Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 But if it becomes law, the measure will require those coming to Russia for 
"work or study or other purposes" either to be tested for HIV, the virus that 
causes AIDS, or to present a medical certificate showing that they are 
HIV-negative. Foreign residents of Russia who test positive for the virus could 
be deported. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS activists, doctors and even an official in the Health Ministry criticized 
the measure Friday, saying it is costly and discriminatory, makes a travesty of 
medical privacy and violates international human rights conventions that Russia 
has signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, they say, it will do nothing to stop the spread of AIDS in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "This might have been effective before, when Russians did not go abroad so 
much," said Nikolai Nedzelsky of the Russian Names Fund, which helps 
HIV-positive people. "Now many Russians are going overseas. . . . It's 
useless." 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS activist Kevin J. Gardner, co-founder of the Moscow-based Aesop Center, 
which has lobbied against the bill, called the measure "utterly unrealistic."  
</P>
<P>
 "AIDS is a convenient tool for . . . slamming foreigners and blaming them for 
the ills of Russian society," Gardner said. He argued that the money needed to 
test foreigners would be better spent on AIDS education programs, which are 
scanty here. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the Duma health care committee that sponsored the bill, Bella A. 
Denisenko, has in the past called the testing of foreigners "a matter of state 
security." 
</P>
<P>
 "We should erect a civilized barrier against infected foreigners coming in," 
she said in June, when the bill was approved on its first reading, according to 
the Moscow Times newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who don't want AIDS incidence in Russia to reach the level of Western 
nations should vote for the bill," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia has so far been spared the worst ravages of the AIDS epidemic, although 
public health officials have said that skyrocketing rates of sexually 
transmitted diseases and widespread public disdain for condom use are likely 
harbingers of an AIDS explosion to come. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Aug. 15, 740 Russian citizens and 450 foreigners were officially listed 
as infected with HIV, and 110 people had died of AIDS. Activists say the real 
numbers are much higher, because many people who suspect they may be infected 
try to avoid contact with the Russian public health system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Discrimination occurs in 99% of cases" when HIV-positive patients are entered 
into the official roster, Nedzelsky said. Today, Russians are routinely tested 
for HIV without their knowledge or consent, and sometimes people who test 
positive for the virus are not informed of the results or are told they have 
another disease, such as hepatitis-B, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who do test positive are often shunned, dismissed from their jobs or 
forced to move to another city, Nedzelsky said. The name and address of one 
AIDS patient in Siberia was broadcast by a local radio station, he said. And 
doctors in a Moscow suburb recently telephoned the parents of a 25-year-old man 
to inform them that their son had tested positive for HIV and was being sent to 
an AIDS clinic in the city, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new AIDS bill contains a clause that bans discrimination against 
HIV-infected people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very good clause, but there is no mechanism for its implementation, 
and it doesn't say what happens if people do discriminate," Nedzelsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the bill "guarantees" free medical treatment for AIDS victims, but 
desperately underfunded Russian hospitals lack the money, medicines and 
expertise to make good on such a promise, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a Soviet-era AIDS law, foreigners could be required to undergo testing. 
The law was applied sporadically, however, and usually against Africans, 
foreign students and some foreign workers. Infected people have been deported. 
</P>
<P>
 "This creates a false sense of security among Russians," said Irina Savelyeva 
of Aesop. "They believe that AIDS is connected only with foreigners, and 
without foreigners they will be safe." 
</P>
<P>
 The AIDS activists said they had not seen the final version of Friday's bill; 
Nedzelsky said lawmakers had refused to give it to them. 
</P>
<P>
 But a recent draft of the bill contained a clause that would allow authorities 
to test anyone deemed at risk of spreading HIV, Gardner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The phrase is so unclear it could be taken to mean anyone -- or whoever the 
authorities decide to target," he said. "If someone comes in for dental 
treatment, for example, and the dental worker thinks the person looks like a 
homosexual or a prostitute, the worker could demand that the person be tested 
or have a certificate." 
</P>
<P>
 The law would probably create a lucrative black market for fake medical 
certificates for those who are HIV-positive or who do not wish to be tested, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vadim Pokrovsky, the chief AIDS expert at the Health Ministry, said mandatory 
testing should be required only of blood donors. He expressed fears that 
lawmakers are moving toward allowing universal mandatory testing.

SOLZHENITSYN RIPS ALMOST EVERYONE IN PARLIAMENT SPEECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn thundered into Russian politics Friday with his 
first speech to Parliament -- a blistering dissection of post-Soviet life in 
which democracy remains just a dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers greeted the gray-bearded writer warmly and applauded often early in 
his 50-minute speech.But they cooled and applause grew sparse as he turned his 
ire on virtually every political current, from market reformers to Communists 
to the leaders of restive regions and republics. 
</P>
<P>
 The 75-year-old writer, who crossed Russia by train last summer after 20 years 
in exile, cast himself Friday as a messenger from the suffering people. 
</P>
<P>
 But some in the audience of the Duma, Parliament's lower house, wondered 
whether the Nobel laureate wasn't as out of touch with the Russian people as 
the politicians he condemned. 
</P>
<P>
 Solzhenitsyn ran through the painful changes that have accompanied Russia's 
post-Soviet turn toward capitalism: crime, inflation, industrial decline, poor 
health, the dominance of the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia is emerging from communism on the most twisted, painful and awkward 
path," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Solzhenitsyn shouted often and gesticulated dramatically. The country, he 
argued, is still run by Soviet " nomenklatura turncoats disguised as 
democrats." 
</P>
<P>
 "We must admit honestly, this is not a democracy. Now we have an oligarchy, 
since the power belongs to a limited number of people," he said.

WALESA FACES A SOLIDARITY AGAINST HIM; POLAND: HIGHHANDED MOVES BY THE 
PRESIDENT AND ONETIME UNION LEADER ALIENATE HIS FORMER ALLIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 For a moment it looked like a flashback from the 1980s, a dramatic televised 
scene of Poland's struggle to overthrow communism, featuring top players in the 
Solidarity reform movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Solidarity strategist Bronislaw Geremek issued a stern warning about the 
sanctity of democracy. Solidarity journalist Tadeusz Mazowiecki lectured about 
civilian control of the military. And Solidarity activist Wladyslaw Frasyniuk 
accused the Polish president of authoritarian tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Lech Walesa, the Solidarity leader, also joined the fray. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike in the 1980s, he was not leading this assault: Walesa was its 
target. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wish to express our deepest concern that our fragile Polish democracy may 
be threatened," Frasyniuk, now a Polish lawmaker, told Walesa during a recent 
parliamentary meeting. "And it is beyond human imagination that this threat may 
come from Lech Walesa of all people, the champion of the struggle against 
communism." 
</P>
<P>
 Walesa, the Gdansk shipyard electrician who helped bring communism to its 
knees in Eastern Europe, winning the Nobel Peace Prize and the Polish 
presidency along the way, has become public enemy No. 1 in his own country. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a series of highhanded moves, apparently calculated to boost his 
reelection chances next year, the image of Walesa-the-Democrat has devolved 
into Walesa-the-Despot. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unprecedented vote, the Sejm, the lower house of Parliament, 
overwhelmingly approved a motion this month that accused him of destabilizing 
Poland's constitutional order and posing a threat to Polish democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, the authors of the admonition were former Solidarity activists, 
not the ruling coalition of former Communists who have never gotten along with 
the maverick president. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent poll by the Public Opinion Research Center in Warsaw, only 9% of 
Poles approved of Walesa's job performance. Even his backers were lukewarm 
about his future: Only a third of them said the president should seek 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Walesa's fairy-tale image has been muddied for some time. He first slipped 
from grace in 1990 when he turned on several Solidarity leaders -- including 
Mazowiecki -- who threatened to get in the way of his presidential ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 The messy affair splintered Solidarity, left all sides embittered and perhaps 
contributed to the current high-pitched assault on Walesa, the only declared 
candidate in next fall's presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
 But Walesa's immediate problems are more directly tied to his decisions to 
interfere in the running of Poland's independent broadcasting commission and 
the Defense Department, two areas in which his authority is not clearly defined 
in Poland's outdated constitution -- a document that he would like revised to 
enhance his powers. 
</P>
<P>
 Both television and the military could be key to Walesa's reelection chances, 
particularly if he is able to curry favor with the ever-popular army and 
attract positive TV coverage. So far, the strategy seems to be backfiring. 
</P>
<P>
 Walesa sacked two members of the broadcast commission, including its chairman, 
after the group awarded the country's first nationwide private TV license to a 
company not favored by Walesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The Polish ombudsman, an independent government watchdog, declared Walesa's 
action illegal, but the president has refused to back down. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Walesa asked Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk to resign after 
Walesa reportedly polled top generals about the pace of reforms in the army and 
found Kolodziejczyk wanting. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the prime minister has the authority to remove a Cabinet member. But 
Walesa, unhappy with his largely ceremonial role, interfered anyway. The result 
has been an embarrassing parliamentary inquiry into supposed insubordination by 
army top brass. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite growing political isolation, Walesa insists that he knows what is best 
for Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I deeply believe that it is not the letter of the law that serves people but 
the sense of this law," Walesa answered his critics in Parliament. "Nobody ever 
is going to turn me back on my way, by blackmail or by threats or by 
manipulation, even if I were to be completely on my own in Poland."

MEXICO FIGHTS PROP. 187 -- DELICATELY; POLITICS: THE GOVERNMENT IS SEEKING TO 
AVOID THE APPEARANCE OF INTERFERING IN THE AFFAIRS OF A NEIGHBORING STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Responding to nationalist outrage here over California's Proposition 187, the 
Mexican government is sponsoring a delicate but concerted campaign to defeat 
the state ballot measure without violating one of this nation's most cherished 
policies -- non-interference in other nations' internal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent interviews, Mexico's point man on the issue, Deputy Foreign 
Secretary Andres Rozental, has condemned the proposal to deny public services 
to undocumented aliens in California and confirmed the Mexican government's 
formal efforts to fight it. 
</P>
<P>
 But in defining Mexico's strategy to block an initiative that might affect 
hundreds of thousands of undocumented Mexicans in California, Rozental also 
described the tricky balancing act facing this nation, most affected by the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without interfering with the United States, the government of Mexico will 
work actively to prevent the passage of the anti-immigration initiative 187," 
he declared recently, responding to a torrent of emotional challenges to the 
California ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been assailed in Mexico City's media, has prompted thousands to take to 
the streets in capital protests and is to be the subject of large 
demonstrations planned this weekend in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 Rozental stopped short of detailing what, if any, money his government has 
devoted to the cause but made clear that Mexico is supporting groups in the 
United States working to defeat Prop. 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mexico will participate with organizations, associations and human rights 
groups to bring down this proposition," he said, adding: "We have media 
campaign strategies to inform the entire California electorate of the 
contributions that Mexicans have made and continue to make to this state, so 
that no one will go away with the idea that we are responsible for the costs 
and problems of the state." 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of Mexico's argument, Rozental and Mexico Foreign Secretary Manuel 
Tello agreed in separate interviews, is the belief here that Mexicans in 
California are being used as scapegoats for an economic crisis in California, 
unrelated to undocumented migrants. 
</P>
<P>
 And for a nation ill-prepared to offer those migrants a better life at home, 
the greatest concern here is that Prop. 187 will touch off what Tello this week 
called a "xenophobic wave that will spread into other American states along the 
frontier with Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such a backlash, say some Mexican and Latin American human rights groups 
fueling the government's anti-Prop. 187 crusade, would be disastrous for 
nations such as Mexico, where, they concede, the failure to deliver basic goods 
and human services ultimately is responsible for illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realize that in the last decades, for various and bitter circumstances 
that we won't analyze here, millions of women and men from our countries have 
abandoned their homes and land to immigrate to other latitudes where, with no 
more than strength to work, they could attain a life of dignity and a fair wage 
with which to give their children food, health, education and security," a 
Mexican-led human rights consortium declared in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 But the group, whose members come from more than a dozen Latin American 
countries, stressed in a blitz of recent, paid advertisements throughout Mexico 
that any proposal to push migrants out of California is no solution. 
</P>
<P>
 The group called Prop. 187 "an aggression against the human and worker rights 
of a labor force that historically has contributed to forging California." 
Group members demanded its withdrawal, asserting it "undermines the image of a 
country that claims to be the world's leading superpower, a vanguard of liberty 
and a paradigm of justice." 
</P>
<P>
 The group's alternative: "The status of the so-called 'undocumenteds' " must 
be resolved not unilaterally by America or any of its states but by an 
international forum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican government -- which often has condemned the United States for 
interfering in other nations' internal affairs -- has offered no alternatives 
to the problems identified by Prop. 187, instead taking pains to err on the 
side of caution. 
</P>
<P>
 But, amid a torrent of daily public condemnations of the California initiative 
in Mexico's nationalistic media, officials such as Rozental and others have 
spoken out against Prop. 187, saying it scapegoats a racial group. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico is not alone in its protest. Elsewhere in Central America, the home 
region to tens of thousands of illegal immigrants in California, governments 
and members of the public have been expressing outrage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gov. Pete Wilson is violating the human rights of California's immigrants," 
said the president of El Salvador, Armando Calderon Sol. "This is an affront to 
the dignity of man, woman and child. The very country founded on principles of 
liberty and human rights must repudiate this attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Like much of Central America, El Salvador's economy is kept afloat by money 
sent home by Salvadorans living in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Other public reaction to Prop. 187 in Mexico has been more conservative and 
measured. A recent editorial in the daily La Reforma stressed that the blame 
and the consequences behind the issue must be shared. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have lost generations and generations of Mexicans that valiantly have 
decided to abandon their homes and family to search and find a better solution 
for their lives," analyst Enrique Canales wrote. "The proof is that the great 
majority do not want to come back and prefer to establish themselves there." 
</P>
<P>
 Fineman, The Times' Mexico City bureau chief, is now on assignment in Haiti. 
Times staff writer Tracy Wilkinson in San Salvador contributed to this report.

FOR ARISTIDE, IT'S REALLY HOME AT LAST; HAITI: AFTER 2 WEEKS ON SOFA BED IN 
LOOTED PALACE, HE GOES TO RENOVATED VILLA FOR A LONG WEEKEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After an intense, two-week struggle to co-opt his enemies, consolidate his 
allies and begin rebuilding a nation in crisis, President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide on Friday did what he has been unable to do since his triumphant 
return to the Haitian capital two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He went home. 
</P>
<P>
 In an intricate U.S. military operation shrouded in secrecy, officials said 
Aristide left his heavily guarded downtown Presidential Palace for the first 
time since he returned from exile on Oct. 15, leaving behind the huge U.S. Army 
security detail -- and a convertible sofa that has been his bed for the last 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid continuing concerns for the president's safety -- from both assassins' 
bullets and adoring throngs -- a U.S. Army helicopter flew into the 
presidential compound an hour after a motorcade that included his bulletproof 
limousine had arrived. But the limousine was empty, a decoy after several days 
of rehearsal runs. It was the U.S. Army Blackhawk, with an attack helicopter 
escort, that took Aristide the few miles from a palace that had been looted 
down to its dirty carpeting by Haiti's departing military regime to his 
recently renovated suburban villa. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Aristide landed at a home now ringed by U.S.-manned machine-gun nests 
for what U.S. officials and aides said will be a five-day working weekend at 
home, it was clear that his toughest tasks still lay ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti still has no government and no Cabinet to begin the long process of 
administering justice and allocating the tens of millions of dollars in foreign 
aid now available for national reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's appointment of businessman and trusted aide Smarck Michel as prime 
minister has bogged down in debate in Haiti's often-contentious Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 No additional Cabinet ministers can be appointed until Michel's nomination is 
confirmed, and few political observers expect the vote until well into next 
week -- after Haiti celebrates its All Souls' Day and All Saints' Day holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats and political analysts nonetheless have praised Aristide for his 
cautious approach, his new-found presidential poise and his series of dramatic, 
conciliatory meetings with political allies and foes alike during his first two 
weeks in office. 
</P>
<P>
 But those analysts, Aristide's critics and even some key supporters said the 
honeymoon that has left the nation largely at peace and given the 
priest-turned-politician time to maneuver could soon come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is hope, but there is no time," said veteran Haitian human rights 
activist Jean-Claude Bajeux, who is deputy leader of one of the parties in the 
fractious pro-Aristide alliance dubbed Lavalas, which is Creole for "tidal 
wave." 
</P>
<P>
 "The most delicate problem now is to not further divide the Aristide family, 
and it's already divided into four groups. . . . There clearly is a risk they 
will eat one another and break the Lavalas family into bits. That is one of the 
great political problems now." 
</P>
<P>
 In a move to reunite the loose coalition that helped him win 67% of the 
popular vote during Haiti's last presidential elections four years ago, 
Aristide assembled all the pro-democracy parties for a marathon meeting at the 
palace on Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 But Aristide deliberately included at the meeting his political enemies as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 15 parties represented were right-wing political leaders who had 
supported the military coup that overthrew and forced Aristide into exile seven 
months after he took office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need an opposition to build a democracy," said one Aristide insider, who 
asked not to be named. "And to make sure it is an effective opposition, 
President Aristide also has to help them restructure themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the big job of Aristide right now is to make all those tendencies within 
Lavalas into a single political party -- before the parliamentary elections in 
December (1995)."  
</P>
<P>
 Human rights activist Bajeux was among the political leaders who attended 
Thursday morning's meeting. In an interview that afternoon, Bajeux outlined 
what he and other analysts and politicians see as the most urgent challenges 
facing Aristide in the days and weeks to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Bajeux said, they go beyond the crucial legislative elections still 
scheduled for late this year, an exercise Bajeux said would "drown" the 
president in political minutiae in the coming weeks and months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Justice and jobs," Bajeux said bluntly, echoing the popular priorities that 
have filled the capital's streets with mobs of job-seekers at the mere rumor 
that a factory was reopening or the U.S. forces were hiring this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Bajeux also gave Aristide high marks for his performance two weeks into a 
presidency that was restored with the aid of more than 16,000 U.S. combat 
troops that are still on the ground in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has found the right style. He's not the Aristide of before," Bajeux said. 
"He's behaving with a lot of command, a lot of poise. But now, we are waiting 
to see the people he will choose around him. That's the problem. And there is a 
lack of the competent people who are willing to take the risk to do this job." 
</P>
<P>
 One former Cabinet minister who served under Aristide before the coup said the 
president's top priority now is those appointments -- and restoring the 
confidence of Haiti's job-producing private sector. Aristide can only win over 
business, he said, by selecting highly qualified technocrats for key posts. 
</P>
<P>
 A key indicator of the potential for support awaiting Aristide in the 
traditionally conservative private sector was Thursday's vote for a new 
president of Haiti's Chamber of Commerce. The businessmen elected Maurice 
Lafortune, a pro-democracy moderate, and one businesswoman called the move "a 
sign the private sector wants to cut with the past." 
</P>
<P>
 But after three years of brutal military rule, Bajeux stressed justice over 
all other issues. Specifically, he said Aristide must quickly select several 
high-profile murders as the subject of public televised criminal trials -- 
chief among them the daylight machine-gun slaying last year of Haiti's last 
justice minister outside a Port-au-Prince church. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's aides said the president is considering the proposal as he 
continues to search for a qualified justice minister to assume the post and 
then create a civil judicial system that activists such as Bajeux say has been 
absent in Haiti for more than four decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Gladys Lauture, a close Aristide friend and longtime supporter, 
said she and a team of carpenters, plumbers and decorators spent 18 days making 
Aristide's Port-au-Prince home livable again. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the coup, she said, the Haitian military sacked it, looting 
every piece of furniture and every electrical wire and plumbing pipe, leaving 
only the bare walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she said, it is fully furnished and far better than his accommodation at 
the palace, where the military regime similarly took every stick of furniture, 
the Chinese porcelain, the wall paintings and even the toilets.

THAR'S GOLD IN THAT THAR LAVA . . . MAYBE

<P>
 Officials fear a rush of gold-hungry prospectors to a volcano in southern 
Colombia that a U.S. scientist claims is spewing a pound of gold each day. 
</P>
<P>
 About 45 pounds of gold from the Galeras Volcano become embedded in 
surrounding rock each year, according to the study by Fraser Goff of the Los 
Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Colombian expert claims that the volcano releases much less gold and in 
fragments so small that they are of no commercial value. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fear that when this gets out, all of Pasto will go running up the 
mountain," said Libaniel Casas, referring to the city of 350,000 at the base of 
the volcano. 
</P>
<P>
 Casas is director of the government mining and geology center in Narino state, 
where the volcano is located. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombian National Radio broadcast the U.S. study on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Pasto residents laughed at the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talk about an economic opening!" said Antonio Narino, a civil aviation 
official at the airport in Pasto. 
</P>
<P>
 He and other airport workers, standing on the tarmac and staring in wonder 
toward the cloud-covered volcano, said they were unaware of the volcano's 
golden bounty until a reporter told them about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Access to the volcano has been restricted since it erupted on Jan. 13, 1993, 
killing nine people, including six scientists taking samples from its crater. 
</P>
<P>
 Casas disputed Goff's figures, saying the volcano only released a pound of 
gold on days it erupted. "The volcano erupted five times in 1993," Casas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Bolanos, a spokesman for the governor's office in Narino state, said: 
"It's great news that the volcano is releasing gold, but it could also cause an 
invasion of people."

CLINTON VISITS ISRAEL'S HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL; TRIBUTE: THE PRESIDENT HELPS 
MARINES LAY A WREATH AT THE ETERNAL FLAME.

<P>
 President Clinton made his last stop in Israel on Friday with a visit to Yad 
Vashem, the somber hilltop memorial to the 6 million Jews who died in the 
Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by President Ezer Weizman, Clinton, looking pensive, stood inside 
the dimly lit Hall of Remembrance and listened to a children's choir sing the 
haunting "Eli, Eli" hymn, written by Hamma Senesh, an Israeli who died in 1944 
after she parachuted behind Nazi lines in Hungary and was captured by the 
Germans. 
</P>
<P>
 The President, wearing a traditional Jewish skullcap, bowed his head as a 
special memorial prayer was recited. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton helped two Marine honor guards lay a wreath at the eternal flame that 
burns in memory of the victims of Nazi genocide. He then paid a private visit 
to Yad Vashem's memorial to the children who died in the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerging from the children's memorial, Clinton walked to the sculpture of 
Januscz Korszacz, a Pole who saved thousands of children during World War II. 
The President signed Yad Vashem's guest book at a podium placed before the 
sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wrote that today we are one step closer to the time when the people of 
Israel can live together in peace with all of her neighbors, a time when never 
again will they suffer death and the events commemorated in this memorial here, 
simply because of their race and their faith. May God let it come to pass," 
Clinton replied when reporters asked what he had inscribed. 
</P>
<P>
 Summing up his visit to Israel, Clinton said: "It was a wonderful visit. I was 
deeply touched by the reception from the Israeli people, and I was grateful for 
the opportunity to address the Knesset. I will return to America ready to 
redouble my support and that of the American people, and I am determined to 
continue until there is a comprehensive peace."

FEDERAL JURY ORDERS LAS VEGAS HILTON TO PAY TAILHOOK FIGURE $1.7 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal jury found Friday that the Las Vegas Hilton failed to provide 
adequate security at the 1991 Tailhook convention, and ordered the hotel chain 
to pay whistle-blower Paula Coughlin $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin held her attorney's hand as the verdict was read.Her mother, sitting 
in the front row of the courtroom, wept. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury determined that the hotel and the Hilton corporation acted with 
malice, so the panel will return Monday to deliberate punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 In closing arguments Thursday, attorney Dennis Schoville contended that his 
client should receive $5 million to $10 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have lost the best of the best," Schoville said of Coughlin, a former Navy 
lieutenant and helicopter pilot who was once described as a "bright star" in a 
fitness report. 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin resigned from the Navy in February, citing pressure resulting from an 
alleged attack by her peers at the infamous 1991 convention of military 
aviators. 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin, 32, sued Hilton Hotel Corp. and the Las Vegas Hilton, site of the 
convention, claiming the resort failed to provide proper security. She also 
sued the San Diego-based Tailhook Assn., but settled out of court with that 
organization just days before the Hilton trial started. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 80 women claim they were sexually assaulted by drunken aviators at 
the convention, and a dozen have filed suit in state and federal court here. 
Coughlin's case is the most high-profile and was the first to go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin and other women claim they were groped and fondled by a gantlet of 
aviators on Sept. 7, the final night of the 1991 convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton attorney Eugene Wait did not deny that Coughlin was attacked, but said 
that, based on the 19 years of Tailhook conventions at the hotel, attacks were 
not foreseeable.

WOMAN HELD IN SLAYINGS OF HER THREE CHILDREN; CRIME: SUSPECT HAD TRIED TO BLAME 
KILLINGS ON ESTRANGED HUSBAND, BUT SAN JACINTO OFFICIALS SAY HE WAS IN LOS 
ANGELES.

<P>
 A 34-year-old woman who led police to the bodies of two of her slain children 
Thursday was arrested Friday on suspicion of killing them and her third child. 
Police Chief Nat Holmes said Dora Buenrostro appeared grim and was still trying 
to pin the murders on her estranged husband when she was arrested at 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes said Buenrostro, referring to her husband, asked incredulously, "Well, 
aren't you going to check things out?" 
</P>
<P>
 "We said, 'We did. We've been to L.A.,' " Holmes said. Investigators had 
already substantiated that Alejandro Buenrostro, who lives and works in Los 
Angeles, was leaving home for his job when his children were slain. 
</P>
<P>
 "She got quiet," Holmes said. "She looked grim." 
</P>
<P>
 Buenrostro, 34, was booked on three counts of murder in Riverside County Jail. 
She was held without bail on suspicion of using a sharp cutting instrument to 
kill Susana, 9, and Vicente, 8 -- whose bodies were found in her living room -- 
and Deidra, 4, whose body was found Thursday night. Youngsters discovered the 
younger girl's body strapped in a child's car seat in an abandoned building 
about 10 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Buenrostro may be arraigned as early as Monday, when the Riverside County 
coroner's office will conduct an autopsy on the three bodies. Riverside County 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Bentley said it is too soon to decide whether 
prosecutors would seek the death penalty, allowable in multiple-murder cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes said the two older victims appeared to have been killed shortly before 
the woman showed up at the small San Jacinto police station Thursday morning. 
She said that her husband was in her apartment and that she feared for her 
children's safety. When police returned to her two-bedroom garden apartment 
about half a mile away, they found the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators were less certain about the time of Deidra's death, he said. 
"She may have been killed many hours earlier, maybe 24 hours earlier," Holmes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Barry Backlund said the motive for the killings is unknown, but 
that a possible murder weapon was found. He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Backlund said the mother was arrested after making inconsistent statements to 
investigators. At first she said her husband showed up with a knife early 
Thursday at her apartment, but later said she never mentioned a knife, Backlund 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The woman "showed a minimum amount of emotion during the day," Backlund said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentley said the woman was "evasive and non-responsive," especially when asked 
to help locate the youngest child after she led police to the first two bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't respond to that line of questioning. And if you can put two and 
two together, you know what we were thinking -- that she already knew the baby 
was dead," Bentley said.

PRISON AGENCY IN CONTEMPT OF COURT

<P>
 A federal judge is holding the California Department of Corrections in 
contempt for failing to provide adequate mental health care at the medical 
prison at Vacaville, and has taken the initial steps toward fining the state 
$10,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ruling issued Thursday, U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton also 
appointed former prison administrator Alan Breed as a special master to oversee 
mental health care at Vacaville's California Medical Facility, the main prison 
for physically and mentally infirm inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Breed must refine a mental health plan within 120 days, and report to the 
judge on whether state officials are cooperating. The judge delayed the fines 
until he decides whether officials are implementing Breed's plan for treating 
the approximately 1,000 severely mentally ill inmates at the prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Breed, a court-appointed mediator in a class-action suit filed on behalf of 
inmates, wrote the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrections officials vowed to appeal.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; THE TIMES POLL; LUNGREN, DAVIS LEAD; BALLOT JOB TITLES 
MAY BE KEY TO OTHER RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Republican Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, who is seeking another term, and Democrat 
Gray Davis, who is running for lieutenant governor, continue to maintain 
commanding leads in their election drives, according to a Los Angeles Times 
Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 But five other so-called down ballot contests are much more in doubt, with 
evidence that the outcome of the Nov. 8 election could hinge largely on the way 
hopefuls describe themselves on the ballot, the poll results show. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats especially seem to register more support when likely voters are told 
what their job titles are as listed on the ballot.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, in the low-key contest for secretary of state, likely voters 
choosing between Democrat Tony Miller, who has never sought elective office, 
and Republican candidate Bill Jones of Fresno gave Jones a slim 37% to 32% 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when likely voters were told that Miller is identified on the ballot 
as "acting secretary of state" and Jones is described as "businessman, farmer, 
legislator," the positions were reversed and Miller outdistanced his opponent, 
44% to 31%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The titles do help some candidates, especially people without name 
recognition," said Susan Pinkus, assistant director of The Times Poll, adding 
that "acting secretary of state has helped Miller." Miller has spent the last 
18 years as legal counsel and top deputy to longtime Secretary of State March 
Fong Eu, who stepped down in February to become ambassador to Micronesia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Voters continue to tend to be undecided because of low name recognition, and 
ballot designation may be one of the ways in assisting them to make up their 
minds," Pinkus said. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar pattern is reflected in other races as candidates who are not 
household names begin to jab at one another in an onslaught of TV advertising 
intended to attract the attention of voters in the final days before the 
election. For the first time in years, incumbents are not seeking reelection in 
most of these statewide offices, which can serve as steppingstones to higher 
elective office. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey of 762 likely voters was conducted between Oct. 22 and Oct. 25, 
with the sample split roughly in half between those told of the official ballot 
designation and those to whom that information was not disclosed. The margin of 
error is 5 percentage points in either direction for each sample. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of the Davis and Lungren campaigns, the contests for these 
statewide offices tend to be tossups, Pinkus said.  
</P>
<P>
 The survey found that Lungren has built up his advantage over Assemblyman Tom 
Umberg (D-Garden Grove) among likely voters. Two weeks ago, the poll showed 
Lungren holding a 45% to 30% edge among those likely to cast ballots. In the 
latest poll, Lungren's advantage was stretched to a 53% to 30% margin. 
</P>
<P>
 When the candidates' titles were added, the numbers remain essentially 
unchanged. But the survey was completed the day Umberg began airing a dramatic 
TV spot in part blaming Lungren for contributing to the highly publicized 
slaying of 12-year-old Polly Klaas. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, too, maintains a large lead against his underfinanced opponent, state 
Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley), in their increasingly bitter fight to 
succeed Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy. The poll shows Wright still 
trailing by 21 percentage points. However, when likely voters are told that 
Davis is the state controller, his margin increases to 32 percentage points, 
leading Wright 58% to 26%. 
</P>
<P>
 In the contest to succeed Davis as controller, Republican Tom McClintock and 
Democrat Kathleen Connell were in a dead heat among likely voters in the last 
Times poll. 
</P>
<P>
 To distinguish himself from other candidates, McClintock, a former GOP 
assemblyman from Thousand Oaks, has been airing an offbeat ad with a narrator 
in a thick Scottish accent describing the candidate as the tightest skinflint 
around. Earlier in the campaign, McClintock went to court to successfully win 
the right to call himself "taxpayer advocate" on the ballot and in June easily 
won a contested primary to become the GOP standard bearer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest poll, McClintock clings to a narrow lead, 41% to 36%, among 
likely voters not told his ballot designation. However, when they stack up 
"taxpayer advocate" McClintock against Connell, described as "businesswoman, 
economist and educator," likely voters put Connell ahead by a 44% to 34% 
margin. Another 21% haven't made up their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballot titles also seem to influence the survey results in the state insurance 
commissioner's race to succeed outgoing John Garamendi, who lost a bid for the 
Democratic nomination for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 When voters were asked to choose between Democrat Art Torres or Republican 
Chuck Quackenbush, the contest is virtually even. But when Torres is described 
as a "California state senator" and Quackenbush a "small businessman and 
legislator," Torres ekes out a narrow 6 percentage point advantage among likely 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Something of a parallel approach is being taken by Maureen DiMarco, a Democrat 
who is stumping for the nonpartisan post of state schools chief. DiMarco, too, 
in TV spots is billing herself as a crime fighter as she slogs it out against 
fellow Democrat Delaine Eastin. 
</P>
<P>
 But among likely voters, 60% remain undecided between Eastin and DiMarco. 
Among those who have made up their minds Eastin held a 21% to 18% lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But when DiMarco, education adviser to Gov. Pete Wilson, was described as 
education Cabinet secretary and Eastin as a teacher and assemblywoman, DiMarco 
gained a small edge of 26% to 21%, with 53% still undecided. THE TIMES POLL: 
Many Races Remain Close 
</P>
<P>
 With less than two weeks left until Californians go to the polls to vote, most 
lower-profile state contests are still too close to call.

 Foes of Proposition 187, meanwhile, raised more than $600,000 in the first 
three weeks of October, pushing their total past $1.4 million -- more than 
twice what their rivals have raised. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Republican Party boosted the pro-Proposition 187 campaign with 
a contribution of $286,000, and another $428,000 to the anti-crime "three 
strikes" Proposition 184, campaign finance reports filed Friday show. 
</P>
<P>
 The money was spent on mass mailings of endorsements and absentee ballot 
applications to tens of thousands of Republican voters. The effort is aimed at 
helping Republican candidates who have been championing the measures in their 
bids to win state offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of the candidates are running on Yes on 187, and 184," state GOP 
chief Tirso del Junco said Friday. "You've got to do due diligence to advance 
the cause." 
</P>
<P>
 Political consultants trying to defeat Proposition 187 are spending much of 
their money on radio ads. Although they have raised more than their opposition, 
they remain far short of their goal of raising $3 million to $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had the initial goal of $3 million," said Joel Maliniak, spokesman for the 
No-on-187 campaign. "Will we reach it? Who knows? But every day, more people 
are announcing their opposition and are sending in their checks." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Teachers Assn., the largest public school union and one of the 
largest donors to state politics, gave $100,000 earlier this month to defeat 
Proposition 187, pushing its total to $443,000 during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187's backers are more than $400,000 in debt, and raised only 
$23,000 in addition to the contribution by the state Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 The season's richest initiative campaign is Proposition 188, backed by 
out-of-state cigarette manufacturers seeking to repeal tough anti-smoking laws 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco companies have spent more than $18 million to convince voters that 
Proposition 188 is a reasonable compromise between smokers and nonsmokers, 
including $10 million this month. Leading the charge is Philip Morris U.S.A, 
the nation's largest cigarette maker, which has pumped $12.5 million into the 
campaign, official finance reports show. 
</P>
<P>
 R J Reynolds, the tobacco subsidiary of R J R-Nabisco, has poured $3.4 million 
into the Yes-on-188 campaign. Other tobacco firms have spent more than $1.9 
million on the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco companies are spending millions to buy commercial time on radio 
and television stations, including cable systems. They have spent another 
$300,000 to buy endorsements on at least six slate mailers with such names as 
Your Pro-Choice Voter Guide and California Democratic Checklist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eighteen million? This is astounding," said Jack Nicholl, the consultant 
trying to defeat Proposition 188. "If there ever was a doubt that this was a 
David-Goliath campaign, there isn't now." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholl raised $308,000 in the first three weeks of October, for a total of 
$546,000. His biggest donors are the American Cancer Society, the American 
Heart Assn. and the American Lung Assn., each of which has given $100,000 or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 The donations enabled Proposition 188 opponents to air radio commercials in 
which former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop blasts the measure as a 
tobacco industry lie. 
</P>
<P>
 Another high-priced campaign involves Proposition 186, to scrap the current 
health care system and create a government-run system. Opponents raised $3 
million in the first three weeks of October, pushing their total to $8.8 
million. Several major insurance companies and hospital groups have given 
six-figure donations to kill the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of Proposition 186 raised $662,000 in the first three weeks of October 
-- almost all of it coming in donations of less than $1,000. The Yes on 186 
campaign has raised $2.5 million so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 185, which seeks to add a 4-cent per gallon tax to gasoline 
purchases to fund rail projects, is being opposed by oil companies. The 
opposition campaign has raised $686,000, with Chevron giving the most -- 
$150,000. Shell Oil has given $129,000. The proponents' contribution report was 
not available Friday.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; STATE TREASURER; CONFIDENT FONG AWAITS CAMPAIGN AD 
BARRAGE BY AGGRESSIVE ANGELIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With relaxed confidence, Matthew Fong leans back in his chair and jokes that 
he has two secret weapons in the state treasurer's race: his mother and O. J. 
Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 O. J. helps him because the famous defendant's murder trial will so capture 
voter interest that fewer people may pay attention to a last-minute barrage of 
anti-Fong television ads from his Democratic opponent, Phil Angelides. 
</P>
<P>
 "My strategy?," he quips. "I'm rooting for O. J. Simpson. . . . The more O. 
J.'s in the news, the better it is for me." 
</P>
<P>
 And Fong's mother helps because she is March Fong Eu, California's former 
secretary of state. Maybe, he says laughing, voters will associate his name 
with hers and not notice that they have different party affiliations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fong admits that the real test of his candidacy and of his chances to 
become the second Asian American ever elected to statewide office in California 
rests neither with his mother nor with Simpson. It depends on the effectiveness 
of his campaign in the final days before the election, when voters typically 
focus on down-ballot races. 
</P>
<P>
 His opponent, Angelides, a take-no-prisoners campaigner who beat former state 
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti in a ferocious Democratic primary 
battle, says he has the two things he needs to win again: the ability to raise 
mega-dollars for an effective media campaign and the moxie to run ads that go 
for the jugular. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will always speak hard truths," says Angelides. 
</P>
<P>
 In the primary, he aired an ad that strongly implied that Roberti, who opposes 
abortion, had condoned the murder of an abortion doctor in Florida. Critics 
were outraged, but the ad is credited with helping him win a lopsided victory 
over the longtime officeholder. 
</P>
<P>
 In the general election, Angelides is well positioned to give Fong the run of 
his political life. He has squirreled away $2.5 million for an advertising 
assault which he says will be a mixture of negative ads targeting Fong and 
positive spots designed to improve Angelides' name identification with voters. 
He does not rule out the possibility of another hit on abortion, an issue on 
which Fong refuses to take a position, contending that it is not relevant to 
the state treasurer's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong, who has put aside more than $1 million for his counteroffensive on the 
airwaves, acknowledges that he, too, is likely to resort to negative ads. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roberti has raised some things in his campaign dealing with my opponent's 
past and that, to me, is fair game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the election is over, the money spent by the two candidates will 
have been enough to run a governor's race in many states. Since election season 
began last year, Angelides has amassed $5.8 million; Fong, who skated through 
the primary without opposition, has collected $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the state treasurer's job has little to do with public 
policy-making, but the candidates promises rise to gubernatorial heights. They 
campaign on platforms of cutting state spending, erasing budget deficits and 
creating jobs -- no matter that there is little a treasurer could do to 
deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong travels the state hawking a plan for slashing state government spending 
by $2.2 billion that mirrors many of the reductions Gov. Pete Wilson has been 
pushing for years. Only when pressed does he acknowledge that the real power to 
cut spending rests with the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelides uses campaign and television appearances to promise that he will be 
the first state treasurer to say "no" to the governor and the Legislature if 
they come to him seeking financing for more debt. "It's the biggest hand that I 
have to play and I intend to play it forcefully and constructively," he says. 
However, he does not say exactly where he will draw the line on borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their expensive battle, Angelides and Fong have much in common. Nearly 
the same age -- Angelides is 41, Fong 40 -- both have strong ties to ethnic 
communities. Greek Americans have contributed heavily to Angelides while Asian 
Americans have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Fong. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong's introduction to politics came from his mother, who chose her son to run 
her third statewide campaign in 1982. In 1988, he moved out of her political 
footsteps and joined the Republican Party, saying he felt more comfortable with 
Republicans. "She was shocked," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelides' path in politics began in the Administration of former Gov. Edmund 
G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. and then took him to the Legislature, where he became 
chief of staff for former Assembly Majority Leader Michael Roos. 
</P>
<P>
 Both proved their party loyalty by taking top posts in presidential campaigns, 
Fong in George Bush's two races for President and Angelides in the campaigns of 
Michael Dukakis and Bill Clinton. Fong was rewarded with a 1991 appointment by 
Wilson to the Board of Equalization, the state agency that collects business 
taxes. That same year, Angelides rose to become state Democratic Party 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Both, too, built portfolios in the business and professional world. Fong 
started a export-import business and then worked for a law firm. Under the 
tutelage of a Sacramento land development powerhouse, Angelo K. Tskopoulos, 
Angelides made a fortune as a developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates also have liabilities that leave them open to attack. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, after assuming his seat on the Board of Equalization, Fong exercised 
his prerogative to move his office by selecting -- without bid -- a new site in 
the Crossroads Business Park in the City of Industry. After the state reached 
an agreement with Majestic Realty Co. to rent the property for him for $8,090 a 
month, he was given additional space, free of charge, by the company for his 
campaign office. His campaign reports show the value of the space over the 
years has amounted to about $50,000. Majestic has also donated $11,500 to his 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Fong and an official with the realty company insist there was no quid pro 
quo. Fong said he did not know he was going to be offered the free campaign 
space when he picked the office. "I know the appearance looks bad . . . (but) I 
have nothing to hide," he said. "I didn't see any problem accepting free 
(campaign) space after a third party (the state General Services Department) 
negotiated the cost of the lease." 
</P>
<P>
 To outdo Fong in fund-raising, Angelides, has amassed a debt of $2.3 million 
-- the very thing he has campaigned to prevent elected officials from doing. 
Most of his loans -- $1.5 million -- have come from his personal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelides' campaign has also received contributions and loans from Tskopoulos 
and his family totaling $303,412, an amount that critics contend makes him 
beholden to the millionaire developer. Angelides maintains that if he faces any 
conflict between his state duties and the interests of his longtime friend and 
mentor, "I will recuse myself instantly." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Angelides has received $10,000 in contributions from the Catellus 
Development Corp., a company in which the Public Employees Retirement System 
has a 41% interest. If elected treasurer, Angelides would sit on the retirement 
system's board and make judgments on the performance of Catellus' management. 
He insists the contribution will not influence his decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 As the campaigns race to the wire, both sides are expecting that their 
advertising will decide the election. Angelides figures the dollars he has to 
spend will lead to victory. Fong says his own ads will enable him to withstand 
the assault. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the O. J. factor in my favor, I don't think he can do it," he joked.

2 U.S. BORDER INSPECTORS HELD IN CORRUPTION PROBES; IMMIGRATION: CUSTOMS 
OFFICIAL IS ARRESTED AFTER 3 VANS WITH 68 PEOPLE INSIDE ARE STOPPED. INS AGENT 
ALLEGEDLY FORCED WOMEN TO HAVE SEX WITH HIM. 
</P>

<P>
 Exposing two cases of alleged corruption among U.S. border inspectors in the 
last two days, federal agents have arrested a customs inspector on suspicion of 
immigrant smuggling and an immigration inspector for investigation of 
smuggling, sexual abuse and bribery, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agents Friday arrested an Immigration and Naturalization Service 
inspector assigned to San Ysidro who allegedly pressured women crossing the 
border to have sex with him in exchange for returning confiscated documents, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. Customs Service inspector was arrested Thursday night after roving 
inspectors with a dog discovered three vans packed with a record 68 immigrants 
waiting to pass through his inspection lane at the San Ysidro port of entry. 
Investigators suspect the inspector was in league with the smugglers because 
the vans were spotted at his house this week by Border Patrol anti-smuggling 
agents, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case appears to bear out predictions that a Border Patrol crackdown 
launched here earlier this month would push smugglers into new strategies such 
as sneaking illegals through the legal port of entry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the smugglers are going to be challenging us at the port of entry 
and we are going to be up to the task," said U.S. Atty. Alan Bersin. 
</P>
<P>
 Both cases also show the potential for brazen misconduct among U.S. inspectors 
fighting the illegal flow of immigrants and drugs at the busiest border 
crossing in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, another INS inspector was charged with beating a 
border-crosser and filing a false report about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS and Customs Service share enforcement duties at ports of entry. At 
least two customs inspectors and five INS inspectors have been charged with 
crimes during the past five years, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guy Henry Kmett, 37, an eight-year veteran of the Customs Service, was 
arrested Thursday night in connection with the sophisticated smuggling ring, 
Bersin said, but the investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 The 68 illegal immigrants were packed into the three Ford vans intercepted 
south of Kmett's booth at the crowded international crossing about 6:15 a.m. 
The group of men, women and teen-agers included Central Americans, Mexicans, an 
Ecuadorean and an Egyptian.  
</P>
<P>
 The obviousness of the attempt raised suspicions immediately, officials said. 
Coincidentally, Border Patrol anti-smuggling agents working on a separate 
investigation this week had followed the same vans to Long Beach and to Kmett's 
house in Chula Vista. The agents determined Thursday through utility records 
that Kmett lived at the house, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to a federal source, authorities did not connect the two cases 
until an informant saw the seized vans on San Diego TV news Thursday afternoon 
and called a Border Patrol agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's arrest of INS Inspector Frederick L. Toothman resulted from an 
investigation by the U.S. Justice Department's Office of Inspector General. 
</P>
<P>
 Toothman, 49, allegedly preyed on at least seven female border-crossers who 
were sent to him after inspectors confiscated their documents as suspicious or 
fraudulent, authorities said. Toothman's job was to review such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 15, he allegedly told a Mexican woman that she would have to have sex 
with him to get her border-crossing card back. He drove her to a Chula Vista 
motel where they had sex, then returned the card and let her stay in the United 
States, the complaint said.

 A man charged with impersonating his twin in order to have sex with the 
brother's girlfriend was cleared by a jury that deliberated just five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamont Hough, 24, of Roosevelt, N.Y., was found not guilty Thursday of 
criminal impersonation. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman had said she called police when she realized that the man she had 
had sex with was not her boyfriend. But defense attorney Peter Borgiorno said 
the jury of five women and one man did not believe the woman was fooled.

NORTH DISCOUNTS MRS. REAGAN'S CHARGE THAT HE LIED TO PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nancy Reagan says Virginia Senate candidate Oliver L. North lied to her 
husband, but North refused Friday to take up the gauntlet, saying he wouldn't 
"fight with a lady." 
</P>
<P>
 North spoke the morning after former President Ronald Reagan's wife became the 
latest in a string of former associates to question North's truthfulness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know Ollie North has a great deal of trouble separating fact from fantasy. 
And he lied to my husband and lied about my husband, kept things from him that 
he should not have kept from him," the former First Lady said Thursday in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 North predicted that her remarks would have no effect on his race against 
Democratic Sen. Charles S. Robb and independent J. Marshall Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother told me a long time ago never to get into a fight with a lady," 
North said. 
</P>
<P>
 North said the records of President Clinton and Robb are more important issues 
than his participation as a Reagan White House aide in the Iran-Contra 
arms-for-hostages scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any of this stuff is going to hurt me," he said at a news 
conference in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference in Bristol, Va., Robb said Nancy Reagan's comments about 
North are consistent with the views of others in the military and in the Reagan 
Administration who knew him. "Most people who have worked for her husband took 
a very strong position in opposition to his candidacy," Robb said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his book, "Under Fire," and in subsequent interviews, North has said Reagan 
knew about the secret operation to funnel money from arms sales to Iran to the 
Nicaraguan Contras.  
</P>
<P>
 Reagan fired North when Justice Department lawyers discovered North's 
diversion of arms-sale proceeds. North was convicted in 1989 of three felony 
counts in the scandal. The convictions were overturned because a judge ruled 
his trial was tainted by testimony North gave previously to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, when North was seeking the GOP Senate nomination, Reagan said he was 
"getting pretty steamed" about North's statements. "I never instructed him or 
anyone in my Administration to mislead Congress on Iran-Contra matters or 
anything else," Reagan said.

MARYLAND U. TO APPEAL RULING ON SCHOLARSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The University of Maryland will go to the U.S. Supreme Court to appeal a court 
ruling that would effectively eliminate a scholarship program for black 
students at the university, a spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our intent is to appeal to the Supreme Court, which is our only recourse," 
said Roland King, director of the office of public information at the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something the university feels very strongly about because the 
scholarship has been very effective in addressing under-representation of 
African Americans at the University of Maryland," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The NAACP Legal Defense Fund also condemned the ruling, calling it an assault 
on the nation's commitment to diversity and equal opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, the fund said: "At a time when we should be encouraging 
African American youth to live up to their potential and seek higher education, 
the court's decision instead serves to stifle hope that African Americans can 
participate fully and fairly in American society." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday denied the university's 
motion for rejudgment against Daniel Podberesky, a Latino student who is 
seeking $35,000 in scholarship money he believes he was denied because he was 
not black. 
</P>
<P>
 Podberesky, who filed his suit four years ago, was graduated in May and is now 
a medical student at the university. Podberesky could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The original ruling was in favor of the university, but Podberesky appealed 
and received a favorable ruling.

N.Y. $70-MILLION LOTTERY PRIZE SETS OFF TICKET-BUYING SPREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hope springs eternal -- even in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of people lined up at grocery stores and candy shops Friday as 
natives and tourists alike went on a lottery ticket-buying spree for a chance 
at winning $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's possible the figure could go higher by Saturday," lottery spokesman Bill 
Knowlton said. "This is new territory. We apply our formula against trends, but 
this drawing is a trend-buster. We've never been this high before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 By noon Friday, more than 21 million tickets -- at $1 apiece -- had been sold, 
a rate of about 13,000 tickets a minute, Knowlton said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 25,827,165 possible combinations of six figures, lottery officials 
said. The odds of one ticket having all six numbers correctly are 1 in 12.9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 There was one New York State Lotto drawing that was larger than today's 
jackpot, but that $90-million prize, shared by nine players in 1991, was a 
special drawing financed in part by a onetime $50-million legislative 
appropriation to spur ticket sales, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the chances of winning may seem insurmountable, it didn't stop bettors 
from pursuing their dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Retired salesman Irving Kahn, 84, was optimistic he'd finally be a winner. 
"After all this time, it's my turn to win," he said, putting down $10 for a 
chance to become a millionaire.

EX-REBEL CALLS OFF BOYCOTT OF MOZAMBIQUE VOTE

<P>
 The former rebel leader in this African nation called off a failed boycott of 
Mozambique's first multi-party election Friday and then voted with a broad 
smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials added an extra day of voting today to the scheduled two-day election 
amid optimism that this impoverished, war-torn country had surmounted one more 
hurdle in its quest for democracy and peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting continued peacefully Friday, with only a few polling stations in the 
central and northern provinces reporting delays. Election officials said half 
the 6.3 million registered voters had cast ballots Thursday, the first day of 
voting. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N.-arranged vote is Mozambique's first free election since the leftist 
Mozambique Liberation Front, or Frelimo, took over after independence from 
Portugal in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil war broke out in 1977 between Frelimo and the rebel Mozambique National 
Resistance, or Renamo. About 600,000 people died in war, famine and disease, 
and the economy was wrecked before a peace pact was signed in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Renamo and Frelimo are expected to win almost all of the 250 Parliament seats. 
President Joaquim Chissano of Frelimo was favored to win the presidency and 
indicated that he would give Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama a government post. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. and Western officials rushed to save the 2-year-old peace process after 
Renamo announced hours before polls opened Thursday that it would boycott the 
vote to protest alleged irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday morning, Dhlakama, flanked by U.N. special envoy Aldo Ajello, 
announced that Renamo would participate and accept any result judged free and 
fair by the international community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my victory to have the election in Mozambique," he said in a Maputo 
polling station crowded with reporters and U.N. election observers. He lowered 
his folded ballot slowly into the box, smiling for photographers.

VASQUEZ UNDER FIRE FOR SILENCE ON PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, Orange County's highest-ranking elected Latino 
official, says he has no intention of getting pulled into the battle over 
Proposition 187, a position that is drawing criticism from both sides of the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't taken a conclusive position on that," Vasquez said this week. "I 
don't intend to get involved in the campaign for either side."  
</P>
<P>
 The controversial initiative seeks to withhold social benefits and public 
education from illegal immigrants. The measure would also require education, 
health and law enforcement officials to contact federal authorities when they 
suspect someone is in the country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that some elected officials feel that this issue doesn't 
need to be responded to," said Robert Kiley, the political strategist for the 
Save-Our-State committee. "I think every elected official should stand up and 
tell their constituents where they stand. It's a very clear. There should be no 
fence riding." 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Montez, a spokesman for the League of United Latin American Citizens, 
chided Vasquez for not having the "courage" to take a public stance on an 
issue, which is so important to the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gaddi Vasquez is the highest-ranking Latino in the county and he's used it to 
propel his political career here and on the national level," Montez said. "But 
obviously he feels he is on the right side on the street, the safe side, and he 
wishes to become a spectator just like the good Germans did when they watched 
other Germans being marched to the ovens." Among Vasquez' colleagues, 
Supervisors Roger R. Stanton and William G. Steiner say they support the 
measure. Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said she opposes it. Board Chairman 
Thomas F. Riley could not be reached for comment Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposition has sparked an emotional debate among most segments of 
society. The Latino community is no exception. According to a recent poll by 
The Times, the measure is opposed by registered Latino voters 65% to 22%. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Vasquez said he has not made up his mind about the measure. He said 
he has not been contacted by any groups on either side to endorse or oppose the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 At the age 39, Vasquez, a former police officer, is a seasoned politician and 
viewed by many as the most prominent Latino in elected office in Orange County. 
Gov. George Deukmejian appointed him to the board in 1987, and he was elected 
to a four-year term in 1992. Vasquez represents the 3rd District, which is 
about 15% Latino. The sprawling district includes Fullerton, Orange, Brea, La 
Habra, Yorba Linda, Mission Viejo and Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people involved in the campaign are surprised that Vasquez has been 
silent. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Proposition 187 is the hottest button that has been pushed in California 
since Prop. 13 and I think every official should show his colors on it," said 
Bill King, one of local backers of the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez's refusal to take a stand can be boiled down to "one word -- fear," 
King said. "Fear of the loss of his political position. I don't think he has 
shown much courage. These people should be standing up one way or the other. 
This is not time to hiding around the skirts of 'no comment.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Amin David, chairman of Los Amigos of Orange County -- a countywide Latino 
activist organization, said he believes all elected officials should let their 
constituents know where they stand on the issue, but contends that Latino 
leaders bear a greater responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clear the proposition is directed at Latinos," David said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would respect Vasquez more if he took a stand supporting the 
measure than taking no position. "I think that would be full of honesty and I 
think our community deserves it." 
</P>
<P>
 David said time is running out for Vasquez to take a stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will take note of the Johnny-come-latelys and Gaddi-come-latelys," he 
said. "We are very sensitive that now is the time to speak and now is the time 
to act." 
</P>
<P>
 John Palacio, of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, also 
called for Vasquez to take a stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most significant ballot measure to impact the Latino community 
this decade," Palacio said. "Orange County is one place that is greatly 
impacted by the proposition. It was born in Orange County, the anti-immigration 
movement is from Orange County. It would seem to me leadership requires all 
elected officials to take a position."

GOP DUO HAIL PROP. 187 AS STATE'S FISCAL SAVIOR; IMMIGRATION: AT ANAHEIM RALLY, 
ROHRABACHER AND DANNEMEYER CONTEND THAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS JEOPARDIZING 
CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE. 
</P>

<P>
 To counter what they called an onslaught of "negative propaganda," an Orange 
County congressman and a former congressman hailed Proposition 187 at a 
fund-raiser Friday night as the state's last best hope of saving itself from 
financial ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) and William Dannemeyer, a former 
seven-term Republican congressman from Fullerton, argued that supplying 
education, medical and welfare benefits to illegal immigrants is bankrupting 
the state and jeopardizing the future of the entire nation. Proposition 187 
would prohibit illegal immigrants from receiving such public services. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this doesn't pass, the flood of illegal immigrants will turn into a tidal 
wave, and a huge neon sign will be lit up above the state of California that 
reads: 'Come and get it.' " Rohrabacher told a cheering and flag-waving crowd 
of about 100 initiative supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state is in technical receivership," Dannemeyer said. "The people of this 
state are sick and tired of having laws being crushed under the feet of illegal 
aliens." 
</P>
<P>
 Both men attacked arguments that the initiative will abet an anti-immigrant, 
even racist, climate in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "The charge of racism is a tactic of intimidation that doesn't work anymore," 
Rohrabacher said. "It's meant to close out honest debate. This initiative isn't 
about racism. It's about whether foreigners should be coming here depleting the 
scarce resources of Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 The speakers praised the United States for being a diverse nation that was 
founded by immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer responded to former Republican Cabinet Secretaries Jack F. Kemp and 
William J. Bennett who last week condemned the measure, saying it would force 
teachers and nurses to function as immigration agents. Dannemeyer said school 
officials could easily check citizenship status with birth certificates already 
on file. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers, who charged $20 to attend the event at the Phoenix Club, a 
German-heritage club, said money raised Friday night would help pay for 
television and radio ads in support of Proposition 187 in the next week.

TAX APPEALS FLAP DRAWS IRE OF SUPERVISORS; BUREAUCRACY: STEINER SAYS THAT CLERK 
OF THE BOARD PHYLLIS A. HENDERSON AND POSSIBLY OTHERS SHOULD RESIGN. CLERK 
DISPUTES ASSESSOR'S PINNING BLAME ON HER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Fallout from the mishandling of more than 170 property assessment appeals 
continued Friday, with some county supervisors considering asking Clerk of the 
Board Phyllis A. Henderson to resign, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lost confidence in her office," said Supervisor William G. Steiner. 
"I've suggested that maybe she consider resigning." 
</P>
<P>
 But Steiner added that he thought "there are a whole cast of characters who 
are responsible, and I don't necessarily want her to be a sacrificial lamb when 
others have responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the finger-pointing on the appeals blunder escalated, with 
Henderson disputing comments from Assessor Bradley L. Jacobs that she was to 
blame for allowing the two-year deadline on appeals to expire. The snafu could 
end up costing the county millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the discovery of the problem last week, county officials have set about 
to correct the situation and determine who is responsible. A preliminary review 
of the appeals process seems to indicate that the system is severely flawed, 
county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said Orange County is apparently the only county in California 
that requires property owners to file appeals of their tax bills with the 
assessor, instead of the clerk of the board. The practice raises potential 
conflict-of-interest issues and may be a violation of state law, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Jacobs said he had asked Henderson at least half a dozen times 
over the past several years to take over the process of receiving the appeals. 
He said that, even though the clerk is responsible for tracking the deadlines 
on the appeals, he used to send her warning notices and status reports to alert 
her when deadlines were approaching. Jacobs said he stopped sending Henderson 
those notices in July after she requested that he stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson said Friday that she never requested that Jacobs stop sending those 
alerts, nor did the assessor ever ask her to take over the process of receiving 
the appeals. In a statement released from her office, Henderson said that, ever 
since she was appointed to her position in 1992, Jacobs has never returned her 
phone calls and she has never been able to meet with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the mistake on the 179 appeal cases, Henderson has disciplined one of 
her employees, whom she refused to identify. County sources said Friday the 
employee is her top assistant, Nancy K. Swanson. Henderson would only say that 
Swanson, who was responsible for the appeals, will no longer handle that job. 
</P>
<P>
 Swanson declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The bickering between the county departments has frustrated some county 
supervisors. The board is apparently looking into revoking recent raises given 
to Henderson and Jacobs. Several of the supervisors have suggested that 
additional disciplinary actions and resignations may be in order. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson was appointed to her position and is accountable to the Board of 
Supervisors. Her duties include handling the agendas and records for the Board 
of Supervisors, as well as being the supervising clerk for the Assessment 
Appeals Board. Jacobs is an elected official and does not report to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is embarrassing," said Supervisor Roger R. Stanton about the appeals mess. 
He said he would like to "pin down the responsibility. Maybe it's shared 
guilt."  
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said he has not asked for Henderson's resignation. But, he said, "I'd 
be the last person to talk somebody out of offering their resignation. . . . I 
still want to hear from both sides of the story. . . . If she resigns, she 
resigns, but we still have to contend with Brad Jacobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said he has grave concerns about the clerk's office. He said that not 
only does he think Henderson should consider resigning, but that Swanson might 
also think about doing so.  
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said she is waiting to learn more about the 
foul-up and who is responsible before deciding what type of board action may be 
necessary. She said some of her colleagues may be "shooting from the hip and 
looking for a scapegoat." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Gaddi H. Vasquez and Thomas F. Riley could not be reached for 
comment.

COSTA MESA GIRL FATALLY SHOT; FATHER HELD AS MURDER SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 15-year-old girl died after being shot in the neck at her home, and police 
said Friday that even though the shooting might have been accidental, her 
father had been jailed on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the father, David Curtis Stinson, called them to the scene shortly 
after the shooting at their apartment Thursday night in the 3100 block of Coral 
Avenue. They said he apparently "shot the girl while he was cleaning or 
checking (a) gun" as the two talked in his room. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no apparent motive for the shooting," said a Costa Mesa police 
spokesman, who added that the 39-year-old warehouse supervisor had been 
drinking before the incident. Stinson was booked on suspicion of murder and was 
being held Friday in lieu of posting $250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Police would not identify the shooting victim by name, but two teen-agers who 
were present when the shooting occurred said the girl was Stinson's 15-year-old 
daughter, Callaster Natis Stinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Erica Garcia, 17, said she and Ray Kraskey, 18, had been listening to "hip-hop 
rap" music with Natis, as she was called by her friends, when Stinson returned 
home shortly before 9 p.m. Thursday. She said he appeared to be unsteady on his 
feet and his speech was slurred as if he had been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Kraskey said that shortly after his return home, the father went into his 
bedroom and called for his daughter. "He called her in, and then BOOM," said 
Kraskey, who was tearful Friday as he recalled the events leading to his 
friend's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said that after the shooting, the father repeatedly tried to dial 911 
on his cordless phone but couldn't get it to work. Garcia said she ran next 
door and called for help on a neighbor's phone. The neighbor, who is a nurse, 
tried unsuccessfully to revive the girl before she was rushed to Hoag Memorial 
Hospital Presbyterian, where she was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said she could not believe that the shooting was intentional. "I don't 
think he would deliberately kill her. He never even yelled at her," Garcia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the father's friends described him as a hard-working man who, after 
divorcing his wife, had fought in court to win custody of his daughter, arguing 
that the girl was not being raised properly. 
</P>
<P>
 In court documents, Stinson claimed that the girl, then 9 years old, was 20 
pounds underweight and had been forced to scrape mold off of bread scraps to 
have something to eat. Tom Staples, 51, who said he was the father's roommate 
in 1988 when he got custody of the girl, said Stinson "rescued" the child, who 
had been living in an abandoned bus in Riverside County with her mother, 
Suzanne Patricia Stinson. 
</P>
<P>
 But Suzanne Stinson questioned the father's parental fitness, accusing him in 
court documents of excessive drinking. "He would spend time at the bar every 
day after work and would spend more money than we could afford there," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Block, Erica Garcia's mother, said neighbors had taken Natis "under 
their wing" once she was awarded to the father, who was known as a good cook -- 
prized for the homemade chicken pot pies he served to neighbors he invited to 
his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Mimi Birch, an assistant principal at Estancia High School, where Natis was a 
sophomore, described her as "a very bright girl who just couldn't make herself 
come to school." Christine Cullen, Natis' counselor, said the girl had showed 
up for school no more than a day or two last semester. 
</P>
<P>
 In her neighborhood, Natis was mourned Friday as a good friend and a trusted 
baby-sitter loved by neighborhood children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cared deeply for Natis. She was very nice, funny, good with children. All 
the kids loved her," said Sarah Thomas, who on Friday was trying to figure out 
how to break tell her 6-year-old son that Natis was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a tragedy," Thomas added. "We know her dad did love her. It shows how 
dangerous it is to have firearms in your home." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said they will have a car wash today and Sunday at the Mesa Verde 
Shell station at 3131 Harbor Blvd. to try to raise money to pay for the 
funeral.

POLICE KILL HOSPITAL GUNMAN; CRIME: HE APPARENTLY WAS TRYING TO ESCAPE AREA 
WHEN HE FIRED AT AND MISSED AN OFFICER. A MOTORIST WHOSE CAR HE JUMPED IN IS 
WOUNDED IN THE SHOOTOUT.

<P>
 A man who waved a gun in a hospital parking lot and then opened fire on an 
officer was shot and killed by police at a busy intersection Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that at about 1 p.m., employees at Fountain Valley Regional 
Hospital and Medical Center reported a man standing outside waving, pointing a 
gun and threatening people in the lobby of an office building in the 11100 
block of Warner Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, later identified as 20-year-old Anthony Rios of Santa Ana, then ran 
across the street, police said. As cars were stopped at a red light at Warner 
and Euclid Street, Rios got into a Nissan Sentra stopped in the right lane. 
Police Friday night still did not know if the gunman knew the driver or just 
picked the car at random. 
</P>
<P>
 At that moment, two Fountain Valley officers and a third from Santa Ana 
blocked the Nissan at the intersection and ordered Rios to drop the gun, Lt. 
Bob Moseley of Fountain Valley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he got out of the car, "went to the rear of the vehicle and got into 
a shooting position and shot at an officer several times," Moseley said. "He 
fired at least three rounds before the officers returned fire."  
</P>
<P>
 Rios was killed and the Nissan driver was hit by several police bullets, 
police said. The driver was in stable condition Friday night after major chest 
surgery. None of the officers was hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses at a gas station across the street said it happened quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The red Nissan came up and stopped at the red light. There were no lights, no 
sirens," said Roch Courreges, the station manager. "The guy took three shots at 
(the officer) and the cop returned fire. It just happened boom, boom, boom. 
(The gunman) got hit right in the chest. I was just hoping the guy wouldn't 
come over here. . . . The officer was lucky the guy was a bad shot. He was just 
standing there." 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Woods, a station attendant, gave a similar account. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cops told him to throw down his weapon," Woods said. "The passenger 
jumped out and tried to shoot at the cop. There were all these bullets flying 
around. The cop was standing on the grass facing the passenger. He crouched and 
started shooting at the cop. It was crazy."  
</P>
<P>
 Louise Wilson was driving home with her 5-year-old son only a few lanes from 
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so frightening for us. We couldn't defend ourselves," she said. "All 
we could do was hide underneath our dashboard. I was scared one of the shots 
was going to get us. . . ." Wilson said that, despite the officers' orders, the 
driver of the Nissan "would not get down. He kept sitting up. Afterward, the 
policeman was yelling for the driver to get out so he crawled out and he had 
blood on his shirt." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was afraid the policeman was going to get killed because he had no cover 
whatsoever," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials did not identify the officer who was shot at, saying only that he is 
a veteran on the force and an outstanding officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good Lord was protecting him," Moseley said. "It's absolutely a miracle 
the officer was not hit."  
</P>
<P>
 Rios had been acting strangely for the past few days and might have been 
suffering delusions, relatives told police.  
</P>
<P>
 "That is the picture that is beginning to emerge," Fountain Valley Police 
Capt. Bill De Nisi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they believe that Rios went to visit a relative who works in the 
office building, which is on the medical center campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Helicopters hovered over the scene, where red and yellow police tape marked 
off surrounding blocks, dozens of witnesses gave statements and teams from two 
police departments and the district attorney's office gathered. As in all cases 
of officer-involved shootings, the Orange County district attorney will handle 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second fatal, officer-involved shooting in Fountain Valley this 
year. In the earlier case, the district attorney's office filed no charges 
against the officer.

 Cal Lutheran University celebrates its 30th anniversary today, with plans for 
homecoming festivities ranging from a parade in Thousand Oaks to a nostalgic 
gathering of alumni on the set of the old television show "Gunsmoke." 
</P>
<P>
 The parade begins at 11 a.m. and proceeds down Memorial Parkway to Kingsmen 
Park for a picnic at 11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1 p.m., the Cal Lutheran Kingsmen face off against the Pomona-Pitzer 
football team. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, alumni from all classes are scheduled to gather for a 
homecoming party featuring hayrides, food, dancing and music. The post-game 
party begins at 4:30 p.m. at the Cal Lutheran stables, north of Olsen Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme is "Return to Dodge City" because the old television show "Gunsmoke" 
was filmed in the Wildwood development near the campus. The old set will be 
re-created at the stables for the party. 
</P>
<P>
 Reunions for the classes of 1964-65, 1969, 1974, 1984 and 1989 will be held at 
the homes of alumni and faculty at 8:30 p.m. Information: the University 
Relations office at 493-3151. MARY F. POLS

 Voters take note: City Council candidates Leland C. Wilson, Bahia E. Wilson, 
Michael J. Wagner and Dick Logemann don't want you to vote for them. 
</P>
<P>
 The four candidates, whose names will appear on the Nov. 8 ballot, have 
dropped out of the race, leaving a field of 11 candidates, who are seeking two 
seats on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Bahia E. Wilson said she wants her supporters to vote for Gary Nouskajian, 43, 
and Councilwoman Jan M. Flory, 50. 
</P>
<P>
 Leland C. Wilson is throwing his support behind former Councilman Don 
Bankhead, 62, who recently was recalled from office, Bob McNutt, 50, and Flory. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner said he decided to drop out of the race to urge his supporters to vote 
for Nouskajian. 
</P>
<P>
 Logemann, who hasn't endorsed any of the candidates still in the race, said he 
dropped out months ago, soon after filing papers to run for City Council. "I'm 
not quite sure why I entered the race in the first place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leland C. Wilson and Wagner said they don't believe they could win election 
and would rather push for candidates who are not endorsed by the Fullerton 
Recalls Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important to try to make sure a recall member or two doesn't get 
on the council," Leland C. Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 One has already been elected. Conrad DeWitte, who is seeking reelection, won a 
seat in the special recall election earlier this month. DeWitte and his running 
mate, Jack Dean, 46, both have pledged to repeal the controversial utility tax, 
whose passage led to the recall of three council members in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates still in the race are: Michael J. Mummert, 35; Edith 
O'Donnell, 65; Stuart Stitch, 25; James J. Tanaka, 37, and Carole E. Wink, 55.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; STRIPTEASE SALES PITCH UPSETS CITY OFFICIALS 
</P>

<P>
 A music store's decision to have a striptease contest to promote a sale today 
has angered city officials and has left the store defending itself against 
complaints it is being sexist just to make a buck. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very tongue-in-cheek event," said Brian Regan, a spokesman for 
Virgin Megastore, which is holding the event in Triangle Square."We're not 
promoting or encouraging anything outside the parameters of the community. And 
both men and women are going to be in the contest, so we're not being sexist." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sexes 18 and older will strip down to bathing suits starting at 10 a.m. 
to help promote musical and video products inside the store. But some city 
officials have taken offense to the "Take It All Off, Strip Down Sale" sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a touchy issue and we're concerned," Councilman Peter F. Buffa said. 
"We're not looking to have this kind of precedent established in the city. 
Costa Mesa is a pretty conservative city to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
 But Regan said the sale is just for fun, and that the striptease will not 
involve any nudity. The event will feature Penthouse Pet Seana Ryan, who will 
serve on the panel of judges and will pose for photographs with customers who 
buy a copy of the "Party with the Pets" home video. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Sandra L. Genis expressed disappointment at the store for having such a 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows how far we've come, that men can be meaningless sex objects too," 
she said. " I would hope we would be beyond that thing. Holding a striptease as 
a record-video promotion is very tacky, it exploits a part of our nature that 
would probably be better off left unexploited." TOM RAGAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; L.A. MAN SENTENCED TO LIFE IN COMPUTER 
STORE SLAYING

<P>
 A 21-year-old Los Angeles man was sentenced to life in prison without parole 
for killing a woman who happened upon an armed robbery in 1991 at a Fountain 
Valley computer store. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing an emotional letter from the dead woman's son, Orange County 
Superior Court Judge Jean Rheinheimer said society should not become so inured 
to violent crimes that the victim's suffering is forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 "The terror must be real and there when you have a gun shoved in your face and 
know you may have your brains blown away the next moment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Lee, an executive secretary at Hughes Aircraft in El Segundo and a 
mother of two, was shot in the head in the parking lot of Comp USA when she 
came to pick up her teen-age son who worked at the store. Prosecutors believe, 
according to court documents, that Lee was shot point-blank, "execution-style," 
by Nokkuwa (Pretty Boy) Ervin when he spotted her walking toward the building. 
She had surprised him and two cohorts who were robbing the store. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees inside the store, including Lee's younger son who was 18 at the 
time, had been gagged and handcuffed to a restroom rail, but were not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's older son, Joseph Lee of Memphis, Tenn., had asked the judge for the 
maximum sentence in a letter read in court by the dead woman's best friend, 
Laura Luft. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother and I had a relationship that was not only that of mother and son, 
but also the best of friends," the letter read in part. "Now all I have left of 
my mother are memories, and that's all I will ever have. . . . The night 
Nokkuwa Ervin took my mother's life, he also took a part of mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Ervin's attorney said he plans to appeal.  
</P>
<P>
 Ervin was the second defendant in the case to receive a life term. A third 
defendant, William Clark, is awaiting trial. He is charged with Lee's murder 
and with ordering the killing of a prime witness in the Lee case. Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Rick King announced Friday that he plans to seek the death penalty for 
Clark. SUSAN MARQUEZ OWEN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; NAVAL WEAPONS STATION TO WELCOME PUBLIC TODAY 
</P>

<P>
 An estimated 2,000 people are expected to take advantage of a rare public 
invitation today to pass through the gates of the Seal Beach Naval Weapons 
Station for a glimpse inside the 5,000-acre base. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all part of a 50th-anniversary celebration that will culminate Wednesday 
with a visit by U.S. Navy Secretary John H. Dalton, who is scheduled to take 
part in an invitation-only cake-cutting ceremony with community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here to demystify what's going on here at the station," said base Cmdr. 
Joel F. Steadley, 41, a former Navy salvage diver who came to the weapons 
station seven months ago from a Pentagon assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're an engineering facility, a maintenance facility and a warehousing 
facility," he said. "There's nothing evil or wicked that goes on here behind 
these fences." 
</P>
<P>
 The Seal Beach Naval Ammunition and Net Depot opened Nov. 2, 1944, with the 
primary mission of storing ammunition and repairing steel anti-submarine nets 
used to block Japanese submarines from entering U.S. harbors. 
</P>
<P>
 The weapons station now maintains most of the Navy's surface-to-air missiles 
and is a supply depot for ammunition ranging from hand grenades to 100-pound 
shells for Navy warships. The Seal Beach Weapons Station is also the only Naval 
base on the West Coast that loads Tomahawk surface-to-surface missiles onto 
warships. 
</P>
<P>
 Tours through ammunition storage and missile maintenance buildings will be 
offered from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. today. Tours will also include part of the 
1,000-acre Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge inside base grounds and the USS 
Denver, which is docked at the station's loading wharf. RUSS LOAR

<P>
 Motorcyclists are invited to join a convoy carrying toys and donations Sunday 
to a home for abused and neglected children in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefit is expected to draw more than 300 motorcyclists, said Pete Linton, 
an Irvine police investigator who heads the event. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to gathering toys for the Orangewood Children's Home, the ride 
will honor Tom and Marcy Smith, an Irvine couple killed last summer riding on 
the Oregon-Washington border. 
</P>
<P>
 The event -- sponsored by a chapter of the Gold Wing Road Riders Assn. and the 
Irvine Police Assn. -- is open to all makes of motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
 Riders should bring a $1 donation and a toy gift for the children, who range 
in age from infants to teen-agers.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; $6-MILLION, 16-MILE TRAIL SYSTEM WINS OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forty miles of riding and hiking trails planned for the city were reduced to a 
more modest 16-mile system by the City Council this week, saving $10 million in 
projected costs. 
</P>
<P>
 And city planners said for the first time that the county has indicated it 
will share the cost of constructing the trails, which could save another $3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's ambitious plans for more than 40 miles of horse and hiking trails 
carried an estimated $16-million price tag, according to Kia Mortazavi, 
principal transportation analyst for the city. But a committee of city and 
community representatives agreed to a compromise $6-million, 16-mile trail 
system, which was unanimously approved by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 With funding from the county, Mortazavi hopes to cut the $6-million cost in 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Board of Supervisors on Tuesday is scheduled to consider entering 
into negotiations with the city on funding the trails. The Irvine trails are 
planned to connect with a countywide equestrian and hiking trail system. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortazavi said the county has already agreed to bear the cost of maintaining 
the planned trails. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel this is a big step on the part of the county," Mortazavi told council 
members. "It's something they weren't doing before." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Greg Smith expressed concerns that some Irvine residents may be 
taxed to pay for part of the cost for trails used by residents from throughout 
the county.RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: PLACENTIA; VALENCIA STUDENTS FIND 'DEAD DAY' INSTRUCTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 45 students at Valencia High School spent Friday dressed in black, their 
faces painted white, and trying desperately not to talk. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't a mime assembly but Dead Day, an annual tradition at the school 
during Red Ribbon Week. 
</P>
<P>
 The students were dressed and made up to depict dead teen-agers who were 
victims of alcohol and drugs. Wearing mock tombstones on their shirts that told 
the story of their deaths, the students attended class but avoided unnecessary 
conversation and interaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to show students some things they may not have thought about," 
said senior Susan Hickman. "We want them to get a sense of the impact a dead 
teen-ager can have" on friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Tina Katz said that spending the day pretending to be dead was 
"creepy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially with Halloween coming up," she said. "You're sort of in this mood 
already, and then to be doing this is weird." 
</P>
<P>
 Some students joked with her about her appearance, Katz said, but others' 
reactions ranged from curious to nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 Dead Day culminated a number of activities aimed at preventing substance 
abuse. Earlier in the week, students heard from a man who was partially 
paralyzed when he crashed his car while driving drunk. A Juvenile Court judge 
and some of the youths who had appeared before him in court spoke to the 
students about the effects of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Ling Lu said that Dead Day helped her realize how many people one death 
would affect. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

 The City Council this week agreed to contribute $110,000 to an elaborate 
sports park to be built in neighboring San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 The $3.8-million park will include a community center, a swimming pool and 
fields for baseball, softball and soccer.It will be built next to Marco F. 
Forster Middle School at Camino del Avion and Del Obispo Street, at the city's 
border with Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the park is scheduled to begin in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Judy Curreri noted that although soccer fields are needed by Dana Point 
residents, some have in the past objected to their construction within the city 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really don't have enough active parks in the city, nor do we have 
neighborhood park locations that could be converted to soccer fields without 
upsetting neighbors in those areas," Curreri said. "Since we don't have 
opportunities for soccer fields within the city limits, maybe we need to look 
at regional solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman William L. Ossenmacher cast the dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have enough needs in Dana Point without exporting our tax dollars 
to San Juan," Ossenmacher said. LEN HALL

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: RAPIST GETS SIX LIFE TERMS, PLUS 122 YEARS

<P>
 A former Navy yeoman was sentenced Friday to six life terms plus 122 years in 
prison for a series of robberies and sexual assaults that terrorized beach 
communities in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Amos Dwayne Stevenson, 22, who police dubbed the "ATM rapist," stared downward 
as Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald declared him a predator. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the women assaulted said she is grappling to regain control of her life 
and came to court to watch as Stevenson was punished for his crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not the victim -- he's my victim now," declared the 35-year-old Orange 
County woman, her voice shaking as she spoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson was convicted of kidnaping and robbing six people in four separate 
encounters between September and December, 1992. Some were were attacked near 
the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station -- where Stevenson worked -- while other 
crimes occurred in Huntington Beach and Long Beach. Five of his victims were 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 In most instances, he would force his victims to drive to an automated teller 
machine and withdraw $300, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Dennis Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
 But on several occasions, he also raped or sexually assaulted the women, Bauer 
said. In one instance, Stevenson kidnaped two women who were Christmas shopping 
and locked one in the truck while he raped the other. During that attack, he 
threatened to rape the woman's friend if she did not comply, Bauer said. DNA 
evidence was used to link Stevenson to several of the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Deborah Barnum asked the judge to spare her client the 
harshest sentence, citing his age, his lack of criminal history and because he 
only used enough force to carry out his crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge noted that Stevenson made his victims pretend to enjoy their 
sexual assault, and called the defendant a "sexual predator" who deserved the 
"absolute maximum possible sentence under law." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson must serve at least 103 years in prison before he is eligible for 
parole, Bauer said. RENE LYNCH

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; SEISMIC STUDY WAKES SOME UP WITH A THUD

 The city did not drop into the ocean, a major earthquake was not triggered, 
and the military wasn't hiding anything at the Naval Weapons Station shortly 
after 3:10 a.m. Friday, when explosives were set off in a hole about 140 feet 
under the base. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the concerns of some Seal Beach residents, the U.S. Geological Survey 
experiment to map hidden fault lines left local residents with little more than 
a dull thud. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was asleep and it woke me," said Seal Beach Councilman Bill Doane, who 
lives across from the Weapons Station at Leisure World. "It sounded like 
somebody rattling the dishes." 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Brown, wife of Mayor George Brown and also a Leisure World resident, 
said she and her husband slept through the blast. "We're aware of little, tiny 
earthquake shocks when they happen, but we did not hear or feel anything," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weapons Station spokesman Joe Davidson said he received one telephone call 
from a Huntington Harbour resident who felt the blast. Davidson was about 400 
feet from the blast early Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard the thud of the blast, then sort of a rolling effect, then a geyser 
of water shot up from the hole," Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the last in a series of about 60 explosions that began Wednesday 
morning in Barstow and continued southeast to Seal Beach. Scientists hope to 
discover where major earthquakes are most likely to occur by tracking sound 
waves from the explosions on seismographs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some concern that we might trigger an earthquake, but we've had no 
complaints about the actual explosions," said seismologist Jim Mori. Mori added 
that it will take about two years to analyze data gathered from the experiment.

 A mother and four children are recovering from injuries sustained when their 
van collided with a car Thursday afternoon, UCI Medical Center officials said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie K. Reed, 27, of Huntington Beach and her 5-year-old daughter, Jessie, 
are listed in good condition, while Cathy, 9, is listed in fair condition at 
UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed's other two children who were injured in the accident -- an infant and a 
3-year-old -- were treated and released to their father Thursday night, said 
Lorraine Neher, a hospital spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that Reed was driving a Volkswagen van eastbound on 
Warner Avenue when she ran a red light at Springdale Street, hitting a Camaro 
driven by Ryan Benz of Huntington Beach, according to Mike Corcoran of the 
Huntington Beach Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Benz was taken to Huntington Beach Medical Center, but a hospital spokeswoman 
said he was released that same night. 
</P>
<P>
 The children were not wearing seat belts. No citations were issued, but police 
are still investigating, Corcoran said. NANCY HSU

<P>
 A 17-year-old gang member was sentenced Friday to 29 years to life in prison 
for fatally shooting another teen-ager last year in a dispute over a 
skateboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogelio Garcia will stay at a California Youth Authority facility until he 
turns 25, and will serve the remainder of his sentence in state prison, Deputy 
Dist. Atty.Gary Paer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The August, 1993, incident began as a teen-age squabble. Christopher Vargas, 
14, refused to give up the skateboard he used to navigate the streets of his 
Stanton neighborhood. Eduardo Guerrero, 15, was determined to get the 
skateboard and sought the help of a local street gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang members recruited Garcia, who was 16 at the time, to seek revenge, and 
the teen-ager gunned down Vargas as the victim's mother tried to shield him 
from the bullet, said Paer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The victim didn't want to give up the skateboard and he was gunned down, 
execution-style," said Paer, who added that Vargas was scheduled to move from 
the neighborhood the following day. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney William Monroe said Garcia is also a victim of gang violence 
and was afraid to refuse when gang members enlisted him. 
</P>
<P>
 "All this sentence does is compound the tragedy," Monroe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero was convicted of second-degree murder and will be released from the 
California Youth Authority when he turns 25.RENE LYNCH

 A developmentally disabled tourist from New Zealand was in critical condition 
Friday after he was rescued Thursday night from the bottom of the swimming pool 
at Buena Park Hotel and Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Ross Christensen, 46, was visiting Southern California on Thursday with a 
group of other disabled individuals under the care of community service 
workers.He was described as a poor swimmer who usually uses wading pools or 
spas, Buena Park police said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10:30 p.m., Christensen was pulled from the pool at 7675 Crescent Ave. 
by a security officer and guests after someone spotted him on the bottom, 
according to police. Firefighters performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 
took Christensen to West Anaheim Medical Center. Police said Christensen had 
been underwater for about five to 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen was with Travelplan, a New Zealand-based group that coordinates 
trips for the physically and mentally disabled, said Javed Nawaz, general 
manager at Buena Park Hotel. Christensen was accompanied by 11 others, who were 
being chaperoned by three staff members. DEBBIE KONG

 There are 1,700 lighted street signs in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials know because they counted them. 
</P>
<P>
 The city recently calculated the cost of putting block numbers on the large 
brown street-name markers that hang from traffic signals. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials discovered that the numbers can't simply be added to the existing 
signs. Rather, all 1,700 signs would have to be replaced, at a cost of 
$289,000, said Robert W. Tracy, acting public works director. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also found that adding the block numbers would require reducing the 
size of the letters that spell out the street names. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a poor "cost-benefit ratio," Tracy is not recommending any change.

MIJARES WILL HEAD SANTA ANA SCHOOLS; EDUCATION: THE NEW SUPERINTENDENT FROM 
BAKERSFIELD VOWS TO TACKLE GANGS, THE DROPOUT RATE AND TEEN-AGE PREGNANCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ending months of speculation, trustees of the Santa Ana Unified School 
District on Friday chose Al Mijares of Bakersfield as the new schools 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Sal Mendoza, announcing the unanimous decision, said: "Dr. 
Mijares is an outstanding educator and leader. He has many strong points that 
all form a total package that is just what this district needs. . . . I think 
we have made an outstanding choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Mijares, 41, currently the schools superintendent in Bakersfield, said his 
first priority will be to establish working relationships with parents, 
businesses and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be extremely naive to believe that this is a one-person job," he told the 
overflow audience in the school board room. 
</P>
<P>
 Mijares said his long-term goals include helping solve district problems such 
as gangs, dropout rate and teen-age pregnancy. He said he hopes to involve the 
community, parents and police in programs to aid students. 
</P>
<P>
 Mijares was born in Pasadena and spent his early years in an East Los Angles 
housing project, one of the middle of eight children. The family later moved to 
Santa Clara County, where his father found seasonal employment as a migrant 
farm worker. Mijares and his siblings also often worked in fields picking 
strawberries, tomatoes and green beans. 
</P>
<P>
 Mijares became superintendent at Coachella in 1990 and is credited with 
bringing the financially ailing district back to financial health, said Diane 
Thomas, spokeswoman for the Santa Ana Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 He became schools superintendent in Bakersfield in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Mijares replaces Rudy M. Castruita, who left in July to head the San Diego 
County Department of Education. The new superintendent will oversee Orange 
County's largest school district, with nearly 50,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members said Mijares was an ideal candidate, with a solid background in 
education and management who is bilingual and sensitive to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's someone who has a heart big enough to care for students, parents, 
teachers, right on up through our management team," said Trustee Audrey 
Yamagata-Noji. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Tom Chaffee said: "I just saw no negatives in him. I believe we've got 
the right man for the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Mijares and his wife, Jackie, have five sons, ranging from toddlers to 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 The board has offered Mijares a three-year contract but has not yet negotiated 
a salary and benefits package. Castruita's salary was $124,000 a year, Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mijares is expected to assume his new position around Jan. 1, she said.

DODGERS FORCED TO BORROW; BASEBALL: CLUB BLAMES STRIKE FOR NECESSITATING 
$20-MILLION LOAN TO COVER OPERATING EXPENSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN and MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The financial impact of the players' strike has prompted the Dodgers, long 
considered one of baseball's most stable and profitable franchises, to borrow 
$20 million from the club's line of credit with a Los Angeles bank, The Times 
learned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The loan takes effect Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot deny it," owner Peter O'Malley said. "We have an ongoing line of 
credit with a major bank and expect to draw on it next month to meet the 
overhead and annual expenses we have." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley said the Dodgers have borrowed before, "but not for a long time." He 
said it would be inaccurate to characterize the club as being in financial 
trouble, although he cited the loan in recent staff meetings, a source said, as 
a response to the strike's impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked on Friday whether the loan might have been necessary in part because the 
Dodgers have money tied up elsewhere and viewed it as a strategic hedge against 
an uncertain future, O'Malley refused comment. However, Bob Graziano, the 
club's vice president/finance, stressed that the loan was necessary to cover 
operating expenses, "to fund the payroll for people still working here and to 
make sure the grass gets watered." 
</P>
<P>
 Graziano said the Dodgers had been debt-free since the construction of Dodger 
Stadium, which opened in 1962, and would not have taken the loan if not for the 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone is saying the club is on the ropes," he said. "This club 
has operated debt-free and we have not had to borrow to cover operating 
expenses. The fact is, now we are borrowing to cover operating expenses. It's 
not uncommon (for a team) to borrow for capital expenses, but it's rare to 
borrow to fund operations." 
</P>
<P>
 Said O'Malley: "I hope this can help get the organization through a very 
difficult time. We're going through a very, very stormy period as an industry, 
and I'm concerned about the future of the game. However, this franchise will 
survive, and I'm very confident that the involvement of Mr. (William J.) Usery 
(as a special mediator in the bargaining negotiations) will prove to be very 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best in the business. He's resolved hundreds of cases more 
complicated than this. I think he's the right man in the right spot at the 
right time. I look for him to help identify a common ground and reach an 
agreement within the next few weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been estimated that the Dodgers lost $12 million because of the strike, 
which began Aug. 12. A source said the team, despite averaging 41,444 in 
attendance through 55 dates, would have lost about $2 million this year even if 
the season had played out, though that loss would have been reversed, it is 
believed, if the Dodgers had reached the playoffs. O'Malley refused to discuss 
the profit and loss aspect or to project a time frame that the $20 million is 
designed to cover. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's difficult to say because I'm hoping there will be an agreement with 
the players within a few weeks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers previously had eliminated 20 full-time and five part-time 
positions, cut the salaries of management personnel by 15% and non-management 
by 10% and offered early-retirement opportunities to employees 55 and over. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Executive Vice President Fred Claire said recently that the 
club's $37-million player payroll of 1994 will drop significantly next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Graziano: "These moves are too drastic to take for PR purposes. The 
borrowing was not for PR purposes. There's a lot of misconception about the 
cash flow of this ballclub. There's a misconception that our vaults are filled 
with cash. It was necessary (to take the loan)." 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve of the 28 major league teams were approved by a consortium of New York 
banks for a line of credit estimated at $360 million in 1992. Each of the 12 
has since borrowed from the line, a source said, "and I would feel confident in 
saying that most of the other 16 clubs have borrowed from their own banks in 
that time, particularly since the strike started." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley, who has been critical at times of acting Commissioner Bud Selig's 
leadership, bristled somewhat when he said of the labor situation: "It never 
should have reached this point. Both sides are at fault. Both had time to 
resolve their differences and reach an agreement before Aug. 12. Now we're all 
paying the consequences."

STANFORD'S STENSTROM STILL AMONG THE ELITE; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: SENIOR 
QUARTERBACK WILL LEAD CARDINAL AGAINST UCLA TODAY AT ROSE BOWL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Return with us to days of yore -- well, two months seems like yore when you 
have lost as many games as UCLA and Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific 10 Conference was full of quality quarterbacks, three of whom 
passed for more than 3,000 yards last season. Another had led his team to the 
Rose Bowl and still another made his team a contender every time he walked on 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Where did they go? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, USC's Rob Johnson was injured. So were Oregon's Danny O'Neil and 
California's Dave Barr. UCLA's Wayne Cook was sound, but his best receiver, 
J.J. Stokes, was sidelined in the first game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 That left Steve Stenstrom, still among the elite, still standing and still 
throwing, often and well enough to lead the conference in passing with 2,225 
yards and 14 touchdowns in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 With 66 yards against UCLA today at the Rose Bowl, he will become only the 
10th NCAA quarterback to pass for 10,000 yards, and Stanford continues to hype 
him for the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinal's 2-4-1 record, which included a four-game losing streak that was 
broken last week with a 39-25 victory over Oregon State, renders most of that 
hype ineffective. Stanford is 1-3 in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
 In four seasons at Stanford, Stenstrom is probably the most battered 
quarterback in the conference, which is something his coach, Bill Walsh, would 
like to see stopped by some rule changes, if not now, in Stenstrom's senior 
season, in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're just making it OK," Walsh said of the protection Stenstrom is 
getting from a maturing offensive line. "I don't know how many passes we've 
thrown, about 280 or something along those lines. So our sack percentage (28 
sacks, 270 passes) is tolerable, but in the meantime, Steve takes five or six 
big hits every game. By and large they're legitimate as the rules stand, but he 
takes those. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say he's taking a lot less punishment than he's taken in his previous two 
years, but he's still taking a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 If UCLA has its way today, he will take more. The Bruins are tied with Oregon 
for last in the league in sacks, with 18, but they will need some kind of pass 
rush to keep their secondary from being riddled by Stenstrom and 6-foot-6 wide 
receiver Justin Armour. 
</P>
<P>
 Armour will work on 5-9 cornerbacks Teddy Lawrence and Javelin Guidry. If 
Stenstrom has time to work, it could get ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be tough," Coach Terry Donahue said. "A 6-6 wideout obviously 
poses a lot of challenges. And the fact that last week we couldn't stop 
(Arizona) in conversion-type situations was a major concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona converted 12 of 20 third-down plays, five with passes to 6-3 Richard 
Dice. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA has its own skyscraper back at wide receiver. Stokes is starting for only 
the third time this season. He played last week, catching one pass for 18 
yards, but has practiced this week after recovering from a thigh bruise. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes caught only three passes last season against Stanford, but one was for 
a six-yard touchdown in a game the Bruins won, 28-25. The victory came after 
two losses and it launched a seven-game winning streak that took UCLA to the 
Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 It might be even more important this season. UCLA (2-6, 0-5) has lost six 
games in a row, the most since the school record for consecutive losses in a 
season, seven, was tied in 1943. 
</P>
<P>
 That Stanford is having trouble under Walsh might be regarded as salve for 
Donahue. Misery loves company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the fact that Bill's struggling points out that good coaches can 
struggle," Donahue said. "Bill has a very well-deserved reputation and has 
obviously been a very successful coach, and the fact that he's struggling helps 
me realize that it's not just me. Other guys struggle too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don Nehlen at West Virginia was 12-1 (actually 11-1) last year, and I don't 
know what he's doing this year (3-5), but he obviously doesn't have a great 
team. I don't take pleasure in the fact that they're struggling, but I do take 
solace in it. It helps alleviate some of the problems that come with losing, 
because you're not so much on an island. You're not so isolated." 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't change one thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a miserable situation," Donahue said. UCLA BRUINS

WHAT, AND WHEN, SHOULD A COACH KNOW IF A PLAYER IS IN TROUBLE?; COLLEGE 
FOOTBALL: AT THE START OF THE SEASON, USC HAD FOUR PLAYERS WITH OUTSTANDING 
WARRANTS, SEARCH OF CRIMINAL RECORDS SHOWS. COACHES THERE AND AT OTHER SCHOOLS 
SAY NUMBERS REFLECT SOCIETY.

<P>
 Jonathan Beauregard, a starting offensive lineman for the Cal State Northridge 
football team, went about his business in the normal student-athlete manner. He 
went to school, went to practice and played in the Matadors' first four games. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard's coaches didn't know he had been arrested on a charge of assault 
with a deadly weapon, a charge later upgraded to attempted murder. He had been 
booked in connection with the shooting of his former girlfriend and her male 
acquaintance. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, Northridge Coach Bob Burt found himself in a position that more and 
more coaches -- regardless of the size or status of the program -- find 
themselves. He was unaware of something he wished he had known. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the perception that more and more college athletes are getting 
into more and more trouble, Burt's situation underscored a somewhat new issue: 
How much should coaches know? Does their responsibility end when a player steps 
off the field? 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard's situation is not unique. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of several incidents, The Times conducted a computer search of Los 
Angeles County criminal records, looking at all USC and UCLA football players 
who were on each team's opening-day roster. The search showed that USC started 
the season with four players who were wanted by the police. No players from 
UCLA had outstanding warrants for their arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The search also showed that three of the four USC players are still wanted and 
considered fugitives from the law. An attorney representing one of the players 
said that he had the warrant for his client recalled and quashed on Friday. In 
addition, five other USC players had been arrested sometime since their 18th 
birthdays. In four of the latter cases, the charges were dismissed. The fifth 
player spent a year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA had one player who had been arrested for a traffic offense but was not 
jailed and is on probation. 
</P>
<P>
 The search of criminal records does not include any charges made before any of 
the players were 18, since juvenile records are not public. All the charges 
cited here are misdemeanors. Police generally do not have the manpower to 
enforce misdemeanor warrants. Most people brought to jail on these warrants are 
discovered through routine traffic stops. 
</P>
<P>
 Keyshawn Johnson, USC's star wide receiver, was in the group that at the start 
of the season was wanted by police. But his situation has since been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a warrant for Johnson's arrest in connection with the theft of a 
portable telephone and pager from an electronics store in 1991. After being 
asked about the misdemeanor warrant by a Times reporter, Johnson turned himself 
in, and the charges were recently dropped when prosecutors could not locate the 
victim of the theft. Johnson, 22, has maintained that his was a case of 
mistaken identity. USC coaches and officials said they were unaware of the 
warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the get-go, he has always denied he did this," said Michael C. Carney, 
an attorney who represents Johnson and other USC players. "He had no use for 
the phone and it wouldn't have been him." 
</P>
<P>
 USC coaches and officials also said they were unaware of other outstanding 
warrants involving their players until asked about them by The Times. The 
players and their situations: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jesse Davis, 24, is a cornerback who has played in three games and made 
five tackles. He pleaded no contest in June to carrying a concealed weapon in 
his car and driving with a suspended license. He was sentenced to four days in 
jail, two years' probation and ordered to perform 10 days of labor on a 
Caltrans clean-up team. 
</P>
<P>
 He failed to appear in court Sept. 14 to provide proof he had completed his 
Caltrans work. As a result, his probation was revoked and a $10,000 bench 
warrant was issued for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 A week before his arrest on the concealed-weapon charge, Davis was arrested 
for battery and hit-and-run with injury. He pleaded not guilty to those 
charges, and the case is scheduled for a pretrial hearing in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has pleaded not guilty and we are proceeding accordingly," Carney, also 
Davis' attorney, said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said he believed all charges against him had been resolved and referred 
further questions to his attorney. Carney said Thursday he was unaware of the 
concealed-weapon charge against Davis but on Friday said he was taking the 
case. He said that he had the warrant on Davis recalled on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mario Bradley, 22, is a cornerback who has played in five games and has 
made 15 tackles. He pleaded no contest to inflicting corporal injury on his 
spouse in July. Bradley was put on three years' probation, ordered to perform 
300 hours of community service and to pay $100 to the YWCA Battered Women's 
Shelter. Bradley, like Davis, failed to appear in court in May to show proof he 
had paid the $100 fine. His probation was revoked and a $12,500 warrant exists 
for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley was also arrested in 1992 for trying to evade a police officer, 
reckless driving, falsely representing himself to a police officer and 
resisting arrest. He pleaded guilty to all four counts in May and was sentenced 
to three years' probation and 42 days in jail. According to court records, 
Bradley was to have been allowed to serve his jail sentence in 14-day 
intervals. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley, when asked Wednesday, said he believed his attorney, Fred Anderson of 
Santa Ana, had failed to appear in court because of personal reasons. Anderson, 
citing attorney-client privilege, would not answer questions Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley also said that his jail sentence for resisting arrest had been 
suspended, but court records show that he is still scheduled to serve all 42 
days of the sentence. Again, Anderson had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Quincy Harrison, 21, is a sophomore cornerback who has played in five games 
and has 12 tackles and one interception for a touchdown. He was cited in June 
for driving without a license and for having his car windows tinted. He failed 
to appear in court in July and a $500 arrest warrant was issued. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison, when asked Wednesday, said: "I just haven't had the time to take 
care of it (the tinted windows citation) yet. I'm going to now." 
</P>
<P>
 Although there were no UCLA players on this year's opening-day roster with 
outstanding arrest warrants, the Bruins are no strangers to difficult 
situations. Earlier this month, former safety Tommy Bennett was sentenced for 
grand theft and for filing a false financial statement. Bennett would have been 
completing his junior year this season but was suspended from the team in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Bruins Jamir Miller and Bruce Walker pleaded no contest to 
receiving stolen goods. Authorities agreed to drop the charges if both players 
were not arrested for two years. Both were initially suspended from the team, 
but Miller was allowed to play last season because it was determined he had 
less involvement. Three months before that, both had been arrested in separate 
incidents for carrying concealed weapons. Miller was fined $950 and Walker $675 
for the weapons violation. Both were given two years probation. Miller is 
currently playing in the NFL with the Phoenix Cardinals and Walker was cut in 
the preseason by the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately we (coaches) all have had some of our kids get into trouble," 
UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said. "It's reflective of the troubled society we all 
live in." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach John Robinson would not discuss the specific charges against his 
players, but said that USC does take a hard look into the backgrounds of its 
recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of NCAA rules, we don't get a good chance to get to know a kid," he 
said. "The NCAA allows us to see athletes three times off campus, and once on 
campus. That's not a lot of time to evaluate his personality." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some coaches have suggested that if athletic departments are serious about 
weeding out the number of athletes with criminal backgrounds, they will recruit 
fewer junior college players. Beauregard and three of the four USC players that 
had warrants against them were junior college transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 One former college assistant who asked not to be identified said that 80% of 
junior college players were not accepted by universities immediately after high 
school because they were either poor students or had legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our administration considered junior college players risky (academically) and 
a back-door option," said Larry Smith, former USC and current Missouri coach. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, The Times prematurely reported that six of the 10 junior college 
transfers headed for USC had yet to complete their academic work. When the 
season opened, all had qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it raises the valid question of risk. Robinson disagrees that there is 
a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I refuse to accept the premise that junior college players pose more of a 
risk as a group," Robinson said. "I don't agree that players from junior 
colleges are any more of a risk. You take risks with everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to give second chances back to some of the kids who have made 
mistakes but have shown the commitment and will to change and deserve a second 
chance. If a junior college player is eligible to transfer out, that means he 
has completed 48 units' worth of work and graduated with a degree, and that 
says something about his character. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cynical person says that we take some of these risks because they're 
great athletes and because we want to win. Yes, we want to win, but that's only 
one part of why we do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You consider where this school is located . . . in a disadvantaged area, and 
as part of the community we owe it to the kid that hasn't been given a lot of 
breaks, and allow him to put those past mistakes behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do want to win, but all coaches want to say when we see our players after 
they've graduated or gone on in their lives, 'Hey, my God, I helped do some of 
that. I made a difference.' " 
</P>
<P>
 USC defensive end Marcus Bonds may be one of those who has been given a second 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds, 25, was arrested in 1990 for carrying a concealed weapon and trying to 
take a firearm and explosive into a minimum-security prison. He pleaded guilty 
to the concealed-weapon charge and was sentenced to one year in county jail and 
three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, Bonds served his one-year sentence, then enrolled 
at West L.A. Community College, where he joined the football team. He was named 
All-Western State Conference as a sophomore. In four games for the Trojans this 
season, Bonds has 12 tackles and two sacks, and has stayed out of trouble with 
police since serving his jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Lapchick, director of Northeastern University's Center for the Study 
of Sport and Society, believes that because athletes are often the most 
recognizable representative of a university, athletic departments should be as 
concerned with a recruit's personal history as they are with his talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the new standard for coaches," Lapchick said. "It's part of the 
changing rules, that coaches, for their own protection, know who they are 
bringing in. It's bad for the program if players keep going down in the police 
blotter." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Northridge football Coach Bob Burt found it offensive that any coach 
-- or newspaper -- would check athletes' records. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't run records checks and we probably never will," Burt said. "Do we 
have that right? We don't run the records of the student body at large, why 
would we run athletes? For some reason, the public has gotten the idea that 
athletes must be perfect. Athletes aren't angels. Athletes are just people." 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Penn State Coach Joe Paterno says his program does check for criminal 
records. "I'm not going to tell you how we do it, but I can assure you we get 
it done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue says that UCLA doesn't check records on prospective players but that 
the "realities" may force schools to take more precautions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schools do have a responsibility to check their kids," Donahue said. "We 
don't run checks on all the kids. We never thought we had to. I guess the way 
things are in the world today, maybe we should." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm becoming aware that you just have to look further back in people's 
careers in order to get a better understanding of their character," he said.

CORNHUSKERS BRISTLE AT THEIR DOUBTERS; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: QUARTERBACK BROOK 
BERRINGER BOLDLY STATES CASE WHILE WONDERING WHY ANYONE WOULD PICK COLORADO TO 
WIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nebraska quarterback Brook Berringer, treated more carefully than Waterford 
crystal this week, has just about had it with anyone who thinks second-ranked 
Colorado will beat the third-ranked Cornhuskers today. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Berringer figures it, the edge should go to Nebraska. After all, the 
game is at Memorial Stadium, site of 200 consecutive sellouts and home of 21 
consecutive Nebraska victories. And in case nobody noticed, the Cornhuskers 
(8-0) own the nation's longest regular-season Division I-A winning streak (21), 
haven't lost to Colorado since 1990 and are ranked third in total offense and 
third in total defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "With our offensive line and our backfield, we don't need to be scared about 
anything or anybody," Berringer said. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds nice, but Berringer forgot to mention that Colorado (7-0) is ranked 
second in total offense, 12th in rushing defense and is being compared to the 
1990 Buffalo team that shared a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and one other thing: If Berringer, who is making only his fourth start, 
gets hurt, the Cornhuskers are reduced to playing Monte Christo, a true 
freshman who can't be found in the Nebraska media guide and who shares a jersey 
number with another player. 
</P>
<P>
 It could happen, too, especially with the string of injuries suffered by 
Nebraska quarterbacks this season. Former Heisman Trophy candidate Tommie 
Frazier is sidelined for the season because of a blood clot. Berringer has to 
wear a hard-shell flak jacket to protect a lung that was partially collapsed 
Oct. 1. Third-stringer Matt Turman, a walk-on, is sidelined because of a 
shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably the worst (situation) I've ever seen or heard about," Berringer 
said. "When you're down to your last scholarship quarterback, you've got some 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble, but not turmoil. If anything, the loss of Frazier and the delicate 
health of Berringer has brought the Cornhuskers closer together. 
</P>
<P>
 The running game, sparked by sophomore I-back Lawrence Phillips and one of the 
best offensive lines in recent Nebraska history, leads the nation (390 yards 
per game). The defense is giving up an average of only 13.3 points. And then 
there is Coach Tom Osborne, who wouldn't know the word flustered if it came up 
and pulled down his pants. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Berringer gets mildly insulted at certain national broadcasters and 
sportswriters who have questioned his ability to lead the Cornhuskers past 
Colorado. OK, he said, he's not Tommie Frazier, but who is? Anyway, he can run 
the option well enough, complete his share of passes and play with pain. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of today's game, which starts at 11 a.m. CDT, two hours earlier 
than the usual Cornhusker kickoffs, will challenge No. 1 Penn State for the top 
spot in Sunday's Associated Press and USA Today/CNN polls. The Nittany Lions 
face No. 21 Ohio State today. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, today's winner becomes the logical favorite to win the Big 
Eight Conference championship, finish the regular season undefeated and receive 
an automatic bid to the Orange Bowl, where the Buffaloes or Cornhuskers would 
play, say, Miami, for a chance at the national title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've got enough weapons," Nebraska offensive tackle Rob Zatechka 
said. "I think we've done OK compensating." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cornhuskers will need to do more than that against Colorado, which 
features quarterback Kordell Stewart and a Heisman Trophy candidate in Rashaan 
Salaam. For starters, they'll need to keep Berringer free of injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of depends how you look at it," Zatechka said of the quarterback 
injuries. "You could look at it as a curse." 
</P>
<P>
 Or you could look at it the way Berringer is -- as an opportunity.

GLASSON LEADS, BUT NOT ON AUTOMATIC PILOT; GOLF: HE OVERCOMES DOUBLE BOGEY FOR 
ONE-SHOT MARGIN OVER ELS, LOWERY AND FROST. 
</P>

<P>
 Bill Glasson knows how to fly the ball to the green, how to get shots to land 
close to the hole and how to take off when he has a lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Glasson knows all this because he is a pilot, which comes in handy when he is 
at the controls of his plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Glasson had a wonderful flight Friday. He shot a three-under-par 68 and took a 
one-shot lead into the third round of the Tour Championship at the Olympic 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
 His 36-hole score of 134 leads the $3-million event and puts him in, well, the 
pilot's seat for the two final rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 If he's fortunate enough to win the $540,000 first prize, Glasson said he 
knows what not to do with the money. He won't buy a new plane. He had something 
else in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gas is expensive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the PGA Tour's richest tournament, the race to the bank is hotly contested. 
U.S. Open champion Ernie Els, Steve Lowery and David Frost share second place 
at 135. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Fehr shot 69 and is at 136. Mark McCumber was two-over par on the back 
nine and finished with a 71, which puts him at 137, three shots off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Maggert, two over par after six holes, finished with 66, the day's best 
round, and is at 138 with Corey Pavin. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, Glasson had a lively round. He had six birdies. He also had 
a bogey and a double bogey, that on the 149-yard par-three 15th. 
</P>
<P>
 Glasson was glib about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a five on the par three, which I don't think you are supposed to do," 
he said. "Otherwise it would be a par five. I guess I parred the short par 
five." 
</P>
<P>
 It was an ugly hole for Glasson. His eight-iron off the tee landed in the 
bunker. He couldn't get the ball out of the sand with his second shot, then 
two-putted from 20 feet for double bogey. 
</P>
<P>
 That put him back into a four-way tie with Els, Lowery and Frost, but only for 
a while. 
</P>
<P>
 When Glasson birdied No. 17 with a 12-foot putt, he was back in the lead 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 36 holes left and as a veteran pilot, Glasson knows it's a long 
journey. He has made many, some in his Beechcraft, flying from tournament to 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 But Glasson's appearance in this event, which features the top 30 money 
winners on the PGA Tour, is the culmination of a remarkable trip back. 
</P>
<P>
 Glasson, 34, has had four knee operations. He had a medical exemption in 1992, 
when he injured his back compensating for his knees. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Glasson had arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow to remove 
calcified deposits and he took 2 1/2 months off to recover. 
</P>
<P>
 He still played in 20 tournaments, won at Phoenix and earned $557,110 to 
finish 22nd on the money list. You would think that would be pretty satisfying 
for anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Glasson? He'd rather be flying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I play golf so I can fly," he said. "I have to do something to support my 
hobby." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he gets a thrill out of flying that he doesn't find in golf. 
</P>
<P>
 "Golf isn't life-threatening," he said. "Well, I guess it could be. Pro-ams, 
mainly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just find flying very relaxing. It's a release for me." 
</P>
<P>
 It won't be long before Nick Price gets his release from the tournament grind. 
The player of the year is next to last after shooting a 74 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Els' 67 was remarkable mainly because he had been worried about ever getting a 
chance to shoot it. He got caught in a traffic jam on the way to the course and 
had to cut short his usual warm-up routine to make his tee time. 
</P>
<P>
 After his experience with the traffic, Els said he is going to make some 
adjustments. "I'll probably take a different route," he said. "Maybe a 
helicopter." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Glasson can fly it.

 Danish Olympic swimmer Peter Rohde is on a protein diet, so he ordered fruit 
from a South American country. 
</P>
<P>
 He got more than be bargained for -- about 13 pounds of cocaine valued at $4 
million. The dope was found in a shipment at Copenhagen's main fruit and 
vegetable market. 
</P>
<P>
 Police wouldn't identify the South American country, or the type of fruit.  
</P>
<P>
 And please, no jokes about going bananas.

 Trivia time: When last did a team ranked No. 1 in the Associated Press poll 
play in the Rose Bowl game?

 Confession: Mike Royko in the Chicago Tribune on baseball owners paying huge 
sums to mediocre players:  
</P>
<P>
 "Now they are saying, 'Save us from our silliness.' Sorry but you should join

 Forgettable season: Jackie Robinson, one of UCLA's most famous athletes, 
played on its worst football team.  
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins had a 1-9 record in 1940, losing a school-record seven consecutive 
games before beating Washington State, 34-26. Robinson, a halfback, averaged 
only 3.2 yards a carry after averaging a school-record 12.2 in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
 Snubbed: In 1932, Colgate was undefeated, untied and unscored on in nine games 
-- and uninvited to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Unbeaten Pittsburgh got the invitation instead and lost to USC, 35-0. There 
were no other major bowl games at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Settling down: Remember Darryl Dawkins, the backboard shattering center with 
the Philadelphia 76ers who once declared his homeland as the Planet Lovetron? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, he has come back to earth with the Sioux Falls Skyforce of the 
Continental Basketball Assn. and is hoping to get back to the NBA.

 Conventional wisdom: ESPN analyst Beano Cook in the News and Observer in 
Raleigh, N.C.: "Writing is the hardest job there is. The other two? Moving and

 "You go 9-2 as a football coach, you've had a good year. You go 9-2 as a 
traffic controller and it's a bad day."

 There's a limit: Asked whether he would manage the Oakland Athletics in 1995 
if the Haas family sold the team, Tony La Russa said:  
</P>
<P>
 "That depends. . . . If they sold it to a group of writers, then I would 
exercise the option and I'm out of here."

 Easy game: Golf hackers have to be envious of Bruce Lietzke. The veteran 
player takes considerable time off from the PGA Tour, but it doesn't affect his 
performance.

<P>
 "I've used the same swing for 20 years, so that allows me to go home and not 
touch a club," Lietzke told Steve Hershey of USA Today.

LAPD CALLS ALERT FOR STUDENT RALLIES; POLICE: MORE THEN 200 OFFICERS ARE SENT 
IN DURING ANTI-PROP. 187 PROTESTS. SOME INCIDENTS OF VANDALISM ARE REPORTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department clearly took the anti-Proposition 187 
protests in the San Fernando Valley on Friday seriously, declaring a citywide 
tactical alert and putting into action training that officers received after 
the violent civil disturbances of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Police dispatched more than 200 officers to protest sites. Officers donned 
riot gear to control hundreds of students gathered at the Van Nuys Civic 
Center. There were no arrests reported by day's end but authorities described 
"isolated incidents of vandalism," including sporadic rock and bottle throwing 
and stealing. 
</P>
<P>
 Police used pepper spray on several unruly students and at least one patrol 
car's window was smashed by unruly demonstrators, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're drawing on the civil disturbance training," said Officer Rigo Romero, a 
police spokesman in Parker Center. "We're not using all our tactics but the 
principle is the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Police, for instance, were armed with shotguns loaded with non-lethal rubber 
bullets. No shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Although student walkouts have been increasing in city schools for a week, the 
LAPD still appeared to be searching Friday for the best approach to the 
demonstrations, expected to continue until the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Division Capt. Richard Eide reversed a decision made by supervisors 
at the Van Nuys Civic Center demonstration site to simply disperse several 
hundred students back into the street. Instead, Eide, after coordinating with 
school officials, told officers to order students onto school buses that drove 
the youths back to campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are high school kids," he said at the scene. "They are just out having 
a civics lesson. They have the right to protest. I have no problem with that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Devonshire Division Capt. Vance Proctor, meanwhile, had devised an approach 
for Friday's demonstrations that he said he may change in the coming days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today's approach was as long as they were obeying the law, we would allow 
them to demonstrate," he said. "But clearly we can't have students all over the 
city leaving school and draining police resources." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Proctor said, in the future police may decide to force students to return 
to school more quickly to free up police resources. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Chief Willie L. Williams ordered the tactical alert to keep officers on 
duty in case the protests grew violent. It also allows for officers to move to 
other cross-town divisions, if needed.  
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the 1992 riots, all LAPD officers began to receive special 
"unusual occurrence" training aimed at changing the department's image after 
the days of rioting following the verdicts in the Rodney King beating trial. At 
the core of the two-day training sessions were specially designed exercises in 
rescuing victims, dispersing hostile crowds and using tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials said they were treating anti-Proposition 187 protests as they 
do other mass demonstrations. But because the demonstrators are school youths, 
police aimed to direct them back to class.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our response has nothing to do with what the protest is about," said LAPD Lt. 
John Dunkin of the department's media relations office. "Our goal is to 
maintain public safety, the flow of traffic and limit civil disorder." 
</P>
<P>
 Some officers expressed frustration with school authorities for not doing more 
to keep the student protests from spilling off the campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students decided to be truant and the school didn't stop them," said Van Nuys 
Division Sgt. George Wright. "Most of these kids are not being violent. Since 
the school administration refused to deal with the children, our policy has 
been to escort them and keep them from breaking laws and being run over." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In other nearby jurisdictions, law enforcement agencies have also responded 
firmly to student demonstrators in recent weeks. Officers used special crowd 
control grenades that scatter rubber pellets to disperse the crowds in Downey 
and Paramount last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The California National Guard, meanwhile, was warned recently of the potential 
for violence during Proposition 187 protests at the border, said guard 
spokesman Deirdre Allingham from Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Allingham said a memo from the state Department of Justice had warned that the 
guard should be available if the need should arise. The state Office of 
Emergency Services asked that the guard conduct a "telephonic response check" 
to ensure that the lines of communication are open with commanders and key 
leaders on those dates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a way of assessing how easy it is to get in touch via telephone," 
Allingham said. "We only drill one weekend a month -- it's not like a normal 
business where you're there every day." 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure is routine for events in which guard assistance might be 
necessary, such as during a major fire. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a "heads up," Allingham said. "Be aware of the situation and be 
available."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDENT CREDITS PIERCE LEARNING LAB FOR AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Marc Shomer had never been a great student. All through his educational 
career, first at Chandler Elementary School, then Van Nuys Middle School and 
Van Nuys High School, Shomer's report cards were marked with mostly Cs and Ds, 
with an occasional A in physical education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never really grasped the concept of spelling and that sort of thing, but I 
was always pretty good in science and math," Shomer recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall of 1988, the Encino resident enrolled at Pierce College where 
during his third year -- while he was teaching himself biology and chemistry -- 
an English tutor suggested that Shomer get tested for a learning disability. 
</P>
<P>
 At Pierce's learning lab, Shomer was diagnosed as having both dyslexia and 
dysgraphia, a writing impairment. At about the same time, Shomer applied to 
UCLA to pursue undergraduate work in neuroscience. At first, he was rejected. 
But after an appeal explaining that he had just been diagnosed with two 
learning disabilities, UCLA accepted Shomer. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, Shomer will be one of four students at UCLA to be awarded the College 
of Letters and Sciences Award, the highest award an undergraduate student can 
receive. Currently, Shomer is finishing his bachelor's and master's degrees in 
neuroscience through a special scholar program at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Shomer said he owes much of his academic success to the education he received 
at Pierce College.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are great professors there and they are there to teach, and teach you. 
. . . You can really decide what it is you want to do (at Pierce)," Shomer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although UCLA has offered him an excellent education, Shomer said he received 
more personal attention at Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing that is so important is that anybody, especially schoolteachers . . 
. be aware of their students. . . . Experts should be called upon to look at 
all these (children who may have learning disabilities)," Shomer said. MAKI 
BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; HALLOWEEN A SPOOKY HOLIDAY FOR PETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every year around Halloween, Dr. James Isaacs' veterinary clinic turns into a 
kind of triage for pets that have been maimed or fallen sick. 
</P>
<P>
 Some animals are brought in with serious digestive problems from eating 
theobromine, an ingredient in chocolate candy that has a toxic effect on 
animals. Others become sick after eating plastic, aluminum foil or other kinds 
of candy wrappers or candle wax. 
</P>
<P>
 Halloween, the veterinarian said, is not a good holiday for pets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keep your cat or your dog locked in the bedroom during Halloween," advised 
Isaacs. "They need to miss it." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the dangers of accidents, Isaacs warned, animals can also fall 
victim to sadistic pranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year Isaacs treated a black cat that had been doused with lighter fluid 
and severely burned. "Thirty percent of it's fur and skin was burned," he said. 
"The cat took a long time to recover. Its skin was peeling off when some 
neighbors found it hiding under some bushes and brought it in." 
</P>
<P>
 Black cats are at particular peril during Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another black cat I treated had been tortured with firecrackers," the 
veterinarian said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, we're instructing pet stores and animal shelters not to sell or 
give away any black cats during Halloween season." 
</P>
<P>
 Dogs are not immune from cruel tricks. Last year the veterinarian treated a 
collie that had been attacked by a group of kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tied string around it's tail and tied cans to the string," Isaacs said. 
"They left the string tied on, tightly knotted, for several days. It became 
infected and I had to amputate the tail." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving large amounts of candy unattended can pose a danger to pets. Isaacs 
displayed several kinds of Halloween treats that could be lethal, including a 
lollipop that lights up when pressed. Another lollipop spins around when a 
button is pushed. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kinds of things have batteries in them, light bulbs, even circuitry," 
Isaacs said, holding up the Candypager, a purple and orange candy dispenser 
designed to look like a pager, complete with belt-clip. Other items potentially 
hazardous to pets' health include fluorescent light sticks, which illuminate 
when broken in half. TIM MAY

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; MENTOR DAY FOR STUDENTS SET NOV. 17 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Eighty San Fernando High School students will spend a day with area business 
leaders next month under a program sponsored by the school's Business Academy 
and the San Fernando Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The second annual Mentor Day will be held Nov. 17 as part of American 
Enterprise Week. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the local business community are being sought to host students 
eager to be exposed to the business world and to learn about what it takes to 
succeed.  
</P>
<P>
 The students will spend the day with the professionals to learn first-hand 
about the challenges and realities of the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Mentors have volunteered from about eight companies so far, including SAMCO 
Corp., which manufactures medical pipettes and First Interstate Bank, said 
Arlene Rosenblatt, instructor at the school's Business Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those eight companies can only accommodate about 16 to 20 students, so we 
need quite a few additional mentors," Rosenblatt said.  
</P>
<P>
 The school's Business Academy students are preparing for a range of careers 
including accounting, personnel, administration and international business.  
</P>

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: ARLETA; ASIAN AMERICAN HEALTH FAIR PLANNED

<P>
 Free health screenings and cultural performances will be featured at a health 
fair sponsored by a local Asian American group on Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The Asian Pacific Islanders Council of the San Fernando Valley will hold its 
third annual Asian Pacific Family Health and Cultural Day from 10 a.m. to 3 
p.m. at the Japanese American Community Center, 12953 Branford St., Arleta. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to inform the Asian community about health issues because we believe 
there isn't enough information available to them," said Susan Shin, who is 
helping to coordinate the event for the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "The San Fernando Valley is composed of such a diverse community of Asian 
groups. This is sort of a centralized event that will bring the community out 
to one location, where they can learn about different social service providers. 
Another thing is that low-income families can get free screenings." Those who 
come to the fair can be tested for high blood pressure and vision problems, 
receive immunizations and dental care, and be examined by a podiatrist.  
</P>
<P>
 Children's activities will include a puppet show and face painting. Cultural 
presentations will include Vietnamese singers, Lok Tong exercise, Thai 
vegetable carving and traditional dances. 
</P>
<P>
 According to organizers, 200 people attended the first health fair and 500 
attended last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is a coalition of community organizations, social service 
providers and individuals formed for the purpose of promoting the social and 
cultural interests of the Valley Asian Pacific Islander Community. According to 
the group, more than 100,000 Asian and Pacific Islanders live in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Event sponsors include the United Way, Kaiser Permanente, Blue Cross, American 
Red Cross, the Japanese American Community Center and the Cal State Northridge 
Asian American Studies Department. KAY HWANGBO

ELECTION '94; 42ND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democrat Wallace Knox, 47, is an attorney and has been an elected member of 
the Board of Trustees of the Los Angeles Community College District since 1987. 
A resident of Larchmont Village, Knox is married with two children. Republican 
Robert Davis, 49, is a swimming pool contractor who ran for the same seat two 
years ago. He is single and lives in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The dam of political ambition on the West Side burst when state Assemblyman 
Burt Margolin decided to run for Insurance Commissioner rather than seek 
reelection. Seven Democrats, four of them elected officials, quickly filled the 
ring with their hats. 
</P>
<P>
 And their money. Altogether the Democrats spent more than $1.5 million on the 
June intra-party contest, making it one of the most expensive Assembly 
primaries in California history. Knox, an attorney who is married to Beth 
Garfield (also a college trustees member), spent nearly $450,000 - more than 
half of it his own money. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrayed against Knox were several youthful, entry-level politicians and 
statehouse wanna-be's, including West Hollywood city councilmembers Abbe Land 
and Paul Koretz and Los Angeles school board member Mark Slavkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox established himself early as the tough guy on the block by favoring the 
death penalty, three-strikes-you're-out for violent felons and indeterminate 
sentencing. This political metaphor was reinforced by mailers that told voters 
Knox was a Vietnam veteran (albeit, a Harvard-educated one, who entered the 
army a Republican but came out a leftist). 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Knox was not all iron and steel. The candidate also proudly talked of 
his authorship of an ambitious program for at-risk youths. 
</P>
<P>
 So, what did his half-million dollar campaign buy? Not quite 22% of the vote, 
but also a first place finish. And that probably is all it will take for Knox 
to become the next assemblyman in a district that includes Sherman Oaks, 
Beverly Hills and Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, the Republican, calls himself a libertarian-conservative whose views 
are not all that much farther to the right than those of Knox. One big 
difference, however, says Davis, who is running a shoestring budget campaign, 
is that Knox will be beholden to all the public employee groups that 
contributed to his campaign and he will not.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; JOB PROGRAM HELPS TROUBLED YOUTHS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some have been involved in gangs, others have had trouble in school and others 
were held back by low self-esteem. But this week, 39 teen-agers began turning 
their lives around by graduating from a job training program for youths with 
special needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came here I was shy and quiet, but in these weeks I've changed a 
lot. Now I have confidence and I take initiative," said Noelle Santamaria, 17, 
a member of the fifth graduating class of the We Care For Youth retail job 
skills program at the Glendale Galleria shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-week program, co-sponsored by the Glendale Unified School District 
and the mall, teaches high school students the basics of working in a store 
through on-the-job training at the mall and helps them develop skills needed to 
succeed in job interviews.  
</P>
<P>
 Though it is open to all students, the program is geared for at-risk youths 
and, like Santamaria, many of the participants come from Alan F. Daily High 
School, a continuation school. 
</P>
<P>
 "All together, we have trained about 400 young people in this program in the 
last three years," said Jose Quintanar, a founder of We Care For Youth. "The 
important thing to know about these students is that none of them had to be 
here. This is something they chose to do; it is not part of school." 
</P>
<P>
 The 39 graduates, their families and school officials attended a brief 
commencement ceremony Thursday at the shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the graduates were hired by the stores they worked for during 
the program and will start their jobs immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Pilgreen, principal of Daily High School, said he has noticed a 
"definite improvement" in behavior and attendance at school among the students 
who have graduated from the jobs program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids at Daily are probably the ones who need the kind of training and 
attention this program offers. There's a real focus on respect and attention to 
duty," Pilgreen said. STEVE RYFLE

 Horror of horrors! A Harding Avenue house is no longer haunted. 
</P>
<P>
 An 8-year-old, neighborhood Halloween tradition has ended due to 
overpopularity.A homeowner who used to delight in devising elaborate 
decorations for his house and yard has called it quits because of the stress of 
crowd control. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Santelmann began, innocently, with a few stuffed-pillow ghosts and some 
drugstore decorations. The kids liked it, so Santelmann, a machinist at Six 
Flags Magic Mountain, added a little to his display each year. 
</P>
<P>
 He put a skeleton on a Harley-Davidson and stuck an ax in its bony grip. He 
figured out a way to make the ghosts levitate. There were cracked skulls, 
bloodied monsters, gravestones, a collapsing wall and a mausoleum. 
</P>
<P>
 Word got around. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, an estimated 2,000 children trucked through his house, gleefully 
screaming as they came upon his displays. The city had to close down his block 
of Harding Avenue to traffic to accommodate the crowds of costumed 
thrill-seekers.  
</P>
<P>
 The annual Halloween extravaganza became so big that Santelmann said it was no 
longer manageable. "After seven years, the show outgrew the home," Santelmann 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just got to be too much, the stress, the time invested, the money. I 
didn't have enough people helping me this year."  
</P>
<P>
 What about the kids? 
</P>
<P>
 "You bet I've got kids complaining," Santelmann says, but enough was enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had just spent too much of my own time and money on this project in the 
past. There's nothing I could do about it, the thing just became too big. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time for someone else to do it." TIM MAY

<P>
 Hundreds of hardcover books and paperbacks priced as low as 25 cents will be 
sold Nov. 12 at the Sylmar Branch Library. 
</P>
<P>
 The used book sale is scheduled from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the library parking 
lot at 13059 Glenoaks Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds will go to the library for the purchase of books and library 
materials and to fund children's programs, according to Irma Goodman, a 
spokeswoman for Friends of the Sylmar Library. The library is hard-pressed to 
afford these items because of budget cuts, she said.

STAGE IS SET FOR SOKA, STATE BATTLE; CALABASAS: JUDGE THROWS OUT LAST 
CONDEMNATION CHALLENGES FILED BY SCHOOL. BOTH SIDES PRESENT CASES NEXT MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After nearly two years of preliminary skirmishes, a judge this week cleared 
the way for Soka University and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy to face 
off in a key fight over the school's scenic Calabasas campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides meet Nov. 23 in Los Angeles Superior Court to argue whether the 
conservancy has the right to condemn a part of Soka's campus at Mulholland 
Highway and Las Virgenes Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hearing in November is the prize fight," Soka spokesman Jeff Ourvan said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy staff counsel Liz Cheadle agreed, saying, "This is big, big." 
</P>
<P>
 If a judge determines that the conservancy -- a state agency that acquires 
parkland -- has the right to take 245 acres of Soka's property, the case will 
then go to a jury to decide how much the school should be paid for the land. 
</P>
<P>
 November's hearing is a critical point in the eminent domain case, coming two 
years after the conservancy initially began condemnation proceedings in late 
1992. The delay resulted from a series of legal challenges that have cost both 
sides hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ruling released Friday, Judge Robert H. O'Brien threw out the last of 
several challenges filed by Soka in its effort to fight the conservancy's 
condemnation. In its latest challenge, the school argued that the conservancy 
should have conducted an environmental analysis of the condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
 The school argued such a review was necessary because, it claimed, the 
conservancy intends to sell the property to the National Park Service to use as 
a visitors' center for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Brien said no review was required because the conservancy intends to 
essentially preserve the site, which includes the historic estate built by 
shaving razor magnate King Gillette. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka's Ourvan said the school will appeal O'Brien's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 When Soka and conservancy lawyers finally do present their cases before Judge 
Barnet Cooperman, their arguments will sound familiar. Soka lawyers will argue, 
as they did in 1992 before a different judge, that the conservancy violated 
state law when it began condemnation proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 The condemnation is being pursued by an arm of the conservancy called the 
Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority. Because the authority has a 
joint powers agreement with two Ventura County parks agencies, it received 
permission from that county's Board of Supervisors to begin the condemnation -- 
even though Soka is entirely within Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Soka lawyers argue that the approval is invalid, and that permission should 
have come from the state Board of Public Works, which signs off on condemnation 
attempts by state agencies such as the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ventura County judge agreed with Soka in 1992, but she was overturned by the 
state Court of Appeal, which ruled that the school should raise its objections 
during the hearing scheduled for Nov. 23.

MAN RESENTENCED IN SLAYING WITH LYE; CRIME: CONVICTED MURDERER OF A SYLMAR 
WOMAN GETS CREDIT FOR 14 YEARS HE HAS SERVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man convicted in a retrial of murdering a Sylmar woman by throwing lye in 
her face 14 years ago was again sentenced Friday to 25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricardo H. Robinson, who acted as his own attorney, was also convicted of 
mayhem, conspiracy and assault for the Aug. 14, 1980, fatal attack on law 
student Patricia Worrell, who was 34. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert L. Cohen said that Robinson, who was originally 
convicted in 1982 and gets credit for the 14 years he has already served in 
prison, may have erred by representing himself in the Van Nuys Superior Court 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court really went out of its way to protect" Robinson's right to proper 
representation," Cohen said. "Unfortunately, when you choose to represent 
yourself you often make mistakes, and he made mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, 36, formerly of Las Vegas, was convicted by a jury on July 21 after 
two days of deliberation. Robinson had taken the witness stand and denied any 
role in the attack. But his testimony was thrown out after he refused to answer 
questions by Cohen under cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell's son, William -- who was 13 when his mother died -- and Robinson's 
convicted accomplice, Bobby Ray Savage, identified Robinson as the man who had 
thrown a quart of lye in Worrell's face when she answered a knock at her door. 
</P>
<P>
 The lye blinded and disfigured Worrell. She died 10 days later, after the 
caustic chemical she accidentally ingested burned through her esophagus and an 
artery. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, Savage testified that Worrell's jilted fiance, fellow law 
student Richard Morton Gilman, had hired him to disfigure Worrell because she 
refused to give back an engagement ring. The payoff was to be $1,500 but, 
according to testimony, Gilman only paid him $750. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilman -- who was inside the house with Worrell when the attack occurred -- 
denied hiring the men. He and Savage were both convicted of murder and are 
serving sentences of 25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson was retried after the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeal ruled two 
years ago that police took incriminating statements from him after he had 
demanded a lawyer but before one was provided.

LEGAL SAMARITAN IS NOW ON RIGHT SIDE OF LAW; RESCUE: NORTH HOLLYWOOD LAWYER 
JOHN LESLIE, WHO GAVE FIRST AID TO A FELLOW TEST-TAKER, IS HONORED BY THE RED 
CROSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Leslie is on the right side of the law now -- or, at least, the State Bar 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old North Hollywood man is a practicing attorney but his budding 
legal career looked in doubt a year ago, when the Bar denied Leslie and four 
others extra time on the grueling Bar exam after they stopped to administer 
first aid to another test-taker who suffered an epileptic seizure. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, amid national attention, the Bar relented and took into account 
the disruption. As a result, Leslie and a fellow Good Samaritan passed. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Leslie was honored by the American Red Cross for his part in 
reviving the stricken test-taker by using the cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
techniques he learned from the Red Cross as a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard L. Berman, himself a certified attorney, congratulated Leslie for 
jumping to the epilepsy victim's rescue instead of carrying on with the exam. 
About 500 others apparently ignored the man's predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a message for humanity. Who knows what anyone would've done in that 
situation?" said Berman (D-Panorama City). "I took the Bar exam. It's perhaps 
the most traumatic episode you can go through in your life. Every pressure 
imaginable is on you. You're thinking about your own performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Berman presented Leslie with a Red Cross Certificate of Merit signed by 
President Clinton. The award is the latest accolade in the recognition Leslie 
has received, including an appearance soon after the exam on the "Tonight Show 
with Jay Leno" -- a far less nerve-racking event, Leslie said, than Friday's 
brief ceremony at the Van Nuys office of the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a lot less stressful there. You're just sittin' around, shootin' the 
breeze," Leslie said. "Here it's hard to stand with your knees locked." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's Bar exam at the Pasadena Convention Center was Leslie's second 
attempt at passing the intense three-day test. It was also the second time he'd 
used the CPR techniques he learned when he was 15 years old during lifeguard 
training in New York. (The first was on a neighbor who suffered a heart 
attack.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Pasadena incident spawned a fresh round of lawyer jokes and public 
snickers. Asked Friday whether he didn't mind being associated with a 
profession that nearly denied him membership on what others saw as a heartless 
technicality, Leslie was diplomatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately the Bar handled the situation in a fair way," he said. "A lot of 
the reputation for the legal profession has been deserved in the past. . . . 
But it's turning around." 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, the saxophonist-turned-Whittier Law School graduate works out 
of his North Hollywood apartment and in Montebello with another attorney. 
Although entertainment law once beckoned, criminal law now seems the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's still getting calls from folks who remember his story from its 
telling and retelling in the press. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have actually cut out the article," Leslie said, "and stuck it on 
their wall, and they say, 'Someday when I need a lawyer. . . .' "

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; QUAKE-DAMAGED STADIUM APPROVED FOR REOPENING 
</P>

<P>
 College of the Canyons received verbal approval Friday afternoon to reopen its 
earthquake-damaged stadium next week, just in time for local high school 
football playoff games and a multi-state band competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The structure and running track sustained more than $600,000 in damage from 
the Northridge earthquake.Repairs were delayed several times by soil settling 
under the 7,500-seat stadium. Finally, last week, the last major repair was 
made when concrete was poured to replace a cracked stairwell. 
</P>
<P>
 A safety inspection by county and state officials was originally scheduled 
Monday to allow the concrete to completely dry, said college spokeswoman Sue 
Bozman. But the college convinced officials to make the tour Friday, giving 
local high schools a few extra days to plan events scheduled next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of Rampage, a band competition scheduled next Saturday for 26 high 
schools from three states, said they had been making plans to shift the event 
to a smaller stadium at Canyon High School in Canyon Country, which would have 
had insufficient parking for participants. 
</P>
<P>
 The stadium is also normally used by three local high schools for many of 
their home games, said Daniel Hanigan, interim superintendent of the William S. 
Hart Union High School District. He said about three-fourths of this year's 
schedule has already been played, but he is glad the stadium will be available 
for the most important games -- the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The larger stadium is often critical to having home games," he said.

PALMDALE HAS A 'TEACHER OF THE YEAR'; EDUCATION: RICHARD CHAPLEAU BECOMES ONE 
OF FIVE STATE WINNERS OF THE COVETED AWARD. HE STRESSES VALUE OF REAL-LIFE 
ABILITIES.

 A Palmdale High School science teacher has been named a California Teacher of 
the Year for 1995, one of only two in Los Angeles County and five statewide to 
receive the distinction. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Chapleau, an enthusiastic man with just five years experience in 
public education, said the award was unexpected, to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surprised is a remarkably understated term. I'm overwhelmed. I feel like 
Cinderella," said Chapleau, 39, who teaches in the Antelope Valley Union High 
School District. "I don't know why it happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The winning teachers were announced Thursday by the California Department of 
Education. They were chosen from among 52 instructors who received similar 
distinction within their individual school districts. More than 58,000 
full-time instructors were eligible for the award in Los Angeles County alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The teacher of the year distinction is considered one of the most 
distinguished and coveted awards that a teacher can receive during their 
career," said Laurie Twineham, coordinator of the award program for the Los 
Angeles County Office of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of Cal State Northridge and Chapman University with a degree in 
molecular biology, Chapleau previously taught electrician apprentices as a 
member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union. He says 
his experience in private industry has given him a better perspective on 
preparing students for the real world. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal here isn't so much to teach chemistry as it is to teach life skills," 
said Chapleau, who lives in Lancaster. "I want them to succeed in the real 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Chapleau said he stresses to his students the importance of real-life 
abilities such as meeting deadlines and accomplishing tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 He also helped establish a medical magnet program at Palmdale High School. 
Students there can learn about medical professions and attend orientation 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There really are fairy tales," Chapleau said. "When I first came into 
Palmdale High School five years ago, I thought they would come in at the end of 
the first week and say 'Can we have the keys back?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The only reason anyone has asked for Chapleau's keys lately has been to 
decorate his room. 
</P>
<P>
 Students stayed after school Thursday to hang a congratulatory banner over his 
classroom chalkboard and dub his chair "the throne." They decorated his walls 
with Snickers bars -- a favorite snack -- and created models of molecules out 
of Smarties candies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stay here because I love it here," Chapleau said. "This is a magic place. 
It's like Disneyland. It feels like the Matterhorn and I've got an E ticket 
every morning."

RELIGION JOHN DART; REFORM JEWISH HIGH SCHOOL CARVES NICHE IN CITY ON A HILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's only Reform Jewish high school next month will move to temporary 
classrooms on what eventually will be a $25-million campus hugging a hillside 
in the Sepulveda Pass amid a cluster of Jewish institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The school was launched three years ago by the 3,000-family Stephen S. Wise 
Temple of Bel-Air, the second-largest synagogue in the country. But the 
impending move is a big step upward for the temple's ambitious effort to 
demonstrate that a relatively liberal, non-Orthodox high school can fill the 
Judaic education gap for teen-agers who might otherwise drift away from Jewish 
culture and faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teen-age education is critical to the future of Jewish life in America," said 
the temple's senior rabbi, Isaiah Zeldin. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Reform and Conservative synagogues "have day schools up to the age of 13, 
but we do very poorly beyond the bar and bat mitzvahs," Zeldin said, referring 
to the Jewish coming-of-age ceremonies for adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orthodox synagogues have had high schools for 50 years, but with our 
elementary, middle school and now high school classes," Zeldin said, "we have 
the only non-Orthodox K-through-12 school west of Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
 The Stephen Wise Community Middle/High School has not only a well-to-do 
congregation behind it but a culturally rich location -- "a little piece of 
Jewish heaven," in the words of Headmaster Bruce Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 The elongated 9.7-acre campus runs along Mulholland Drive just west of the San 
Diego Freeway and up from the Skirball Cultural Center under construction on 
Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The cultural center is being built by Hebrew Union College, another Reform 
Jewish institution. Slated for opening by next fall, the center will feature a 
museum and an academic conference center devoted to the theme of "exploring the 
American Jewish experience," said Executive Director Cindy Miscikowski. 
</P>
<P>
 Across from the center on the eastern side of the freeway, also off Mulholland 
Drive, is the Conservative-aligned University of Judaism, and further up the 
hill, the Stephen S. Wise Temple. 
</P>
<P>
 The high schoolers, who now take classes in rooms at the temple, have library 
privileges and access to a science laboratory at the University of Judaism, and 
that will continue, Zeldin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council approved the building project in February, after 
modifications were made in the plans last year to meet objections by some 
neighbors worried about school-related traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The school will be limited to 165 students for several years while classes are 
held in temporary modular buildings on the site. Although current enrollment is 
195 students in grades 9 through 12, Powell said that at any given time about 
three dozen students will be at the old site in science or physical-education 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The second phase of construction, due to be completed by 1997, will permit an 
enrollment up to 650 students, including seventh- and eighth-grade students who 
now meet in temporary buildings further west on Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Permanent facilities at the east end of the campus closest to the freeway will 
include a three-story building for classes and offices as well as library, 
gymnasium and multipurpose facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (roof of the) building can't be more than 15 feet above Mulholland Drive, 
so the main building will only be three stories at the base of the hillside," 
the rabbi explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, as stipulated by the city, the school will plant bushes and trees along 
a narrow, 2,000-foot stretch between Mulholland and the school property. 
</P>
<P>
 To alleviate traffic, the school will continue to shuttle many students by bus 
from parking lots in the San Fernando Valley and the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell said that the temple's schools draw equal numbers of students from 
north and south of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a middle school for close to 15 years now," Zeldin said. Some of 
the graduates went on "to a community high school in the Valley run by the 
Conservative movement, the Einstein Academy," the rabbi said, but that school 
never enrolled more than 100 students and eventually closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuition is about $11,000 a year at Stephen Wise Community Middle/High School, 
but Zeldin said the school has a liberal scholarship policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a family can pay only half, then they pay half," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The student body has a degree of cultural diversity. "We have a sprinkling of 
Asian, black and other non-Jewish students as well as Iranian and Russian 
Jews," Zeldin said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, even non-Jewish students are required to take classes in Hebrew and 
Jewish studies, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the high school functions under the aegis of a Reform temple, the 
educational aim is broadly Jewish -- albeit without adhering to some of the 
traditionalist Jewish law practiced in Orthodox Judaism. Food served at the 
high school will be kosher, but the rabbi said that lunches brought by students 
won't be examined to see if they meet dietary rules. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The philosophical shift is one that values both traditional and modern 
interpretations of Jewish life," said Powell, the headmaster, who previously 
served as principal for secular courses at Yeshiva University High Schools, an 
Orthodox organization in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half of our faculty for Jewish studies at our new high school is affiliated 
with Reform and half with Conservative synagogues," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Zeldin, 74, the synagogue's schools have been a major accomplishment for 
Jewish education during his 31 years as the congregation's spiritual leader. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also demonstrated the more mundane enthusiasms associated with high 
school spirit. Only minutes into an initial interview, Zeldin marveled over the 
14-7 water-polo victory by the Stephen Wise Wildcats over Calabasas High. 
</P>
<P>
 An upset, he boasted.

 PROPOSITION OPPOSITION: The Antelope Valley Interfaith Council has called for 
the defeat of Proposition 187, the ballot initiative that would deny certain 
educational and social services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved a statement at its Oct. 19 meeting that advanced moral 
and practical arguments against the "Save Our State" measure, which is also 
opposed by the state's Catholic bishops and many other mainline religious 
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement said that although the council recognized the need for a remedy 
to illegal immigration, "we are convinced that Proposition 187 will do nothing 
to resolve this situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement quoted the Biblical verses Exodus 23:9 and Matthew 25:35-40 in 
support of its declaration that "in God's eyes no one is an illegal immigrant," 
according to Rabbi Alan Henkin, a council spokesman. 
</P>

CABRILLO SCHOOL DISTRICT REJECTS BAN ON HOMEWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. La GANGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trustees of the Cabrillo Unified School District in the tiny coastal town of 
Half Moon Bay voted late Thursday before an audience of nearly 200 people to 
review their homework policies rather than abolish homework.  
</P>
<P>
 With television cameras from around the country present, the board voted 3 to 
1, with one abstention, to create a task force to review the district's 
homework policies, investigate how assignments are given and come back in 
January with preliminary proposals for change. 
</P>
<P>
 The abstainer was trustee Garrett Redmond, the flamboyant farmer who forced 
this Northern California town into the international spotlight two weeks ago 
when he asked his school district to eliminate homework because, he said, it is 
inequitable and cuts into family time. 
</P>
<P>
 Redmond left the meeting early because it had turned into a circus, he said. 
"I got tired of hearing that (the suggestion) was an embarrassment," he said. 
Of the vote, he remarked: "That's what I call government psychobabble for 'they 
killed it.' Whenever any government body sets something for study, it's headed 
for the round file." 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Jane Martin opposed banning homework but said district policies setting 
minimum homework times for students at all grade levels could stand some 
change. To her, the outcome of Half Moon Bay's two weeks in the limelight was 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she was particularly impressed by the students who spoke at the 
meeting. "They all felt that there should be some homework," Martin said. "But 
they thought it would be appropriate to look at the amount, expectations and 
coordination." 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that it can count for as much as 50% of a grade, Redmond called 
homework inequitable because he said it favors computer-savvy, upper-income 
children at the expense of the poor. Homework also clashes with family time, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some speakers at the meeting called his proposal a "goofy idea" that would 
sabotage the district's children in college and said it had made Half Moon Bay 
into a laughingstock. But most who rose from the crowd packed into an 
elementary school auditorium agreed that something should be changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Dahlen, 11, said her sixth-grade homework was oppressive, often taking 
her until 8 or 10 p.m. to finish. "I feel overloaded," she said. "I have not 
had time to do my chores, to feed my dog, to sometimes help make dinner for the 
family."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; UPDATED MODEL OF SPY PLANE UNVEILED; AVIATION: 
THE FIRST THREE OF THE REFITTED U-2 PLANES ARE DISPLAYED BEFORE ROCKETING 
SKYWARD, HEADED FOR BASE NEAR SACRAMENTO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Three reborn U-2 planes, of the type that years ago were hidden in 
governmental secrecy and the upper reaches of the Earth's atmosphere, were 
rolled out Friday onto a stage larger than any mounted by the spy plane's 
namesake rock band. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a crowd well-supplied with earplugs, the ominous flat-black jets let 
loose a blowtorch blast from their new engines, a song that would drown out the 
namesake Irish band's loudest number. 
</P>
<P>
 The three aircraft are the first updated models -- known as the U-2S -- of the 
Cold War's most famous spy plane. And after a morning ceremony in front of a 
Gargantuan hanger at Lockheed Advanced Development Co., the narrow, 
glider-winged aircraft rocketed into the eastern sky, banked back to the west 
and headed for service at Beale Air Force Base near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the old-timers were impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony LeVier, now 81, was the first man to pilot a U-2 back in 1956, when it 
was fueled by common lighter fluid. He last took a spin as co-pilot in a 
two-seat model in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went straight up, to 10,000 feet," he said, still impressed after four 
decades of flying. "There's nothing like it. Nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
 And the U-2S is better, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed in 1954 to fly at more than 70,000 feet -- far out of effective range 
of fighter jets and surface-to-air missiles of the time -- the original U-2 was 
built to photograph military installations in the secrecy-wrapped Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 During its 40 years of service, warfare and reconnaissance changed 
drastically, and the Soviet Union ceased to exist, but the fleet of 37 existing 
Air Force U-2s was still sailing along with ancient Pratt & Whitney J-75 
engines. 
</P>
<P>
 So in recent years, as two or three U-2s were sent to NASA for use in 
environmental research, the Air Force decided to update the power plant in the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 Refitted with General Electric F118-GE-101 engines, the U-2S flies a heavier 
payload than its predecessor, can carry the craft 3,500 feet higher, and can 
travel an extra 3,500 miles before refueling. The engine, 1,200 pounds lighter 
than the Pratt & Whitney model, will also substantially reduce expensive 
operating and maintenance costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The retrofitted version even gets about 15% better fuel usage. Plans call for 
installing the new engines in all military U-2s within four years. 
</P>
<P>
 While the dark ship with wide, thin wings was among the most closely held of 
U.S. intelligence secrets in its early years -- with the military claiming it 
was a weather reconnaissance ship and that the "U" stood for "utility" -- the 
world learned the truth in 1960, when American pilot Francis Gary Powers was 
shot down by an anti-aircraft missile while on a mission 14 miles above the 
Soviet Union and captured alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Soviet officials had long known of the flights, they made no public 
protest while they were powerless to do anything about them. But Soviet Premier 
Nikita S. Khrushchev went into a public fury when Powers' capture was revealed, 
using it to cancel a planned Paris summit meeting with President Dwight D. 
Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
 Powers was sentenced to 10 years in prison, but freed in a swap two years 
later for Soviet master spy Rudolf Abel. By that time, the once-secret plane he 
flew had become a symbol of Cold War espionage and East-West animosities. 
</P>
<P>
 To the 700 or so onlookers Friday morning, however, the plane seemed to be a 
symbol only of aeronautical wonder, long after its mission and its era had 
faded into history. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gen. Tom Griffith, commander of the 12th Air Force, has been flying faster 
than sound for nearly 30 years, but said his first hop in a U-2 last week was 
something to remember. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were up over Oakland and could see the bottom of California," Griffith 
remarked. "You can actually see the curvature of the earth." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked how high he flew the craft, the General squinted and paused. "I 
think all I can tell you is we were above 60,000 feet." He chuckled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well above."

COUNTY SECTION VOTED DOWN; CIF: COUNCIL DEFEATS PROPOSAL TO FORM SEPARATE 
ORANGE COUNTY ATHLETIC CONFERENCE. PROPONENTS PLAN TO REGROUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The State Federated Council voted, 52-48, Friday against a proposal to form an 
Orange County athletic section. 
</P>
<P>
 There were two abstentions and two voters were not in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Superintendents from the county's 15 public high school districts are expected 
to meet next week to regroup, according to Ed Seal, the co-chairman of the 
steering committee created to establish a section. Seal said the 
superintendents will explore other options. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's up to them now," said Seal, who retired as superintendent of the 
Brea-Olinda Unified District last year. "They have to decide whether to let it 
go or take it further." 
</P>
<P>
 Those steps could be drastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal said the most extreme option was for county schools to withdraw from the 
Southern Section and form a section unsanctioned by the state. They would then 
reapply to the State Federated Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The suggestion was made at a meeting of 14 of the county's 15 superintendents 
Friday, but was not discussed at length according to Seal. It would be an 
unprecedented move and could be used as leverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIF is empowered by the State Legislature to run high school athletics in 
the state. Declining admission to an Orange County section, even one created 
without approval, could prompt the legislature to rescind the CIF's right to 
govern, or at least that is the veiled threat Seal is making. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all could end up in the State Legislature," Seal said. "That's a can of 
worms that we don't want to get into. A lot more than an Orange County section 
could be decided if it goes that route." 
</P>
<P>
 The other route would be to bring the issue to the Federated Council again at 
its January meeting. All county officials would need is one of the state 
sections to change its vote. 
</P>
<P>
 A county section proposal was overwhelmingly turned down by the council in 
1992. Friday's vote was considerably closer after two years of preparation by 
county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal, Fountain Valley Principal Gary Ernst and Los Alamitos Principal Carol 
Hart briefed the council on the development and planning of the new section. 
</P>
<P>
 Those plans were jolted earlier in the week when Fullerton superintendent 
Kenneth Jones announced that the six schools in his district would not join an 
Orange County section at this time. But Seal said the Fullerton defection did 
not affect the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 He said money and Southern Section clout defeated the proposal. The Southern 
Section has 26 votes on the council. The Central, North Coast, Northern and 
Oakland sections also voted no. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are financial implications," Seal said. "Another section would mean 
talking state money away from the other sections." 
</P>
<P>
 But the opponents who spoke were concerned more about competitive equity 
within the new section and the desire for the state strategic planning 
committee to complete its work. The committee is expected to look at 
redesigning the state's 10 sections, but has not yet proposed such a move.

 The NFL Management Council and the players' association have agreed on a new 
drug policy, described by the two sides as the most comprehensive in sports. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy expands the testing and discipline components of the previous 
policy by adding a stronger emphasis on education, evaluation and treatment, 
the league and the NFLPA said. 
</P>
<P>
 Any player found to have an alcohol or other drug abuse problem will have an 
opportunity for treatment and recovery but must agree to fully participate in 
the evaluation and treatment prescribed. Failure to do so will result in fines 
or suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new plan, teams would enter players testing positive for drug use 
into a treatment program. If a player tested positive for the substance after 
completing the program, he would be fined three games' pay. A second positive 
test after treatment would result in a four-game fine and a four-week 
suspension. A player would be banished from the league with the possibility of 
reinstatement after one year for a third positive test.

THOSE UNIFORMS ARE NO DISGUISE: IT'S THE PACKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What a special Halloween it will be for football fans. 
</P>
<P>
 They can walk through their neighborhoods Monday night and see ghastly, 
slow-moving creatures with missing brains and hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 Or they can turn on their television sets and see a similar bunch playing the 
Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's holiday is made for the Green Bay Packers, a once-regal franchise 
that hard times have disfigured. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the season, no team has been as disappointing or difficult to 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we turn around, it is like we are shooting ourselves in the foot," 
tackle Ken Ruettgers said. "We have dug ourselves quite a hole." 
</P>
<P>
 So much that booing fans recently forced Coach Mike Holmgren's wife Kathy to 
leave the Lambeau Field stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Those same fans also nearly started a fight in the mezzanine with another 
biased observer -- quarterback Brett Favre's father, Irwin. 
</P>
<P>
 A hole indeed. Here's how deep: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Packers were expected to be mentioned as Super Bowl contenders along 
with the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they are being talked about as if they were the New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
 They are 3-4 with three blown second-half leads, including two that were lost 
in the final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 If they don't win at Chicago on Monday night, they could be in danger of 
missing the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team is full of would-haves, could-haves and should-haves," Ruettgers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Favre was expected to blossom as one of the league's top quarterbacks. 
Instead, he is tied for 15th place with a 78.9 passer rating. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's still like that little girl with a curl," General Manager Ron Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 25 and in his third full season in the league, isn't it time Favre grew 
up? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sterling Sharpe was supposed to pass Jerry Rice as the league's best 
receiver. Instead, six players have caught more passes than Sharpe, and 18 have 
gained more yards receiving. 
</P>
<P>
 And he has become no more of a deep threat than a tight end. In five of the 
Packers' seven games, he hasn't caught a pass longer than 17 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Was that Sharpe screaming at the coaches to call more plays in his direction 
on that recent Thursday night game in Minnesota? Team officials say no, that 
the microphone that picked up his cries had distorted his voice. 
</P>
<P>
 But common sense says that all is not well with a man who would walk out on 
his team the night before the opening game over a contract dispute . . . and 
then spend the first seven games on a pace to catch fewer passes than he has in 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Sterling did at the start was the big distraction to the team," Wolf 
said. "But once he came back, that ended. We have no problem with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe has been hurt not only by his occasional pouting, but by the free-agent 
defection of tight end Jackie Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reggie Cobb, signed as a free agent from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 
off-season, was supposed to give the Packers their first 1,000-yard rusher 
since Terdell Middleton in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he has behaved more like Eddie Lee Ivery. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobb has rushed for 266 yards and one touchdown, with no run longer than 16 
yards. But he also has fewer carries than any of the league's 25 rushers who 
are ranked ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf said the biggest problem with the Packers' 26th-ranked rushing offense is 
the weather. He is still waiting for Packer weather, icy weather, when his 
second-ranked defense can set up a bruising running attack that will feature 
Cobb more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the cold weather comes back, we'll be fine," he said. "We can play our 
kind of game in the cold weather." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Packers can always count on defensive end Reggie White, who is 
having perhaps the finest season of his Hall of Fame career. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe not always. White recently told a reporter that he missed his 
former team in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 "But how can I get back?" he asked the reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning his $9-million bonus, one supposes, would be a start. MONDAY NIGHT 
MADNESS 
</P>
<P>
 In preparation for the first Monday night game on Halloween in six years, 
Barry Krauss offers this warning: 
</P>
<P>
 "Watch out," Krauss said. "Strange things could happen. It will be very 
eerie." 
</P>
<P>
 Krauss would know. He was a linebacker for the Indianapolis Colts when they 
played host to the Denver Broncos in the last Monday night Halloween game in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts were 3-5 at the time. The Broncos were 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans spent early Monday evening at Halloween parties, then filled the Hoosier 
Dome dressed like ghosts and goblins. Some even wore masks of announcers Frank 
Gifford, Dan Dierdorf or Al Michaels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody in the stands was wearing some sort of mask, all screaming and 
howling, all fired up," Krauss said. "I have never seen anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts responded by scoring a team-record 45 points in the first half and 
won, 55-23. 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, Krauss believes that the Broncos were spooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the moment the Broncos stepped on the field, it was like they never had 
a chance," Krauss said. "We knew it. They knew it. When I see guys from that 
game today, we still talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Does this mean that this year's Monday night schedule -- which has given us 
five dogs in eight games -- can be saved? 
</P>
<P>
 Of eight remaining games, five should be winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday -- Packers at Bears. Their 147th meeting since 1921. Will be the 
most-watched game in the league's oldest rivalry. A winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 7 -- New York Giants at Dallas Cowboys. A potential dog, only because the 
Cowboys should score early and often and then rest their stars for the next 
week's showdown in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 14 -- Buffalo Bills at Pittsburgh Steelers. Terrific regional rivalry. 
Will there be more fights in the stands or on the field? A winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 21 -- New York Giants at Houston Oilers. Whoever agreed to give the sorry 
Oilers three Monday night appearances wins the award for most uninformed person 
in the game. A dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 28 -- San Francisco at New Orleans. Bark, bark. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 5 -- Raiders at San Diego Chargers. Other than Winston Moss being forced 
to use an alias on national TV, this is a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 12 -- Kansas City Chiefs at Miami Dolphins. A preview of the first round 
of the playoffs. A winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 19 -- Cowboys at Saints. We aren't even going to ask what ABC was 
thinking about here. A dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 26 -- 49ers at Vikings. Another playoff preview. A winner. REALIGNMENT 
UPDATE 
</P>
<P>
 While the favored realignment proposal reported here remains alive, it is 
facing greater odds every day. 
</P>
<P>
 In preparation for reaching a decision at the owners' meetings in Chicago next 
week, owners are now backing away from their previous stances and hunkering 
down to protect old rivalries and habits. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, get ready for an NFC West that includes two teams that play in 
the Eastern time zone -- Atlanta and Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 And get ready for an AFC Central that contains four teams that play in the 
Eastern time zone -- Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
 According to owner Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys, the Carolina Panthers 
and Jacksonville Jaguars simply will be dropped into those respective 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The owners are now thinking that there is no way you can do anything other 
than just slot the teams," Jones said. "It's just too hard." 
</P>
<P>
 The reasoning: 
</P>
<P>
 -- While some owners have agreed to move, others are unhappy with the results 
of those moves. And for some of the most unusual reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Indianapolis will gladly move from the AFC East to the NFC 
Central, but current NFC Central residents are worried about having three 
division teams playing in domes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ripple effects are just too great," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Owners no longer care that it sounds ludicrous to have, say, a team from 
Charlotte, N.C., in a western division. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do we realign just because it sounds funny to have teams from the East 
playing in the West?" Jones asked. "Of course not. Heck, if that bothers you, 
let's just change the names of the divisions. Call them the red division, or 
blue division." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Owners believe that new rivalries -- one of the projected results of 
realignment -- can be created simply through scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heck, we'll play Houston every year if the schedule-makers will just do it," 
Jones said. "We don't have to be in the same division with them." 
</P>
<P>
 This corner thinks that by not realigning, the NFL will be missing yet another 
chance to update the game for younger fans. 
</P>
<P>
 After heading so far in that direction in recent years by changing rules and 
adding Fox, why stop now? QUICK HITTERS 
</P>
<P>
 * AS GRACIOUS IN DEFEAT AS IN VICTORY: Buddy Ryan was asked about traffic 
accidents involving Dallas' Erik Williams and Shante Carver, which occurred 
just hours after the Cowboys had defeated Ryan's Arizona Cardinals last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, they were wrecked up a little bit before they left here too, weren't 
they?" Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 * LEAVE IT TO BOBBY: While leaving work around 11 p.m. one recent night, San 
Diego Charger Coach Bobby Ross was reminded that the Rolling Stones were giving 
a concert on the stadium field behind his office. So he took a peek. 
</P>
<P>
 "That place was really jumping," Ross said later. "That Mike Jagger was really 
going." 
</P>
<P>
 * HEADS UP: Agent Leigh Steinberg is so concerned with head injuries that he 
is exploring plans to bring his 21 quarterbacks to Newport Beach this spring 
for a seminar and examinations by a neurologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last weekend, quarterbacks Troy Aikman of the Cowboys, Vinny Testaverde 
of the Cleveland Browns and Chris Miller of the Rams suffered concussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, running back Merril Hoge of the Chicago Bears retired after 
suffering four concussions since training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg figures that clients Aikman and Steve Young of the San Francisco 
49ers have suffered at least four concussions each. And he wonders how long 
sufferers would continue to play if they knew of the long-term effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Players in this league know exactly what is inside their knee, but nothing 
about what is inside their head," Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said that the biggest problem is that nobody has researched how 
numerous concussions can affect a player later in life. 
</P>
<P>
 "What effect do all of these things have on strokes? Or senility? Or 
Parkinson's disease?" Steinberg asked. "Somebody has to give the players some 
more information. There are players right now who probably should retire. But 
nobody knows." 
</P>
<P>
 * IT'S ABOUT TIME: In the year of the throwback uniforms, we have finally seen 
a throwback spike. Our thanks to Chris Spielman, Detroit Lion linebacker, who 
last week stripped a ball and returned it 25 yards for a touchdown, his first, 
against the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end zone, Spielman fell to his knees and slammed the ball down with 
both hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my 1905 spike for all the old-timers that played this game," he said. 
"It really was. I said if I ever scored, I was going to go in there like the 
old-timers and throw the ball down in the end zone like they used to do. All 
I'm doing is reviving the true meaning of touch down." 
</P>
<P>
 * MORE UNBELIEVABLE BY THE STEP: Barry Sanders' 84-yard run for the Lions 
against the Bears last week was not his longest in the NFL, but his longest 
with both shoes on.  
</P>
<P>
 His 85-yard run this season against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers was accomplished 
after he had lost his right shoe near the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 * IF SHELL DIDN'T COMPARE HOSTETLER TO JAY SCHROEDER, HE SHOULD HAVE: Enough 
of the jokes that Hostetler was most angry about an alleged comparison to Jay 
Schroeder. They really are quite similar. 
</P>
<P>
 Each is 33 and has been in the league since 1985. Each stands about 6 feet 2 
and weighs about 220 pounds. Each has played in one Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The major difference is that Schroeder has had a far more productive career, 
having thrown for more than twice as many yards and touchdowns as Hoss. 
</P>
<P>
 * GEE, MAYBE WE DON'T DESERVE TWO TEAMS: Figures this week reveal that the 
Raiders and Rams rank 26th and 27th, respectively, in home attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders are drawing an average of 48,756 to the Coliseum, the Rams 41,130 
to Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The only team in worse shape is the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, drawing only 40,055. 
</P>
<P>
 The leading Kansas City Chiefs are averaging 79,522. 
</P>
<P>
 That's impressive, considering that capacity at Arrowhead Stadium is more than 
1,000 less than that figure, 78,067. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE HIGH COST OF LEAVING YOUR FANS IN LIMBO: According to calculations by 
"The Sports Business Daily," the Rams have already dropped $868,170 in total 
home ticket money (before revenue sharing) compared to last season. This 
projects to a $1.6-million deficit by the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one other team in the league, the New Orleans Saints, figure to lose even 
half that much.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; WASHINGTON LOSES JOB, BUT NOT PRESENCE 
</P>

<P>
 Lionel Washington made no attempt to hide his disappointment when he was 
replaced by Albert Lewis at cornerback after the fourth game. Since then, 
however, Washington has played not so much like a reserve as a fifth starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been a consummate pro," Coach Art Shell said. "When the change was made, 
he said that he didn't like it but instead of feeling sorry for himself, he has 
continued to work and has made himself and the team better." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Raiders' victory over Atlanta last week, Washington had two second-half 
interceptions, running his season total to three. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's in store for Tyrone Montgomery? For the first six games, Montgomery was 
the team's starting tailback. Then last Sunday, Harvey Williams got the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams promptly gained 107 yards against the Falcons, and Montgomery did not 
play a down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having a guy like Harvey is tough because he can play every aspect of the 
game," Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Tyrone's case, we really haven't tapped into his talents. He knows that we 
just have to find the right situations to use him in." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery might, in fact, drop deeper on the depth chart. The Raiders have 
been giving Calvin Jones, their third-round draft choice, more repetitions in 
practice. Jones, a speedster from Nebraska, has yet to be activated for a game 
this season.

THE BOTTOM TEN / STEVE HARVEY: OHIO TEAMS ARE SLINKING DOWN THE RIVER

 THE COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a miserable season for O-0-0-0-Ohio. Akron hasn't done Zip this 
season. And neither have Ohio U. or either of the Cincinnatis--the NCAA 
Bearcats or the NFL Bungles. The four misfits have zero victories among them. 
</P>
<P>
 And the state's biggest disappointment lies ahead--Ohio State's annual 
drubbing by Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Akron and Ohio, incidentally, meet Nov. 19 for what could be the Bottom Ten's 
national championship--a true must-lose game. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the University of Kentucky (1-6) has its own problems, having been 
forced to change its sports logo after receiving numerous complaints that the 
wildcat's rolled tongue resembles a penis. Officials said that future Wildcat 
paraphernalia will feature a modified tongue. We wish the same could be said of 
Buddy Ryan. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Rout of the Week: Navy (1-6) over reeling Notre Dame (4-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Note: The Bottom Ten selectors wish to apologize for their previous apology 
for putting Cal in the rankings. The Bears, 0-61 losers to USC, are back where 
they belong, at No. 14. THE PROS 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the Bungles are the worst team in the NFL. But are they the worst in 
North America? No doubt, tens of thousands of fans would put out big money to 
find out. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right--we're talking about a Bottom Ten world championship showdown 
between the most inept representatives of the National and Canadian football 
leagues. That would pit (and that's the right word) the Bungles against 
disoriented Shreveport (2-15), which is located in Louisiana but is a member of 
the CFL. So are Sacramento and Las Vegas. You know the CFL's theme song: "Don't 
Know Much About Geography." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, Bottom Ten officials have been talking with officials of Bottom 
Ten-Canada (aseparately owned Canadian operation), with an eye toward holding 
the big game in an appropriate setting, perhaps Nome, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 And who would be co-grand marshals of the event? How about two worthies who've 
done so much for sports--baseball negotiators Donald Fehr and Richard Ravitch?

NHL STOPS PAYING FOR PLAYERS' HEALTH INSURANCE; HOCKEY: DUCKS' KURVERS LEARNS 
OF THIS AS HIS WIFE IS TREATED FOR INJURIES SUSTAINED IN A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Mighty Duck defenseman Tom Kurvers and his wife, Suzy, who is expecting their 
first child in December, are going to be all right after being struck in a 
head-on collision Thursday night in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 But the second jarring event of the evening came when a hospital worker at 
Kaiser Permanente Medical Center told the couple -- somewhat inaccurately -- 
that their insurance had been "terminated" as of Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL has quit paying health insurance premiums for locked-out players and 
their families, and says it has followed federal law by giving players a 60-day 
notice that they can keep their coverage only if they pay the entire price for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a notification process that one team official admits the league 
bungled, Kurvers and others had not yet received a letter, dated Oct. 18, from 
the insurance carrier. He since has been assured by the NHL Players Assn. he 
will be covered, and was far more concerned about the baby and his wife, who 
has spent two nights at the hospital because she began contractions after the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "She'll be fine and the baby's fine," said Kurvers, who said he was waiting to 
make a turn when they were hit when a car crossed a median. Authorities suspect 
the driver was intoxicated. "Our insurance was terminated on Oct. 15 and I 
found that out at the hospital. I was sitting there with Suzy and they said 
they wanted to make sure I was aware of that. I was a little bit surprised, 
more than surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 NHL spokesman Arthur Pincus said "no player has been without health coverage" 
and called the move "an option that is ours during a work stoppage. We've not 
left anybody without health coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal law known as COBRA allows workers who lose or change their jobs to 
extend their employer health coverage at their expense for up to 18 months, 
with a 60-day window to make a decision without interruption of coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Union chief Bob Goodenow is angry about slow notification after learning of 
the Oct. 15 move only Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They sent the notices by regular mail and they didn't call us," Goodenow 
said. "If they had, we would have sent out bulletins to the players and we 
would have notified the players we will pick up the coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow said the NHLPA will pay players' insurance expenses during the 
lockout -- which would amount to about $600 a month for each player, according 
to an NHL source. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney William Shernoff, a consumer insurance lawyer with the 
Claremont-based firm of Shernoff, Bidart and Darras, said employers typically 
stop paying insurance when a player quits or is fired and said "it sounds like 
hardball negotiating tactics." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow called it "highly irregular." 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows a lack of regard for the employees by not promptly notifying us, the 
association, about the change," he said. "(The league is) going to say he can 
get coverage. But it's the trauma they were put through. It's like what can go 
wrong, would go wrong. It's really an unfortunate situation." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In moves that add up to no foreseeable end to the lockout, an NHL spokesman 
said that more games will be canceled and the NHLPA rejected an offer to look 
into management's books. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Friday, 154 games -- 14.1% of the 1,092-game schedule -- had been 
missed. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the league has canceled only four games from each club's 84-game 
schedule, saying that games might be rescheduled.

THEY'RE KEEPING EVERYTHING IN THE FAMILY; DRAG RACING: SCOTT KALITTA HAS 
FOLLOWED THE TRAIL BLAZED BY HIS FATHER, CONNIE, IN BOTH DRAG RACING AND THE 
AIR-FREIGHT BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It may come as a shock to some race car drivers, who spend every waking moment 
thinking about or working on their cars, but Scott Kalitta, the newly crowned 
top-fuel drag racing champion, considers racing his weekend hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 During the week, Kalitta is president of his own air-freight company, Trans 
Continental Airlines, in Ypsilanti, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 If Kalitta sounds like a familiar name in both drag racing and air-freight 
circles, it should. His father, Connie, started out as the drag racing "Bounty 
Hunter" while barnstorming with Dan Garlits in the 1950s and is still one of 
the sport's top competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 And Connie's company, American International Airways, is the sponsor of his 
and Scott's top-fuel dragsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Connie, 56, has won 10 National Hot Rod Assn. top-fuel events -- three this 
season. Scott, 32, has won six, five this year, and one in a funny car. 
</P>
<P>
 But this season Scott accomplished something his father never has. He won the 
family's only NHRA Winston championship. 
</P>
<P>
 He's not even close in the air-freight business, though. Connie has about 60 
planes, one of the busiest fleets in the world. Scott has two. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last year, the Kalittas tried to run their businesses and the racing 
team all at the same time. It finally became too much work. 
</P>
<P>
 Connie took a year off from racing to concentrate on his airline, and Scott 
who had driven top fuelers for nearly half his life -- he drove his dad's on a 
test run when he was 16 -- with only minimal success, concluded that a 
full-time crew chief would help solve his racing problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick LaHaie, the 1987 Winston top-fuel champion, was the choice and in their 
second season together, Scott won the family's first national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeing the joy and fulfillment in Scott and Connie's faces when he won was 
probably even more satisfying than winning myself," LaHaie said Friday at the 
Pomona Fairplex, where both Kalittas are competing in the Winston Select Finals 
this weekend. "I expected myself to win but when Scott did it, I was able to 
enjoy their excitement in a different way. It really meant a lot to me." 
</P>
<P>
 LaHaie had been luxuriating in semi-retirement in Lansing, Mich., when the 
Kalittas approached him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was enjoying myself, watching talk shows on TV in the morning and doing 
what retired people do the rest of the day," LaHaie said. "I was getting a 
little bored, though, so it didn't take much to talk me into coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 The change was apparent almost immediately. With LaHaie setting up the 
combinations in 1993, Scott was No. 1 qualifier at seven events and although he 
won only one final round, he chased Eddie Hill to the championship until the 
second-last race. He also won the Winston Invitational, a prestigious 
non-points race at Rockingham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 His quarter-mile run of 308.64 m.p.h. last year at Topeka, Kan., was the 
fastest in drag racing history at the time. He came back this season to better 
it with a national record 308.95 during the Keystone Nationals at Reading, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been an exciting year," LaHaie said. "Not only winning the 
championship, but setting the (elapsed time) record of 4.726 seconds at Houston 
and the speed record at Reading, and making nine final rounds." 
</P>
<P>
 And when he returned to racing, Connie, noting the difference LaHaie had made 
with his son's car, hired veteran tuner Tim Richards for his car. Part of 
Richards' crew is Kim LaHaie, Dick's daughter and crew chief when her father 
won his national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kalittas met three times during the season. Scott won at Houston, in the 
fastest race in history, in the semifinals, and at Denver in the second round. 
Connie won in the finals at Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was nice, working closely with Kim, but when the cars lined up side by 
side, they were competitors, pure and simple," LaHaie said. 
</P>
<P>
 The association will come to a close next year, however, as Richards and Kim 
LaHaie are returning to Chuck Etchell's funny car. LaHaie will continue to 
wrench Scott's top fueler, but says he has no thoughts of handling both Kalitta 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "One car is hard enough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott was quick to credit LaHaie for his winning season. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he came, it left me with no responsibilities in the car except to 
drive," he said. "That is my only involvement. Dick works at it 24 hours a day. 
He goes 100% all the time, and it sure paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we got Dick, it seemed like we were always either tearing the car 
apart or tuning it, but we never seemed to have enough time." 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Kalitta won his first national event at Pomona, the 1967 
Winternationals, when Scott was 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started going to the races with my dad when I was 11 or 12," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time I was 14, I was spending every summer with the team. I was always 
wanting to work on the car and once in a while they'd let me polish the wheels. 
I thought that was great." 
</P>
<P>
 Connie Kalitta had never completed high school and he wanted to make sure that 
his son did, so he made Scott a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you graduate from high school, I'll build you a car," Connie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott graduated from Belleville High in Belleville, Mich., in 1980 and when 
the 1981 season opened at Pomona with the Winternationals, the Kalittas were 
there with a pro comp car, an injected nitro dragster that ran about 189 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, not yet 19, surprised even himself by qualifying for final 
eliminations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty impressive, I thought, even though I lost in the first round," 
the younger Kalitta recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he has been to Pomona with one car or another every year, but he 
is still looking for a victory here. 
</P>
<P>
 "This hasn't been a good track for me," he said. "I don't know if I've ever 
made it past the second round. Hopefully, things will change this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Kalittas are in the Budweiser Classic, an eight-car shootout for $50,000 
that will highlight today's program. Scott will race Kenny Bernstein, and 
Connie will race Cory McClenathan in first-round matchups at 11 a.m.

<P>
 John Force of Yorba Linda recorded the first 300-m.p.h. funny car run at the 
Pomona Fairplex during Friday's second round of qualifying for the 30th Winston 
Select Finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Force's 301.40 m.p.h. in a Chevrolet Lumina shattered Jim Epler's year-old 
record of 297.12, and also set an event elapsed-time record of 5.069 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 In top fuel, Kenny Bernstein blistered the quarter-mile at a record 307.06 
m.p.h., bettering Ed McCulloch's mark of 304.05 set last February in the 
Winternationals. Bernstein's 4.754 seconds was also a Winston Select record. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrell Alderman had an event-record 7.096-second run in his Dodge Avenger to 
pace the pro stock class. SHAV GLICK

TITANS UPSET NO. 1 INDIANA IN SOCCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Down to nine men on the field at the final whistle, relying on a backup 
goalkeeper so unprepared to play that he forgot his jersey in the locker room, 
the Cal State Fullerton men's soccer team weathered attrition and the fog 
Friday evening to upset top-ranked Indiana, 3-2, in overtime in the UCLA/adidas 
Met Life Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Soto's penalty kick in the 103rd minute proved the difference as an 
injury depleted Fullerton team held on to stop Indiana's 15-game winning streak 
in front of 1,100 at UCLA's Spaulding Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (10-6-1) played the last 24 minutes of regulation without goalkeeper 
Mike Kornock, who received a red card for hand contact with the ball outside 
the penalty area during a violent collision with Indiana midfielder Craig 
Ginsberg. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans also lost midfielder Joey Franchino, who received his second yellow 
card in the 116th minute, forcing Fullerton to play the last four minutes with 
nine men to Indiana's 10. The Hoosiers had defender Mike Clark sent off with a 
red card in the 83rd minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be a much better coach than me to think we'd beat No. 1 Indiana 
playing down a man," Fullerton Coach Al Mistri said. "To play 10 versus 11 . . 
. is harder than hell against anyone, let alone the top team in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton played the last 54 minutes with reserve goalkeeper Justin Johnston, 
who had not played a minute in the Titans' first 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell of a baptism, eh?" Mistri said. "You want to know how sure he was that 
he wasn't going to play tonight? He left his keeper's jersey in the locker 
room. We had to send him out there in a warm-up jacket." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston held Indiana (16-2) scoreless the rest of the way, denying Brian 
Maisonneuve with a lunging save in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Soto scored the game winner on a penalty after Fullerton midfielder Matt 
Bradbury was taken down in the box by Clark late in the first overtime period. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Rodriguez, in the ninth minute, and Brad Wilson, in the 31st, accounted 
for Fullerton's goals during regulation. Indiana equalized with Maisonneuve's 
header off a free kick in the 14th minute and took a 2-1 lead two minutes later 
on a penalty kick by Clark.

COUNCIL VOTES DOWN PROPOSED NEW SECTION; HIGH SCHOOLS: ORANGE COUNTY GROUP 
EXPECTED TO MEET NEXT WEEK TO PLAN NEXT MOVE, IF ANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The CIF's Federated Council, voting Friday, defeated a proposal to form an 
Orange County athletic section, 52-48. 
</P>
<P>
 There were two abstentions and two voters were not in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Superintendents from the county's 15 public high school districts are expected 
to meet next week to regroup, according to Ed Seal, co-chairman of the steering 
committee created to establish a new section. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's up to them now," said Seal, who retired last year as superintendent of 
the Brea Olinda Unified District. "They have to decide whether to let it go or 
take it further." 
</P>
<P>
 Seal said the most extreme option was for Orange County schools to withdraw 
from the Southern Section and form a section unsanctioned by the state. They 
could then reapply to the Federated Council. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be an unprecedented move but could provide leverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIF is empowered by the State Legislature to run high school athletics in 
California. Declining admission to an Orange County section, even one created 
without approval, could prompt the legislature to rescind the CIF's right to 
govern, or at least that was hinted by Seal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all could end up in the State Legislature," he said. "That's a can of 
worms that we don't want to get into. A lot more than an Orange County section 
could be decided if it goes that route." 
</P>
<P>
 The other route would be to bring the issue to the Federated Council for 
another vote at its January meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 A county section proposal was overwhelmingly turned down by the council in 
1992. Friday's vote was considerably closer.

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; CAPISTRANO VALLEY FALLS SHORT AGAINST 
MATER DEI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mater Dei Coach Bruce Rollinson was expecting a tough game from Capistrano 
Valley. And he got one, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 The 31-3 victory by the second-ranked Monarchs Friday night before about 3,500 
doesn't tell the entire story. Mater Dei (8-0, 3-0) controlled three-quarters 
of the game, but Capistrano Valley had its moments in the second quarter. 
However, the Cougars had only three points to show for three drives inside the 
Mater Dei 35, including one inside the five. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley (4-4, 1-2) was behind, 14-0, because of two touchdown passes 
by John Flynn, but the Cougars began to move the ball and get some breaks early 
in the second quarter. Helped by a 15-yard late-hit penalty on Mater Dei, 
Capistrano Valley reached the Mater Dei 32 before settling for a 49-yard 
field-goal attempt by Brett Thompson on fourth and two. Thompson's kick had the 
distance, but was wide left. Within three minutes, Capistrano Valley was 
threatening again. But on fourth and seven at the Mater Dei 26, Thompson missed 
a 43-yard field goal that was well short. 
</P>
<P>
 After Mater Dei failed to move the ball, Capistrano Valley put together its 
best drive of the night, moving 65 yards in 50 seconds with a short passing 
game led by quarterback Tim Hirchag. But once the Cougars reached the Mater Dei 
four, the wheels came off. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley called a time out but took a delay of game penalty with 
Hirchag standing on the sidelines with Coach Eric Patton. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost track of how much time there was," Patton said. "Our quarterback had 
a little concussion and he kept forgetting the play that was called." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars finally got off a draw play that resulted in one yard, and called 
their last time out with 11 seconds left. Instead of going for the end zone, 
Patton decided to attempt a 25-yard field goal that was good. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a play called, but when we had to take a time out, we lost our chance 
of going for a touchdown," Patton said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Capistrano Valley lost any chance it had of upsetting the Monarchs. From 
there, Mater Dei dominated. The Monarchs' Kevin Braga intercepted a pass from 
Hirchag on the third play of the third quarter and took it 26 yards to the 
Capistrano Valley nine. One play later, Perry caught his second touchdown pass 
of the game, a seven-yarder from Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson tried one more long field goal, a 47-yarder with 5:02 remaining in 
the third quarter, but it was wide right. Mater Dei's Patrick Shinnefield 
kicked a 48-yarder to end the third quarter and Monarch fullback Joey Trampush 
finished the scoring by hitting the end zone on a seven-yard run.

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; SONORA BEATS TROY ON LAST-MINUTE KICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what could prove to be the pivotal game in determining the Freeway League 
champion, Sonora Coach Mark Takkinen proved himself a prophet on nearly every 
account. 
</P>
<P>
 For his Raiders to beat defending champion Troy -- which they did, 17-15, in 
front of a Troy homecoming crowd of about 800 at Fullerton High -- Takkinen 
expected the Warriors to run well but not pass well, but his team to do both. 
He also expected turnovers to have a huge impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Absolutely right. The Warriors rushed (6-2, 2-1) for 314 yards -- 209 by Larry 
Montgomery. He scored every Troy point -- two touchdowns (setting a school 
record with 16 on the year) and a two-point conversion, giving Troy a 
short-lived 15-14 lead with 2:47 left to play. But Warrior quarterback Kevin 
Gray completed only one pass in five attempts, and even that 15-yarder worked 
against him and his team; receiver Jim Wise fumbled at the goal line, the ball 
bounced through the end zone and the Raiders got the ball on a touchback. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile Sonora (5-3, 3-0) had 235 yards rushing -- 137 by Sam Escobar. They 
could also throw; quarterback Kevin Rodriguez, despite two interceptions, 
passed for 125 yards and two first-half touchdowns, both to Mark Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 But Takkinen could not have predicted how the Raiders would score the winning 
points. After taking the lead, Troy tried on on-side kick and recovered the 
ball just short of the 50. By not traveling the required 10 yards, the ball was 
given to the Raiders, who drove down to the Warrior 10 to set up Wes Hale's 
27-yard field goal with 23 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I had it all the way," said Hale, who missed a 50-yard attempt in the 
second quarter. "It was just a regulation kick from that distance." 
</P>
<P>
 Takkinen termed the on-side kick "a great call" by Troy Coach John Turek. "I'm 
just glad it didn't go 10 yards because we were backing away from it." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great game for them. We made too many mistakes," Turek said, 
referring to the fumble and interception that Sonora turned into 14 points in 
the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams came in missing key performers. The Warriors were lacking running 
back Ryl Relatores, whose sprained ankle had not sufficiently healed. 
Replacement Larry Vasquez rushed for 95 yards in 13 carries. Sonora was without 
receiver Junior Rodriguez (broken hand) and lineman Eric Kemmer (broken leg). 
The Raiders did welcome running back Chris Anderson, playing for the first time 
in nearly a month after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery.

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; EDISON WINS PASSING DUEL WITH BARONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Edison needed a victory in the worst way Friday at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two minutes into the second quarter, it looked as if Edison had 
seized what it wanted. Quarterback Pat Markovsky had thrown three touchdown 
passes by then, and it appeared fifth-ranked Edison would soon be back in the 
playoff picture. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fifth-ranked Chargers were facing arch rival Fountain Valley, and 
nothing comes easy in these sorts of games. After weathering a rough third 
quarter, Edison finally held on for a 42-22 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was do or die," Edison Coach Dave White said. 
</P>
<P>
 A loss probably would have ruined the Chargers' playoff hopes. With the 
victory, they scrambled back into contention. Edison is 6-2, 1-2 in Sunset 
League play. Fountain Valley is 4-4, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's last-minute, 15-12, loss to top-ranked Los Alamitos could have 
sent the Chargers reeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sat in the locker room after the game -- 65 kids crying their eyes out," 
White said. "We told them, 'You have until Monday. Then it's Baron week.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, it might have given us confidence. We showed we could play with the 
best team in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 And almost win. 
</P>
<P>
 Showing no ill effects from last week, Markovsky came out firing, hitting Brad 
Lisotto once and Mike Ogas twice for touchdowns and a 21-0 lead with 10 minutes 
39 seconds left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley quarterback Chris Ponchak struggled, misfiring on 12 of 18 
first half passes. He and the Barons would rally in the third quarter, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 35-10, Ponchak quickly threw touchdown passes of 50 yards, to Joey 
Rozek, and 49 yards, to Michael Rumford. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, a 35-22 deficit with 35 seconds left in the third quarter didn't 
look quite so bad. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fountain Valley ran out of gas in the fourth quarter, and Markovsky put 
the game out of reach with a 47-yard touchdown pass to Andy Linnen with 7:20 
left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Ponchak won the duel of quarterbacks, completing 17 of 41 passes 
for 313 yards and three touchdowns. Markovsky completed 14 of 26 for 228 yards. 
His four touchdown passes covered 40, 19, 5 and 47 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley outgained Edison, 348-344. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lotta points scored," White marveled. "You never know. This game is 
unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 He meant the Edison-Fountain Valley series, which has seen a 0-0 tie and now 
this.

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; BREA-OLINDA DEFENSE HOLDS SAVANNA WHEN 
IT COUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Beamer stood on the sideline, watching Brea-Olinda teammate Jerome Owens 
score with 2 minutes 46 seconds left in the game, and worried. 
</P>
<P>
 Beamer, a junior free safety, had seen enough of Savanna quarterback Jeremy 
Klemp to know 2:46 was an eternity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we scored too soon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It might have been, except Beamer wrestled the ball from Lee Myers in midair 
with 33 seconds remaining -- in the end zone -- to seal Brea's 24-20 Orange 
League victory over the seventh-ranked Rebels in front of a homecoming crowd of 
3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 There were seven lead changes -- one with every score -- and nothing was 
certain until Beamer, 5 feet 9, 160 pounds, jumped in front of Klemp's pass.  
</P>
<P>
 It ended a drive that began on Savanna's 18 with 2:40 to go, and was kept 
alive by a fourth-down pass interference penalty against Erik Taylor -- who 
earlier had prevented a touchdown by intercepting a Klemp pass in the end zone 
with 1:38 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Rebels reached the 27 -- converting a third-and-12 situation to 
get there -- Klemp's magic ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 Klemp, who came in as the county's second-rated passer, finished 17 of 21 for 
259 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea's winning drive began with 10:35 left in the fourth quarter and covered 
73 yards and 16 plays, a key one being Jerome Owens' 14-yard draw on a third 
and 10 at the Brea 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens eventually scored from one yard, capping a 197-yard performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we could run the ball if we could be patient," Brea Coach Jon 
Looney said.  
</P>
<P>
 The game of keep-away was successful enough to move Brea into first place in 
the Orange League. The Wildcats are 6-1-1, 2-0-1; Savanna is 6-2, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Klemp threw two second-half touchdown passes, five yards to Dedrick Ennis, and 
48 to Barry Michael. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandwiched in the middle of those two scores was Josh Smith's fumble recovery: 
from the one Owens fumbled into the end zone and Smith, a Brea lineman, pounced 
on the ball for a touchdown, giving the Wildcats a 17-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams marched on the other on the game's first three possessions. Brea 
had a field goal, of 25 yards, by Tommy Prenovost, and then Jerome Owens made 
it 10-7 when he scored from three yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens touchdown capped a nine-play, 69-yard drive that took only 3:05. 
</P>
<P>
 But Savanna's first scoring drive took even less time. The Rebels covered 58 
yards in 1:53. The big play was a 31-yard pass from Jeremy Klemp to Lee Myers, 
and Daven King scored from one yard to give Savanna a brief 7-3 lead. It was 
King's 14th touchdown.

CLIPPERS; ROBERTS HAS SURGERY ON ACHILLES' TENDON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clipper center Stanley Roberts, who suffered a season-ending injury to his 
left Achilles' tendon in Wednesday night's 101-98 exhibition victory over the 
Atlanta Hawks, underwent surgery Friday at Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Osher, who performed the surgery, said Roberts will be sidelined six to 
nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts ballooned to more than 345 pounds after rupturing his right Achilles' 
tendon last December and was out of shape when he reported to training camp 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Coach Bill Fitch thinks Roberts won't repeat his mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's learned his lesson and I think this time his rehab will be better," 
Fitch said. "I think he'll be much a better player a year from now than what we 
would have got this year." CHRIS BAKER

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; SCORECARD / COUNTY HIGHLIGHTS FROM WEEK 
8; A WELCOMED RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was Homecoming for Santa Margarita High, but no one received a better or 
more deserved welcome back than Darren Wedertz. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 6, 1992, Wedertz, then a junior, was severely injured during a junior 
varsity football game. He suffered brain damage and spent two months in a coma. 
Exactly one year later he returned home from the Children's Hospital of Orange 
County and on Friday, made his second appearance at an Eagles football game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's doing so much better," said his mother, Charlene. "He can walk with a 
cane now and he wants to walk by Christmas. That might be a little soon but his 
goal is to go (snow) skiing." 
</P>
<P>
 Darren said during the game he wished he could play football again but was 
happy to be back on the sidelines. FIGHT FOR YOUR RIGHT TO PARTY 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica's cheerleaders need to figure out what means more, the Beastie Boys 
or their football team. 
</P>
<P>
 The cheerleaders had a nifty dance routine choreographed to a medley by that 
raucous New York hip-hop trio, and they trotted it out at the end of the first 
quarter. But the routine kept going, and going, and going. Meanwhile, Covina 
Northview was driving as the second quarter began. 
</P>
<P>
 So while "Girls" played in the background, Northview's Dalano Rhyne carried 
for 11 yards to the Pacifica three. Then, "Brass Monkey" was blaring as Rhyne 
carried to the one. Finally, Nathan Romero scored during "Hold It Now," cutting 
Pacifica's lead to 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica won the game, 34-14. ON THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
 "People came down here again to watch us lose . . . but we're still here." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tony Hartley, Los Alamitos wide receiver, after the Griffins defeated 
Esperanza, 35-32, in front of 10,000 fans at Long Beach Veterans Stadium 
Thursday. The victory extended Los Alamitos' unbeaten streak to 43 games. 
LOOKING AHEAD 
</P>
<P>
 The playoff picture should begin to solidify next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon plays Villa Park Thursday at El Modena High in a game that could decide 
second place in the Century League. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy defends its hold on first place in the Empire League Thursday, when 
the Fighting Irish play host to El Dorado at Western High. 
</P>
<P>
 The inaugural Golden West League title is up for grabs Friday night at Cal 
State Fullerton, where Servite plays host to Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Woodbridge has been mathematically eliminated from the title hunt in the 
Sea View League, where, as usual, every game figures to be key this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley still has a shot -- albeit a very long one -- at the Sunset 
League title; however, the Barons end with No. 1 Los Alamitos on Thursday and 
Esperanza the following week. A FOND FAREWELL 
</P>
<P>
 After the game against Sonora Friday, Troy Coach John Turek caught a 1:15 a.m. 
flight to Texas to attend Parents Day at Baylor, where his daughter, Lindsay, 
attends. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about Turek's departure, Troy defensive coordinator Dane Ilertsen said, 
"It should make for a long day for John, depending how the game goes. . . . but 
it will be fun for us (coaches and players) when we watch the game films 
Saturday without him." A JUMP START 
</P>
<P>
 The start of the Ocean View-Santa Ana game was delayed 15 minutes Friday. The 
Saints' team bus was held up in a police barricade around a drive-by shooting 
en route to Friday's game at Huntington Beach High. ON THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, Savanna is the team to beat. And if we can beat the team to 
beat, that makes us the team to beat." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jon Looney, Brea-Olinda coach, commenting before his Wildcats' 24-20 
victory Friday. HOW TOP 10 FARED

NEWSWIRE: ALTERNATIVE LEAGUE SET TO UNVEIL PLANS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Organizers of the United Baseball League, drafted as an alternative to the 
American and National leagues, have scheduled a news conference in New York for 
Tuesday to unveil their plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Player agent Dick Moss, the principal organizer, declined comment on Friday, 
but sources close to the operation said it now appears likely that a realistic 
starting date is 1996, not '95, when the American and National leagues might 
still be shut down by the players' strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll try for '95, but it's going to be difficult," a source said in 
reference to organizing complications. "The original plan called for '96 all 
along." 
</P>
<P>
 The American and National leagues have not been challenged by an alternative 
league since the Federal League opened in 1914 and shut down a year later. ROSS

USC FRESHMAN WASHINGTON SET TO RETAKE ENTRANCE EXAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Delon Washington, the USC freshman tailback whose college entrance exam score 
was challenged last month, is expected to retake the test within a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, who gained 109 yards in the Trojans' season-opening 24-17 victory 
over Washington, was given time to prepare before retaking the American College 
Testing (ACT) exam, a source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's score was challenged by the ACT because of an unusual increase 
between his first and second test scores. USC officials declared him ineligible 
to play until the situation was resolved.

<P>
 Washington's score on his upcoming test will determine whether the result he 
achieved to certify freshman eligibility will be validated. If not, he will be 
ineligible for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington said he would not discuss the situation until it is concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington has practiced with the team sporadically but has not played since 
the second game of the season against Penn State. ELLIOTT ALMOND and EARL

ATTORNEY HELPS TROUBLED TROJANS; JURISPRUDENCE: MICHAEL C. CARNEY SAYS PLAYERS 
DON'T GET FAVORS THAT ARE UNAVAILABLE TO NON-ATHLETES AT USC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael C. Carney's allegiance will be torn when USC plays Notre Dame on Nov. 
26 at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 As a lifelong Irish fan, Carney usually roots for Notre Dame. But in the last 
four years, he has become a friend of Trojan football players who run afoul of 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Carney is the Los Angeles defense attorney USC football players have been 
turning to since he represented former Trojan Jason Oliver in a misdemeanor 
sexual battery case in 1991. Oliver and teammates Willie McGinest and Michael 
Jones were found not guilty by a Los Angeles Municipal Court jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Carney also represented receiver Keyshawn Johnson, whose theft case was 
dismissed in Van Nuys Municipal Court this week when prosecutors were unable to 
find the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 And the lawyer is representing cornerback Jessie Davis, who has a pretrial 
hearing scheduled in November involving charges of battery and hit-and-run with 
injury. Davis has pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Carney, chairman of the California State Advisory Committee to the U.S. 
Commission on Civil Rights, has represented other Trojan players whose criminal 
cases were dismissed. And he handled one player's civil suit. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sports fan, he enjoys mingling with athletes and coaches such as Larry 
Smith and John Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he is careful not to let his support affect his work. After the 
Oliver case, a Pacific 10 Conference official inquired as to how the players 
paid their legal fees. The inquiry involved questions of a possible violation 
of the NCAA's extra-benefit rule, which states that athletes cannot receive 
favors by an institution employee or representative that are not available to 
all of the school's students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't treat these guys any differently than anybody else," Carney said, 
adding that he has represented other USC students. 
</P>
<P>
 Carney said he is not associated with the school as a season-ticket holder or 
booster. His daughter attended USC for two years, and a high school friend, 
Xavier Suazo, a special agent with the California Department of Justice, worked 
game-day security for the Trojans for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Suazo contacted Carney in the spring of 1991 about representing Oliver. Carney 
said he agreed to take the case as long as Oliver could pay.  
</P>
<P>
 But when Oliver's father died shortly after his mother's death, Carney devised 
a payment plan to ease the pressure. He said he does that for clients who have 
financial hardships. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids get a bill," Carney said. "I tell them I realize they are not 
working. I have the understanding that when (they) can get a couple bucks, 
(they) pay me." 
</P>
<P>
 Carney banks on the fact that when the players graduate, they will be 
gainfully employed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been stiffed for a lot of money over my 18 years in private practice," 
he said. "I'm not in this as a charitable institution. It may sound like it 
ends up that way sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Colleagues said Carney's compassion for youth fuels his willingness to help. 
He has three sons, besides his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know he will go out on a limb to help somebody," said Alex Kessel, who 
represented McGinest in the sexual battery trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Carney's reputation at USC has spread since that case. 
</P>
<P>
 He was contacted to help UCLA's Jamir Miller, the linebacker who was charged 
with receiving stolen goods. Miller eventually chose another attorney. Carney 
received another inquiry about a UCLA athlete but was too busy to handle it. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he represented a Cerritos College football player once, but would not 
identify him. He also has turned down a number of Trojan football players 
because their cases were either too far away or were so minor -- traffic 
violations -- that they didn't warrant his time. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the most part the stuff has been nickel and dime," he said of his USC 
cases. "(There have been) only three substantial items I've been involved in." 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of L.A.'s Loyola High, Carney attended Loyola University, then San 
Fernando College of Law. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked as a bailiff during law school, then joined the L.A. County District 
Attorney's office once he passed the bar examination. He left the district 
attorney's office in the mid-'70s and has worked privately since.

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; IBARRA SCORES TWICE, WESTMINSTER 
DOMINATES WINLESS TUSTIN, 27-7 
</P>

<P>
 Westminster running back Leonard Ibarra scored two touchdowns and rushed for 
101 yards as the Lions defeated winless Tustin, 27-7, in a Golden West League 
game Friday night at Tustin High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions scored on the first drive of the game, as Ibarra capped a nine-play, 
62-yard drive with a six-yard run into the end zone.On the ensuing kickoff, 
Tustin (0-8, 0-3) fumbled, indicative of a difficult night during a difficult 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster (6-2, 3-0) recovered the fumble and, four plays later, Lions' 
quarterback Jerry Allison kept the ball on an option and ran in for a two-yard 
score. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster dominated the first half, giving up only 49 yards rushing and 32 
yards passing, and forced five turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tillers showed life in the second half, as quarterback Kevin Timone 
marched his team 65 yards downfield. With first and goal at the six-yard line, 
Timone was hit in the backfield by linebacker Heath Wilcox, forcing a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tustin's next two possessions, Timone fumbled and was sacked on fourth 
down, thwarting both drives, taking the life out of the Tillers' offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin finally got in the end zone with 8 minutes 54 seconds left in the game, 
when Timone hit receiver Pierre Sanjurjo for an eight-yard touchdown pass. The 
drive was sparked by Tiller running back Greg Carnal's 65-yard run on a Tiller 
double reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster sealed the game with 2:45 left, when Ibarra scored on a 26-yard 
run for the game's last score. MICHAEL LYNCH

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; STREAK ENDS AT 36 AS OCEAN VIEW BEATS 
SANTA ANA 
</P>

<P>
 Ocean View has a new streak . . . and this one it wants to protect. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks ended the state's longest losing streak at 36 games with a 20-12 
Golden West League victory over Santa Ana Friday night at Huntington Beach 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 "People forget that this team was only 0-7 before tonight," Seahawk Coach John 
Donnelly said. "They felt the pressure of being 0-36, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View rode the back of Calvin Silva, who ran for three touchdowns en 
route to 107 rushing yards in 16 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to give all the credit to my line," said Silva, the Seahawks' first 
100-yard rusher this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View (1-7, 1-2 in league) started the scoring, taking its second drive 
37 yards in four plays, capped by Silva's one-yard run with 6 minutes 32 
seconds remaining in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana (1-7, 1-2) battled back to take the lead by halftime, as Carlos 
Rodriguez ran one yard for the Saints' first score. Carlos Esparza then 
followed with an 89-yard interception return for a touchdown before the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View dominated the third quarter, notching four first downs after 
earning just two in the entire first half. Silva ran three yards for his second 
touchdown to put the Seahawks ahead, 14-12. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints made it interesting on their last drive, as they drove to the 
Seahawk three-yard line before a Jared DeLachica interception sealed Ocean 
View's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best feeling I have ever had in my entire life," linebacker Mike 
Ketcham said after his two quarterback sacks led the Seahawk defense. MATT

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; ORANGE LEAGUE; WESTERN REMAINS UNBEATEN 
BY RALLYING PAST ANAHEIM

<P>
 Western stayed on the short list of unbeaten football teams in Orange County 
with a 21-17 Orange League victory over Anaheim Friday at Western High. 
</P>
<P>
 Western (7-0-1, 2-0-1 in league) joins Mater Dei, Los Alamitos and Newport 
Harbor as the only teams without a loss, while moving into a first-place tie 
with Brea-Olinda in league. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pioneers found themselves on the brink of defeat after Anaheim's Tony 
Vasquez kicked a 22-yard field goal with 3 minutes 41 seconds left in the game 
to give the Colonists a 17-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Western countered with its biggest play of the game. Dean Chambers 
hit Justin Starkey on a 64-yard pass to the Anaheim 16. Two plays later, Josh 
Burdett run nine yards up the middle for the go-ahead touchdown with 2:43 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim (5-2-1, 0-2-1) was then stopped on fourth down at midfield ensuring 
the Pioneers' homecoming victory, 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time we were undefeated this late in the year was 1984 and we lost 
right here to Anaheim," Western Coach Jim Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Western took a 7-0 lead early in the second quarter when David Bell caught a 
12-yard touchdown pass after the throw was deflected by an Anaheim defender. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdett added to the lead when he bulled through three tackles and ran 30 
yards for a score with 4:12 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Reuben Droughns, who sat out the first series because of a lingering illness, 
got the Anaheim offense rolling when he crisscrossed the field for a 53-yard 
gain. Two plays later, he broke through the defense for a 19-yard touchdown run 
making it 14-7 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim got even with a 16-play, 80-yard drive to open the second half, 
culminated with a Rudy Herrera to Mike Slach seven-yard scoring pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Droughns finished with 182 yards in 30 carries.

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; BEDARD'S 302 YARDS, 4 SCORES LEAD 
SERVITE BY SADDLEBACK 
</P>

<P>
 David Bedard gained 302 all-purpose yards and scored four touchdowns to lead 
host Servite to a 47-21 victory over Saddleback in a Golden West League 
football game Friday at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The amazing thing about Bedard's evening was that it could have been a lot 
better.Two Servite penalties nullified touchdown runs of 73 and 48 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Both offenses started quickly. Bedard's 51-yard touchdown run on the game's 
third play gave the Friars (6-2, 3-0) a 6-0 lead.  
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback (2-6, 0-3) wasted no time on the next drive. Quarterback Danny 
Rodriguez connected with Hector Hernandez on a 55-yard touchdown pass on the 
Roadrunners' first play. Joseph Meza's extra point give Saddleback a 7-6 lead 
with 10 minutes left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite's next drive ended a four-play, 55-yard drive with a three-yard 
touchdown by Bedard, giving the Friars a 12-7 lead, a lead they would not lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite's next score came on a 99-yard punt return by Bedard. In the first 
half, Bedard had 229 of his 302 all-purpose yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedard was not the only successful Friar running back. Marvin Smith rushed for 
95 yards in 14 carries and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez was 10 for 24 for 151 yards and two touchdowns and Danny Varino 
rushed for 52 yards in 14 carries to lead Saddleback. TONY ALTOBELLI

ON THE SPOT, WESTLAKE ESCAPES SIMI VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There were plenty of hugs and smiles passed around at Simi Valley High's 
homecoming Friday night, but there were also tears of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pioneers seemed within striking distance of upsetting Westlake, the No. 
3-ranked team in The Times' Valley poll, before losing the Marmonte League 
game, 17-3. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was a bitter homecoming. Simi Valley quarterback Tim Bennett ran five 
yards to the goal line and appeared to cross it as he was tackled. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball was spotted on the one and the Pioneers fumbled it away on the next 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of being tied, 10-10, the Pioneers trailed by a touchdown with 36 
seconds left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth quarter, Westlake quarterback Scott Spruill turned the ball over 
twice, on an interception and on a fumble while being sacked. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley (5-2-1, 3-2) got the ball on the Westlake 37-yard line on the 
latter turnover, a sack by Brian Kavanaugh and the recovery by Sean Ginnever. 
But two plays later Westlake linebacker Eric Guenther intercepted Bennett's 
pass and rambled 45 yards to the 14. 
</P>
<P>
 On first down for Westlake (7-1, 5-0), Jason Victor ran for a touchdown on a 
broken play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors, who led, 10-0, at halftime, finally put the game out of reach on 
Victor's touchdown with 3:01 left. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a dogfight," said Guenther, a 6-foot-3 senior who previously dropped 
two interceptions on consecutive plays. "We just came up with the big play. I 
tipped the ball on the interception, and I'm glad it bounced back in my hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake, with the two turnovers and 18 penalties for 183 yards, was flirting 
with disaster and it looked like Bennett would give the Warriors their due when 
he ran to the goal line, helmet, shoulder pads and ball appearing to cross. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was in," Bennett said. "The ball was across. (On the next play we 
fumbled because) one of their defensive linemen yelled and the center thought 
it was my cadence. He snapped it early. We beat ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The first half was a defensive slugfest for all but the final four seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Spruill threw a bullet to the corner of the end zone for Billy 
Miller (six receptions, 100 yards), who leaped over David Martinez and Matt 
Guzzo for a 29-yard touchdown. That and a 26-yard field goal by Paul Watson 
with 5:41 left in the half gave Westlake a 10-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, the area's top receiver, was covered like a blanket by Robert Gonzalez 
until the touchdown. Two big hits by Gonzalez broke up completions and dazed 
the 6-foot-4, 210-pound senior, who caught three passes for 39 yards in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Spruill (14 of 28 for 176 yards) threw five consecutive incomplete passes and 
was often forced to scramble by the Pioneer front four of Matt Rezinas, Justin 
Thomas, John Slaby and Chris Campagna, who had plenty of help from blitzing 
linebackers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bennett (12 of 31 for 107 yards) had his own troubles, having three passes 
batted down by Warrior linemen and a possible touchdown pass dropped by 
Gonzalez at the 12. He also overthrew some open receivers.

OXX PULLS RESEDA TO VICTORY; FOOTBALL: SENIOR GAINS 226 YARDS IN 18 CARRIES TO 
LEAD REGENTS PAST VAN NUYS, 15-14. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There was no yoke around the neck of Reseda's Michael Oxx Friday night as the 
senior tailback rushed for 226 yards in 18 carries to lead the Regents to a 
15-14 Pac-8 victory over Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say enough about Michael, he makes all the right decisions," said 
Reseda Coach Joel Schaeffer. "I tell him, 'The first 10 yards are mine to call, 
after that you can do what you want.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Schaeffer wanted to kick a 22-yard field goal early in the first quarter, but 
successive offside penalties against Reseda pushed the ball back to the Reseda 
14 before Allonso Arreola's kick was blocked by Duke Kim. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys took a 7-0 lead midway through the second quarter when quarterback 
Chris Byfield rolled right and threw a touchdown pass to Walter Aleman. 
</P>
<P>
 Seconds later, Oxx scored on an 80-yard run down the left sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were adjusting to me and lining a guy up over me, but we ran the sweep 
anyway," Oxx said. "I didn't think I was going all the way but then I saw a 
little crack up ahead and went for it." 
</P>
<P>
 The scoreboard had barely accounted for Oxx's run when Byfield struck again 
from deep in his own territory. He sprinted left, then weaved his way through 
traffic and down the sideline for a touchdown to give Van Nuys a 14-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda got a 22-yard field goal from Arreola to pull to within 14-9, then 
seized the lead for good on a four-yard touchdown pass from Matt Rutter to Tony 
De La Torre. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys made a bid for the victory by driving to the Reseda 31 with 1:31 to 
play, but Federico Arroyo's 48-yard field-goal attempt sailed wide left after a 
high snap to holder Gilbert Casillas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, was I nervous when (Arroyo) lined up for that kick," Schaeffer said. 
"I've never rooted for anyone to miss a kick so hard in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda's Rutter completed four of eight passes for 77 yards. Byfield completed 
nine of 16 for 75 yards. Each quarterback threw a touchdown and an 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys' John McPherson gained 54 yards in 14 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda's Charles Shells gained 67 yards in 10 carries.

O'DOHERTY A REAL KICK; SENIOR LEADS THOUSAND OAKS TO VICTORY

<P>
 Eleazar Hernandez's reign as the premier cross-country runner in the state 
lasted for all of six days, thanks to Keith O'Doherty of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, a senior at Camarillo High, had defeated a talent-laden field to 
win the team sweepstakes race of the prestigious Mt. San Antonio College 
Invitational on Oct. 22. But O'Doherty outkicked him to win the Ventura County 
championship at Lake Casitas on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Doherty timed 15 minutes 4 seconds over the three-mile distance to edge 
Hernandez by two seconds and lower the course record by four seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier Ramirez of Nordhoff, who had set the course record in last month's Ojai 
Invitational, placed third in 15:25. Jeff Fischer of Thousand Oaks and 
Francisco Sandoval of Channel Islands finished fourth and fifth, respectively, 
in 15:30 and 15:31. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks, the No. 5-ranked team in The Harrier magazine's national poll, 
placed five runners among the top nine finishers to win its third consecutive 
title. The Lancers totaled 28 points, followed by Camarillo (61), Nordhoff 
(110), Channel Islands (140) and Agoura (155). 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura was without No. 1 runner John Greene, who did not compete because of a 
sore knee. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Doherty entered Friday's race with an 0-3 record against Hernandez this 
season, and with a half-mile remaining, it looked as though he would be 0-4.  
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez opened a small lead on his rival as they ascended the final hill and 
even O'Doherty envisioned Hernandez putting him away. 
</P>
<P>
 His thoughts quickly changed, however, as he reeled Hernandez in near the top 
of the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit the hill and just popped up it and it was then that I realized that I 
was a lot closer to him than I expected," O'Doherty said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Doherty took the lead as he made the turn into the final straightaway and 
held it to end Hernandez's six-race winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really have much of a kick, but I guess a lot of your kick is in your 
head," O'Doherty said. "It's all psychological. If you're willing to push it at 
the end of a race, you've got a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 The manner in which O'Doherty won was a pleasant surprise to Thousand Oaks 
Coach Jack Farrell, who said earlier this week that O'Doherty had to break away 
from Hernandez before the final half-mile if he wanted to beat him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shows you what I know," Farrell said. "Keith told me afterward that he felt 
like he could have shifted to another gear if he had had to. We didn't know 
Keith had gears until today." 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Skieresz of Agoura and Thousand Oaks' team were predictable winners in the 
girls' race, but the early battle for the individual title produced a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordhoff freshman Elaine Canchola had a 20-meter lead on Skieresz after the 
first half-mile and did not surrender the lead until after the pair had passed 
the one-mile mark in 5:49. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't worry about her at the start," Skieresz said. "I didn't know who she 
was, but when she still had a big lead heading to the mile, I figured I'd 
better catch her." 
</P>
<P>
 Once Skieresz did that, the race for first was over. 
</P>
<P>
 She had a 30-second lead on Canchola and Kim Mortensen of Thousand Oaks at the 
two-mile mark before winning her third consecutive county title. 
</P>
<P>
 Her time of 17:48 lowered her course record by five seconds and helped ease 
the disappointment of the "worst race" of her career in last week's Mt. SAC 
Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 Skieresz was undefeated entering Mt. SAC, but finished third (18:15) in the 
individual sweepstakes race, 77 seconds behind Santa Rosa sophomore Julia 
Stamps, who set a course record of 16:58. 
</P>
<P>
 "My total focus was on (Stamps) and when I fell behind her, I just lost it 
mentally," Skieresz said. "I just gave up. . . . I wasn't worried about (my 
time) today. I just wanted to run a good, hard race." 
</P>
<P>
 Mortensen (18:23) and Canchola (18:32) finished second and third behind 
Skieresz. Amy Van Atta (19:23) of Buena and Bridget Roy (19:25) of Thousand 
Oaks rounded out the top five. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks, the 15th-ranked team in the nation, placed five runners among 
the top 11 finishers to total 34 points and win its first title since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura, the seven-time defending champion, was second with 92, followed by 
Nordhoff (93), Simi Valley (106) and Buena (115).

HILTON GROWS ON GLENDALE COACHES; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: PINT-SIZED AS A HIGH SCHOOL 
PLAYER, RECEIVER MAKES BIG IMPACT FOR VAQUEROS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The transformation of Tim Hilton caught many people by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember telling (assistant) coaches, 'You've got to see this guy,' " said 
John Cicuto, the Glendale College football coach. "It was like a different 
person." 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, when Cicuto first saw him, Hilton was a scrawny Glendale High 
wide receiver with big ideas about playing in college. But at 5 feet 6 and 
about 130 pounds, Hilton was too small to make Cicuto's team in his first 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking a circuitous route, Hilton transferred to Glendale from Cal 
Lutheran and landed a spot in the lineup. It was no contest this time. The 
short and skinny kid had turned into a taller and more muscular man with 
blazing speed to boot. 
</P>
<P>
 Step right up, young man. What jersey number would you like? Three? Consider 
it yours.  
</P>
<P>
 That's one of the numbers the Moorpark defense will try to contain today at 1 
when the Raiders (4-2) meet Glendale (4-2) in a crucial Western State 
Conference North Division game at Glendale High. 
</P>
<P>
 But it won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton, now 5-10 and 180 pounds, ranks sixth in the conference in all-purpose 
rushing with 749 yards. Although primarily a receiver who has 19 catches for 
354 yards, Hilton is the team's top kickoff and punt returner with 355 yards, 
and runs the ball occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, in a 38-6 victory over Ventura, Hilton returned four kickoffs for 
175 yards, including one for a 78-yard touchdown. He also scored on a 44-yard 
pass from quarterback Eddie Michel and now has four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother (Scott) told me he would give me $100 if I broke a kickoff for a 
touchdown," Hilton said. "He just paid up." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time, however, when some people probably thought Hilton, 20, 
wouldn't be worth a dime as a football player after high school. 
</P>
<P>
 They looked at his size, shook their heads and dismissed his plan. But they 
forgot to consider his determination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always had confidence in myself," said Hilton, a born-again Christian 
who says his faith helps him overcome obstacles. "I love football and I knew I 
could play." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if it wasn't with kids his age. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his size, Hilton usually played youth football in lower divisions 
while his friends played in the higher levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of her son being injured always worried Hilton's mother, Suzy 
Phillips, but she encouraged him to play. She wanted him involved in football 
not only for the sport but to have Hilton around male role models because his 
father had died when he was 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a single parent, I always thought sports were important for the boys," 
said Phillips, who recently remarried. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports definitely were important for Hilton at Glendale High, where he was a 
receiver and, amazingly, an outside linebacker in his senior season in 1990. 
That was only one year after tipping the scales at 117 pounds. Hilton never 
held back because of his size. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe he's the only guy who has had two Knockout awards (for hard hits) 
when I coached the team," said Don Shoemaker, Hilton's coach at Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 "His two hits stand out in my mind. In both cases he was blocking for (running 
back) Pathon Rucker. One was against Muir. We had thrown a pass for Pathon over 
the middle. Tim put a tremendous hit on the free safety. After the game, 
everyone was talking about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Other times, although not many, Hilton got his brain waves short-circuited. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember when the freshman team was playing against Alhambra one day, and I 
was hit so hard that I just went flying," Hilton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Alhambra players) were pretty excited. One of our guys was yelling at 
them that it was no big deal, that I was the smallest guy on the field. 
Actually, I probably gained about five yards from the hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton said opponents frequently tried -- and sometimes still do -- to rattle 
him with trash talk about his size. But he prefers to burn them on the field 
with his quickness rather than with words. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were plenty of teams that would mouth off," Hilton said. "Being a 
Christian helps me to control myself." 
</P>
<P>
 After high school, Hilton wanted to attend Cal Lutheran but could not get 
financial aid in time and opted for Glendale.  
</P>
<P>
 He redshirted that season and devoted the time to start an intense 
weightlifting program that gradually bulked him up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw a kid who had one of the biggest hearts on the team, but he was so 
small," recalled Cicuto. "There was never a question about his desire or work 
ethic." 
</P>
<P>
 The next season, Hilton transferred to Cal Lutheran but broke his left ankle 
in a pickup basketball game during the summer and was sidelined for 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 He played for the Kingsmen last season as a redshirt freshman and had 19 
receptions for 327 yards and four touchdowns.  
</P>
<P>
 But last spring, Hilton couldn't get the classes he wanted at Cal Lutheran and 
transferred to Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 It was time to pay Cicuto another visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he came back, he was so much bigger and stronger," Cicuto said. "We 
didn't know where his speed was, but we found out he is a legit speed kid (4.5 
seconds in the 40 yards) who can go vertical. He makes the catches that have to 
be made." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is reason enough for the coach to ask people to look at the kid now.

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; NEWPORT HARBOR'S DEFENSE BUCKLES DOWN, 
SHUTS OUT WOODBRIDGE

<P>
 Newport Harbor's defense spoiled Woodbridge's homecoming and its chances for 
an automatic playoff bid Friday night by shutting out the Warriors, 24-0.  
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors (8-0, 3-0) held Woodbridge (5-3, 0-3 in the Sea View League) to 35 
yards total offense -- one yard rushing. Newport Harbor has held league 
opponents to 13 points this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors' defensive linemen pressured Warrior quarterback Casey Harris all 
night. Jack Hogan, Bill Johns, John Ryan and Grant Lewan combined for four 
sacks and a loss of 31 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense played really well tonight," Sailor Coach Jeff Brinkley said. 
"The kids want to win the league championship and they knew if we won tonight 
it would put us in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 After Sailor quarterback John Giordani had a pass intercepted on the second 
play of the game, the Warriors got the ball on Newport Harbor's 15-yard line. 
But seven plays later, nd Nathan Bennett missed a 20-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the only break Newport Harbor, ranked fourth in the county, needed. 
On its ensuing possession, senior running back Brian Johnson rushed four times 
and caught one pass in taking the team 80 yards in five plays. He scored on a 
58-yard touchdown run with 5 minutes and 11 seconds remaining in the first for 
a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson finished the game with 14 carries for 112 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors failed to get a first down the rest of the half.  
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor defensive back Scott Sandstrom blocked Jason Chapple's punt at 
the end of the first quarter and halfback Edon Kagasoff gave the Sailors a 14-0 
lead on a two-yard run with 10:26 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors scored their final touchdown on Johnson's 10-yard run with 5:35 
remaining in the half. Kicker Jeff Pardy added a 36-yard field goal in the 
third for the final score.

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; CORONA DEL MAR BOUNCES BACK AGAINST 
EAGLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The question before the game was: After last week's heart-breaking loss to 
Newport Harbor, could Corona del Mar bounce back and stay in the Sea View 
League playoff race against Santa Margarita? 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Kings answered that in a hurry, scoring on two of their first three 
drives, then letting the defense do the rest in a 21-12 victory before a crowd 
of 1,000 at Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar (4-4 overall, 2-1 in league) led, 21-0, after three quarters on 
touchdown runs of one, one and 12 yards by Brian Hogan. The senior running back 
carried 31 times for 187 yards, the longest a 58-yarder that set up his second 
score. But he had to be helped off the field with under two minutes remaining 
with a severely sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Sea Kings Coach Mark Schuster said he wouldn't know how serious Hogan's injury 
was until today.  
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar crossed up Santa Margarita by coming out and throwing the ball. 
Josh Walz threw for 25 of his 28 yards in the first two series. But they 
quickly reverted to the patent running game behind Hogan and J.J. Di Cesare. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we had to establish in our minds and theirs that we could (throw the 
ball)," Schuster said. "We feel we're capable of throwing the ball, but we're 
going to run the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles (4-4, 1-2) could get nothing going offensively in the first half 
with 23 net yards. (Corona del Mar had 128.) They didn't score until 8:22 was 
left in the game on a two-yard run by Billy Newman, who three minutes later, 
scored from the one after the Eagles recovered a fumble on the Sea King 34. 
</P>
<P>
 But two missed extra point attempts and a missed field goal from 35 yards left 
the Eagles nine points short as the Sea Kings ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar outgained the Eagles in total yardage, 249-158. Chris Collins 
threw for 111 yards.

SANTA ANITA; KINGDOM FOUND MOVES TO HEAD OF WEAKER FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Any pain the people behind the California Cup feel because of the absence of 
four marquee names today at Santa Anita might last only a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Pal, Bertrando, Megan's Interco and Soviet Problem, all of whom would 
have added immensely to the nine-race, $1-million extravaganza limited to 
horses bred in California, have a chance to distinguish themselves in Breeders' 
Cup XI next Saturday at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly supplemented by owners John and Betty Mabee for $360,000 to the 
Breeders' Cup Classic, Best Pal's best would make him a strong contender in the 
weakest $3-million race in history. The same goes for Bertrando, another 
supplementary entry, who would move up even more if the track was to come up 
muddy. Megan's Interco is a legitimate threat to upset Lure in the Mile and 
Soviet Problem, who was supplemented for $120,000, may knock off the boys in 
the Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
 Success by any one of the four would be a huge boon to the California 
thoroughbred industry and would also mark a first. In the 10 previous Breeders' 
Cups, California breds have gone 0 for 31. 
</P>
<P>
 With Bertrando and Best Pal missing, Kingdom Found is the 6-5 favorite in 
today's richest race, the $250,000 Classic. Owned by Ray Dilbeck and trained by 
Gary Jones, the 4-year-old son of The Bart has won five races at Santa Anita 
and will appreciate the lesser company after meeting the likes of Lykatill Hil, 
The Wicked North and Devil His Due in his recent starts. Kent Desormeaux, who 
has the most success with the colt, will ride. Kingdom Found drew the outside 
post in the field of eight. 
</P>
<P>
 From the rail out, the others scheduled to go in the Classic, at 1 1/8 miles, 
are Warning Label, Flying Sensation, who won the Cal Cup Juvenile last year; 
Hill Pass, Bossanova, Goldigger's Dream, who was third behind Best Pal and 
Native Boundary in the 1993 Classic as a maiden; College Town and Corslew. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a look at the other eight California Cup races: 
</P>
<P>
 Mile -- The beaten favorite in this race last year, Journalism will appreciate 
the absence of Megan's Interco and Moscow Changes, the two horses who finished 
in front of him in 1993. Blaze O'Brien returned from a year layoff to win at 
Del Mar and came back with a bullet drill. All Boldandcayerless does is win -- 
having three victories and two seconds in five starts this year -- and he'll be 
tough if he can handle Santa Anita's sandy turf course. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprint -- The decision to run Argolid here instead of the longer Classic is 
the right one. Winless in seven in a row before returning to Santa Anita, 
Argolid won impressively Oct. 13 and is definitely best sprinting. Uncaged Fury 
is on the rail and, even though the post has produced a lot of winners during 
the Oak Tree meeting, the gelding has had trouble leaving the gate. A misstep 
today could prove costly. Fu Man Slew has won two of three here and didn't care 
for the muddy going at Turfway Park last month. Softshoe Sure Shot is the 
defending champion and the 8-year-old can never be counted out. 
</P>
<P>
 Matron -- Owners Martin and Pam Wygod hold a strong hand with the entry of 
Glass Ceiling and Private Persuasion. Both will appreciate getting back on the 
main track. Janet Garrison stretched out for the first time at Del Mar and won 
with ease. She is the one to fear most. 
</P>
<P>
 Distaff -- Starolamo has won four of five this year for trainer Kim Lloyd and 
the only time she tried the turf, she won by five lengths last July 10 at 
Hollywood Park. The lone concern is how she'll handle Santa Anita's unique 
hillside layout. Miss L Attack upset Bel's Starlet in this event last year and 
she showed she's back on her game with an Oct. 8 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Juvenile -- Again, the Wygods have a strong entry with Testimony and Strategic 
Alliance. Testimony broke his maiden sprinting in his third try and acts as if 
he'll have trouble with the extra distance. Strategic Alliance adds blinkers 
and is better than his last would indicate. Longliner is a maiden, but he 
improved dramatically around two turns, and Mahryebo hails from a sharp 
Northern California barn (Jelina Pike). 
</P>
<P>
 Juvenile Fillies -- Cat's Cradle romped home by nine earlier in the meeting 
and will be a short price today. Roujoleur is another from the Pike stable and 
she looked good beating weak allowance rivals on the Bay Meadows turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Starter Handicap -- Cantua Creek has been one of the unluckiest horses in 
California recently because he has run well enough to win four times in a row 
and has had to settle for second each time. The question with him is whether he 
can run this far. Big Pal will have no problem with the trip and he is much 
better on dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Distaff Starter Handicap -- A two-filly race between She's Enchanting and 
Brendas Wildindian. The latter has rattled off three in a row, but the former 
might be more effective going 1 1/8 miles, today's distance. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The racing career of Desert Mirage, the runner-up in the recent Norfolk 
Stakes, is almost certainly over. The 2-year-old son of Skywalker fractured the 
sesamoid bone in his right front leg and surgery Thursday revealed there was 
also extensive ligament damage. A maiden trained by Jim Buss, Desert Mirage was 
going to run in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. . . . Post time today is noon, half 
an hour earlier than usual. . . . Garr Kluender, 44, who designed the horse 
racing handicapping system called SURELOCK, died Thursday of a heart attack. 
Kluender, a member of the Times sports copy desk, had previously worked at 
newspapers in Des Moines, Iowa, St. Louis, Phoenix and Minneapolis. He is 
survived by his wife, Maureen; twin sisters Martha and Mary Kluender of Des 
Moines and brother Stanton of Des Moines. Funeral services will be held next 
week in Des Moines.

<P>
 Running back Jerry Brown led a balanced offense for Taft High, which 
overwhelmed Cleveland, 32-14, Friday night in a Northwest Valley Conference 
game at Taft. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a senior, rushed 28 times for 186 yards and scored touchdowns on runs 
of 25 and 10 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft (7-1, 5-0 ) rushed for 235 yards and passed for 211. The Toreadors built 
a 25-0 lead at halftime but Cleveland (4-4, 3-2) scored two touchdowns to pull 
to within 25-14 early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland running back Russell Burwell (19 carries, 63 yards) scored on a 
three-yard run to complete an 80-yard drive and Ramon Venegas scored on 48-yard 
swing pass from Johnny Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 With four minutes to play, Taft embarked on a three-minute scoring drive led 
by Brown's 46 yards in nine carries. Deyon Shaw completed 11 of 18 for 188 
yards and a touchdown and tight end DaShon Polk caught four passes for 75 yards 
and a touchdown. Polk also threw a 23-yard pass for a score. GREG ANAPOL

HART AVOIDS FRIGHT NIGHT, 20-7

<TEXT>
<P>
 It figured on the Friday night before Halloween top-ranked Hart High would get 
its biggest scare of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart's 20-7 Foothill League victory over Burbank at Burroughs High was one 
that could have turned into an upset. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart (8-0, 3-0 in league play) didn't lead by more than seven points against 
the Bulldogs (3-5, 0-2) until late in the game, when junior Ted Iacenda scored 
his third touchdown on a 12-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank, which trailed, 13-7, at halftime, had its chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Four times the Bulldogs turned the ball over inside the Hart 20-yard line. 
Quarterback Jason Jonas threw his third interception of the game on third and 
goal from the Indian six with just over six minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart depended on Iacenda's footwork because its powerful passing attack never 
got into sync. 
</P>
<P>
 Iacenda, who didn't practice all week while nursing an ankle injury, rushed 
for 141 yards and two touchdowns in 19 carries. He also caught a touchdown 
pass. BRIAN CHALEW

 Dave Lins, the area's leading Southern Section passer, threw two touchdown 
passes and completed 18 of 24 for 174 yards to lead the Celts to a 17-7 victory 
over Alemany in a Del Rey League game Friday night at Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
 Crespi (5-3, 3-0 in league play) leads the league and is almost assured of a 
Division I playoff berth.Alemany (1-5-2, 0-3) was held to 13 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 28-yard field goal by Greg Boskin opened the scoring, Lins hit Marcos 
Solorzano from six yards with 12 seconds remaining in the first quarter to give 
Crespi a 10-0 lead. The ball was tipped, first by a Celt receiver, then by an 
Alemany defensive back before falling into the arms of Solorzano in the end 
zone. On the ensuing kickoff, Crespi's Wayne Emerson recovered a fumble at the 
Alemany 24. Three plays later Lins hit Emerson from 11 yards, making the score 
17-0 early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 After being shut out in its previous two games, Alemany finally scored on 
quarterback Rudy Pantoja's one-yard run just before halftime. The touchdown was 
set up by Ben Lovato's blocked punt. LANCE O'FALLON

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; ALISO NIGUEL STAVES OFF LAGUNA BEACH 
RALLY, 45-39

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 29-point fourth quarter rally by Laguna Beach fell just short Friday night 
as Aliso Niguel held on for a 45-39 Pacific Coast League victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading, 45-10, with 7 minutes 49 seconds remaining in the game, the Artists 
nearly painted a masterful miracle finish, scoring four consecutive touchdowns, 
thanks to two onside kick recoveries. 
</P>
<P>
 Nate Pivaroff sparked the Laguna Beach flurry, throwing three touchdown 
passes. His favorite receiver, Aaron Chesley, caught two touchdown passes, of 
49 and 23 yards. Shane Loidolt completed the rally with a 25-yard run and a 
31-scoring pass from Pivaroff. 
</P>
<P>
 Pivaroff completed 16 of 30 passes for 287 yards in the game. The Wolverines 
built their early lead behind sophomore Scott Nemeth. Taking the opening 
kickoff on its own 25-yard line, Nemeth drove his Aliso Niguel team 70 yards in 
six plays. A 28-yard run by Nick Gerasimou set up the first score, a 10-yard 
run by Trent Purley. 
</P>
<P>
 Nemeth increased the the Wolverine lead to 22-3 late in the first half with 
two touchdown passes, a 14-yarder to Justin Martin and a six-yarder to Nick 
Gerasimou. Nemeth was near perfect form the pocket, completing 12 of 16 passes 
for 215 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 His best throw of the night may very well have been a third-quarter screen to 
DeAngelo Gossett. 
</P>
<P>
 Back-pedaling, Nemeth faked right and dumped a screen over a charging Laguna 
Beach player. Gossett did the rest, sprinting 60 yards for the touchdown and a 
39-10 lead. RICK CHRISTOPHER

 La Habra's defense was forced to stop Fullerton twice in the final 2 1/2 
minutes of the game to preserve a 27-26 victory Friday night at La Habra in 
Freeway League play. 
</P>
<P>
 After a referee's inadvertent whistle negated a Highlanders' fumble recovery, 
Fullerton running back Chris Young found Ryan Gregory with a 45-yard touchdown 
pass to pull within one point with 2 minutes 14 seconds left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians attempted a two-point conversion because Aaron Kosareff had 
already blocked two conversion attempts in the game. Gabriel Almanza was forced 
from the pocket and scrambled to the five-yard line, where he was knocked out 
of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton had a last chance when the Highlanders (3-5, 1-2) were forced to 
punt. With 1:19 left, Rickey Martinez intercepted a pass by Almanza and 
clinched the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra dominated the first half, jumping to a 17-0 lead after a field goal 
by Chris Diaz, a five-yard touchdown run by Johnny Yoo and a seven-yard scoring 
pass from Sonje Berg to Will McIntosh. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (4-4, 1-2) scored on a one-yard dive by John Wilkie with 29 seconds 
left in the half, but a 66-yard kickoff return by Raoul Apodaca set up a 
24-yard field goal by Diaz with one second left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders scored again on a one-yard run by Nick Armstrong. JASON HILL

 Charles Chatman rushed for 251 yards and four touchdowns in 27 carries, 
leading Costa Mesa to a 55-12 Pacific Coast League victory over Estancia Friday 
night at Newport Harbor High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatman ran for a 65-yard touchdown on the game's first play, and a 39-yard 
touchdown on Costa Mesa's next possession.That run gave him 139 yards with 6 
minutes 58 seconds left in the first quarter, and again it appeared he would 
threaten the county single-game rushing record of 418, set by Dana Hills' Jim 
Gleed in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Chatman ran for 414 yards against Aliso Niguel, but Estancia (3-5, 
0-3) held him to 48 yards the rest of the half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured I wasn't going to get too many more yards," Chatman said. "I 
figured they were going to key on me, and that opened up the passing game, 
which was good for the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Chatman added a one-yard run in the second quarter, then Costa Mesa 
quarterback Ryan Taylor hit Brian Reeves for scoring passes of 32 and 30 yards 
in the second and third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatman scored on a 13-yard run with nine minutes left, giving Costa Mesa 
(7-1, 3-0) a 42-6 lead. Joey Archuletta scored on a one-yard run with 6:18 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia scored on one-yard runs by Frough Jahid in the second quarter and 
Oscar Lomeli with 43 seconds left. GABE LACQUES

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; HAWKS, MCGRAW RUN BY UNIVERSITY 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Laguna Hills and the Brendan McGraw express ran over another Pacific Coast 
League football opponent Friday, posting a 35-7 victory over University at 
Mission Viejo High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks scored on their first four possessions with McGraw, who gained 192 
yards in 30 carries and scored three touchdowns, leading the way. McGraw, the 
county's second-leading rusher with 1,682 yards, highlighted a first-string 
offense that rolled up 356 yards in three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks' defense was equally efficient, limiting University to 63 yards in 
the first half while Laguna Hills built a 28-point halftime lead. Laguna Hills 
(6-2, 3-0 in league) has allowed only 16 points in three league games. 
</P>
<P>
 "They handed it to us," University Coach Mark Cunningham said. "They didn't do 
anything we weren't expecting; we have no excuses."  
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills didn't do anything to disguise its game plan, with quarterback 
Cory Pardoe handing the ball off to McGraw on the game's first four plays. 
McGraw accounted for all 54 of the yards on the opening drive, capping it with 
a 33-yard touchdown run just 1 minute 50 seconds into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw also scored on runs of two and seven yards, giving him 27 touchdowns 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Pardoe kept University's defense honest, completing four of six passes for 86 
yards. Pardoe's 22-yard touchdown pass to Marcus Elliott gave the Hawks a 21-0 
lead with 1:43 remaining in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 On Laguna Hills' first possession of the third quarter, McGraw carried the 
ball on 11 consecutive plays to set up the Hawks' final touchdown, an 
eight-yard touchdown pass to Jay Johnson from Pardoe, to finish a 64-yard drive 
that took more than seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills Coach Steve Bresnahan liked his offense's production, but also 
praised his first-string defense, which allowed only 101 yards and five first 
downs in a little more than three quarters. Defensive backs Ted Wenzel and 
Elliott each had one interception. 
</P>
<P>
 University broke up the shutout with 4:43 remaining in the fourth quarter when 
Alan Price scored on a seven-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 "The score doesn't bother me as much as we lacked intensity tonight," 
Cunningham said. "That's never happened before. Great backs like McGraw are 
going to get their yards, but we didn't even get any good licks on him 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 It won't get any easier for University (4-4, 2-1) because it plays Costa Mesa 
(7-1, 3-0), and the county's leading rusher -- Charles Chatman -- next week.

NOTRE DAME RUNS DOWN A WIN 
</P>

 In a game that featured likely and unlikely ballcarriers, Notre Dame High 
outran St. Francis to a 34-13 Mission League victory Friday night at St. 
Francis. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame's ground attack edged that of St. Francis, 215 yards to 207. 
Meanwhile, Notre Dame's defense, which has allowed 69 points this season, 
limited St. Francis quarterbacks Brian Rucker and John Carnevali to a combined 
nine of 30 passing. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback John Garcia led Notre Dame (7-1, 3-0 in league play) with 121 yards 
and two touchdowns in 19 carries. Junior quarterback Ryan Bowne was a surprise 
contributor, gaining 60 yards in four bootlegs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of felt we would be able to run the ball on them," Notre Dame Coach 
Kevin Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Francis (4-3-1, 1-2), which trailed, 28-7, at halftime, was led by 
tailback Darin Maxwell, who rushed for a game-high 136 yards and one touchdown 
in 21 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell, who impressively lowered his shoulder and bowled over defenders, 
accounted for 48 yards of a 77-yard fourth-quarter drive that culminated with 
his one-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Francis' surprise contributor was left guard John Jones, who dashed 52 
yards for a second-quarter touchdown on a so-called "fumblerooskie" play. 
</P>
<P>
 But resorting to deception only underscored Notre Dame's dominance of the line 
of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew Notre Dame was good, but they were even better than I thought they 
would be," St. Francis Coach Bill Redell said. "When you have to rely on a 
fumblerooskie to score, you're not moving the ball too well." 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame marched 67 yards in its opening possession to take a 7-0 lead on 
fullback Don Ebenhoch's one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights scored on three consecutive possessions in the second quarter. 
Bowne hit split end Troy Garner with a 48-yard touchdown pass, Bowne dashed 16 
yards on a keeper and Garcia ran 24 yards for another score. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia added another touchdown late in the half on a three-yard run.

GLENDALE TO BE UP FRONT; WILSON TOLD TO SIT BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Undefeated Jeff Wilson of Moorpark College and top-ranked Glendale will take 
decidedly different approaches in the men's race at today's Johnie O 
cross-country invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, a former standout at Newbury Park High, has won all five of his races 
this season by comfortable margins, but Raider Coach Manny Trevino says today's 
meet is more of a learning experience for his charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him not to worry about winning the race," Trevino said. "I told him 
that if he has the feeling that the first mile is going to run (in the 4 minute 
25 seconds to 4:30 range), that he should let the leaders go and not worry 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 If the first mile is a more-serene 4:35 to 4:40, however, Wilson should be in 
the lead pack along with Riverside's Wilhelm Gidabuday, Aberrazak Merchoud, 
Cosmos Nguhn and Cruz Gallegos, San Diego Mesa's Nazario Romero, El Camino's 
Morris Giddens and Glendale's Jacques Sallberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Gidabuday, the runner-up in last year's State cross-country championships, 
Merchoud (sixth), Nguhn and Gallegos finished 1-2-3-4 in the Irvine 
Invitational three weeks ago, but at least one local coach figures Wilson has a 
chance to break up that foursome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if any of us have seen Gidabuday really race this season," 
Antelope Valley's Mark Covert said. "But I wouldn't be surprised to see Wilson 
in the top two or three, considering that he's running on his home course." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale has been the top-ranked team in the state since edging Riverside, 
45-52, in the Irvine meet and Vaquero Coach Eddie Lopez wants his team's 
momentum to continue to build as it approaches next month's State 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Sallberg, Glendale will try to place five runners among the top 25. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Vaqueros accomplish that, they'll have a good chance to win because 
Riverside's fifth -- and final -- scoring runner has often been two minutes 
behind the Tigers' fourth man this season. 
</P>
<P>
 A comparable time gap today could leave Riverside's fifth runner in 70th or 
80th place. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's race should be a battle among San Diego Mesa, El Camino, defending 
State champion Irvine Valley and Orange Coast, last year's runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura, led by freshman Josephina Sanchez, could contend for a top-five 
finish. The Pirates placed second in the Santa Barbara Invitational two weeks 
ago, seven points behind Orange Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Sanchez, Heidi Tisovic of College of the Canyons and Tanya 
Janet of Glendale are expected to be among the top performers from the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's meet, named after late Yuba City Coach John O'Rognen, serves as the de 
facto Southern California championships. 
</P>
<P>
 The top eight teams in each race will automatically qualify for the State 
championships. The ninth- through 14th-place finishers have an excellent chance 
at advancing, depending on what happens when the six Southern California 
conferences hold their finals. 
</P>
<P>
 The meet starts with the women's race at 10 a.m., followed by the men's at 
10:45.

 In a tight defensive game, Buena Park held on in the closing minutes to record 
a 10-7 Freeway League victory over Sunny Hills Friday night at Buena Park High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coyotes (2-6, 1-2) used a 79-yard touchdown pass and an interception by 
Jonathan Fagins that set up the go-ahead field goal to steal the game from the 
Lancers.Quarterback David Barrios led the struggling Coyotes with 52 yards 
rushing and 106 yards passing. 
</P>
<P>
 With 4 minutes 53 seconds left in the first half, the Lancers (2-6, 1-2) got a 
break when a roughing-the-kicker penalty gave them the ball at the Coyote 
nine-yard line. Two Greg Garand runs later, the Lancers led, 7-0. Garand had 41 
yards rushing and 113 yards passing for Sunny Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, the Coyotes got the big plays they needed to take the 
lead. On its first possession of the half, the Coyotes drove 63 yards on eight 
plays, one of them a dropped pass in the end zone. The Coyotes settled for a 
Jude Reyes' 20-yard field goal to cut the lead to 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
 With 2:34 left in the third quarter, Buena Park began a drive at its own 
20-yard line after a Lancer missed field goal. After a one-yard Barrios run, he 
rolled left and found Corey Lyday behind his defender on the side line. Barrios 
had just enough on the pass to beat the defender, and Lyday outran the safety 
for a 79-yard play and the go-ahead touchdown. TED APODACA

 Jason Gaudy scored four touchdowns, including the game-winner late in the 
game, to give Ontario Christian a 30-27 victory over Brethren Christian in an 
Olympic League game Friday at Ontario Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory kept the Knights (7-1, 2-1 in league) within a half-game of 
league-leaders Orange Lutheran and Cerritos Valley Christian.It also broke 
Ontario Christian's five-game losing streak against Brethren Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaudy caught a 15-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Harlan Miersma with 4 
minutes 16 seconds left in the game.  
</P>
<P>
 Gaudy, from his defensive back position, also contributed key plays. He scored 
on a 20-yard interception return with 7:46 left in the first half.  
</P>
<P>
 He then added two sacks of Brethren Christian quarterback Ryan Babcock as the 
Warriors tried to drive late in the game.  
</P>
<P>
 Brethren Christian (1-7, 0-3) took a 7-0 lead midway through the first quarter 
when sophomore quarterback Dan Muilenburg scored on a four-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Ontario Christian scored 16 points in the second quarter to take a 23-14 
halftime lead, but Brethren Christian took advantage of three fumble recoveries 
to score 10 points in the third quarter and take a 24-23 lead. DALE RUHE

 San Clemente celebrated its homecoming by defeating winless Dana Hills, 26-7, 
in front of 2,000 at San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente's defense intercepted three Scott Maynard passes, and returned 
two for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 After a scoreless first quarter, San Clemente began to take control with Sean 
Kolmer's 20-yard interception return that gave Tritons a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills' second drive went nowhere, and Trevor Insley returned the 
Dolphins' punt 34 yards to put the Tritons at the Dolphins' 25-yard line. On 
that drive, Cheyenne Dixon ran in from the three-yard line to increase the 
Tritons' lead to 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The second half began similarly for the Dolphins. Maynard was pressured by the 
Tritons' pass rush and San Clemente linebacker Robert Frith stepped in front of 
the intended Dolphin receiver and ran 41 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente (4-4, 1-2) ended the third quarter with a 20-0 lead after a 
failed conversion attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills (0-8, 0-2) tried to get its passing game working, but the Tritons' 
secondary, led by defensive backs Reagan West and Sam Kweskin kept the ball 
away from the receivers with a number of spectacular plays. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente's offense struggled to find the end zone. RICHARD MELKONIAN

 Marina's Steve Cooper intercepted a pass and returned it 17 yards for a 
touchdown in the first quarter to help the Vikings to a 7-6 victory over 
Huntington Beach in a Sunset League game Friday at Westminster High. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory ended a two-game losing streak for Marina (6-2, 1-2 in league).It 
was the fourth consecutive loss for Huntington Beach (1-7, 0-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, a linebacker, rushed in on the play, grabbed Huntington Beach 
quarterback Jason Bartusick's screen pass and ran to the end zone untouched. 
The play came with 1 minute 1 second left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7-0 lead held up until Huntington Beach finally scored on Jason Locklin's 
three-yard sweep around the right side with 9:08 left in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers lined up for an extra point try, but the play unraveled when 
Huntington Beach realized it didn't have the kicking tee. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Huntington Beach players ran to the sideline to get the tee, then 
decided to try the kick without it. But the play was rushed, the snap was 
bobbled and Marina defenders stopped the conversion attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach had another chance to win the game but Bartusick's field goal 
attempt from 42 yards was wide right with 2:49 left. He had missed from 29 
yards midway through the third quarter. KEN HILL

 Foothill put itself in good position to repeat as Century League champion, but 
it had to shake off a dreadful first half to defeat Santa Ana Valley, 27-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Two touchdown runs by Tramel Robinson and one each by Nick Sveslosky and 
Lawrence Mariner rallied Foothill from a seven-point halftime deficit to a 
victory that spoiled the Falcons' homecoming Friday night at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a wake-up call," Foothill Coach Tom Meiss said. "I feel like we dodged 
a bullet. The final score won't indicate how close it was. I was very impressed 
with Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley's defense ruled Foothill for a half. It limited the Knights 
to a meager 38 yards rushing, 52 yards in offense and three first downs. 
</P>
<P>
 A six-yard scoring run by Dwayne Cherrington, who finished with 105 yards 
rushing in 26 carries, at 8:40 of the second quarter gave the Falcons a 7-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But Foothill (4-4, 3-0), which can clinch a share of the league title with a 
victory over Orange Friday, came alive in the second half. The Knights, who won 
their third in a row, scored on four of their five possessions to pull away as 
Santa Ana Valley's offense went nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 On Foothill's second play, Nick Sveslosky broke free for a 52-yard touchdown 
run with only 1:20 gone in the third quarter to tie the score. Fullback 
Lawrence Mariner, a recent transfer from El Modena, gave Foothill a 13-7 lead 
on a three-yard scoring run with 29 seconds remaining in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson scored twice in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill's defense, led by defensive end Rich Bowman, held the Falcons to 42 
yards in the second half. Foothill finished with 236 yards overall, 181 on the 
ground. Santa Ana Valley (3-5, 1-2) had 184 overall.

 Senior quarterback Adam Hoover passed for 253 yards and three touchdowns and 
Orange County's leading receiver, Greg Jacobs, had 146 yards and a touchdown as 
Canyon shut out El Modena, 31-0, in a Century League game Friday at El Modena. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs, who hauled in six receptions to add to his lead, was carried off the 
field on a stretcher and taken to Chapman General Hospital after converging on 
a tackle while playing at defensive back with 1 minute 39 seconds remaining in 
the third quarter.X-rays were taken but the extent of his injury was not 
disclosed by medical personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comanches scored on their first possession, when Hoover hit Jacobs cutting 
across the field for a 53-yard touchdown on their third play of the game. 
Jacobs caught the ball on a dead run and raced down the right sideline for the 
score. Hoover, who used his speed and mobility to maneuver in the pocket and 
avoid the pass rush, completed 10 of 15 passes without an interception. 
</P>
<P>
 After forcing the Vanguards to punt, Canyon (6-2, 2-1) promptly scored on its 
next possession, when tailback K.C. Pelle turned a Hoover shovel-pass into a 
78-yard touchdown. The score gave Canyon a 14-0 lead after one quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena was plagued by poor field position, and was held to only 104 yards 
total offense and forced to punt four times in the first half, as Canyon built 
a 28-0 lead. The Vanguards' starting quarterback, Jeremy Seltzer, completed 
three of 11 passes for 33 yards. He also was sacked three times. The Vanguards 
got inside the Comanche 25-yard line only once. COREY LYONS

 Cal Lutheran squares off with Claremont Mudd today at 2 p.m. in the Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference championship soccer match. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran, (6-13, 6-4 in the SCIAC) won the West division, while Claremont 
(14-2-1, 9-1) breezed to the East title. 
</P>
<P>
 Claremont is ranked eighth nationally in the Division III poll and has won or 
shared the SCIAC title 13 consecutive years. The Stags also have a chance to 
host the Western Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 If Cal Lutheran can score an upset, Claremont will be eliminated from playoff 
contention and the regional will be held elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Claremont defeated Cal Lutheran, 3-0, in the teams' only other meeting this 
season, and Pat Gorgue, the Stags' leading scorer, returns to the lineup after 
sitting out a match because he drew a red card. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Collins and Jan Hammervold are the top scoring threats for Cal Lutheran. 
Collins, a freshman forward, has 11 goals and 11 assists. Hammervold leads Cal 
Lutheran with 15 goals.  
</P>
<P>
 The SCIAC champion does not receive an automatic bid to the NCAA playoffs. If 
Cal Lutheran wins, the conference will not have a representative this season.

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; KENNEDY'S FIELD GOALS ARE ENOUGH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After the game, Loara's Mike Wright yelled, then slammed his helmet to the 
ground and yelled again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saxons (3-5, 2-1) had a lot to shout about, considering they did 
everything but beat sixth-ranked Kennedy Friday night at Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy (7-1, 3-0) eventually won the Empire League game, 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody gave us a prayer," Loara Coach John deFries said. "Nobody gives us 
credit." 
</P>
<P>
 DeFries kept repeating one word after the game, even when he shook the hand of 
Kennedy Coach Mitch Olson: "Undermanned." 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of missed field goals and an untimely penalty hurt, too. 
</P>
<P>
 With Loara on Kennedy's 30-yard line and facing a fourth and two in the 
closing seconds, the Saxons' Korei Kilburn ran six yards for an apparent first 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saxons, however, were penalized for aiding the runner. Loara came up short 
on its next play and Kennedy ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 "The officials didn't lose the game," deFries said. "We kick the two field 
goals, we win." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Murmaud, Loara's kicker, after connecting on a 43-yard field goal in the 
first quarter, missed attempts from 26 and 36 yards in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Marino kicked two field goals for Kennedy, connecting from 31 yards 
out in the first quarter to give Kennedy a 3-0 lead. He kicked the game-winner 
from 23 yards with 4:47 left to play. RUSSELL BANKS

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; BOLSA GRANDE MANAGES TO MAKE THE FEWEST 
MISTAKES IN VICTORY

 Eric Shaner scored on a pair of short runs as host Bolsa Grande defeated La 
Quinta, 14-10, Friday night in a mistake-filled Garden Grove League game. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaner, who played the second half with a broken left arm, capped a 10-play, 
66-yard march when he bulled in from one yard on fourth down for the winning 
score. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors (2-6, 1-3) were aided on the drive when the Aztec line jumped 
offside on a fourth-down punt, giving Bolsa Grande a first down. Two plays 
later on second and three, David Price found Paul Sharpe for a 36-yard 
completion. Shaner would plunge in four plays later. 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta (1-7, 0-5) shot itself in the foot regularly. The game was 
epitomized near the end when the Aztecs, trying to punt the ball away, 
committed two illegal-procedure penalties. When they finally did get away a 
kick that counted, the Aztecs were flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, La Quinta managed to lead at the half, thanks to Jhamal Dawkins. The 
sophomore halfback rushed for 91 yards -- or all but two of his team's total 
output -- in the first half, including a 62-yard touchdown sprint in the second 
quarter that gave the Aztecs their only lead, 10-6. AHMED V. ORTIZ

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; ARROWHEAD LEAGUE; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
CHRISTIAN SHUT OUT AGAIN

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arrowhead Christian returned two interceptions for touchdowns in the first 
half on its way to a 27-0 victory over Southern California Christian Friday 
night at Arrowhead Christian Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 SCC has now been shut out four times this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Donovan and Taylor Mast each returned passes thrown by SCC's Steve 
Schinhofen for 22-yard touchdowns, giving Arrowhead a 13-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Laramie Lumley led SCC (1-7, 0-3 ) with 80 yards rushing in 16 carries. The 
closest the Flames came to scoring was in the second quarter. The Flames drove 
to the Arrowhead 10-yard line, but a holding penalty and two incomplete passes 
ended the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrowhead (4-4, 2-1) added two touchdowns in the second half. Matt McMurray 
caught a 40-yard touchdown pass from Clint Toth, and John Hurst scored on a 
five-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Schinhofen completed one of nine passes for 13 yards and threw two 
interceptions. He also lost two fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Cunningham had 12 tackles and blocked extra point for SCC, his third 
blocked kick of the year.

 David Myers ran for three first-quarter touchdowns and intercepted three 
passes as host El Dorado retained its playoff hopes with a 26-13 victory over 
Katella Friday at Valencia High. 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado (4-4, 2-1) scored on its first three possessions of the game to 
lead, 19-0, at the end of the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers, who ran for 79 yards in 16 carries, scored from eight yards on his 
first carry, completing the Golden Hawks' 11-play, 86-yard opening drive. 
</P>
<P>
 On El Dorado's next possession, Myers swept right and broke a tackle for a 
37-yard touchdown. Mike Marzicola's conversion pass attempt was batted down at 
the line of scrimmage, but the Golden Hawks led, 12-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Katella (0-8, 0-3) started on its 17-yard line after the kickoff, but Sal 
Viramontes' pass on the first play was intercepted by Myers, who returned it 28 
yards to Katella's 11-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, Myers ran four yards for his third touchdown of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers actually had a hand in all first-half scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the second quarter, Viramontes threw deep for Josh Welton, but 
the pass was under-thrown. Myers, trying for what would have given him four 
interceptions, tipped the ball into the end zone, where Welton easily caught it 
for a 41-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Katella's Willie Demyers ran for 50 yards in five carries to lead Katella, 
which remained winless in eight games. GEOFF BILAU

COLLEGE VOLLEYBALL ROUNDUP; LONG BEACH DEFEATS SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Allowing opponents to creep back from large deficits does wonders for crowd 
participation -- but it's not a formula for long-term success. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the Long Beach State women's volleyball team saw the opportunity to 
end its match-long negative trend, it finally seized the moment Friday night 
with a 14-16, 15-11, 15-8, 15-4, Big West Conference victory over visiting 
Santa Barbara before 1,497 at The Gold Mine. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending national champion Long Beach (16-3, 11-1 in conference play) 
continually took early leads, but let the Gauchos right back. The 49ers, ranked 
ninth in the nation, were finally able to right themselves in the fourth game, 
sustaining a nice cushion and finishing off No. 10 Santa Barbara (19-4, 8-2) on 
the last of senior outside hitter Nichelle Burton's game-high 19 kills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have won it in three (games)," said 49er Coach Brian Gimmillaro, 
whose team trails league-leading Hawaii by a half game. "We just stopped 
playing at times." 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers jumped out to a 3-0 first-game lead and led by as many as nine 
points at 13-4. But then the third-place Gauchos started concentrating -- and 
Long Beach seemed to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara overwhelmed Long Beach, scoring 10 of the next 11 points to tie 
the game at 14. The Gauchos completed their impressive rally on a service ace 
by junior middle blocker Tammy Stiner, which capped their 16-14 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Game 2 looked like a replay of the opener after the 49ers let an 11-3 lead 
dwindle to a three-point lead, 14-11. But Long Beach managed to hang on this 
time, winning 15-11. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach's 15-8 victory in the third game gave it a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, the 49ers started fast, jumping out to a 4-0 advantage. An ace by 
senior defensive specialist Prentice Perkins, her fourth of five in the match, 
put the 49ers ahead, 14-8. Junior outside hitter Brita Schwerm ended the game 
with a kill, one of her 15. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Golden State Athletic Conference: 
</P>
<P>
 Biola 3, Concordia 0 -- Sarah Rameson had 14 kills to lead Biola (14-10, 7-5) 
to a 15-4, 15-9, 15-9, win. Jen Guzman and Molly Jordan each had nine kills for 
host Concordia (12-14, 2-10).

COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROUNDUP; GOLDEN WEST RALLY FALLS SHORT IN 13-12 LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long Beach, the second-ranked team in the state, beat top-ranked Golden West, 
13-12, to win the South Coast League water polo championship Friday at Belmont 
Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West (23-2, 4-1) rallied for six goals in the final quarter, but it 
wasn't enough.Both of Golden West's losses this season have been against Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Orange Empire Conference: 
</P>
<P>
 Grossmont 11, Orange Coast 8 -- Jam Guiliamotti scored four goals to lead 
Grossmont (26-6, 6-0), which clinched the conference championship. Grossmont is 
the third-ranked team in the state and OCC is ranked fourth. Shad Wicker scored 
four goals and Kaj Sturdivant recorded 10 saves for Orange Coast (15-6-1, 5-1). 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange Empire Conference women's soccer: 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress 2, Orange Coast 1 -- Visiting Orange Coast became the first team to 
score against Cypress this season when Danae Fielder scored from about 20 yards 
out in the 58th minute.  
</P>
<P>
 But Cypress (12-0, 10-0) rallied to tie on a breakaway goal by Christine Tyler 
in the 77th minute. The Chargers took the lead a few minutes later when Pam 
Prine scored off a corner kick by Tracy Van Herk. It was the 15th assist for 
Van Herk this season. It was the 35th consecutive conference victory for 
Cypress, the top-ranked team in the state.

GARZA WANTS TO HELP LEAD FULLERTON TO BETTER TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Garza, a sophomore linebacker at Fullerton College, is a sucker for 
tradition. It can even bring tears to his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tradition was what made playing at Servite, where he was an All-Sunset League 
selection as a senior in 1992, so special. He can recall his first varsity game 
as if it just happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a pretty special game," he said. "The first time I played under the 
lights was at Gahr High School." 
</P>
<P>
 After high school, he had the chance to play at UC Davis and Sonoma State but 
neither appealed to him that much. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he went looking for local history and a chance to earn a scholarship 
to a more traditionally strong Division I college after two years at a 
community college. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't have to look further than Fullerton, which was one of the best 
programs in the nation under Coach Hal Sherbeck. Sherbeck's teams won three 
national championships and 16 conference titles. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was that by the time Garza was out of high school, Sherbeck had 
retired to Montana, and the program was struggling; Fullerton was 1-9 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garza was persuaded to attend Fullerton anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 He made up his mind when he spoke with offensive coordinator Glenn Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sold me on Fullerton," said Garza, 19. "He said that they had some tough 
times, but they were going to build it back up and I believed him. You could 
tell he really meant it." 
</P>
<P>
 Garza was an instant hit with the Hornet defense last season. He played a 
great deal in every game, starting the last six, and he led the team in 
tackles. But Fullerton finished 3-7, losing the last five. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have guys from Servite, Sunny Hills and Valencia and we're not used to a 
season like that," Garza said. "We just didn't get the breaks. (Four of the 
losses were by eight points or less). That's why we worked so hard in the 
off-season." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets again started slowly this season but have won three of the last 
four and Garza is leading them in tackles with 48, including 33 solo. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably the best time of my life," Garza said. "I know I can't do 
this all my life. As I get older, I'll have a job that isn't as much fun as 60 
minutes of football." 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Mission Conference Central Division games: 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West (2-4-1, 2-1) vs. Fullerton (3-2-1, 2-0), CS Fullerton, 1 p.m. -- A 
Fullerton victory would put the Hornets in a first-place tie with Rancho 
Santiago. Fullerton's John Ledieff and Jason Nevadomsky returned fumbles for 
touchdowns in a 21-13 victory over Riverside last week. Golden West, which beat 
Southwestern, 49-10, last week, has won the last two meetings with Fullerton. 
The Hornets lead the series, 16-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast (0-6, 0-2) at Southwestern (0-5-1, 0-1-1), 7 p.m. -- Both teams 
need a victory more for moral than any other reason. The six-game losing streak 
is the longest in the 22-year career of OCC Coach Bill Workman. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside (2-4, 1-2) at Saddleback (0-5-1, 0-1-1), 7 p.m. -- Andy Osborne, a 
sophomore linebacker for Saddleback, had 12 tackles in a 31-28 loss to El 
Camino last week. He has 184 and needs 23 in the final four games to become the 
college's all-time leader. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Mission Conference game: 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena (2-3-1) vs. Rancho Santiago (5-1), Santa Ana Stadium, 1:30 p.m. -- 
Rancho Santiago has won five in a row and is second in Southern California and 
12th in the J.C. Grid-Wire national rankings.

UNBEATEN LA VERNE WILL CHALLENGE CHAPMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With two exceptions, Chapman's first football team in 62 years has had its way 
with opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Meet probable exception No. 3: La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
 The Leopards (6-0) bring a No. 2 ranking in the NCAA Division III West Region 
into the game at 7 tonight at Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
 La Verne features the Southern California Athletic Conference's top rusher 
Darren MacLellan (789 yards, 157.8 per game) and most efficient passer Ryan 
Campuzano (153.7 rating). The Leopards have the conference's most stingy 
defense and most productive offense and have outscored their opponents, 236-90. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, it's unlikely Chapman will be overwhelmed. Although the Panthers tied 
Redlands, 14-14, and lost to Occidental, 30-20, they still have outscored their 
opponents, 219-89. 
</P>
<P>
 Still this game is clearly Chapman's toughest challenge remaining on the 
schedule. The Panthers (4-1-1) play host to Pomona-Pitzer (1-5) next week and 
finish the season at Cal Lutheran (2-4) Nov. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you don't have a conference championship to look forward to and you are 
just starting out," Chapman Coach Ken Visser said, "these are the type of big 
games you look forward to playing well in." 
</P>
<P>
 The game is also important to La Verne, although Coach Rex Huigens has said he 
might hold out a player or two to give them "extra rest" for the Leopards' 
final two conference games. 
</P>
<P>
 Visser doesn't buy such talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe that for one second," he said, "because he knows that going 
to the playoffs is on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not fooling anybody with that one." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, despite winning the conference title, a 7-2 La Verne team wasn't 
selected for the Division III playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 A victory over Chapman would surely enhance La Verne's chances this season, 
but Huigens said the Panthers present special problems because of their speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they have as good personnel as any team we have faced," Huigens said. 
"We've got just one or two kids who can run pretty well, but I don't have as 
many guys who can run as well as Chapman does." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, we can hold them a little under 62." Chapman Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers' first two home games were sellouts, but a limited number of 
tickets remain for tonight's game. . . . Curtis Robinson, who was held out of 
practice and the game last week because of a separated shoulder, got in a full 
week's practice and will start at quarterback, Chapman Coach Ken Visser said. 
Jacob Galasso, who started the Menlo game at quarterback, is the primary backup 
this week. Quarterback Todd Gragnano's injured finger is also getting better. 
He held for the conversion and field-goal attempts and entered the game as 
quarterback in the fourth quarter last week. . . . Chapman has three players 
who have runs from scrimmage of more than 80 yards. Darnell Rubin, a wide 
receiver/kick returner who is being tried at tailback, ran 85 yards for a 
touchdown against Menlo. Oscar Ford scored on an 83-yard run against Occidental 
and Robinson had an 81-yard run against Azusa Pacific.

PROP. 187 UPROAR DISPLACES SAN DIEGO SYMPHONY CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Because of outrage in Mexico over Proposition 187, the Tijuana Cultural Center 
has canceled a scheduled joint concert Friday in Tijuana between the San Diego 
Symphony Orchestra and the Baja Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than let the event die, however, the San Diego Symphony has rescheduled 
the joint concert, to feature a Mexican version of "Romeo and Juliet," to 
Copley Symphony Hall in downtown San Diego on the same night. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is crazy to have art and politics mix like this," said San Diego 
Symphony executive director Michael Tiknis. "We've been banned from Mexico. For 
what?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Luis Pardo Aceves, sub-director of the Tijuana Cultural Center, notified 
Tiknis last week that the Proposition 187 controversy had caused Mexican 
sponsors to withdraw support for the concert. Also, Aceves said that the center 
could not ensure the safety of the San Diego musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego Symphony was to be paid $30,000 for the joint concert, to 
feature Guillermo Briseno's version of "Romeo and Juliet." 
</P>
<P>
 The 19-member Baja Orchestra includes 12 Russian emigre musicians living in 
Tijuana. TONY PERRY
