A LEGACY OF VIOLENCE; MIKAL GILMORE'S FAMILY MEMOIR ASKS THE QUESTION: WHERE 
DOES EVIL COME FROM? WHERE DOES IT END?; SHOT IN THE HEART, BY MIKAL GILMORE

<P>
 In dreams Mikal Gilmore has killed himself more than once, pulled the trigger 
and felt the back of his head explode. He has dreamed, too, of executing a 
brother born to be a victim and of standing by helplessly as another brother's 
child dies alongside her murdering father. And then there are the nights when 
sleep has found him trapped by a faceless, suffocating evil or haunted by a 
ghost that refuses to allow him even an uneasy peace. To those of us who are 
neither the brother of a killer nor the spawn of unparalleled dysfunction, 
these dreams would qualify as nightmares. To Mikal Gilmore, however, the only 
nightmare is his life. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, by the standards of his family, he has gotten off easy. He is the 
only one of four brothers to escape regular beatings by his father, the only 
one who never saw the old man pound his mother's face lopsided or had his hopes 
ravaged by the madness that is his heritage. He is the last born, the favorite 
son. All he must do is survey the wreckage around him and wonder what evil 
courses through his own veins. 
</P>
<P>
 So Gilmore comes to us with "Shot in the Heart," a family pathology that is as 
painful to read as it is impossible to put down. This is the book he seemingly 
had to write or go out of his mind. "Maybe if I could discover some answers," 
he says early on, "I might be able to bargain my way out of any further loss." 
But surely he began his search knowing those bargains are hard to come by. 
</P>
<P>
 His brother Gary is the Gilmore America remembers -- the slayer of two men and 
the willing target of a Utah firing squad 17 years ago, captured in print by 
Norman Mailer, portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones in a TV movie, held up for 
inspection by the punk rock band that wondered how the world looked through his 
eyes. The other two Gilmore boys remain as anonymous as Gary was infamous. 
Gaylen was a poet, a drunk and a petty crook who died a painful death most 
likely because he bedded one too many of his best friends' wives. Frank Jr. 
inherited his father's name, but his spirit was crushed at every succeeding 
turn by the very people who brought him into this world and left him fit for 
nothing better than day labor and flophouse beds. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary, Gaylen and Frank Jr. turned out the only way they could after being 
raised by parents who somehow managed to inflict more physical and 
psychological abuse on their children than they did on each other. Even Mikal, 
whom they both cherished, could not escape the evil that came to them as 
naturally as breathing. His mother tried to smother him with a pillow when he 
was an infant, and his father damn near consigned him to a lifetime of hatred 
by pitting the kid against his brothers one harrowing Christmas. "What sad and 
wretched people Frank Gilmore and Bessie Brown were," Mikal writes. "I love 
them, but I have to say: It is heart-rending they ever had children at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmore's years of shame and denial have given way to a triumph both personal 
and literary. He has accomplished something even his most ardent admirers might 
not have suspected he was capable of when he wrote about rock 'n roll for 
Rolling Stone, L.A. Weekly and the dear departed Herald Examiner. It is one 
thing, after all, to explain the Sex Pistols' rage against society or to spread 
the word about Lucinda Williams' achingly beautiful song lyrics. It is quite 
another to deliver a book that can rightfully be placed alongside the best of 
this generation's harrowing family memoirs, Geoffrey Wolff's "The Duke of 
Deception," Tobias Wolff's "This Boy's Life" and William Kittredge's "Hole in 
the Sky." 
</P>
<P>
 Those works evoke a bleak and unforgiving country, but one that still seems 
almost benign compared to the hardscrabble West in "Shot in the Heart." It is 
frocked with trailer parks and seedy boardinghouses, tawdry violence and reform 
school horrors, boozy abandonments and half-brothers who come from out of 
nowhere -- all with a soundtrack by Elvis Presley and Fats Domino. So maybe 
readers shouldn't be surprised when Gilmore says Gary's paintings reminded him 
of Edward Hopper's. Whether they were in Portland, Seattle or Salt Lake City, 
the brothers grew up in an Edward Hopper world. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no other world in which their father could have functioned. Frank 
Gilmore had a psychic for a mother, and he liked to think that Houdini was his 
father. After working as a tightrope-walking circus clown named Laffo, he 
became a silent movie stuntman and a con artist who sold advertising for 
magazines that didn't exist. Oh yes, and he knew what the bottom of a bottle 
looked like. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly the profile you would expect for the future husband of a Mormon beauty 
from Provo, Utah, but then Bessie Brown always had a rebellious streak. She 
hated the farm she grew up on and the beatings she saw her father give her 
mother with his wooden leg. Bessie got beaten, too, never harder than when she 
discovered boys. But Frank Gilmore was no boy when she met him in Salt Lake. He 
was in his late 40s, almost twice her age and only four years younger than her 
father. He was a handsome rascal, though, and Bessie was enough of a free 
spirit not to mind that he was freshly divorced when he asked her to join him 
on a trip to Sacramento to visit his mother. They could even get married there 
-- if Bessie didn't object to such a casual proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 She should have, because after they were wed by Frank's mother, who just 
happened to be a minister, in a ceremony apparently conducted without benefit 
of a license, she started to realize her husband was a stranger. Mother Gilmore 
told her that Frank had been married six or seven times before, that he had 
even more aliases than ex-wives, and that he had sprinkled the countryside with 
God knows how many children. 
</P>
<P>
 What Bessie confronted in the years that followed was far worse. There was 
Frank's penchant for violence, and there was his vile tongue, which may have 
left more scars on Bessie and the boys than anything he did with razor straps, 
belts and his fists. Frank wasn't much for sticking around, either, whether he 
was abandoning Bessie and an infant son at a gas station in the middle of 
nowhere or running from the mysterious stranger who kept reappearing to remind 
him of bygone sins. Mikal was never able to determine what those sins were no 
matter how deeply he dug into his family's past, but one finishes "Shot in the 
Heart" wondering if Gary wasn't the only murderer in the family. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing could make Bessie leave, though. "Where would I have gone?" Mikal 
heard her asking Larry Schiller in the interviews that provided the backbone 
for Mailer's "The Executioner's Song." It is as if she began to sense her doom 
the day she saw her favorite sister die in a sledding accident. But Bessie had 
been haunted by the specter of violence and loss since she learned of Blood 
Atonement, the Mormon code of life-for-a-life retribution. And she passed her 
foreboding on to her sons by telling them about the hanging her father had 
forced her to watch when she was a child. Her story was a lie, as Mikal 
discovered in his research, but it still resonated through the lives she was 
helping to shape. So it is that Mikal writes, "I grew up in a family where the 
noose worked as a talisman; it hung over our heads not so much as a deterrent 
but as a sign of destiny." 
</P>
<P>
 The madness of Gilmore's parents permeates "Shot in the Heart" with the same 
ferocity that it warped him and his brothers. Once you understand that, you 
understand why Gary threw darts at his kid brother the only time Mikal can 
remember them playing together. And why Gary spent all but 2 1/2 of his last 22 
years on earth doing time. And why he despised Mikal's attempts to stop the 
firing squad from doing its ugly job. Indeed, when he was arrested for 
murdering those two young Mormon men in Provo, Gary was on his way back home to 
Portland to kill Mikal because he thought the baby of the family had escaped 
the curse of being a Gilmore. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mikal had not, and never will. For he will always hear Gary on Death Row 
asking him, "Where were you 10 years ago when I needed you?" Likewise, he will 
always remember the day his father dragged him off to live in a Seattle fleabag 
and how Gaylen, displaced by Mikal as the favorite son, warned him, "Someday 
he'll hate you, too." Cancer killed the old man before that could happen, but 
he left his mark on Mikal anyway, left him with a chilling capacity to walk 
away from anyone, be it lover, brother or mother. 
</P>
<P>
 It is what Mikal hates most about the hand his family dealt him. 
Unfortunately, his response in "Shot in the Heart" is too often self-pity. Not 
that he hasn't earned the right to a healthy dose of it, but excess is excess, 
and he seems to sense it even if he can't bring himself to admit it. He knows 
that, for all the courage it took to wrestle with his family's demons, he is 
still no hero. 
</P>
<P>
 If any of the Gilmores fits that description, it is Mikal's oldest brother, 
Frank Jr., who suffered so much so regularly that he might well have become a 
killer himself. It isn't just that his father beat him, it is that he also 
stepped forward to take beatings that Gary deserved. But there was never any 
reward for Frank Jr. The old man belittled the magic tricks he loved doing, his 
mother called the girl who might have become his wife a whore, and he never 
took up the carpenter's trade for fear it would somehow be taken away from him. 
And yet he was the only one of the brothers who stayed by his mother's side as 
she lay dying, the only one who always tried to do the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Jr. disappeared once Bessie was in her grave, and Mikal didn't see him 
for the next 10 years. When they were finally reunited, Mikal found a shy, 
withdrawn man who had endured homelessness, drinking problems and street 
violence. But the essential goodness of old remained. No matter how painful the 
past was to him, Frank Jr. helped his kid brother peel away its layers and 
comprehend its cruel mysteries. In doing so, he proved that even when there is 
no escape, there can be nobility. Mikal thanked him the only way he could. He 
dedicated his book to Frank Gilmore Jr.

THE DEBATE GETS A BIT HAIRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Samuel Greengard's consultation with a hair maven proves that he's suffering 
from only one malady: surplus discretionary income ("Brushing Up," Palm 
Latitudes, May 1). Examination of his hair follicle under a "Microviewer" is 
probably even less useful than scrutinizing a chicken's innards to get a 
glimpse of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Undoubtedly, if Greengard was required to pay a reputable dermatologist for 
the diagnosis and treatment of a real scalp problem, he would balk at the price 
and leave the office in a huff, declaring: "Bill my insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 If I had just shelled out $275 for a shampoo and a fistful of worthless 
nostrums, I would be mortified to tell my wife, let alone the entire Sunday 
reading public of the Los Angeles Times. "Trapped oil eating the follicle" -- 
my duff! This Rube's value system needs some serious adjustment.

THOUGHT FOR FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I can forgive -- barely -- trendy writing in pieces like "Night Crawlers" 
(Fashion, May 1), but please spare me S. Irene Virbila's Vanity Fair prose in 
reviewing restaurants ("Fabulous Breakfasts, Splendid Lunches" (May 1). In her 
L'Orangerie paragraph, we're treated to: "Ignore the the ambitiously blond 
starlet in the red leather mini . . . ." What the hell does that mean? How can 
one be ambitiously blond? And regarding Valentino: "When I find myself missing 
Italy . . . ." When I find myself missing Italy, I usually have missed the 
turnoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Can't you find someone to give us honest food reviews and leave out the chic, 
self-serving baloney. As for allowing Michel Richard at Citrus to do her 
ordering: When I'm at Citrus and Richard is there, I try to have him order for 
me, but he always asks: "Do I know you?"

 Without listing prices, Virbila provides the names of 24 restaurants that she 
recommends for breakfast or lunch, most of which are the most expensive and 
formal in town. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that if 
you're willing to spend as much as $50 to $60 for lunch, you can expect to see 
swans swimming by. What readers might find more useful would be the discovery 
of more creative and affordable places -- restaurants that put a fresh slant on 
the same old bacon-and-eggs fare. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing wrong with the inclusion, for balance, of one or two of the 
more luxurious, trendy and pricey places. But Virbila's articles seem to be 
targeted strictly at those to whom time and money are no object. In view of 
today's harsh economy, who wants to wear a tux to breakfast?

 I've gradually come to the conclusion that your magazine is only for the 
wealthy. Even Linda Burum's report on "Street Food" doesn't cite the cost of a 
single muffin or poached egg. Most of the customers found at those places are 
people to whom the cost of food is of major importance.

 We residents of Redondo Beach take exception to Virbila calling our neighbor 
to the south, Laguna Beach, the St. Tropez of California. While Laguna Beach 
has zinc-topped tables and warblers, it has neither a harbor nor marinas, as do 
St. Tropez and Redondo Beach. The latter, too, has the ambience of a 
Mediterranean beach resort, with nearly as many espresso and croissant stops 
per mile as any town along the Cote d'Azur.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A magnificent and awesome military operation, and a moment of acute symbolism 
as the liberation of Europe began, D-day itself was not a great battle by the 
bloody standards of modern war. 
</P>
<P>
 At Omaha Beach, the scene of the worst confusion if not the hardest fighting 
of invasion day, the Americans had 2,220 casualties, mainly from the Rangers 
and the 1st Division. At Utah Beach, where the terrain was less hostile and the 
defenders more demoralized, the American 4th Division suffered 187 casualties. 
These amounted to about 5% of their losses in the training disaster earlier in 
the year at Slapton Sands. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the U.S. Marines had lost 3,500 men in the amphibious assault on 
the single Japanese-held island of Tarawa. These casualty figures are collated 
by Stephen Ambrose, best known as the biographer of Eisenhower and Nixon; and 
for someone looking for just one among the flood of D-day books, his is the one 
to obtain. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet Ambrose never really proves the contention of his subtitle, that D-day 
was "the climactic battle of World War II." This is partly because of a 
fundamental change in the way military history is now written. Historians used 
to rely on the maps and the plans and the orders of generals, in which armies 
are portrayed by arrows sweeping around flanks. 
</P>
<P>
 But the surging growth of oral history in the recollections of individual 
soldiers has changed our perspective. A style of modern history pioneered by 
Cornelius Ryan, whose 30-year-old "The Longest Day" still reads marvelously 
well, this grunt's-eye view of chaos, blood and panic interspersed with moments 
of boredom and humor, is how battles are experienced. But they are not the full 
story of the way wars are decided. 
</P>
<P>
 And World War II was not decided on the Normandy beaches. On June 23, just 17 
days after D-day, Hitler's Army Group Centre on the Eastern Front lost five 
divisions (over 50,000 men) at Vitebsk alone. Part of Operation Bagration, this 
parallel and simultaneous Soviet battle that smashed the German army and 
cleared the way to Warsaw, puts D-day into proportion. Until the invasion, the 
British and U.S. troops never faced more than a dozen German divisions. Even 
after D-day, they never fought more than 60. The Red Army fought and beat over 
200 divisions and the bulk of the panzer armies. 
</P>
<P>
 The great merit of Gerhard Weinberg's monumental history of the war as a whole 
is to remind us of the vast sweep of the conflict, industrial as well as 
strategic. In Stephen Ambrose's riveting book, this industrial component of 
D-day is brought home when he quotes the comment of Gen. Eisenhower that "the 
man who won the war for us" was Andrew Higgins. In the teeth of official 
opposition, he designed, built and forced into production the essential landing 
craft. 
</P>
<P>
 From the almost token chapters given to the non-American role in D-day in this 
spate of 50th anniversary books, a casual reader might miss the fact that the 
Americans were a minority of the invading force. The Canadians at Juno Beach 
suffered rather worse than had the Americans at Omaha, losing 1,200 men, or one 
in 18 of those committed, compared to the U.S. loss of one in 19 up the coast 
at Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, compared to the first serious test of Hitler's coastal defenses, the 
disastrous Dieppe raid in 1942, Juno Beach was a cakewalk. At Dieppe, the 2nd 
Canadian Division had taken more than 6,000 casualties in six hours. And the 
British, thanks in part to their special tanks, took only 630 casualties at 
Sword Beach and about 400 at Gold Beach, as they put 55,000 men ashore. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the exception of the Americans at Omaha, who stumbled upon the good 
Wehrmacht units of General Kraiss' 352nd Division, the Allies were fighting a 
ragbag force, the gleanings on which Hitler depended after five years of war. 
</P>
<P>
 At Utah Beach, Lt. Robert Brewer of the 101st Airborne captured four Koreans 
in German uniform. Originally conscripted by the Japanese, they had been 
captured and forced to fight by the Red Army, and then captured yet again and 
made to fight by the Germans. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the invasion, every sixth rifleman in the Wehrmacht forces in 
France was from an "Ost" battalion, captured Russians and Poles and Ukrainians 
and Balts. Germany was exhausted. The average age of the troops in the 709th 
Division, based in the Cotentin peninsula, was 36. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not just luck that put the Allied troops ashore in Normandy, where the 
defenses were relatively feeble, but planning. The best German troops, the six 
panzer divisions, were stuck in the Pas de Calais, where Hitler believed the 
real invasion was coming. A complex deception operation, with fake radio 
signals from fake Headquarters, succeeded brilliantly in fooling the Germans. 
</P>
<P>
 But if those Panzer divisions were not available to repel the invasion in its 
most vulnerable first few hours, they had to be fought later, in the 
long-grinding battles of June and July as the Allies tried to break out from 
their beachhead. Under Gen. Montgomery, the British attacks repeatedly failed. 
But they drew to their front around Caen the bulk of the German armor, opening 
the way for the Americans under Gen. Omar Bradley and Gen. George Patton to 
break out into the heart of France. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigel Hamilton's new book on Montgomery, an edited and truncated version of 
his three-volume biography, refights the rather silly postwar squabble of the 
Allied generals and their memoirs. Yes, Monty was a crotchety and arrogant ally 
who stretched the truth to claim that he had planned the American breakout all 
along. But with his first command decision in January of 1944, insisting that 
the Allied assault be made with five divisions rather than three, Monty 
probably won the battle. 
</P>
<P>
 The point about D-day was that it was not a single event, but part of a long 
campaign. With hindsight, we might even say that for the future, the battle of 
Arnhem three months later in September, 1944, was more significant. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnhem was a battle that concerned far more than the defeat of Germany; it was 
about the postwar map of Europe. The goal was for the British and American 
armies to use an airborne landing to bounce their way across the Rhine and into 
the heart of Germany before winter set in. The ambition was clear. With 
Germany's industrial heartland of the Ruhr under their guns, the 
Anglo-Americans could occupy Germany before the Russians did. Defeat at Arnhem 
kept the Western Allies on the wrong side of the Rhine until the spring of 1945 
and helped define the parameters of the Cold War itself. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was not how it felt for the lonely parachutists, landing in the 
blackness of a hostile Normandy night. It was not how it seemed for the 
bewildered infantry of the U.S. 1st Division, dumped ashore at the wrong place, 
under intense fire and with most of their tanks sinking to the seabed. 
</P>
<P>
 For that flavor of D-day, Russell Miller's "Nothing Less Than Victory" is the 
most useful account, with each interview telling a coherent soldier's tale. 
Richard Goldstein, Ronald Drez and Gerald Astor have produced almost 
interchangeable narratives, peppered with ill-organized and random individual 
reminiscence. 
</P>
<P>
 Collectively, they show how not to use the rich archives of oral history, the 
largest collection of individual accounts of a single battle anywhere in the 
world, which are now gathered at the National D-Day Museum at New Orleans. 
Stephen Ambrose's book relies rather than depends upon them, using the intense 
personal perspective to illuminate a battle that amounted to rather more than 
the sum of individual experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 It took another 11 months of fighting, but D-day began the great peace that 
began to civilize Europe. It marked the moment when the fractious and warlike 
European tribes began to come under the adult supervision of the United States 
and Soviet Union, two superpowers with far too much at stake to permit the 
endless squabbles of the Old World to rise again. 
</P>
<P>
 More than just a peace, a kind of miracle emerged, in which the Europeans laid 
aside their martial pasts and adapted comfortably to the extraordinary new role 
of an economic giant that chose -- perhaps for the first time in history -- not 
to spend that wealth on becoming a military superpower. 
</P>
<P>
 The real essence of that European decision, whatever the inter-alliance 
squabbles along the way, was trust in the Americans as an honorable ally and a 
reliable custodian of the stability and the democratic hopes of Europe. And the 
real meaning of D-day was that it symbolized the moment when that trust was 
earned, in blood.

BONUSES FOR SOME; FOR OTHERS THE BONES

 Regarding "The Great Race" (by Nora Zamichow, May 1): Let me make sure I have 
this straight. In order to finish the Santa Monica Freeway repairs ahead of 
schedule, thereby making a multimillion-dollar bonus, contractor C. C. Myers 
had to persuade his ironworkers to toil even harder than they were already 
working (12-hour shifts, seven days a week).To achieve that, he paid a total of 
20 men a total of $1,000 and treated them to a catered Italian meal. 
</P>
<P>
 So he makes an extra $14 million, and his workers make an extra 50 bucks each. 
Gee, what a generous guy! It's a wonder everybody doesn't want to work for him

<P>
 In spite of Myers' multimillion-dollar bonuses for finishing the freeway 
repairs early, I have neither seen nor heard any mention of "thousands of 
dollars in bonuses" having been awarded the teams of ironworkers, carpenters, 
finishers and laborers as their share of the bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 Overtime pay couldn't begin to compensate the workers for the wear and tear 
and exhaustion of those 66 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on Myers and the supervisors of the ironworkers for spreading no more 
than $1,000 among 20 workers. All of those 400 workers were entitled to and 
should have gotten real bonuses.

RICHARD EDER: SOME THINGS ARE UNFORGIVABLE; A MAP OF THE WORLD, BY JANE 
HAMILTON (DOUBLEDAY: $22; 390 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a patch of Wisconsin woods, late on a summer afternoon, two women stand a 
few feet apart, each leaning her back against a tree and swatting mosquitoes. 
They face the same direction; neither looks at the other. They were best 
friends but Alice had a moment of distraction while minding Theresa's baby, 
Lizzie, and the child wandered off and drowned in the farm pond. Now, days 
later, Alice is almost mute while Theresa talks wildly, trivially, unstoppably: 
a frozen swimmer and a thrashing swimmer in a pond of bottomless pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Still thrashing, Theresa relates her visit to a former priest who was her high 
school teacher and whom she once had a crush on. Albert -- married, divorced 
and grown fat -- took her to a luncheonette for Cherry Cokes. Insistently, he 
made her tell the entire story of her 2-year-old daughter's life, and write 
down each of the 57 words she had mastered. By the time Theresa finished, she 
realized that what Lizzie had was not a fragment of a life but an entire one, 
though short. She and Albert -- now weeping for the child he has helped make 
real -- began to rock "just hard enough so that one edge of the booth came up 
like a swing set will, you know, that isn't grounded in cement?" 
</P>
<P>
 Still frozen, Alice thinks: "Theresa was going to talk at high speed through 
the seasons, through the rain and sleet and snow, until she was briny and then 
moss covered." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not the Job-like accumulation of scourges upon Alice Goodwin and her 
farmer husband, Howard, that makes Jane Hamilton's second novel remarkable. Not 
that the scourges are trivial. There could be no more terrible combination of 
agony and shame than to know that a moment of absent-mindedness has allowed the 
death of a friend's child. Or than to be arrested and charged immediately 
afterward -- as Alice is -- with sexually abusing children at the school where 
she works as a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the accumulation -- the neighbors turn bitterly vindictive, the 
Goodwin's children are traumatized and Howard loses the farm that has been his 
life's dream -- is as melodramatic and arbitrary as a soap opera. But then, so 
was Job's story ( boils , yet?). It is not the particular blows of providence 
that exalt the Old Testament story, but a man's voice protesting the pain of 
our cosmic vulnerability. In "A Map of the World," it is not the buildup of the 
two tragedies that is most distinctive -- the events are told with brilliant 
horror but their sequence and linkages can be awkward -- it is the different 
calligraphies they inscribe on Alice, Howard and Theresa. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the same horror is at the root of Sue Miller's "The Good Mother" (a 
woman's lover is accused of sexually abusing her daughter) and Rosellen Brown's 
"Before and After" (a family is shattered when a teen-age son is charged with 
murder). All three show how the outside world -- society, the law -- can make 
our privacies public and unrecognizable to ourselves. Or as Howard muses at one 
point: "I was dazed by the equation that overnight made Alice's troubles into 
everyone's troubles." 
</P>
<P>
 The difference is the voices. Theresa's out of the circle of trees: wandering, 
coming apart and coming together to relate a remarkable deliverance by a fat 
man in a luncheonette booth; remarkable, among other things, for being both a 
near-miracle and entirely natural. Alice's, frozen in shame as well as grief -- 
and in her own knotted nature -- raging at Theresa's. This is only one example; 
throughout, "A Map of the World" will suddenly alter its light, revealing 
beneath the fabric of its characters' lives, thoughts and emotions a kind of 
X-ray of their souls. 
</P>
<P>
 The story is told alternately by Alice and Howard. Alice begins with an 
account of a precarious idyll. She and Howard, former hippies, more or less, 
have bought a farm in a transitional area. Suburbs are encroaching; the 
old-style rural community of Howard's dreams no longer quite exists. Instead of 
helping with the haying, the neighbors are more likely to get up petitions 
about the farm's noise, smells and effect on property values. 
</P>
<P>
 For Howard, a dairy farm is heaven, down to its most menial and exhausting 
jobs. "I always thought that work was as common and fine as air," he will say. 
Alice can't quite submerge in his Arcadian dream; there is tension under the 
determinedly upbeat account of their life that starts the book off. Tension 
becomes horror the day Theresa leaves Lizzie with her. Hamilton slows the 
narrative to nightmare speed: Suddenly Lizzie is no longer in the room with her 
older sister and Alice's two children. She thinks of the pond, runs there on 
suddenly heavy legs, her bare feet "like two pink erasers." A pink gingham 
bottom bobs on the water's surface, 15 feet out. 
</P>
<P>
 Days of breakdown follow. Alice's account of her paralysis -- she can't take 
care of the children, endure the funeral, visit Theresa or do much besides 
sleep; and Howard's patience turns to despair -- is another nightmare. It ends, 
oddly enough, and she goes from lethargy to hyper-activity, when the second 
horror falls upon the first. 
</P>
<P>
 The police come and arrest her. A 9-year-old schoolboy, a problem child who at 
one point goaded her into slapping him, has reported that she fondled him. The 
account seems inspired and promoted by his dysfunctional, promiscuous mother; 
but a communal hysteria sets in. There are other complaints, a formal charge, 
months in prison -- until Howard sells the farm to pay the exorbitant bail -- 
and finally a trial that frees her into a life of utterly change and uncertain 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the story limps a bit. The courtroom scenes are compellingly taut, but 
not especially distinctive. Alice's eccentric lawyer is a grotesque that 
doesn't quite come off. He serves, though, to parody the processes of the law, 
and as part of Hamilton's questioning of the nature of present-day society. The 
dream of community is no longer viable; people live by fashion and slogans. The 
mere mention of abuse -- in the absence of social ties and the ground-knowledge 
that they instill -- is enough to set off a conflagration. 
</P>
<P>
 Such questions, though provocative, are no more the real heart of the book 
than the plot is, or the accomplished set scenes, among them a vivid account of 
Alice's time in jail, and of the brutal and sometimes compassionate social 
order set up by the inmates. Alice's harsh, illuminating vision -- released 
from jail, she and Howard pass a wedding and she notes: "The bride had some 
teeth missing. Maybe she'll be covered by her husband's dental plan. Maybe 
she'll be able to get them fixed" -- is a poetry of despair that turns, in a 
stunning final passage, into something like a chorale. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard's account of his time alone with the children as he struggles to keep 
his farm going, is only seemingly matter-of-fact. It is another kind of poetry, 
bucolic and sad. Theresa, passionate but purposeful -- she and Howard fall in 
love and relinquish it in one single, powerfully erotic and entirely chaste 
movement -- is a child of light. Her poetry is of a third order; like Eric 
Rohmer's films, its magic takes form from what is random, commonplace and 
disconnected.

EASY RAWLINS, JUST A LITTLE OLDER; BLACK BETTY, BY WALTER MOSLEY (W.W. NORTON: 
$19.95; 255 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ernest J. Gaines, Ernest J. Gaines's most recent novel is is A Lesson Before 
Dying (Alfred A. Knopf). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1961, John F. Kennedy was president of the United States, Martin Luther 
King was leading civil rights demonstrators in Alabama and Georgia, and Easy 
Rawlins was searching for Black Betty out of South Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black Betty" is Walter Mosley's latest novel, and Easy Rawlins is his private 
eye, just as Phillip Marlowe was alter ego for Raymond Chandler in that same 
city, and Sam Spade served that purpose for Dashiell Hammet four hundred and 
some miles farther north in San Francisco. I mention Chandler and Hammett and 
their private detectives, Marlowe and Spade, because I think Mosley and Rawlins 
fit that mold. The writer and his private eye are tough, shrewd, and 
knowledgeable about their cities, and they know the things, the good and the 
bad, that makes those cities move. 
</P>
<P>
 Easy Rawlins is raising two adopted children -- Jesus, a little Mexican boy he 
rescued from a brothel, and Feather, a little girl of mixed black and white 
parentage, and Easy is doing all he can as a single parent to bring them up 
well. Easy is originally from the South and he cooks his children scrambled 
eggs, grits and bacon for breakfast, and hamburgers at night -- when he is at 
home. When he is in the streets searching for Black Betty, an assignment 
offered him by Saul Lynx, a white private detective of suspicious honesty (who 
thinks Rawlins can get more information than he in black South Central L.A.), 
then Easy Rawlins can be as tough with the bad guys as he is tender with his 
children who are always on his mind. He keeps reminding himself that he ought 
to give up this line of work and get a regular job to support himself and his 
two children -- but at present he needs the money that Saul Lynx is paying him 
to find Black Betty. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two or three stories going on in the novel, and it can become a 
little annoying, especially when you can't make the connection. But the writing 
is so good, and the characters that Mosley is constantly introducing are so 
interesting that you can't put the book down. Mosley describes people and 
things very well, and he has a tremendous ear for dialogue. His description of 
the homes of the haves and have nots of Los Angeles, and his description of 
that hot Santa Ana wind, and of the desert (of a single flower in the desert) 
is as good as you would find in Chandler at his best. And his dialogue is just 
as good, whether he is dealing with the hoods in the street, or the police, or 
children, or matrons in their grand Beverly Hills mansions. 
</P>
<P>
 In his search for Black Betty, Easy Rawlins comes up against more bad people 
than anyone should have to meet. Saul Lynx is a shadowy figure himself, but he 
is only a shadow compared to some of the others who are real, evil and brutal. 
The little men all have guns, and the big ones use their muscles. Mouse is 
small and he is just out of jail. He is looking for someone to kill, and Easy 
Rawlins is on his short list. Easy has to prove to Mouse that he was not 
responsible for sending him to jail. Mouse only half believes him, so Easy has 
to find the real culprit. Another bad guy is "Commander" Stiles of the Los 
Angeles police department, who likes getting information with his fist when you 
are not expecting it, and, even if you are, you are surprised at his sudden 
move. Then there is Calvin Hodge, the Texas lawyer who represents the people 
who are trying to find Black Betty. Hodge likes to call the 41-year-old black 
detective "boy," and he has the size and build to back up his words. There are 
others, just as cruel, and they leave enough dead bodies to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 After all this, I was mildly disappointed when I first met Black Betty. Maybe 
I expected too much, too many drums and trumpets. She does not sing an aria, 
nor does she give us a soliquy. But what she does is wrap up things. There are 
a couple more little murders on the side after she comes on stage, but she 
gives us the answers to the main story, which is why she had to leave the 
mansion after a sudden death in the family. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mosley is not quite satisfied that Black Betty has given us all the 
answers. He feels that we need to know more about the remaining characters, and 
I think he did this hurriedly. He felt that he needed to tell us more about 
Mouse and some of the others when I don't think it was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 This novel can be read as a simple detective story, and it can be seen as a 
comment on a people, place and time, as any good piece of fiction should be. 
Though the civil rights movement in the South is hardly ever mentioned -- and 
certainly no character speaks to prophesy the Watts Riots -- Easy Rawlins and 
other blacks in South Central suffer many of the same indignities that 
their/our brothers were suffering in the Southern part of the United States at 
that same time. Maybe this is what Mosley was doing, using the search for Black 
Betty as a means to let Easy Rawlins show us the L.A. of 1961 -- while 
predicting what could happen 30 years later. I wouldn't go so far as to say 
that that is the meaning of the book, but all the undercurrents are there. 
Blacks play subordinate roles in all cases, unless they are in their own 
neighborhood. There are lines that separate the poor from the well-off, and 
there are cops to enforce that rule. The explosion happened in '62, but the pot 
had been simmering 30 years earlier and more. 
</P>
<P>
 Easy Rawlins is 41 now after this fourth book, and he is tired. He wishes to 
spend more time with his two adopted children, and less time beating up, and 
being beatened up, by the bad people. But I along with thousands of others hope 
he doesn't give up the private eye business altogether. Marlowe was good, but 
he gave us information from one point of view, the white point of view. Easy 
Rawlins has access to places Marlowe would not dare tread. I like Marlowe and I 
like Spade -- but we need Easy out there. Look after your children, Easy -- but 
don't forget us. They Leave You Alone in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, in an excerpt from Walter Mosley's "Black Betty," is the Los Angeles 
Easy Rawlins lives in:  
</P>
<P>
 You could tell by some people's houses that they came to L.A. to live out 
their dreams. Home is not a place to dream. At home you had to do like your 
father did and your mother. Home meant that everybody already knew what you 
could do and if you did the slightest little thing different they'd laugh you 
right down into a hole. You lived in that hole. Festered in t. After a while 
you either accepted your hole or you got out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 There were all kinds of ways out. You could get married, get drunk, get next 
to somebody's wife. You could take a shotgun and eat it for a midnight snack. 
</P>
<P>
 Or you could move to California. 
</P>
<P>
 In California they wouldn't laugh at you, or anybody. In California the sun 
shone three hundred and more days in the year. In California you could work 
until you dropped. And when you got up there was another job waiting for you. 
</P>
<P>
 In California you could paint the slats of your house like a rainbow and put a 
smiling face on your front door. You could have a caged rabbit and chickens 
right out in the yard and big granite animals for children to climb on. You 
could, like Georgette Harris, put a sign on your wire gate saying "Little 
Animals Nursery School and Day Care." Nobody cared. Nobody asked you, "What 
makes you a schoolteacher?" They'd just take you at your word. And if the law 
came down and asked for some papers you'd just move a mile or so further on, 
hang up the same sign, and collect children like a crow taking in glass.

VON HALDEMAN AND THE P; THE HALDEMAN DIARIES: INSIDE THE NIXON WHITE HOUSE, BY 
H.R. HALDEMAN (PUTNAM: $27.50; 684 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ronald J. Ostrow, Staff writer Ronald J. Ostrow covered Watergate for The 
Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The day-to-day journal that H.R. "Bob" Haldeman kept of his years as White 
House chief of staff for Richard M. Nixon could serve as a how-to manual for 
the ultimate aide, at least as Haldeman defined that task: accomplishing the 
impossible without showing a trace of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Haldeman's formidable tasks were: to shield President Nixon from the 
near-paranoia of his national security adviser, Henry A. Kissinger, repeatedly 
expressed in threats to resign over what Kissinger saw as Secretary of State 
William P. Rogers' undercutting and upstaging him; to handle Nixon's obsession 
and dissatisfaction with the PR side of the White House down to the level of 
plotting against a reporter he perceived as an enemy; to sound out Nixon's 
favorite Democrat, John Connally, about replacing Spiro Agnew as vice president 
if a way could be found to ease Agnew out before the first term was finished. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than detailing excesses of the Nixon Presidency that until now went 
unreported or incompletely told, Haldeman's contemporaneous recording of what 
took place during his four years and three months at the White House reveals a 
side of "Von Haldeman," as he jokingly dubs himself, unknown to the public: 
Some of Nixon's actions and style left him stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 This powerful chief of staff claims to have eschewed any role in 
policy-making. This denial turns out to be at best exaggerated modesty. We read 
in the diaries that he urged Nixon to bomb Hanoi and to carry out the Cambodian 
incursion. But to hear him describe his role, his greatest contribution lay in 
"frequently" having to decide whether to obey a presidential order. "I 
sometimes decided not to, on the basis that it was not an order that was really 
intended to be carried out, but rather a letting off of steam, or that it was 
clearly not in the P's (his diary symbol for Nixon) interest that it be carried 
out. Usually I later informed P that the order had not been followed, and he 
usually agreed that was the right decision. There were times, however, when he 
intentionally would end-run me with an order to someone else who he felt would 
do his bidding when I wouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 At times, Haldeman's critical entries describe minor missteps, such as Nixon's 
instruction that a presidential dinner for Duke Ellington's birthday include 
"all the jazz greats, like Guy Lombardo." Haldeman can't resist an "oh well!" 
</P>
<P>
 Other mistakes, such as Nixon's "incredible" (as Haldeman described it) 
statement that then-accused multiple killer Charles Manson was guilty before 
his case went to the jury, had potentially more serious consequences. The 
comment came during a presidential trip: "He was trying to make point about 
media responsibility for glorifying criminals, but it came out wrong," Haldeman 
recorded. "We had quite a time on Air Force One trying to work out a 
correction. P had (Attorney General) John Mitchell and E (White House Counsel 
John D. Ehrlichman) write up a statement." 
</P>
<P>
 The diaries, which Haldeman recorded first in longhand and later by dictation, 
represent a prodigious effort, the entries having been made each night after 
12- to 14-hour workdays. Haldeman died last Nov. 12, having worked full-time in 
the last year of his life on preparing the diaries to publish in condensed 
version in this book and in their entirety on CD-ROM. His widow, Jo, completed 
the work. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who lived through the Nixon Presidency, Haldeman's telegraphic-style 
entries bring the period back to life. For those who covered the Nixon 
Presidency, the diaries fill out what had only been hinted at and in some 
matters provide new information. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the case of fundamentalist preacher Billy Graham. It is well known that 
he was a longtime Nixon friend and confidant. But the degree to which he served 
as a White House political adviser has not previously been recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 After a Feb. 1, 1972, prayer breakfast, Graham and Nixon discuss "the terrible 
problem arising from the total Jewish domination of the media," and agree "that 
this was something that would have to be dealt with," Haldeman reports. On July 
20, 1972, Graham calls to report information of vital interest to the Nixon 
White House -- that there was almost no chance the ailing Gov. George Wallace 
would run for president, based on a conversation that Graham had with Wallace. 
The P earlier had told Haldeman that "Graham has a line to Wallace through Mrs. 
Wallace, who has become a Christian. Billy will talk to Wallace whenever we 
want him to." And in a later entry, as Haldeman and Ehrlichman resign under the 
pressure of Watergate, Graham tells Haldeman he had not met two finer men in 
government and that "we've been caught in a web of evil that will ultimately be 
defeated." 
</P>
<P>
 As intriguing as such disclosures are, they fall short of achieving the status 
of "an invaluable asset to historians and scholars" that Haldeman's friend and 
presidential scholar Robert Rutland predicted they would when he urged Haldeman 
to undertake the effort. The largest shortcoming is that Haldeman classified 
his journal "Top Secret," which led to a review of the full text by the 
National Security Council, and deletions of "sensitive 
national-security-related material." 
</P>
<P>
 Historian and Nixon biographer Stephen E. Ambrose, who in an introduction to 
the book rates it "a priceless document," nevertheless said the government 
censorship "is infuriating." In addition, the 684-page volume is indexed only 
by name and not by subject, frustrating any student seriously interested in the 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Watergate is the only period for which Haldeman said he included all his diary 
entries in the final product. Nearly two years after Haldeman resigned as chief 
of staff, he was convicted in federal court of conspiracy, obstruction of 
justice and perjury. His 2 1/2- to 8-year sentence was cut to 1 to 4 years, and 
he was paroled after serving 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing has been deleted to hide the truth, painful as it sometimes is," 
Haldeman wrote in the foreword. "Although this book represents only about 40% 
of the full text (of all the diaries), it includes virtually every word I wrote 
about Watergate." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the asserted completeness of the Watergate entries, they offer no new 
information. In fact, they underscore Haldeman's failure to recognize that his 
actions and those of his chief executive only days after the break-in by 
Republican operatives at the Democrats' Watergate offices constituted a 
cover-up -- or obstruction of justice as a federal grand jury would describe 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never set out to construct a planned, conscious cover-up operation," 
Haldeman writes as the Watergate entries begin. "We reacted to Watergate just 
as we had to the Pentagon Papers, ITT and the Laos/Cambodia operations. We were 
highly sensitive to any negative PR, and our natural reaction was to contain, 
or minimize, any potential political damage. Our attempts at containment became 
linked to other acts within the Administration and were eventually labeled 'the 
Watergate cover-up.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Haldeman seemed to indicate otherwise in his June 20, 1972, entry, three 
days after the break-in. He told of meeting with Ehrlichman and Mitchell, who 
by then had left the Justice Department to head the Nixon reelection committee, 
and Atty. Gen. Richard G. Kleindienst and counsel to the president John W. Dean 
III: "The conclusion was that we've got to hope the FBI doesn't go beyond 
what's necessary in developing evidence and that we can keep a lid on that, as 
well as keeping all the characters involved from getting carried away with any 
unnecessary testimony." (Italics are the reviewer's.) 
</P>
<P>
 And in his entry for June 23, 1972, the day of the so-called smoking gun tape 
on which Nixon is heard to instruct Haldeman to use the CIA to head off the FBI 
Watergate investigators, Haldeman gives little indication that the President 
gave him such an order. That tape subsequently became crucial in persuading 
Nixon to resign rather than face impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Haldeman notes cryptically: "The FBI is convinced it's the CIA that's 
doing this, and (acting FBI Director L. Patrick) Gray's looking for a way out 
of the investigation. So we talked to (CIA Deputy Director Vernon) Walters and 
had that worked out." 
</P>
<P>
 But in his July 6, 1972 entry, Haldeman, discussing a 2-hour meeting he held 
with the P and Ehrlichman on "the Watergate caper problem," said "Walters 
apparently has finked out and spilled the beans to Pat Gray, which complicates 
the issue substantially." 
</P>
<P>
 An editor's note elaborates: "Walters had met with Gray, but told him the CIA 
had no interest in Watergate. Also, that he thought people in the White House 
or CRP (Committee to Reelect the President) were covering something up, with 
which Gray agreed. The President had told him to go ahead with his 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 While Haldeman's diaries shed no new light on Watergate, they make startlingly 
clear the degree to which the White House manipulated Vice President Agnew -- 
and then reacted with horror when he grew beyond control; it reads as a sort of 
Frankenstein's-monster scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus when Agnew is pushing to deliver a speech by then Nixon aide Pat Buchanan 
declaring an end to the school desegregation movement, the P says he doesn't 
want him to "get out beyond his (Nixon's) own position, and thus become 
oversold as the Southern strategy man. Afraid to dilute or waste the great 
asset he has become," Haldeman records. 
</P>
<P>
 But only a year-and-a-half later, the White House is rejoicing over an 
estimate that there's a 3-out-of-4 chance Agnew will withdraw from the 
reelection ticket in 1972. Haldeman describes what Nixon sees as Agnew's 
problems: "he's dogmatic, his hidebound prejudices, totally inflexible, and . . 
. he sees things in minuscule terms." 
</P>
<P>
 Connally eventually says he does not want the job, and the P directs that 
Agnew be limited to appearances in the South and small states and be given no 
important duties. 
</P>
<P>
 After reelection, Haldeman describes Agnew's fighting for something meaningful 
to do, proposing a trip to Egypt to "untangle something on the Middle East. The 
P was obviously so astonished he didn't know quite how to answer the thing at 
first, but then made the point that it would be unwise for the VP to take the 
risk of being rebuffed at that high level." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of what to do with Agnew becomes moot as the vice president asks 
Haldeman to head off a kickback investigation of him by the U.S. attorney in 
Baltimore, a request that Haldeman rebuffs. Six months later, Agnew makes 
history by pleading no contest to a federal tax evasion charge and resigning as 
vice president. But by then, Haldeman had been forced out and faced harsher 
judicial action.

 Madge Sinclair was "flattered" to be asked to be involved. Talia Shire told 
her husband she was really lucky in life: "I have had the chance to work with 
the very best and that's a wonderful feeling." And Justine Bateman and Jasmine 
Guy found working on the fictional segments of TBS' "A Century of Women" to be 
a great learning experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Directed by Academy Award-winning Barbara Kopple, the fictional segments of 
the documentary follow the lives of four generations of women in one family. 
Teresa Wright, Olympia Dukakis, Talia Shire, Justine Bateman and Brooke Smith 
play the women who gather to celebrate the birth of Bateman's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Madge Sinclair and Jasmine Guy play mother and daughter -- African American 
friends who join in the celebration. Throughout the course of the gathering, 
they discuss the changes women have seen and fought for over the course of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me it just showed that everything starts with the family," Sinclair says 
of the fictional scene. "You can find every single instance of anything that 
happens in your life within the family. It only is multiplied to that many 
powers when it goes out in the community. Everything that happens in the 
community happens to the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Sinclair worried that her and Guy's characters were included to 
fill a quota. But then she realized their inclusion made perfect sense. "If we 
are talking about the journey of women, this is about where we have arrived at 
from a place where black women and white women could barely talk to each other 
in public, except if one was giving orders and the other was saying, 'Yes 
ma'am.' 
</P>
<P>
 "To have a family as closely knit as that one was to feel comfortable enough 
with these two women to invite them to a happening, I thought it was pretty 
nice and indicative to where I think we have arrived, which is a happy place." 
</P>
<P>
 The weeklong shoot brought all the actresses closer together. "I came out with 
such enormous respect for all of those women," Shire says. "It was hard to say 
goodby." 
</P>
<P>
 Guy recalls how much they talked about about their lives and careers when the 
cameras weren't rolling. "For me, Justine and Brooke Smith, to get a 
perspective from Olympia and Talia, I think, was really invaluable. At least 
where I am, I'm still trying to plot everything out and pursue specific goals. 
I think Olympia said to me one day, 'You can't plan this career. Your career 
just is.' It was a relief to know that because you are kind of fighting a 
losing battle thinking we are in control of this business." 
</P>
<P>
 Bateman believes the documentary is important for women her age. "I'm 28 and I 
need to see this stuff," she says. "I came into a world where I already had the 
vote. I already had equality -- the most equality we've had. And to see that 
this was hard won, I can be really grateful for where I am now." SUSAN KING

HISTORY RE-RIVETED

<P>
 Tina Hill is always asked the same question: Did she know she was making 
history when she became a "Rosie the Riveter" during World War II? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes and no. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I was making history for myself, but I didn't know I was making 
history for anyone else. Always as a little child, there were two or three 
things I always wanted in my house. I didn't want a leaky roof and I didn't 
want a lot of fussing and fighting. Up until now, I have had some leaks, but 
I've had no fighting!" 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, now 76 and living in Los Angeles, is among the women profiled on the 
first installment of TBS' six-hour "A Century of Women." The Texas native 
migrated to Los Angeles in 1940 to seek a better life. She found unheard-of 
economic freedom for a black woman when she began working in one of the many 
defense-industry facilities sprouting in Southern California during World War 
II. After the men returned from the war, she continued working at the plant, 
run by North American Aviation (now known as Rockwell). She retired in 1980, 
after 37 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't have a lot of jobs for black people then, especially women," Hill 
says. "Some of them had jobs working in the hotels. They had a few black 
teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 When Hill came to Los Angeles to stay with an aunt, all she could find was 
domestic work. Then came the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. "I went home and 
married my childhood sweetheart. He went into the service and I came back to 
Los Angeles again. They were hiring people, so I went to the plant and put in 
my application that day. 
</P>
<P>
 She applied at North American Aviation. "They hired me and they sent me to a 
training school for six weeks. They paid you the same thing as if you were 
working regular. That old 40 cents an hour was a lot of money. I would bring 
home about $16 a week." As a domestic, she earned $40 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 She was happy working at the plant, she recalls, "as long as I was making some 
money that was sufficient and I was able to spend it as I wanted to. I was home 
with my family when night came. That's what I liked." 
</P>
<P>
 World War II, she says, "helped every woman who was breathing air because they 
learned to manage things and do things. We just learned a lot. We learned how 
to do things we thought we couldn't do." 
</P>
<P>
 If there was racism at the plant, Hill says, "you couldn't show it. Roosevelt 
was a good President and he opened up the doors and things for us to go in 
these different places to work." Whites, she says, "didn't want us to get 
ahead. They wanted us to stay back. Hitler got the black woman out of the white 
woman's kitchen." SUSAN KING

 WATER by Sue Thomas. (Overlook: $21.95; 235 pp.) "Meeting the wrong man is 
like stepping into the waves of an ebb tide -- you feel the pull of the water 
beneath your feet and you're drawn to follow it.You know, of course, that when 
the tide turns you'll glance around to find yourself way out of your depth." So 
says Sue Thomas in "Water," a desolate, dreamy novel that is pulled along by 
the thread of emotion rather than the thread of story. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth and her teen-age daughter Julie have never quite recovered from being 
abandoned by Simon, Julie's father. Ruth is benignly delusional, while Julie, 
full of bitterness, has a secret life. All this is interspersed with italicized 
sections about fish, drowning and love. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an interesting surreal quality in "Water." Mythic. Although the rules 
of physics are never actually broken, it feels as if they might be any second. 
The one profoundly irritating aspect of Thomas' writing is the 
man-as-monster-woman-as-victim theme. Nobody forced these characters to "step 
into the waves of the ebb tide," or, put less delicately, to sleep with losers. 
They choose it. Perhaps those choices came out of a desperate attempt to 
assuage inner darkness, and that's sad, but it doesn't change the fact that 
abdication of responsibility may lead to a polemical novel.

 ONE KISS LED TO ANOTHER by Harris Dulany. (HarperCollins: X; pp.) When Con 
Leeds, a fast-talking, hard-drinking South Jersey PI, is hired to find the 
missing granddaughter of a rich business man, he has no reason to believe it is 
anything other than a straightforward runaway teen-ager situation. Wrong.After 
the girl is found dead, it seems that everyone she knew is full of differing 
and complex agendas. There's the pimp in a 12-step program, the DA turned biker 
and Julie, a gorgeous young woman who has sex and rage hopelessly confused. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris Dulany, author of "One Kiss Led to Another," keeps eccentric characters 
proliferating faster than dead bodies. Although the writing could use more 
adrenaline, it is, for the most part, smart solid and dependable. Protagonist, 
Con Leeds, tends to be somewhat cliched, but there is a certain old-dog comfort 
to be found in the tough detective with a heart of gold. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no big flaws in "One Kiss Led to Another," and the small ones do not 
seriously detract from it's overall success. Leeds sometimes behaves in ways 
that are less than sympathetic in becoming involved (primarily for sex) with a 
much, much younger woman who carries secret emotional scars that will be 
obvious to many astute readers. Another problem is the slightly languid pace. 
Yet clearly Dulany can write, and "One Kiss Led to Another" is an auspicious 
debut.

PRIME-TIME FLICKS

 The title characters of the 1990 film of Tom Stoppard's play Rosencrantz and 
Guildenstern Are Dead (KCET Sunday at 9 p.m.) are hazily familiar as the 
treacherous school fellows of Shakespeare's "Hamlet." The blithe Rosencrantz 
(Gary Oldman) and the icily glum Guildenstern (Tim Roth) have been mysteriously 
summoned to Elsinore. The unfolding of the familiar tragedy from a fresh 
perspective has struck some viewers as brilliantly literate, but be prepared to 
find it a little tedious. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1986 triumph-over-adversity TV movie Nobody's Child (KCAL Sunday at 10 
p.m.), Marlo Thomas is splendid as the real-life Marie Balter, who spent nearly 
20 years in a mental institution yet went on to get a master's degree from 
Harvard and work as a supervisor in a mental health agency. This film is 
special, thanks largely to director Lee Grant and Thomas, who is luminous in an 
unglamorous role. 
</P>
<P>
 A mother's skepticism over the mysterious death of her child in a foster home 
results in the foster mother being charged with murder in the well-made 1992 TV 
movie A Child Lost Forever (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.). Beverly D'Angelo tackles the 
role of the biological mother with gusto. This film is also based on an actual 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 As the riveting 1993 TV movie Men Don't Tell (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.) unfolds, 
we watch a violent, temperamental wife (Judith Light) increasingly use her 
husband (Peter Strauss) like a punching bag in a drama that turns wife abuse 
inside out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mambo Kings (KCOP Saturday at 6 p.m.) has such gaudy life we're willing to 
forgive its cliche acting, cartoonish emotions and an uncertain plot. None of 
this matters much in the face of this 1992 movie's ability to hook us into the 
sexy, sensual mambo music of the '50s. Armand Assante galvanizes the film with 
his recklessly dynamic presence. The quietly effective Antonio Banderas 
co-stars as his fellow rumba-loving Cuban emigre brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorraine Bracco, Harry Dean Stanton and Terence Stamp star in the 1991 
Stranger in the Family (ABC Saturday at 8 p.m.), which Stamp also directed. The 
film is based on the Patricia McDonald thriller about a woman whose kidnaped 
boy returns 10 years after his abduction, only to become the target of a madman 
who wants him dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Cool Hand Luke (KCOP Saturday at 8 p.m.) is that solid yet antic 1967 prison 
film with Paul Newman and an Oscar-winning George Kennedy.

 BROTHER SAM: The Short Spectacular Life of Sam Kinison by Bill Kinison with 
Steve Delsohn. (Morrow: $22; 315 pp.) Not everyone liked comedian Sam Kinison's 
brand of screaming, irreverent humor, but as a performer he was, without 
question, a true American original."Brother Sam," written by his older brother 
and manager, Bill Kinison, sets out to illuminate the man behind the agonized 
yell. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Kinison was a high school dropout, a traveling Pentecostal-style preacher 
(along with his father and brother) and a rebel. His comedy was connected to 
his rage by an unbroken line that made him a millionaire and simultaneously 
alienated much of the entertainment industry. He died in a car crash in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 This material, though compelling, feels so close to Bill Kinison's heart that 
it's almost impossible to see Sam. Instead we see Bill's Sam who is often 
tragic, funny, original and sharp, but not, one suspects, the same man that 
would have emerged if this book had been written by another person. Bill 
Kinison raised co-dependency to new heights, even accepting a drug sentence for 
Sam and attending five months of court-mandated rehab in his place. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of being both too close and not close enough, "Brother Sam" is a 
completely engaging biography. Bill Kinison spends exactly the right amount of 
time on each chapter of Sam's life, and although we hunger for input from other 
human sources, particularly his third wife, Malika, the book still manages to 
quote magazine articles and pieces of Sam's routines very effectively.

 REVIVING OPHELIA by Mary Pipher. (Putnam: $23.95; 320 pp.) According to 
clinical psychologist Mary Pipher, adolescent girls are in terrible 
trouble.Teen-age pregnancy, drug abuse, eating disorders, self mutilation and 
depression are all on the rise. The cause of this, Pipher contends, is to be 
found in today's society where "(Girls are) caught in myriad double binds: 
achieve, but not too much; be polite, but be yourself, be feminine and adult. . 
. . They are trained to be what the culture wants of its young women, not what 
they themselves want to become." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Reviving Ophelia," Pipher shines high-beam headlights on the world of 
teen-age girls by giving us case studies of adolescents from every possible 
racial and socio-economic background. The book is an articulate plea for better 
parenting, less violence and for all of us to " . . . work for a culture in 
which the incisive intellect, the willing hands and the happy heart are 
beloved." 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult to fault such a profoundly well-intentioned piece of work. Not 
only do Pipher's claims make sense, but her genuine kindness shows on every 
page. However, there are problems. Too many case studies go by too quickly, 
which saps much of their power. It might have been more effective to have fewer 
stories so that we could feel these young women as real people rather than 
illustrations of Pipher's points. Another disturbing trait is occasional 
statements such as, "One forth of all women are raped." Say what? Where did 
this statistic originate? How is rape being defined? Are these reported? How 
are unreported rapes calculated? "Reviving Ophelia" is an important book, 
which, one hopes, will find its way to the right audience.

 9 HIGHLAND ROAD by Michael Winerip. (Pantheon: $24; 464 pp.) Journalist 
Michael Winerip's, book, "9 Highland Road," an account of life in a group home 
for the mentally ill over a three-year period, is, in many ways, similar to a 
fairly intelligent nighttime soap.This has both advantages and drawbacks. On 
the plus side, there's an interesting, diverse cast, each member dealing with 
his or her own issues. The world of mental illness (like the world of doctors, 
lawyers or cops) is shown in a captivating way. There's a satisfying sense of 
closure. On the other hand, as in even a high-quality television drama, 
everything feels a bit sanitized. Relationships are complex enough to make you 
think, but only for a few minutes. Characters seem two- and three-quarters 
dimensional. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not to say there isn't a great deal to be learned here. Much of "9 
Highland Road," is truly compelling without ever being exploitative. In 
particular, the chapters dealing with one resident's multiple personality 
disorder are unforgettable. "Night after night the personality that caused the 
most turmoil by far was the five year old Scared One. Something awful had 
happened to Julie at five. Di, (another personality) who was four, effervescent 
and well adjusted, absolutely refused to celebrate her birthday. She was 
adamant about not turning five." Winerip's writing is smooth and pleasant 
although somewhat lacking in physical detail. "9 Highland Road" may either 
satisfy or frustrate depending on your expectations. This is a book that will 
stick to your ribs, but not your psyche.

 out in the land where women are main).

 Our blooming hero awoke,one day,

 he pondered a while and he said,said he

ON THE TOWN: A LONER'S LEAP; ON THAT MORNING, AT THAT CROSSROADS, THERE WAS NO 
TURNING BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lady, you nearly made a royal mess of what was left of my morning. 
</P>
<P>
 If you rate a mention on the 6 o'clock news this evening, I'll be too busy to 
know. But I expect that, within 24 hours, I'll know as much about you as will 
any halfway decent member of the news-reading public. An article is bound to 
appear someplace, with all your vital statistics and perhaps a few quotes from 
a grieving loved one speculating about why you took that dive from the Barham 
Boulevard overpass onto the northbound lanes of the Hollywood Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, I'd rather not know the details. My shocked imagination is writing 
and revising your death scenario, opting for the more pragmatic possibility 
that ultimately made me witness to the bloody aftermath of your irrevocable 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 My personal scenario is much more mundane. Day began with the transgression of 
oversleep. The alarm went off at 6:30, but it was 9:30 when I jumped up. I had 
barely enough time to bathe, dress and tend to pressing correspondence before 
leaving to make my usual run to the P.O. box and then an 11:20 appointment with 
my favorite dentist in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 I did a frantic leaving dance, double-checking to see if I had turned off all 
the lights and the Mr. Coffee, followed by a two-minute scramble for my 
eternally mislaid keys. If I'd been on time, I might've been behind the wheel 
of one of the vehicles that struck you and kept going. 
</P>
<P>
 In minutes, I was racing up Wilton toward the Hollywood Boulevard on-ramp. I 
figured it would take a mere 15 minutes to make Reseda, speeding ticket 
notwithstanding. But instead of merging with a light stream of traffic, I waded 
into a bumper-to-bumper jam. I made a quick exit at Cahuenga. Finding a pay 
phone (haven't gone cellular yet), I got the receptionist. She green-lighted 
the hasty rescheduling of my appointment, giving me another 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Zipping back up Cahuenga, parallel to the freeway, I was dismayed to discover 
even worse gridlock before the entrance ramp, which was closed. A small white 
hatchback weaved boldly through the Day-Glo orange cones, violating the 
Caltrans dictate. Equally brazen, I forced my way into the slightly 
faster-moving left lanes. Relaxed into the incremental flow, I hit the AM dial. 
1070 was in the midst of its broadcast about an unknown woman who had fallen to 
her death at the Barham overpass, barely a half-mile ahead. An apparent 
suicide. her body was still on the freeway, an investigation under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, no wonder! 
</P>
<P>
 Creeping toward Barham, I inched toward the right to see what I could see. 
Several emergency vehicles and cars, most likely those of witnesses, were 
parked on the shoulder. A small crowd stared down at your body from the 
overpass. A man in a sky-blue shirt held a camera at his neck. There you lay, 
under the yellow tarp, guarded by police and highway patrolmen, the area marked 
off with yellow tape. In spots, there were mounds of flesh, some flattened in a 
trail of skid marks. A few yards away lay a single brown loafer, as if you'd 
been knocked right out of your shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no clues to your race, size or hair color. But that well-worn shoe 
punctuates my scenario for you -- the one about a woman's failed struggle in a 
metropolis gone mad, where the only politics is survival and success is 
measured in multiples of zero. She finds facing yet another sunshiny day 
intolerable, knowing she hasn't got the quarter it takes to call for help. I 
feel what I imagine to be her pain. Then I imagine the pain of flight that must 
be gnawing through the guts of those who hit and ran. Would I have stopped? I 
don't know. Life on fast-forward has negative side effects -- a certain 
hardening that starts in the wallet and works its way to the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 As I exit the Ventura Freeway at Reseda, I hit the FM button. A blast from 
106.7 clears my neurons. And suddenly, I'm struck ironic by the hard-driving 
rhythmic lyric of Ziggy (David Bowie) Stardust and the Spiders from Mars 
cranking "Suffragette City": 
</P>
<P>
 " There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes . . . ahh, 
wham, bam, thank you, ma'am. . . . "

OUT OF HER REALM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last night I watched "Seasons of the Heart" (NBC, May 22) with Carol Burnett 
because of who she is and because of the hype it received the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 I was so disappointed. I think Burnett should stick to comedy, and that more 
care should be taken when doing a production such as this; the dialogue was so 
slow and the performances very amateurish.

IN BRIEF: NONFICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 RESISTANCE: The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising by Israel Gutman. (Houghton Mifflin: 
$24.95; 271 pp.) In the spring of 1943, Nazi troops were ordered to evacuate 
all Jews from the Warsaw ghetto where they had been forced to live, and put 
them on cattle cars headed for the death camps.A few hundred Jews, practically 
unarmed and hopelessly outnumbered, fought back. "Resistance," by Israel 
Gutman, is the dramatic story of the Warsaw ghetto from its creation to its 
awful, bloody end. 
</P>
<P>
 This is difficult, emotional material, and my experience of it changed while I 
was reading the book. Until the uprising begins, well over halfway through the 
book, one may feel hopelessly depressed and even sick. Nearly 500,000 people 
were packed into a few square blocks where they were starved, beaten and worked 
to within an inch of their lives. Diseases broke out, babies died in the street 
(the suffering of children is the hardest part to read) yet no one fought back 
until it was obvious the Nazis intended to kill them all. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, "Resistance" becomes oddly exhilarating. "The entire ghetto was 
ablaze. Thousands of people near physical and mental collapse -- virtually on 
the verge of madness -- not only maintained this way of life, but viewed its 
disappearance as a great catastrophe. . . . Nazis called (for the Jews) to 
surrender, and the inhabitants responded with bullets." There is enormous power 
in choosing your own death, and the hundreds of Jews who resisted, many of them 
teen-agers, grabbed that choice with a courage that shows the very best of what 
the human spirit has to offer.

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; 'STORYTIME' BROADENS ITS AUDIENCE 
OF LISTENERS HAVING FUN WITH BOOKS

 Storytime, a KCET children's staple for two years, has not only caught the 
attention of celebrity storytellers in Hollywood but also PBS station 
programmers across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Monday, the award-winning series produced by KCET will be carried by 
PBS affiliates nationwide. The show's goal is to show how much fun reading can 
be, using new books and classic stories read aloud by celebrities. Many read to 
their own children, as well as to members of the kid audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's great is that everyone is passionate about one story that's their 
favorite," notes producer Steve Kulczycki. He hopes that the show can encourage 
youngsters to find a favorite of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the show depends on the imagination of the kids," he says. "Maybe 
parents will do some reading with their own kids, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrity readers include Tom Selleck, Mariel Hemingway, John Goodman, Shari 
Belafonte, A Martinez, Paul Rodriguez, Edward James Olmos, Fred Savage, Cloris 
Leachman, Valerie Bertinelli, Paula Poundstone, John Ritter, Patricia 
Richardson, Cindy Williams, Amanda Plummer, Mayim Bialik, Meshach Taylor, 
Reginald Veljohnson, Maria Conchita Alonso and Hector Elizondo. 
</P>
<P>
 Puppet Kino and host Mara (Marabina Jaimes) are joined by a new co-host named 
Lucy (Anne Betancourt). Lucy adds a grandmother-like appeal, Kulczycki points 
out. Twenty new shows have been added to the original 20, which will be 
presented in rotation nationally. The 67 new readings bring the total of books 
read on the show to 137. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 20, Charles Dutton of "Roc" hosts a prime-time "Storytime" special at 
8 p.m. Dutton reads "Muckey Moose," and Jamie Lee Curtis reads her own book, 
"When I Was Little." The special will feature excerpts from the new shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Storytime" airs daily at 9:30-10 a.m. on KCET; weekdays at 10-10:30 a.m. on 
KPBS and 2:30-3 p.m. on KVCR. The special airs June 20 at 8 p.m. on KCET and 
KVCR. It airs June 21 at 10 a.m. on KPBS. For ages 2 and up. Another Family 
Show 
</P>
<P>
 One glimpse at the new Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle and you know that it's a product of 
Shelley Duvall ("Faerie Tale Theater," "Bedtime Stories," "Tall Tales and 
Legends"). Based on the popular children's stories by Betty MacDonald, "Mrs. 
Piggle-Wiggle" is filled with colorful, exaggerated sets with costumes and 
characters to match. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Stapleton stars as the eponymous lead character, a wise and loving lady 
who lives in an upside-down house and offers uncommon cures for such common 
childhood problems as "The Not Truthful Cure," "The Never Want to Go to 
Bedder's Cure," "The Fraidy Cat Cure" and "The Tattletale Cure." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle," the fifth original series Duvall has done for Showtime, 
offers "a wonderful, uninhibited creature, fearless and able to relate to 
children in a perfectly comfortable, unconditional way," Stapleton says. Most 
of all, the actress notes, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle is child- like, but not childish. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a great sense of humor, with a lot of common sense," Duvall adds. Not 
only was she drawn to the series of books because they were hilarious but also 
because they offer great information for families. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle gets her message across without using the wagging finger. 
"She never says, ' do this or do that,' " Duvall says. Through suggestion, the 
errant children always "end up understanding the right way on their own." 
</P>
<P>
 As Stapleton puts it, "She helps them see the light." 
</P>
<P>
 The hourlong "Special Parents' Sneak Peek" of "Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle" airs 
Tuesday at 9:35 p.m. Beginning June 14, the show begins its regular time slot, 
7:30-8 p.m. on Showtime. For ages 2 and up.

MR. X, WITH A KNIFE, IN THE BARROOM; THE RECKONING: THE MURDER OF CHRISTOPHER 
MARLOWE, BY CHARLES NICHOLL (HARCOURT BRACE JOVANOVICH: $24.95; 432 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Christopher Hitchens, Christopher Hitchens is critic-at-large for Vanity 
Fair. His most recent book is a collection of essays, For the Sake of Argument. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The title of this enthralling book already contains a sort of triple-entendre. 
The reckoning -- which has the same etymological origin as the score -- is the 
series of scratch-marks by which English landlords kept an account of their 
customers' eating and drinking. It has thus, with its verb accompaniment to 
settle, become an ideal metaphor in matters of crime and vengeance. It can also 
mean a final summing-up, as by a historian or investigator. And young "Kit" 
Marlowe, as everybody knows or thinks they know, was killed in a tavern brawl 
about the time the bill was being presented. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Nicholl's entire narrative has the faculty of being able to operate at 
several different levels. He makes use of the novelistic gifts he displayed in 
"The Fruit Palace," as well as the penchant for conspiracy he displayed in that 
same book. 
</P>
<P>
 To this he has added a feeling for history, especially of the High Elizabethan 
period in which England was riven by factions, both religious and political, 
and when the rudiments of a modern secret police battled the rudiments of an 
authentic foreign-backed subversion. Finally, his literary sensibility and his 
awareness of the theatrical tradition help keep the pages turning. 
</P>
<P>
 First ask yourself what you can truly say you know about Christopher Marlowe. 
That he was a playwright to rank with Shakespeare (there is even a sub-group of 
the Bacon and Oxford authorship schools that credits him with some of Will's 
imperishable canon). That he was gay and a smoker of Sir Walter Raleigh's 
wondrous import from Virginia ("All they who love not tobacco and boys are 
fools"). That he is remembered for some lines in common use ("Was this the face 
that launched a thousand ships?" and, I would add to Nicholl's index, the 
equally telling question: "Is it not passing great to be a king, and ride in 
triumph through Persepolis?"). What else? Practically nothing, I would guess, 
except the intelligence that he was stabbed in an alehouse. And "intelligence," 
for this fact, might be the apt description. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlowe, as Nicholl shows from the scrupulous reconstruction of old records 
and documents, was an amateur and very rash participant in the milieu of 
Elizabethan espionage. The wilderness of mirrors and the looking-glass world 
had nothing on this hectic, vicious and treacherous period. The only thing it 
has in common with the Cold War spy-thriller is the fact (of which Nicholl 
might have made a bit more) that the protagonist is gay and was educated at 
Cambridge University. 
</P>
<P>
 The great spymaster of the day was Sir Francis Walsingham, who with rack and 
rope and paid informer chased down the English Catholics suspected of aiding 
the vile designs of the King of Spain. (He was a favorite villain of Evelyn 
Waugh's and, interestingly, of Graham Greene's also.) Marlowe was from a 
Catholic background which is why, Nicholl believes, he was recruited as a 
"double" agent. But like many spies Marlowe may also have believed himself 
cleverer than his masters. He was quite happy to act as a hammer to the 
Catholics, not because he was a self-hater or a turncoat or a Protestant but 
because he was an atheist. The price to be paid for that version of dissent was 
higher, during an inter-Christian religious conflict, than any mere heresy. But 
perhaps Marlowe thought he was clever enough to get away with anything. 
</P>
<P>
 If he did, then he was wrong. The main area of overseas espionage work in that 
period was the Netherlands, or Low Countries, where Catholic-Protestant 
hostility was also at a horrific pitch and where both the Spanish and English 
crowns had proxies fighting for them. Following Nicholl's intricate but 
beautifully composed deductive writing, I think we can now suppose that Marlowe 
was sent to the Dutch town of Flushing on some obscure mission, that he got 
into trouble there, on a bizarre charge of forging money and that one of his 
cellmates, who was also a spy, later bore witness against him as a man who 
blasphemed against religion. Marlowe was thus living dangerously both as a 
sexual deviant and an offender against the faith, and though his cleverness and 
most probably his connections got him out of Flushing jail he may have begun to 
believe himself too lucky to be caught. We have met the type before in 
literature -- the roistering blade who laughs at his clumsy, plodding 
antagonists. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plodders have a dismal tendency to win in the end. And Marlowe was 
tempting fate by getting caught up in the great three-cornered palace intrigue 
between Sir Walter Raleigh, the Earl of Essex and the queen for whom they both 
vied in point of favor and patronage. Raleigh, too, was accused by his numerous 
and jealous enemies of sympathy for atheism. Nicholl speculates, very 
convincingly on the evidence, that Marlowe's more flamboyant heathenism and 
libertinism was employed as a means of discrediting Raleigh; of allowing the 
Essex faction to indict Raleigh by association. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus the denouement approaches, and I probably should not spoil it for you 
(this is, after all, a thriller) except to say that Marlowe was most probably 
not killed in the tavern, and that the provocation was not a fight over the 
score or reckoning, and that a cover-story was hastily put in place and has 
lasted ever since. The truth, as Josephine Tey famously said in her novelistic 
exculpation of the framed Richard III, is "a daughter of time." Enough time has 
elapsed, and sufficient new records have been opened or unearthed, for a long 
look at the Marlowe story, and for a well-grounded revisionism. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you have no desperate need to re-examine the truth of Marlowe's death 
in the light of a murder mystery, you will discover in these pages a truly 
Shakespearean cast of pickpockets, boasters, boozers, posturing aristos, false 
priests and phony judges, official torturers and charming rogues. And how 
contemporary they all seem. Had Marlowe lived he might have come down to us as 
a less fastidious Shelley, boldly scorning the false idols and superstitions of 
his day. From this attainment he has been shrouded, because of his murky life 
and sordid end. Nicholl's accomplishment is to have wiped away some of the 
smears and cobwebs, and restored a portrait that has been disfigured for too 
long.

the series went from airing once a week to five times a week. Michael Cascio, 
vice president of documentary programming, explains why he believes the series, 
hosted by Peter Graves and Jack Perkins, has become an audience favorite: 
"Where a big network might give you 10 minutes on a person, we will give you a 
whole hour," he says. "You get detail. That's one thing we can do that the 
other people can't. I think the reason why 'Biography' succeeds is that it 
lives on the name of the persons being profiled. If you do an Alfred Hitchcock 
or Margaret Thatcher or Hillary Clinton or John Belushi, these are people whom 
everybody knows who they are. They have an interesting life and can sustain 
detail that can last for an hour. Generally, you look for people who are 
popular and have a little bit of weight behind them." 
</P>
<P>
 The type and era of personalities the series chooses have evolved since the 
series premiered on April 6, 1987. Originally, most of the biographies were 
culled from the '60s Mike Wallace-hosted CBS series, also entitled "Biography." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, "Biography" profiles more than recent historical figures. "We have 
covered a lot of historical figures from the '30s and '40s -- Churchill and 
Roosevelt. We will still do some of those. But we have gone way forward. We 
have just done Sid Caesar and Milton Berle. We have done Madonna and Elizabeth 
Taylor." 
</P>
<P>
 Because production techniques have become so sophisticated, "Biography" also 
can examine the lives of such not-so-recent historical figures as Ulysses S. 
Grant, George Washington and Davy Crockett. "You can go back in time and use 
drawings and paintings," Cascio says. "We can have some fun. There are a lot of 
people that you can choose that are going to have audience appeal. The range is 
phenomenal. We have so much fun figuring out who we want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 "Biography" aspires to give viewers a fresh look at a particular person. "You 
have an obligation to the public," Cascio says. "We are not sensationalized. We 
are not tabloid. Our goal is fairness -- not to highlight the bad stuff or just 
dwell on the good parts. It's to present a balanced portrait of a person or a 
particular portrait. Generally speaking, the biography is meant to deal with 
people in all of their aspects and look at them as a whole, which is more 
difficult to do than you might think." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Hollywood community have become more receptive about 
participating in the series. "You can do anything, " Cascio says. "We can do a 
biography, but it's difficult to do -- not impossible -- without (the 
subject's) direct approval. Even if they don't talk, they can say to their 
friends, 'Don't talk to them.' When we told Sid Caesar we were doing this, he 
had a choice of cooperating or not, and he cooperated. He knows his life has 
had ups and downs. He said, 'It's better for me to cooperate and give you my 
side of the story rather than have a bunch of people telling stuff they don't 
know about.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Famous folks, Cascio says, also perceive the documentaries as a way to leave a 
legacy. 'I'm sure that for Milton Berle, aside from the fact he's a natural 
ham, this was a chance to get on record his life in an hour." 
</P>
<P>
 And what have been the highest-rated "Biography" subjects? 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Taylor, Milton Berle, Bruce Lee, Shirley Temple and Howard Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right below that there is a surprising middle pack including Napoleon and 
Vincent Price," Cascio says. 
</P>
<P>
 A&E plans to produce between 70 and 100 original biographies this year, 
including John Belushi, Sherlock Holmes ("We can do fictional people as well," 
Cascio says), Steve Allen, Davy Crockett, George Washington and Lucille Ball. 
</P>
<P>
 This week "Biography" profiles: Gen. Omar Bradley (Monday); Hillary Rodham 
Clinton (Tuesday); Stevie Wonder (Wednesday); Humphrey Bogart (Thursday); and 
Marilyn Monroe (Friday). 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Cascio says, he has a wish list, which includes Frank Sinatra, 
Michael Jackson, Barbra Streisand and Doris Day. "For me as producer and the 
head of documentaries here, it's sort of like being a kid in the candy store." 
</P>
<P>
 "Biography" airs weeknights at 5 and 9 p.m. on A&E. Several "Biography" 
documentaries are also available on A&E Home Video.

 Olde England met cyberpunk recently when a group of computer jocks staged a 
postmodern version of "Macbeth" on PCs worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Titled "PCbeth," the live production premiered April 23 -- Shakespeare's 430th 
birthday. It featured a cast of 17 players from as far away as South Africa and 
Israel who typed in their lines on the Internet Relay Chat channel, which 
allows users to "converse" in real-time. Reduced to approximately 150 lines of 
dialogue, the play was more Billy Idol than Billy Shakespeare. A sample 
exchange: Lady Macbeth (Lady M): "Did you do it? Idiot! You were supposed to 
leave the daggers on the guards. Give them to me, and for God's sake go clean 
up." Macbeth (PCbeth): "I'll never get to sleep after this. Where's the 
Prozac?" 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego producer Stuart Harris, an actor and computer expert, thinks PC 
Shakespeare is a good way to introduce computer nerds to the craft of drama. 
"The medium has limitless potential, but it's being underused," says Harris. 
"We'd like to commission original scripts written especially for this medium." 
</P>
<P>
 The audience was small, less than 100 people, but the reviews were 
encouraging. "It was very funny," says Gauri Desai, a Massachusetts psychiatric 
nursing student. "It was an innovative way of using the IRC. While they did 
have some problems due to lag and stuff, I thought the script was hysterical. 
Quite bril." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris introduced the idea of cyber-Shakespeare in December with "Hamnet," an 
80-line version of "Hamlet." But that production was interrupted by a 
thunderstorm that cut the producers' on-line access. "Hamnet" was repeated in 
February with Ian Taylor of the Royal Shakespeare Company in the title role. 
The next production, scheduled for this fall, is a new take on an old American 
classic. Quips Harris, "We're calling it 'An IRC Channel Named Desire.' We 
think Tennessee Williams is perfect for this."

 Well, we've always relied on the kindness of programmers. Jamie Reno

 ZEN SPEAKS: Shouts of Nothingness by Tsai Chih Chung, translated from the 
Chinese by Brian Bruya (Anchor: $10.95; 159 pp., illustrated, paperback 
original). Taiwanese cartoonist Tsai Chih Chung continues his exploration of 
Asian philosophy in this sly introduction to Zen Buddhism. The simple line 
drawings of a chubby, bulbous-nosed monk (reminiscent of the figures in old 
comic scrolls) offer parables and puzzles that emphasize some of the key 
tenants of Zen belief: The folly of seeking Enlightenment outside oneself, the 
error of confusing words with meanings, etc. More than 18 million of Tsai's 
books have been sold in 12 languages: "Zen Speaks" is the second to appear in 
English.

 I HAD A FATHER: A Post-Modern Autobiography by Clark Blaise (Addison-Wesley: 
$12.; 204 pp.) . As a child, Wesley had to endure his father's womanizing, 
shady dealings and pathological lies. He attempts to come to grips with his 
pain in these fragmented recollections of a search for identity that lead to an 
ancestral home in rural Quebec and provided insights into his own interracial 
marriage. Unfortunately, the author's moments of genuine insight get buried in 
rambling attempts to mythologize his condition.

 SEASONS OF THE COYOTE edited by Philip L. Harrison (Tehabi/HarperCollins West: 
$ ?? ; 114 pp., paperback original). Intelligent, adaptable and persistent, the 
coyote inhabits virtually every corner of North America, despite ill-advised 
campaigns to exterminate it. The brief essays in this attractive volume extol 
the cleverness and scroungy beauty of the coyote and recap the important place 
it occupies in Amerindian mythologies. The color pictures are striking and 
exceptionally crisp, but the decision to print the text on shaded paper makes 
the book hard to read.

 PETERSON FIRST GUIDE TO URBAN WILDLIFE written and illustrated by Sarah B. 
Landry (Houghton Mifflin: $4.95; 128 pp., paperback original). Landry takes an 
unusual approach in the latest entry in this popular series, introducing the 
various types of life on earth (animals, plants, viruses, bacteria, fungi, 
protoctists). Building from this basic information, she introduces some of the 
creatures that have adapted to life in American cities, both the familiar 
(rabbits, skunks, frogs, ants) and the lesser-known (minks, Luna moths, biting 
mites).

PALM LATITUDES: CLOSE-UP; THIS OLD FILM

 While other kids were trading baseball cards, Robert Gitt spent his time 
screening movies for his friends. When he wasn't happy with the quality of the 
film, he'd get two copies and splice together the best parts."An early film 
perfectionist," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Now years later, the obsession continues. As preservation officer for UCLA's 
Film and Television Archive and one of the world's premier film restorers, Gitt 
spends much of his time at the old, cavernous Technicolor Building in Hollywood 
putting his tireless techno-magic touch to mangled, faded and gnarled film. He 
has helped restore more than 500 films in the past decade, and has spent years 
lecturing on his craft in Berlin, Paris, London, Helsinki, "anywhere that loves 
film, which is just about everywhere," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Film preservation, which still must be learned on the job and apprentice style 
(there is no formal educational program in the United States), sounds achingly 
tedious -- viewing the snips of the same film thousands of times over several 
years until a complete movie can be assembled from various versions. But Gitt 
sees it as re-creating archeological gold -- and at $50,000 per color film and 
$15,000 per black-and-white, it might just qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his job at UCLA, Gitt worked as a technical officer for the American 
Film Institute in Washington, helping restore films such as Frank Capra's "Lost 
Horizon." One of his early restorations for UCLA was the 1922 "Toll of the 
Sea," one of Hollywood's first feature color films. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, one must wonder whether he gets tired of watching the same piece of 
film over and over and over. "I never get tired of looking at a piece of real 
art," he says. "Who would?" Janet Kinosian

 BLOOD WHISPERS VOLUME 2: L. A. Writers on AIDS edited by Terry Wolverton 
(Silverton Books/The Center/1625 N. Hudson Ave./Hollywood, CA 90028: $9.95; 144 
pp., paperback original). The stories, sketches and poems in the second 
anthology from the Los Angeles Gay And Lesbian Community Center's Perspectives 
Writing Program distill some of the unnumbered tears shed in the pandemic. 
Although the quality of the writing varies considerably, some of the pieces are 
genuinely moving. In David Varnon's "Jesse James Meets the AIDS Virus," a man 
tells stories to his lover's niece in an attempt to explain the death of 
someone they both loved; James Carroll Pickett recounts the efforts of a dying 
man to reconnect with his family in the elegiac "Plainsong."

 A BIG STORM KNOCKED IT OVER by Laurie Colwin (HarperPerennial: $12.; 259 pp.) 
. The last novel by a talented writer who died prematurely in 1992, "Storm" 
focuses on a young woman in New York City who observes the messy state of the 
families she knows and despairs of making her own marriage work. Jane Louise 
Parker loves her husband and enjoys her work as a graphic designer, but she's 
haunted by the fear that her happiness will crumble, despite her efforts to 
preserve it. The honest vulnerability of the characters sets Colwin's novel 
apart from the vapid tales of Manhattan neurotics who decry their angst in 
trendy clubs and chic boutiques.

 SWEET & SOUR by Andrew A. Rooney (Berkeley: $5.99; 305 pp.). There's something 
patently false about an Emmy-winning television commentator posing as a Regular 
Guy who loses odd socks in the dryer and balks at paying $27 for a tie.Despite 
his ingenuous stance, Rooney is not a dispenser of folk wisdom, but of folksy 
wisdom, the sort of down-home corn American audiences savor: The fruit in 
stores isn't as good as it used to be; self-service hasn't made gas cheaper and 
-- significantly, in light of past controversies -- "I'm tired of fighting my 
prejudices. I'm going to relax and enjoy them."

 THE BALKAN EXPRESS: Fragments From the Other Side of War by Slavenka Drakulic 
(HarperPerennial: $11.; 165 pp.). A journalist of Croatian descent who lives in 
Zagreb, Drakulic recounts the experiences of individuals who have endured -- 
and those who have perpetrated -- the horrors racking former Yugoslavia.A young 
soldier recalls shooting someone for the first time; a student plots the 
disenfranchisement of a benefactor; an old friend becomes a refugee. Drakulic 
decries the perverse mentality that strips friends, lovers and neighbors of 
their individuality and reduces them to anonymous ethnic statistics: "The 
irrational that dwells in each of us is being unleashed from its chain and 
nobody can control it anymore . . . because the demons in us have already made 
people perceive themselves as nothing but parts of the national being. . . . If 
there is any future at all, I am afraid of the time to come."

ON VIEW; LIFETIME'S 'HOME' SPIN

<P>
 Don't compare Marc Summers, the host of Lifetime's new show "Our Home," to Tim 
Allen's tool-happy character on "Home Improvement." And he's no renovation 
maven like TV's popular Bob Vila, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Far from it," says Summers, who nevertheless will be the latest TV host to 
help viewers make home sweet home a little sweeter. This by way of his new 
hourlong daytime show, bowing Monday, devoted to the humble abode. "I'm scared 
to even hang a picture in my house for fear of doing it wrong, having a hole in 
the wall, having to plaster and paint." 
</P>
<P>
 But his lack of expertise, he says, will be a strength as he leads the 
audience through the joys of making the most of their living quarters. "I think 
I'm sort of the anybody who's watching at home who for years has seen other 
people do this stuff. . . I can be a bridge to help them build their 
confidence. They don't realize that they can do these things." 
</P>
<P>
 You-can-do-it is the "Our Home" theme song. "The bottom line for the show is 
how to, how to, how to everything," says the show's executive producer, Erika 
Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
 How to make a tiny bathroom look bigger. How to do faux finishes. How to do 
window treatments on the cheap. How to make stained glass. How to make your own 
slipcovers. "Slipcovers are really hot right now. We have to be looking at 
what's on the cutting edge," says Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
 The show also aims to help viewers keep an eye on their wallets. It plays 
right into the '90s-style stay-at-home-and-save-money trend. "The whole nesting 
thing, cocooning, those are real catch phrases, but the reality is, home life 
is where it's at," Bishop notes. 
</P>
<P>
 But how can "Our Home" be so confident about nesting on the daytime schedule 
when a similar show, ABC's long-running "Home," recently lost its lease? The 
now-defunct "Home" also was packed with an eclectic mix of how-tos. In fact, 
Summers himself is a five-year veteran of the show. On "Home," he covered 
family-related issues and occasionally subbed for co-host Gary Collins. Carol 
Duvall, "Home's" crafts expert, is making the move to "Our Home" along with 
Summers. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarities aside, Peggy Allen, the Lifetime vice president overseeing the 
show, says that "Our Home" will be more contemporary than its predecessor. 
"We're going to take our cues more from the women's service magazines. There's 
an assumption that the woman is intelligent and that she wants to be as proud 
of her home and her wardrobe and her cooking as she would anything else in her 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole concept that whatever women are doing at home during the day must 
mean they're idiots, is wrong," says Allen, insisting that her program will 
show more respect for its viewers (who are expected to be mostly women). Her 
catch phrase for the show: "intelligent fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop agrees that "Our Home" will have a fresher attitude in an attempt to 
appeal to young women. "You don't have to be later in your years to enjoy doing 
things in the home." She's aiming at the VH-1 crowd. "They're in the late 20s 
and early 30s, they've made some money, and they're home having babies." 
</P>
<P>
 To get the video generation to take notice, the homey feeling of the show will 
be revved up. "The energy level will be higher. It'll move faster," Bishop 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The set, reminiscent of a photo spread in Victorian magazine, also will be a 
draw for style groupies. Bishop describes the look: an old home with 
wainscoting, leaded glass Queen Anne windows, a fireplace, reading nooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Another element that differentiates the show: "This isn't couch chat. No one's 
going to sit and talk about an issue. You've got tips in every segment," Bishop 
says. Tips not only about decorating, but on other ways to enhance home life, 
including cooking and gardening. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect to learn 10 things to do with an old milk carton, though. "This 
is not decorating with leftover coffee cans and making jewelry out of dried 
cheese," says Allen. The crafts will be more upscale: How about 10 things to do 
with roses? Make a rose necklace in the Cuisinart, a rose candle and rose jelly 
with Summers and craftswoman Duvall. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Bishop says that her host "is the biggest thing that makes the show 
stand out." 
</P>
<P>
 Summers, with his background in comedy and his experience as host of 
Nickelodeon's kids' shows "Super Sloppy Double Dare" and "What Would You Do?," 
says he'll bring a looseness and humor to his hosting duties. An example: In a 
recently taped segment on the merits of homemade baby food, he chose the 
store-bought stuff every time in a blindfolded taste test. "It got to be very 
funny," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop points out that "Our Home" will fill a void in TV programming. She also 
hopes to attract some of the 2 million to 3 million viewers a day left homeless 
when ABC's "Home" show went off the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to know this information," she says. She knows that firsthand, 
having just renovated her home in suburban New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny. I'm a career woman and always have been, but my home life is 
extremely important. I think I'm the perfect Lifetime viewer." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our Home" airs weekdays at 10 a.m. and repeats at 2 p.m. on Lifetime.

STYLE: GARDENS; HERE TO STAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Los Angeles is a restless city, where the evidence of history is forever being 
scrapped and rebuilt. But there's a longing for roots here, too, which tends to 
show up, rather fittingly, in our gardens. Despite being ethereal, gardens can 
suggest a certain vine-clad permanence. They may evoke the mood of an old house 
or create a past for a new one. In the garden-maker's hands, walls, paths, 
pools and things that grow can make us feel, despite having just arrived here, 
that we are home. Aging Grace 
</P>
<P>
 Like an ancient count in frayed evening clothes, the house of Naomi Foner and 
Stephen Gyllenhaal exudes a falling-down splendor -- from its viney eaves to 
its rangy flower beds. While the building, born in Hancock Park in 1918, looks 
as old as it is, the garden is new, designed by Los Angeles landscape architect 
Mia Lehrer of Lehrer Architects and B.L.S. Environmental Design. "We wanted 
everything to look faded, worn, overgrown," says Gyllenhaal, a 
Pennsylvania-born film director disturbed by the rootlessness of Californians. 
Foner, a screenwriter and self-described "New Yorker who grew up looking at 
grass sprouting through a sidewalk," had long yearned to live outdoors and to 
pick lemons off her own trees while the seasons changed, albeit subtly, around 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 The designers opened the house to the garden with French doors and a 
vine-wrapped porch. To complement the scale of the house, they planted huge 
deciduous trees -- a native sycamore, willows, liquidambars and corals -- in 
addition to a small fruit orchard. The texture and tone of other plantings 
softened the structure's hard, gray edges: silver santolina, rosemary, 
'Iceberg' roses and lacey Westringia rosmariniformis tangle together along a 
path to a secluded shade garden. Taking cues from the classically detailed 
architecture, the designers created a pool with rose-clad wall, trickling 
fountain and atmospheric water stains Gyllenhaal applied with brown dye. 
</P>
<P>
 "A wonderful house teaches you how to look at things," he says, "how to 
observe every detail." At the same time, Foner adds, "We're not so much careful 
people as exuberant. We cut the flowers, we eat the fruit, we really live 
here." Rooted in Tradition 
</P>
<P>
 When New York architect Michael McDonough designed a Westside residence, he 
used L.A.'s architectural past -- the designs of Greene and Greene, Richard 
Neutra and Irving Gill -- as inspiration. Likewise, Katherine Spitz (formerly 
of Burton & Spitz, now of Katherine Spitz Associates in Marina del Rey) created 
garden spaces reminiscent of Alta California and the Pasadena Arroyo. Carving 
landscapes from a small lot, she made a front courtyard with a Mission-style 
spareness. At its edges are tough inhabitants of desert and chaparral: 
Ceanothus and sage rise above silver-blue waves of Kleinia mandraliscae. Cacti, 
yuccas and agaves throw spiky forms against the simple plane of the house.  
</P>
<P>
 The back garden explodes with a lusty fullness meant to suggest a Craftsman 
heritage. A mountain of foliage -- more grasses, rockrose and helichrysum -- 
overflows a stone retaining wall into an outdoor dining room. Potted roses 
crowd against the house. A raised terrace is almost fully enclosed by living 
walls. Below, like a tiny green jewel, a child-sized pool sparkles beneath a 
shock of a white bougainvillea. These gardens, Spitz says, embody the Craftsman 
celebration of wild nature: "tumbling rocks, lush plants, the whole hillside 
spilling down." Plants With Patina 
</P>
<P>
 A rose that rambles gamely across a city lot for 85 years deserves to be 
rewarded. For an old Cherokee climber in Brentwood, the prize was a whole 
garden that landscape architect Pamela Burton (formerly of Burton & Spitz, now 
of Pamela Burton & Co. of Santa Monica) designed around it. Within the garden's 
straight stone walls, layered overgrowth speaks of history as eloquently as the 
rose does. At the center, on a pergola, reclines the Cherokee, its massive 
three-part trunk below, its crown of blooms visible everywhere in the 
Italian-style landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized as an agrarian retreat within the city -- a reverse image of the 
classic villa garden in the country -- this California version divides along 
the axis of the pergola into two main rooms. One is a kind of crazy orchard, 
its mix of fruit trees marooned in knee-high clover and nasturtiums. The other 
is a recessed lawn framed by Santa Rita stone steps and lavish flower borders. 
While changes in levels on the lawn side make the whole place seem larger, the 
orchard alludes to the owner's lifelong career in California agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, in their own discrete courtyards, are all the amenities of outdoor 
living: a dining terrace, a simple spa, an herb-filled kitchen garden. Unusual 
plants -- such as Chinese tallow trees ( Sapium sebiferum ) and macadamia nuts 
( Macadamai ternifolia ) -- enliven the rooms, and huge oil jars engulfed by 
Santa Barbara daisies ( Erigeron karvinskianus ) add to an overall mood of 
timelessness. Throughout the garden, too, are more roses. Splashy hybrid teas 
bedeck a border, a Belle of Portugal claims a portion of the pergola and a 
Cecile Brunner climbs a wall. All echo the spirit of the Cherokee, the gutsy 
briar that started the show.

AHI IN THE SKY; AT THE VENERABLE TOWER DOWNTOWN, THE FOOD IS FINALLY 
CHALLENGING THE VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In front of the Transamerica Center, a limousine idled. As we entered the 
foyer, the elevator doors opened, and two high-spirited teen-age couples, the 
boys decked out in formal white tails, the girls in slender evening dresses, 
stepped out. As they rushed into the night, the young men held the door open 
while the young women teetered through on mile-high heels, leaving the scent of 
gardenias behind. "Prom night," confirmed the guard on the 30th floor, smiling. 
"We've got a helipad on the roof, and they arrived by helicopter," he 
recounted, amused, as he ushered us into a second lift. Two more floors up to 
the Tower Restaurant and its drop-dead view of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of how many times I've learned my lesson -- that the quality of the 
cooking usually diminishes in inverse proportion to the quality of the panorama 
-- I still arrive hopeful. I know I probably shouldn't be. That's because few 
restaurants-with-a-view make even a creditable attempt to do anything 
interesting, assuming that the bankable scene from the top will bring a steady 
supply of tourists and die-hard romantics. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, that was the case with the Tower. But since Akira Hirose, 
formerly of the Peninsula Beverly Hills, took over as chef last August, the 
food is edging up on the view. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years ago, this was one of the city's top French restaurants, with a 
French chef, a French maitre d' and a cellar of fine French wines. In fact, 
when it first opened, you needed a membership card to get in. And after all 
these years, when almost every old-guard restaurant has gone casual or gone out 
of business, the Tower remains a restaurant for grown-ups. Or anyone who would 
like to feel grown-up for the night. The lighting is soft, all the better to 
show off the view; the atmosphere is hushed and serene. A pianist tinkles old 
standards in the background. The silver is heavy, and the waiter unfolds your 
napkin with a flourish. And the menu now offers enough pleasant surprises and a 
few really good dishes to make this Downtown landmark worth a visit.  
</P>
<P>
 Reserve a table at dusk, when you can savor the spectacle of night falling 
over this vast city. A river of light, the Santa Monica Freeway flows in wide 
curves toward the setting sun as downtown empties. On my first visit, I was so 
engrossed in the fat wine list with its roster of older French vintage, I 
almost missed the sunset reflected in shoulder-to-shoulder skyscrapers. 
</P>
<P>
 To move some of the wine inventory, valued at $100,000, the restaurant has 
recently lowered the prices on many of its top imported wines, particularly 
Burgundies. (The '70s is as far back as the Burgundy list goes.) It takes more 
than a casual look, however, to ferret out the real finds, like one of the last 
bottles of '81 Vosne-Romanee from Henri Jayer, $40, which shows what a great 
winemaker can do with a mediocre vintage, or the '78 Cos d'Estournel Bordeaux, 
priced fairly at $50. A good buy, too, is the '90 Riesling Halbtrocken 
Kabinett, $20. It's definitely an old-fashioned list, with little space devoted 
to wines of the Rhone, Italy or Germany. Even California wine estates are 
outnumbered by the French. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu, for the most part, doesn't disappoint. One night steamed live 
scallops were listed as a special, eight tender little pillows presented in 
their shells with curry-stained slivers of braised fennel. I was just as 
impressed with Hirose's beautiful carpaccio: thinly sliced raw beef filet 
scattered with artichoke hearts and chips of Parmesan with a sharp wasabi 
horseradish sauce zigzagged over. And he has a way with shiitake mushrooms. 
Deep flavored and cooked to a creamy consistency, they're set on a cushion of 
garlic mashed potatoes and topped with a puff pastry lid. 
</P>
<P>
 But the best of this delicious lot had to be the seared sea scallops, also in 
puff pastry, almost caramelized on the outside and custardy within, their sweet 
richness balanced by the spinach beneath and a bracing lime sauce. I could 
happily make a meal of  
</P>
<P>
 these appetizers. I was less enthusiastic about a thick cucumber gazpacho with 
a hefty dose of cream that nearly obliterated the cucumber, or the salad of 
crisp endive and romaine showered with bits of black truffle, the leaves coated 
with an overpoweringly perfumed truffle oil. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing I learned in three meals at the Tower: You can trust this chef with 
seafood. Does a Los Angeles restaurant with any pretensions exist that doesn't 
list ahi tuna on the menu? Yet this recurring Tower special, a thick slab 
cooked rare at the center, blows away any boredom with its quality and its 
impeccable presentation. Grilled Atlantic salmon and the marinated swordfish 
are fine, too. And for red wine fans, there are grilled lamb chops in a simple 
rosemary jus, a thick, grilled pork chop in prune sauce and, occasionally, a 
tasty veal chop. One night the list of specials included sauteed venison 
medallions, rare at the center and served in a sticky red currant sauce 
alongside a celery-root puree and spatzle, the squiggly German-style noodle. 
Rare steak topped with a smear of Roquefort is a good match with the '79 Gaja 
Barbaresco (a bargain at $30). All is well until the duck breast, which arrives 
looking like a forlorn stir-fry improbably garnished with pieces of tart lemon 
flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes time for sweets, the waiters roll up with an elaborate 
three-tiered cart on which the desserts are displayed. One by one, the waiters 
describe each and joke that all are plastic, in reference to Japanese 
restaurants' penchant for exquisitely realistic plastic food displays. We stare 
hard, trying to decide if they're teasing or not. (They are.) But like most 
Japanese Western-style pastries, these are all form and very, very sweet. Every 
one of them is forgettable save for a special one night of ice cream drenched 
in raspberry liqueur and topped with shavings of white chocolate; at $12, 
though, it was twice the price of the others. The best plan would seem to be to 
skip dessert and pass to espresso in the bar. That is, until you taste the 
watery espresso. Well, there's always the view -- which never disappoints.

ON THE RECORD: 'BORIS GODUNOV' GETS THE BERLIN TREATMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The eagerly awaited "authentic version" from Berlin of Mussorgsky's own "Boris 
Godunov," as distinct from Rimsky-Korsakov's gentrification of the composer's 
rough-hewn original, is here. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony's recording (58977, 3 CDs) preceded concert performances last fall that 
reportedly restored the beleaguered Claudio Abbado to supreme power over the 
supposedly faltering Berlin Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 German critics hailed the event as the greatest thing to have happened to 
music in Berlin since, well, since the late Herbert von Karajan. And, as this 
recording evidences, the orchestra is sounding rather the way it sounded under 
Karajan, while Abbado's overall interpretation bears more resemblances to 
Karajan's (recorded with the Vienna Philharmonic, not the Berlin) than might be 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the musical text, let's (over)simplify the matter by saying that 
this is a collation of three "original" editions, and that Rimsky's editorial 
presence is absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Authentic or otherwise, what emerges from these superbly recorded CDs is 
well-ordered and stunningly well-played. Yet it is, in sum, a good deal less of 
an event than what we were led to expect by the ecstatic post-performance word 
from Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 First, that glorious orchestra is overly prominent, even in the choruses. How 
much of this is attributable to the conductor is difficult to tell. 
Furthermore, the excellent choral ensemble, provided by the Slovak Philharmonic 
and Berlin Radio, sounds too polished for what is intended to represent, 
variously, "the Russian people" and the rabble. 
</P>
<P>
 The governing intelligence here is Abbado's. He brings to the project an 
admirable ability to organize large forces and a complex musical structure. And 
we hear too much of both: organization and structure, the mechanics of the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What emerges is a "Boris" that, while favoring the letter of Mussorgsky's 
rough score over Rimsky's relatively smooth one, finds the conductor and his 
colleagues rounding off many of Mussorgsky edges and angles, thereby evoking 
the Rimsky spirit. The performance is at times curiously slack as well, 
starting with the crunchy choruses of the prologue, which are subjected to 
fussy dynamics, and when the volume level is markedly reduced, the tempo can 
slow alarmingly. 
</P>
<P>
 The entries of the first solo singers, the Police Officer and Shchelkalov, 
sung by Albert Shagidullin and Mikhail Krutikov, both excellent, fail to make 
their usual impact for being so unincisively -- although tempos are fast -- 
accompanied. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbado's singers, like their conductor, do a lot of reflecting. While it's 
nice to be shown by Anatoly Kotcherga, the possessor of a seemingly huge and 
clearly pliant instrument, what a caring family man Boris Godunov is, it's not 
what the opera or the character are really about. People don't pay big bucks to 
hear Daddy Boris sing lullabies. 
</P>
<P>
 There are livelier performances from tenor Sergei Larin, whose well-sung 
Grigory projects the right edge of fanaticism. With Larin, the ubiquitous 
Samuel Ramey as Pimen, and here Abbado's mobile pacing and firm shaping, the 
opening scene of Act I becomes more than usually engrossing. 
</P>
<P>
 Another plus is the subtly menacing Rangoni of Sergei Leiferkus, but Marjana 
Lipovsek's Marina is more tough than seductive, and Gleb Nikolsky lacks the 
rhythmic acuity to make the most of Varlaam's showstopping opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 The recently reissued (EMI 54377, 3 CDs) 1977 recording of the "original 
version" (in fact a different conflation from Sony's of non-Rimsky editions), 
decently played by the Polish Radio Orchestra/Katowice and in -- not 
inappropriately -- comparatively raw sonics, is to these ears a more potent 
dramatic and musical experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerzy Semkow is not the most inspiring of conductors, but he has a thrillingly 
uninhibited chorus, that of the Polish Radio in Krakow, and a cast of vocal 
paragons, led by the late Martti Talvela as a dignified yet sufficiently edgy 
Boris, Leonard Mroz's deep, dark Pimen, Nicolai Gedda's visionary Grigory, the 
lusty Varlaam of Aage Haugland and the smoldering Marina of Bozena Kinasz. 
</P>
<P>
 EMI's "Boris Godunov" may not be the last word on the subject either, but it 
remains a good show, devoid of slickness, and a feast of first-rate singing.*

 *** 1/2 Mulgrew Miller, "With Our Own Eyes," Novus. Miller's last release, 
with quartet, quintet and septet sessions, obscured his genius.Here, with 
backing from bassist Richie Goods and drummer Tony Reedus, we hear Miller's 
deep pianistic voice clearly, with spare accouterment, in a program of 
originals plus the workhorse "Body and Soul." Rich in harmonics and smart 
narrative, Miller renders McCoy Tyner-inspired modalisms ("Somewhere Else"), 
playgrounds of swing ("Small Portion"), bluesy Monkisms ("When I Get There") 
and sensitive ballad crooning worthy of Bill Evans ("Summer Me, Winter Me") in 
a strong, individual fashion. "Eyes" sees Miller -- who performs Tuesday 
through next Sunday at Catalina Bar & Grill -- at the top of his craft. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four stars (excellent).

 *** Tommy Flanagan, "Lady Be Good . . . for Ella," Verve. The pianist, 
elegance personified, dedicates this 10-tune program to First Lady of Jazz Song 
Fitzgerald -- for whom he served as accompanist, primarily from 1968 to 
1978.There are no bumps on these performances, no bruises, just easygoing and 
lovely lines dropped in one after the other, the pianist supported craftily by 
bassist Peter Washington and drummer Lewis Nash. The title track is played 
oh-so-slowly in one version, then much faster in another; "Smooth Sailing" is a 
neat and tidy blues, while "Rough Ridin' " is a crackling romp through "I Got 
Rhythm" changes. Other nutritious tracks: "Love You Madly," "How High the 
Moon," "Pete Kelly's Blues."

NEW RELEASES; LENA HORNE RETURNS WITH LOVESOME SOUNDS; *** 1/2; LENA HORNE, 
"WE'LL BE TOGETHER AGAIN" ( BLUE NOTE )

 Horne again, born again -- as a result of her triumphant concert last year 
celebrating Billy Strayhorn, which triggered this belated return to records. 
There are five Strayhorn works here, two by Duke Ellington, and the rest by a 
judicious assortment of songsmiths. 
</P>
<P>
 Her sound has changed little over the decades; the diction and the vibrato are 
utterly her own. Her backers are mainly a jazz-oriented group, including 
Houston Person on tenor sax and Toots Thielemans on harmonica. Two of the 
Strayhorn tunes -- "Maybe" and "You're the One" -- were written for Horne; 
others include the long-familiar "Something to Live For" and "A Flower Is a 
Lovesome Thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of Johnny Mathis in a vocal duet adds nothing. Best cuts are the 
swingers ("Havin' Myself a Time," "Do Nothing Till You Hear From Me") and the 
ballads, even "My Buddy," complete with violin obbligato (a rare example of 
schmaltz with class). Horne, who will turn 77 on June 30, remains a wonderful 
preeminence after 60 years behind the mike.

NEW RELEASES; ****; MARIAN MCPARTLAND-CLARK TERRY, "PIANO JAZZ" ( JAZZ ALLIANCE 
)

<TEXT>
<P>
 The latest and certainly one of the best in the transcriptions of McPartland's 
"Piano Jazz" radio series, this entertaining hour finds trumpeter Terry in 
estimable form as soloist, vocalist and raconteur. Reminiscing about his days 
with Duke Ellington, his invention of the hilarious "Mumbles" vocal styles and 
his work in jazz education, he fields questions from his ever-charming 
interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry solos, often with a mute, on several originals, such as "Michelle" (no 
relation to the Beatles tune), "The Simple Waltz" and "The Snapper." 
McPartland, in addition to backing him, offers a piano solo, her own engaging 
"There'll Be Other Times." 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the hour are such standards as Eubie Blake's "Memories of You" 
and Ellington's "Come Sunday."(These award-winning programs deserve CD reissues 
in their entirety.)

 *** Collective Soul, "Hints, Allegations and Things Left Unsaid," Atlantic. 
Melding retro-leaning tunefulness with an alternative, Southern-fried edge, 
this Georgia quintet has forged an uplifting, infectious amalgamation.The hit 
single is "Shine," a warm, bluesy romp with an irresistible chorus. This 
diverse debut may be too predictable for musical pundits, but it's still an 
ardent effort.

POP MUSIC CHARTS: SELLING LIKE FRUITCAKES

 Parrothead power! That legion of hard-core Jimmy Buffett followers certainly 
made its presence felt on The Times' Southern California pop album chart, 
powering their leader's "Fruitcakes" to a lofty No. 5 debut. And this isn't 
just regional Parrothead power. The album also entered the national chart at 
No. 5. Ace of Base continues its remarkable run, with its pop-dance "The Sign" 
in the Top Five both in locally and nationally. On The Times' pop singles 
chart, Ace of Base has two Top 20 singles: "The Sign" (No. 19) and "Don't Turn

RECORD RACK: *** SEAL; "SEAL" ( SIRE/WARNER BROS. ) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The black Sting? A male Joni Mitchell? The new Terence Trent D'Arby? 
</P>
<P>
 After his impressive 1991 debut album, also titled "Seal," this prodigiously 
talented English singer-songwriter seemed quite capable of going in many 
different directions.The way he skillfully squeezed unsettling, poetic lyrics 
into a commercial pop framework on his big hit single "Crazy" clearly marked 
him for big things. 
</P>
<P>
 On his second album -- produced, as was the debut, by Trevor Horn -- that male 
Joni Mitchell tag seems to fit best (she even guests on the tranquil "If I 
Could"). Seal's softer side clearly dominates. Mostly in a mellow, reflective 
mood, he ponders philosophical and romantic themes, his gently gloomy voice 
adding urgency to such moody, melodic pieces as "Dreaming in Metaphors," 
"People Asking Why" and "Don't Cry." 
</P>
<P>
 The explosiveness that simmered under even the most serene tracks on the first 
album isn't there this time. That rookie's aggressiveness and experimentation 
that marked the first album seems to have been replaced by a desire to firmly 
entrench himself in the pop-folk genre. 
</P>
<P>
 While there's nothing as arresting as "Crazy" on this album, it's a quite 
satisfying sophomore effort.

 ** 1/2 Indigo Girls, "Swamp Ophelia," Epic. If only Emily Saliers and Amy Ray 
weren't so acutely aware that we're listening.The folk-rocking duo labors to 
imbue every lyric with heart- or mind-expanding meaning, sometimes sapping the 
music's bracing, insouciant spirit. They come through with a few songs that 
adroitly balance earnestness and gracefully emphatic playing, notably "Touch Me 
Fall" and "Dead Man's Hill."

 ** 1/2 South Central Cartel, " 'N Gatz We Truss," GWK/RAL/ Chaos.Cruising the 
'hood, dodging bullets, attacking enemies, chasing women, partying with homies 
. . . you've heard it all before. While the Cartel's second album doesn't 
advance the art of gangsta rap, the group does a fair job of re-creating the 
tensions of 'hood life. Touches of humor make this a little better than most.

 *** 1/2 Frank Black, "Teenager of the Year," Elektra. Remember Pong? William 
Mulholland? The Three Stooges? CB radios? Frank Black does, and he sets these 
and other preoccupations into the vigorously inventive swirl of 
punk-garage-psychedelic-progressive rock that launched his post-Pixies career 
so auspiciously last year.A pop-rock enthusiast and iconoclast of the first 
order, Black deserves the same salute that he offers L.A. water baron 
Mulholland: Ole ole.

ALBUM REVIEW; *** STONE TEMPLE PILOTS; "PURPLE" ( ATLANTIC ) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHERINE TURMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks to meaty, memorable and introspective songs, the Southern California 
band's cohesive sophomore outing should eradicate references to its "Seattle" 
sound."Purple" is dark but transcendent, as the band grapples musically and 
lyrically with issues surrounding sudden success. 
</P>
<P>
 While there's a pervasive melancholy, "Purple" is full of compelling and 
disquieting musical landscapes. In addition to such brawny songs as "Vaseline" 
and "Lounge Fly," the band shines on the beautiful, spare, Celtic-tinged 
"Pretty Penny." A "hidden" track -- a high-camp tune performed by a 
Washington-based lounge singer -- hints at the band's heretofore unseen humor. 
With "Purple," Stone Temple Pilots have come into their own -- painfully, 
perhaps, but with an undeniable sureness and power. KATHERINE TURMAN

POP EYE: MAYBE THEY MEANT ROCK'LL DIE THIS MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Does anybody -- other than critics and songwriters -- really listen to words? 
</P>
<P>
 Joe and John J. Kohut, a pair of East Coast pop fans and writers, apparently 
feel the answer is yes. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, they think rock fans are so interested in words about music that 
they've put together a book that brings together their favorite rock quotes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rock Talk" (Faber and Faber: $13.95, paperback) tells you what musicians, 
critics and others on the scene have to say about everything from songwriting 
to guitar smashing. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are Pop Eye's Top 10 from "Rock Talk": 
</P>
<P>
 10 -- "In rock 'n' roll, you're built up to be torn down. Like architecture in 
America, you build it up and let it stand for 10 years, then call it shabby and 
rip it down and put up something else." -- Joni Mitchell 
</P>
<P>
 9 -- "Rock can be seen as one last attempt to break out of this dead and 
soulless universe and reassert the universe of magic." 
</P>
<P>
 -- William S. Burroughs 
</P>
<P>
 8 -- "In the end, I realized that rock 'n' roll wasn't just about finding fame 
and wealth. Instead, for me, it was about finding your place in the world, 
figuring out where you belong." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bruce Springsteen 
</P>
<P>
 7 -- "Punk is musical freedom. It's saying, doing and playing what you want. 
In Webster's terms, Nirvana means freedom from pain, suffering and the external 
world, and that's pretty close to my definition of punk rock." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kurt Cobain 
</P>
<P>
 6 -- "Long, flat expanses of professionalism bother me. I'd rather have a band 
that could explode at any time. And I think that's what people like, too: soul 
and expression and real fire and emotion more than perfection." -- Neil Young 
</P>
<P>
 5 -- "I've been imitated so well I've heard people copy my mistakes." -- Jimi 
Hendrix 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- "One of the greatest contradictions of rock 'n' roll is that it's very 
personal, private music made on a huge public address system." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bono 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- "It's like a Bob Dylan song that you've loved for years and years, and 
then you read an interview and he says, 'Oh, it's about this dog that was run 
over in the street.' You're like, 'What! That song colored and altered my 
opinion of life for three years. What do you mean it's about a dead dog in the 
street!' " 
</P>
<P>
 -- R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- "I opened the door for a lot of people, and they just ran through and 
left me holding the knob." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bo Diddley 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- "It will be gone by June." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Variety in 1955, on rock 'n' roll 
</P>
<P>
 -- Robert Levine

 Elton John, just coming off his teaming with Tim Rice for the songs from 
Disney's animated film "The Lion King," has finished work on his own new album, 
due in the fall. All the songs were written by John with his No. 1 partner, 
Bernie Taupin. And it's official: the John-Billy Joel tour will not be coming 
to L.A., due to Joel's commitments to other ventures. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Neil Young and his Crazy Horse rhythm section of Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina 
were back together recently, recording a new album. Meanwhile, Talbot and 
Molina, along with new Crazy Horse member Mike Hamilton, have been recording in 
England, backing former Icicle Works leader Ian McNabb. There's also talk of a 
Crazy Horse album, featuring the band's full touring lineup, which also 
includes Sonny Mone and former Rain Parade frontman Matt Pucci. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In an odd coupling, suave Robert Palmer has recorded a version of Devo's "Girl 
U Want" for his upcoming album, "Honey," due in September. The album, recorded 
at London's Abbey Road over the course of the last three years, includes guitar 
work by Extreme's Nuno Bettencourt. Palmer is also reportedly back at work with 
Power Station, the band including former Duran Duran members John and Andy 
Taylor and former Chic drummer Tony Thompson. They've been recording in L.A. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Jim Carrey, pop star? That's apparently the idea as the rubber-faced actor is 
the featured performer on a version of the old Desi Arnaz novelty "Cuban Pete," 
as performed by Carrey in the upcoming film "The Mask." Robert Clivilles and 
David Cole of C+C Music Factory are remixing the single version. The soundtrack 
album, with a focus on new swing-style recordings, will also include "Hey 
Pachuko" by the Royal Crown Revue and "Gee Baby, Ain't I Good to You," 
performed by "Mask" co-star Cameron Diaz. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 More soundtrack news: In addition to producing the Billy Idol-Steve Stevens 
title song and the Plimsouls' reunion remake of "A Million Miles Away," Ralph 
Sall has added to the "Speed" soundtrack a new song by Ric Ocasek and tracks by 
Cracker, Blues Traveler, Rod Stewart and Gary Numan, all dealing with the title 
topic. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Richard Perry is recruiting star singers for a Sam Cooke tribute 
album, which will include remakes of such Cooke hits as "Havin' a Party" and 
"Bring It on Home to Me." . . . Garth Brooks' older sister (and his bass 
player) Betsy Smittle is putting the finishing touches on her own debut album, 
due in August. Just like her baby brother, she's singing pop-country material. 
As of now, though, Garth's not guesting on the album. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Virgin is set for two reissue projects in July: "T.V. Eye," Iggy Pop's 1978 
live album featuring such songs as "Lust for Life" and "I Wanna Be Your Dog," 
and "Poison Years," a compilation from Bob Mould's two Virgin albums plus five 
previously unreleased live recordings.*

 BEACH EROSION: The series of "two-fer" CDs offering a duet of Beach Boys 
albums -- plus bonus tracks -- on one CD was hailed as a great bargain when it 
was launched in 1990. Now it's being deleted in favor of CD reissues of the 
original Beach Boys catalogue, and Capitol Records is being jeered for the 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 The "two-fers" contained at least an hour of music and sold at the standard CD 
price of about $14 to $16. In the return to the original configuration, most of 
the albums are only about half an hour long, with a "mid-line" price of less 
than $10 in most stores.

 Capitol's official rationale for the change: "The individual albums have never 
been out on CD," says Philip Sandhaus, Capitol's vice president of catalogue 
development and strategic marketing. "Now the consumer will not be forced to 
buy two titles at once and can buy the one he or she wants at a lower price. 
And they'll be out for the historical value of the titles in their own right."  
</P>
<P>
 Pete Howard, editor of the monthly CD newsletter ICE, says that judging by the 
fans who have called him, there's more demand for the "two-fer" bargains than 
the "historical" reissues. "I don't think people had the attachment to the 
Beach Boys albums that way," he says. "The early albums, in particular, were 
just singles collections. After offering the 'two-fers,' this is a step 
backward." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandhaus says that the decision to delete the "two-fers" was boosted by the 
fact that the CDs have not been selling well in the last two years or so. If 
consumer demand dictates, he says, the format could be revived. He also notes 
that the return of the original configurations, currently slated for September, 
will precede more Beach Boys releases, including such "rarities" as a 
long-discussed CD of the legendary "Smile" sessions, some of which were 
included in last year's Beach Boys box set. Steve Hochman

 AND ONE MORE THING: The Fatburger fast-food chain claims that its first 
restaurant in Los Angeles was the place where Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra 
went to get burgers after recording sessions back in the '50s. Now, with 20 
stores and plans to expand, the chain is trying to re-tap into that legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Fatburger has set up a deal with Rhino Records to keep the old tunes coming 
from jukeboxes in each restaurant. Starting with the just-opened outlet on 
Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood, Rhino will stock the boxes with CD 
albums from its vast catalogue of reissues and oldies compilations, focusing on 
R&B and blues, and will line the walls with classic photos of many of the 
artists, provided by the Michael Ochs Archives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The soulful sounds of Aretha Franklin, Jackie Wilson, Tina Turner, Fats 
Domino . . . and the '90s attention to quality ingredients is what we're all 
about," says Fatburger vice president Bentley Hetrick in a press release, 
stretching the comparison as he stretches across decades. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that's completely '90s: the price for the music. It's one song for a 
quarter, which probably would have gotten you five plays in the '50s.*

 In this popular 1993 film, the killer whale becomes a symbol of nature 
exploited, the ultimate victim of man's greed and rapacity.Like Willy himself, 
trapped in a park, the theme is imprisoned in a movie fairy tale. But somehow 
the majesty comes through this slightly sentimental adventure story of Boy 
(Jason James Richter) meets Whale. Children's movies, after all, shouldn't be 
asked for the sophistication and verisimilitude we demand of adult films -- and 
"Free Willy" is for children and families, first and foremost (HBO Tuesday at 8 
p.m.; Friday at 6 a.m. and 4 p.m.). Michael Wilmington

 Documentary maker Ross McElwee's follow-up to his cult hit "Sherman's March," 
follows his life in the recent past.He attends a family reunion in Charlotte, 
N.C., is married and endures a series of unforeseen sorrows. What starts out as 
jaunty and dawdling becomes a kind of meditation on mortality. But McElwee 
(pictured, with friend Charleen Swansea) doesn't make you wince at his 
seriousness. His bafflement at what is going on in his life is a genuine, 
unadorned response to tragedy. You don't feel as if he's exploiting his ill 
fortune. This is a one-of-a-kind movie because McElwee himself seems one of a 
kind (KCET Tuesday at 10 p.m.). Peter Rainer

 Neil Simon's play has a melancholy undertow. Mercedes Ruehl (pictured) and 
Irene Worth, who each won Tonys for their performances on Broadway, bring out 
its full, racking sadness under Martha Coolidge's direction.Ruehl plays a 
womanly child whose will is stunted by Worth, her ogre of a mother. It's the 
summer of 1942, and Ruehl's recently widowed brother (Jack Laufer) deposits his 
two young sons (Brad Stoll, left, and Mike Damus) with his unaccommodating 
mother. The atmosphere inside their Yonkers apartment over their candy shop is 
thick with dreams: deferred, dashed and rejuvenated. The other major dreamer is 
Ruehl's other brother (Richard Dreyfuss), a petty hoodlum who hides out there 
for a time (Cinemax Friday at 8 p.m.). Peter Rainer

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; DIAGNOSIS: HERE'S A PART THAT CAME VERY NATURALLY TO 
ACTOR BARRY VAN DYKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last thing most kids want to do when they grow up is work 14-hour days 
with their dad. But Barry Van Dyke -- who co-stars in his father Dick Van 
Dyke's "Diagnosis Murder" -- doesn't mind at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd work with him any time," says Van Dyke, 42, from his Conejo Valley home. 
He adds that his dad, long labeled one of Hollywood's nicest actors, is "the 
best to work with, very creative. He has a lot of integrity and he'll work no 
matter what, including physical discomfort. He set a fine example. We've always 
talked about working together." 
</P>
<P>
 On the CBS comedy-drama, where father and son act as father and son, Van Dyke 
plays police investigator Steve Sloan, who often helps his physician and 
mystery-solver dad, Dr. Mark Sloan, get out of hot water. 
</P>
<P>
 Producers thought it would be easier if they made the local police 
investigator Sloan's son. "He doesn't really want to arrest his meddling dad," 
Van Dyke says, laughing. Of the Sloans' relationship, he adds, "It's an easy 
role for me to fall into. My dad pretty much plays himself. You're seeing the 
real him. All that warmth and humanity really comes across. So I tend to play 
myself. So their relationship is pretty much ours." 
</P>
<P>
 While Van Dyke's siblings -- one brother and two sisters -- all considered 
careers in show business, he was the only one who took it seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, well aware of the trappings of a fickle industry, advised his 
oldest son to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted me to have my childhood," says Van Dyke, who spent his youth in 
Mandeville Canyon and Encino. "He told me that if I still wanted to act after I 
graduated high school, then it would be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the family moved to Los Angeles when he was 9 for "The Dick Van 
Dyke Show," he never felt they were part of the show-business community. "My 
father didn't travel in those circles. We were aware he was on TV and watched 
the show and knew it was successful, but we didn't socialize with a lot of 
show-business types." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some of Van Dyke's best memories include visits to the set of his father's 
show. Watching Carl Reiner, Mary Tyler Moore and his father work together was 
"the greatest thing to see," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 When his father worked on location, it became the family vacation. Trips to 
England and Hawaii are remembered fondly. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledges that, initially, his father's name may have helped him get an 
agent, but it certainly didn't help him get work. "There's too much at stake 
for producers and casting directors to get you in on just a name," Van Dyke 
says. Eventually, it comes down to: "You either perform or you don't. You work 
or you don't." 
</P>
<P>
 And he worked, beginning as a "go-fer" on "The New Dick Van Dyke Show," shot 
at his father's small production studio in Arizona, where the elder Van Dyke 
had decided to "retire" before being persuaded to return to television. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick's son held cue cards, ran the transportation department and basically 
gathered production experience. But he always wanted to be in front of the 
camera. Finally, he got his wish: He landed a job as an extra. More extra work 
and small parts followed. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he got really lucky. He landed a development deal with ABC. Although 
initially pigeonholed in comedy, his father's milieu, Van Dyke found he had 
more of an affinity for action-adventure. Regular series work followed, 
including "Battlestar Gallactica" and "Airwolf." 
</P>
<P>
 And Van Dyke may be following in his father's footsteps in more ways than one: 
He's got his own family dynasty in the works. During his first foray into 
"entertainment," Van Dyke took tickets at a local movie theater, where he met 
his wife Mary, when they were both 16. They married seven years later, when Van 
Dyke was working as an extra. The Van Dykes have four children: Carey, 18; 
Shane, 14; Wes, 9, and Taryn, 7. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems his kids are eager to work with their dad too. The Van Dyke family, 
who surf and dirt-bike together, is hoping to start its own production company 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Diagnosis Murder" airs Fridays at 8 p.m. on CBS.

FOCUS; STRICTLY NOT 'LA BOHEME'; PBS BRINGS AUSTRALIAN DIRECTOR'S UPDATE OF THE 
OPERA TO 'GREAT PERFORMANCES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 31, Baz Luhrmann is no Wunderkind operatic stage director, but he's 
certainly younger than many of his international colleagues. And, some would 
say, more imaginative. 
</P>
<P>
 The Australian director's updated "La Boheme" -- created for the Sydney-based 
Australian Opera in 1990 and shown on PBS' "Great Performances" series 
Wednesday -- was his first operatic assignment. It predated his internationally 
acclaimed film, the award-winning "Strictly Ballroom," by two years. 
</P>
<P>
 And it happened only because of another music/theater project that made a mark 
for Luhrmann, he remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Luhrmann recalls, "I did a music/theater piece in the outback," the 
"enormous success" of which was noted by the operatic powers that be in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
 Luhrmann was then invited by the company to stage its new "Boheme," ostensibly 
reset in 1950s Paris with the purpose of bringing "a new, young audience to 
opera." (Puccini's most popular opera originally took place in the French 
capital in 1830.) 
</P>
<P>
 The tactic worked. The audiences came. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was the production -- with semi-abstract sets, brightly colored, 
20th-Century costumes and actually young principals -- artistically and 
financially successful, it also reportedly cost less than most of the company's 
recent productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Luhrmann went on to create a new opera, "Lake Lost," with composer Felix 
Meagher, which also succeeded with the public. Then, again for Australian 
Opera, he tackled a new mounting of Benjamin Britten's "A Midsummer Night's 
Dream." That has also been well received; this summer the Australian company, 
with Luhrmann in charge, takes it to the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
 The stage director's worldwide fame, however, has come from his 1992 hit film, 
"Strictly Ballroom," on the surface a backstage look at ballroom competitions, 
Down Under. Modestly, Luhrmann has called it "a very simple fairy tale, treated 
in a highly theatricalized way." 
</P>
<P>
 When he was first approached to direct an opera, "I hadn't seen a lot of 
operas," says Luhrmann, by phone from Melbourne. "So, I started attending. I 
found that 90% of the operas I saw didn't work. They were simply concerts with 
shaky sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I did see some successful productions, I realized that what the great 
composers -- Mozart or Puccini or whoever -- were doing was not writing concert 
music. They were telling a story." 
</P>
<P>
 He subsequently spent a year preparing the production, all the time with the 
idea of "going back to the notion of a story being told in music." 
</P>
<P>
 He went to Paris, "to the roots of the (Henry) Murger story, to the places 
which gave birth to Bohemianism," which inspired Puccini. Luhrmann's purpose, 
he says, was "to make the storytelling as rich and clear as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Luhrmann acknowledges that "theatrical opera on television doesn't usually 
work, because it can't capture the connection between the audience and the 
cast." This "Boheme," for instance, used visible stagehands who moved the sets 
and were literally in the faces of the theater audience. "It's a little like a 
photocopy," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 After concluding his trek to Edinburgh, Luhrmann will go back to film work. He 
has a 20th Century Fox production deal, "allowing me to continue my work in the 
theater," while dreaming up more film projects. Next year, he says, he will 
make a film in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't do a lot of projects because each thing I do seems to take a couple 
of years." 
</P>
<P>
 In "La Boheme," a young cast of Australian singers -- this performance was 
filmed in Sydney in January, 1993 -- is headed by Cheryl Barker as Mimi and 
David Hobson as Rodolfo. Hobson is scheduled to make his United States debut in 
San Francisco Opera's "Dangerous Liaisons" in September; in Australia, he has 
been called "the Mel Gibson of opera." The conductor is Julian Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "La Boheme" airs on "Great Performances" Wednesday at 7 p.m. KCVR and 9 p.m. 
on KCET, and KPBS .

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: BRINY DINING IN BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>

 For months a team of craftsmen from the Northwest had been pounding and 
sawing, fitting mahogany panels to the walls and stained glass to the ceiling. 
By mid-May, the oyster prints and photos of Beverly Hills in the '20s and '30s 
had been hung on the walls, the brass coat hooks screwed to the ends of the 
luxuriously ample booths. And the latest fish house from McCormick & Schmick, 
the Portland-based seafood restaurant chain, was ready to open. 
</P>
<P>
 Set at the top of a mock village lane at Two Rodeo, the Fish House serves a 
very similar menu to the slew of other McCormick & Schmick seafood houses in 
the West. The setting just has a bit more cachet. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no question -- of course you'll have the oysters, preferably the 
sampler of six different types from the Northwest coast. They're presented on 
the half shell, in order, so you can get to know their names. Forget the 
horseradish, these little beauties need only a drop of lemon to bring out their 
flavor. The oyster stew, laced with whole shucked oysters and bits of celery, 
doesn't stint on cream. 
</P>
<P>
 For a restaurant's first week, the kitchen was running remarkably smoothly. 
The menu, which is printed every day, offers a number of seafood appetizers, 
including seafood potstickers, live crawfish steamed with white wine Cajun 
butter and a bay shrimp and avocado quesadilla. But the restaurant's strength 
is in straightforward seafood classics. Without our having to ask, both the 
Copper River king salmon baked on a cedar plank and the Sacramento River 
sturgeon were cooked just until rare at the center. The couple ensconced at the 
booth across the way, however, were really swimming against the tide here, 
putting away not swordfish or halibut, but an impressive grilled T-bone. 
</P>
<P>
 * McCormick & Schmick's the Fish House, 206 N. Rodeo Drive at Two Rodeo, 
Beverly Hills, (310) 859-0434. Open for lunch and dinner daily. Full bar. Valet 
parking at Dayton Way entrance. All major credit cards. Appetizers $4.95-$9.95, 
entrees $9.95-$19.95.

RESTAURANT NEWS: DON'T STIFF SERVERS -- SNITCH ON THEM 
</P>

 Four customers showed up last Saturday at an Italian restaurant in Van Nuys 
for a quick bite on the way to the airport. When the waiter finally arrived at 
their table, one of the diners said, "We know what we want and we're ready to 
order."  
</P>
<P>
 "Well," the waiter insisted, "I'm going to tell you the specials anyway," and 
proceeded to recite the list. Then when the customers again tried to order, he 
walked away, ignoring their request. "I'll be back in a few minutes," he said, 
"when you're ready to order." Later, when he eventually cleared away the 
dishes, he dropped a dirty knife on one of the diners and headed back to the 
kitchen without so much as an apology. Opting not to make a scene in the tiny 
restaurant by complaining to the manager, the customers vowed never to return. 
</P>
<P>
 Chances are this would never have happened at a restaurant owned by Michael 
Franks and Robert Bell. The partners -- who own the successful South Bay 
restaurants Chez Melange in Redondo Beach; Fino, Misto, and Depot in Torrance, 
and the newly opened Descanso in Hermosa Beach -- telephone customers the next 
day for feedback on the dining experience. They initiated the policy over a 
year ago. Every morning they call three or four lunch and dinner customers from 
each restaurant to see how everything went, and then post the comments on a 
board for employees to read. 
</P>
<P>
 "I work the dining rooms all the time," says Franks, "but after a while I 
realized that most people are just very nice and don't want to tell you if 
anything's wrong. The next day when they've had a chance to think it over and 
aren't going to upset anybody, then they'll give you a fair critique. If there 
is something negative, it's better we know about it." 
</P>
<P>
 According to a recent study conducted by Yankelovich Partners for MasterCard, 
60% of restaurateurs surveyed reported diners are becoming more vocal in their 
criticism of service. But although customers may be complaining more, it's not 
all downhill. Twice as many felt that service on the whole had actually 
improved as those who didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Eric, chef/owner of Vida, which recently opened in the former Duplex 
space on Hillhurst, is usually too busy in the kitchen to spend much time in 
the dining room, so he has had cards printed up and placed at each table asking 
to be rated on everything from reservation handling and service to the quality 
of the food and wine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a way (customers) can leave comments," he says, "and I can get some 
direct feedback rather than just wait and wonder why the restaurant closed. 
Plus, it allows the public to say something if they need to without having to 
confront a server." 
</P>
<P>
 Joachim Splichal uses a similar system to get customers' comments at both 
Patina and Pinot. At Arnold Schwarzenegger's Schatzi on Main in Santa Monica, 
general manager Mark Ehrli says they will do practically anything to please a 
customer, from preparing a dish differently than the way it is described on the 
menu to running out to get cigarettes or putting a quarter in the parking 
meter. "Our guests come in and ask if we can do this or that, and I always say 
we can," says Ehrli, "because a lot of other people are saying no." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happened to the notion of just leaving a bad tip for bad service? 
"What does that say?" responds Vida's Eric. "It says you're cheap." 
</P>
<P>
 OPENING WINDOWS: Joe Baum, co-owner of the Rainbow Room atop Rockefeller 
Center's General Electric Building, will soon be running another massive 
Manhattan rooftop space: Windows on the World at the World Trade Center, closed 
since the February, 1993 bombing. The Port Authority of New York and New 
Jersey, which manages the building, invited 35 restaurant groups to submit 
proposals to run the landmark restaurant, which had been operated by a division 
of Hilton International. But, according to the New York Observer, only four 
bothered to compete: David Bouley, chef/owner of the top-rated Bouley; Alan 
Stillman, owner of five restaurants including the popular steakhouse Smith & 
Wollensky; Warner LeRoy, owner of Tavern on the Green, and Baum, who was 
responsible for the original look of Windows and supervised its operation until 
1978. At one time the largest-grossing restaurant in America, Windows on the 
World is set to reopen in late 1995.

 CHEFS MOVES: Peter Raub, the former chef/owner of Santa Fe Market in Santa Fe, 
is now cooking at Cobalt Cantina on Sunset Boulevard. . . . Mark Wexler, 
formerly at Schatzi on Main, is now in charge of the kitchen at Roxxi in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 WORLD CUP: Pasadena isn't the only place hoping to cash in on the 1994 World 
Cup, which begins June 17. Several Beverly Hills restaurants, including 
Lawry's, Maple Drive, the Players, Tatou, Silver Grille and Coley's Kitchen are 
hoping to attract some of those soccer-fan dollars too. The restaurants have 
banded together to offer a monthlong special three-course prix-fixe menu for 
$19.94.  
</P>
<P>
 REOPENED: Bruno's Ristorante -- the antique-filled Mar Vista institution known 
for its huge, reasonably priced wine list -- has reopened after being closed 
for five years. Bruno's son, Chris Tesari, has changed some things. The wine 
list is smaller. The prices are lower. And some new dishes have been added to 
the menu.

JAZZ, STRAIGHT AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If NBC Entertainment President Warren Littlefield did indeed say to Branford 
Marsalis that "the world is the way it is, and the world does not like jazz," 
he betrays an astonishing amount of both ignorance and arrogance ("Call It a 
Commercial Break," by Don Heckman, May 22). 
</P>
<P>
 Arrogance because America is not the world. The rest of the world has 
cherished jazz since the 1920s, when this emerging art form became one of our 
country's most popular and enduring exports. In other countries, American jazz 
artists are treated like royalty. Statues are erected to them, streets are 
named after them, radio and television networks dedicate programs to them and 
commission music from them. 
</P>
<P>
 In America, of course, it's a different story -- one of the main reasons being 
that the mainstream media, such as NBC and the other networks, most radio 
stations, newspapers and record companies, give jazz very little exposure. 
Naturally, the less exposure it receives, the less of an audience it has. Could 
this be because jazz was developed by and continues to be created primarily by 
African American artists? Just asking. 
</P>
<P>
 It's interesting to note that when Bill Cosby ruled the roost at NBC, one of 
the characters on his show was a retired jazz musician, and Cosby regularly 
brought on honest-to-goodness, jazz artists for guest appearances. Sure hurt 
his ratings, didn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 In our quixotic battle to see that jazz retains its rightful place in the 
cultural life of the country that gave it birth, our organization will focus 
much of its efforts on school-age children, who aren't quite as close-minded 
yet but enjoy whatever they truly enjoy and communicate that enjoyment to 
others.

 I am writing to protest the quote from Warren Littlefield that "the world does 
not like jazz." This is a myth that has been perpetuated by the music industry 
for some time, and I, for one, am disgusted by it. 
</P>
<P>
 From my 30 years of experience at being a jazz musician, I can testify to the 
fact that people do like jazz. All kinds of people: rock fans, country fans, 
you name it. 
</P>
<P>
 Every place that my group has played has had to turn away people as soon as 
they found out they could hear the music that nobody is supposed to like being 
played there. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that people do not have the opportunity to hear jazz. In every 
public place and in every workplace, formula junk is relentlessly shoved down 
our throats. "The Tonight Show" evidently wants to join the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody ever mentions the fact that the music business in this country was 
built on jazz: Woody Herman, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Sarah Vaughan, Ella 
Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong. Instead, the business has effectively killed jazz 
-- you never see a jazz artist on the Grammy show, and I guess now you won't be 
seeing many on "The Tonight Show" either.

 Anybody who thinks Eddie Vedder is a crybaby hasn't met Branford Marsalis. The 
elitist arrogance and apologetic whining that he demonstrates in his interview 
are exactly the kind of attitudes that keep jazz and jazz musicians in the 
cellar. Insulting fellow musicians and the public is not the way to win 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 This guy sold out, and now he's crying the blues because things aren't going 
so great. His plan to "educate" America has flopped. The public doesn't 
appreciate him, his fans think he's a traitor, and the network would like him 
to play music people want to hear . 
</P>
<P>
 If people don't dig this stuff they just don't get it. We're too stooopid. 
Hey, guy, a lot of people who like jazz don't understand it. And a lot of 
people understand it and are bored by most of it. Accept it. Just because you 
play jazz doesn't make you the smartest person on the planet. Or the coolest. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsalis can insult the other talk-show bands all he wants. I've been in David 
Letterman's audience a number of times. When the band plays through a 
commercial break, the audience doesn't watch the commercials -- it listens to 
the band. 
</P>
<P>
 If Marsalis is too good for the show, he should get off it and quit suffering. 
No one will notice. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 I was one of the people who actually used to watch "The Tonight Show With Jay 
Leno" to hear Branford Marsalis and his band. Heckman's article just confirmed 
my suspicions about the diminution of jazz on the show. 
</P>
<P>
 It is quite clear that "The Tonight Show" now considers even lesser-known 
country and rock performers better guests than the greatest of jazz musicians. 
NBC's position is that it doesn't want to scare away its audience by playing 
snippets of what it considers to be inaccessible music. Yet I think the 
audience might surprise them. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, and I don't blame Leno or Marsalis, one of America's true art forms 
is once again slighted.

CROONING CAMEOS! IT'S JULIO IGLESIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>

 Singer Julio Iglesias is scheduled to make a cameo appearance on "General 
Hospital" on Thursday and Friday. In the story line, music manager Lois Cerullo 
(played by Rena Sofer), will take Miguel Morez (played by Ricky Martin) on a 
tour of a high-tech recording studio during a visit to New York City. Lois will 
meet and talk with Iglesias, and try to get some facts about Miguel's past from 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Iglesias episodes of "General Hospital," there will be a 
performance of "Crazy," the Patsy Cline classic that is also the title song of 
Iglesias' new album. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 If Randy Brooks, the newest member of "Another World," looks familiar, it's 
probably because you have seen him on "The Young and the Restless," where he 
played the role of Nathan Hastings for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 On "Another World," Brooks is creating the role of book editor Marshall 
Lincoln Kramer III. Brooks, who was reduced to a non-contract status on "Young 
and Restless" in the fall of 1993, had been looking for a full-time acting job 
when his "Another World" role came along. 
</P>
<P>
 In the story line, Marshall and romance writer Felicia Gallant, played by 
Emmy-winning actress Linda Dano, did not hit it off when she learned he was to 
be her new book editor. But, if there is one thing you learn after watching a 
lot of soap operas, it is the fact that the couple who hates each other in the 
beginning usually ends up being lovers or -- at the very least -- very good 
friends. So it could be that there is an interracial romance in the offing for 
"Another World." 
</P>

<P>
 Kimberly McCullough, who plays Robin Scorpio on "General Hospital," recently 
returned from eight fabulous days in Oahu, Hawaii, where she performed with her 
high-school dance team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do mainly jazz dance," says McCullough, who adds she has been dancing 
"since I was born." 
</P>
<P>
 According to McCullough, teams gathered from the West Coast for this event. 
"There were a few teams from the different Hawaiian islands, one from Utah, 
another from Arizona," she says. "It was sort of an exhibition, because there 
really weren't enough teams to compete." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the exhibition, McCullough also got in some quality relaxation 
time. "That was great," she smiles. "I got to hang out on the beach and go 
shopping. It was so much fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The one thing McCullough didn't come back with was the "souvenir," for lack of 
a better word, that co-star John J. York (Mac Scorpio) had requested. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was supposed to bring him back Maui chips," she says, referring to a 
popular snack food on the islands. "He says they're great. But I couldn't find 
them anywhere. Actually, I didn't have any room in my suitcase for anything 
else. If I had brought them back, I probably would have crushed them anyway."

A DISSENTING VIEW ON CHINA, DISSIDENTS AND TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm a business person, and I resent "Question of Conscience" (May 15), which 
again tries to sell us the perception that on June 3, 1989, Chinese troops 
mounted a "brutal assault on peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators in Tian An 
Men Square." If you check the videos made before June 3, you can see students 
pulling unarmed soldiers off their trucks, beating them up and setting fire to 
their trucks as well as Chinese leaders trying to negotiate peacefully with 
student leaders, to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also patently manipulative to imply that a letter sent by a California 
business group to Clinton that supports continued most-favored-nation status 
for China reflects a position whose outlook "not all U.S. companies share," as 
if all companies are obliged to always share the same outlook on everything. 
Any time someone tries to sell me a "nobody-never-always" bill of goods, I know 
they're just trying to fiddle with my brain, because in the real world nothing 
involves everything or everybody, always. 
</P>
<P>
 What our amateur social engineers in the media seem to overlook are three 
facts: 
</P>
<P>
 * That the current Chinese leaders -- like it or not -- were the ones 
accountable for keeping the peace among the 1.2 billion people who did not 
behave in a socially irresponsible Chinese manner and, had 1% social chaos 
spread throughout China, it could have caused 12 million Chinese to perish. 
</P>
<P>
 * That when honorable folks want to meddle in other peoples' lives, they have 
the guts to send along a blank check for any damages that their meddling may 
cause others. 
</P>
<P>
 * That we brought the Cold War to an end, and in so doing put an end to the 
inconsequential political word games of the last 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 China's leaders seem to have caught on that the new game involves the 
practical application of money, bottom lines and access to markets. To the 
extent this is so, it is stupid to continue to interpret Chinese decisions as 
any more than simply knowing how to play the new game well by leveraging 
China's massive market, no differently than any major market.

SALES ARE THE MAIN ELECTRIC CAR CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A clue to the viability of electric cars was found in "Chrysler Plans Electric 
Version of Minivan" (May 6). 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler announced that they will build battery-powered vehicles to meet 
California's 1998 zero-emissions standards, but their vice president for 
engineering said that this fact will not necessarily produce customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The reality is that a mandate by the government does not ensure the sale of a 
product in our market-driven economy. When the public realizes the initial cost 
of an electric vehicle, the short distance of from 50 to 100 miles to be driven 
before fill-up (recharging), the time required for a fill-up (20 minutes to an 
hour) and the acceleration of the vehicle, any manufacturer will be fortunate 
to achieve the required 2% sales by 1998. Profit may be a dirty word to some 
people, but not to manufacturers. And there will certainly be no profit on such 
small-scale production.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: SOMETIMES YOU JUST CAN'T CURB THE URBAN ANIMAL WITHIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN, Robin Abcarian's column is published Wednesdays and Sundays. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A car, a couple of runners, a confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a total urban moment, that split second in which your civilized veneer 
peels away and you become what you detest -- an angry animal ready to pounce.  
</P>
<P>
 My partner and I were trotting toward the beach on the first leg of a 
three-mile workout. We have to cross three busy streets to get to the 
unrestricted seaside portion of our run, and we do so at our peril. 
</P>
<P>
 But we are thrill seekers. We eschew traffic lights in favor of the far more 
dangerous crosswalks, strewn like mines across our path. After complaining 
about our husbands' lack of affinity for dirty diapers (10 minutes), gossiping 
about our co-workers (10 minutes), we often fill the remaining time discussing 
the relative merits of crosswalks and stop lights. We have come to the 
conclusion that the traffic engineers are right: Crosswalks provide pedestrians 
with a false sense of security and not much else. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, we feel self-righteous about our rights-of-way and have developed a few 
techniques to get drivers to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes we put our hands in the air and command them to "Stop . . . in the 
name of love, before you break my legs." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes we flail our arms, looking panicked, so they think something is 
wrong. Occasionally, this shocks drivers out of their stupor. 
</P>
<P>
 More often than not, we are the ones who stop, because most Los Angeles 
drivers regard the sight of a person standing in a crosswalk as an optional 
stop, not a required one. They might stop, but only if they are feeling 
especially gracious and aren't too busy putting on lipstick, checking their 
hair plugs in the rear-view mirror or chatting on the car phone. 
</P>
<P>
 I have no idea what the guy in the Mercedes was doing when we entered the 
crosswalk. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the day in question, we were plodding westward and were halfway across the 
intersection when a black southbound Mercedes seemed as if it were going to 
barrel right through the crosswalk, and -- by extension -- us. 
</P>
<P>
 At the last minute, the driver slammed on his brakes. The nose of his car came 
to a stop rather too close to our calves for comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 I took revenge, as I usually do, by walking verrrry slooowwly in front of his 
car -- the better to annoy him for being in such a hurry and for scaring us. 
</P>
<P>
 My highly verbal, ultra-sophisticated running partner, however, turned on him. 
</P>
<P>
 "You (expletive often used for emphasis) (vulgarity for rear end)!" 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, who I guess wasn't in a hurry after all, lowered his passenger 
window. "What did you call me?" 
</P>
<P>
 She reprised her comments, this time con brio . 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey!" he yelled, "I stopped for your fat (expletive used for emphasis) 
(vulgarity for rear ends)!" 
</P>
<P>
 Some alien force -- afflicted with coprophilia -- invaded my body and took 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 It wheeled me around. It opened my mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 I heard my voice: "Eat (should be obvious), you (a compound vulgar noun that I 
would be embarrassed if my mother were able to figure out by reading this)!" 
</P>
<P>
 I was shocked. Such profanity, such angry poetry, such pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 Where did that come from? 
</P>
<P>
 And why did it feel so good? 
</P>
<P>
 In a trice, I viscerally understood Jack Nicholson wanting to attack the car 
of that poor guy (well, formerly poor now that they've settled) who cut him off 
in traffic at Toluca Lake in February. (Nicholson was driving . . . a black 
Mercedes.) If I'd had a golf club on me, who knows what might have happened? 
</P>
<P>
 The afterglow, I must say, was incredible. 
</P>
<P>
 Best run we've had in weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, I avoid such entanglements. Like crosswalks, they are dangerous and 
unpredictable. You enter at your own risk. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose we thought we were safe because someone driving a luxury car has too 
much to lose to really get nutty (pompous actors excepted) or maybe because we 
were steps away from a staircase leading to the beach, an easy escape. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was something discomfitingly invigorating about this exchange. Maybe 
it just felt good to yell. Maybe we just needed to relieve our pent-up 
frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet . . . isn't that why we run? 
</P>
<P>
 Could the stress of running in the city, wondered my partner, outweigh the 
benefits? 
</P>
<P>
 We spent the rest of our jog devising fabulous, witty things we wished we'd 
said to the Mercedes driver. His presumed anatomical shortcomings were high on 
our list of imagined ripostes. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe there's something wrong with me, but I kind of hope we see him again.

ADVICE TO YOUNG COPS AS THEY START CAREERS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re your recent piece about three young LAPD officers one year after their 
entry into the exciting -- sometimes shocking -- world of professional law 
enforcement ("Welcome to the Real World," May 19). Although I applaud zeal in 
any occupation, we can only hope that these highly trained and appropriately 
sensitive citizen warriors never have the misfortune of being present during an 
unusually difficult arrest (i.e. the Rodney King fiasco), or worse, attempt to 
make the arrest themselves in front of a video camera.

SNIFF AROUND FOR MORE THAN PUPPY LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With reference to Stephanie Miller's article "Mere Men Are No Match for Puppy 
Love" (Laugh Lines, May 13): There are many men who are sensitive and caring 
with the ability to know and understand their feelings, and with the compassion 
to hear a woman's needs and feelings.These men are communicative and can 
discuss subjects of interest besides sports. I did not appreciate the inference 
that this is the way men behave. I believe Ms. Miller has not met the right man 
or men.

DIVORCE RESEARCH NEEDS MORE OBJECTIVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So, without any interviewing of the children, their teachers, relatives or 
other caretakers, Constance Ahrons concluded that "50% of divorces do not do 
long-term damage to children or adults" ("Can Divorces Be Civilized for the 
Sake of the Kids?" May 25). 
</P>
<P>
 She interviewed 98 divorced couples in the Midwest three times over five 
years.This is rigorous science? I was perplexed until I read that Ahrons 
"struggled to attain a civilized divorce herself. Although she and her 
ex-husband never became friendly after the divorce. . ." 
</P>
<P>
 I question whether her research technique didn't break the cardinal rule of 
science: objectivity, in expunging guilt for her personal failure. Nonetheless, 
her conclusion of 50% long-term damage for children and adults is too high to 
be pushed aside to justify the lack of commitment values in our society today.

Johnson & Higgins, Transamerica, Occidental, Arthur Andersen and all of you who 
are here today that regularly demonstrate their willingness and dedication to 
making Los Angeles a better and safer place to live and work." Said she: "We do

SUMO DESERVES BETTER THAN A BELLY LAUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sumo finally breaches the surface of an American newspaper ("One Sport Where a 
Match Is a Dinner Break," Laugh Lines, May 24) and all we get is adolescent 
snickering over the same three stale, cliched jokes: They eat so much. The 
matches are over quickly.They're so faaaat!! Not to mention the completely 
erroneous designation of the sport as sumo "wrestling." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course the article was intended as humor. But at the risk of sounding 
cranky and humorless, may I please point out that quite a few Americans are 
legitimately interested in sumo as a sport, and that many more would be were it 
not that the only coverage it receives is unpleasantly close to ridicule? Why 
not describe the techniques used by the rikishi, their years of rigorous 
training, their dedication to their sport -- which far exceeds that of spoiled, 
overpaid, drug-addled American athletes -- and the fact that many a middle-aged 
businessman carries a higher percentage of body fat? 
</P>
<P>
 Sumo can be enjoyed as an exciting sport without resorting to either drooling 
cultural reverence or characterization as the human equivalent of monster 
trucks. Those who wish to pursue thoughtful exchange on the grand sport of sumo 
are invited to contact the Pasadena Sumo Assn., 686 S. Arroyo Parkway, Suite 
299, Pasadena, Calif. 91105.

ADDITIONAL VOLLEYS ON GUN CONTROL

 Your Bob Corbin story ("The Straight Shooter," May 18) is beautifully written 
and beautifully informative. Thank you for it.

<P>
 For the record, I am not a member of the NRA.I am a reserve law-enforcement 
officer, however, and am sworn to defend the Constitution. And I'm trained to 
assume that every suspect has a weapon until I've determined otherwise. I have 
no reason to believe that any gun-control legislation will negate that 
training.

 Re: Bob Corbin, gun zealot. I'd like to ask him and his ilk a question or two: 
Who do you think is more dangerous -- the solitary criminal with just guile and 
a criminal instinct, or a nationwide lobbying organization bent on protecting 
the right to be macho, meanwhile enabling easy acquisition of guns by the above 
criminal and any other nefarious person who desires? 
</P>
<P>
 Can there be any doubt that one of our most prominent legacies reviewed by 
historians will be that of being the most violent society to ever occupy a plot 
of soil on this planet? People of the future as well as the majority of 
citizens now must shake their heads as they ponder how much longer we can go on 
dispatching 50,000 of more of our own citizens each year while we are 
supposedly at peace.

UP ALL NIGHT: PRAISE THE LORD AND PASS THE BISCUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The club scene has gotten religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Gospel brunches -- that fiery, soul-lifting combination of African American 
Baptist singing and high-cholesterol Southern food -- have taken hold. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a year on the first Sunday of every month, the Lord has been 
praised and the calories damned at the Derby on Los Feliz Boulevard. Now the 
newly opened House of Blues, on Sunset, is hosting its own spiritual brunch 
each Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some folks take it as a form of entertainment," says Ollie Collins Jr., a 
missionary Baptist who recently arranged for the music at the House of Blues. 
Collins' gospel-country roots stretch back to Tupelo, Miss., where his brother, 
Andrew, had "interchange on the guitar" with a 9-year-old Elvis Presley at the 
Happy Feed Store. 
</P>
<P>
 "For others, this will change their lives," Collins says with a nod. "One 
never knows who is planted in an audience. God works in mysterious ways." 
</P>
<P>
 On this Sunday, those firmly planted before formidable plates of rich food are 
a predominantly white, prosperous crowd (BMWs and Range Rovers fill the parking 
lot) who take to the music as though they'd been singing "hallelujah" all their 
lives. As one brunch-goer, Annabelle Stevens, says: "There's so few places in 
L.A. that have oomph." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 250-strong crowd sit family-style at four 20-foot-long tables 
covered in white clothes that radiate from the stage. The idea is to duplicate 
Southern pot luck and tent revivals, where different church congregations would 
come together, their choirs would sing and parishioners would bring special 
dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of food, the House of Blues provides the pot luck. Three buffets are 
set with omelet stations, jambalaya, barbecue chicken and chocolate whiskey 
cake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud of this," says chef Ken Frank, formerly of La Toque. "This is what 
this club is about. I really believe this is the best thing we can do for L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are some who say religious music has no place in a club where 
drinking and dancing go on, singer Andrew Williams says: "You're supposed to 
spread the Gospel. Gospel is good anywhere, anytime." He performs with the 
Sweet Singing Cava-Leers, four middle-aged men with a three-man backup group on 
electric guitar and drums. 
</P>
<P>
 While Dustin Hoffman stops by the dressing room to say how much he enjoyed the 
performance, Williams says the group doesn't change its style at all for the 
House of Blues crowd. "We sing exactly the way we do in a Baptist church. We 
don't take anything back." 
</P>
<P>
 Lead singer Walter Cook, who has been with the group for 40 years, sits nearby 
with his shirt off. Sweat pours from his ample body. As he looks for his 
cigarette lighter, he mentions that the Lord has helped him survive three heart 
attacks. When he's told the Lord helps those who help themselves, he laughs 
heartily, but still lights up. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at the people here today," he says. "A lot of them don't go to black 
Baptist or any other kind of church. They've never seen people rejoice. Some of 
them aren't sure what they should do. Some think they should get up and dance." 
</P>
<P>
 As food is brought to the singers, Collins reflects on the morning with the 
Cava-Leers. The consensus is that singing gospel at the House of Blues is good 
for both them and the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have to know all what happens, but something good did happen," 
Collins says. "We know by Scripture it won't return void. It will accomplish 
what it set out to do." 
</P>

 It seems Peter Stringfellow was a bit disappointed by his brush with glamour. 
At least that's what the British club owner, who built his eponymously named, 
financially fatal club in Beverly Hills' Two Rodeo complex in 1991, told 
England's Independent newspaper last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the answer Stringfellow gave to the question, "What was your biggest 
disappointment?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles -- after I spent $3.5 million opening the most glamorous club 
there. I lived in Beverly Hills and that was a disappointment, my club's 
success was a disappointment, the people of Los Angeles were a disappointment, 
the coastline of L.A. down by Santa Monica was a disappointment. I found the 
whole experience disappointing and closed the club after a year and a half." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps this is nit-picking with a seriously disappointed man, but when he 
opened the club he said he had spent $4 million on it. And although he did 
close the club, it was in bankruptcy at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Stringfellow recovered from his disappointment by returning to his club in 
London, whose clientele was once described by London's Sunday Times as 
"traditionally a mixture of micro-celebrities (aging DJs are popular), Page 
Three girls, bewildered foreigners and folks from the suburbs." 
</P>

 From America, With Love: As part of America's cultural push abroad, 
Cosmopolitan has begun publishing in Russia. We got a copy of the mag's first 
cover and asked the Russian immigrant women who work in Cantor's bakery to 
translate the headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 At first there were some difficulties with this translation technique. This 
was because the women were laughing so much they could barely say the words. 
There was something about the picture of a model in a low-cut dress, the words 
sex and chocolate, and the idea that Cosmopolitan was being sold in Russia that 
made them laugh hysterically. 
</P>
<P>
 After much effort and drying of eyes with their apron corners, they said these 
are a few of the stories the former Soviets will be reading. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Sex or Chocolate: There's time for everything." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Test: How well do you know each other?" 
</P>
<P>
 * "Thirty years old, independent, sure of herself -- Does she need a husband?" 
</P>
<P>
 To that last story, one of the older women said, "Of course not! If I had all 
that, why would I get married?"

WESTSIDE WATCH: 50 YEARS LATER, THEY GET ANOTHER COLD RECEPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The D-day re-enactment at Santa Monica beach the other night was a bit too 
much like the real thing for some World War II veterans. Indeed, just like 50 
years ago, the erstwhile soldiers didn't know what they were getting into: cold 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 The soggy vets, many of them dressed in street clothes, had apparently been 
promised a dry landing on the sand this time around. Instead, they emerged from 
the sea wet up to their skivvies. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why they had agreed to take part in the re-enactment, Los Angeles 
resident Norman King, who landed at Utah beach on D-day, said: "Because we're 
stupid, that's why. We weren't supposed to get wet." 
</P>
<P>
 Though uniforms were optional for the bona-fide D-day veterans, there were 
plenty of non-soldiers who were decked out for the occasion in military garb. 
One Hawthorne architect who collects World War II uniforms even had a rifle 
strapped to his chest. He stood as a self-appointed sentry near the water's 
edge waiting for the faux invasion that opened a D-day commemoration put on by 
the French Consulate. 
</P>
<P>
 Even on live-and-let-live Santa Monica beach, the sight of a guy in full 
military regalia turned heads. 
</P>

 IN THE MAIL: It may be better than going to Dodger Stadium on Cap Day. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-El Segundo) has sent out tote bags, refrigerator 
magnets and other knickknacks along with his political mailers in his quest to 
win the 28th State Senate District primary on Tuesday. In that race, Dills 
faces Torrance Councilman George Nak no, attorney Mike Sidley and Manhattan 
Beach real estate broker Jo Ann Rodda. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnets are in the shape of saxophones, which go hand-in-hand with Dills' 
billboards. They depict the 84-year-old incumbent playing the sax and feature 
the slogan "Too Old to Quit." 
</P>
<P>
 According to his campaign, the freebies are just another way to introduce 
Dills to a batch of voters unfamiliar with him. He is running in a 
reapportioned district, where he is largely unknown in the beach cities from 
Venice to Palos Verdes Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone appreciated the largess, however. One day after Dills sent a 
ruler and an empty bullet shell along with a letter that underscored his 
support of public education and efforts to curb violence, someone called in a 
bomb threat to his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The person was offended by the bullet shell," said campaign official Shirley 
Scott, who took the call. "He said it was like an Italian receiving a dead 
fish." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott filed a report with the Torrance Police Department.

 CELEBRITY BACKING: A cornerstone of state Sen. Tom Hayden's unconventional run 
for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination is his limit on contributions to no 
more than $94 apiece -- an effort to emphasize his contention that modern-day 
politics has been corrupted by the influence on big money. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Hayden (D-Santa Monica) has attracted about 1,200 contributions from 
people backing his alternative message, said campaign manager Duane Peterson. 
And some of those contributors clearly could have afforded more. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Peterson, those sending in checks have included entertainer Chevy 
Chase and his wife, Jayni Chase ($188), singer Bonnie Raitt ($94) and former 
basketball star Bill Walton, who saw a Hayden ad in the New York Times, clipped 
the coupon and attached his $94 check.

BANKER FOUND GUILTY IN DRUG MONEY CASE; BEVERLY HILLS: TEXAS JURY CONVICTS A 
SENIOR OFFICER OF AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK INTERNATIONAL AND HIS ASSISTANT OF 
LAUNDERING $30 MILLION FOR A MEXICAN COCAINE KINGPIN. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Antonio Giraldi, whose Beverly Hills office looked more like a boutique than 
an international bank, thrived in a world far removed from that of drug dealers 
and their bags stuffed with cash. 
</P>
<P>
 But a federal jury in Brownsville, Tex., on Thursday connected those two 
worlds, finding him guilty of laundering $30 million for a drug organization 
headed by Juan Garcia Abrego of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is a good example of how a bank officer legitimized a drug dealer," 
Assistant U.S. Atty. David Novak said. 
</P>
<P>
 Giraldi, a boyish-looking senior officer for American Express Bank 
International, lowered his head as U.S. marshals escorted him in handcuffs out 
of the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors found him guilty on all charges: conspiracy, 10 counts of money 
laundering, two counts of bank fraud and four counts of misapplication of 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Giraldi's former assistant, Lourdes Reategui, 46, was found guilty of 
conspiracy, one count of bank fraud and four counts of misapplication of funds. 
She was acquitted of the 10 money laundering counts and a second bank fraud 
count. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela ordered Giraldi held on a $1-million cash 
bond until sentencing, which was scheduled for Aug. 12. Bond for Reategui was 
set at $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Giraldi is a senior vice president in the bank's Miami office. He worked in 
the bank's posh branch in Beverly Hills when many of the transactions occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Reategui, Giraldi's assistant in Beverly Hills, now works for a Los Angeles 
real estate company. 
</P>
<P>
 As the jury deliberated for over three days, Giraldi, 37, had paced the 
hallways, often patting reporters on the back, and making small talk about his 
hopes to return to work and take a mountain biking vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Giraldi probably faces at least a decade in a federal prison, 
depending on federal sentencing guidelines and on Vela. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot fathom how we arrived here," said Giraldi's attorney, Christopher 
Milner. "I think the basis for an appeal is clearly in the record based on the 
dearth of the evidence (against Giraldi)." 
</P>
<P>
 Reategui's attorney, Robert Turner, called the verdict inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jury has decided that my client is guilty of conspiracy and not guilty of 
the money laundering. You figure it out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon Barker-Benfield, a spokesman for American Express in New York, said: 
"We're greatly disappointed by the verdict. But we do emphasize that the bank 
does have a strict policy against doing business with clients engaged in 
criminal activities." 
</P>
<P>
 The three-week trial, watched closely by international banks, focused on the 
relationship between bank officers and their wealthy, often secretive clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys, whose fees were paid by American Express, contended that 
their clients had no reason to suspect that they were handling tainted money. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors charged that Giraldi and Reategui intentionally schemed and 
lied in bank records to make their biggest client, Ricardo Aguirre Villagomez, 
appear to be a legitimate businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 The government alleges that Aguirre, a gas station manager in Matamoros, 
Mexico, was handling millions of dollars for Abrego. 
</P>
<P>
 Abrego is the reputed head of a drug empire in northeastern Mexico that, 
according to federal agents, imports hundreds of tons of Colombian cocaine into 
the United States each year and generates more than $20 billion in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Customs Special Agent Vincent Iglio began the complex investigation in 
1989 when he and other agents noticed couriers hauling duffel bags stuffed with 
cash from a Mexican exchange house to a bank in McAllen, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 A Customs-led task force followed the money to accounts for Aguirre in 
Switzerland, then to Aguirre-controlled holding companies in the Cayman 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigators then found the money reinvested in apparently legitimate 
businesses in the United States and Mexico.

WEINTRAUB HEADS LIST OF HOPEFULS FOR CITY COUNCIL SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Los Angeles school board member Roberta Weintraub is seeking a 
political reincarnation -- this time as the successor to Los Angeles City 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who is expected to easily win election to the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors seat now held by Ed Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody should believe this will be a cakewalk, but I've got good name 
identification and I intend to win," said Weintraub, 58, as she assessed her 
prospects in a 5th City Council District election that is likely to produce 
many ambitious aspirants. 
</P>
<P>
 Other possible candidates for the open seat are Carol Schatz, vice president 
of the Central City Assn., an organization of downtown businesses; 
transportation consultant Ryan Snyder, vice president of the Los Angeles Board 
of Transportation Commissioners; Michael Feuer, executive director of Bet 
Tzedek legal services, and Yaroslavsky's wife, Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Weintraub, who resigned last June from the San Fernando Valley-based school 
board seat she had held since 1979, has already pumped $10,000 of her own money 
into her campaign coffers. Some political analysts wonder if Weintraub -- best 
known for leading the fight to dismantle the Los Angeles Unified School 
District's desegregation plan and whose political base has been in the Valley 
-- can pull votes on the liberal Westside. Sixty percent of Yaroslavsky's 
district is on the south side of Mulholland Drive, while the rest is in the 
Valley and includes Sherman Oaks and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 But Weintraub says she has a track record that easily transcends her 
reputation as a foe of court-ordered desegregation. She points to her role in 
establishing contraceptive-dispensing health clinics at high school campuses, 
setting up day-care centers for student mothers at schools in the east San 
Fernando Valley, and working to build a dozen magnet school programs that seek 
to offer an alternative curriculum to a multicultural student body. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Weintraub serves as a Mayor Richard Riordan appointee to the city's 
Library Commission, co-directs Students Run L.A., a group that trains 
youngsters to participate in the Los Angeles Marathon, and is an appointee to 
the Board of Governors of the California Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 If Weintraub were to win a seat on the City Council, it would amount to a 
reunion of sorts. Two other former Weintraub colleagues on the school board -- 
Jackie Goldberg and Rita Walters -- now sit on the council.

BRIEFLY; SCHOOL: SCHOLARSHIP NAMED FOR TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A future Cornell University student will receive a scholarship named for Dean 
P. Schenker, a University High School teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Schenker, who teaches honors and advanced placement English, was chosen by 
Christopher Goffard, a graduating senior at Cornell in Ithaca, N.Y., as the 
teacher who made the most significant contribution to his education. 
</P>
<P>
 The $4,000 scholarship, awarded over a four-year period in Schenker's name, 
will be given to a Hamilton High School student who attends Cornell. The award 
will be given to an incoming student from another Los Angeles city school if no 
one from Hamilton enrolls at Cornell. 
</P>
<P>
 Goffard, who was enrolled at Hamilton from 1988 to 1990, was named a Merrill 
Presidential Scholar at Cornell by his dean, based on his scholastic 
achievement and leadership ability.

ANIMALS; THIS VET'S PET PROJECT IS ACUPUNCTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Norton, acupuncture is no big deal. It's just another part of his day, 
like sniffing strangers and running around the yard. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the chocolate Labrador retriever looked a little bored as his owner, 
Venice veterinarian Marc Bittan, inserted five stainless steel needles -- each 
only slightly longer than a sewing needle -- into the dog's hindquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 From all appearances, Norton could just as well have been thinking about his 
supper while his human companion explained the principles of animal 
acupuncture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only does (acupuncture) cause no discomfort; most dogs actually get 
sedated," said Bittan, who makes house calls in a mobile unit. He said he has 
used acupuncture on about 100 Westside animals in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bittan said the procedure has proven effective on dogs he has treated for 
skeletal or stomach problems, and can be practiced on virtually any animal for 
a wide variety of ailments or health maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Norton, for instance, was not sick, but got what Bittan called "a tune-up, a 
feel-good shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Pet acupuncture is part of a larger trend toward holistic veterinary medicine, 
which includes using herbs and other non-traditional approaches to the 
treatment of disease. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 300 veterinary acupuncturists nationwide, and the number is 
growing by about 15% a year, according to the International Veterinary 
Acupuncture Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Some veterinarians have turned to acupuncture out of a frustration with 
traditional medications. 
</P>
<P>
 According to traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture works by stimulating 
and balancing chi , a life force that gathers around certain points on the body 
and has no analog in Western medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt that in some cases in treating animals, Western medicine was sometimes 
overwhelming," said Dr. Bill Farber, a West Los Angeles veterinarian who also 
incorporates acupuncture into about 10% of his practice. "The constant use of 
antibiotics and steroids is immuno-suppressive and possibly detrimental to an 
animal's internal organs. Sometimes the Eastern approach is just as effective." 
</P>
<P>
 While some U.S. veterinarians have practiced alternative medicine since at 
least the 1970s, the current trend dovetails with a growing interest in 
holistic medicine for human beings. 
</P>
<P>
 Bittan, for instance, said he became interested in acupuncture after his 
ex-wife earned a doctorate in homeopathy and began studying traditional Chinese 
medicine. He said he soon received acupuncture treatments for a sore throat and 
was surprised to discover he felt better afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "I swallowed hard, trying to make my throat hurt, because I couldn't believe 
it went away that fast," he said. "I was skeptical, but seeing is believing." 
</P>
<P>
 Pet owners have been similarly impressed with results on animals. Marlas 
Winston, owner of a Santa Monica health-food store, was worried when her 
14-year-old golden retriever, Shana, began having trouble getting up and 
climbing stairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Winston said she became disenchanted with conventional veterinary medicine 
after one doctor suggested giving the dog steroids "until she dies." 
</P>
<P>
 But since starting weekly visits to Farber several years ago, Shana has been a 
different dog, Winston said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Acupuncture has kept (Shana) alive," she said. "If she didn't have 
acupuncture, she couldn't even lift her body. It's worked wonders." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The orthodox veterinary community, not surprisingly, is taking a more guarded 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Veterinary Medical Assn., in its policy statement on alternative 
therapies, recognizes acupuncture as a valid form of treatment but warns that 
"the potential for abuse exists. These techniques should be regarded as 
surgical or medical procedures under state veterinary practice acts." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've heard (acupuncture) has been successful in some cases; in others it's 
not," said Madeline Bernstein, executive director of the Los Angeles Society 
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals/Southern California Humane Society, a 
private, non-profit group. "Our position is that it's important to do research 
on the person performing the procedure (and) make sure they have the proper 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 To Bittan, though, doubts about acupuncture reveal a blind spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at this," he said, holding up a package of needles emblazoned with a 
sticker warning that the contents were an "investigational device" regulated by 
federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, come on," he said, giving Norton a pat on the head. "Acupuncture has 
been practiced for thousands of years. It tells you something about the 
arrogance of our society."

COMMUNITY NEWS: WILSHIRE CENTER; HOTEL OFFERS SUNDAY BRUNCH DISCOUNT TO BENEFIT 
CHURCHES

<P>
 A new promotion by the Radisson Wilshire Plaza Hotel to drum up lunchtime 
business for its restaurant during noisy subway construction will also benefit 
Wilshire Center churches and nonprofit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel's Tulips Garden restaurant offers a 10% discount coupon for its 
Sunday brunch to members of participating churches.At the end of each month, 
the hotel donates 10% of the members' purchases back to the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at it as a positive way to help keep the hotel afloat during Metro 
Rail construction while also giving something back to the community," said 
Robert Mooney, the hotel's director of public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunday Brunch Community Discount Program began this month and so far 
consists of St. Basil's Catholic Church, Immanuel Presbyterian Church, Wilshire 
Christian Church and the First Congregational Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's wonderful for them to take that kind of initiative," said Linda 
Rees, administrator at Immanuel Presbyterian. "As a church we're trying to find 
more ways to interact with the community and use our own facilities to the 
maximum. So it's great to see (the hotel) also being very creative." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonprofit organizations in the Wilshire Center community are also invited to 
participate in the discount program, Mooney said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LEIMERT PARK; CENTER LENDS A HAND TO NEW HOME BUYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Operation Hope Vision Center, a consortium of loan officers from several 
banks seeking to increase home loans in the inner city, opened in Leimert Park 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, at Degnan Boulevard and 43rd Street in the Vision Center theater 
complex, will offer alternatives to people turned down for loans at traditional 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Staffed with loan officers from four lending institutions -- Fidelity Federal 
Bank, First Federal Bank of California, First Republic Thrift and Loan and 
South Pacific Thrift and Loan -- the center will work with first-time buyers to 
establish good credit. Home loans are virtually assured for clients willing to 
stick to a financial plan outlined by loan officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lance Triggs, the center's executive director, says the unique component of 
the program is case management. Clients who do not initially qualify go through 
six to 12 months of home buyer workshops, financial counseling and one-on-one 
mentoring to work up to a point where they can qualify for a loan. Credit 
portfolios will be established by looking at payment history of rent, utilities 
and other bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Triggs said the unusual lending approach is all in the spirit of encouraging 
banks to look at a total picture before assuming a prospective buyer is a bad 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fact that home loan defaults in the inner city are among the lowest 
anywhere," he said. "We want banks to not just identify problems, but also 
solutions. We don't want people to feel intimidated or cross-examined, as they 
often do in banks."  
</P>
<P>
 Loans will be funded by the Vision Fund, a "safety net" fund pool set up by 
the four participating institutions. Open only a week, the center has already 
approved loans for seven clients, Triggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is the brainchild of 27-year-old businessman and Operation Hope 
foundation founder John Bryant. He said he conceived the idea last year after 
realizing that lack of home ownership is a chief reason people feel they have 
little stake in their community. Triggs said he and Bryant, a longtime friend, 
believe it was no accident that virtually no homes burned during the 1992 
rioting.  
</P>
<P>
 "You don't burn that which you own," said Triggs, who plans to recruit clients 
through churches, businesses and grass-roots organizations. ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: RANCHO CIENEGA; DORSEY HIGH STUDENTS SHARE THE FRUITS OF THEIR 
LABOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a year and a half of hard work, a group of Dorsey High students have 
turned a neglected patch of their athletic field into an unlikely garden of 
greens -- as well as potatoes, watermelon, herbs and other fruits and 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, students and dignitaries celebrated the spring harvest in the 
garden with a spread including lemonade, chips and home-grown salsa. Once a 
practice spot for shotputters, the corner of Dorsey's track stadium is now 
fertile ground, thanks to the efforts of special education teacher Rene Klein 
and volunteers from the University of California's Cooperative Extension. 
</P>
<P>
 "My special-ed kids love the garden," said Klein, who supervises about 25 
students who tend the garden each week. "It's success-oriented, very 
therapeutic. . . . They've been really great with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite having handicaps ranging from mild learning disabilities to autism, 
students have faithfully tended the small plots since September, 1992. Klein 
received about $2,800 in grant money from Toyota, Phillips Petroleum and the 
Gas Co. for the garden, as well as equipment and volunteer donations from the 
nonprofit Common Ground garden program, C & S Nursery, Raindrip Inc., the state 
Department of Conservation and the city Environmental Affairs Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein said the greatest asset has been Elaine Miller, a volunteer with the 
University of California-sponsored Cooperative Extension, the agricultural 
equivalent of the UC extension program. Miller has worked closely with the 
students since the beginning, when the land, with too little topsoil to grow 
even weeds, had to be rehabilitated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to emphasize growing from seed so that students can really see the 
growing process," Miller said. "Students get their own beds or plots, and take 
responsibility for them. Once things are picked, they also learn how to share." 
</P>
<P>
 Klein and her crew look forward to the next phase of their project: They have 
begun building a roofed patio and erecting an arbor that will soon be covered 
with grapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest obstacle has been getting the water irrigation system in place," 
said Klein, "but now we're just fine." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: MALIBU; $1-MILLION ERROR IN BUDGET REVEALED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Finance officials erroneously added nearly $1 million in nonexistent cash 
reserves to the Malibu city budget over the past two years, inflating the 
general fund at a time when fires, floods and mudslides reduced revenues from 
sales taxes and other income sources, the City Council learned last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was quite surprised and not a little upset that staff could have overstated 
our cash position," Mayor Jeff W. Kramer said. "I do intend to get to the 
bottom of this, although I still don't quite understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 Former council member Walt Keller made the revelation at a meeting Wednesday 
night, saying he had caught the discrepancy when he compared the budget 
proposals for the last three years and reread a 1991-92 city audit. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the audit, which first revealed the $900,000 error in October, 1992, 
the mistake was carried over to the 1992-93 budget and into the proposed 
version of this year's budget, Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The audit shows the beginning of the problem, where it says that we should 
have been using a balance of $1,233,390 in July '92, but (City Finance Director 
Mark Lorimer) used $2,134,942 instead," Keller said. "The error was in the 
audit but was not pointed out to staff by the auditors." 
</P>
<P>
 Lorimer told the council that he had not used audit figures when calculating 
the city's budget for this year, but relied on projected figures instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question in my mind that the budget in this fiscal year got away 
from us," Councilman John Harlow said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Lorimer said he was working with the city's auditing firm, Peat 
Marwick, to try to come up with an explanation in time for the next council 
meeting June 13, when the budget is scheduled for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 Peat Marwick, which has looked over the city's books since Malibu was 
incorporated in 1991, has not completed the city's 1993-94 audit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As of last week, the city's total expenditures for 1994-95 were projected at 
$7.6 million, up from the $7.1 million actually spent during the current fiscal 
year. But the revelation of the nonexistent $900,000 cast that projection into 
doubt, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorimer said the city lost sales tax revenue because of traffic blocked during 
fires and storms. Utility tax revenue also decreased because nearly 300 homes 
burned down. 
</P>
<P>
 On the plus side, the city expects to receive about $1 million from the 
settlement of a 1992 lawsuit against Los Angeles County over what Malibu 
officials see as a miscalculation of property tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager David Carmany said it was determined that Malibu should have been 
getting about $3 million a year in property taxes as opposed to the $1 million 
a year it has received since incorporation in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 If the two parties agree on a figure, said City Atty. Christi Hogin, the 
county will pay "at least some of the money owed."

FOR SENIORS; TRAVELER, 71, IS ON THE ROAD AGAIN -- AS A DOCENT FOR L.A. 
CONSERVANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Spencer doesn't analyze things. Ask him a "why" question or a "how come" 
and he looks up at the ceiling for an answer. He never had a grand plan for 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a way, Spencer is like an explorer who moves from one big experience to 
another with zest and commitment. "If I get something out of it, fine. If not, 
I'm out of it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of his longtime marriage to wife Judy, Spencer's eight-year 
tenure as a volunteer docent with the Los Angeles Conservancy is a record for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 He was reading an article about what to do in L.A. and one of the suggestions 
was a walking tour of the Broadway movie theater district sponsored by the 
conservancy. He took the tour and the next week he volunteered to become a 
docent. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer was a shy person, had little to do with the public, never talked to 
strangers, and rarely volunteered for anything. "I was bored -- had nothing to 
do. My wife was ill and I was looking for something to do without getting into 
trouble," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer, 71, was born in New York City, moved to Boyle Heights with his family 
when he was a teen-ager and frequently went Downtown because it was the hub of 
the city. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin with a degree in 
mechanical engineering, and served in Okinawa with the Army in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 In classic Spenceresque, he describes his war experience in an almost 
matter-of-fact manner. "When you're 20 or 21, you don't think about it as a 
horrible experience. I was more intent worrying where my next beer was coming 
from than worrying about what a horrible experience it was," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, Spencer used his college degree for six years and became 
restless. Discounting was the new way to sell appliances. Spencer and a partner 
devised a catalogue to supply wholesalers with the up-to-date prices. Dealers 
loved it because they didn't have to make incessant phone calls. Spencer sold 
the book for a yearly subscription. He rented a mimeograph machine and hired a 
secretary. He made money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never set for life. Rich meant a paid-for car and $500 in the bank," he 
says. "After six years, we took the money and traveled. Came back and I had my 
last 'job' building an apartment house. Any idiot can build an apartment house 
so I put $10,000 together and built one myself. I made $5,000. And I thought, 
'You know what? This could be a living.' We took the profit and blew it on a 
trip through the Panama Canal." 
</P>
<P>
 When Spencer came back he built another apartment house, made a larger profit, 
packed up his wife and two children and took off for three months to Tahiti and 
the South Pacific. First-class. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Spencer does most of his traveling by introducing people to the city 
they call home but have never seen. His favorite spot is the Watts Towers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are always telling me how scared they are to go there. They're missing 
out. It's unique," he says. "One man worked 37 years and single-handedly built 
all 100 feet of it. And one day he just walked to his neighbor's house and gave 
him the deed and left town. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city owns it now and it's a shame because there's no money or interest in 
up-keeping it," Spencer says. "It's hard to describe the towers. Once you see 
this unique piece of art, you can get a high just leaning against it and 
looking up. We have no idea what was in the artist's mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer eventually wrote the tour he leads and did the voice-over for a public 
television special on the Watts Towers hosted by Huell Howser. He officially 
leads one tour a month but usually does more. 
</P>
<P>
 When he gets home he takes a five-mile walk to loosen up. It's tough for him 
to walk so slowly during the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 22, he's taking a group from a Downtown office building through the 
theater district. The conservancy is also featuring a series of classic films 
in the historic theaters during the entire month of June. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the effect you got when you went to one of these theaters," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was during the Depression when the Los Angeles Theatre opened. Inside, 
Albert Einstein was the guest of honor and outside were the bread lines. There 
was a ladies' room which was a haven for women to come to. Not only was it 
clean but it was spectacular -- like in a palace. Even the names of the 
theaters -- Palace, Majestic -- conjured up a fantasy. When a person went to 
the movies in those days it was like being king for a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Docents come from all walks of life but they all have one thing in common -- a 
love for a certain part of Los Angeles. Spencer has that but admits he's a 
lousy docent for architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 All docents are trained in five weekly sessions and devote one Saturday a 
month to leading a tour. Spencer also trains people and says anyone can be a 
docent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who can stand on their feet for two and a half hours is eligible," he 
says. "You don't need the knowledge; we'll give you that." 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer says he goes back to New York once a year "for a fix." But the Los 
Angeles Conservancy is an integral part of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 It keeps him moving. 
</P>
<P>

BIKE PATH: AN IN-LINE SKATER'S SIDE OF THE STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm one of the thousands of Angelenos who take pride and pleasure in our 
beautiful paved pathways along the glorious California coast. I'm also an 
in-line skater.Until your article, I was not aware that these paths are 
ostensibly the legal domain of bicyclists. I'm surprised and disappointed. In 
years of skating from Palisades to Venice to Marina del Rey to Torrance, I've 
never seen a "no skating" sign, nor has it ever occurred to me that "bikes 
only" on the pathways was meant to exclude anyone but pedestrians. Neither does 
my full-color bike path map, so graciously provided by the L.A. County 
Transportation Commission, make any mention in the listed rules and regulations 
that skating is prohibited. Even the company that originated in-line skating 
reinforces the idea that the path is not just for bikers by offering Saturday 
morning clinics at the Santa Monica Beach parking lot adjoining the bike path. 
</P>
<P>
 In-line skating and biking are simply different means to the same end. There 
are weekend warriors of both persuasions who make it unpleasant for those of us 
who enjoy the pathways' rich variety of recreation, sight and sound. I'm sorry 
if our French expatriate biker friend believes in-line skaters would be content 
rolling round and round in circles like horizontal hamsters. Perhaps she'd like 
to try putting bikers in rinks: Voila ! An infinite loop of frenzied cyclists 
in an endless chorus of "On your left!"

ELECTION: SEISMIC SAFETY ON FREEWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those of us who live or work in Santa Monica, Malibu, Pacific Palisades, or 
the Westside in general, know what a major impact the closure of the Santa 
Monica Freeway had on our daily lives following the Jan. 17 earthquake. Had 
this freeway and others been retrofitted for earthquake safety, it is very 
likely the damage and resulting closure could have been avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 1A on the upcoming June 7 ballot gives us all a chance to help 
minimize the risk of this happening again. Proposition 1A will ask voters to 
approve $2 billion in general-obligation bonds to help victims of the quake and 
make safety improvements to public buildings and state highways. Nearly half of 
the money, $950 million, will help make more highway bridges, including toll 
bridges, earthquake safe. 
</P>
<P>
 We need Proposition 1A to protect ourselves from future disasters. With it, we 
can accelerate and expand the retrofit program without diverting resources from 
other critical projects. Without it, vital safety work may be further 
postponed; or the transportation improvements promised by Proposition 111 -- a 
voter-approved measure that increased gasoline tax -- may be delayed so that 
seismic safety work can be done. 
</P>
<P>
 As both a resident and employer on the Westside, I urge voters to join me in 
supporting Proposition 1A come June 7. We need to act now to ensure the safety 
of our highways and lives -- tomorrow may be too late!

ART: RESPECT FOR WORKS FROM HAITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I appreciate the respect and interest the Los Angeles Times has for art and 
culture. Suzanne Muchnic and Christopher Knight display the utmost of 
professionalism when writing about art. This is why I want to take the 
opportunity to respond to a recent article by Carol Chastang, "Haitian Art 
Finds a Home at Galerie Lakaye," (May 19). 
</P>
<P>
 Even if this article is a profile on one gallery, it does not have to be at 
the expense of Haitian art. Haitian art warrants more respect and substance. 
</P>
<P>
 First concerning the title, Haitian art is not homeless and has been on the 
international market for the last 50 years. Prestigious public and private 
collections reside throughout the United States and Europe. New York's Museum 
of Modern Art is among one of many museums with Haitian art in their permanent 
collections. Major auction houses such as Christie's and Sotheby's have 
represented Haitian art on their blocks for the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitian art galleries and dealers throughout the world would be extremely 
offended to read that for the last 25 to 30 years they "just try to peddle the 
art." Here on the West Coast, and in particular Los Angeles, the exposure to 
Haitian art is minimal. It is crucial when articles are written that they are 
correct and fully researched. 
</P>
<P>
 The Galerie Lakaye is not a true gallery. One could call it a boutique where 
people enjoy hanging out because of the ambience, where people can buy posters, 
handicrafts, occasionally lingerie, children's clothing, jewelry, dishes and 
T-shirts. Whatever to make a buck. Occasionally, the Galerie Lakaye will 
organize a real exhibition with an artist such as Phillippe Dodard. These 
exhibitions are too rare for this boutique to earn the label gallery. Another 
thing: The words "Galerie" and "Lakaye" don't exist in Haitian Creole. "Gallery 
from back home" would be "Galeri Lakay." Haitian art, Haitian culture and 
Haitian Creole deserve more respect.

BRINGING THE KIDS? TRY RENTING A HOME AWAY FROM HOME; IN CALIFORNIA, USING A 
CHILD-FRIENDLY COTTAGE AS A BASE FOR EXPLORING THE ROMANTIC MENDOCINO COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe it was the call of the Great Unknown, although it could have been that 
second glass of Cabernet at cocktail hour. When old friends suggested a 
two-family getaway to the romantic Mendocino coast, we leaped at the idea. We 
could picture it all -- the bluffs, the vineyards, the quaint little country 
inns. So breathtaking was the notion that we all completely forgot . . . We 
can't go to a place like Mendocino! WE HAVE KIDS!!!  
</P>
<P>
 Don't misunderstand. Parenthood is its own, er, reward. But there are 
trade-offs, and one is summed up in that old oxymoron, family vacation. 
Generally speaking, anything that looks like a totally excellent adventure to 
your children will leave you counting the minutes until you can get back to 
your relaxing job. And any place where words like "romantic" and "getaway" come 
into play is going to be a land bereft of Nintendo. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, by the time this occurred to us, the commitment was made and our 
curiosity was piqued: Was there an uncharted middle ground between Camp Snoopy 
and Carmel? 
</P>
<P>
 And so we set off -- me, my husband, Bob, our 2-year-old and 11-year-old 
daughters, our friends Andy Furillo and Deb Anderluh and 3-year-old Andy Jr. -- 
two carloads of moms, dads and kids hellbent for the couples capital of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Up, up we went in our family-sized wagons into the gingerbread clap board 
belly of the beast. And now that our vacation's over, we offer this conclusion: 
You can take your kids to places like Mendocino and have great fun, but it's 
not the kind of fun these places are famous for. 
</P>
<P>
 Take accommodations. Full-color volumes have been written about the 
bed-and-breakfasts of Mendocino -- inn after trellised Victorian inn, where 
fine-crafted antiques vie with contemporary art for the privilege of being 
trashed by your 2-year-old. We really couldn't blame the nice lady at the 
Glendeven Inn and Gallery who told us that at the moment, they lacked an 
"appropriate" room, but that with a little more notice they could have given us 
the (renovated) barn. 
</P>
<P>
 After six or seven such conversations -- all involving heavy use of that word 
"appropriate" -- our friend Deb had a brainstorm and phoned a place called 
Pacific Resorts in Little River. The firm is one of three in the Mendocino area 
that broker the use of vacation and retirement homes, by the night or by the 
week. Prices range from $75 to $400 per night, depending on the size and 
location of the house. Most have ocean views, fireplaces, linens, fully 
equipped kitchens and other amenities of the sort you'd expect at a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 For $150 a night, we got three nights in a bright, squeaky clean, two-bedroom, 
two-bathroom cabin. It was five minutes south of downtown Mendocino, surrounded 
by redwoods and meadows, safely across a two-lane blacktop from the 
picturesque-but-deadly-to-toddlers ocean cliffs. Amenities included a hot tub, 
a glass-doored sauna that looked out into the woods, two TVs, a VCR, a stereo 
with a CD player, a microwave, shelves full of games and books (including 
children's books), a wood-burning stove and skylights in just about every room. 
</P>
<P>
 Our friends and their toddler took one bedroom; we shared the other with our 
2-year-old, Gina. Our 11-year-old, Alex, set up camp in the living room on an 
exceptionally comfy fold-out couch. We noted with relief that the wood 
furniture was virtually unbreakable, with no sharp corners or light-colored 
upholstery. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost -- including a 10% county bed tax and cleaning fee -- came to about 
$92 per family per night. It was about half of what we would have had to spend 
for two rooms at a bed and breakfast in the area -- even if no priceless 
heirlooms were destroyed.  
</P>
<P>
 Mendocino -- with its Victori an clapboard houses, its tumbling wildflower 
gardens, its crashing surf, its bookstores and bakeries -- was as picturesque 
as anyone could ask; Alex was particularly impressed by a quaint little sign 
pointing to the town video arcade. 
</P>
<P>
 We took a short walk along the bluffs by the ocean. That too would have been 
fetching, except that there are -- gulp -- no guardrails at the tops of those 
breathtaking 50- and 60-foot cliffs. Taking in the scenery can be a real 
challenge when your kids keep trying to lean over jagged precipices that, 
according to the guidebooks, are dotted with poison oak. The up-side, however, 
was in appreciating the landscape through a kid's eyes and ears -- the ornate 
carving in the totem poles near the shore, the muscular flight of the gulls, 
the way the croaking of the frogs seemed to come from everywhere at once. 
</P>
<P>
 We also noted that bringing kids onto couples' vacation turf was forcing us to 
interact more with the townies than tourists otherwise might. Other visitors 
wanted strolling violin players and candle-lit tables for two. We wanted 
eight-packs of hot dogs and Blockbuster Video.  
</P>
<P>
 On the streets, couples glared with the well-founded suspicion that we were 
justthisclose to wrecking the choreography of their romance. But the one local 
family we spotted that first night -- two women and a 5-year-old girl -- was 
exceptionally friendly, not to mention colorful. 
</P>
<P>
 They were easy to pick out -- they were the only other people on the street 
that night with a child, they sported a Little River bumper sticker on their 
car, they were clad in black leather jackets and steel-toed boots and one of 
the women had pink hair. The effect was daunting, but they seemed to know their 
way around. And when we stopped them to ask directions to a supermarket and 
video store they turned out to be friendly and welcoming.  
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of our second day, we rose early, brewed a pot of strong coffee 
and set out on a two-hour boat ride. We had been drawn to the idea because, at 
the time of our visit, it was spring and whale-watching season, but the boat 
owner -- Anchor Charters in Fort Bragg, 10 miles north of Mendocino -- also 
runs a popular summertime cruise along the coast, up the Noyo River and back. 
</P>
<P>
 Whale-watching rates were $20 per person, with children under 4 traveling free 
(depending on space availability). The summer excursion fares are cheaper at 
$10 per adult and, with most of the trip on a river, probably more fun for 
kids. Our outing, as it turned out, was a bust -- the air was bone-chilling, 
the ocean was choppy and, as Andy Sr. later put it, "the only spouting we saw 
was over the side of the boat." 
</P>
<P>
 "We shoulda taken the Skunk Train," sighed one passenger, referring to a local 
attraction that we also missed -- a scenic redwood tour that the California 
Western Railroad runs by steam train out of Fort Bragg. Fares for that 
excursion, which follows an old logging line, are $26 full day, $21 half day 
for adults and $12 full day, $10 half day for children age 5-11, with lap 
babies riding for free. 
</P>
<P>
 We got back to port at about 1 p.m., and drove back into Mendocino for some 
window shopping and lunch. Our friends got take-out pizza at a gourmet shop 
called Tote Fete on Lansing Street, where entrees ranged from apricot chicken 
salad to hearty calzones , and discovered a terrific children's store called 
Out of This World that featured telescopes, solar system paraphernalia and 
other science-oriented toys for kids. 
</P>
<P>
 We, meanwhile, went all-out and headed for the historic Mendocino Hotel, a 
plush, turn-of-the-century establishment that was built in 1878 and restored to 
its original grandeur in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel restaurant had gotten good reviews. But, like so many places in 
Mendocino, the service was decidedly awkward when it came to kids. The maitre 
d' took one look at us and ushered us to the furthest corner of the garden 
room. There, despite generations of technological progress, they still hadn't 
managed to acquire booster seats. (We were later told that the hotel does have 
highchairs, but no one was offering them to us that day.) 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, we browsed in an eclectic sportswear shop until little Gina could 
no longer contain herself and began tearing in and out of clothing racks. Then 
it was off to Van Damme State Park, three miles to the south, where a 
twentysomething park ranger informed us that the Fern Canyon Discovery Trail 
across the road from the ocean was "killer." 
</P>
<P>
 It was, in fact, a gorgeous and very kid-friendly hike, on a wide trail that 
followed a burbling brook up verdant Fern Canyon. Van Damme State Park clearly 
was the big draw for tourists with families -- the park's 74 family campsites 
were packed with tents and recreational vehicles and kids on skateboards and 
bikes. (For those who like to rough it, there are also 10 hike-in campsites in 
a dewy patch of coastal forest about two miles up a scenic trail; rangers told 
us that reservations for any of the campgrounds are essential during the peak 
summer months.) 
</P>
<P>
 Had the little kids been older and hardier, we might have followed the trail 
for its full, seven-mile loop through the redwoods to the park's signature 
destination -- the Pygmy Forest -- and back. An ecological oddity, the Pygmy 
Forest is a sort of bonsai wilderness of small, gnarled, lichen-encrusted trees 
whose trunks are less than an inch in diameter; some species are said to be 
found nowhere else in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the three-mile section of the trail we took was a scenic mother 
lode. Redwoods towered overhead. Huge ferns spilled in every direction. The 
path was spongy with pine needles and edged with clover. Little Andy Jr. found 
a three-inch-long green slug and touched it with his chubby hand. Alex 
pronounced the hike "a 10." Gina darted in and out of foliage with her fingers 
spread like claws, pretending to be a dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was Happy Hour, and we returned to the cabin for grown-up glasses of 
Boont Amber Ale and Husch Cabernet, both local brews. The toddlers got their 
first dip in a hot tub, squealing "Bubbles!"; Alex held her nose and went under 
like a scuba diver.

 We realized that we had no dinner reservations, and it was Saturday night in 
Mendocino, so we stayed home and barbecued. It was, we later felt, the most 
delicious repast of the trip: Italian sausages, turkey hot dogs, pasta with 
garlic and olive oil, grilled fresh vegetables and ice cream for dessert. As we 
talked into the night over bottles of wine, the little kids fell asleep in 
front of a dinosaur video and Alex stayed up late for "Saturday Night Live." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Our last day featured some of the best and worst moments of the trip. There 
was a breathtaking hike through the Hendy Woods State Park, a half-hour's drive 
inland in the Anderson Valley, where stands of old-growth redwood and Douglas 
fir line the pebbly banks of the Navarro River. There, in the brisk sunshine, 
we waded and picnicked and skipped rocks and drowsed with only the birds and 
the tadpoles for company. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the lilt on our car radios of bossa nova music from the very good 
public radio station that broadcast, to our surprise, from the tiny Anderson 
Valley hamlet of Philo, and the taste of the pinot noir at the Husch vineyard, 
where we stopped to buy a case of wine. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was also the one sour note of our trip -- a meal at the renowned 
Cafe Beaujolais, a place where we should have taken one look and said, "We'll 
just get our nouvelle cuisine to go. " 
</P>
<P>
 Why we tried to take two toddlers into a fancy restaurant with little 
trellises on the front porch still isn't entirely clear. Maybe we were blinded 
by the good luck we had had so far. Maybe it was that our kids had been pretty 
well-behaved in restaurants before. Maybe it was that the place looked like 
somebody's grandma's house. 
</P>
<P>
 But as we trooped past the formal china and the heavy cutlery with our extra 
Pampers and sticky hands, it soon became clear that we would be lucky if ol' 
grandma didn't give us the boot. Brandishing the menus, our hostess smiled 
sweetly at Andy Jr. and hissed: "You'd better be a good boy or you can't stay 
in the restaurant." Then we were ushered onto -- what else? -- the back porch, 
where a table for seven had been set up without a highchair or booster seat in 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Three couples looked at us, then meaningfully at each other. The place was as 
hushed as a confessional. Andy Jr. took one look at the wrought iron grown-up 
chair where he was supposed to sit with the self-control of a child four times 
his age and emitted a shriek that pierced the bucolic room like a smoke alarm. 
On cue, Baby Gina snatched a wine goblet from her place setting, shouted, "Gina 
drink wine!" and slithered under the table in her little princess dress. 
</P>
<P>
 Need I say more? It wasn't a pretty sight. We hustled the kids out as fast as 
we could and bolted our food in shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 We'd been having so much fun, we completely forgot. . . . We can't go to a 
place like Mendocino! WE HAVE KIDS!!! GUIDEBOOK

BRINGING THE KIDS? TRY RENTING A HOME AWAY FROM HOME; IN FRANCE, HUNTING FOR 
SNAILS AND MAKING NEW FRIENDS FROM A 15TH-CENTURY FARMHOUSE IN PROVENCE

 "What's Jacqueline doing?" 
</P>
<P>
 While we were waiting for the baby to wake from a morning nap, my 4-year-old 
was leaning out the kitchen window of our 15th-Century Provence farmhouse, 
keeping an eye on both a departing thunderstorm and the neighbors next door. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbor Jacqueline Portay, decked out in rubber boots that would have made 
L.L. Bean proud, was wandering about under a towering stand of linden trees, 
occasionally bending over and dropping something into a bucket. 
</P>
<P>
 We headed outside to find out what was up. Escargots , she said, letting us 
peer into her pail. And so began our great snail hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Last May, other tourists in southern France may have been having the kind of 
adventures that involved Cannes, the five-star Carlton Hotel and the glamorous 
likes of Mel Gibson. My family was hunting snails, exclaiming over the deep-sea 
edibles for sale on the Marseilles waterfront ("Mom! An octopus!") and queuing 
up at the bakery with the working crowd for fresh-from-the-oven baguettes. 
</P>
<P>
 We were in France. With the kids. And we were having a grand time. The key, as 
we have proved to ourselves numerous times since having our first child five 
years ago, is renting a house. 
</P>
<P>
 In our pre-child days, my husband and I loved racing from fancy hotel to 
quaint bed and breakfast to mountaintop inn. Inevitably, we would visit some 
little town that would cause us to say, "Wouldn't it be fun to spend a month 
here?" We never did. 
</P>
<P>
 Then along came Ryan. We were determined not to give up traveling, but we 
couldn't imagine lugging around all that baby equipment. So we set about 
finding a cocoon where, after each long day of sightseeing, we could retreat to 
the serenity of a crib already set up, baby formula in the refrigerator and a 
washer-dryer awaiting the day's spills. The hoped-for bonus: A glimpse of what 
it was like to live in a foreign country. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ryan was 7 months old we rented a house for a month in 
Tourrettes-sur-Loup, a medieval village perched on a mountain high above the 
glittering Riviera about a 20-minute drive northwest of Nice. On our first day 
we parked in the town square, and, as our rental agency had promised, found our 
house just yards away from the square's bakery, butcher and other food shops. A 
few steps in the other direction led to the Grande-Rue, a cobblestone street 
too narrow for cars, where several dozen artists living above their 
workshops-studios have turned the town into an arts-and-crafts center. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-bedroom, two-bath house, owned by a retired couple from Boston who 
dabble in antiques, was lovingly furnished with finds from the weekly Nice flea 
market. Unexpected pleasures included an antique highchair; bookshelves stacked 
with juicy novels (in English and French); a stereo cassette player with plenty 
of tapes. The third-floor terrace, just big enough for a few lounge chairs and 
a dining table, looked out over tile rooftops and tall cypress trees to the 
distant Mediterranean. We felt completely at home. 
</P>
<P>
 On day trips we explored the Picasso Museum at Antibes, the waterfront 
promenade in Nice and the glamorous shops of Monaco -- all within a half-hour's 
drive.  
</P>
<P>
 But often, we just lounged around our terrace, took walks into the valley, 
picnicked on the mountain or devoured fresh strawberry crepes at the local 
creperie. With the help of my high school-college French (and our home's 
friendly, English-speaking caretakers), we picked up on the village gossip: why 
the two bickering sisters shut down the grocery on the corner, which man had 
bought up all the real estate in town, why the nickname for our favorite baker 
was Madame Overcharge. 
</P>
<P>
 At night, when Ryan was tucked away, we'd dine on pate, sausages, cheese, 
bread and wine. Sometimes we'd buy one of the chickens the butcher roasted in 
the square. We'd get take-out artichoke and Nicoise olive pizza. Or we'd boil 
some gourmet ravioli packed with wild mushrooms or smoked salmon. France is a 
take-out paradise. Our caretakers, who run a clothing store on Tourrettes' 
Grande-Rue, had two teen-agers who baby-sat when we went out to dinner. And our 
electronic baby monitor even reached across our narrow cobble-stone street into 
Chez Grandmere, a French and North African restaurant to whose couscous I 
became addicted.  
</P>
<P>
 The French, we found happily, love children, especially babies. Ryan was the 
catalyst for more conversations with natives than I've ever had on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourrettes shop owners would scold us for not putting socks on him during our 
morning runs for croissants. Waiters would carry him around. Fellow diners 
would spirit him away to their own tables and coo over him tirelessly ( Il est 
magnifique , one woman pronounced firmly, smooching him goodby on both cheeks). 
</P>
<P>
 Because the family-oriented French expect kids to be a part of life, we 
brought Ryan to lunch at the kinds of restaurants we'd never dream of taking 
him to in America. At the Colombe D'Or in Saint-Paul de Vence, an expensive 
celebrity haven where Roger Moore was dining on the terrace a few tables away, 
they didn't bat an eye when we wheeled in a stroller. In fact, they switched 
our reserved table to one with more room on the side for Ryan to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunching the French way -- long, hearty and on an outdoor terrace -- was 
perfect for a 7-month-old (who didn't learn to crawl until one memorable day in 
St. Tropez). While we ate course after course, the baby played happily around 
the table, just like the dogs that the French assume are welcome everywhere.  
</P>
<P>
 In the next few years, we rented a house in the Austrian Alps, a condo in 
Santa Fe and a house in Tucson, all with great success. But last year when baby 
Caitlin came along, we returned to France. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, we found a farmhouse deep in the heart of Provence, about a 
half-mile from L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue. This picturesque town, built on a series 
of canals, is the gateway to the Luberon hills and the villages made famous by 
Peter Mayle's books, "A Year in Provence" and "Toujours Provence." With two 
kids, we wanted to be no more than an hour's traveling time from such 
attractions as Avignon, Aix-en-Provence and Arles. 
</P>
<P>
 Our stuccoed, three-bedroom farmhouse, whose large, airy rooms were filled 
with comfy antiques, was the secondary residence on a once-glamorous estate 
called the Domaine de Palerme. The main house next door was occupied by 
Jacqueline Portay and her husband, Pierre. Pierre is a dentist and Jacqueline 
works in the Avignon tourist office. But they also oversee the tourist tenants 
and farm the estate, planting fields of sunflowers to sell for oil and lavender 
to sell for perfume. 
</P>
<P>
 We did visit the traditional highlights of Provence, from the mountaintop 
ruins of Les Baux to the seaside beauty of Cassis. But we had some highlights 
all our own. Baby Caitlin was as popular as Baby Ryan had been. And Ryan, at 4, 
sparked new adventures. 
</P>
<P>
 When he wanted to play and there were no kids around, we'd produce our soccer 
ball. Voila : Out would come the children, eager to coach an American kid in 
their favorite sport. Ryan, who had been blase about watching the 
French-language videotapes I'd bought for him at home, suddenly got religion. 
He'd race over to me, saying, "Quick, Mom! Tell me some French!" He learned not 
only that it wasn't so easy, but that you picked it up by listening. Allez-y! a 
boy would call, sending the ball Ryan's way, meaning, "Your turn, go ahead." 
Pretty soon Ryan learned to say it back. 
</P>
<P>
 We became regulars at what we called the Hat Cafe in L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, 
which we nicknamed because the sidewalk umbrellas were in the shape of straw 
hats. Our favorite waitress would festoon Ryan's dishes of ice cream with toy 
favors that are usually one-to-a-customer. The cafe employees provided us with 
sightseeing and shopping advice and, eventually, baby-sitters. 
</P>
<P>
 One of our greatest pleasures was shopping -- not only in the small food shops 
where tourists occasionally venture, but in the supermarkets where they almost 
never set foot. The cheese-counter ladies were delighted to educate us in the 
differences among the 20 locally produced goat cheeses. We took satisfaction in 
learning to negotiate the fresh-produce section, where machines automatically 
weighed and priced delectable asparagus and delicate baby lettuces. After a 
while, it did feel, just a little, like we actually lived there. 
</P>
<P>
 Since we had our own kitchen, we could cater to Ryan's picky food tastes -- 
not to mention save money by taking picnics on day trips. Pizza, however, is 
ubiquitous in France, and cafe menus usually offer hamburgers or plain, 
kid-friendly dishes such as roast chicken and French fries. McDonald's 
knock-offs are common too. Much to our surprise, however, Ryan took a shine to 
all kinds of goat cheeses.  
</P>
<P>
 Every supermarket has shelves of baby food: Along with the ordinary stuff, 
Gerber and Nestle produce pureed artichokes and a wide variety of tropical 
fruits for the French market. And disposable diapers (Pampers is the big name) 
have become a way of life for French parents too. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday mornings, L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue hosts one of the best markets in 
Provence, a bonanza of food and antiques booths that line the narrow streets. 
Each week, we would spread out over the market, buying olives, strawberries, 
breads and sausages (our favorite was a pistachio-studded version, but the 
donkey sausage from Arles was pretty good too). We'd head back to the 
farmhouse, spread the back-yard table with a Provencal tablecloth and feast all 
afternoon in the sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was the snail hunt. At first, Ryan was appalled at the thought 
of touching the slimy creatures. But, coaxed in a mixture of French and English 
by Jacqueline, he was soon racing around the fields of emerging sunflower 
plants hunting up the little beasts as gleefully as if they were Easter eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 When we had filled two huge buckets, we carried them back to Jacqueline's 
house, where she dumped them into boxes of flour. After the snails had binged 
and purged on flour for several days, they were ready to cook. On our last day 
in Provence, she made us a sumptuous snail stew. 
</P>
<P>
 True, there are trade-offs to traveling with kids that even the comforts of a 
home away from home can't eliminate. You can't spend hours wandering through 
museums, people-watching over cappuccino or poking into boutiques. Kids' 
interests and attention spans tend to rule the day. As do their basic needs: 
One day in Monaco, my friend went into the Hermes store to shop . . . and I 
went across the street to change a diaper in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 But I wouldn't have missed that snail hunt for the world. Not even for Mel 
Gibson.

TRAVEL INSIDER: ANOTHER MEANING FOR ATM: AIRLINE TICKETING MACHINE; TREND: 
ABOUT 200 MACHINES ARE IN U.S. AIRPORTS, HOTELS AND RETAIL SHOPPING CENTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS, TIMES TRAVEL WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 For most of us, buying an airline ticket is still a matter of making a phone 
call, reciting credit card numbers and waiting for mail carriers to deliver our 
tickets, or perhaps driving to an airline office to pick them up ourselves. But 
a handful of companies are now vying to give air travelers a shortcut -- via a 
network of remote airline ticketing machines. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of these travelers, many of them in Southern California, are still 
buying their tickets by calling and booking through a travel agent or an 
airline. But once the tickets are ordered, instead of waiting for the mail or 
fighting traffic to reach an airline's branch office, the consumers make their 
way to a more convenient retail site, hotel or airport and pluck up their 
ticket from an attendant operating a machine similar to an automated teller. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, most of the ticketing sites are scattered in about 200 locations 
around the Western United States in airports, hotels and commercial centers, 
and fewer than one in six U.S. travel agencies (depending on the computerized 
reservation systems they use) is capable of delivering tickets this way. But 
two companies are serving the public with attended machines, and Tom Mistrot, 
manager of electronic ticket delivery networks for Airlines Reporting Corp., 
predicts that networks like these "will ultimately be a primary, if not the 
primary, way of delivering tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who could benefit most from the innovation: travelers who fly on 
short notice and make frequent ticketing changes; travelers who use out-of-town 
or across-town travel agents and travelers who book flights with airlines via 
home computer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both Mail Boxes Etc. and QDAT Corp. of Scottsdale, Ariz., have been accredited 
to sell tickets via electronic networks by the Airlines Reporting Corp., which 
represents more than 140 airlines in the printing and distribution of tickets. 
Officials of Airlines Reporting Corp. say three other firms have been 
accredited but are not yet selling tickets: Travel Teller International of 
Dublin, Ohio; Electronic Data Systems of Dallas, and Sabre, the Dallas-based 
computer reservation system owned by the parent company of American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Mail Boxes Etc. and QDAT make their money by signing up airlines and travel 
agents and charging them annual fees and transaction fees (Mail Boxes Etc. 
charges $7 for a booking; QDAT, $8.95.) Danoff estimates that half the 
participating agencies and airlines have chosen to absorb the fees, rather than 
pass them on to consumers. In transactions with an agency or airline that is 
passing the cost along, he said, the fee should show up as a separate line on 
your credit card billing. 
</P>
<P>
 QDAT, which says it has signed on several hundred travel agencies nationwide, 
so far has been concentrating on putting ticketing sites in airports and 
hotels, while Mail Boxes Etc. is sticking to its own franchised outlets in 
retail shopping areas. (The stores, roughly 2,400 nationwide, specialize in 
handling package mail, faxes and other communications.) 
</P>
<P>
 Mail Boxes Etc. started testing a system called MinuteMail TicketNet last July 
at 150 Mail Boxes Etc. outlets in Los Angeles and Orange counties. The 
six-month pilot project was confined to tickets from three airlines (United, 
American and USAir) booked via a handful of L.A.-area travel agencies and sold 
"a few thousand tickets," says William Lange, the firm's vice president for 
business development.  
</P>
<P>
 But early this year, the firm widened the project. Lange said the Mail Boxes 
Etc. network now includes roughly 100 travel agencies and all major airlines 
(except Southwest). It also started expanding into new cities, adding San 
Francisco, Denver and Chicago in February and March, pushing the total number 
of outlets to about 200. This month, the firm plans to add New York, 
Washington, D.C. and Boston. By the end of 1994, says Lange, Mail Boxes Etc.'s 
target is to have 1,000 outlets outfitted for ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
 To get their tickets, travelers right now must book their flight by phone with 
an airline or a travel agent who pays a sign-up fee to QDAT or Mail Boxes Etc. 
and uses the computerized reservation system known as System One. System One, 
used by about 16% of the roughly 32,000 computerized travel agencies in the 
United States, includes all major airlines except Southwest (which is embroiled 
in a dispute with computer reservation system operators over fees). 
</P>
<P>
 The other major player in the airline ticket printer business at the moment is 
QDAT Corp. of Scottsdale, Ariz. Robert Danoff, the company's vice president for 
marketing, reports that QDAT (which stands for Quick Delivery Airline Tickets) 
has placed about 150 attended "QuickTix" machines nationwide, including about 
40 at 23 of the busiest airports in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, the ticketing sites are placed near airport fax and copy machines 
and other business services. At LAX, the machines can be found in 
departure-level areas of Terminal 1 (near Gate 5), Terminal 4 (near Gate 41) 
and Terminal 7 (near gates 72-77); each is open 6 a.m.-10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 QDAT has placed another roughly 100 ticket machines in upscale, 
business-oriented U.S. hotels (in Beverly Hills at the Four Seasons and the 
Nikko, for instance). For now, each airport and hotel printer is overseen by 
someone trained in its operation (either an attendant or a hotel employee), 
though Danoff foresees the arrival of unattended ticketing machines this fall 
in some major office buildings.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; CAR RENTALS FOR FREE SPIRITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many savvy travelers bound for foreign shores line up their rental cars before 
they leave home, a tactic that usually results in considerable savings but 
requires some planning ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Kemwel, a company based in Harrison, N.Y., that offers international car 
rentals and European car leases among other travel services, has a service for 
the free spirits among us. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemwel's new CarPass Plan enables travelers to prepay for their car rentals in 
U.S. dollars but choose their rental dates after they arrive at their 
destinations. This provides the flexibility of renting on the spot while saving 
20% to 50% off local rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Each CarPass is valid for three consecutive days in six countries. Unused 
passes are fully refundable upon return to the United States. Travelers may buy 
as many passes as they want. They may be redeemed through March 31, 1995, based 
on availability. For information, call Kemwel at (800) 678-0678.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; WHEN IN ROME, NO SUMMER OPERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rome's summer opera season has been canceled because of a lack of funds. 
Spokesman Maurizio Venafro told Reuters news service that Rome's Teatro 
dell'Opera was struggling with a $33-million deficit and could not afford to 
stage the shows.He said it was the first time since the end of World War II the 
season had been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 The cancellation was the second blow to Roman opera after the closure earlier 
this spring of the ancient Baths of Caracalla, which had been the home of 
summer open-air opera since 1938. 
</P>
<P>
 Heritage Minister Alberto Ronchey said vibrations, heavy equipment and the 
170,000 tourists who flocked to the concerts were destroying the site, begun 
under Emperor Antonius Caracalla and opened in 217 AD.

GEAR & GADGETS; KEEPING A CAMERA DRY ON THE WETTEST TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDI DASH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Summer trips invariably entail some contact with water. Whether swimming, 
boating, hiking on a drizzly day or just lounging at the beach, you'll probably 
face the challenge of keeping what's wet away from what's meant to stay dry. 
I've found the following items to be invaluable on land and water. Prices do 
not include shipping or handling. 
</P>
<P>
 As a professional photographer, I don't go anywhere without big self-sealing 
plastic bags to protect my camera, lenses and film in potentially wet 
conditions. But on outdoor adventure trips, the plastic bags can tear easily 
and they do nothing to cushion my equipment against hard knocks. Happily, 
Tenba, a manufacturer of high-quality camera bags, recently developed the 
Voyageur's Aqua System 1, which consists of a large (about 18 inches square) 
inflatable waterproof nylon flotation outer bag and a removable padded and 
zippered inner "shore" bag. The shore bag, which measures 12 inches by 15 
inches by 4 inches and has adjustable dividers, is large enough to hold a 
standard-size SLR camera, a flash, two or three extra lenses, a few rolls of 
film and spare batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 The outer bag inflates via a nozzle inside the bag and has a watertight 
sealing rod for quick opening and closing -- a boon during boating excursions. 
The nylon material is lighter and more durable than the rubber used for most 
other waterproof inflatable bags on the market. A wide adjustable shoulder 
strap attaches with strap hooks to either the flotation bag or the shore bag. 
</P>
<P>
 I tried out the Aqua System during two rainy weeks of hiking in Malaysia, and 
everything came through high and dry. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenba also makes a small (7 inches by 6 inches by 8 inches) inflatable 
waterproof bag, the Aqua Pal, which is good for carrying around a small 
point-and-shoot camera, a portable cassette player or personal items. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenba Aqua System 1, with canary yellow waterproof outer bag and gray shore 
bag lists for $100; the Aqua Pal lists for $40. Both are available for 
substantially lower prices at discount camera stores. For a store near you, 
contact the manufacturer at (212) 966-1013.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Sometimes a bag has to do double duty carrying both wet and dry items, which 
is often the case when swimming is on the agenda. That's where the Wet 'n' Dry 
sports bag from Sport Suits of Australia (SSA), an Australian manufacturer of 
water sportswear, comes in handy. The bag has a large mesh pocket on one side 
to stash wet beach gear and a large plastic-coated water-resistant nylon pocket 
on the other to protect dry stuff. Inside there are plastic pockets for 
organizing smaller items, such as tubes of suntan lotion, sunglasses or keys. 
The bag comes in two sizes: medium (12 inches by 24 inches by 8 inches) and 
large (14 inches by 26 inches by 10 inches). The larger bag has extra plastic 
pockets for organizing small items. 
</P>
<P>
 SSA Wet 'n' Dry sports bags in red or blue are $30 (medium size), $40 (large). 
For a store near you, write SSA at 7625 Havenhurst Ave., Unit 35, Van Nuys, 
Calif. 91406; or call (818) 376-0402.

 When Cleveland's new baseball stadium opened in April, I headed to the 
Indians' opening day exhibition game armed with two precautionary staples: my 
trusty umbrella and my self-inflating Insul-a-Seat. The former is essential for 
dealing with fickle spring weather; the latter is the best defense I know 
against a sore back and derriere from sitting against hard -- and sometimes wet 
-- surfaces for long periods of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Made of the same open-cell foam material used in self-inflating camping 
mattresses, the Insul-a-Seat's backrest and seat cushion have adjustable straps 
at top and bottom that clip together to create a chair effect, with good back 
support thanks to internal stays. The twist of a nozzle starts the inflating 
process, and the chair can be deflated easily by tightly rolling up the 
material with the nozzle open, then closing the nozzle to keep air from coming 
back in. The outer material is water-repellent, so it makes a great shield 
against wet and/or dirty surfaces -- a blessing when canoeing or picnicking on 
the grass.  
</P>
<P>
 The Insul-a-Seat comes in four lengths; the two largest sizes can be used as 
camping mattresses when the straps are released. The seat comes with a stuff 
sack, and is available in five colors: royal blue, ice blue, turquoise and 
olive green. 
</P>
<P>
 Insul-a-Seat comes in four sizes: 33 inches by 15 1/2 inches ($36), 36 inches 
by 18 inches ($40), 48 inches by 18 inches ($50), and 72 inches by 20 inches 
($80). For a store near you contact the distributor, Slumberjack, at (800) 
233-6283.  
</P>

 I've devised all sorts of ways to keep matches dry when camping or boating -- 
plastic bags, plastic film canisters -- but they somehow get damp anyway, often 
leaving me without a flame when I need one. As for lighters, they don't stand 
up well to wind, and I worry about the fluid leaking. Who better to come up 
with a solution than Orvis, the fly-fishing-rod manufacturers? 
</P>
<P>
 The company's waterproof lighter is housed in an aluminum case with an O-ring 
seal around the flip-back lid, which locks snugly into place. A small raised 
section shields the flame against wind. The lighter, which measures just 3 
inches by 1 1/2 inches by 1/2 inch, is refillable and has a metal ring for 
attaching to a key chain or belt hook. I've dropped this lighter into a river, 
left it out in the rain, and tested it on a sailboat in full wind conditions; 
it lit every time. And it never leaked.  
</P>
<P>
 Waterproof Lighter (J1237-09) is $45 from Orvis; tel. (800) 548-9548.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Extra soap often comes in handy when traveling, but when I'm moving around a 
lot, the soap bar never seems to dry in time for packing up, which means I end 
up leaving it behind or risking a gooey mess in the toilet bag. These 
individual soap wafers are an innovative solution. The thin "sheets" of soap 
come 100 per 3-inch by 4-inch zip-lock plastic pouch. Just remove one of the 
wafers, put it in the palm of your hand, add water and rub your hands together 
for one lather. The rest of the soap wafers stay dry until you need them. 
</P>
<P>
 Soap Wafers (item KR502) are $3.95 per 100-count package from Magellan's; tel. 
(800) 962-4943. Gear & Gadgets appears the first week of every month.

CRUISE VIEWS: OVER LAND AND SEA TO ALASKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not many cruise ships call in Chicken, a tiny landlocked hamlet on a bumpy, 
unpaved road in northeastern Alaska about 250 miles from the nearest navigable 
water as the crow flies. But Alaska Highway Cruises does. 
</P>
<P>
 This new Seattle-based company has come up with such a fresh but obvious idea, 
it's a wonder nobody did it before. The packages combine a Holland America Line 
Alaska cruise with an Alaska overland journey in a recreational vehicle. The 
RVs can be picked up in Washington or Canada for the trip to Alaska and turned 
in at the port for a cruise back. You can also reverse the trip and begin with 
the cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 One itinerary, the Glacier Route, sails between Vancouver, B.C., and Seward, 
Alaska, calling at Ketchikan, Juneau, Sitka and Valdez. Passengers sail aboard 
the Noordam or Nieuw Amsterdam, and may choose between a seven-night drive from 
Seward to Anchorage that includes visits to Denali National Park and Fairbanks, 
or a 14-night overland excursion between Seward and Vancouver via the Alaska 
Highway with an option to detour up to the Klondike or cross the scenic Cassiar 
Highway into the Yukon's remote Kluane National Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers can opt to take either the cruise or the land portion first, but we 
would suggest getting the more strenuous land adventure over first, then 
settling into the lap of luxury on a cruise back. 
</P>
<P>
 Alaska Highway Cruises provides 1994-model RVs that sleep two to six, along 
with a book of coupon vouchers for reserved campground spaces every night; 
passengers buy their own gasoline and food. 
</P>
<P>
 For our 3,100-mile journey, we spent roughly $600 on gas and oil and $400 on 
food and beverages on an accelerated nine-night version of the 14-night 
itinerary along the Alaska and Klondike Highways. We did not take the cruise 
portion. 
</P>
<P>
 We started our trip in Seattle where an AHC representative met us at the 
airport and drove us to Anacortes, where the RVs for northbound travelers are 
parked in an attractive, wooded private campground called Scimitar Ridge. After 
learning how to handle the vehicle, program participants usually spend their 
first night here with vouchers for dinner and breakfast at a nearby restaurant, 
then set out for Kamloops, British Columbia, along the dramatic Coquihalla 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 By getting up and out early every morning, we spotted a fair amount of 
wildlife along the roadsides -- moose, caribou, white-tail deer, black bear, a 
lone wolf, snowshoe hares, porcupines, great blue heron, geese and bald eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 We tried to reach our destination for the night by mid-afternoon, but found it 
hard to go to sleep at 10 or 11 at night when the sun was still shining. 
</P>
<P>
 For two people, the standard issue is a 1994-model 21-foot Fleetwood Jamboree 
Searcher, a Class C motor home, which means the camper is built atop a pickup 
truck (in this case a Ford) with sleeping accommodations for two in a windowed 
extension over the vehicle cab. 
</P>
<P>
 Four or six adult passengers get a 27-foot vehicle with cab-over bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Our favorite campground along the way was on the outskirts of Prince George, 
B.C., at Tabor Lake, where our closest neighbors were a pair of geese and two 
nesting pairs of horned grebes. The proprietor of the RV park, who also runs 
the elegant Log Cabin Restaurant on the hill, buzzed down to the campground on 
his moped, attired in his maitre d'hotel tuxedo and bow tie, to make sure we 
were comfortably settled in. 
</P>
<P>
 Top of the World Highway, a white-knuckle drive above tree line on a dirt road 
along a narrow ridge between Dawson City and Chicken, was the most exciting 
part of the trip, especially where the snowpack encroached on at least half the 
roadway and there were no guardrails. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chicken, a guided historic tour is available at 1 p.m. daily in the summer. 
The Chicken Saloon, Restaurant and Gift Shop also presents sled dog 
demonstrations in the snow season. 
</P>
<P>
 When we drove in about 10 a.m., plumes of red dust trailing behind us, the 
sled dogs perched atop their wooden posts perked up as if it were show time, 
while a thin, bearded man who could have sprung from 1968 hippie days shuffled 
out to our RV and murmured through the open window, "Welcome to Chicken. Only 
the gift shop and the saloon are open this morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Another option is the Inside Passage, a seven-day round trip sailing from 
Vancouver with port calls at Ketchikan, Juneau and Sitka and a daylong cruise 
through Glacier Bay. A seven-night RV driving loop from Vancouver to Banff, 
Lake Louise and Jasper complements the Inside Passage sailing aboard the 
Westerdam or Maasdam. Prices begin at $1,995 per person, double occupancy, for 
a seven-night RV journey into the Canadian Rockies and a seven-day cruise on 
the Inside Passage, or $2,995 for a 14-night RV trip along the Alaska Highway 
with a seven-day cruise on the Glacier Route. A seven-night RV program around 
Denali with the seven-day Glacier Route cruise starts at $2,495 per person, 
double occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
 These starting prices are for early season sailings and minimum-category 
inside (windowless) cabins on board ship. Upgrade supplements range from $50 to 
$4,050 per person additional for more expensive accommodations aboard ship. 
Children 2 and older sharing the shipboard stateroom with their parents only 
pay an additional $895-$1,595 for the package, depending on the length of the 
RV portion of the trip. 
</P>

323-5757.

BACKPACK & BUDGET; THE WISE ARE WARY ABROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of backpackers enjoy foreign adventures each year without 
encountering serious difficulties. But it is important to use caution and know 
how to prepare for a successful trip. 
</P>
<P>
 * Before checking into a budget hotel, look it over. Are there proper, 
unblocked fire exits? Could you get out fast, in the dark, if you had to? 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid rooms near stairways or on first floors; they provide easy exits for 
thieves. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure the windows and door of your room can be secured but easily opened 
if you had to get out and your vision was impaired. 
</P>
<P>
 * Count the number of doorways to the stairs so you could feel your way in the 
dark, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you're concerned about someone being able to enter during the night, 
consider packing a door wedge. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you are going to use an immersion heater for making coffee or soup in 
your room, be sure that it is the kind that automatically shuts off if it 
overheats. 
</P>
<P>
 * When sharing a room, don't leave your money belt out. Keep it with you at 
all times. Sleep with it in your bedding, and if you go to the shower, carry it 
in a resealable plastic bag or place it on top of the shower head. 
</P>
<P>
 When using trains and buses: 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't accept food or drinks from strangers. You can be drugged and then 
robbed while you are asleep. This problem has surfaced from Southern Europe to 
Southeast Asia. If you feel uncomfortable about turning down a new friend's 
hospitality, claim a food allergy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Carry your own padlock. Many budget hotels in Asia have latches you can use 
your own lock on, and many hostels provide lockers. Your own padlock or bike 
chain can also be handy for securing luggage to racks on trains or on bus 
roofs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't head off into a remote area with a local tour company or guide that is 
not licensed and well-respected by the community. You're putting yourself in a 
very  
</P>
<P>
 vulnerable position. When in doubt, check them out through the local tourist 
information office. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you decide to store your valuables in a hotel safe, put your credit cards 
in an envelope and seal and sign it so you can tell immediately if it has been 
tampered with. Some travelers have reported that after they got home, they 
found that their cards were used during the period when they thought they were 
safely locked up. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be wary of diversion tactics used to target weary tourists. Popular tactics 
include: someone spilling something on your shirt in an airport, and while 
helping to clean you, an accomplice cleans out your pockets; in Paris and Rome, 
kids hold paper in front of your face and while you struggle to get your 
bearings, pilfer your pockets; in Latin America, on busy buses, one thief will 
grope a female and while she is fending him off another picks her purse. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, if a deal sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Be wary of 
popular scams such as a jeweler in Asia who will tell you that you can resell 
gems at home for a much higher price (some will even offer you the names of 
stores to deal with). If this were such a great deal, wouldn't they be going 
after these huge profits themselves?

LEARNING VACATIONS; CLASS-ACT VACATIONS; LESSONS: FROM NATURE STUDY TO ESOTERIC 
SPORTS, THESE PROGRAMS FOCUS ON LEARNING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES T. YENCKEL, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Where do you go after Disney World? Maybe back to school, if you want a family 
vacation that combines learning with fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, programs that welcome families are scheduled in the summer to take 
advantage of school breaks, and almost always involve a lot of outdoor 
activities. The focus of many is nature, but some provide an opportunity to 
learn a new skill -- very often an outdoor sport, such as sea kayaking. These 
vacations can be fairly rugged or comfortably relaxed. A few are open to 
children of all ages; others are limited to older teens. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding these programs is not easy; most are small operations with limited 
funds for advertising. However, ads do appear occasionally in such 
travel-oriented magazines as Travel & Leisure, Southern Living and Outside. At 
several U.S. national parks, including Wyoming's Yellowstone and Colorado's 
Rocky Mountain, educational institutes put together learning programs for 
families. Also, check with the tourism office of the state in which you are 
interested in vacationing. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the North American possibilities: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wildlife lessons in Montana. Wildlife conservation is the theme of the 
family "edu-vacation" program at Lake Upsata Guest Ranch, which sits beside a 
small, woodland lake in the Blackfoot Valley of western Montana near Ovando. 
Wildlife biologists conduct informal wildlife seminars about wolves, waterfowl, 
elk, owls and other wilderness creatures, many of which can be spotted on the 
ranch.  
</P>
<P>
 When lessons are over, guests can sign up for fly-fishing courses or go 
canoeing, mountain biking, boating, hiking, rafting or take an escorted trail 
ride in the neighboring Bob Marshall Wilderness. The program is available from 
now into the fall. 
</P>

 Rippling curtains of rain. Sudden shafts of sharpening air. We're on holiday 
in London -- me, my wife and two daughters. Gogo, my 9-year-old, seems 
oblivious to the theatrical British weather. Absorbed in a fragile trance, she 
studies a brown beetle crawling up her hand. "This bug's head is so small!" she 
says. "I bet its brain can only hold one idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Gogo, who plots our summer and winter vacations with the world view of 
Alexander the Great, lives in her own ether. She has Pre-Raphaelite features, 
wide brown eyes that seem to be off on a secret, faraway trip and a quirky 
private smile. Her mind is a pinball machine: She has a gift for making 
associations that even James Joyce might admire. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is what I like about traveling with my kids. I'm enchanted not so much 
by their innocence as their skewed perceptions, their undiscriminating appetite 
for scraps of knowledge. Because everything in their experience is equally 
weighted, they see things whole, untainted, in clear air. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years back we took a family outing to Philadelphia's science museum, the 
Franklin Institute. We spent an instructive afternoon among exhibits that 
elucidated the physical laws of nature. On our way out, I bought Gogo a soft 
pretzel. She took a bite, dropped the wax paper into a trash can and began to 
giggle. "What's so funny?" I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gravity," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, our vacations have followed Gogo's pretzel logic. Wherever her 
imagination wanders, we follow. She so loved "The Diary of Anne Frank" that we 
went to Amsterdam for a closer reading. She wanted to walk up the hidden 
staircase, she said, tiptoe around the attic and peek into the water closet to 
check out Anne's chain toilet. And happily, Gogo did. Still, the secret annex 
perplexed her. "There's something I can't figure out," she said plaintively. 
"How did Anne Frank keep so quiet in wooden shoes?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gogo was more contemplative than confused on our odyssey to Greece two winters 
ago. The Rock of the Sibyl at Delphi delighted her. The Palace of Minos in 
Knossos enthralled her. The Acropolis Museum's statue of Cerberus, the 
multi-headed mutt that watched over the realm of the dead, left her rapturously 
agog. Yet when we got to the sacred spot she most wanted to visit -- the Cave 
of Hades in Eleusis -- she shuffled along silently, head down, shoes scraping 
the ancient stones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you OK, Gogo?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure," she said without lifting her eyes. "I'm having fun just kicking the 
Gods' dust." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a Greek connection -- sort of -- that piqued Gogo's interest in England 
last summer. "You'll like it there," said Maggie, her mother. "Londoners travel 
by underground." 
</P>
<P>
 "That sounds cool," Gogo said. "But are you allowed to pet Cerberus?" 
</P>
<P>
 If our tour of Great Britain has a theme, it's mystery. We begin at 221B Baker 
St., home to the new Sherlock Holmes Museum. All spring I'd been reading his 
adventures aloud to Gogo and her 6-year-old sister, Daisy. But they weren't 
really hooked until they saw Jeremy Brett's sublimely over-the-top Holmes on 
PBS. Days after watching an episode, they'd still be reciting lines of 
dialogue: "Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention? "To 
the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime." "The dog did nothing in the 
nighttime." "That was the curious incident." 
</P>
<P>
 At the front door, a private bobby monitors the queue. "Will I get to see the 
blue carbuncle?" Gogo asks him. "Sherlock Holmes said he's put it in his 
museum." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid we couldn't actually get the blue carbuncle," says the bobby. "But 
if you look around, I'm sure you'll find the five orange pips." 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, 221B falls between 237, a real estate office, and 241, a chartered 
accountant firm. We climb the 17 steps to the sitting room, which is crammed 
with enough Victorian nostalgia to make the master exclaim in his high, 
somewhat strident tones: "Entirely meretricious!" Gogo inspects every alleged 
artifact: the severed digit from "The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb," the 
stuffed swamp adder from "The Adventure of the Speckled Band," the locket of 
hair from "The Adventure of the Copper Beeches." "Whoever cut this hair didn't 
use scissors," she deduces. "It must have been done with a dull knife." 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it was chewed off," offers Daisy. 
</P>
<P>
 Gogo rolls her eyes heavenward. 
</P>
<P>
 Propped above a mantle is the hair-trigger revolver Holmes fired one dull day 
into the sitting room wall, describing the initials "VR" -- Victoria Regina. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does VR spell?" yells Daisy. 
</P>
<P>
 Gogo raises a finger to her lips, shushing her little sister. "Very rude," she 
whispers. 
</P>
<P>
 The maids clear out the chambers for an eminent Sherlockian who has come all 
the way from Japan. He wears a deerstalker and Inverness cape, and holds aloft 
an out-sized magnifying glass. Striding purposefully across the room, he parts 
the drapes, looks up and down Baker Street, does an abrupt about-face and 
shouts, "Aha!" 
</P>
<P>
 Then he leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Gogo studies the impostor dispassionately. Daisy raises a slightly heretical 
question: "Was there a real Sherlock Holmes, or was he just paper?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gogo pulls on the brims of her own deerstalker and draws deeply on her plastic 
calabash. "That," she says at last, "is a three-pipe problem." 
</P>
<P>
 We repair to the Sherlock Holmes Hotel to puzzle this out over bowls of Great 
British pudding ("cook's homemade pudding with lashings of custard"). "Sherlock 
Holmes was alive and paper," Gogo says between lashings. "It's like Bloody 
Mary: She was a queen and a drink." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Appropriately enough, our next stop is Buckingham Palace. The joint is open to 
paying tourists for the first time, and, as Gogo says, "I always wanted to see 
the Queen's place." 
</P>
<P>
 Gogo asks how to act if she should chance upon Her Majesty having a spot of 
tea in the Throne Room. Maggie says, "Just pretend she's not wearing a crown." 
I add helpfully, "And don't offer her a stick of bubble gum." We are funneled 
through 18 exceedingly formal rooms redolent of majesty. William IV called the 
place "hideous." Edward VIII complained of its "curious musty odor." A TV 
pundit compares it to a tandoori curry house. 
</P>
<P>
 Gogo offers her own detailed critique. "The red carpets are really ugly," she 
says of the newly laid Axminster. "They're the same ones at the Holiday Inn." 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not!" protests Daisy. "Holiday  
</P>
<P>
 Inn carpets aren't this fuzzy. These are more like the Sheraton's." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, yeah? So where's the big S in the middle?" 
</P>
<P>
 They dash off through the Green, Blue and White drawing rooms. We lose sight 
of them in the crimson Throne Room, where they pause briefly to check out the 
squat monogrammed chairs. Gogo eventually resurfaces in the Picture Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's Daisy?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Your sister?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, her. I don't know, where?" 
</P>
<P>
 We alert a warden, who alerts other wardens. Pretty soon there's an all-points 
palace bulletin for a "3-foot-10-inch American in a Betty Boop T-shirt." Gogo 
finds her in the royal loo. 
</P>
<P>
 Daisy is chastened, Gogo chagrined."Here's a real mystery," Gogo announces. 
"Why does the queen have such rough toilet paper?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Our final conundrum unravels in Portmeirion, a tiny, Italianate dream-town 
boldly planted amid the slatey cliffs and wide, sandy estuaries of North Wales. 
Planned and built by Welsh eccentric Sir Clough Williams-Ellis in the 1920s and 
'30s, this architectural fantasia of columns, cornices and campaniles was the 
setting for the '60s TV series "The Prisoner." The show told the story of a 
British secret agent who, after resigning his post, was abducted and held 
captive by powers unknown in a timeless hamlet called "the village." Everyone 
is under surveillance; no one has a name, only a number; and there is no 
knowing who is a friend and who is a spy. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been more than a quarter of a century since the series first aired. But 
"Prisoner" hajjis still pilgrimage to Portmeirion for an annual two-day synod. 
They cavort as villagers, re-enact scenes from the show and paw over its 
ambiguities. Everything is accomplished with scrupulous and impeccable 
seriousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Gogo and Daisy are big fans themselves. They've watched all 17 episodes and 
have memorized the mantra of Number 6, the show's hero. "I will not be pushed, 
filed, stamped, indexed, briefed, debriefed or numbered!" they chant over and 
over during the five-hour drive from London. "My life is my own." 
</P>
<P>
 The sun is going down when we finally check into the Portmeirion Hotel. "I'll 
need some information," says the desk clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 "You won't get it!" snaps Gogo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ha! So you're here for the Prisoner convention." 
</P>
<P>
 Daisy, who's still not sure if Sherlock Holmes was or wasn't, is even more 
nonplussed by this diabolical Disneyland. The BBC film crew on hand to document 
the event only reinforces her impression that we're part of an ongoing 
television show. When we get to our room, she looks behind the paintings and 
mirrors for hidden cameras and microphones. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a knock at the door. "May I turn down your bed?" asks a voice. Daisy 
crouches timidly behind Gogo, who sputters, "What's wrong? Is it too loud?" 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning we pad past pillared porticoes, splashing fountains and 
numerous pastel-colored villas to Number 6's house, now a shop that sells 
"Prisoner" maps and bumper stickers as if they were souvenirs from Lourdes. We 
ramble up a cobblestone path to the green Florentine dome, where the 
arch-interrogator, Number 2, once plotted to break Number 6's will. We ramble 
down to the pink gloriette , the speaker's platform, where Number 6 once tried 
to rouse the villagers to rebellion. We amble around the green, with its 
fanciful statuary and colonnades, where scores of middle-age "Prisoner" 
wanna-bes mill about in striped blazers, straw boaters and flowing capes. 
They're restaging the human chess game from Episode 11. Instead of name tags, 
these conventioneers sport badges bearing their numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 None of which matters much to Gogo and Daisy, who search in vain for Patrick 
McGoohan, the actor who played Number 6. McGoohan has never appeared at one of 
these confabs. He seems to regard the whole exercise with something approaching 
disdain. He's forever besieged by "Prisoner" cultists seeking answers to the 
show's riddles. "I've become a prisoner of 'The Prisoner,' " he once lamented.  
</P>
<P>
 In the 18th-Century Town Hall, we watch a short film McGoohan apparently made 
to appease the "Prisoner" faithful. Strolling under a pier in Santa Monica, he 
pauses to fish a coat hanger out of the surf. He keeps sketching hangers in the 
sand, only to have them rubbed out by the sea. "Prisoner" cineastes call this 
bit of whimsy "The L.A. Tape." 
</P>
<P>
 After the screening, Gogo stumbles into a discussion group near the piazza. A 
bunch of earnest villagers are mulling the tape's meaning. "The hanger stands 
for the Great Pyramid of Cheops," insists a woman whose badge identifies her as 
52. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me," says someone numbered 39, "it looks like a question mark on a 
pedestal. McGoohan wants us to keep questioning our beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
 It's Gogo's turn. "Young lady," says 43 solemnly. "What do you think McGoohan 
means?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he means it's time to hang it up."

DESTINATION ESCONDIDO; SO NEAR, SAFARI; A CAMPING TRIP AT THE WILD ANIMAL PARK 
OFFERS A TAME TASTE OF THE AFRICAN VELDT

<P>
 Here's what a Sumatran tiger sounds like at night: Uuuurrrrrgggh. Belch. 
</P>
<P>
 A cheetah makes sucking-hissing sounds, and Asian elephants . . . well, you 
name it, they do it. 
</P>
<P>
 I know, because I recently spent an evening listening to this exotic cacophony 
while tucked into a tent with my husband and 8-year-old daughter at the San 
Diego Wild Animal Park near Escondido.  
</P>
<P>
 The occasion was a new park program called "Roar & Snore," which runs every 
Friday and Saturday night through October. For $70 per adult and $55 per child, 
our band of 45 campers had more fun than a barrel of monkeys -- and a taste of 
an East African safari without passports or malaria pills. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit, 2,100-acre Wild Animal Park, established in 1972, features five 
open-field exhibits enclosed by chain-link fences and walls. Except for the 
aviary, there are no cages or bars: Exhibit areas are designed to mimic the 
animals' natural environments and enhance the park's breeding program (the park 
is now home to 46 endangered species.) Most visitors experience the park and 
its 3,500 denizens from an electric monorail that skirts the edge of the 
reserve on a five-mile, 55-minute ride. But as we discovered last month, "Roar 
& Snore" participants get a much more intimate view: A night spent overlooking 
the East Africa compound, a sprawling, 125-acre fenced valley laced with 
giraffes, rhinos, gazelles and lots of other wildlife.  
</P>
<P>
 We arrived at the park entrance a bit after 4 on a hazy spring Friday 
afternoon and joined the loosely assembled group -- retired couples, students 
and families. (Children must be at least 8 to participate, though a sleep-over 
program at the sister San Diego Zoo -- both parks are run by the San Diego 
Zoological Society -- takes kids as young as 4.). 
</P>
<P>
 As we lugged our sleeping bags and overstuffed backpacks the half mile to the 
picnic area-turned-campground, we realized we should have paid closer attention 
to the brochure warning us to bring only what can be comfortably carried. But 
the strain was more than offset by watching tired tourists heading in the 
opposite direction for the exit -- closing time is 5 p.m. Soon we would have 
the whole place to ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The dome tents -- supplied and set up by 
</P>
<P>
 the park -- were clustered like a colony of green igloos on a tree-shaded 
knoll just outside the perimeter of the fenced East Africa compound. We plunked 
our gear inside, then turned to watch a couple of giraffes ambling elegantly 
near the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Our guides invited us to join them at a row of picnic tables rimmed by 
monkey-pod trees, where gallons of thirst-quenching lemonade waited. The more 
curious among us were invited to peruse laminated book pages with information 
on some of the animals we were viewing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As hamburgers and chicken sizzled on a huge outdoor grill, we were treated to 
a show-and-tell -- the first in a series of scheduled events, all optional. My 
daughter stroked the back of a docile 30-pound South American boa constrictor 
-- it felt like a muscle on Arnold Schwarzenegger's forearm. I tugged on the 
prehensile tail of a brown, furry kinkajou with nervous eyes. This South 
American rain-forest creature looks like a distant cousin of a monkey but is 
actually part of the raccoon family. He was found half-starved, foraging in a 
trash bin in downtown San Diego, the obvious victim of an exotic-animal 
smuggler. 
</P>
<P>
 We all got to handle an ostrich egg the size of a football. The bird is 
considered extremely dumb. How dumb? Well, the creatures always put one egg in 
front of them while sitting on the nest so they won't forget why they're there. 
</P>
<P>
 Our group attacked the grilled grub with the gusto of a herd of wildebeests, 
which is just what we could see grazing nearby. Funny how the outdoors can make 
simple pork and beans so appetizing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the food was no competition for the animals. "Look, a white rhino! I see 
two of them!" Elizabeth yelled out, causing everyone to pause in mid-munch. 
Kids rushed to the fence while grown-ups peered through binoculars -- an item 
as essential as a sleeping bag on this outing. 
</P>
<P>
 Satiated, we were ready to help digestion along with a twilight trek to 
observe some nocturnal animals just emerging from their daytime slumbers. It 
turned out to be the highlight of the stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger Susan Normandia proved an excellent camp guide. Her enthusiasm for the 
park and its animals was matched by her knowledge of its flora and fauna. As we 
walked along the Kilimanjaro trail, she noted that five varieties of bats live 
in the park -- and whooosh! We got buzzed. 
</P>
<P>
 Approaching the Sumatra tiger compound, I strained for a glimpse of a big cat 
and scanned the tall grass with my binoculars. Suddenly I saw his huge head 
about 30 feet away, then his crouched body. A pair of intense green eyes 
snapped into focus. They were staring right back at me, unblinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh look," Susan said, in a blase tone. "We're being stalked." 
</P>
<P>
 God bless the inventor of the chain-link fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Farther up the trail we came to another compound, where two lionesses emerged 
from a wooded thicket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, kitty, kitty," one camper said, giggling. 
</P>
<P>
 The felines walked right up to the fence -- we could have reached out and 
stroked their whiskers. They both had the deliberate and quiet manner of a 
predator checking out dinner. The giggles stopped, and a hush enveloped the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Then one of the big cats yawned, and the other sat down panting, still staring 
at potential prey. And cursing the fence? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After walking uphill a few minutes, we stopped at the Kupanda Banda pavilion, 
where we got to rest on folding chairs arranged in front of a screen while our 
guides orchestrated a slide-show game. They played a taped sound, and we tried 
to guess what animal made it. (That's where we learned that elephants make 
about 20 distinguishable sounds.) After a few seconds, they'd project a slide 
of the animal.  
</P>
<P>
 This activity provided a lot of fodder for the jokers among us. "My husband 
snoring!" squealed one woman upon hearing a grunting sound. It turned out to be 
an elephant seal. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother-in-law!" cried another. It was a laughing hyena. 
</P>
<P>
 By now we'd turned into a raucous group, so the guide directed us down the 
hill for a bit of star-gazing that was thwarted by heavy cloud cover. No one 
seemed to mind, though. We sauntered back to camp for a bit of flashlight 
viewing of the animals from a nearby observation deck, then a late-night snack 
of hot chocolate and s'mores around the campfire. 
</P>
<P>
 It was approaching 10 p.m. Someone had finally turned off the 
water-reclamation pump, an irritating industrial sound that threatened to ruin 
the aural experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, lights out. Time to settle into cozy sleeping bags like a family of bears 
in a den, rested and ready for the sunrise bird walk. As we drifted off, we 
could hear a quartet of croaking frogs, a few crickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Mother Nature turned up the volume. 
</P>
<P>
 Screech, caw-caw, grrrrruunt, moan. Whoop, whoop, whoop, wheeeeeee! 
</P>
<P>
 "What's that?" a wide-eyed Elizabeth asked.  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's the same tiger that escaped during those heavy rainstorms last 
year, I said, recounting an earlier conversation I had had with a camp guide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ohhhhhh Mom." 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth was soon snoring louder than the lions. It would have taken a herd 
of wild elephants to stop me from joining her. But my poor husband, a light 
sleeper, spent a restless night deciphering sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Our wake-up call came at 5:45 -- from a loudspeaker and twittering birds. 
Bleary-eyed, we made our way to the other campers clutching steaming cups of 
coffee and trying to shake kinks out of bodies unaccustomed to sleeping on the 
ground.  
</P>
<P>
 Our guide started us at a brisk pace on a nature trail through the southern 
area of the park that is not open to the public. This behind-the-scenes route 
goes through a marshy area and lots of nesting herons and egrets that would 
probably take flight if they were subjected to daily hordes of tourists. Near a 
compound of nesting ostriches, the guide pointed out wood storks and brown 
pelicans, also on the endangered-species list. Overhead a couple of snowy 
egrets soared like feathery glider planes, their long necks and beaks creating 
an elegant silhouette. 
</P>
<P>
 We returned from the hour-long trek with elephant-size appetites for pancakes, 
sausages and fruit salad. Then it was time to break camp and head back to the 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the early rising, we had plenty of energy for more animal viewing. As 
we made plans to deposit our gear and return to the park, we chatted about the 
previous evening. It was our first time camping as a family, and it had proven 
to be a painless introduction to the call of the wild. GUIDEBOOK

DESTINATION ESCONDIDO; ZOO-LOVER'S FAVORITE DOZEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN W. NYHUIS, Nyhuis, an Indianapolis, Ind., statistician, is author of 
The Zoo Book: A Guide to America's Best (Carousel Press, $14.95). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With two world-class zoos in their own back yard, Southern Californians could 
be excused for thinking they've seen it all. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the San Diego Zoo's 4,000 animals of 820 species represent a 
greater diversity than any other facility in the United States -- and the zoo's 
plant collection is so superb it's been accredited as a botanical garden and 
museum as well. The Los Angeles Zoo, meanwhile, includes one of the country's 
most innovative children's zoos. 
</P>
<P>
 But while researching a new book, I toured more than 55 zoos across the 
country -- many with my three young children in tow. And I'm convinced each one 
offers vacationing families something unique -- from theme park-like 
attractions such as monorails and sky rides to realistic recreations of a North 
American prairie or a Louisiana bayou. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are a dozen favorites: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Apple Valley, Minn.: A monorail and significant indoor exhibits make the 
lakeside Minnesota Zoo (telephone 612-432-9000) equally appealing all year 
round. Located 20 miles south of the Twin Cities, the zoo features an extensive 
collection of animals from the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere: 
timber wolves, Mongolian wild horses, musk oxen, caribou and moose, among 
others. The highlight of the indoor/outdoor Minnesota Trail is the beaver 
exhibit, in which visitors can watch the animals gnaw through aspen saplings, 
repair a dam or cavort underwater. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Asheboro, N.C.: America's largest zoo, the 1,400-acre North Carolina 
Zoological Park (tel. 800-488-0444 or 910-879-7000), specializes in African 
animals. Bring binoculars to fully appreciate the African Plains, an exhibit 
that is larger than many zoos. Inside the African Pavilion, the winding jungle 
path passes a variety of reptiles, monkeys, cats and other small mammals. I 
spent a fascinating hour in the Forest Aviary searching for Lady Ross' 
touracos, Palawan peacock pheasants and the many other colorful birds pictured 
in the visitor guide. The zoo will nearly double in size this fall when the new 
North American section opens. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore, Md.: With its new children's zoo (in my opinion, the nation's 
best), the Baltimore Zoo (tel. 410-396-7102) has moved out of the shadow of 
Washington's nearby, better-known National Zoo. Kids love this place, where 
activities include climbing into oriole nests, otter-watching from an 
underwater acrylic tunnel, splashing on king-sized lily pads and playing on a 
woolly-mammoth skeleton jungle gym. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brookfield, Ill.: Located in a western Chicago suburb, the Brookfield Zoo 
(tel. 708-485-0263) is the Midwest's best. Most of its amazing exhibits are 
inside large, climate-controlled buildings. The centerpiece is Tropic World, 
larger than a football field, where a treetop-level path overlooks three jungle 
valleys -- home of gorillas, orangutans and many creatures of the Asian, South 
American, and African rain forests. My children especially enjoyed the "Be a 
Bird" activities in the Aquatic Bird House. The new Habitat Africa! combines 
natural animal exhibits with interactive activities for kids. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati, Ohio: White Bengal tigers, okapis, Komodo dragons and a stunning 
king cheetah are some of the many rare animals at the Cincinnati Zoo and 
Botanical Garden (tel. 513-281-4700). Insect World, the best exhibit of its 
kind, includes exotic butterflies and inch-long bullet ants in a fun, 
museum-like setting. My daughter discovered that she weighs as much as 8 
million insects. Also popular is the Cat House, home to more than 20 different 
rare cats. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ft. Worth, Tex.: The Fort Worth Zoo (tel. 817-871-7050)is probably the best of 
Texas' six major zoos. The Texas exhibit's re-created pioneer town includes a 
stone ranch house, one-room schoolhouse, operating blacksmith shop and dusty 
corrals full of tame farm animals -- along with plenty of longhorn cattle, 
bison and prairie dogs. The World of Primates, a massive indoor rain forest, is 
the only place in the U.S. where all four great-ape species can be compared. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New Orleans, La.: Less than 20 years ago, the Audubon Park and Zoological 
Gardens (tel. 504-861-2537) was derided as an "animal ghetto." Since then, 
extensive renovations have made it perhaps the finest zoo between San Diego and 
New York. The bayou creatures of the award-winning Louisiana Swamp exhibit 
include red foxes, black bears, cougars and my favorite, the blue-eyed white 
alligators. At the Cypress Knee Cafe, visitors can lunch Cajun-style on gumbo 
or jambalaya while overlooking the gator-filled swamp. Children enjoy the funny 
sea lion show, the educational Reptile Encounter building and Pathways to the 
Past (a hands-on dinosaur museum).  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New York City: The Bronx Zoo (tel. 718-367-1010) occupies 265 acres in New 
York's northernmost borough -- making it the largest urban zoo in America. Asia 
is a major focus here, with the incredible JungleWorld building (home to the 
Indonesian scrub forest, mangrove forest of Borneo and Southeast Asian rain 
forest), the Wild Asia monorail tour and the adorable red pandas and snow 
leopards of the Himalayan Highlands Habitat (my daughters' favorites). My kids 
also enjoyed the outstanding children's zoo and the high-flying sky ride with a 
distant view of Manhattan's skyscrapers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Omaha, Neb.: Nowhere else is the goal of immersing human visitors into the 
animals' environment more successful than in the Lied Jungle at Omaha's Henry 
Doorly Zoo (tel. 402-733-8401). In fact, the only way zoo-goers can tell this 
immense, 1 1/2-acre indoor rain forest isn't real is by spotting the 
translucent fiberglass roof 80 feet above the jungle floor. My family loved 
climbing to Danger Point (at the crest of a 50-foot waterfall) and exploring 
the jungle floor with its underwater views of hippos, tapirs, otters and 
crocodiles. The zoo also has the world's second-largest walk-through aviary and 
the Cat Complex, the nation's largest cat building with more than 50 big cats. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Portland, Ore.: Known as the "City of Roses," Portland is also famous as the 
"City of Elephants" -- thanks to the Metro Washington Park Zoo (tel. 
503-226-1561), with its fascinating Elephant Museum. (More Asian elephants are 
born here than in any other North American zoo.) Other adventures include a 
complete African tour (both savanna and rain forest), a trek through the Alaska 
tundra and the wooded Cascade Exhibit, where beavers, otters and other 
Oregonian wildlife are displayed. Don't miss the best train ride in any U.S. 
zoo; it winds along a heavily wooded, four-mile course and ends near the famous 
International Rose Test Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio, Tex.: The centerpiece of the excellent children's zoo at the San 
Antonio Zoo (tel. 210-734-7184) is the Tropical Tour Boat Ride, which takes 
families past several animal-inhabited islands on small versions of the 
colorful water taxis that ply the city's Riverwalk. Especially impressive is 
the zoo's bird collection; among the 230-plus species are quetzals, birds of 
paradise and whooping cranes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wichita, Kan.: The Sedgwick County Zoo (tel. 316-942-2212) gets my vote as the 
most underrated zoo in America. Its new North American Prairie exhibit includes 
a walk-through prairie dog town and buffalo, deer and antelope roaming "at home 
on the range." The Children's Farms display colorful buildings and animals that 
represent African, Asian and American farms.

SUMMER ITINERARIES; TEN FOR THE ROAD; IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO PLAN ONE OF THESE 
LAST-MINUTE FAMILY GETAWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN OGINTZ, Ogintz is the author of Taking the Kids, which appears 
weekly. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The oh-so-organized neighbors have been bragging all winter about their June 
Grand Canyon reservations. The cousins and their kids are blathering about 
bears and bald eagles as they finalize plans for an August trip to Alaska. A 
business partner, meanwhile, can't stop talking about the incredible 
children-go-free deal her family got by booking their July cruise in February.  
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly your kids are complaining that everyone in the world has "awesome" 
summer vacations lined up -- except them. Don't worry -- a lot of families are 
in the same boat. Last year, according to a Better Homes and Gardens Family 
Travel Survey, 60% of family vacationers booked hotel and travel reservations 
within a month of their trip -- despite the fact that 40% of those families 
were traveling during the peak summer season. That's not to say you can go 
everywhere and anywhere this summer. You can probably forget about booking a 
room at the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park, reserving a houseboat 
rental on Lake Powell or rafting through the Grand Canyon -- unless you happen 
to call immediately after someone else has canceled. But there are still plenty 
of terrific options available, from national parks to down-home ranches to posh 
Caribbean and Hawaiian resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are even downright bargains. For one thing, the list of kid-friendly 
properties is growing rapidly, and each must work harder than ever to snare the 
value-conscious family market. At the same time, it's considered low season in 
destinations such as the Caribbean and the Rockies, though the weather is 
great, and there are just as many family-oriented activities. 
</P>
<P>
 So grab the calendar and get out the credit card. It may take a few phone 
calls, but it will be worth the effort to line up one of these last-minute 
escapes: 1. Through the Woods  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, according to the National Park Service, visitors spent nearly as 
much time in the 10 most popular national parks as in the rest of the service's 
367 sites combined. The less-crowded parks and national recreation areas, 
meanwhile, offer just as many chances to hike, see wildlife, camp and swim -- 
as well as more peace and quiet and a better chance of landing a nearby 
campsite or motel room. 
</P>
<P>
 Take North Cascades National Park 80 miles northeast of Seattle. It's got 
heart-stopping mountain scenery, biking and back-country hiking. Operated 
jointly with Ross Lake and Lake Chelan national recreation areas, it's also a 
terrific spot for boating, kayaking, fishing and float trips.  
</P>
<P>
 No city-sized crowds here: "Most weekends in July you could arrive and get a 
campsite in a beautiful campground or get a permit for backcountry camping," 
says park spokesman Tim Manns (for information, telephone 206-856-5700). 
</P>
<P>
 The National Park Service also can help steer you to other lesser-known -- and 
invariably less crowded -- parks, such as Lassen Volcanic National Park in 
Northern California, Great Basin National Park in Nevada, or Organ Pipe Cactus 
National Monument in Arizona. Call the National Park Service at (202) 208-4747 
or write Office of Public Inquiries, National Park Service, P.O. Box 37127, 
Washington, D.C. 20013-7127. Or send $1.50 postpaid for a copy of "Lesser-Known 
Parks" to Supt. of Documents, U.S. Govt. Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 
20402-9325. Ask for Stock Number 024-005-00911-6. 2. Ride 'Em Cowboy  
</P>
<P>
 Billy Crystal and his pals aren't the only city slickers who've discovered 
that saddling up at a Western dude ranch offers an ideal antidote to the 
pressures of dodging semis on Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Dave Wiggins of American Wilderness Experience, which represents 
more than 50 ranches across the West, bookings shot up at least 20% when "City 
Slickers" came out in 1991 -- and Wiggins is expecting another burst of 
reservations when "City Slickers II" is released this month. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point though, you can can still wrangle a booking throughout the 
summer, although the most space is available in June, early July and the end of 
August, says Wiggins (tel. 800-444-DUDE, 800-444-3833). Most ranches require 
that kids be at least 6 to participate in riding programs, though baby-sitting 
and other activities increasingly are offered for younger children. Fishing, 
hiking, nature programs, even tennis courts and swimming pools are available at 
some properties. 
</P>
<P>
 The price is right, too -- typically $3,000 to $3,500 a week for a family of 
four, including all meals, accommodations and activities. 3. City by the Bay  
</P>
<P>
 Go ahead. Talk to the sea lions. They're sure to bark back. 
</P>
<P>
 Your kids can chat with plenty of the critters at Pier 39 in San Francisco or 
at the Marine Mammal Center, a nonprofit hospital for sick sea lions and seals 
near Sausalito in the Marin Headlands. Here medical staff and hundreds of 
volunteers nurse sick and injured sea lions back to health and return them to 
the ocean. (Call 415-289-SEAL, 415-289-7325.) 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, San Francisco offers children much more than gregarious sea lions. 
Kids love the Japanese Tea Garden in Golden Gate Park, the Exploratorium with 
its hands-on science exhibits and the curio shops on Fisherman's Wharf. Outdoor 
festivals are a summertime draw, too: The Soapbox Derby July 17 at the newly 
expanded Bay Area Discovery Museum in Sausalito, the Street Performers Festival 
June 11 at Pier 39 or the Festival of the Sea Aug. 26 to 28 at Hyde Street 
Pier. Information: tel. (415) 391-2000.  
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco Reservations, a private reservations service, offers savings of 
20% to 50% on area hotel rooms and the rundown on the latest family packages 
(tel. 800-677-1550). 4. Campfire Time  
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 camps across the country run family programs where both parents 
and kids take part in an array of camp activities from swimming to archery to 
arts and crafts. Even better than the ambience is the price, typically under 
$1,500 a week for a family of four. And there's not a meal to prepare or a dish 
to wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many camps that only offer a week or two for families and are booked 
months ahead, Montecito-Sequoia High Sierra Vacation Camp in Sequoia National 
Forest, about 65 miles east of Fresno, operates all summer as a family camp. A 
children's program guarantees parents get a break too. "There's still room for 
June and July," says director Virginia Barnes, a former educator (tel. 
800-227-9900). 
</P>
<P>
 For a complete listing of camps and family camp programs in Southern 
California, call the American Camping Assn. office at (818) 223-9232. For 
Northern California listings, call the ACA Northern California office at (415) 
453-1832. 5. Hit the Slopes  
</P>
<P>
 Ski resorts from California's Mammoth Mountain to Park City and Snowbird in 
Utah to Keystone and Vail in Colorado are working hard to sell families on 
summer sunshine as well as winter snow. 
</P>
<P>
 There's hiking amid wildflowers, mountain biking on the ski slopes, horseback 
riding, golf and tennis for mom and dad, and day camp for the kids at some 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 Even better, lodging prices have been slashed as much as 60% from high-season 
winter rates. For example, a two-bedroom condo at Keystone goes for as little 
as $60 a night (tel. 800-222-0188). Hotel rooms in Park City can be had for $49 
a night (tel. 800-222-7275) while Mammoth Adventure Connection offers several 
mountain-biking packages (tel. 800-228-4947). 6. Aloha 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks in part to recently introduced air fares as low as $219 round trip from 
Los Angeles to Honolulu and $239 to Maui (prices go up this month to at least 
$319 round trip to Honolulu, $349 to Maui), Hawaiian hotels and condos are 
attracting more summer business than they have in several years. But resort and 
condo spokesmen say there's still plenty of room -- and lots of nature hikes, 
hula lessons and native storytelling sessions to keep the kids amused while 
parents golf, swim or snooze by the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Many hotels and condos offer "kids stay free" deals, or 50% discounts on a 
second room when parents occupy the first. Ask about other specials too: the 
Sheraton Waikiki is offering a free children's program this summer (tel. 
800-325-3535), as is the Aston Kaanapali Shores, for ages 2 to 10, after a $10 
registration fee, which includes a T-shirt (tel. 800-922-7866). The Embassy 
Suites Kaanapali Beach Resort's "Family Suite" deal includes four nights stay 
at the hotel with daily breakfast, a mid-sized sedan with unlimited mileage and 
admission for two kids to the Beach Buddies program, for $895 per family of 
four (tel. 800-362-2779). 7. Land of Enchantment  
</P>
<P>
 Oh-so-trendy Santa Fe, which prides itself on its galleries and restaurants, 
still can't decide how it feels about pint-sized visitors. But Santa Fe's 
neighbor 67 miles to the north welcomes kids with open arms. It's easy to 
understand why artist Georgia O'Keefe was so mesmerized by the landscape here. 
Go hiking or mountain biking in Carson National Forest, or head out on a 
day-long llama trek into the Sangre De Cristo Mountains ($75 for adults, $50 
for kids 6-12 through Wild Earth Llama Adventures; tel. 800-758-LAMA or 
800-758-5262). 
</P>
<P>
 "Except for the week after Christmas and July 4th, there's no problem getting 
a place to stay in Taos -- as long as you call two weeks in advance," says a 
spokesman for the Taos Chamber of Chamber (tel. 800-732-TAOS or 800-732-8267). 
Be sure to ask for a free copy of the "Kid's Guide to Taos." 8. White Water  
</P>
<P>
 You don't need to tackle rapids with names like Widow Maker to have a great 
time on a family rafting trip this summer. Most companies require participants 
to be at least 7, but some will take kids as young as 4.  
</P>
<P>
 "Rivers are rated on a scale of one to six, depending on the size of the 
rapids," explains Kay Metherell, a spokesman for OARS, a major West Coast 
rafting company (tel. 800-346-6277). "Families can head for rivers where the 
rapids aren't that dangerous, Class 3 or less." 
</P>
<P>
 On the West Coast, popular family rivers include the South Fork of the 
American, the Lower Tuolumne, the Sacramento and the Rogue. Other favorites 
include the Green River in Utah and the Salmon River in Idaho. Many outfitters 
offer special "family trips" with child-oriented games and activities and 
discounted rates for kids. Count on spending about $100-$150 per day for 
adults, including meals; about 10% to 15% less for kids. America Outdoors, a 
professional association of river outfitters, offers a free directory listing 
of its 260 members ($5 if you want it mailed first class.) Contact America 
Outdoors at P.O. Box 1348, Knoxville, Tenn. 37901; tel. (615) 524-4814. 9. On 
the High Seas 
</P>
<P>
 By offering their steepest discounts up to a year before the sailing date, 
cruise lines have prompted many vacationers to book ahead. But there are still 
a few last-minute deals, if you're flexible about dates, ships and itineraries. 
A family of four can still cruise the Caribbean on a low- to mid-priced ship 
for under $4,000, including air fare from Los Angeles, says Rick Kaplan, 
president of Los Angeles-based Family Cruise Club, a division of Cruisemasters 
(tel. 800-242-9000). Closer to home, kids under 2 sail free and kids 2-16 pay 
$49 (subject to availability) for a three- or four-night cruise aboard 
Norwegian Cruise Lines' Southward, which sails every week from Los Angeles to 
Ensenada. Call (800) 327-7030. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal Caribbean's Viking Serenade also sails to Ensenada and charges $49 rates 
for children 12 and under; tel. (800) 327-6700. In Hawaii, a child can cruise 
free on American Hawaii with two adults. Best availability for family-size 
cabins is in mid- to late August. Call (800) 765-7000. 10. No Worries, Mon  
</P>
<P>
 Caribbean resorts aren't out of your financial reach -- in summer anyway. 
Prices typically are 30% less than in winter. 
</P>
<P>
 For Southern Californians, Jamaica is only about 5 1/2 hours away on nonstop 
charter flights. Tower Air flies to Montego Bay each Saturday from July 2 
through Aug. 27; Rich International leaves Sundays from LAX (stopping at San 
Francisco) and returns nonstop to LAX the following Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some families opt for renting condos or villas. (Call the Jamaica Assn. of 
Villas and Apartments at 800-845-5276.) Others prefer all-inclusive family 
resorts such as the Franklyn D. Resort, which provides a Girl Friday to help 
entertain the little ones, plus an array of morning-till-evening children's 
activities. FDR currently is offering each parent a $350 air credit from Los 
Angeles. Weekly rates average $1,600 an adult; kids under 16 are free (tel. 
800-654-1337). 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call the Jamaican Tourist Board in Los Angeles at (213) 
384-1123.

BEFORE YOU COMMIT, ASK ABOUT THE BASICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAMELA THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before you call about properties, figure out what's important to you. Do you 
want to be in town, within walking distance of the basics? Do you prefer a more 
pastoral setting? Is a view of the mountains important? What about lawn 
furniture?  
</P>
<P>
 If you're a parent, think of what will make a vacation easier. If you have 
small children, consider a fenced-in yard or bedrooms on the same floor. If you 
have teen-agers, you might want to be close to places they can go on their own. 
You'll probably want a washer-dryer, and, of course, it's fun to watch TV in a 
foreign country (Darkwing Duck in French!). 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, the owner or caretaker of a property rented through a U.S. agency 
will speak at least some English, but ask ahead of time if you're worried about 
communicating. The owner may also help you find an English-speaking 
baby-sitter; Hideaways International's catalogue lists such information in 
their brochure.  
</P>
<P>
 Agencies will provide interior and exterior photographs of properties, 
sometimes color glossies, sometimes black-and-white photocopies. But don't rely 
on photos alone: It's a good idea to speak directly with an agency staffer who 
has actually seen the property. The agency will provide you with detailed 
information, from how many beds are in each bedroom to whether there's a swing

ask. 
</P>
<P>
 One particularly intriguing program involves renting a gite . Popular among 
the French themselves, the network offers inexpensive (about $300-$600 a week) 
country houses that meet standards set by the government-run Gites Ruraux de 
France. They tend to be several miles outside town, are more simply furnished 
than agency properties and usually don't have a pool (a popular amenity that 
drives up rates). 
</P>
<P>
 French vacationers pick up catalogues listing the properties in detail, then 
simply call the owners and arrange a rental. Americans can do the same, but 
obtaining the catalogues in the U.S. can be difficult, and non-French speakers 
are at a disadvantage. I found it easier to use the program's U.S. 
representative, the French Experience (370 Lexington Ave., Suite 812, New York, 
N.Y. 10017; tel. 212-986-1115). They charge $20 to find a gite that meets your 
needs. (One drawback: They don't provide photographs.) 
</P>
<P>
 A rental car is essential for most home rentals. If you're staying in France 
three weeks or longer, it's often cheaper to lease a new car from a 
manufacturer such as Renault. The French Government Tourist Office (9454 
Wilshire Blvd., Suite 715, Beverly Hills 90212, tel. 900-990-0040 (50 a minute) 
can provide a list of sources. PAMELA THOMAS

LACKING A BUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first time we visited Two Bunch (a.k.a. Two Much) Palms, we too, felt 
great. The novelty wears thin on subsequent returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Having just returned, I read with interest your article ("Weekend Escape," May 
1). My husband and I have visited the resort many times. This was our last. 
</P>
<P>
 We found the resort greatly overpriced. A room that costs $278 and features 
run-down furnishings, shower with cold water only and a hotel staff which seems 
without training, is not competitive with similarly priced hotels. Our lunch 
featured dried-out pieces of turkey with stale bread. Three people left 
messages for us; we received only one.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the massages were wonderful, we don't think the spa can 
overcompensate for the weak accommodations. Did the author of the article get 
special fares?

 Being of Chinese descent I found Amanda Stinchecum's article ("A World Away," 
May 22) truthful and precise. Her descriptions brought back numerous memories 
of Hong Kong and Lamma Island. Comparing her visual journey to my own, I can 
see that appreciation for new places and events is still common ground among 
travelers.

 "Airline Menus Are Lightening Up" by Kathleen Doheny (April 24) omitted any

 I have made several trips to Great Britain over the last several years. On 
every occasion the American food placed on board at LAX has been unappetizing

absolutely delicious. On each occasion fellow travelers remarked on the 
difference.

 Your otherwise excellent article on Tahiti (May 22) refers to the owners of

computer spell-checker didn't object doesn't make it right.

<TEXT>
<P>
 * LAFAYETTE SQUARE: Directed the city engineer and the Department of 
Transportation to initiate proceedings to close the entrances from Venice 
Boulevard to the LaFayette Square neighborhood to deter criminal activity such 
as drug purchases. The following entrances from Venice Boulevard will be closed 
at these streets: Victoria Avenue, Wellington Road, Buckingham Road and 
LaFayette Road. The plan, which was requested by the residents of LaFayette 
Square, also calls for the installation of a traffic light at Crenshaw 
Boulevard and St. Charles Place. The LaFayette Square neighborhood is bounded, 
roughly, by Crenshaw Boulevard on the east, Venice Boulevard on the north, 
Lafayette Road on the west and St. Charles Place on the south. 
</P>
<P>
 * GETTY HOUSE: Authorized the Getty House Restoration Foundation to conduct 
fund-raising events and accept donations to help finance the remodeling and 
refurbishment of Getty House, the official mayor's residence. Once restored, 
the Hancock Park house is to be used to host city receptions and other civic 
functions. Mayor Richard Riordan declined to make the house his residence upon 
his election last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * EL SERENO CENTER: Approved an agreement between the Los Angeles Board of 
Recreation and Parks and the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and 
Recreation that will earmark slightly more than $3 million for building of an 
indoor pool and renovating the baseball field at El Sereno Recreation Center. 
The project is one of 10 throughout the county to be financed with money coming 
from the Los Angeles County 1992 Parks Act. 
</P>
<P>
 * CONSERVATION CORPS: Authorized the Los Angeles Conservation Corps to 
continue leasing former Fire Station No. 7, at 2824 S. Main St., at a rate of 
$1 a year for the next 10 years. Founded in 1986, the corps employs city youths 
who provide such services as graffiti removal and neighborhood cleanup. HOW 
THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues.  
</P>
<P>
 * SEXUAL HARASSMENT: Recommended that Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. 
Williams institute several new polices regarding sexual harassment within his 
ranks. Among the recommendations was the establishment of an independent 
civilian unit to investigate complaints of sexual harassment and to develop a 
comprehensive written policy concerning the problem. Current LAPD written 
policies on the subject are limited to a few paragraphs scattered in sections 
of the department's training manual. Passed 13-0. Voting yes: Richard Alatorre, 
Mike Hernandez, Mark Ridley-Thomas, Rita Walters, Jackie Goldberg, Rudy 
Svorinich Jr.. Absent: Nate Holden. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

STAGE WATCH: ANOTHER WAY FOR THEATER CORP.? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Things may look grim for Theatre Corp. of America, but David Houk, the 
company's president, plans to rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pasadena-based company, which produces the seasons at Pasadena Playhouse 
and the Alex Theatre in Glendale, recently called off tours of its shows to 
three of the four satellite cities where they had been presented. 
</P>
<P>
 Theatre Corp. also laid off 44 of its 130 permanent employees, including the 
two senior vice presidents who were directly responsible for programming the 
Playhouse (Deborah Dixon) and the Alex (Martin Wiviott). 
</P>
<P>
 But the programming at the Playhouse and the Alex will go on, say Theatre 
Corp. officials -- although there may be changes in some of the announced 
titles. And Houk said last week his "personal goal" is to be back on track, 
once again touring Pasadena and Alex shows to just as many cities, by next 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 How does he plan to do this? By re-structuring the deal that governs his 
company's ownership and operation of the Pasadena Playhouse in order to allow 
more freedom to raise private capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The current deal is complicated. The playhouse is owned by a limited 
partnership led by Houk, which leases it to the city of Pasadena, which 
sub-leases it to the nonprofit Pasadena Playhouse State Theatre of California, 
Inc., which hires Houk's Theatre Corp. to operate it. 
</P>
<P>
 When the deal was being hammered out in the '80s, it was set up "to insure 
that the city would get back the property if it didn't work out," said Pasadena 
city attorney Victor Kaleta last week. At that time, Houk had no track record 
of producing shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Houk has a track record. But the structure of the deal "does make it 
difficult for him to finance" his operations, Kaleta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Houk hopes the board of the nonprofit will approve his restructuring plan at a 
meeting Monday, and that the city will approve it within a month. Prospects for 
this are "favorable," speculated Kaleta last week, because "there is a lot of 
good will" toward Theatre Corp. among Pasadena city officials -- assuming, that 
is, that the city won't have to violate its "fiduciary responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 After that, Houk said he plans to make a private offering of stock in his 
corporation. He wants to raise several million dollars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the restructuring plan were not available at press time. But Houk 
said he should have tried to restructure sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the restrictions of the current deal, Houk cited the Jan. 17 
earthquake as another reason Theatre Corp. has had to pull back. The box office 
for the shows that were up then, "Joined at the Head" and "Sayonara," "came to 
a dead stop" for 10 days after the earthquake. Houk "guesstimated" a 
$300,000-$500,000 loss as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 Houk said he is "satisfied with the work everyone has done" at Theatre Corp. 
Layoffs are simply "to save money," and he'd be willing to bring Dixon and 
Wiviott back at some point. Although some shows were better than others, "we've 
never put on anything that embarrassed me," and he has no plans to push the 
programming in the direction of safer revivals. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's second-in-command, executive vice president and chief operating 
officer Lars Hansen, will do the work Dixon and Wiviott had been doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Poway Center for the Performing Arts has survived as the only member of the 
Theatre Corp. touring circuit because Poway managers "have agreed to help with 
rent postponement and some of the operating costs," Houk said. 
</P>
<P>
 IN TENT: Another company affected by the Jan. 17 quake, Actors Alley, plans to 
set up a tent for its its next round of three plays. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake occurred just as Actors Alley was about to re-open El Portal Theatre 
in North Hollywood. The old theater was hard hit. The troupe presented two 
shows this spring at Valley College. But next season will take place in a 
99-seat tent on the grounds of the TV Academy, across Lankershim Blvd. from El 
Portal.

SOUND & VISION: ANTI-ABUSE TOOL CLIP TAKES NO PRISONERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, Chris Willman's Sound & Vision column appears periodically in 
Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Child-beating has been dealt with before in pop music (Suzanne Vega's "Luka" 
and 10,000 Maniacs' "What's the Matter Here" come to immediate mind), but child 
sexual abuse is a more bitter pill to swallow musically. The uncompromising 
hard-rock band Tool has taken it on, though, in its "Prison Sex" video, which 
takes no prisoners in exploring the darkest of all possible worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 Tool's unnerving clip tops this edition of Sound & Vision, in which recent 
music videos are reviewed and rated on a 0-100 scale. Incidentally, there's 
more child abuse -- of a sort -- happening at the bottom of this round-up as 
well. In Aerosmith's "Crazy" clip, the message left for the impressionable 
target audience seems to be that high school girls can (and, perhaps, 
implicitly, should) use their nubile young bodies to wield sexual power over 
older men. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tool video condemns child abuse; the Aerosmith video virtually practices 
it. Ironic, or what? 
</P>
<P>
 Tool, "Prison Sex." Absolutely the creepiest music video since Metallica's 
"One," if not creepier. Tool's metallic meditation on the evils of child abuse, 
told from the point of view of a perpetrator ("My lamb and martyr, this will be 
over soon; you look so precious"), is accompanied by spooky stop-motion 
animation that symbolically but graphically illustrates the torment of a 
sexually abused child. 
</P>
<P>
 A small, porcelain-like figure -- cracked, broken in two, imprisoned -- is 
fondled at uncomfortable length by the long, sinewy fingers of a tall, black, 
alien-like figure that could have emerged out of the sinister imagination of H. 
R. Giger. 
</P>
<P>
 At times some of the effects -- like a moving, animate eyeball inside an 
otherwise hard and inanimate figure -- recall the avant-garde film work of the 
Quay brothers. But this clip's director, Tool guitarist Adam Jones -- who was 
trained in filmic special effects -- seems to have a style of his own. It's not 
a style that most MTV viewers will take to, but it does have a point of view, 
however disturbing. And those who pay close attention to the hard-to-follow 
lyrics and harder-to-follow video narrative will discover that "Prison Sex" is 
actually about a cycle of abuse ("Do unto others what has been done to you"), 
which makes it all the more stomach-turning -- and queasily fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
 79 
</P>
<P>
 Pavement, "Cut Your Hair." And now for something completely different. This 
spring's alternative darlings go in for a collective trim, plopping down in the 
local barber's chair one by one, with successively surreal and unaccountably 
funny results even as no hair actually gets shorn. One member of the quartet, 
for example, gets crowned king when he sits in the special chair, but the video 
cuts to a close-up of a tear rolling down from one eye, a la that old public 
service announcement with the weeping American Indian. The gags are never what 
you expect, and the offbeat visual punch lines pull their punches; this is 
absurdism at its uncut finest. 
</P>
<P>
 75 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Jackson, "Anytime, Anyplace." We've heard of navel-gazing, but Jackson's 
preoccupation with documenting her own belly-button is getting beyond the point 
of curiousness. Her inverse achievements -- the less ample waist, the more 
ample cleavage -- are once again on proudly rampant display in this nicely shot 
clip, which takes place in one of those mythical apartment buildings that's 
terribly dingy yet lit in the most beautifully aphrodisiacal hues of red and 
blue. Jackson spies on a fellow apartment dweller through her keyhole, then 
sneaks over each night for a steamy series of secret trysts that may or may not 
be fantasies. Zalman King, eat your soft-core heart out. 
</P>
<P>
 57 
</P>
<P>
 Green Day, "Longview." Generation X-ers, arise and attack your couches! That's 
the message at the finale of this video starring Green Day, a very "new wave" 
band currently successfully passing for punk. The clothes, the geeky posture, 
the sneering into a wide-angle lens -- these had seemed to go the way of all 
flesh 15 years ago, but perhaps each new generation of rock youth will get its 
own reconstitution of disaffection and snideness after all. But is the singer's 
climactic attack on his own furniture a symbolic assault on couch potato-dom, 
or just reflection of the fact that even Green Day knows guitar-smashing has 
already been done to death? 
</P>
<P>
 56 
</P>
<P>
 Pink Floyd, "Take It Back." Some sweet apocalyptic day, sings Floyd's David 
Gilmour, "she will take it back" -- she being the Earth itself, in this 
instance. Hot lava, angry geysers and other natural phenomena have their way 
with the man-made world; flowers and fauna rise up through cracks in the 
pavement. It's "The Revenge of Koyaanisqatsi." 
</P>
<P>
 This ironic ecological reclamation might not be such a bad idea for a song and 
video if (a) another David, Byrne, hadn't already written a much funnier 
version of the same scenario with Talking Heads' "Nothing but Flowers," and (b) 
the stock nature footage mixed in with the special effects didn't make this 
video look much cheaper than it undoubtedly was. 
</P>
<P>
 51 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah McLachlan, "Possession." McLachlan seems to be this season's 
Pre-Raphaelite sex goddess of choice, a slightly ethereal-looking poetess who 
promises to throw you down on the floor after winning you over with some light 
verse. She's got a gorgeous voice, but this video is unbecomingly obvious in 
its come-on, with McLachlan gazing all too seductively into the camera, 
open-mouthed, less like the artiste she's being positioned as than like a 
posturing, perfume-selling supermodel. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse yet is the silly filming technique: studio performance footage all 
scratched up and artificially faded in post-production. If premature aging of 
film stock is meant to subliminally signify classic , it doesn't work. Ironic, 
that so many filmmakers would be working to preserve the great old movies from 
wear and tear while artsy music video directors are busy inflicting faux 
scratches on brand new work. 
</P>
<P>
 47 
</P>
<P>
 Ice Cube, "You Know How We Do It." At last, a video that shows gangsta rappers 
do have traditional values. Here, Cube and his buds make their money the 
old-fashioned way -- by motoring to Vegas and, of course, hitting it big in 
Glitter Gulch, filmed lovingly from in and around the rapper's shiny, 
neon-reflecting convertible. American to the core, Cube is, after all. (If only 
the rapper had thought to sample Albert Brooks in "Lost in America" singing his 
would-be jingle, The Desert Inn has heart, the Desert Inn has heart, this might 
be a small masterpiece of pathetic consumerism.) 
</P>
<P>
 45 
</P>
<P>
 Mariah Carey, "Without You." It's hard to listen to Harry Nilsson's 1972 hit 
version of this wrenching ballad and not think of the suicide of the 
songwriter, Badfinger's Pete Ham. What might otherwise have read as a typical 
love-song cliche -- "I can't live, if living is without you" -- seemed scarily 
literal, given the real-life context. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey, God bless her, turns it back into a cliche. Her reading of this suicide 
note is all friendly high notes and showy melisma, without even the faint 
comprehending whiff of desperation. The video, a live concert rendering, even 
has a big backing gospel-type chorus sympathetically joining in on the key 
lines -- when the song so clearly demands that its singer be imagined alone and 
forlorn beyond consolation. Remember the days when the great crooners used to 
listen to songs before interpreting them? 
</P>
<P>
 27 
</P>
<P>
 Aerosmith, "Crazy." When it comes to providing the nation's youth with 
beyond-bad role modeling, Aerosmith and director Marty Callner are crazy like a 
fox. This is their third successive video in which the leading role has been 
handed over to the same rascally teen-girl heroine, with random footage of the 
band in concert cut in for good measure. The group and Callner assume -- 
probably astutely -- that when marketing a group of nearly-50-year-olds chiefly 
to not-quite-20-year-olds, 'tis better to have any romantic scenarios doled out 
to actual thespians closer to the target demographic, and have the band act as 
mere Greek chorus. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme this time: sluttishness rules . The lass from the last two clips 
crawls out of her parochial school window, ditches her white and plaid duds, 
and joins an equally Lolita-esque pal in a convertible. Thelma & Louise Jr. 
stop at a gas station and wiggle so efficiently that the attendants let them 
shoplift half the store, then go participate in an erotic dancing contest at a 
bar they're presumably several years too young to get into, then go 
skinny-dipping with a farm worker. It's the most shameless imaginable video 
jailbait.

 Andy Warhol almost got it right. In the future, everyone gets his or her own 
tribute album, evidenced by this 11-artist nod to the not-entirely-timeless 
Simmons & Stanley songbook, though it'd take a perverse palate to claim the 
KISS boys were ever anything more than perfunctory writers (Gene Simmons likes 
to claim all "rock" music is throwaway trash -- spin control if ever we heard 
it). 
</P>
<P>
 Among those hewing yawningly close to the period-piece originals are the Gin 
Blossoms, Anthrax, Extreme and the Lemonheads (whose stoopidly faithful 
"Plaster Caster" is fitting, given Evan Dando's anachronistic eagerness to 
speak up on the subject of groupies). Lenny Kravitz is at least well-suited to 
shift "Deuce" from one '70s sub-genre to another, though he runs out of ideas 
-- and of song -- a minute in.

 There are curiosities. An unrecognizable Garth Brooks does "Hard Luck Woman" 
under the very funny delusion that he's Rod Stewart. Dinosaur Jr. achieves the 
heppest transfer, transforming "Goin' Blind" -- one of KISS' typical 
underage-girl anthems -- into pure Angst with the updated line "I'm 93, you're 
16." 
</P>
<P>
 Toad the Wet Sprocket, too, attempts major cheek by interpreting "Rock and 
Roll All Nite" as a wistful mid-tempo ballad, which sounds way more amusing 
than it turns out. Maybe they'll fare better playing "We're an American Band" 
for pathos on the inevitable Grand Funk tribute.

AT AGE 15, NUXHALL GREW UP IN A HURRY; THE YOUNGEST-EVER PITCHER IN MAJORS 
BROKE IN 50 YEARS AGO AGAINST MUSIAL 
</P>

<P>
 Fifty years ago, a stocky kid made history with a terrifying major league 
debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Nuxhall was 15 years old when he came in to pitch the final inning of a 
game against the St. Louis Cardinals. No one had ever played in the National or 
American League at such a young age; no one has since. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder his knees wobbled. Can you imagine being 15 years old and pitching 
to Stan Musial? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was June 10, 1944. Four days after D-Day. Newspaper headlines scream that 
U.S. planes have sunk four Japanese destroyers. The war seeps into every corner 
of American life, including the national pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball teams are scavenging to fill draft-depleted rosters. Taking up the 
slack are a lot of has-beens and never-weres, players coming out of retirement 
and others coming out of semi-pro leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 One has just come from junior high. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Nuxhall has finished school for the summer and become a part-time major 
leaguer. He dresses for some of Cincinnati's home games -- they're called the 
Redlegs during the war -- and sits on the bench as a reserve pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 What a lark just to be here! 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in awe," he said. "I can't think of anything else I would have been." 
</P>
<P>
 How did he get here? The war opened the door for him, and luck pushed him 
through it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Redlegs had scouted his dad a year earlier. Orville Nuxhall was a 
right-handed pitcher in a Sunday league in nearby Hamilton, Ohio. Joe pitched 
for the team, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just looking for people who had ability," Nuxhall said. "My dad 
could throw hard. They were really scouting him. Almost by accident, they found 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Redlegs liked Joe. Left-handed pitcher. Threw an 85 m.p.h. fastball. Big 
for his age -- 6-foot-3, 190 pounds or so. Local kid. Good publicity. Need 
players. Why not? 
</P>
<P>
 Nuxhall's parents wouldn't let him sign in 1943. A year later, they agreed. As 
soon as school let out, he could have this incredible dream. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't have a razor or a breaking pitch, but Joe Nuxhall was going to be a 
major leaguer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still playing for a junior high school team and all of a sudden, that one 
day here I am," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was just a glorified spectator, but that was fine with him. Besides, it was 
safer in the dugout, especially the way the Cardinals were hitting this sultry 
Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 They were the best team of '44, headed for their third straight World Series. 
They showed it by rolling to a 13-0 lead through eight innings. A bunch of 
wartime backups was closing it out for the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Bill McKechnie decided it was a good situation to see what the kid 
could do. Nuxhall had no inkling it was coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of in awe of these guys, the way they were hitting line drives," 
Nuxhall said. "I was just sitting there watching the Cardinals beat up on the 
Reds when, geez, all of a sudden McKechnie yells at me to warm up." 
</P>
<P>
 He reacted like a teen-ager asked to do the impossible in front of thousands 
of people. He got up, got scared and fell on his face -- first literally, than 
figuratively. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuxhall grabbed his glove and headed for the bullpen in a panic. As he reached 
the top step of the dugout, his borrowed cleats -- he had to use a friend's 
pair because he had none -- caught awkwardly. 
</P>
<P>
 Down he went in front of 3,510 fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared to death," he said. "I got all shook up and tripped over the top 
step and fell flat on my face in the dirt. It was embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
 He got up, dusted off and tried to get his fastball -- average by major league 
standards -- cranked up to full speed in the bullpen. The eighth inning ended. 
It was show time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember warming up, but I can't remember walking from the bullpen to the 
mound," Nuxhall said. "I guess I was scared out of my wits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably two weeks prior to that, I was pitching against seventh-, eighth- 
and ninth-graders, kids 13 and 14 years old. All of a sudden, I look up and 
there's Stan Musial and the likes. It was a scary situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Stunningly, it started all right. He got leadoff batter George (Flash) Fallon 
to ground out. He walked the pitcher, Mort Cooper, but got Augie Bergamo to pop 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait a minute! Kids don't do this to big leaguers! 
</P>
<P>
 "That must have been when I realized where I was at," Nuxhall said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was trying to concentrate on the next batter, Debs Garms, when he glanced 
at the on-deck hitter. There was Musial, the defending NL batting champion, 
getting ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, no! 
</P>
<P>
 Nuxhall knew he had to get out Garms, a former batting champion. He couldn't. 
Nuxhall was so weak-kneed at this point that he completely lost his control and 
walked him. 
</P>
<P>
 "By that time I was all over the place. It wasn't two inches outside, it was 
high and inside, high and outside, bouncing pitches," Nuxhall said. "When he 
walked up there, I guess he thought I was a needle threader. My first pitch he 
just lined to right. Hit it hard." 
</P>
<P>
 It was only a single, but it made Nuxhall feel like a boy among men. He walked 
three more, threw a wild pitch and gave up another hit -- five runs in all -- 
before McKechnie visited the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe he said, 'Joe, that's enough,"' Nuxhall said. 
</P>
<P>
 That thought had occurred to a few others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those people that were at Crosley Field that afternoon probably said, 'Well, 
that's the last we'll see of that kid,' " Nuxhall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only for a while. A few days later, the Redlegs shipped him to the minors. 
Eight years later, he was back with the Reds. This time, he had a nasty slider 
and a lot of confidence to go with the fastball. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nuxhall did better in later confrontations with Musial, although the 
seven-time batting champion ruined one more of his milestone moments. On 
opening day in 1956, Musial hit a two-out, two-run homer off Nuxhall for a 4-2 
win. It was Nuxhall's only opening day start. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuxhall stayed in the majors through 1966, going 135-117 with a 3.90 career 
ERA. He was voted into the Reds' Hall of Fame and has been a Reds radio 
announcer for the past 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's the only one who can boast that he got to face Stan Musial as a 
15-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you think of all the individuals that played at the major league level 
and you're the youngest in the history of the game and in the Guinness Book of 
Records, it does make you in awe of it," Nuxhall said. "The only thing is I 
just wish it would have been a better performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the heck, I was a 15-year-old kid. I guess the one thing, when I look 
back, is I wish I'd have gotten the third out without any runs being scored. 
That would have made it a heck of a lot better."

MICHAEL JORDAN LEARNS THE RULES OF RHUBARB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEN WALKER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Early April, early innings. Michael Jordan is called out on a close pitch, and 
he doesn't like it. 
</P>
<P>
 He stomps around the batter's box, goes face-to-face with umpire Andy 
Fletcher, and angrily flings his bat toward the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 Mid-May, middle innings. Jordan is called out -- again by Fletcher -- for 
sliding out of the basepath trying to break up a double play. The interference 
ruling with the bases loaded is a big one, and Birmingham Barons manager Terry 
Francona goes crazy and gets ejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan, however, stays cool. Instead, at the end of the inning, as he runs 
past the umpire on his way to right field, he stops and calmly says, "Andy, I'm 
6-foot-6. I think I can reach the bag from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher patiently points out he doesn't think so, and that's it. No waving 
arms, no going wild. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the problem early in the season was that Michael didn't know how to 
argue with an umpire," said Brian King, Fletcher's partner on the two-man 
Southern League crew. "He's gotten much better at it." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been a lot of things for Jordan to learn this year in his quest to 
become a baseball player, and how to jaw with the ump is one of them. It's not 
like the NBA, where he got superstar treatment from the officials, it was 
explained early. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him you can't try to show me up or make a scene every time," Fletcher 
said. "Then I said something to Terry." 
</P>
<P>
 "Andy said there was a problem and that I needed to fix it," Francona said. "I 
appreciated that. That was the right way to do it, I think, to let the manager 
deal with a problem with one of his players. I thought Andy and Brian showed a 
good understanding of the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Next, Francona took aside Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really remember what I said. It wasn't much," Francona said. "I think 
we just talked about umpires and the job they do and dealing with them." 
</P>
<P>
 King said he's seen the improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "He uses our names now when he argues. He didn't do that before," he said. 
"There's nothing wrong with him questioning a call. There's just a right way 
and a wrong way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 To Jordan, it's how the umpire handles himself that matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always try to get along with officials," he said. "Sometimes, they won't 
let you. They build a wall when they won't admit they're wrong. I admit I am 
wrong, when I am wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the great things about Jake O'Donnell was he could say, 'I blew it.' I 
can respect a man for that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell, a prominent NBA referee, was a former baseball umpire. In the 
Southern League, in fact, on a crew with Bill Kunkel. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan, however, was the one admitting a mistake recently. It happened after 
that play in which he was called out for sliding wide of the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the film the next day, and I was out," Jordan said. "That night, I went 
up and apologized to Fletcher and told him I was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Marv Wright and Randy Wagner, another Southern League crew, have seen the 
difference in Jordan's demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called him out on a steal play early this year in Carolina, and he jumped 
up and was in my face," Wagner said. "I called him out on strikes twice 
recently and I don't think he liked the calls, but he didn't say anything and 
went back to the dugout." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright said that even if Jordan doesn't hoot on a call, the umpires are sure 
to hear it from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he's batting and it's a close pitch and you call it a ball, people think 
you're just giving it to him because he's Michael Jordan," he said. "But if you 
call it a strike, they think you're sticking it to him because of who he is." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright said there's one thing Jordan quickly picked up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, when a player is in his first year, he always calls us 'blue.' As 
in, 'Hey blue, that pitch was low.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But not once has Michael called us 'blue.' He's learning our names."

COMMENTARY; KNEE INJURY SENT EISENHOWER TOWARD D-DAY AND PRESIDENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE KINDRED, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>

<P>
 On the Kansas prairie at the turn of the century, a boy hopped freight trains 
to get to the next ballgame. He learned to hunt and cook his kill from an 
illiterate woodsman who also taught him to paddle a flatboat, to find north on 
a rainy day and never to try to draw to an inside straight. When a doctor 
wanted to amputate his infected leg, the boy, then 13, stopped him by saying, 
"I'd rather be dead than crippled and not able to play ball." 
</P>
<P>
 He grew up in Abilene, once a dusty cow town that hired Wild Bill Hickok as 
its marshal. The boy, blond and blue-eyed, handsome as a sunrise and quick with 
a smile already irresistible, made a striking appearance when he left Abilene, 
20 years old, headed east for school. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had filled out in the past two years, putting on 20 pounds, none of which 
was fat," a biographer wrote. "At nearly 6 feet tall, and weighing 170 pounds, 
with strong, broad shoulders and rock-hard muscles, he was the embodiment of an 
athlete. He was rawboned, with big hands. He walked on the balls of his feet 
and carried himself gracefully, as good athletes do." 
</P>
<P>
 His daydreams had been a boy's of his time and place. Maybe, he said, he could 
be a railroad engineer "racing across the land, arriving in Abilene, steam 
engine hissing, bell ringing, once again breaking the record from St. Louis or 
some other distant, mythical place." 
</P>
<P>
 Or a baseball pitcher: " . . . to set down the next three batters on nine 
pitches in the last half of the ninth, with the bases loaded (of course) to the 
thunderous applause of five hundred spectators." 
</P>
<P>
 And this: "When I was a small boy in Kansas, a friend of mine and I went 
fishing, and as we sat there in the warmth of a summer afternoon on a river 
bank, we talked about what we wanted to do when we grew up. I told him that I 
wanted to be a real major league baseball player, a genuine professional like 
Honus Wagner. My friend said that he'd like to be president of the United 
States. Neither of us got our wish." 
</P>
<P>
 The Abilene of Dwight David Eisenhower's youth was a conservative, 
God-fearing, hard-working place where you made your life yourself. One of six 
brothers of a father who used the rod and a mother who gave them a sense of 
peace, Eisenhower worked constantly. His money went for shotgun shells, ice 
cream sodas and, most of all, for bats, balls, gloves and uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Historian Stephen F. Ambrose wrote, "Sports, especially football and baseball, 
were the center of his life. He put more time into the games than into anything 
else, save work, and expended far more energy on sports than he put into his 
studies. He was a good, but not outstanding, athlete. He was well coordinated, 
but slow of foot. He weighed only 150 pounds. His chief asset was his will to 
win." 
</P>
<P>
 Ambrose saw in Eisenhower humility and fair play: "One Saturday afternoon, the 
Abilene players discovered that the opposition had a Negro on the team. Each 
Abilene player refused to play across the line from the Negro, who was a 
center. Dwight stepped forward to say that he would play center that day, 
although his usual position was end and he had never played center. Both before 
and after the game, Dwight shook hands with the Negro. 'Rest of the team was a 
bit ashamed (of themselves),' he reported years later." 
</P>
<P>
 Military history fascinated the ballplayer. His senior yearbook predicted 
Eisenhower would become a professor of history at Yale. Though his appointment 
to the U.S. Military Academy in 1911 was a surprise to a young boy up from 
nothing, a generation later it must have seemed ordained. 
</P>
<P>
 At West Point as at Abilene, sports was so much his passion that even 
Eisenhower admitted "it would be difficult to overemphasize" the importance he 
attached to games. His first year, he played baseball and junior varsity 
football. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happened later, and much would happen, Eisenhower never forgot 1912. 
That second year as an Army cadet, he became a football star described by The 
New York Times as "one of the most promising backs in Eastern football." For 
years he told friends, with delight, of tackling Jim Thorpe and believing he 
had hurt the Carlisle Indian School star only to see him rise up and on the 
next play run through Army again. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in a mid-November game against Tufts, Eisenhower twisted a knee. During 
a horsemanship exercise a week later, he crumpled in agony. Cartilages and 
tendons were torn. He never played again. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, even as he rose in rank to major, he worked as a football coach at 
Army camps. Through the 1920s and into the '30s, Eisenhower coached at San 
Antonio, Fort Sam Houston, St. Louis College, Camp Meade and Fort Benning. His 
work attracted such attention that he once turned down a job as head coach at 
"a northwestern university." 
</P>
<P>
 The biographer Ambrose: " . . . coaching brought out his best traits -- his 
organizational ability, his energy and competitiveness, his enthusiasm and 
optimism, his willingness to work hard at a task that intrigued him, his powers 
of concentration, his talent for working with the material he had . . . and his 
gift for drawing the best out of his players." 
</P>
<P>
 In memoirs done after his years of triumph, Eisenhower said football "tends to 
instill in men the feeling that victory comes through hard -- almost slavish -- 
work, team play, self-confidence, and an enthusiasm that amounts to 
dedication." He could reel off names of generals and admirals who had the game 
in common. They were men who understood sacrifice for a goal greater than 
themselves. They also understood their debt and obligation to men whose 
sacrifices made their lives worth living. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years ago this week, the old ballplayer from Kansas stood in the mess 
room at Southwick House, an estate near the southern coast of England. As 
supreme commander of the Allied forces in World War II, he had a decision to 
make. The only sounds in the room were rain against the windows and French 
doors rattling in the storm winds. Sometime after 4 in the morning, Eisenhower 
said quietly but clearly, "OK, let's go." 
</P>
<P>
 Then began the greatest invasion in the history of warfare.

TENNIS / ELLIOTT ALMOND; MAYBE THE IMAGE IS EVERYTHING

<P>
 Almost anyone who has swung a racquet during the French Open the past two 
weeks has been queried about the state of their sport. The questions have been 
legitimate, what with the women's game missing Monica Seles and any element of 
drama. Even Mary Pierce's ascent at Roland Garros does little to ensure the 
game's resurrection until she proves her mettle over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 The image of the men's game also is suffering although this Grand Slam 
tournament has given us some new faces to talk about. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is nice. Because, really, it is becoming tiresome listening to some of 
the old hands. 
</P>
<P>
 In this category, Jim Courier, the avowed new man, ranks No. 1. No one can 
criticize his powerful, determined game. He is a lovely player whose work ethic 
is unsurpassed. 
</P>
<P>
 But his boorish behavior off the court only hurts the game that has given him 
so much. He claims to have brought a "sunny new disposition" to Paris this 
year, but mostly he has been his taciturn self. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning his second French Open two years ago, Courier was asked by a 
young local radio reporter to speak French for her audience. After all, Courier 
had just thanked the Center Court crowd for their support in French, and prides 
himself on his language skill. But he was defiant in refusing her simple 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 He acts as if the world is against him, and such an attitude does little to 
enhance the game that could use some help. He has been telling us that he has 
changed, and is much happier because of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided I was tried of being the angry young man," said Courier, who lost 
to Sergi Bruguera of Spain in Friday's semifinals. "I've let the mask down and 
shown the real person. This is the way I am." 
</P>
<P>
 But it seems he is struggling with this nice-guy image as caustic remarks 
continue to lace his interview sessions. And that's too bad for a game that is 
trying to sustain interest and develop personalities. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Andrei Medvedev of the Ukraine is a rising star who is proof that for all the 
game's flaws, tennis remains a fun and intriguing sport. He wears a mischievous 
smile that endears him to the younger fans. He actually looks as if he enjoys 
himself during matches. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 20-year-old must be careful not to follow many of the big-named stars, 
who seem to let fame and fortune go to their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Medvedev lacks Courier's training ethic and maturity, but not his oracle 
skills.So, when he was asked about his sport, it was like listening to a leaky 
faucet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know all the guys, every guy has charisma and personality, and you just 
don't look at it," he chided reporters last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people are blaming us for not smiling and for not showing character. But 
unfortunately the sport is not as easy as it looks. Everyone serves more than 
180 kilometers (about 108 m.p.h.) an hour; just once try to return that serve, 
you will understand why we are not smiling." 
</P>
<P>
 Medvedev continued: "I would like to make jokes. (But) you don't have to take 
me as a clown. I am not here to entertain you. If I lose, I will not try to 
make a tragedy or act like a loser. I would actually try to (play so) people 
would still enjoy the game. For them, it is a show, I understand that. For us, 
it's a job." 
</P>

 Michael Chang, who has never been able to repeat the magic that brought him 
fame when he won the 1989 French Open at age 17, has along with top-ranked Pete 
Sampras brought a dignity to the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang's perspective on tennis' ills: 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like team sports, you take each localized city and they are able to 
relate to a team. Tennis is so much an individual sport. Tennis has been 
brought up in such a way that it is so much a gentleman's sport that it is very 
difficult to get away from traditional ideas and traditional ways of presenting 
a match."

 "The way they market it is so much of an energy type of thing, they are 
showing the dunks and stuff like that," Chang said.

 Chang also noted that although tennis is losing some interest in the United 
States, it is booming in Asia, where he is a fan favorite.

 The quality of tennis players is as good as ever. A Courier-Sampras match at a 
Grand Slam tournament has the potential to be as exciting as Borg-McEnroe. 
Perhaps tennis simply is going through a temporary slump, as many officials 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the players seem more aloof, more bent on their own wants. They are young 
millionaires whose lives are skewed by their bubble existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, they have lost their sense of responsibility. Where are the 
ambassadors to replace the Arthur Ashes and Ken Rosewalls? 
</P>
<P>
 If Jim Courier thinks a little proclamation that he has changed is the answer 
he is more gullible than his adoring public. He and his ilk are going to have 
to work as hard off the court as they do on it to change tennis' image. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Andre Agassi was right all along: Image is everything. Tennis Notes

 Jim Courier, who has played in 22 Grand Slam tournaments, was asked to rate 
the sites. Wimbledon is No. 1 in his book, the French Open No. 2, followed by 
the Australian Open and the U.S. Open, which he called a distant fourth. "I 
think I'd rate Court 1 at Wimbledon over the U.S. Open Center Court, actually," 
Courier said . . . Brooke Shields had a tennis connection long before she 
started dating Andre Agassi. Frank Shields, Brooke's grandfather, qualified for 
Wimbledon in the 1920s, but was unable to compete because of an injury. He did 
play in the first round of the U.S. Open but lost.

 Boris Becker, who moved back into the top 10 last month for the first time 
since November, is scheduled to make a rare Southland appearance in the Los 
Angeles Open Aug. 1-7 at UCLA. Becker won titles at Indian Wells in 1987 and 
'88, but the three-time Wimbledon champion has never played in the L.A. Open. 
Among others scheduled to compete are Andre Agassi, who won the tournament in 
1988, and Michael Chang, a finalist in three of the last five years. . . . 
Three "opportunity" tournaments -- July 6-10 at Rancho San Clemente Tennis & 
Fitness Club, July 13-17 at the Beverly Hills Tennis Club and July 20-24 at 
Rancho Valencia Resort -- will send their winners to a qualifying tournament 
for the Toshiba Classic, a WTA event Aug. 1-7 at La Costa.

IS THE STATE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BEING 'FEMINIZED'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 If state Treasurer Kathleen Brown wins the Democratic nomination for governor, 
she will become the fourth woman in three consecutive state elections to emerge 
from a contested Democratic primary with a top-of-the-ticket berth in the 
general. The state Democratic Party's preference for women as standard bearers 
began in 1990, when Dianne Feinstein came from behind to defeat then-Atty. Gen. 
John K. Van de Kamp in the gubernatorial primary. Two years later, she and 
then-Rep. Barbara Boxer won the Democratic senatorial primaries. If the trend 
continues, will California's Democratic Party someday become a "Women's Party"? 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the Democratic preference for women reflects demographics. Women now 
account for about 56% of the party's electorate in California, compared with 
about 53% of the general electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, however, gender has been increasingly seen as a voting cue. Polls 
taken during that year's gubernatorial race indicated that Democratic women 
were far more likely than their male counterparts to prefer a gubernatorial 
candidate of their own sex. The percentage of California voters who told The 
Times Poll they agreed with the statement that "it is time we had a woman 
governor" rose from 40% in 1990 to 52% this year. Among Democrats, 62% agreed 
(compared with 35% of the Republicans). 
</P>
<P>
 Numbers like these have boosted women's issues to the top of the state party's 
agenda. They also help to explain why Brown has managed to retain a consistent 
lead in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 But demographics alone cannot account for the "feminization" of the California 
Democratic Party. Today's political culture has given women clout. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, to be a politician was to be male. The stereotype evoked images 
of an "old boys' network" tainted by special-interest money. In 1992, an 
anti-incumbent backlash helped Democratic women candidates, who outnumbered 
their GOP counterparts, win a huge number of primary and general elections. 
This year, cynicism about politics-as-usual and dissatisfaction with the status 
quo again appear to be electoral themes. Candidates of both major parties are 
running away from any such association. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic women candidates are not only "new" but are also perceived as 
fully capable of playing with the "big boys." Boxer, Feinstein and Brown, for 
example, are proven fund raisers and know their way around politics and 
government. They are subjected to the same special-interest pressures that 
buffet male candidates. But, so far, voters appear more willing to take a 
chance that women won't as easily succumb to them -- up to a point. 
</P>
<P>
 As women become more numerous and visible in positions of power, and begin to 
be perceived as politicians, they could lose that "outsider" appeal. Sen. 
Feinstein may be experiencing a little of that already. Early polls show her in 
a surprisingly close race with her likely GOP opponent, Rep. Michael 
Huffington, a millionaire political novice. After only two years in the harsh 
Washington spotlight, Feinstein's mantle of change seemingly has frayed, 
perhaps accelerated by Huffington's media assault. 
</P>
<P>
 This developing scenario indicates that although women may continue to win 
Democratic primaries, by virtue of demographics and gender issues, they may 
encounter new turbulence in the general election because of the influence of 
other factors on voter decisions. Feinstein, again, offers an object lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of the 1990 gubernatorial campaign, voters were concerned about 
"lifestyle" issues -- education, the environment and abortion rights -- which 
traditionally favor women candidates. This helped Feinstein through the 
primary. Then, as the fall campaign got under way, voters' attention turned to 
a weakening economy and the threat of war in the Persian Gulf, issues that 
traditionally favor male candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to this, partisanship and organization, which usually come into play in a 
general election. The result: Pete Wilson is governor. Feinstein's gender 
advantage had eroded. 
</P>
<P>
 And two years later, Feinstein and Boxer owed their senatorial victories as 
much to party affiliation as to gender: George Bush didn't head their ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, Republican Party politics may also have helped to move women 
toward the Democrats. As one disgruntled activist said, "It was a big mistake 
of the GOP to cede gender politics to the Democrats." The state party's 
repudiation of abortion rights and the Equal Rights Amendment has alienated 
younger, more moderate women. 
</P>
<P>
 If moderate Republican women continue to lose faith in the GOP and its 
candidates, what might that mean for the future of California politics? 
"Polarization," one disaffected activist fears. "Balkanization by gender." 
Perhaps not. But Republicans may be in danger of atrophy -- induced by the 
"machismo-morphisis" of their party. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears, however, that Wilson is moving to make amends and bring moderate 
GOP women home. His nomination of Appeals Court Judge Kathryn M. Werdegar to 
serve as the second woman on the state Supreme Court signals that he 
understands he'll need their support in a close general-election race. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the tendency of women to register Democratic, gender does not appear 
to be playing a decisive role in the party's primaries for lower constitutional 
offices. Perhaps because these mostly ministerial jobs -- controller and 
secretary of state, for example -- have little direct impact on gender-related 
or lifestyle issues, they don't tend to mobilize women as a group. This may 
help explain why Assemblywoman Gwen Moore is trailing two male opponents in the 
race for the Democratic nomination for secretary of state. Yet, polls show 
Kathleen Connell leading her male opponents in the race for the Democratic 
nomination for controller. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Times poll indicates, however, that Connell's edge is not the result 
of a gender gap. Money appears to be as important. Connell has committed her 
own money and has the support of women who can raise more. She's using those 
funds to buy media and name recognition, a sure-fire combination for any 
candidate in a lower-ballot race. 
</P>
<P>
 Will California Democrats someday become a "Women's Party," whose electoral 
fortunes stand or fall on the power of issues and candidates that resonate 
according to gender? Not as long as other constituencies need to be served and 
other factors affect elections up and down the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 What's clear is that the state Democratic Party will continue to enjoy a big 
advantage in terms of women candidates and women voters -- as long as it is 
perceived as the only party to address issues of concern to a large chunk of 
this state's electorate.*

A 'CAPITALIST' CHINA DOES NOT ENSURE A DEMOCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Maurice J. Meisner, Maurice J. Meisner is the Harvey Goldberg Professor of 
History at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. His latest book, Post-Mao 
China: An Inquiry Into the Fate of Chinese Socialism, will be out from Hill & 
Wang later this year. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Bill Clinton's decision to continue China's "most-favored-nation" 
trade status, a favor enjoyed by virtually all nations, was more than a matter 
of economic expedien cy. Coming shortly after a bewil dered Secretary of State 
Warren M. Christopher was embarrassed in Beijing, the President's apparently 
agonized decision was a reluctant but definitive recognition that the United 
States cannot significantly influence the domestic politics of China. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a lesson that should have been learned a half century ago. Had it been 
understood then, it might have prevented what proved to be a futile U.S. 
intervention in the civil war between Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists and Mao 
Tse-tung's Communists, with unhappy consequences for both China and America. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that the lesson is better appreciated than it was before the recent 
(and probably final) MFN debate over China, it would be unwise to embrace the 
opposing view -- that capitalist economic development will produce political 
democracy in China. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the argument, with many variations, offered by those who lobbied in 
favor of preserving China's most-favored-nation status. Prominent among them, 
of course, were U.S. business interests -- including Boeing, IBM and AT&T -- 
that profit handsomely (or anticipate doing so) from trade with and investment 
in China. "Economic engagement," it is self-servingly maintained, is the best 
means to bring about the democratization of China. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, it requires an extraordinary measure of gullibility to believe that 
foreign economic interests have any serious desire to promote democracy in 
China. Foreign capital is attracted to China, in large measure, because the 
country offers the services of a huge labor force that is disciplined, 
comparatively literate and, above all, inexpensive. In addition, the strong 
state guarantees "stability and order" -- ensuring that the labor force remains 
obedient. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, understandably, little enthusiasm for any process of democratization 
that might, say, nurture the establishment of free trade unions for China's 
huge and rapidly expanding industrial work force -- now more than 200 million. 
On the matter of free workers' unions, international capitalism and the Chinese 
Communist Party stand together on common economic ground. To this, the 
Communist Party, haunted since 1980 by "the Polish fear" of the rise of a 
Solidarity-type movement, adds political considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the political direction of the world's most populous country -- which can 
now claim the world's third-largest economy, as well as the most rapidly 
growing one -- will ultimately be determined not by foreign capitalism but 
rather by the workings of its own quasi-capitalist system. And here the 
prospects for some process of democratic evolution are less than promising -- 
not least of all because the peculiar Chinese version of capitalism lacks an 
independent capitalist class, a consequence of its communist origins. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of 1978, when Deng Xiaoping began dismantling the old Soviet-style 
"command economy" in favor of what is now called a "socialist market economy," 
China had no entrepreneurial class. The Chinese bourgeoisie had largely been 
destroyed in the Communist Revolution of 1949, and what remained was gradually 
absorbed by the new state in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 With the decision to pursue economic reform, a class of capitalist 
entrepreneurs thus had to be created to construct a market economy and permit 
that market to function. The task of creating a capitalist class, ironically, 
could be performed only by the communist state itself. And it was, of course, 
bureaucrats of the communist regime who were best positioned to take advantage 
of opportunities the new market mechanisms offered -- and to heed Deng's 
injunction to "get rich." 
</P>
<P>
 It should not be surprising, then, that the new Chinese bourgeoisie (or rural 
and urban "entrepreneurial elites," if one prefers) is not only a creature of 
the communist state and its policies but is actually largely composed of 
party-state officials (or ex-officials), their relatives and friends. While a 
portion of the bourgeoisie is "private" -- not having sprung directly from the 
bureaucracy -- they are, nonetheless, dependent on bureaucratic patronage for 
their existence and economic functioning. 
</P>
<P>
 This dependence is reinforced by the eagerness of the most successful private 
entrepreneurs to join the Communist Party, an organization whose principal 
qualifications for membership are now two: wealth and loyalty to the communist 
regime. It has been noted that China's new capitalists are hostile to popular 
democratic elections, which they fear would be dominated by the country's rural 
majority -- a hostility and fear shared by the Chinese Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unlikely that a democratic political role will be played by a Chinese 
bourgeoisie so dependent on the state -- and indeed so much a part of the 
party-state bureaucracy. It is most improbable that a bourgeoisie whose 
economic fortunes are so dependent on the political fortunes of the communist 
state will mount a serious challenge to the authority of that state. 
</P>
<P>
 Over several generations, it is conceivable that China's new entrepreneurs 
will shed their bureaucratic roots, evolve into a genuinely independent 
bourgeoisie and assert their interests (which may or may not be favorable to 
democracy) against the state. But for the time being, the members of China's 
new capitalist classes -- from rural party cadres turned petty entrepreneurs to 
the sons and daughters of powerful communist leaders wheeling and dealing in 
international finance and trade from high-rise offices in Shenzhen -- appear 
more agents of the state than its antagonists. In fact, they are providing the 
bureaucracy with a lucrative economic base while providing the Communist Party 
with a new social base. 
</P>
<P>
 In playing this dual role, China's capitalists contribute not to "pluralism," 
as most Western observers reflexively assume, but to a further blurring of the 
line between state and society. The history of China's new moneyed elites thus 
far provides little support for the currently fadish notion of an emergent 
"civil society" that strives to separate itself from the clutches of the state. 
Indeed, the new entrepreneurs, having largely sprung from the bureaucracy, are 
psychologically, as well as economically, dependent on the communist state -- 
and rely on that state for political protection. 
</P>
<P>
 While the economic future of Chinese capitalism may be bright, there is little 
reason to expect it will be a politically democratic capitalism. Democratic 
promise in China today resides not in capitalism but rather in the illegal 
union and other organizing activities of those who seek protection from the 
workings of the capitalist market and from the communist state -- the more than 
100 million workers exploited in the burgeoning rural industrial sector, 
workers in state industries threatened with loss of job security and the 
peasants who are again the victims of rapacious officials.*

U.S. LEADERSHIP 50 YEARS LATER; A CERTAINTY IS NOW OPEN TO DOUBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES A. BAKER III, James A. Baker III was the 61st secretary of state. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 50th anniversary of the Normandy landings is an occasion to celebrate one 
of history's greatest military feats and to commemorate the memory of the 
thousands of soldiers -- American and allied -- who died achieving it. 
</P>
<P>
 But the D-day anniversary is also an appropriate time to reflect on American 
leadership -- a leadership that today has been called into doubt as it has not 
since before World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 When, just after midnight on June 6, 1944, U.S. paratroopers of the 101st and 
82nd airborne divisions began landing near the village of Ste Mere-Eglise, 
their action marked a historic landmark: the emergence of the United States as 
the senior partner in the Western Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1944, American preeminence reflected a startling sea-change. During World 
War I, despite our pivotal role in defeating Germany, the United States played 
junior partner to France and Great Britain. Even after our entry into World War 
II -- in December, 1941 -- we continued to defer to Britain, already at war 
with Adolf Hitler's Germany for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 By June, 1944, however, the overwhelming preponderance of U.S. military might 
and industrial production had altered the Anglo-American relationship. Britain 
and our other allies, sometimes at extraordinary sacrifice, would play critical 
roles in final victory over the Axis. But American primacy within the Western 
Alliance was unchallenged. 
</P>
<P>
 It would remain unchallenged -- despite occasional disputes among the allies 
-- through the remainder of World War II and the four decades of the Cold War. 
Now, 50 years after D-day, that American leadership is in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it is not a foreign power that challenges American leadership. 
Indeed, the United States today enjoys both a security and stature unparalleled 
in modern history. Our global adversary of more than 40 years, the Soviet 
Union, is extinct. Its chief successor state, Russia, no longer represents a 
conventional threat to the United States or Western Europe. China, though an 
economic force and regional military power, is as yet incapable of exerting 
influence on a global basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States also has no rivals for leadership among its partners in the 
Western Alliance. Despite economic strength, neither Germany nor Japan is 
prepared, for powerful historical reasons associated with their roles during 
World War II, to assume the mantle of Western leadership. And the European 
Union -- as revealed in the tragicomedy of its policy toward the Balkans -- 
does not possess the unity to assume a leadership role. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, it is U.S. foreign policy itself that has called American global 
leadership into doubt. Granted, there have been some solid foreign-policy 
achievements in the last 18 months. The North American Free Trade Agreement was 
approved -- thanks, in large part, to the personal engagement, however belated, 
of President Bill Clinton. Middle East peace talks achieved a breakthrough with 
the historic Israeli-Palestine Liberation Organization accord -- a development 
inconceivable without U.S. efforts to pave the way. And the Administration has 
steered a staunchly pro-reform and pro-reformer course toward Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, however, U.S. foreign policy is showing signs of disarray and drift 
-- in formulation and implementation. The Administration and its supporters 
argue that the nation confronts a far more complex world than it faced during 
the Cold War. They are right. But that complexity, far from diminishing the 
need for U.S. leadership, increases it. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, U.S. troops finally departed Somalia -- but not before enduring last 
October's tragedy in Mogadishu, a result of an ill-considered shift in U.S. 
objectives. The Administration's Bosnian policy, with its mismatch between 
rhetoric and reality, can be charitably described as confused. With Haiti, the 
Administration has reversed course again and embarked on the latest policy of 
the month. 
</P>
<P>
 On China, the Administration wants to have it both ways. For a year, it 
threatened to end most-favored-nation status if Beijing did not significantly 
improve its human-rights policies. China, of course, did nothing of the sort. 
But the Administration has extended MFN, anyway. And the Administration's 
stance toward North Korea appears to reflect a weakening of the no-compromise 
approach on nuclear non-proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Cold War, U.S. relations with the Soviet Union overshadowed all 
other foreign-policy concerns. Today, in contrast, no single issue possesses 
such salience. Instead, U.S. policy must address a range of issues -- none 
individually decisive but cumulatively representing a test of U.S. interests 
and influence. Similarly, it is the cumulative effect of U.S. foreign policy 
that counts. And that effect, since the Clinton Administration assumed office, 
has been mixed, at best. 
</P>
<P>
 Constant shifts of policies, combined with rhetorical overreach, have rightly 
raised real concerns about U.S. resolve. Policies toward Haiti, Somalia, 
Bosnia, China and North Korea have sent ambiguous signals about America's 
seriousness. As a result, there has been a perceptible erosion of U.S. 
credibility in Europe and elsewhere. That credibility is the coin of U.S. 
influence. Today it is being devalued. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline in U.S. credibility, unless reversed, has three potentially major 
negative effects.  
</P>
<P>
 First is among our allies. Since World War II, U.S. leadership has depended on 
the trust allies could put in America's word and the confidence they felt in 
our commitments. The more our rhetoric diverges from reality, the more that 
trust is undermined. And the more we resort to empty threats, the more that 
confidence is diminished. There is already a murmur of criticism among our 
European allies. Unless action is taken to signal clear U.S. resolve, it could 
become a chorus. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, a perception of U.S. weakness will raise hopes among potential 
adversaries. Last year's fiasco in Port-au-Prince, when a few dozen thugs 
caused the U.S. Navy to turn tail, has plainly emboldened the military regime 
there and made more difficult the task of returning Haiti to representative 
government. An accommodationist line toward North Korea will, similarly, not be 
lost on other would-be proliferators in such capitals as Tripoli, Tehran and 
Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, and perhaps most important, a foreign policy in disarray undermines the 
domestic consensus in support of U.S. engagement abroad. That popular support, 
forged during World War II and sustained -- despite the interruption of Vietnam 
-- in the decades that followed, remains a precondition of effective U.S. 
foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is not isolationist. Its stated foreign-policy objectives 
fall, by and large, within the internationalist tradition that reaches back to 
Franklin D. Roosevelt. Nonetheless, foreign-policy missteps are playing into 
the hands of isolationists of the political left and right. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent poll revealed less than 15% of Americans have a clear idea of the 
country's foreign policy. This is bad news -- not just for the Administration, 
but for U.S. foreign policy. Americans, it seems, are confused just when they 
need to understand most clearly America's stakes in the post-Cold War era.  
</P>
<P>
 The case for U.S. engagement abroad is compelling for any number of political, 
economic and historic reasons. But, as the polls make distressingly clear, the 
Administration has yet to make it. 
</P>
<P>
 As we watch the grainy newsreel footage of Utah and Omaha beaches, we cannot 
avoid being struck by how the world has changed since the summer of 1944. 
Americans of 1944 -- at the front and at home -- possessed a certainty and 
optimism that seem so distant today. The Germany we spent so much blood and 
treasure to defeat 50 years ago is today one of our most trusted allies.  
</P>
<P>
 But one thing remains a constant, then as now: the need for U.S. leadership. A 
half century after D-day, the United States has achieved a unique position of 
power and prestige in world affairs. Attaining that position, as this week's 
anniversary reminds us, took leadership. So, too, will maintaining it.* A

THE NATION; DOES MURDOCH MEAN THE END OF ROMANCE IN MEDIA? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Neal Gabler, Neal Gabler, author of An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews 
Invented Hollywood (Anchor/Doubleday), is now working on a book about columnist 
Walter Winchell.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Media moguls aren't what they used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 With his theft of eight CBS television affiliates two weeks ago, Rupert 
Murdoch elbowed his Fox network into the company of the Big Three and himself 
quite possibly into the pantheon of media giants alongside Louis B. Mayer, 
William Randolph Hearst and William S. Paley -- to name but three legends. Yet, 
one can't help but feel that Murdoch, whose tentacles coil around movies, 
newspapers, television and broadcast satellites, doesn't quite belong in that 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that he is more rapacious than they were -- for the old media 
chieftains were all rapacious; or that he is any more autocratic or even that 
he is less charming, less congenial, less interesting. No, the real difference 
between Murdoch and his media forebears -- the real reason he represents not so 
much a continuation of a tradition of incorrigible scalawags as the end of that 
tradition -- is that he seems so much less romantic . 
</P>
<P>
 Romance, of course, may seem a peculiar word to use with business. U.S. 
history is filled with sordid tales of ruthless robber barons, and even our 
businessmen-heroes are known more for their tenacity than their decency. Media 
kings are no exception. In their day, and even in ours, Mayer, Hearst, Paley 
and the rest were often reviled as profiteering despoilers of the old genteel 
culture rather than as the architects of a new mass culture. 
</P>
<P>
 But the media kings have also come to possess a certain romantic aura that 
steel barons, auto magnates and oil tycoons don't have -- an aura that has only 
grown brighter through our nostalgia for old movies and the yellow press. We 
tend to see them as out-sized buccaneers who bullied their way through society 
selling dreams, purveying values, creating taste and fashion. If not good men, 
they were big men. They were certainly a different kind of businessman from the 
pallid bean-counters who ran other industries. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie moguls were flamboyant Eastern European Jewish immigrants or the 
sons of immigrants. Insecure about their acceptance as Americans, they came to 
the movies not simply for profit. Rather, movies were a way for them to achieve 
their dreams of assimilation. In their movies they created an alternative 
America that idealized the real America; they created their own cinematic 
utopia. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearst, who owned a vast media empire of newspapers, radio stations and a film 
production company, wasn't a struggling immigrant, but his properties were no 
less a means to an end. Hearst had grand ambitions. He would have loved to be 
President, and his newspapers were evidently acquired to help him achieve that. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as his electoral dreams faded, Hearst used his papers to promulgate 
his strange political agenda that freely blended noisy populism with stony 
reactionism. If Hearst hadn't the need to spread his word, he probably wouldn't 
have built the media empire he did. For him, it was a matter of utter devotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Paley, who founded CBS radio and then CBS television, had neither an artistic 
nor a political temperament. His was social. The son of a Russian immigrant 
cigar manufacturer, Paley grew up with an acute sense of his own social 
inferiority. For him, money was a way to buy status. But by accumulating 
high-priced talent and especially by developing a highly regarded news 
division, he used his radio and TV properties to elevate his status. Media did 
what cigars never could. 
</P>
<P>
 The similarity among Mayer, Hearst and Paley -- and most of the other great 
media pioneers -- was that their investment in the industry was personal: a 
drive, a need, a passion. It was the enactment of this passion through the 
instruments of their media that made them so interesting and their properties 
so much a personal extension of themselves. The way their own needs translated 
the culture's helped make them both so instrumental and so powerful. Here was 
not only profit. Here was desperate love. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to detect any comparable drive in Murdoch. He was born into the 
media, the son of a powerful Australian newspaper executive, and he was born 
into wealth. Though he clearly harbors some class antagonism, particularly 
toward the disdainful English, a young tutor of his at Oxford told Murdoch 
biographer William Shawcross that Murdoch "has no sense of class nuances." 
</P>
<P>
 There isn't any detectable inferiority complex in Murdoch, either -- or any 
obvious demons within. He isn't messianic as Hearst was, and his reactionary 
politics seem driven by self-interest rather than ideological conviction. Even 
the famous sensationalism of his tabloids seems more a merchandising ploy than 
an attempt to rankle the Establishment. If his life was forged by anything, it 
might be the Australian newspaper-circulation wars, with the credo, "Anything 
for money." 
</P>
<P>
 Murdoch is an agglomerator. He has brilliantly parlayed a single newspaper in 
Adelaide, Australia, that his father left him into an empire that includes not 
only the Fox movie studio and TV network but the HarperCollins publishing 
house, magazines, information services, even Barnes & Noble bookstores. He 
apparently wants to be the toll collector on the information superhighway. But 
there is nothing out-sized about him; even the anecdotes concerning him seem 
paltry. He is a visionary without a vision -- an industrialist rather than an 
impresario. 
</P>
<P>
 In their heydays, you could read any Hearst paper, see any MGM movie, watch 
any CBS news broadcast and instantly recognize its provenance because the men 
who owned them were evident in their work. Murdoch is known for his sleaze -- 
especially in his tabloids like the New York Post and the British Sun -- but 
there is little else one can call Murdoch ness in his properties, little that 
is identifiable as his, save the vast, bloodless scale of his ventures. He is 
virtually anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 In fairness to Murdoch, however, he is as much a creature of the new media 
environment as he is a creator of it. When the old media empires were built, 
they emanated glamour and excitement -- not least because the public understood 
that movies, tabloids, radio shows and TV answered deep-seated cultural needs, 
primarily the need for a sense of cultural enfranchisement for the great mass 
of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't get any sense that the public is awaiting the information superhighway 
with baited breath -- it is less a national dream than a dream of technocrats 
and businessmen who stand to profit from it. There is no romantic appeal to the 
information superhighway because it is not about expressing needs or 
democratizing the culture. Like Murdoch himself, it is about money and power.  
</P>
<P>
 During the '80s, the business community and conservative press tried to 
persuade us that money and power were the engine of all things good. But when 
we compare a Murdoch with a Mayer, we cannot help but see that obsession with 
the bottom line, with accumulation as an end rather than a means, has driven 
out the romance and given us sour egomaniacs like Murdoch rather than expansive 
egomaniacs like Mayer, Hearst and Paley. 
</P>
<P>
 What the '80s and '90s have in Murdoch is the new industrial man for the new 
media age. He dreams only of money and power. He dreams not of love.*

THE NATION; ROSTY: ON NOT GOING DOWN FOR THE COUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ben Joravsky, Ben Joravsky, a staff writer for the Chicago Reader, is the 
author of Race and Politics in Chicago (CRS Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Until recently, I've been complacent about the controversy embroiling Rep. Dan 
Rostenkowski (D-Ill.). It wasn't compelling, it lacked the drama, the flair -- 
the sweaty snitch es secretly taping illegal back-room transactions -- of other 
political corruption cases I'd seen. Even the early allegations about bilking 
the congressional post office seemed tepid and dull. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on Tuesday, the feds finally revealed their case, and my attitude 
changed. Let me tell you, I've seen a lot of corruption, and this one is no 
piker. They've charged Rostenkowski with 17 felony counts, alleging 
embezzlement, fraud, conspiracy and obstruction of justice. In addition to the 
post-office machinations, they say he took kickbacks from ghost employees. That 
he used government money to pay a photographer to shoot family functions. That 
he took personal ownership of cars, bought with taxpayer funds, from a 
dealership managed by his campaign chairman's brother. That he improperly 
billed taxpayers for chairs, luggage and china he then distributed as gifts to 
lobbyists and friends. It goes on and on. 
</P>
<P>
 While no fan of Rostenkowski, I now find myself surprisingly moved by his 
mighty fall and strangely overtaken by territorial impulses. He was, after all, 
my man in Congress. His house is not far from mine. I once bumped into him on 
the street and he clapped me on the back and called me "pal." From time to 
time, I'd see him with his cronies, dining at the kind of steak joints where 
they pile huge hunks of meat on your plate. Rostenkowski, as I recall, favored 
ketchup on his steak. 
</P>
<P>
 I figure, who the heck are these prosecutors in Washington -- these snooty Ivy 
League yuppies -- to tell me who my congressman can be? I feel like one of 
those Yellow Dog party loyalists, who keeps returning the same old bums, 
rascals and felons to office. 
</P>
<P>
 The local papers have been going wild with some of the stranger details of 
this sordid saga. There was a story about lavish theme parties -- including a 
Western night, featuring a real chuck wagon -- that Rostenkowski threw at 
taxpayers' expense. They ran a photo of one of the alleged ghost employees -- a 
haggard-looking, elderly lady named Sophie, her body bent with age, who used to 
baby-sit for Rostenkowski's daughters. She probably doesn't know what's hit 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski denies all charges -- which doesn't surprise me. Most politicians 
say they never did it, until after their conviction, when, pleading for 
leniency, they promise never to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
 Either that or they attack their accusers. Huey P. Long, the legendary 
governor and later U.S. senator from Louisiana, mastered this trick. He headed 
off one impeachment movement by accusing his accusers of being henchmen for Big 
Oil, inciting such passions that debate turned to fisticuffs and one 
legislator, standing on a desk to escape the fray, got hit by the blade of a 
ceiling fan. 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, I prefer the approach of James Michael Curley, the former mayor of 
Boston and governor of Massachusetts. During his 50 years in politics, he 
served two sentences in jail. In each case, his attitude was, "Yeah, I did it. 
So what." He apologized for nothing and even titled his autobiography, "I'd Do 
It Again." Curley defined himself as a "friend to the little man." I guess he 
figured most little men would forgive anything -- even corruption -- as long as 
they got theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Other politicians choose to work through their indictments -- the way great 
athletes play through pain. So it was with Rep. Daniel J. Flood. Few people 
today remember Flood, and that's a shame. In his time, he was almost as 
powerful as Rostenkowski. 
</P>
<P>
 Flood was known as "Dapper Dan" -- a sartorial dandy with a waxed mustache, 
who represented a blue-collar district in rural Pennsylvania. During the 1960s 
and '70s, Flood chaired the House appropriations subcommittee, which controlled 
billions of dollars in anti-poverty funds. That meant roads, schools, 
hospitals, bridges and airports for the folks back home. Widows and orphans, 
his obituary said, hailed Flood as their hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Flood spent roughly the last 10 years of his career fending off various 
charges of corruption, which no one in his home district seemed evenly remotely 
concerned with. The feds finally indicted him on bribery charges, but one of 12 
jurors dissented and the case ended in a mistrial. Prosecutors made noises 
about jury tampering, but they couldn't prove a thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Flood must have had a good lawyer to beat that rap. The same can't be said 
about Rostenkowski, who's apparently fired his famous, high-profile lawyer, 
Robert S. Bennett. It seems indicted politicians and their lawyers rarely get 
along -- one is usually accusing the other of screwing up the case. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years back, we had a Democratic political operative here by the name of 
Howard Medley. He was a self-made millionaire who came to Chicago from some 
small town in Arkansas and became a consummate back-room wheeler-dealer. One 
day, he showed me his little black book containing the home and work phone 
numbers of every major politician in town. "I'm Medley," he told me. "And 
Medley's the man." 
</P>
<P>
 Poor Medley; he got caught up in some sleazy bribery scheme. His lawyer's 
strategy was to cast Medley as the unschooled country hick taken in by city 
slickers. Medly wanted none of that. He didn't want to admit that there was a 
man alive smart enough to fool Medley. He replaced the first lawyer with a more 
pliable chap, wound up losing his case and serving time. 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, Medley probably curses both those lawyers. In that regard, he's 
probably a lot like John Gotti, head of New York's notorious Gambino crime 
family, who, it seems, never has a good word to say about any of his lawyers. 
He's called them "rats" and "imbeciles" and even threatened to throw one out a 
window. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, they remained loyal. One of them, Michael Coiro, even went to 
jail for helping conceal the profits from a heroin deal hatched by a Gambino 
mobster. After his conviction, while awaiting sentencing, Coiro met with Gotti 
at the infamous Ravenite Social Club, the gang's favorite gathering place, 
where hidden FBI bugs taped their conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the judge's) gonna give you 10 years," Gotti said. "Maybe look for 
you to do three or four." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll do it, John." Coiro replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that's loyalty. Can you imagine Bennett serving time for Rostenkowski? Fat 
chance. According to the papers, he wanted Rostenkowski to plead guilty to 
lesser corruption charges, give up his seat and spend a few months in jail. You 
call that a deal? If I were a lawyer, I'd be ashamed to bill my client. 
</P>
<P>
 I say Rostenkowski should hire one of those down-and-dirty lawyers who loves a 
court-room fight. That lawyer should paint the prosecutors as a bunch of snooty 
Ivy Leaguers who despise Rostenkowski because he's coarse and crude and pours 
ketchup on his steak. And he should call Sophie to the stand, so she can 
testify about all the wonderful things Rostenkowski has done for her and all 
the little people of Chicago's near northwest side. There wouldn't be a dry eye 
in the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 After the acquittal, I'm sure the lawyer would get invited to join 
Rostenkowski and his cronies for a celebratory meal. They'd probably buy him a 
huge hunk of meat -- with a little ketchup on the side.*

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; PATRICK REYNOLDS; A FAMOUS TOBACCO NAME NOW FIGHTS 
THE SMOKING LOBBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Proffitt, Steve Proffitt is a producer for Fox News and contributor to 
National Public Radio's Morning Edition and All Things Considered. He 
interviewed Patrick Reynolds at his home in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ashtray may soon be a collector's item. The nation's 50 million smokers 
are feeling like an oppressed minority. Tobacco-control advocates have snuffed 
out cigarettes in airplanes, theaters, ball parks and shopping malls. Many 
cities prohibit smoking in restaurants and other public places. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress is now considering a hefty tax increase on cigarettes, a nationwide 
workplace smoking ban and legislation to put the sale and manufacture of 
tobacco products under the regulation of the Food and Drug Administration. The 
states of Florida and Mississippi are suing tobacco companies to recover costs 
of treating diseases caused by smoking. Even the military, home of "Smoke 'em 
if you've got 'em," has prohibited puffing in all but a few designated areas. 
To paraphrase a famous cigarette ad: We've come a long way, baby. 
</P>
<P>
 These accomplishments to curb tobacco use are even more remarkable considering 
the strength of the tobacco industry. The tobacco lobby is one of the most 
powerful and well-funded -- in 1991, tobacco interests spent $2.7 million on 
lobbying and campaign contributions in California alone. That lobby reflects 
the earning power of the business -- in 1992, a tobacco and food conglomerate, 
Philip Morris, was the most profitable in America, with nearly two-thirds of 
its almost $5 billion in profit coming from tobacco sales. 
</P>
<P>
 One of tobacco's most vocal foes wears one of its most familiar names. In 
1911, R.J. Reynolds created Camel cigarettes -- the fastest-selling brand in 
the country today. And R.J.'s grandson, Patrick Reynolds, 45, works full time 
as a lecturer and crusader against the cigarette industry -- financing his 
ventures, in part, with an inheritance rooted in the tobacco fields of North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 When Reynolds was a teen-ager, his father died of emphysema. Even that didn't 
stop the young Reynolds from taking up the tobacco habit. He finally kicked it 
in the mid-'80s, after selling all his tobacco stock. In 1986, he shocked his 
family by testifying on Capitol Hill in favor of a ban on cigarette 
advertising, and quickly became a spokesperson for the growing tobacco-control 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Before finding his calling as an anti-smoking crusader, Reynolds was an 
aspiring actor. He uses his thespian skills and his famous name to hold the 
media's attention and keep tobacco executives' feet to the fire. He works out 
of a modest home in Beverly Hills, where he talked about the tobacco industry's 
impressive political power and his vision of a smoke-free America. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: There has been all this activity -- congressional hearings, FDA 
proposals to regulate smoking, workplace smoking bans. Have we reached some 
sort of critical mass in the anti-smoking movement?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I really hope so. I've been calling for FDA regulation of cigarettes 
for a long time, and now we have an FDA administrator, David Kessler, who's 
saying the same thing. He says he's prepared to show that cigarette 
manufacturers manipulate the levels of nicotine in their products, and he's 
waiting for a mandate from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest thing that will come out of FDA regulation is that manufacturers 
will have to print the ingredients on the packs -- so that people will know 
what chemicals they are ingesting when they smoke. Meanwhile, (Rep.) Henry 
Waxman (D-Los Angeles) has a bill to ban smoking in the workplace. That would 
be a national ban, and, of course, the tobacco industry is fighting it tooth 
and nail, with all their power and might. 
</P>
<P>
 But the core issue, as I see it, is the power of the tobacco lobby . . . . 
Look what they have achieved. America has the lowest cigarette tax of any 
industrialized country in the world. It averages about 50 cents a pack; in 
Canada, it's $3.26 a pack. We've failed to ban cigarette advertising -- 
cigarettes are the most heavily advertised product in America. The tobacco 
industry is spending somewhere around $4 billion a year to associate smoking 
with images of health and beauty and romance. Cigarette advertising is the 
greatest lie in history. They're spending $15 per person, for every man, woman 
and child in this country, to promote smoking. And they spend freely to make 
sure an advertising ban will never make it out of committee in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 They are very much around at the local level, too. The tobacco lobby sends 
slick lawyers into state capitals to get watered-down anti-smoking legislation 
passed that preempts many of the local anti-smoking ordinances we have worked 
so hard to put into law. 
</P>
<P>
 Exporting of cigarettes to Asia -- again the special interests are responsible 
for that, for hundreds of millions of people becoming addicted in those 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the 1980s, Sen. Jesse Helms went to see President Reagan, and said, 
"We've got a balance-of-payments problem here, Ron; how come we can't sell 
American cigarettes in some of these foreign markets?" So Reagan got the 
government to start pressing the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan and said, 
"If you don't lower your tariffs on our cigarettes, we're going to slap trade 
penalties on you." 
</P>
<P>
 Those governments caved in, lowered their import taxes on cigarettes, and then 
the American tobacco industry began a full-scale ad campaign in those 
countries. Partly as a result, smoking has increased 70% around the world since 
1968. So while people think we are somehow winning the battle against smoking, 
we're actually losing when you look at it worldwide . . . . But the real 
critical mass -- the paradigm shift -- may be political. For years, politicians 
have been able to accept huge amounts of money from the tobacco lobby, and vote 
to support the lobby's interests, while escaping the wrath of the public. But 
with so much attention on the issue of smoking, they can't still look good and 
vote with the tobacco lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What sort of regulation would you like to see on the sale and marketing of 
cigarettes?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Appropriate regulation -- regulation that at least duplicates what's going 
on in other countries. We should have the warning label on the front of the 
pack, as Canada requires. Ban advertising and raise taxes, as Canada has done. 
The difference between the Canadian government and ours? It's the power of the 
special interests and the money that goes into the hands of the politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Another important regulation would raise the age for purchasing cigarettes to 
21. It would require merchants to have a license to sell cigarettes, just like 
liquor. There are statistics which really make the case for this -- of all 
smokers, 60% start by the age of 14 years old, and 90% by the age of 19. That 
means only one smoker in 10 starts after the age of 19. If we can keep 
cigarettes away from kids until they reach 21, we could go a long way toward 
eliminating the problem. So the purchase of cigarettes must be regulated as 
seriously as alcohol. This means banning vending machines as well. You can't 
buy a beer in a vending machine. But vending machines are how children are 
getting cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What sort of a tax would you like to see applied to cigarettes?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The direct medical costs related to smoking is $22 billion a year. If you 
divide that by the number of packs of cigarettes sold every year, the figure 
comes out to $2.17 of direct medical costs per pack. So, at the very least, the 
tax should pay for the cost of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 But let me make a somewhat radical proposal. I believe that the future of 
tobacco control may lie in nationalizing the tobacco companies. This means that 
the government would pay an appropriate, or perhaps an inappropriate price for 
the tobacco companies and from that point forward, all the profits would go to 
Uncle Sam. Imagine how much easier the job of tobacco control would be if there 
was no more money spent on lobbyists. I am not a socialist. As a rule, I don't 
believe in nationalizing industries, but tobacco is an exception: It's the only 
product sold which, when used as intended, causes death. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Where do the 54 million people who smoke fit into this debate? Don't we 
need to focus on them at some point?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, but I will tell you candidly that we have limited dollars -- and it 
costs a lot more to get someone to stop smoking than it does to educate 
children not to ever start smoking. It's vastly more costly to get addicts off 
cigarettes. I don't think we can ignore or neglect the issue of smoking 
cessation, however. And I think the tobacco industry's assertion that smokers 
have choice sounds good, but how much of a choice do smokers really have when 
cigarettes are as addicting as heroin? 
</P>
<P>
 I do believe that if under Clinton's health-care program, employers are going 
to pay for the health care of their employees, then smoking cessation programs 
should be included in the national health-care program. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you believe people have a right to smoke and, if so, what rights do they 
have?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Smoker's have a right to smoke, but the right of nonsmokers to breathe 
clean air supersedes the right of smokers. So it is very appropriate to ban 
smoking in the workplace, in public places like restaurants and airports, in 
enclosed spaces where people have to breathe. But I don't believe in a 
cigarette prohibition. The tobacco industry would love to have tobacco-control 
advocates such as myself take the position that cigarettes should be banned, 
because then they could call us zealots or fanatics , and dismiss us. I take a 
moderate and what I feel is an appropriate position. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about Hollywood? While cigarettes have disappeared almost entirely 
from television, there's still a lot of smoking in the movies. Are you trying 
to do anything about that?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, and I think we need to do something to encourage stars like Wynona 
Rider from chain-smoking throughout a movie like "Reality Bites." We should 
encourage her to argue with her producers and say, "Hey, I don't want my 
character to smoke; I may be a role model for young women, and the last thing I 
want them to do is smoke cigarettes." If Wynona Rider had the courage to do 
that, it could make a difference. Perhaps she's taken an unfair beating for 
smoking in that movie, but that may be the kind of pressure we have to put on 
stars to make them refuse to smoke in movies. 
</P>
<P>
 And here's something that's never been printed, as far as I know. I have it on 
very good authority that the firm U.S. Tobacco financed a movie called "Pure 
Country." In that movie, all the cowboy heroes chewed tobacco, and it was 
financed by the company most responsible for producing chewing tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Some years ago, you talked about achieving a smoke-free America by the year 
2000. It seemed like an outrageous idea just a few years ago, and now it's 
seeming to be something that might almost be achievable. When do you think you 
can put yourself out of business?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't think I will be out of business in my lifetime. With hundreds of 
millions of addicts around the world, there will always be plenty of work for 
tobacco-control advocates. I always point out that, a few years ago, we thought 
we'd never get smoking off airplanes, and today we and wonder if it was really 
true that there ever was smoking on airplanes. So one day we are going to look

THE WORLD; PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE; THE LATEST POLITICAL WEAPON IN HAITI: MILITARY 
RAPES OF WOMEN AND GIRLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA HAMILTON PHELAN, Anna Hamilton Phelan, who wrote the screenplays for 
Mask and Gorillas in the Mist, is a member of Artists for Democracy in Haiti. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Haiti, naked boys are a common sight, because the heat is so oppressive. 
But even in the sweltering slum of Cite Soleil, the genitals of girls are 
covered. The practice, it is said, honors the "birth part" of females as the 
"pathway of life." Such respect kept rape in Haiti to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's all changed. Since September, 1991, when the democratically elected 
president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, was ousted in a military coup, the incidence 
of rape, of women and girls, has jumped alarmingly. These rapes have a specific 
purpose: political repression. 
</P>
<P>
 I've just returned from Haiti. With the assistance of an anthropologist who 
has worked in Haiti for 10 years on women's reproductive health, I was able to 
enter certain neighborhoods and secretly videotape the testimonies of women who 
had been raped. They were all assaulted by either members of the military, the 
police or the newly formed anti-democratic party known as FRAPH (in Haitian 
Creole, "to hit"). Guns, clubs and machetes were used to intimidate them. Many 
were repeatedly told they were being raped because they or their male partners 
participated in pro-democracy activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The women who spoke to us took an enormous risk. They knew we could not help 
them leave Haiti. They understood they would not be paid for their statements. 
These women, whose emotions ranged from terror to anger to a kind of catatonic 
detachment, just wanted the truth to get out. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the constant presence of FRAPH members in the neighborhoods, I 
disguised myself as a health-care worker. I hid my camcorder in a bag. While 
the interviews were being conducted in the darkest corners at the back of 
shacks, other women guarded the doors. When FRAPH members appeared, the women 
would sing, signaling us to turn the camera light out and be quiet. As soon as 
it was safe, we continued. 
</P>
<P>
 The following are three accounts: 
</P>
<P>
 * Jacqueline's husband was a pro-democracy activist who refused to remove 
Aristide's poster from his wall after the coup. The military was soon onto him. 
He went into hiding. Jacqueline was living with her aunt when seven members of 
the military broke into their tin-and-cardboard shack. They accused her of 
concealing her husband's whereabouts, of voting for Aristide and of being a 
member of the resistance.  
</P>
<P>
 She was raped successively by the seven men. The incident produced a son, who 
appeared quite ill. The soldiers said they would return. Today, she is on the 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rene was a vendor for a pro-democracy newspaper. When members of the 
military came to his house, they beat him and raped his wife, Carmen. When 
their baby boy started to cry, one of the soldiers hit him with the butt of his 
rifle. The family has since moved to another neighborhood, where Rene is again 
circulating the newspaper and Carmen is organizing pro-Aristide women. 
</P>
<P>
 * Celene was active in a women's merchant cooperative, considered by the 
military to be a political organization simply because the women want to 
improve their lot. She also belongs to a grass-roots group seeking the return 
of democracy. Last February, armed FRAPH members broke into their complex. She 
was tied up and forced to watch them rape her 12-year-old child. Then they 
burned the co-op's house. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight in Port-au-Prince, the impostors in power will sit down to an 
eight-course dinner and laugh at that supposedly new, tighter sanctions. They 
will continue to make millions as drug and embargo barons. U.S. politicians 
will continue to set their moral compasses according to poll results on 
immigration. And in Cite Soleil, a hungry and terrified Jacqueline will be 
moving in the shadows, her sick son in her arms, stopping at each shack hoping 
someone will hide her for another night.*

VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * George Ramos, in his May 23 column regarding educational goals and the 
motivation we establish for our schoolchildren, misses one critical point: Auto 
mechanics (today's technicians) are not grease monkeys. To succeed, they need a 
solid foundation in physics, chemistry, math, electronics and communication 
skills. In other words, they need similar courses (in high school) to those 
required for a career in the sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no ethnic or economic background questions asked of prospective auto 
technician employees. The only question is: Can you diagnose and repair it 
efficiently? Schools should follow the same policy and encourage children to 
maximize their potential in the vocations as well as in the arts and sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 To make vocational training an ethnic issue in schools, or something to be 
avoided and looked down on, is a terrible disservice to the majority of 
students who must eventually earn their living in the vocations. The highly 
paid, stable vocational jobs are out there for those who prepare. 
</P>
<P>
 I happened to read the column while writing an article on 
aerospace-to-automotive repair skills-transfer for our trade association paper. 
How ironic that you mention that two Hughes engineers were among career day 
participants at Humphreys Avenue School. Ironic because my article described a 
pilot defense conversion program now training, as auto technicians, former 
Hughes aerospace technicians, engineers and one physicist. They are interested, 
challenged and enthusiastic students.  
</P>
<P>
 California is now drastically short of well-educated, skilled workers in all 
the vocations. Yet they are key to attracting a variety of businesses which 
will supply the well-paid jobs needed in this state. If the media and the 
educational Establishment fail to motivate and educate qualified students 
toward the vocations, we will continue our slide toward Third World status.

 * I was both comforted and enraged when I read the column by Ramos. You see, I 
too was a victim of blind prejudice by a counselor. At the age of 11, I was 
transplanted from a very humble neighborhood in Mexico to Los Angeles. I was 
always the well-behaved kid sitting in the back of the room. I persevered and 
managed to survive the "you are bright, if only you weren't Mexican" syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 I entered UCLA in 1968 to undertake pre-med studies. My "well-meaning" 
counselor called me in and told me to study a trade -- like a car mechanic. He 
told me that statistics showed that I would eventually fail and leave UCLA. As 
I was leaving his office feeling empty and confused, he told me that "water 
will always seek its own level." Since that day, as I awaken from my sleep and 
rise, the very first thought that enters my mind is that my water level will 
always be where I set it. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-six years have passed. I am board-certified by both the American Board 
of Surgery and the American Board of Cardiothoracic Surgery. I am a 
cardiovascular surgeon with a very prestigious medical group in Los Angeles. I 
have taught heart surgery at the University of California. I am trained to 
perform adult and pediatric open-heart surgery, thoracic surgery, cancer 
surgery of the lung, cardiothoracic trauma, arrhythmia surgery, etc. I have 
been chief of surgery at various institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 School counselors are not always right. I am only sorry that school counselors 
-- elementary school to universities -- cannot discern the difference between 
stupidity, prejudice and well-meaning intentions.

HELICOPTER USE

 * Re "Clinton Aide Resigns Over Golf Outing," May 27: The unauthorized use of 
government helicopters for a golf outing is inexcusable. The initial attempt to 
cover up this deed with lies ("on the way back from Camp David" and "were 
scouting the course for the President to play") is just another example of the 
lack of honesty and integrity in the senior officials of the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this is detestable but what really got to me was the photo showing a 
Marine in full dress uniform saluting these men as they boarded the helicopter. 
The President, despite his miserable reputation as a military man, is entitled 
to a salute because he is commander in chief. Why is a senior aide to the 
President accepting military honors while on his golf outing? 
</P>

 When are we going to once again be able to respect our Administration?

earlier this year in North Carolina: "And, even if the presidential party does 
not stay overnight, there is the cost of running the presidential party down to 
Charlotte on an aircraft that, according to a congressional panel, costs 
$40,243 an hour to operate" (March 29). Why bother with small change?

THE STATE; YOUR LEAST-INFORMED VOTE COULD END UP KILLING YOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles L. Lindner, Charles L. Lindner is former president of the Los 
Angeles County Criminal Bar Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Welcome to your biannual encounter with a black hole -- voting for judges. 
When you arrive at the midpoint of your ballot Tuesday, you might recall Butch 
Cassidy's recurring question to the Sundance Kid: "Who are those guys?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, those guys -- all 240 Superior Court judges -- can kill you. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges daily play a far more important role than the governor or Legislature 
in the lives of ordinary citizens. The governor may order new prisons built, 
but a judge decides whether an 18-year-old gets to sing alto in the prison 
choir. And it is a judge who decides which spouse gets the house, or whether 
you keep your driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 Enforced voter ignorance is California's compromise solution to "judicial 
reform." Under the guise of "professionalism" and "merit appointments," the 
power elites seem to have a vested interest in frustrating any meaningful 
public participation in judicial selection. Practically speaking, as long as 
judges avoid the death penalty, raising taxes or desegregating schools, they 
can go about their careers guarded by the impenetrable shield of public 
ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting judges would probably do away with elections completely but for the 
bugaboo of California's 90-year constitu- tional experiment with populism. 
Starting in the 1920s, such reformers as Chief Justice Phil S. Gibson sought to 
increase the professionalism, autonomy and competence of the courts. But to do 
so required giving in to anti-democratic pressures that placed judges above the 
voters. Conversely, it was clear that judges should be insulated from the 
tyranny of a mob mentality, no matter how democratic the mob's origins may be. 
</P>
<P>
 So California adopted the Modified Minnesota Plan: The judiciary would be 
professionalized and jurists would be subject to periodic voter review. The 
governor first fills a judgeship by appointment, and the newly appointed judge 
stands before the voters two years later (Superior Court) or as many as six 
years later (Municipal Court). 
</P>
<P>
 This quasi-populist plan has not worked terribly well. Running for a judgeship 
in Los Angeles is outrageously expensive. The registrar charges a Superior 
Court candidate $92,550 to publish a 200-word ballot statement. If a challenger 
is wealthy enough to overcome this hurdle, there is an ambush waiting when he 
or she submits a statement to the registrar. As if to guarantee public 
ignorance about the contestants, the Elections Code forbids a judicial 
candidate from writing anything about his opponent in the pamphlet, even if a 
charge is true. 
</P>
<P>
 Take a Burbank Municipal Court race. Incumbent Marion E. Gubler obtained an 
injunction to prevent his opponent, attorney Rand S. Rubin, from noting that 
Gubler was publicly censured for judicial misconduct by the California Supreme 
Court -- even though the charge is true and is published in the Supreme Court's 
case reports. In Gubler vs. Commission on Judicial Performance (1984), the 
court stated: "His (Gubler's) culpability transcends mere legal error. All of 
the misconduct established in the foregoing opinion constituted as least 
conduct prejudicial (to the administration of justice); some was committed with 
gross negligence; and some amounted to willful misconduct. The commission's 
recommendation of public censure is clearly correct." 
</P>
<P>
 The court's case disposition reads: "Accordingly, and by this order, Judge 
Gubler is publicly censured." 
</P>
<P>
 Why is it illegal for Rubin to quote the state Supreme Court in his ballot 
statement? Because when applied to judicial elections, the breadth of the First 
Amendment's "free speech" provisions are limited. And who does the limiting? 
Judges do the limiting. So even when they screw up, it is virtually impossible 
for citizens to learn about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither major political party favors judicial elections because judgeships are 
a patronage goodie. Chicagoans call it "clout." California lawyers call it 
"juice." Whichever. A lawyer becomes a judge by pushing enough "juice"/"clout" 
through the political pipeline to attract the governor's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a recurring joke at the start of UC Berkeley's one-week "Judges' 
College" that some newly appointed judge will introduce his- or herself by 
saying, "I was a merit appointment." Such a jurist soon carries an invisible 
name tag that only his colleagues can read: "Harmless Idiot -- Do Not Take 
Seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether by dint of "juice" or merit, a judge appointed to sit in Los Angeles 
County probably has a job for life, because who is going to tell you if he or 
she messed up? 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate problem, of course, is that few attorneys are willing to comment 
publicly on a judge's qualifications. After all, the judge might still be there 
the day after the election. 
</P>
<P>
 The only source of information in such a situation is the Los Angeles County 
Bar Assn., which includes a Judicial Evaluations Committee that screens the 
candidates. Committee membership is quite diverse, embracing the full spectrum 
of legal and political beliefs, from extreme right to left, from large law 
firms to solo practitioners. Prosecutors and defense attorneys are active as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Before an election, the committee's 50 members spend months checking the 
backgrounds and skills of the candidates. Ideology is not considered. What 
counts is experience, demeanor, ability and scholarship. Candidates are ranked 
either "well-qualified," "qualified" or "unqualified." On the whole, the 
committee's assessments are accurate, but like any judgment, should be 
considered along with other available information. 
</P>
<P>
 These evaluations certainly provide a rational alternative to voting for 
judges on the basis of gender, ethnic-sounding names or strange titles. But 
they require a voter to be enormously self-motivated. Clearly, most voters 
don't have the time for such an undertaking, and end up relying on others to 
make up their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, we have a system of judicial review that is neither populist nor 
independent of political influence.*

PRIMARY ELECTION ENDORSEMENTS

 * The Times is 180 degrees off base in its criticism of Los Angeles County 
Assessor Kenneth P. Hahn and its refusal to endorse him for reelection (May 
25). As assessor, Hahn has done a very fine job. Four years ago there were over 
2.7 million errors on the assessment roll and calls poured into the offices of 
the Board of Supervisors and other elected officials from constituents 
complaining about the assessor's office. Now that flood of complaints has been 
reduced to a trickle. 
</P>
<P>
 All five supervisors -- both Democratic and Republican -- have endorsed 
Kenneth Hahn. Most state legislators from Los Angeles County have endorsed 
Hahn, as have all 15 members of the Los Angeles City Council. The presidents of 
both the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. and the Los Angeles Taxpayers Assn. have 
endorsed Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
 The silly and ill-advised practical jokes Hahn played on his former rival were 
entirely separate from Hahn's official duties and in no way impacted the 
functions of his office.  
</P>
<P>
 We plan to vote for Kenneth Hahn.

 * I have worked in the legal profession for over 20 years and during that time 
have witnessed the overall deterioration in the caliber of judges sitting in 
the Los Angeles County courts and have heard more disparaging remarks about 
judges than I care to admit. I read with interest your May 29 endorsement of 
judicial candidate Ronald Coen, the incumbent, rated "qualified," as opposed to 
Charles Fleishman, the challenger, who was rated "well qualified" by the Los 
Angeles County Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would you endorse a judicial candidate rated less qualified over a 
candidate rated more qualified by the very legal professionals who yearn to try 
cases before the best judges possible? I would not want to have a lawsuit of 
mine tried before a judge known to be "rigid, even impatient"!

 * In your endorsements of Superior Court candidates (May 29), you needlessly 
impugned the integrity of Susan Bryant-Deason, a candidate for Office No. 93. 
</P>
<P>
 After correctly observing that Ms. Bryant-Deason is one of only two candidates 
for this office given the L.A. County Bar's highest rating, you suggested that, 
as a prosecutor, she exercised "poor judgment" that in some unexplained manner 
led to an allegation that the U.S. attorney's office improperly targeted 
individuals selling drugs near schoolyards. Nothing could be further from the 
truth. Although criminal defense attorneys made allegations of improper 
targeting by law enforcement agencies and the office itself, there has never 
been a judicial finding that this occurred. Moreover, as the U.S. attorney who 
oversaw the office's schoolyard law prosecutions, I can state categorically 
that the allegation of improper targeting is untrue. Far from using poor 
judgment, Ms. Bryant-Deason did an extraordinary job as a prosecutor enforcing 
the federal schoolyard law, a law requiring heavier penalties for dealers 
selling drugs within 1,000 feet of a school. Indeed, her efforts led to 
enactment by the California Legislature of a similar tough state law.  
</P>
<P>
 As a federal prosecutor, Ms. Bryant-Deason also put away some of the biggest 
drug traffickers around. She is a tough, but fair prosecutor who has 
consistently used good judgment and who will make an outstanding Superior Court 
judge. You gave the slight edge to her opponent, evidently based on allegations 
that are not true. Therefore, it seems to me that you should have endorsed Ms. 
Bryant-Deason, clearly the best candidate for this position.

 * Regarding your voter's guide and endorsement editorial (May 29) on the race 
for the County Board of Supervisors, Third District: To set the record 
straight, I announced my candidacy on Dec. 1, the same day Ed Edelman announced 
his retirement. Zev Yaroslavsky, your endorsed candidate, didn't announce until 
weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 I know from personal experience that the residents are starved for information 
about the candidates in this race, and for new ideas at the County Board of 
Supervisors. During 30 community forums, and nearly 200 additional meetings, 
the people expressed disgust and dismay at the lack of news coverage of the 
campaign. The Times covered only one forum (April 29), and that was because 
Yaroslavsky finally deigned to appear in the same room with the other 
candidates. Of course, he had set strict conditions on his appearance -- no 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
 What is particularly galling is the fact that The Times editorializes that 
Yaroslavsky's theme of "openness in government" is what swayed you to endorse 
him. If Yaroslavsky is so committed to openness, why has he avoided community 
forums? Why has he refused to debate any challenger?

TIMES ENDORSEMENTS IN TUESDAY'S ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 T he Times policy is to endorse selectively, on a case-by-case basis. Only 
those races in which this newspaper is endorsing in Tuesday's election are 
listed below. We are taking a position in only one statewide race, for 
superintendent of public instruction, because it is the only nonpartisan 
statewide contest. The Times normally does not endorse in partisan primaries in 
statewide races. State Offices 
</P>
<P>
 State Superintendent of Public Instruction -- DELAINE EASTIN. The Fremont 
assemblywoman offers the experience and legislative savvy needed for this 
important post. Propositions 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 175 (Renter's Income Tax Credit): NO. This measure would embed the 
renter's tax credit in the state Constitution and require a two-thirds vote to 
change it. Not prudent. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 176 (Tax Break/Nonprofit Organizations: NO. Would amend 
Constitution to exempt qualifying nonprofit organizations from locally imposed 
business license taxes or fees based on income or gross receipts. Amend the 
Constitution for this? 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 177 (Tax Break/Disabled Person's Access): YES. Federal law 
requires owners of commercial properties that are open to the public to make 
improvements for disabled persons. But by complying with that law, owners can 
be penalized with higher taxes for their improved properties. Proposition 177 
would amend the Constitution to exempt such future structural modifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 178 (Tax Break/Water Conservation): YES. Similar to Proposition 
177, this measure would exempt new water conservation equipment installed on 
agricultural land from property tax reassessment until that land is sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 179 (Murder Punishment): YES. This measure increases the minimum 
sentence for second-degree murder resulting from a drive-by shooting from 15 to 
20 years. (The proposition amends an earlier constitutional amendment; of 
course all of this should have been done by the Legislature and not by 
constitutional revision). 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 180 (Park Bonds): YES. The 1994 Parks and Wildlife Initiative 
authorizes up to $1.98 billion in general obligation bonds for state parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 1A (Earthquake Bonds): YES. Provides $2 billion to meet 
earthquake-related needs, including repairing or rebuilding schools and other 
public buildings, utilities and streets and roads damaged in the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 1B (K-12 Bonds): YES. Makes available $1 billion for construction, 
reconstruction and modernization projects at elementary and secondary schools 
throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 1C (Higher Education Bonds): YES. Authorizes the state to borrow 
$900 million for capital investment in higher education, including earthquake 
retrofitting. Los Angeles County Offices 
</P>

 Supervisor District 1: GLORIA MOLINA. Molina is running unopposed for a 
reason: She represents her constituents well and has given county government a 
much-needed shake-up.

 Assessor: JOHN CARL BROGDON. The assessor's office, which determines property 
tax bills, has long suffered from serious leadership and morale problems. It is 
too important to be embroiled in pettiness. Brogdon, a retired veteran of the 
office, could bring needed calm and direction. L.A. County Superior Court

services at Bet Tzedek, which aids the elderly and poor. He has the patience, 
fairness and compassion to be an excellent judge.

</P>
<P>
 Altadena -- Proposition A (Special Assessment): YES. Authorizes an annual 
special assessment for five years to provide funds for the Altadena Library 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 Downey -- Proposition C (Charter Amendment): YES. Amends the City Charter to 
make the date of municipal elections the same as state general elections in 
even-numbered years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawthorne -- Proposition B (School Bond): YES. Provides for the issuing of $15 
million in Hawthorne School District bonds to fund safety and other 
improvements to school facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach -- Proposition M (Campaign Reform): YES. Would limit contributions, 
limit overall spending on a voluntary basis, provide limited public funding and 
impose strict rules of contribution disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Proposition D (Adopts Civic Center Specific Plan): YES. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Proposition E (Amends City's General Plan): YES. 
</P>
<P>
 These measures in tandem would act as a referendum on Santa Monica's Civic 
Center Specific Plan. The plan grew out of desires of the city, the county and 
the RAND Corp. to upgrade city-center facilities. RAND would pay $14.9 million 
for public improvements, and the city would spend $12.2 million to build a 
parking garage, with that money coming from tax revenue earmarked for 
transportation. A "yes" vote on Proposition D approves adoption of the plan; 
"yes" on Proposition E amends the city's general plan. For passage, both 
propositions must be approved. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena Proposition L (Library Tax): YES. Institutes a five-year 
library special tax to maintain current services at South Pasadena's library.

NUCLEAR BRINKSMANSHIP REDEFINED; NORTH KOREA: ITS DEFIANCE OF INTERNATIONAL 
AUTHORITY MERITS SANCTIONS, BUT CHINA AND JAPAN HAVE TO BE ON THE TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER D. ZIMMERMAN, Peter D. Zimmerman, a nuclear physicist and 
proliferation expert, is visiting senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 North Korea has forced the world's hand. Hans Blix, the director-general of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency, informed the United Nations on Thursday 
that he could no longer determine whether or not North Korea had diverted 
material from its reactor to nuclear weapons. The day before, Blix had offered 
the Koreans a final line of retreat, but they refused.  
</P>
<P>
 The only reasonable inference is that North Korea has built, and plans to 
keep, nuclear weapons in defiance of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 The director-general has waited patiently, acting carefully. In February, 
1992, the IAEA had good reason to suspect that the Koreans had nuclear 
ambitions. The IAEA found evidence that the Koreans had extracted 
weapons-usable plutonium from their reactor during a 100-day shutdown in 1989. 
The North Koreans "confessed," but said that they had separated only about 3 
1/2 ounces of the explosive metal. Using sensitive analyses, the IAEA knew that 
it was more likely that many pounds had been diverted. The apparent discrepancy 
could have been resolved by measurements of two waste storage sites in the 
Yongbyon nuclear complex, but North Korea refused.  
</P>
<P>
 Blix's only remaining choice was to wait until North Korea discharged spent 
fuel from its reactor, and then to demand examination of 300 carefully selected 
fuel rods. In these the IAEA would find written the radioactive history of the 
1989 shutdown and clues to the Korean arsenal. The North Koreans, however, have 
deliberately extracted these fuel rods without observers present, and have 
probably scrambled the order of the rods so that, as Blix wrote the U.N. 
secretary general, "future measurements would be meaningless . . . and would 
not permit the agency to ascertain whether nuclear material from the reactor 
had been diverted."  
</P>
<P>
 The IAEA has acted correctly. It did not declare safeguards irrevocably lost 
until North Korea acted to destroy the isotopic record. The U.S. government has 
also acted impeccably. To no avail, the Clinton Administration made clear to 
North Korea that we would respond to nuclear honesty by facilitating an end to 
the North's isolation.  
</P>
<P>
 The time for other measures has arrived, starting with President Clinton's 
call for economic sanctions.  
</P>
<P>
 Kim Il-sung, North Korea's dictator, has said that sanctions are an act of 
war, and he threatens a second, and nuclear, Korean conflict, which would 
annihilate North Korea and destroy some of the South. One may reasonably doubt 
that his response will be so swift and violent. He has played his cards too 
shrewdly these last months for us to believe that he is quite as irrational as 
he would like us to assume.  
</P>
<P>
 Sanctions, while short of war, are designed to compel North Korea to do 
something that it otherwise would not. A list of demanded acts must precede a 
resolution imposing sanctions. Inspection of the reactor's fuel is useless; 
examination of the waste dumps will do nothing about existing weapons.  
</P>
<P>
 Sanctions should be aimed at forcing the North to take three steps: The 
nuclear weapons they have must be dismantled and the fissile fuel handed over 
to the IAEA; the full records of the North Korean nuclear programs, peaceful 
and military, including supplier lists and personnel files, must be made 
available to the United Nations and the IAEA; and all plutonium and refined 
uranium in the country must be removed from North Korea, just as it was from 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 China and Japan are the keys. If they support sanctions, sanctions can 
succeed; if they do not, necessary American efforts could lead directly to war. 
The Clinton Administration and the IAEA have set a correct course; it is up to 
the rest of the world to follow.

VOICES: EYEWITNESS TO D-DAY; WHEN U.S. TROOPS HIT BEACHES OF NORMANDY JUNE 6, 
1944, HAPPY COOPER WAS THERE TO HELP THEM ASHORE. AND HE WAS THERE TO HELP FEED 
THEM AND PATCH THEM UP WHEN THEY CAME BACK.

<P>
By HAPPY COOPER, Happy Cooper, 75, of Huntington Park is a Navy veteran who 
served aboard the transport ship Henrico during the Allied invasion of Normandy 
on June 6, 1944. It was the largest amphibious assault in the history of modern 
warfare, involving 5,000 ships, 2,000 aircraft and 160,000 soldiers, and 
covering a rugged 50-mile stretch of coastline. D-day marked the beginning of 
the end of World War II in Europe. Less than a year after the invasion, Nazi 
Germany surrendered. Cooper, a first-class ship cook, was awarded the Purple 
Heart for his service during the invasion of Okinawa and also took part in the 
invasion of the Philippines. The New York native has lived in Huntington Park 
since 1961 and is a member of the South Gate posts of the American Legion and 
Veterans of Foreign Wars. Cooper was interviewed by Kirby Lee.

<P>
 I made good pay as a merchant marine, transporting freight, grain and 
ammunition from New York to Scotland or England. I would have never thought 
about joining the Navy because the pay was nowhere as good. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a German submarine torpedoed our ship in the English Channel, my 
parents became worried about me making trips across the Atlantic without any 
protection. So I joined the Navy to please them. 
</P>
<P>
 I enlisted on Aug. 11, 1941, and helped put the Henrico in commission in New 
Jersey that fall. It was a cargo ship converted into an army transport ship. At 
times, we carried as many as 5,500 soldiers. I stayed with the Henrico as a 
first-class cook throughout the war. 
</P>
<P>
 We were off the coast of Scotland for six weeks before D-day. We would load up 
troops and take them out for training at night. We would put them in small 
landing boats and teach them how to get out of the ship, rendezvous and then 
come back to the ship. 
</P>
<P>
 We stayed there until June 4 and then went to Plymouth, England, and loaded up 
a whole lot more troops and ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 Us Navy guys knew we were going to hit a beachhead in France for a good week 
in advance of D-day. But we didn't know where until we left for Normandy the 
night of June 5. We didn't care where the invasion was going to be or what was 
going to happen. We just wanted to go out and do it. 
</P>
<P>
 We sent the first wave out of the ship at 5:30 in the morning. The landing 
boats, carrying 55 to 65 soldiers each, would rendezvous in a circle with a 
flag boat. After the red flag went up, they would head toward the beach. When 
they got close enough, a green flag would go up and that would mean hit that 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
 They announced over the loudspeakers they wanted volunteers to take the second 
wave in. I was off duty at the time, so I said to the first-class butcher, 
"Let's go." I volunteered to be the coxswain to steer the boat. The butcher was 
a deckhand and we got another kid to be the engineer.  
</P>
<P>
 There was no shelling on the first wave and we heard very little activity. 
Some shooting and firing but nothing serious. So we went out there and started 
toward the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans must have woke up and they threw everything at us. It was like 
salt and pepper raining all around you with bullets flying. You didn't stop to 
look at them, either. You kept your concentration on going in and kept your 
head down. 
</P>
<P>
 We were only about three miles offshore, but it took about an hour and a half 
to reach the beach because the waters were so choppy. You just didn't drive in 
there slowly. You poured the fuel to that engine and gave her full throttle to 
make that boat go as fast as that thing would fly through the water. 
</P>
<P>
 When you went in, you didn't go in a straight line. You kept weaving, so if 
the Germans tried to aim on you, they missed. But coming back, you went out 
straight as fast as you could back to your ship. 
</P>
<P>
 When we got back, that's when all hell broke loose. I didn't volunteer a 
second time to take boats in. That was enough for me. By the time you got back 
to the ship, you were really shook up. 
</P>
<P>
 As the day went on, the fight got heavier on both sides. Shells were always 
flying and they were getting pretty darn close to us, too. It must have been 
hell on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 I just lucked out we didn't get hit. Everybody was shaky and you didn't know 
when a shot would hit you or sink your boat. We cooked six hours on and six 
hours off and only got three to four hours of sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 We brought back a lot of injured troops and put them in sick bay. They would 
keep them there and transport them to England. But a lot of them only got 
nicked or shot. They could patch them up and send them back out. 
</P>
<P>
 We were off Normandy for four days. By then, the battle was over. We went back 
to the United States and stayed here for 15 days and went out to the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 The Normandy beachhead was the biggest battle Americans figured that the 
United States had. But to us, it wasn't. Guam was. 
</P>
<P>
 Those Japanese suicide bombers had no mercy on us. Our ship got hit by a 
suicide plane carrying a 500-pound bomb. The butcher and I were the only two 
men on that side of the ship to come out alive. 
</P>
<P>
 I was bounced around like a rubber ball, but I got up and started rescuing 
people from the water. We couldn't get them all and lost a lot of them to 
sharks. I was given the Purple Heart. When I received the award, the Navy 
captain asked me why I didn't smile. I said, "Sir. You don't know how close I 
came to getting the Black Heart." 
</P>
<P>
 When we finally got to San Francisco . . . doctors discovered I had 25 ulcers 
from the size of a pin to a nickel. My weight dropped from 180 to 125 pounds. A 
lot of times the cramps and pain would hit so hard, I wish I could have died. 
</P>
<P>
 I was rated as 80% disability and discharged. I wanted to stay in the service 
for 20 years and tried to re-enlist, but they wouldn't let me. They told me, 
"You're half dead, it's time for you to go home."  
</P>
<P>
 I was in the Navy for three years, two months and 18 days and don't regret any 
moment of it. 
</P>
<P>
 If it weren't for the invasion on the Normandy beachhead, we'd be under a 
dictatorship, walking under Japanese or German flags now. It was something that 
had to be done to save your loved ones and your country.

VOICES: MARATHON MAN; MELGES SCOTT RAN WITH A DANGEROUS CROWD AS A YOUTH. NOW 
HE GOES THE EXTRA MILES -- 26 OF THEM -- TO HELP OTHERS.

By MELGES SCOTT, Melges Scott, 22, is developmentally disabled and has 
completed a special-education program at Dorsey High School. He will continue 
special-education classes at Santa Monica City College and compete for the 
Santa Monica Track Club. Scott has been competing five or six years, mostly in 
marathons, and is in training as a Los Angeles outreach representative for 
Special Olympics. He is also with Student Run L.A., a school district-sponsored 
volunteer program that gets students involved in running and marathon training. 
Scott, of South-Central, averages 40 events a year, including Special Olympics 
and Student Run L.A. He was interviewed by Erin J. Aubry.

<TEXT>
<P>
 I've been running about 11 years. I decided to train for the L.A. Marathon at 
17. I ran it in 1989 even though I didn't have a number; everyone encouraged me 
to do it. I didn't train that much, I just did it on my own. I just had the 
motivation. I felt real good about finishing. I figure I can sit and tell my 
children about this one day. 
</P>
<P>
 I know I can win the next L.A. Marathon. I have a lot of obstacles to 
overcome. I used to drink, and I stopped. When I was young, I used to hang 
around gangs. But I would never hit nobody. I would never fight. I got 
influenced to steal a couple of times; I've seen some shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 I prayed a lot. I believe in Jesus. It's something to do to stay out of 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 I took up running to stay out of trouble and make something out of myself. I 
tried to hurt myself once; I was full of anger. I got kicked out of school 
because I had a knife on me, and I was playing around with it and got caught. 
</P>
<P>
 I was in a special class and people teased me. I also didn't have much money. 
When I accepted Christ I started to feel better about myself. As long as we're 
alive, we're going to make mistakes. And I wasn't hanging out with the right 
people: they did drugs, spray-painted things. But I started resisting. 
</P>
<P>
 I got shot for wearing a burgundy jacket (gang colors). The bullet went in my 
leg. After that, I made up my mind to do better. I started to make myself 
study, I made myself keep motivation. I used to be afraid to do a lot of 
things, like shop, but I started learning how to use things like the phone 
book. When the marathon came up, I had the confidence to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Running gives me peace of mind. Sometimes I feel like quitting, but why? I 
don't want to go back to how life used to be. I want to help people. I'm going 
to be a spokesman at the Special Olympics this year. It's amazing I was chosen. 
It makes me want to keep on going.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes I don't feel handicapped; I don't feel anything's wrong with me. 
Sometimes I think, "Aw, what's wrong with me?" But I figure everyone's got a 
handicap of some kind. 
</P>
<P>
 My art is something else that's important to me. I started messing around with 
painting about 10 years ago. I want to get real good at it, make a little money 
for myself. When I get money, I want to give it to the church, because churches 
help people.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes when I don't do well, I say, "This (running) isn't for me." But 
sometimes I'm OK. I can't worry about things, it just makes the problem worse. 
I just accept what's going on. If you don't put your heart into something, 
things don't happen. You have to be open, but if things are bad you have to be 
able to let them go.  
</P>
<P>
 I came close to death a lot. People say, "That's just luck you're still 
alive." But that was really God saying, "Wake up before it's too late."

TRACK; ELAC REINSTATES MEN'S AND WOMEN'S PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 East Los Angeles College has reinstated its men's and women's cross-country 
and track programs for the 1994-95 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean of Students Ron Dyste said the move was made to comply with Title IX, a 
1972 federal law that bans gender discrimination in athletics and all areas of 
education. The addition of cross-country and track will increase the number of 
women's sports at the school to four and the number of men's programs to six. 
It is the first phase of a plan to add five women's sports over the next five 
years at the 14,600-student community college in Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 This year the school only offered volleyball and softball to women. It 
presently fields men's teams in soccer, basketball, wrestling and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's basketball is tentatively scheduled to be added in 1995-96, followed 
by soccer, tennis and swimming in succeeding years. Only the additions of 
cross-country and track have been approved by Ernest Moreno, the school's 
acting president. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding will likely come from a $1.4-million windfall that East Los Angeles 
College expects to receive from the Los Angeles Community College District in 
the next fiscal year, thanks to a 7% increase in enrollment over the past year, 
according to Dyste. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Dyste said, football's return does not appear promising. The program 
was eliminated in April, 1993, for budgetary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bringing football back would throw the balance between men's and women's 
sports out of whack again," Dyste said. "It would be like starting from 
scratch." 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies have not fielded teams in cross-country and track since 1991. The 
sports were discontinued after the 1985-86 academic year because of budget 
cuts. They were revived in 1988-89 but suspended again three years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Economics and the past success of cross-country and track were the driving 
forces behind their reinstatement, said Athletic Director Gil Rozadilla.

NOTEBOOK; DORSEY'S WILLIAMS NETS TENNIS TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Section Individual tennis championships are usually dominated by 
players who work out on family tennis courts and practice with private 
instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 So what was a sophomore tennis player from Dorsey High doing in the Individual 
playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
 Winning. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Williams of Dorsey defeated Dylan Mann of Woodland Hills Taft, 7-6 
(7-3), 2-6, 7-6 (7-5), Thursday in the singles final at the Racquet Centre. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey, which boasts outstanding football, basketball and track stars, now can 
take pride in its tennis players. Unseeded Kendra Segura of Dorsey knocked off 
reigning champion Brahna Pastorini of Taft, 6-7 (7-2), 6-2, 6-3, for the City 
girls' individual title on Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't had a match like this in a long time, but I wanted this bad," 
Williams said about his nearly 2 1/2-hour showdown against a fellow 
10th-grader. "Dorsey has gone to the finals many times, but they never win." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 16, had beaten the 15-year-old Mann, 6-2, 6-2, in an age-group 
tournament earlier this year. He finished the season with a 17-0 mark, 
including a semifinal win over Bobak Morshed of Pacific Palisades, 6-2, 7-5, 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Johnson will not return as the Washington High football coach, saying his 
contract was not renewed. The Generals were 8-5 and reached the City Section 
3-A Division semifinals last season, where they lost to Fremont, 28-21. 
Johnson's three-year record was 16-16-1 in the Southern Pacific Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not quite sure why I was let go," Johnson said. "The principal said I 
couldn't control my players. But she would not explain to me what she meant by 
that." Washington High principal Marguerite P. La Motte did not return phone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Signings -- Michael McNeely, pitcher-shortstop for Crenshaw, signed a letter 
of intent to play baseball at University of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Track -- A recap of the State track championships held Friday and Saturday 
will appear in the June 12 edition of City Times.

 Huntington Park 5, Roosevelt 1 -- Spartan pitcher Mario Arambula limited the 
area's best-hitting team, the Roughriders, to one run on three hits Wednesday 
at Evergreen Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key was that he (Arambula) is a left-handed pitcher," said Roosevelt 
Coach Ernie Rodriguez."We couldn't get a good hit on him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans got busy at the top of the first. Two walks, an Alex Oropeza 
single and a Jaime Urnales sacrifice fly put them up by two runs. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until the fifth, with a Manny Barrios' double, that Roosevelt posed 
a threat. The Roughriders tightened the score in the sixth after Barrios drove 
in Alex Rodriguez on a single. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Spartans scored three runs in the top of the seventh on a triple by 
Juan Carrillo. ENRIQUE LAVIN

 Huntington Park withstood a seventh-inning threat to outlast Lincoln, 2-1, 
Friday at Crystal Springs Park. The Spartans will play Franklin at 4 p.m. 
Monday for the 3-A Division championship at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Carrillo pitched a four-hitter, striking out four and walking six, to 
earn his fifth victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln had only a single against Carrillo through five innings. However, 
Carrillo escaped jams in the sixth and seventh innings, giving up only one run. 
The big play came with two outs when Eddie Chavez, who had singled and reached 
second on wild pitch, tried to score on Cesar Castaneda's single but was thrown 
out at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 After loading the bases with one out in the seventh, Lincoln scored its first 
run on a wild pitch by Carrillo, who got the last two outs on ground balls. The 
Spartans scored their first run when Rolando Gonzalez doubled and scored on 
Hugo Villagrana's single in the second. In the third, Sergio Nolasco doubled 
and scored on Alex Oropeza's single. ROY JURGENS

 Franklin 7, South Gate 3 -- Self-destruction best describes South Gate's 
performance Friday at East Los Angeles College.The Rams, uncharacteristically, 
committed four errors resulting in four Panther runs. 
</P>
<P>

errors. The last miscue, a wild throw by first baseman Jesse Torres, allowed 
Franklin's Angel Navarro to come home, making the score, 7-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram catcher Danny Mojarro made it 7-3 with a two-run homer in the sixth. 
Torres, who went two-for-four, scored South Gate's other run on a home run in 
the fourth.

 Lincoln 11, Wilson 3 -- Lincoln's Cesar Castaneda went two for three with four 
RBIs on a fourth-inning grand slam Wednesday as the Tigers defeated Wilson at 
Rose Hills Playground. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaneda's bases-clearing shot gave Lincoln an insurmountable 9-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "That (pitch) had my name on it," Castaneda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Tigers had plenty of offense -- Carlos Chacon drove in three runs 
on two doubles -- they didn't need it the way Wilson played defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mules, who committed nine errors, made four in the first that led to three 
unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinch-hitter Gus Arreola put the Mules on the board in the fifth with an RBI 
double to center field. CHARLES SMITH

feisty Gaucho team Wednesday at South Gate Park.

helped give South Gate a 6-2 lead in the sixth. 
</P>

 South Gate's Richard Alcantar gave up eight hits, struck out five batters and 
got into trouble only after surrendering back-to-back doubles to Pablo Sanchez 
and Billy Dillon.

 NO WORK NO PAY: Most cities offering rewards to people who turn in graffiti 
taggers are finding no shortage of tattlers. But Garden Grove officials say 
people are getting big bucks for little effort. So they've come up with a new 
system. . . . You get paid along a sliding scale: $500 if you actually testify 
in court against a tagger and he is convicted, $400 if they nail him but don't 
need your testimony. If you report an incident and only help identify the 
culprit, it's $50 to $100, depending on the graffiti damage. 
</P>
<P>
 CELEBRITY-ITIS: Barbra Streisand may be the biggest celebrity in our midst, 
but others are en route. Priscilla Presley is at the Crazy Horse in Santa Ana 
today and former actor John Gavin will be at the Richard Nixon Library & 
Birthplace Monday night. Both are for serious causes. Presley's at an afternoon 
benefit for babies with disabilities. Gavin, former U.S. ambassador to Mexico, 
is among speakers at a D-day political forum. 
</P>
<P>
 ANCIENT ART: Buddhist culture has much interest here. Nearly half the local 
Vietnamese Americans are Buddhists, as well as many other Asian Americans. The 
Bowers Museum is excited about its new 37-piece exhibit that opens today, 
"Buddhist Images in Gilt Metal." The pieces, on loan from the Chang Foundation 
in Taipei, date back to the 14th Century. . . . "It's a rare look at art that's 
this old," says chief curator Armand Labbe. The exhibit will run through Sept. 
18. 
</P>
<P>
 BUTTER UP: It's not often that you get a chance to churn your own butter in 
Orange County. But that's among the activities today at the annual Heritage Day 
festival to celebrate western history at the Oak Canyon Nature Center in 
Anaheim Hills. . . . Spokeswoman Margaret Henke says, "The kids get a chance to 
experience the West and do the things that settlers used to do." Such as: 
cross-cut sawing, weaving, calligraphy, and storytelling. Also a little 
pony-riding.

CHILD-PROTECTION SYSTEM FAILED IN FLORIDA, DOOMING TASHIA, 11; ABUSE: 
ALLEGATIONS HAD BEEN MADE SINCE CHILD WAS 3; SHE WAS NOT REMOVED FROM HER 
FAMILY UNTIL SHE WAS 9. BY THEN, SHE HAD AIDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON WORD, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Tashia came to live with Carl and Arlene Shipley, they knew that her life 
had been hard and that her death would come too soon -- that this 9-year-old 
girl had AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were things -- unspeakable, ghastly details -- they did not know. 
</P>
<P>
 "She trusted us enough to start telling all these horrible stories," Arlene 
Shipley said. "And we would have to sit at the dinner table and hear the most 
horrendous things come out of this child's mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 In her short life, Tashia had been neglected by her mother, molested by her 
mother's boyfriends, physically and emotionally abused. From the time she was 3 
years old, officials of the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative 
Services heard allegations of her mistreatment. 
</P>
<P>
 They investigated each complaint -- and then returned the girl to her mother 
or grandmother, until she was doomed. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, Tashia lost her life. She was as much a victim of Florida's bumbling 
social services bureaucracy as of the deadly virus. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a day when they could have saved her life and it didn't happen," 
Arlene Shipley said. "This child didn't have to die like this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1986, police were called to a domestic disturbance involving 
Tashia's mother, Rosemary Fisher. A neighbor involved in the complaint told 
police the child grabbed his penis and said that her mother's boyfriend taught 
her to do that. But Tashia denied any sexual abuse and the case was closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks later, Tashia's mother was accused of giving her little girl to a 
stranger. Health and Rehabilitative Services placed Tashia in a temporary 
shelter. A report said she exhibited "inappropriate sexual behavior" by 
demonstrating sexual intercourse with anatomically correct dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Counseling was ordered. Tashia was returned to her mother with the 
recommendation that the child not be left in the care of men; a psychological 
evaluation of Fisher in November of that year found her to be mildly retarded 
with "very poor parenting skills." 
</P>
<P>
 To settle the abandonment case, Tashia was placed with her maternal 
grandmother in February, 1987. HRS staffers made periodic visits for about a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1988, the HRS determined Tashia had been physically abused, 
probably by her mother. Although the girl was in her grandmother's care, she 
often stayed with her mother, reports said. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, Tashia was diagnosed with herpes and gonorrhea. A medical report 
also noted damage to her hymen and vagina. The HRS concluded she was the victim 
of "chronic sexual abuse." Later, she was found to have syphilis and venereal 
warts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police were unable to arrest a suspect for sexual abuse until February, 
1992, because of the mother's denials that she left the child alone with any 
particular men and because of the child's inability to identify a perpetrator," 
a grand jury report issued in January, 1993, stated. 
</P>
<P>
 Levon Bernard King, one of Tashia's mother's boyfriends, was charged with 
capital sexual battery for assaulting the girl. He was sentenced to 10 years in 
prison after pleading no contest to a charge of attempted sexual battery. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court and police files, Tashia said that King placed his penis on 
the child's vagina and and lay on top of her. The abuse took place before 
Christmas, 1991. Tests showed King was not infected with the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Tashia was diagnosed with AIDS in February, 1992. HRS said she contracted AIDS 
and other sexually transmitted diseases from her mother's boyfriends. Tashia's 
mother also has been diagnosed with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tashia finally was taken from her mother when a caseworker found Tashia had a 
fever of 105. Her mother had no plans to seek medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to locate Tashia's mother for this story were unsuccessful. She does 
not have a telephone. Neither the HRS nor Arlene Shipley could provide an 
address. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1992, Tashia -- timid, frightened, given to hiding in closets and 
hoarding food -- came to live with the Shipleys, her foster parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't want to give you to us, as a first foster child," Arlene Shipley 
said in a letter to Tashia, after the child's death. "I told them that you were 
the child God had chosen for us. Why else would a childless, white couple in 
their 40s, married 18 years, suddenly decide: 'Gee, we need to take in a 
discarded, little African-American girl who is dying of AIDS.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Shipleys never knew how long Tashia would endure -- doctors had 
predicted she would live four months -- they planned a party every month. 
</P>
<P>
 Arlene Shipley and Tashia flew to California to visit with Roseanne Arnold and 
watch a taping of the television show "Roseanne." The Shipleys took Tashia to 
Disney World and made weekly trips to a restaurant, where Tashia could eat crab 
legs, her favorite food. 
</P>
<P>
 Arlene Shipley proudly spread her photos of Tashia over a monstrous green 
chair and hassock -- Tashia as an angel last Halloween; Tashia sitting on 
Santa's lap, the first time she recalled celebrating Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Tammy Anderson, a legal services counselor, recalls spending seven hours 
fixing "Little Miss Tashia's" hair with beads and dreadlocks before a 
court-allowed visit with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a tough little girl. She wanted what she wanted. She prided herself 
on looking nice. She was a little Southern belle," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of the time Tashia was in foster care, she had to take more than 20 
medicines daily, including an AIDS drug. 
</P>
<P>
 "She couldn't play outside. She couldn't run. She couldn't ride a bike. 
Physical activity left her tired out," Arlene Shipley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tashia knew she had a disease she could die of. Toward the end, she knew she 
had a disease she would die of. But she did not know the name of her disease. 
All we said was she had bad blood and she accepted that." 
</P>
<P>
 Tashia questioned the Shipleys about God and heaven. She decided heaven was 
like Disney World and God was like Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told her there was no pain in heaven. She would have a brand-new body in 
heaven," Arlene Shipley said. "God would protect her and no one ever would hurt 
her again. And that she could slide down the rainbows." 
</P>
<P>
 Her battle with AIDS ended two years to the day that she had moved in with the 
Shipleys. Tashia died after an unofficial "adoption" ceremony was performed in 
the hospital to make the Shipleys her mommy and daddy. She was 11 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was so afraid that we wouldn't find her in heaven if she wasn't Tashia 
Shipley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe Tashia chose to die that night," Arlene Shipley said. "I said, 
'Tashia, you know . . . that the minute you want to be in heaven, that you 
can't take it here anymore because you hurt so bad, all you have to do is ask 
God and he will take you to heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am so grateful for the privilege of having this child in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Four months before Tashia died, First Coast Advocates Inc., a nonprofit agency 
appointed as Tashia's guardian, filed a lawsuit on her behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a case where a child did not have to die," said Jacksonville attorney 
S. Grier Wells, who filed a lawsuit against the HRS alleging "negligence in the 
performance of its duties" in failing to protect the young girl. Any money 
collected from the lawsuit will go to help other children like Tashia, Wells 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's handling of Tashia's case led to a grand jury investigation in 
early 1993. It called the lack of action "inexcusable and shocking." 
</P>
<P>
 "Allowing the child to remain unsupervised in the mother's house is analogous 
to allowing the child to walk a tightrope without a safety net; additional 
abuse was certain to occur," the grand jury's report said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of Tashia's case, said Lee Johnson, HRS district administrator, 
the agency is more responsive and aggressive. Case workers now are required to 
check prior abuse reports when a new complaint is made. Children are removed 
more quickly from abusive situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her life cannot pass without having some meaning," Johnson said. "Her life is 
a beacon shining a light on the terrible result of child sexual abuse and 
AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 But Arlene Shipley remains embittered at a system that fumbled the life of a 
little girl. At one point, in her frustration, she had called Jim Towey, 
secretary of Health and Rehabilitative Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want you to come here," she said, "and look this child in the eyes so that 
when she dies. . . . I know somebody who is part of the system has this child's 
soul on their conscience."

SMOKING FOUND TO ESCALATE RISK OF BREAST CANCER DEATH

 Smoking escalates a woman's risk of dying from breast cancer by at least 25%, 
according to a study that also says women can eliminate that increase by 
quitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Smokers were 25% more likely than nonsmokers and ex-smokers to die of breast 
cancer, according to a recent American Cancer Society survey of 604,412 women 
who were initially free of cancer.After six years, 880 had died of the disease, 
which strikes one in eight U.S. women. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk grew with the number of cigarettes a woman smoked, culminating in a 
75% greater risk among women who smoked two packs a day or more. Quitting would 
return a former smoker's risk to that of a lifelong nonsmoker, researchers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 46,000 women will die this year of breast cancer, the second-most 
common cancer killer among women. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugenia Calle, an epidemiologist who directed the American Cancer Society 
research, said the study does not suggest that smoking causes breast cancer. 
Instead, she said the increased risk may result from "poorer survival or 
delayed diagnosis." 
</P>
<P>
 "For example, smokers may have impaired immune systems, they may not obtain 
routine (mammograms), or smoking may cause a direct deleterious effect on 
survival," Calle said.

ABORTION ANOTHER SAD CEAUSESCU LEGACY; ROMANIA: DICTATOR'S PROHIBITION, IN A 
MISGUIDED EFFORT TO INCREASE THE BIRTH RATE, MADE SECRET OR SELF-INDUCED 
TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY THE PRIMARY MEANS OF BIRTH CONTROL.

 Nelu Craciun got home from work one afternoon to find neighbors nursing his 
wife. An hour later she died, of complications from a self-induced abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea she had tried to make an abortion," said Craciun, 34, now left 
alone to raise five children. "When I left in the morning, she told me not to 
go drinking and to come home early." 
</P>
<P>
 Radita Craciun may simply have been too poor to seek a medically supervised 
abortion, but it is just as likely she was a victim of the confusion about sex 
and birth control that is one of Nicolae Ceausescu's sorriest legacies. 
</P>
<P>
 The communist dictator's prohibition of abortion and contraception, in a 
misguided effort to increase the birth rate, made secret or self-induced 
abortions the primary means of birth control. 
</P>
<P>
 More than four years after Ceausescu's fall and execution, modern 
contraceptives are available, but few people buy them. Abortion remains the 
most popular, and dangerous, method of birth control. 
</P>
<P>
 "These women are used to doing abortions," said Dr. Doina Bologan, a 
gynecologist at the Health Ministry. "It is a question of mentality. They don't 
realize they can die." 
</P>
<P>
 According to official records, deaths related to abortion have fallen since it 
became legal, from 545 in 1989 to 86 last year. The number of legal abortions 
soared last year to 600,000, or more than two per live birth. In the United 
States, by comparison, there are three live births for every recorded abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to promote modern contraception methods, financed by a $9-million loan 
from the World Bank, have had little success. 
</P>
<P>
 Health Ministry officials say their surveys indicate 42% of women of 
reproductive age do not practice contraception. Of those who say they do, only 
13% use such modern methods as birth-control pills, intrauterine devices or 
condoms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have democracy now and every woman can choose," said Dan Poenaru, a 
government official. But women's-rights and family planning groups contend that 
freedom of choice means little in a vacuum of information. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of myths and misunderstandings," said Dr. Mihai Corciova of 
the Society for Education in Sex and Contraception. "Although it's easier for 
the young to ask questions now, we haven't succeeded with middle-aged people." 
</P>
<P>
 Bologan of the Health Ministry agreed that the lingering effect of 
communist-era propaganda has been diffcult to counter. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a campaign that the pill gave you cancer, and it is very difficult 
to change that to explain that it can be beneficial," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One result is that "95% (of patients) say they prefer abortion to the coil or 
the pill," said Dr. Petru Mercut, director of the Philanthropic Hospital in 
Bucharest. 
</P>
<P>
 Doreta Lecoiu, 39, who has two children and was waiting at the hospital for 
her second abortion in four years, said her doctor "told me an abortion is 
better than contraception." 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 abortions are performed at the hospital every day on women up to 12 
weeks pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Riste, a 27-year-old mother of four, had traveled 10 miles from the 
village of Jilava for an abortion, her seventh since they became legal after 
the 1989 revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she could not afford more children in Romania's post-communist 
economic climate of high inflation and unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 Her next comment suggested that Romania's abortion mentality may be changing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am afraid of the coil, but I've had enough of these abortions," she said, 
and promised to try contraception.

UNHERALDED VETERANS FOUND IN AUSTRALIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Col. Ike Austin, "champion rifle shot of the world," astonished Australian 
audiences in the 1880s with his William Tell act, shooting apples off his 
wife's head and potatoes out of her mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Then his aim got shaky and his wife walked out. He fell into poverty and died, 
just another unheralded American who had fought in the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 Unheralded, that is, until Roy Parker, a retired U.S. Air Force major, and 
colleagues in the private American Civil War Research Group found his unmarked 
grave in a Sydney cemetery under his true name, Isaac Putnam Smith. They 
honored him with a headstone supplied by the U.S. Department of Veterans' 
Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of American veterans came to Australia after the Civil War, to seek 
their fortunes in the gold fields, because the Confederacy lost, or because 
they were fleeing either the law or bad marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker and his friends, driven by a fascination with history and compassion 
for the forgotten veterans, started tracking them down 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 When the quest began, only three graves of Civil War veterans had been 
identified in Australia. Parker's group has found 90 more and obtained 30 
plaques and tombstones from the U.S. government for those that were unmarked. 
</P>
<P>
 The most colorful of all was Smith, a sergeant in Company G, 84th New York 
Infantry (14th Brooklyn), who was an expert rifle shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Adopting the stage names, and rank, of Wild Ike and Col. Ike Austin, Smith 
earned the great sum of 100 pounds a week performing with the St. Leon Circus, 
Later, he leased a pavilion at the Bondi Beach aquarium, where his stray shots 
would vanish over the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 "Col. Ike Austin, the American marksman, is at present shooting potatoes out 
of his wife's mouth and driving tacks into a board," the Bulletin magazine of 
Sydney reported in March, 1889. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any drinking gentleman who wants the pimples shot off his countenance and his 
hair cut with ammunition at 50 yards range will please apply to the colonel at 
once." 
</P>
<P>
 Wild Ike wowed crowds in Australia, England, Europe, India, Shanghai and Hong 
Kong, performing such feats as knocking the ash from a cigar held in a 
companion's mouth, piercing a deck of cards held in a bystander's hand and 
snuffing out lighted candles. 
</P>
<P>
 Ike's aim finally failed, his wife left and his fame faded. He spent his last 
10 years in a nursing home for the poor and went to a pauper's grave. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker and his friends found their way to Smith's grave through word-of-mouth 
tales, obituaries after his death in 1908 and an 1899 U.S. government pension 
list. He now has a tombstone of Alabama marble and a place of honor in Rookwood 
Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 George Johnston Fairweather, of the 4th Maine and later the 19th Maine, 
survived the fiercest battles of the Civil War only to die in Australia, also 
in 1908, as a lonely bachelor. 
</P>
<P>
 "This poor old man, they found him dying in a hut near Bowral" southwest of 
Sydney, Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The constable came out in the middle of a winter's night, in the wind and 
rain, and picked him up and took him by wagon 24 kilometers to the Bowral 
hospital, where he died of pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had nothing on him but a letter to the U.S. consul," Parker said. "The 
letter said he had been in the Civil War, mentioned all the battles and men in 
his regiment, and he was wondering about his pension." 
</P>
<P>
 Fairweather survived the First Battle of Bull Run, the siege of Williamsburg, 
Second Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Gettysburg, the Wilderness and half 
a dozen lesser engagements. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Parker said, "The poor old guy, he had no friends or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has information about Mexican War or Civil War veterans who went to 
Australia can reach Roy Parker at 41 Churchill Road, East Killara, New South 
Wales, Australia 2071.

POOR ISLANDS SEE AN UNDERSEA GOLD MINE; SOUTH PACIFIC: LEADERS HOPE THE EXPERTS 
ARE RIGHT AND THAT EXPLOITING THE MINERAL RICHES WILL TRANSFORM THEIR 
ECONOMIES, NOW AMONG THE WORLD'S POOREST.

 For as long as Tongans can remember, oil has oozed from the soil of Tongatapu 
island in sticky black puddles. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of miles away, specks of gold appear among the grains of beach sand 
under the coconut palms of Vanuatu. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of nodules of rare minerals are spread on the sea floor around the 
Cook Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Geologists believe the South Pacific is a treasure-trove of mineral deposits. 
Island governments hope the experts are right and that exploiting the riches 
will transform their economies, now among the world's poorest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't know enough about what is out there," said Philipp Muller, head 
of the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission, the regional agency for 
mapping resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been some promising results, but so much is still unexplored. 
We've only just scratched the surface. This is a real frontier for 
prospectors." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the island nations are dispersed archipelagoes that subsist on 
coconuts, fishing and tourism but have economic rights to vast areas beyond 
their shores. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiribati, for example, is 33 coral atolls scattered on both sides of the 
Equator and International Dateline. Although its total land mass is only 313 
square miles, its exclusive economic zone covers 2.2 million square miles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be marvelous for island countries to have undersea resources found 
and exploited," said Ieremia Tabai, a former president of Kiribati who now 
heads the South Pacific Forum, the main political and economic group in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 Muller sees oil as the brightest prospect, even though a 25-year search has 
met little success, and counts on new exploration technology. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen promising sites have been identified just north of Fiji in 
Bligh Water, named for Capt. William Bligh, who sailed through in a small boat 
200 years ago after the Bounty mutineers cast him adrift. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bligh Water and other places, geologists believe, oil formed in sediments 
deposited more than 20 million years ago and is trapped in the porous rock of 
ancient coral reefs thousands of feet beneath the seabed. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other tantalizing mineral prizes are nodules of manganese, copper, 
nickel and cobalt that formed over millions of years on the ocean floor around 
the Cook Islands, west of Tahiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Such deposits would be worth several fortunes on land, but it is difficult -- 
and so far uneconomic -- to go after them 13,000 to 19,000 feet down, where the 
water pressure is immense. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology is being developed, however, and Muller said undersea mining "is 
just around the corner." 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers from the University of Hawaii plan to test undersea mining 
equipment next year, at a depth of 5,250 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 China, Japan, South Korea and India also are developing techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Undersea mining was tried unsuccessfully in the 1970s, between Hawaii and 
California. Keith Crook of the university's Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory 
said it will become feasible as demand and prices increase and mineral deposits 
on land diminish. 
</P>
<P>
 He envisions huge floating platforms controlling machines or robots on the sea 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The land already has yielded some wealth, notably the oil wells and huge gold 
and copper mines of Papua New Guinea. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold has been mined in Fiji all of this century and there are plans for a huge 
open-pit copper mine.

INDEPENDENT TEXANS SHUN FARM SUBSIDIES

<P>
 Ray L. Stewart figures he does well enough, thank you, without a government 
check for the corn and wheat he grows on more than 3,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can't make more money out of a block of land than what the Yankee 
government can pay me for it, I need to find me something else to do," said 
Stewart, 64, waiting for a black sky to drop some rain. 
</P>
<P>
 More than sheer cussedness keeps Stewart away from federal support payments 
that cost $16 billion last year. By accident and design, farm programs have 
become less attractive for many growers. 
</P>
<P>
 Farm and budget bills since 1985 have nudged farmers toward the market and 
away from the government for guidance in their planting decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Tight money and a Congress that is less sympathetic to agriculture will 
probably produce a 1995 farm bill with even fewer dollars to go around. 
</P>
<P>
 Change is at work in McLennan County. Here, enamel-green expanses of early 
corn and milo compete with the soft coral, lavender, pink and yellow stipple of 
bordering wildflowers for the eye's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Growers here like to plant acres, not idle them. They'll lease any small patch 
as long as it's big enough for a cultivator or combine to do its work. Step 
three feet off a driveway, and you can be up to your knees in oats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always figured that in a normal year, you can make more money by farming 
land than by laying it out," said Stewart, using the farmer term for idling 
land in exchange for government benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Growers get most government help from deficiency payments. Payments make up 
the difference between a target price set by Congress and the market price. 
</P>
<P>
 In years when surpluses are expected, farmers are told to limit how many acres 
they can plant in a "program crop" like corn, wheat or grain sorghum, also 
called milo. 
</P>
<P>
 An extra 15% of the land gets knocked out of payments for a budget-saving 
program called flex. Flex also encourages farmers to try other crops on those 
acres. 
</P>
<P>
 No acres are being idled this year because of shortages caused by the 1993 
floods in the Midwest and drought in the Southeast. But growers here have other 
problems that will keep county participation in the corn program close to 50%, 
compared with a national average of closer to 80%. 
</P>
<P>
 Growers get payments for historical yields, not real production. The 1985 farm 
bill froze those yields at levels from a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Growers everywhere have gotten better at producing corn. That's especially 
true in McLennan County, where farmers have switched in a big way from cotton 
and milo to corn. 
</P>
<P>
 Program yields are down near 35 bushels an acre, while farmers can reap 85 to 
157 bushels, said Henry A. Hahn, who farms in nearby Levi with his brother, 
Robert. 
</P>
<P>
 "We make a good crop and then we get penalized for it," said Henry, 39, using 
the break between corn planting and wheat harvesting to go after some yellow 
catfish. Like Stewart, the Hahns farm several thousand acres, much on leased or 
rented land. 
</P>
<P>
 The stigma of leasing or renting has disappeared for farmers, especially here. 
There are farm widows who don't take up the business, or doctors, lawyers and 
investors with land to spare. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is multiple owners and multiple paperwork, which helps keep Jeff 
Davis, 54, of Waco, out of the programs. Davis farms about 4,000 acres of corn, 
wheat, milo and soybeans -- a huge operation by any standards. 
</P>
<P>
 But he rents fields of anywhere from two acres to 135 from about three dozen 
landlords. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't like to see me coming down there, because I've got more landlords 
than anybody in the county," said Davis.

SIOUX CULTURE CLOUDS GIRL'S FUTURE; LAW: THE STANDING ROCK TRIBE FEARS THE 
CHILD IS IN DANGER OF LOSING HER HERITAGE. IT PLANS TO APPEAL JUDGE'S DECISION 
ALLOWING HER TO STAY WITH GUARDIAN, WITH WHOM SHE HAS LIVED NEARLY ALL HER 
LIFE.

 Kayla American Horse's hopes seem simple enough: to stay in Kentucky, play 
basketball, join the cheerleaders and serve on the safety patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 But her future is anything but simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven-year-old Kayla is at the center of an increasingly bitter custody fight 
that pits Loni Rye, the Kentucky woman who reared her from the age of 8 months, 
against the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 The tribe claims Kayla as a member -- and argues that she belongs with her 
people. Too many children, the Sioux say, are adopted off the reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is, Indian children are the lifeblood of Indian tribes," said 
Steve Moore, a senior staff attorney with the Native American Rights Fund of 
Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 The population base is diminishing due to these cases, he said. "The very 
vitality of tribes are threatened." 
</P>
<P>
 All Kayla wants is to be a kid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm scared," Kayla whispered. "I wish this would be over." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not. Although Boyd County Circuit Judge C. David Hagerman awarded 
custody to Loni Rye in April, the tribe has promised to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Rye says when she first saw Kayla on the reservation in 1984, the girl was 
clothed in nothing but a filthy T-shirt. Kayla's mother, now known as Effie 
Iron Road, was an alcoholic and admitted she couldn't care for Kayla. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother signed custody of Kayla over to Rye and her ex-husband, Kim Weasel, 
who is Kayla's uncle and a member of the tribe. A tribal judge later appointed 
them legal guardians, although retaining wardship. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the intervening years, Rye said, the tribe showed no interest in Kayla. 
When Rye asked for financial assistance three years ago to have a hole in 
Kayla's heart repaired, the tribe refused. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seems to me to be kind of a self-serving proposition," said Gurney 
Johnson, Rye's attorney. " 'Now the child's well and happy, so we want her 
back.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Standing Rock Chief Tribal Judge Mike Swallow said the tribe had no reason to 
be concerned about Kayla until October, when Rye and her husband filed for 
divorce. He feared that without Weasel, Kayla would have no tribal influence in 
her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Rye said that was absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she took Kayla and her other two children, who also are on the 
tribe's rolls, to powwows and other cultural events. Rye, who is of Cherokee 
and Choctaw descent, has also given the children books about their heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the Sioux people," she said. "They're wonderful people." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the custody fight has gotten ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 In arguing that the case not be transferred to the reservation, Johnson 
described "deplorable" conditions in some Sioux foster homes. And Swallow cited 
a petition circulated in the Ashland area that accused the tribe of wanting 
Kayla merely for "a government check and for breeding purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 Swallow argued that Kayla was still a ward of the tribe, and that the case 
should have been transferred to the reservation, which straddles the North 
Dakota-South Dakota border. But Hagerman maintained jurisdiction because Kayla 
and most of the witnesses in the case live in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 While not discounting the bond between Rye and Kayla, Moore said there are 
"competing factors that come into play" in Indian custody battles. 
</P>
<P>
 Toby Grossman, senior staff attorney for the American Indian Law Center in 
Albuquerque, N.M., said there are several hundred such cases pending each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman could not say how many of those children are returned to the 
reservation. But when most tribes number in the low thousands, even one case 
"is terribly significant," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They look at one child as important to them, and people have to understand 
that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 was passed to help reduce the 
number of adoptions off the reservations. Moore of the Native American Rights 
Fund said the law is so full of loopholes as to be nearly ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 He said nearly half of the estimated 1.96 million people of American Indian 
ancestry live off the reservations. That puts tribal courts at a great 
disadvantage in custody cases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been an obvious effort by state court judges to create loopholes and 
exemptions (in the act), to the point that I believe Congress needs to take the 
matter up again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rye is preparing for a long fight for Kayla. She has contracted with Los

SURGERY AIDS EMPHYSEMA PATIENTS; MEDICINE: VOLUME REDUCTION REMOVES 20% OF 
DISEASED LUNGS IN SEVERE CASES. IT'S NOT A CURE, BUT IT CAN MAKE SOME 
TRANSPLANT OPERATIONS UNNECESSARY, PROPONENTS SAY. 
</P>

 Lynn Marantz suffered so much from emphysema she couldn't even walk and talk 
at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a horrible life," she said. "The worst part was that I couldn't laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 That was until the 43-year-old Chicago woman underwent an operation called 
volume reduction that removes from 20% to 30% of the diseased lungs of 
sufferers of severe emphysema and improves their ability to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure was developed by Dr. Joel Cooper, professor of cardiothoracic 
surgery at the Washington University School of Medicine. Cooper, who pioneered 
lung transplant operations, says volume reduction could make some of those 
surgeries unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've never had the disease, you can't imagine how it feels," said 
Marantz, who recently was back at Barnes Hospital for a checkup a year after 
undergoing the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I laugh at the slightest excuse," she said shortly after a brisk walk on 
a treadmill. "I'm enjoying just being alive. That's not a small thing." 
</P>
<P>
 People who undergo the operation have an average improvement in their lung 
function of 70% to 90%, Cooper said. That's a sharp improvement in the quality 
of life for the majority of the 20 patients who've had the operation in the 
last 15 months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper presented the results of his research recently in New York during the 
annual meeting of the American Assn. of Thoracic Surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Other doctors say the procedure is so new they have yet to see much data on 
it. But they like what they have seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The results of (Cooper's) research . . . are surprisingly promising," said 
Dr. Norman Edelman, consultant for scientific affairs for the American Lung 
Assn. and a professor at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper says many people now on waiting lists for lung transplants have 
emphysema, a severely debilitating, progressive disease that afflicts an 
estimated 1.65 million Americans. It's caused primarily by smoking, but there 
are an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 cases in the United States in which it was 
caused by an inherited protein deficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 Emphysema sufferers have to struggle for every breath and eventually must 
depend on supplemental oxygen until even that isn't enough to keep them alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a blown-up balloon, healthy lungs shrink to normal size when air is let 
out of them. Emphysema robs the air sacs in the lungs of their elasticity, 
which keeps them from deflating and causes other damage. As time goes on, 
sufferers must take deeper and deeper breaths to get even a little fresh air 
into the functioning part of their lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 This causes the lungs to grow and enlarges the chest cavity. The ribs are 
spread apart, and the diaphragm, which is important to normal breathing, 
becomes flattened into the bottom of the chest cavity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you how it feels," Marantz said. "Take a deep breath and hold it. 
Then, when you need to take another breath, don't breathe out, but try to take 
more air in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terrible, isn't it? That's how I used to have to fight for every breath I 
took." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, who performed the first successful single lung transplant in 1983, 
said his experience in transplants led to the new procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Volume reduction is not a new concept," he said. "But when it was first 
proposed 35 years ago by Dr. Otto Brantigan, it was considered a crazy notion." 
</P>
<P>
 Brantigan, a surgeon with the University of Maryland and Baltimore City 
Hospital, performed a number of similar operations with at least some success. 
But the early mortality rate of 16% overshadowed any gains and the procedure 
never gained widespread acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 But technology and techniques have changed radically since then, Cooper said, 
noting that lung transplants once were believed to be impossible too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I noticed that immediately after transplant surgery the patient's chest 
returned to nearly normal size and the diaphragm returned to its normal 
position," he said. "That made the idea of volume reduction less crazy. Now we 
know that it's very workable, with the right team and the right techniques." 
</P>
<P>
 Volume reduction isn't for everyone, though, Cooper warned. 
</P>
<P>
 "To begin with, it's major surgery," he said. "I make the same incision that 
would be made for open heart surgery so that we can see both lungs. But it can 
be done safely, and it can be done on people of all ages. Our first 20 patients 
ranged in age from 39 to 76. All are still living." 
</P>
<P>
 So far only two patients have required further surgery to correct minor 
problems, Cooper said. Hospital stays for the 20 ranged from seven to 48 days, 
and recent improvements in stapling techniques are making for shorter stays. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Cooper and Edelman stress that the final results aren't in on the surgery 
and that only time will confirm what seems to be a positive step for many 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The patients still will have emphysema, and the disease will progress, Cooper 
said. But the procedure can be used as a "bridge" to buy time for people who 
eventually need a transplant when a donor becomes available, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It also can be an alternative for many people on the current transplant list, 
Cooper said. Transplants should be the last resort because of the fear of 
rejection and the problems the required immunosuppressant drugs can cause, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time for a transplant is the day before it's too late," Cooper said.

 There's a mistake on a new souvenir stamp sheet from the U.S. Postal Service

</P>
<P>
 Mark Compton of Affton, Mo., wrote a letter to Linn's Stamp News pointing out 
the mistake. The publication already had pointed out that the stamps, which 
commemorate the 1994 World Cup soccer championship, omit one tournament site 
and misidentify four others.

 Japan has agreed to build a floating treatment facility to help Russia dispose 
of the liquid nuclear waste it has been dumping into the Sea of Japan, a 
Foreign Ministry official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The two governments agreed that Japan would pay for most of the plant's cost 
with money from a $95-million grant Tokyo has already extended to Russia for 
dismantling nuclear warheads, the official said.

ABRASIVE STYLE CITED AS ENVOY TO PARAGUAY IS CALLED HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The State Department, in a highly unusual move, has quietly yanked career 
Foreign Service officer Jon David Glassman from his job as ambassador to 
Paraguay only a few months before his three-year tour was to have been 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Glassman, a national security aide to former Vice President Dan Quayle, was 
summarily bounced by Assistant Secretary of State Alexander F. Watson and 
principal deputy Michael Skol around mid-February and was given until April 30 
to leave Asuncion. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials insist that the move had nothing to do with 
Glassman's identification with Quayle or his authorship of a controversial 
"white paper" that the Ronald Reagan Administration used to "prove" that the 
Salvadoran rebels were Cuban and Soviet puppets. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that the problem was mostly one of style. The hard-charging 
Glassman had been U.S. charge d'affaires to Afghanistan and closed the U.S. 
Embassy there in 1989. He was sent to Paraguay by President George Bush. Word 
is that he was too undiplomatic in leaning on the Paraguayan government to 
crack down on drug smugglers and money launderers. He had simply stepped on too 
many toes too often. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said the Paraguayan government had twice sent senior officials to 
Washington in recent months to complain and press for Glassman's removal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply lost confidence in his reporting" on the situation in Paraguay, an 
Administration source said, adding that Glassman's departure "has been a long 
time coming." Bush Administration officials also had been unhappy with his 
performance but took no action before the Clinton Administration came in, that 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
 While style may have had much to do with the decision, there appears to have 
been a substantive dispute as well between Glassman and the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Glassman reportedly pushed to have the newly elected Paraguayan government 
branded as noncooperative with U.S. antinarcotic efforts in the South American 
country. Other agencies working in Asuncion agreed with that assessment, a 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials here disagreed and kept Paraguay on State's "good guys" list of 
nations this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Glassman is awaiting his next assignment, which will be working in Washington 
at the Industrial College of the Armed Forces at Ft. McNair, described by one 
source as "truly Siberia."

D-DAY FRESH IN A PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN LEDERHANDLER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Martin Lederhandler, still an active Associated Press photographer after a 
record 58 years, landed on D-day with the 165th Signal Photo Company, attached 
to the 4th Infantry Division. He returned to photograph the site 50 years later 
and filed this report:  
</P>
<P>
 On D-day, I sent my film of the landing to England by carrier pigeon. But the 
pigeon got tired and was captured in Le Havre, so one of my pictures appeared 
on Page 1 of a German newspaper. They even gave me a byline. 
</P>
<P>
 When I returned to Normandy after 50 years for a friendly invasion, my 
memories seemed to fade in the mist and fog of wind-swept Utah Beach. Strolling 
along, I tried to recapture the D-day events. 
</P>
<P>
 A Belgian family's 2-year-old was playing in the sand. A hearty chef from 
nearby Carentan was flying a kite in the rough weather, using two hand 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
 Farther on was the first evidence that all of it truly had happened on that 
long-ago 6th of June: In the low tide, I spotted the rusted remains of an LCI 
(Landing Craft Infantry) left as a monument. On the dunes above the beach were 
a Sherman tank and a rusting German anti-aircraft gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Memories flooded back. 
</P>
<P>
 I was part of a unit of the 165th Signal Photo Co. attached to the 4th 
Infantry Division. My job was to record the division's activities on D-day and 
send my film back across the English Channel with pigeons that had been given 
to me in Portsmouth. 
</P>
<P>
 The pigeons, I was told, had been raced from Calais to Dover in peacetime and 
were familiar with the crossing. What I was not told was that pigeons will not 
fly -- at least not very far -- after three days in a canvas case without 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 I sent my two birds off after shooting only 10 frames on a short roll of film, 
and lightened my load by heaving their canvas traveling case overboard. I had 
more than enough other gear, what with chemical-dipped underwear in case the 
Germans used gas, a life preserver belt, pistol, gas mask, camera equipment and 
personal effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks later, I learned that one of the pigeons had landed in Le Havre, 
exhausted, and was captured by the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 In a German bunker in Cherbourg, I found a German newspaper with one of my 
pictures of our LST (Landing Ship Tank) number 282 on the front page. The 
caption gave me a byline, since I had sent my unit identification along with 
the film. It also said we were later destroyed by artillery fire. Not true. 
</P>
<P>
 Our Signal Corps units had been given six or eight pigeons to carry our film. 
Mine was the only one ever found, and the wrong people found it. Did anybody 
kid me about it? Guess. 
</P>
<P>
 On my return visit to Normandy, I toured the American Cemetery at 
Colleville-Sur-Mer near Omaha Beach, where 9,386 U.S. soldiers are buried, 350 
of them unidentified. The names of 1,557 Americans missing in action are listed 
on a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 In La Cambe, a nearby town, I went to a cemetery where 21,160 German soldiers 
are buried. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years ago, the sea and sky were filled with 1,000 ships and 1,000 planes 
carrying 250,000 soldiers to free a continent. 
</P>
<P>
 Many thousands of men died, on both sides. A plaque at the entrance to the 
American Cemetery admonishes, fittingly: "Silence and Respect."

GARY FIGHTS 'MURDER CAPITAL' TAG; URBAN RENEWAL: INDIANA COMMUNITY ONCE WAS A 
LIVABLE CITY; ITS PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE IT SO AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON LESKO, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When your decaying hometown is known as the deadliest place in an increasingly 
dangerous nation, what do you say in its defense? 
</P>
<P>
 You can point to the past, to the nostalgic "Gary, Indiana, my home, sweet 
home" from "The Music Man." You can point to the future, and hopes that 
riverboat gambling will end two decades of socioeconomic free fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as many longtime residents do, you can shrug your shoulders. No one denies 
that Gary has the highest murder rate in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they say somebody died and you go check it, there's a body there. That's 
real, so we're not in denial as a community," said Councilman Chuck Hughes, 
chairman of the City Council's Public Safety Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it would be sort of a miscarriage of justice if people believed that this 
is a Roaring '20s, Wild, Wild West town without all of the other fine things 
that go on in other communities. It's just not true." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary once was a livable city, and its people are struggling to make it a 
livable city once again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's home," said Sheryl Freeland-McGrady, a Gary native and special assistant 
to Gov. Evan Bayh. "And home is home, regardless of where it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Founded by U.S. Steel Corp. Chairman Elbert Gary in 1906, Gary was once a 
thriving city. Longtime residents remember crowds of shoppers along Broadway, 
and gridlocked traffic during shift changes at U.S. Steel. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, with its main gate just a few blocks from City Hall, once 
employed about 30,000 people. The region had 60,000 steel-making jobs at its 
peak, and related industries employed thousands more. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only guy in those days who didn't have a job was the guy who didn't want 
one," said Fire Chief Benjamin Perry, who once worked in the Gary mills. 
</P>
<P>
 But migration to the suburbs hurt in the 1960s and 1970s; the collapse of the 
steel industry was a civic disaster in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone were jobs and businesses that buttressed the tax base and gave the 
community reason to feel good about itself. In their place came a drug war that 
took its desperate soldiers from the streets, and often left them there to die. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think the entire problem is economics. Pure and simple," said Perry, 
a third-generation Gary resident. "People don't have any money, and they will 
do what's necessary to get on with their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary now is the crumbling home to 119,125 people, down from a peak of about 
188,000 in the early 1970s. Michael Jackson is the most famous of those who 
left, and he rarely associates himself with his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, U.S. Steel employs fewer than 7,000 people, and the region's mills 
employ about 31,000. Downtown Gary largely is a desolate strip of vacant, 
boarded-up buildings. There are no hotels -- the vacant Sheraton looming over 
City Hall is a symbol of hard times -- and the only major store is a K mart. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary's unemployment was 12.8% in December, the last month figures were 
available, compared to 6% nationally and 4.8% in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a community desperately in need of support," said Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had 110 homicides last year, 27 more than in 1992 and four more than 
its previous high in 1973. Although official FBI figures are not yet available, 
Gary officials readily acknowledge the city's 1993 murder rate of 91 per 
100,000 residents probably was the highest in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, Gary's rate was 55 per 100,000 when it last led the nation, in 
1984. Washington topped the homicide list in 1992 with 75 per 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Thomas Barnes has asked President Clinton for 100 new police officers to 
bolster the current force of 220 officers and about 75 auxiliary officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're talking about providing officers for cities in need, and Gary gets 
the distinction of being No. 1 (in homicides), who would be more deserving?" 
asked Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Gary is depending on federal help. Residents are organizing block 
patrols and cleaning up their neighborhoods. The Main Street Organization is 
working to spruce up downtown, with one plan calling for local artists to paint 
murals over boarded-up storefronts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that there are enough people that are affected on a daily basis by 
the violence on the streets, that it's possible that they can make a 
difference," said Rebecca Bordt, criminology instructor at the University of 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary boosters point to its proximity to Chicago, the picturesque Lake Michigan 
shoreline in the cuddly Miller section, and the affordability of comfortable 
homes in Miller and the few other neighborhoods untouched by decay. 
</P>
<P>
 They are encouraged by plans to open the first Indiana riverboat casino this 
summer -- one of two allowed in Gary by act of the Indiana Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverboat gambling, Barnes said, is "our best opportunity in 40 years to 
unlock the door to job creation and economic opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue from the boats could boost the city budget by 50% or more, and the 
boats alone are expected to create more than 2,000 jobs. The city also is 
seeking land-based projects, including hotels, restaurants and entertainment 
such as theaters, golf courses and museums. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a shiny convention center and fitness center amid the downtown 
squalor. And the city plans to expand the airport -- designated as a foreign 
enterprise zone -- into a major cargo hub. 
</P>
<P>
 But what if new jobs and revenue do not stop the violence? 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody seems to say it's opportunities, it's jobs, and that might in fact 
be the answer," Hughes said. "When we get these riverboats in and a larger 
segment of our population is employed, then we'll be in real danger if we don't 
see a significant decrease in crime."

GAY DAY AT DISNEY WORLD GOES OFF WITHOUT INCIDENT, PARK AIDE REPORTS

<TEXT>
<P>
 An unsanctioned Gay Day at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom went off without 
problems, a park spokeswoman said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It went fine.We had a lot of people with that group," said Jane Adams, a 
Disney spokeswoman. "I have no idea exactly how many, because it's hard to tell 
who's with the group and who isn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers had expected as many as 20,000 homosexuals to visit the park in 
what has become the unofficial kickoff to local celebrations of Gay Pride 
Month. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs in front of ticket booths notified visitors that a gay and lesbian group 
would be visiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams said there were a few complaints from visitors who were unaware of the 
event. She said she did not know the exact number. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some Christian activists had mounted a media campaign against the 
event during the last few weeks, there were no protesters outside the park 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 David Caton, director of the American Family Assn., said he decided several 
weeks ago not to have protesters at the park on the day of the event. But he 
said his group did send a few "non-confrontational observers."

SALVATORE GRAVANO IS FBI'S FAVORITE 'SONGBIRD'; MAFIA: MOBSTER GOES FROM THE 
GAMBINOS' NO. 2 MAN TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S NO. 1 INFORMER. IN RETURN, THE 
MOST HE WILL SERVE IS 20 YEARS, OR ABOUT 54 WEEKS FOR EACH PERSON HE ADMITS 
KILLING OR ARRANGING TO KILL. MAYBE LESS.

<P>
 Nineteen murders as a mobster, 14 convictions as a star witness. Salvatore 
(Sammy Bull) Gravano has proved almost as deadly working for the Justice 
Department as he was working for the Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
 In less than 2 1/2 years, Gravano has gone from the Gambino family's No. 2 man 
to the federal government's No. 1 informer. The unflappable Gravano has handled 
hundreds of questions on the witness stand, but two big ones remain unanswered 
as his midsummer sentencing approaches: 
</P>
<P>
 Will his work pay off in a sharply reduced jail sentence? 
</P>
<P>
 And, if so, what kind of message will that send? 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutors and FBI agents who worked with Gravano say that the stocky, 
tough-talking killer has earned a break, and that a reduced sentence will 
persuade other mobsters to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers say Gravano's agreement for a 20-year maximum term already 
sends a disturbing message: Cutting a deal with the government means absolute 
absolution, with no repercussions no matter what the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government, to use the vernacular, makes offers that people can't 
refuse," said Gerald Lefcourt, a prominent defense lawyer. "People will say 
anything to avoid a mandatory life term." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is what Gravano, 48, was facing -- life without parole. His deal with 
prosecutors guarantees the most he will serve is 20 years, or about 54 weeks 
for each person he admits he killed or arranged to kill. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of those victims is long, from Gambino family boss "Big Paul" 
Castellano to turncoat soldier "Tommy Sparrow" Spinelli. 
</P>
<P>
 But the list of convicted organized crime figures jailed with Gravano's 
assistance is almost as long and even more impressive: Gambino family boss John 
Gotti. Gambino consigliere Frank Locascio. Colombo family boss Victor (Little 
Vic) Orena. Gambino family capos Thomas Gambino, James (Jimmy Brown) Failla and 
Robert (Bobby Cabert) Bisaccia. 
</P>
<P>
 Gravano was an unlikely candidate for the Witness Protection Program. He was 
fiercely loyal to Gotti, and was seated beside the Dapper Don when Castellano 
was gunned down a half-block away on Dec. 16, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 When Gotti became the nation's most notorious mob boss, Sammy became his 
underboss. Gotti was the Gambino family's bark; Gravano was its brutal bite. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bull was persuaded to switch sides by government surveillance tapes that 
captured Gotti bad-mouthing his underboss. "Sammy told me, 'I knew even if I 
was acquitted, because of what John said, I'd have to kill him,' " recalled 
James Fox, ex-head of the FBI's New York office. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors were not keen on accepting Sammy, convinced their cache of 
secretly recorded tapes was enough to convict Gotti without the problems of 
cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Sammy cooperated, I had mixed feelings," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Laura 
Ward. "Those tapes killed Gotti. Up until then I thought, how can you cross 
(examine) a tape?" 
</P>
<P>
 But tapes don't guarantee convictions. In 1990, Gotti walked on a charge that 
he ordered a hit on a union official despite a recorded conversation where he 
said, "We're gonna, gonna bust him up." 
</P>
<P>
 Gravano helped avoid a repeat, moving quickly from unlikely to devastating 
witness. Federal officials say they were overwhelmed by the eighth-grade 
dropout's honesty, memory and testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been fantastic," gushed Ward, who has worked with Gravano since he 
turned. "He really is phenomenal. He's not an actor. He's very bright." 
</P>
<P>
 And very effective. His track record: 14 convictions, including five plea 
bargains in April. One acquittal. One hung jury -- and that case will be 
retried this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also a key witness against the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and 
Joiners, an allegedly mob-controlled union that cut a March deal giving the 
federal government control of the organization for 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Gravano testified at the sentencing of Venero (Benny Eggs) Mangano -- a 
71-year-old Genovese captain who received a stiff 15-year prison term. With 
five bodyguards in tow, he testified before a U.S. Senate subcommittee on 
organized crime's involvement in boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gravano is a prosecutor's dream," Fox said. "He has a photographic memory." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Castellano hit, Sammy was able to provide incredible detail, right down 
to the outfits worn by the triggermen: "White trench coats and black Russian 
hats." 
</P>
<P>
 Gravano has proved unshakable on cross-examination, outlasting some of the 
nation's top defense lawyers and their tactics: Albert Krieger and his sarcasm, 
Bruce Cutler and his bombast. This Krieger question, from the Gotti trial, is 
typical: 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't care what happens?" Krieger asked Gravano in mock disbelief. "Let 
the jury come in guilty, let the jury come in not guilty. Means nothing to you. 
That's what you are telling the court and the jury, correct?" 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way," Gravano coolly responded. "They're the jury. And I'm not a juror." 
</P>
<P>
 Gravano doesn't even need to testify to land some guys in jail. Two of the 
Gambino family's top captains -- Failla and Daniel Marino -- both took 
seven-year prison terms in an April 5 plea bargain rather than hear Sammy sing. 
</P>
<P>
 "People make him out to be a dumb thug, a killer," said Fox. "My experience is 
he has some pretty good damn common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gravano story, laid out during nine days on the witness stand at Gotti's 
racketeering trial, is fairly simple. He grew up in Brooklyn, dropped out of 
grammar school, served two years in the Army, and started a life of crime that 
never stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Gravano started small -- "armed robberies, burglaries, shylocking," he 
testified. He graduated to "murder, shylocking, construction." He became 
friendly with an up-and-coming Gambino family thug known as "Johnny Boy" -- 
John Gotti. 
</P>
<P>
 When Gotti ascended, Gravano received his reward: An annual illegal income of 
$250,000 to augment his reported construction business earnings of more than 
$500,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he awaits another kind of payment from the government. Gravano has one 
last criminal case to handle: The trial of reputed Genovese family boss Vincent 
(The Chin) Gigante. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Dist. Judge I. Leo Glasser will then decide to give Gravano the full 20 
years or something less.

UNPREPARED STATES FROM MAINE TO TEXAS PREY TO KILLER STORMS; DISASTER PLANNING: 
AS THE HURRICANE SEASON BEGINS, DOZENS OF COMMUNITIES ARE ILL-PREPARED FOR 
CATASTROPHE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the 1994 hurricane season opens this month, years of complacency have left 
significant sections of the East and Gulf coasts vulnerable to death and 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Communities from Maine to Texas remain ill-prepared for the killer storms that 
could spin out of the Atlantic this summer and fall. 
</P>
<P>
 While an Associated Press survey of emergency directors in hurricane states 
noted a surge in federal concern and a growing professionalism among local 
officials, it also found troubling gaps in readiness: 
</P>
<P>
 * A number of states still await detailed computer projections that can 
accurately predict storm flooding from an approaching hurricane. Puny federal 
funding is the culprit. 
</P>
<P>
 * In some jurisdictions, the crucial role of hurricane planning and emergency 
coordination is filled by part-timers with tiny budgets. One county emergency 
director could not even recall his evacuation routes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some evacuation routes are frail and untried. They include flood-prone 
highways and choke points along bridges and causeways. When tested, some routes 
have clotted in bumper-to-bumper traffic that would be at the mercy of an 
onrushing storm. 
</P>
<P>
 In Palm Beach County, Fla., emergency director B. T. Kennedy fears a 
bottleneck where 18 northbound lanes on the turnpike and I-95 collapse into 
five. This could freeze the traffic flow headed north from Miami and Ft. 
Lauderdale. He imagines a hurricane "overtaking this gridlock and causing an 
enormous number of casualties." 
</P>
<P>
 "This scares the hell out of us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency has tried to help, tripling funds for 
hurricane programs to $2.8 million this year, with plans to push it past $7 
million in 1995. But Director James Lee Witt admits it will take time before 
the money buys results. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have a long way to go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attempt to revitalize the nation's hurricane program comes after a 30-year 
lull in storms that took the urgency out of storm preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 This lethargy often meant perfunctory appointments and limited budgets. In 
many communities, the role of emergency manager has been designated a volunteer 
position or an addendum to a county employee's job description. 
</P>
<P>
 The AP survey found many counties staffed with full-time directors who have 
received extensive training from FEMA and the National Weather Service 
Hurricane Center. 
</P>
<P>
 But for some emergency directors, the job is just a sidelight to other careers 
-- among them, seafood wholesaling, teaching physical education and working in 
a paper mill. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Pierce, the emergency management director for Franklin County in 
Florida's Panhandle, has an offbeat take on how he got the job. "I guess I had 
all my teeth," he said. "I got it because at the time they were looking to fill 
the position, mostly responding to FEMA requests." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, the county planner, admitted his experience in emergency management is 
"very limited." He said his rural county does not have an evacuation plan 
because there is only one way out. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Miller, the emergency planner for Nueces County, Tex., had trouble 
recalling evacuation routes or the name of his counterpart in Corpus Christi, a 
city of 260,000 in his jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, the county's building maintenance director, has a tiny hurricane 
budget. The county conducts no public education program to prepare the public 
for a storm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't spend a lot of time on emergency management myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Parker has had training in nine years as the volunteer emergency 
management director for McIntosh County, Ga., but evacuating 9,500 people won't 
be easy. Escape routes are limited, and a computer that provides crucial storm 
data was damaged by a falling ceiling. There are no funds for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money is a problem in a small county," Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government has also been guilty of under-funding hurricane 
preparedness. For years, FEMA's annual hurricane budget was an unwavering 
$896,000. By comparison, $22 million was spent on earthquake programs last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Stingy funding slowed a program that provides highly accurate, computerized 
projections of where a storm's flood surge will strike. 
</P>
<P>
 They were valuable tools when Hurricane Hugo hit South Carolina in 1989, and 
again in 1992 when Andrew savaged Homestead, Fla. Deaths were kept to a minimum 
as officials, using the data, moved people out of harm's way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the key to knowing who has to move, where and when, and whether the 
roadway system is safe," Kate Hale, emergency management director for Dade 
County, Fla., said of the evacuation plans. "It really helps you understand and 
correct misperceptions about the areas of vulnerability." 
</P>
<P>
 But only 13 of 34 coastal regions have up-to-date evacuation studies. 
</P>
<P>
 High-risk areas in the Carolinas and northeast Florida and big population 
centers, including Massachusetts and Rhode Island, still await original or 
updated plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Connecticut evacuation study, just completed, was begun seven years ago. 
Other regional studies, including Alabama, Mississippi and parts of Texas, must 
be redone to incorporate booming populations and development. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the years, the studies were given just enough money to sustain them, not 
complete them," said Dan Catlit, the earthquake and hurricane program manager 
for FEMA's New England region. "It wound up costing a lot more money for no 
results." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with completed plans, local officials have few opportunities to run 
full-scale drills. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people wanted the chance to improve their state of readiness, but in 
the past we didn't have the resources to help them and they couldn't get it out 
of their local budgets," Catlit said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some areas found flaws in their plans the hard way -- real life evacuations 
from threatening storms: 
</P>
<P>
 * As Hurricane Andrew approached the Louisiana shore in 1992, officials 
ordered a mandatory evacuation of low-lying areas in Iberia Parish. Within 
hours, northbound Highway 90 became a 50-mile parking lot because traffic 
lights in Lafayette had not been turned off. Even after the lights were fixed, 
it took a precious two hours for the gridlock to ease. 
</P>
<P>
 * As Hurricane Hugo traveled up the East Coast in 1989, residents fleeing the 
Georgia coastline found themselves locked in bumper-to-bumper traffic that 
extended the 170 miles from Savannah to Macon. 
</P>
<P>
 * A federal review after 1991's Hurricane Bob found a disjointed reaction 
along the Connecticut shore. Local officials, according to the report, "took 
different preparedness actions even though each community faced the same 
hazard. . . . In fact, some communities conducted evacuations the evening of 
Aug. 18, some on the morning of Aug. 19, and some made no public evacuations." 
</P>
<P>
 Some planners have few choices about how they can evacuate residents. They are 
handicapped by limited highway access and vulnerable routes that could be shut 
down by the outriders of a storm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to tell you it takes a rocket scientist to plan the evacuation 
routes, but a 10-second examination of the map shows you how few options we 
have," said Hank Christen, Okaloosa County director of emergency services whose 
piece of the Florida Panhandle has only two roads out. 
</P>
<P>
 Major urban areas and tourist spots are also at risk: 
</P>
<P>
 * If low-lying sections of the major highway out of Brownsville, Tex., were to 
flood, about 110,000 residents would be left with a two-lane highway as their 
only alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 * All roads out of Ft. Myers, Fla., converge on the tiny cattle town of 
Arcadia, population 6,002. "We're talking 300,000 or more people heading to 
Arcadia," said Wayne Sallade, Charlotte County emergency director. "To me, it 
could be the biggest bottleneck ever seen -- but what option do we have?" 
</P>
<P>
 * Those evacuating barrier island resorts fear what would happen if bridge 
traffic to the mainland jammed. Clay Stamp, emergency director for Ocean City, 
Md., conceded that his detailed time estimates for moving 300,000 tourists over 
two slender bridges could easily go awry. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't monitor the storm close enough and make the decision at the right 
time, we could get behind the eight ball," he said. "Traffic could get backed 
up, and you may have people evacuating during storm conditions. At some point, 
people would be instructed to stay where they are and seek shelter." 
</P>
<P>
 But shelter will be hard to find in some places. 
</P>
<P>
 In New Orleans, where an estimated 100,000 people have no personal means of 
transportation, officials are working on a plan to bring thousands to a staging 
area -- perhaps the Superdome -- where they could be transported out of the 
city by bus or railroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Eichhorn, assistant director of emergency preparedness, admits the plan 
would be a huge undertaking, probably best handled by the military. 
</P>
<P>
 "They move divisions at a time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Florida Keys, the Monroe Detention Center on Stock Island will be 
refuge for three nursing homes and people with special medical needs. 
</P>
<P>
 If things really go wrong, the Keys have a "refuge of last resort" program. 
Structures along the evacuation route have been identified as having the best 
chance of surviving a hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could stop traffic and direct those people on the highway to those 
facilities in a last effort to save their lives," said Billy Wagner, emergency 
director for Monroe County. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency planners themselves may have to seek shelter. Many command centers 
are in courthouses, municipal buildings and jails that have been flooded by 
past hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
 With most of Norfolk, Va., vulnerable to flooding, officials have designated 
backup centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the event we have a severe storm, I think we can count on pretty much 
losing communications," said Troy Lapetina, the city's emergency service 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal authorities hope increased funding and a new emphasis on hurricane 
programs will lighten some of these grim scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Shea, FEMA's director of mitigation, said additional monies will double 
the pace of the program providing computerized storm data to states. Other 
funding will be used to hire statewide hurricane coordinators. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA has set up a command post at its Washington headquarters, where a 
collection of federal agencies will monitor a storm's approach and then 
coordinate relief efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking to the future," Shea said, "to the next hurricane season and 
beyond." 
</P>
<P>
 But the new technology still points up present weaknesses in the system. 
</P>
<P>
 In the FEMA war room, computers provide a bird's eye view of the U.S. 
coastline so detailed you can see how many people over 65 live along the 
boardwalk in Atlantic City, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Technicians summon up street maps highlighted by magenta and lime hues of 
demographics. The map shows the causeways to the mainland that carried in 
tourists to casinos even as Hurricanes Bob and Gloria approached and where toll 
collection jammed the traffic of those trying to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast are the lines showing how far into the resort's crowded streets 
the ocean would rampage if a Category 4 hurricane, one level short of 
catastrophic, ever struck. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the flood zone, three blocks from the ocean's edge, is police 
headquarters, where city officials would run emergency operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Allyn Seel, the city's assistant emergency management director, speaks with 
confidence about the building's steel-reinforced walls, generator and emergency 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unlikely, but not impossible, this building could be lost," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kate Hale, the Miami emergency management director who has seen what 
hurricanes can do, is skeptical about Atlantic City's hubris. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to know," she said, "if they have ever seen a submarine made out of 
brick?"

ROME FELL ON D-DAY MINUS 2, JUNE 4

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Allies took the Eternal City of Rome June 4 -- two days before D-day. In a 
sight that became common across Europe, excited citizens cheered as troops 
marched through the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. John M. Hennessy Jr. wrote his sister that an emaciated woman ran over 
to him, holding out a battered can of Vienna sausage. "This is the only thing 
of value that I have," she told him. "I've been saving it to give to the first 
Allied troops that I saw." 
</P>
<P>
 Hennessy wrote his sister, Doris Winkler of Burbank: "I started to cry because 
those people were so hungry, in rags and tatters. She must have been tempted to 
eat it a hundred times." 
</P>
<P>
 Slightly more than a month later, Hennessy was dead, killed in battle at the 
Arno River, where the German troops had retreated. The nearby city of Florence, 
160 miles north of Rome, did not fall to the Allies until Aug. 13.

DANA PARSONS: WOMAN TO PURSUE BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE IN VIETNAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mary Payne Nguyen is hearing that inner voice again. Feeling that rhythm in 
her soul telling her it's time to go. 
</P>
<P>
 If life's not an adventure, then what is it? And if packing up and leaving 
America for Vietnam isn't an adventure, then what is? 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of this summer, Mary Nguyen will have resettled in Nha Trang in 
south-central Vietnam with her 24-year-old adopted Amerasian son and three 
natural children, ages 9 to 14. Her natural children's father, from whom she is 
divorced, is Vietnamese. In that sense, her children will be returning to a 
country that is part of their heritage, but there is much more to Mary Nguyen's 
story than that. 
</P>
<P>
 She is an American woman whose family settled in California in 1949. Her 
parents were active in the post-World War II refugee movement and as a young 
girl she instinctively knew she would adopt children when she grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, in addition to giving birth to nine children, she and her 
husband adopted 14 others. Altogether, they fostered more than 30 children. 
Most of her adopted children are Vietnamese, but Nguyen has been most 
identified in Orange County for her efforts in helping Amerasians -- those 
children fathered by American servicemen during the Vietnam War but largely 
abandoned and often scorned afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, for reasons that are part practical and part personal, Mary Nguyen is 
going to Vietnam. A large, heavy-set woman with reddish-blond hair, she jokes 
that she will not slip into Vietnam unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never felt strange in Vietnam," she says in her Huntington Beach home. 
"I feel very comfortable, very at home, and that's weird because as you can see 
I'm not the common thing you see in Vietnam. I stand out everywhere I go and 
cause quite a stir everywhere I go. They really don't know quite what to make 
of me. That can open a lot of doors." 
</P>
<P>
 She's taking a year's leave of absence from her adult-education teaching job 
with the Garden Grove Unified School District. The truth is, she's hoping to 
settle permanently in Vietnam. 
</P>

 "I'm going back for a quality of life that I'll never be able to find here," 
she says. "I think we've lost it here in Southern California, frankly. The 
violence scares me, the guns. Children committing crimes really frightens me. 
Somewhere along the way, we've lost the balance of authority. The values have 
kind of gotten twisted and off-kilter." 
</P>
<P>
 The oddity, perhaps, is that her children's Vietnamese-born father is 
remaining in California. And yet, Nguyen thinks her children will benefit from 
going to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they need to be in touch with who the other half of them is. 
Amerasians came to their father's country. Vietnam is my children's father's 
country and they deserve to know, I think." 
</P>
<P>
 I suggest it's ironic that she's leaving America in search of a better life, 
since history says it's supposed to work the other way around. "I'm not saying 
a better life, materially," she says. "I'm talking about values. It's really 
hard in Orange County to get in touch with what's really important. Kids want 
to go to the mall on weekends, hang around the malls. What is that? We've got 
people all over the world dying for lack of food and the children in the 
province we're going to -- they estimate 800 to 900 orphans. There's an 
orphanage there with 37 children." 
</P>
<P>
 I ask what she thinks her children will learn there. "They will understand 
that there is more to life than how many TVs you have. What's really important 
-- if you're comparing buying a new whatever set of POGs or games for videos or 
feeding hungry children and providing them with someplace to live? What's 
really important here?" 
</P>
<P>
 Her words may sound scornful of American society, but that isn't how it comes 
across in person. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't see this as leaving here, as picking up and going. I see this 
as going to Vietnam. I didn't say, 'It's time for me to get out of here and 
where should I go' and then choose a place to go. That wasn't it at all. If it 
wasn't Vietnam, I'd be staying here. I feel driven, somehow, to go to Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Nguyen's age (she'll be 50 in August), Vietnam has formed part of 
the backdrop of her life. A friend was a POW and several other friends were 
killed in the war. And she did marry a Vietnamese man. But always in the 
background was her lifelong belief she would adopt children. 
</P>
<P>
 Why so many? "It's a tendency of mine to do the maximum. When the need is so 
tremendous and not enough people are doing their share, I tend to take on more 
than I should, probably. It upsets me to see so much need and people not coming 
forward. That's been a real problem for me with Amerasians in the U.S. I've 
been appalled at the lack of response of the American people to Amerasians, 
because I expected Americans to really stand up and help these kids, because 
they are, in fact, American kids. And they've been deprived of all the things 
American kids should expect to have." 
</P>
<P>
 Once in Vietnam, she plans to continue working with orphans. She already has a 
contract with an adoption agency and she's also involved in an ongoing 
Amerasian program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will be able to make a real mark, a difference," she says. "My mission in 
life is to leave it better than when I got here. It's real hard to make that 
kind of a difference here, but I can make that kind of difference over there."

FESTIVAL CROWDS MUSIC TO OJAI'S EARS; CONCERTS: THREE PERFORMANCES TODAY WILL 
BRING CURTAIN DOWN ON THE 48TH ANNUAL EVENT. PERCUSSION ENSEMBLE KEEPS THE BEAT 
SATURDAY. 
</P>

<P>
 During the Ojai Festival, Scott White can step outside his home in the cool 
evenings and listen to the violins sing and the French horns swoon from nearby 
Libbey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 But Saturday, the only sound White could hear was the chorus of car motors and 
the murmur of human traffic as music aficionados filtered into Ojai for the 
48th annual music fest, which concludes today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hell," White said of the hot midday traffic crunch he encountered trying 
to drive along Ojai Avenue to the dry cleaners. "Compared to a normal Saturday 
it must be four or five times the amount of cars." 
</P>
<P>
 About 5,000 people were expected to attend the three-day concert series, which 
started Friday evening and is one of the nation's most prominent music 
festivals. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Michael Tilson Thomas leads the New World Symphony of Miami in 
three concerts today, the last of which begins at 5:30 p.m. in Ojai's Libbey 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 But the crescendo of activity in the normally quiet town could not sour 
White's tone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still like having the music festival," White said. "Despite the traffic, 
it's a nice event." 
</P>
<P>
 And the invading concert-goers couldn't agree more. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't beat the setting and the weather's perfect," Camarillo resident Dee 
Dee Tamburrino said. "All you need is a blanket and a shady tree." 
</P>
<P>
 Tamburrino and her friends hit Ojai early Saturday, eating breakfast at a 
nearby cafe before attending the 10 a.m. family concert, featuring SouthBeat, 
the New World Symphony's percussion ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park residents Jean and Chris Curtis brought their 5-year-old son, 
Patrick, to Saturday morning's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fabulous," Jean Curtis said. "Patrick is real interested in music; he 
was captivated the whole time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Curtises were hesitant about bringing their youngster to the music 
festival, fearing he would be bored or restless. But the ensemble's flamboyant 
drum banging and musical storytelling mesmerized the 375 people in the 
audience, many of them children. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick said his favorite part of the performance were the xylophones. 
</P>
<P>
 "They banged on them really hard and really loud," the 5-year-old said. "I 
think that's cool." 
</P>
<P>
 But some festival-goers aren't as enthused by the discordant and often 
avant-garde music that the festival strives to include in its novel musical 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been coming for about 25 years," said Pacific Palisades resident Olga 
Farbstein. "We used to come for the concerts . . . (but) they're getting a 
little too modern for my tastes." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the festival's emphasis on progressive music, Farbstein said she 
returns year after year because she loves the ambience of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Her friend, Rosalind Loring, who has been coming to the festival for about 10 
years, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always go to the Philharmonic in Los Angeles, but it's a very different 
experience to sit here under the oak trees," said Loring, who lives in 
Westwood. "We never miss it and we never leave without buying something." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's music to the ears of local merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai's art galleries and restaurants typically profit off the weekend crowd. 
The Ojai Festival is one of the town's largest events. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be a crazy weekend," said Pamela Pilkenton, a saleswoman at 
Massarella's pottery shop and gallery. "A lot of people who come in here from 
out of town already have pieces and come back to add to their collection. 
They've kind of become fans." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street, a monstrous breakfast crowd descended on the Ojai Cafe 
Emporium before the 10 a.m. concert. "It was packed," hostess Kelly Brown said. 
"All the tables were full." 
</P>
<P>
 Human Arts owner Hallie Katz said she expects her gallery to double its normal 
business during the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "This weekend could be comparable to a weekend before Christmas," she said. 
"We really gear up for it."

CAMARILLO HOSPITAL GALLERY DISPLAYS THE ART OF HEALING; THERAPY: PIECES BY 
MENTALLY ILL AND DISABLED PATIENTS ARE NOW ON PERMANENT EXHIBIT NEXT TO THE 
STATE FACILITY'S STUDIO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Scary faces peered from the black and purple swirls that Kerry S. painted on 
her first canvasses. A young woman struggling to control the multiple 
personalities competing for her mind, Kerry expressed her anguish and confusion 
in art. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, her work is an explosion of pastels, pale greens blending into luminous 
yellows and oranges, dolphins leaping from a bright blue sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerry looks at these pieces, hanging in a new art gallery at Camarillo State 
Hospital, and sees the progress she has made in five years of therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors to the gallery, who pay $75 to $150 for Kerry's pastels, see 
something more -- luminance and calm, an undeniable joy. 
</P>
<P>
 Art buyers are snapping up the work that Kerry and other artists have created 
in the hospital's studio for the mentally ill and developmentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of its kind in California, the gallery sold half the artwork it 
displayed on opening night in April. Directors then sent another 30 pieces to a 
special exhibit in Sacramento, where all but six have sold. 
</P>
<P>
 "The work that's done here could compete with any amateur artist," says Leslie 
Hara, co-director of the hospital's art therapy program. "You don't look at 
them saying, 'A mentally ill person must have done that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the hospital's artists have competed successfully in art shows, 
winning scores of ribbons at the Ventura County Fair. And art sales twice a 
year draw hundreds from the community, who buy paintings for as little as $1. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the program directors have gone a step further and set up a permanent 
gallery next to the hospital art studio. The studio's students painted the 
walls. A residents benefit fund bought pedestals for pottery. And the art 
frames pay for themselves with each piece sold. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the Art Equals Life gallery, selling artwork is just a sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 Far more important, therapists say, is the self-esteem the artists gain from 
seeing their work framed and displayed. The display, they say, can enhance the 
value of using art as therapy. And they appreciate the message the art conveys 
to the world outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Through visits from school and civic groups, the gallery's directors hope to 
demonstrate the productivity and talent of people whom society often shuns. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a tremendous stigma that we have to just get rid of," says Jack 
Cheney, director of the hospital's art therapy program. "Our prejudices have 
held us all bondage for centuries." 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, the mentally ill have always had a place in the art world. Every 
art history student knows the story of Vincent van Gogh, who painted some of 
his finest pieces in the asylum at St. Remy. 
</P>
<P>
 Countless other mental-hospital patients have influenced the themes and style 
of modern art, a trend explored in a 1992 exhibit at the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art.  
</P>
<P>
 Often, the tormented minds of the mentally ill summon images that others have 
repressed, making their art intriguing not only to mainstream artists but to 
casual buyers, says Stan Passy, a Santa Barbara psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they create these art projects, all of the sudden we have a chance to 
notice things that are unnoticed in society," Passy says. "I call it the return 
of the repressed, the return of the buried." 
</P>
<P>
 Passy uses art to elicit deeper feelings from clients in his ordinary practice 
and from students he teaches at Pacifica Graduate Institute in Carpinteria. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles and Orange counties, therapist Elda Unger uses art to reach 
abused children. "It just opens up a way of communicating, sometimes without 
words," says Unger, who is president of the Southern California Art Therapy 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo State Hospital started its program in 1987 as another mode of 
therapy for the mentally ill and developmentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's really a major shift from the old couch approach to psychotherapy," 
says Cheney, who started the Camarillo program. "It's much more giving the 
power back to the patients to make those creative choices in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the clients have been in and out of verbal counseling and have learned 
how to hide their feelings. "They can't hide in art," Cheney says. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 of the hospital's residents dabble with paint or clay in the art 
studio at least once a week. Some leave with a great sense of pride in what 
they have accomplished, says Hara, who worked as an artist before joining the 
hospital staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "They see what they can create," she says. "It gives them other options to 
feel good about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Other artists, such as Jane H., use the studio as a release from their 
illness. A schizophrenic, Jane says painting and playing the piano quiet the 
voices in her head. 
</P>
<P>
 Her canvasses hang on one wall of the gallery, large abstract scenes with 
colorful shapes and lines. "This one is Cubist," says Jane, who says she 
received formal art training. She spent years selling art on the streets of 
Pasadena, but never received the kind of notice she has at Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the gallery hang pastels by Kerry S., who like many artists there use 
only her last initial. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kerry's artwork, the sun always shines. Rainbows stretch across the canvas. 
Shades of pastels rise skyward in a joyous profusion of color. 
</P>
<P>
 "That type of joy couldn't have come quite so profoundly out of a place that 
didn't have conflict," Cheney says. 
</P>
<P>
 When she first came to the hospital, Kerry exhibited the classic signs of 
severe retardation and cerebral palsy. Suddenly one day, another personality 
emerged and it became clear that her true problem was multiple personality 
disorder, Cheney wrote in an article about Kerry. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first day in the art studio, Kerry appeared prim and rigid, anxious about 
starting a drawing, Cheney recounted. "I don't know what to do," she cried at 
the time. "Isn't someone going to help me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Another day she arrived giggling like a child and thrusting her hands into 
cans of red and yellow paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Her early art reflected the torment of childhood neglect. She drew pictures of 
dark, forbidding castles and forests filled with dead trees and eerie faces. 
She also drew pictures of horrifying childhood experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Her work in the art studio helped bring out many of the memories Kerry had 
repressed for years. That, in turn, helped her integrate her many 
personalities, Cheney says. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Kerry has practically become a student-teacher in the art studio, 
spending hours each day helping others work with clay or paint. Hospital 
administrators have commissioned her to do pieces to match their conference 
rooms. And she is preparing to leave the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so different now than it used to be," says Kerry, 39, gazing at her 
pastels hanging in the gallery. "There's lighter, brighter colors. I guess I'm 
getting better." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Art Equals Life Gallery at Camarillo State Hospital will be open from 9 to 
11 a.m. and 1 to 5 p.m. daily. The studio holds its semi-annual art sale 
beginning at noon June 25. For information, call (805) 484-3661 and ask for the 
art studio.

D-DAY MEMORIES; COUNTY'S VETERANS LOOK BACK WITH PRIDE AND PAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

 Lawrence (Ed) McCarthy of Camarillo knew it was going to be a big mission when 
he heard they were serving steak and eggs in the officers' mess on the morning 
of June 6, 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bedridden at a military hospital in Bodney, England, with what doctors feared 
was an appendicitis attack, the 22-year-old U. S. Army Air Force first 
lieutenant missed the breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 But McCarthy promised himself that he wasn't going to miss this mission. The 
long-awaited time for the D-day invasion had finally come. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in the hospital and heard over the radio that all able-bodied men were 
to report to their units," McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't in the pain I was the day before, so I talked to the doctor and he 
agreed to release me. I had a sense of what was about to happen and I didn't 
want to miss it." 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours later, McCarthy was at the controls of his P-51 Mustang fighter, 
skimming over the turbulent English Channel at just over 300 m.p.h. He and his 
fellow members of the 328th Fighter Squadron -- known as the Blue Nosed 
Bastards of Bodney -- were headed for Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 Assigned to a divebombing mission designed to prevent the Germans from 
reinforcing their beachside positions, McCarthy had no idea how big the 
invasion force would be. 
</P>
<P>
 But as he approached the French coastline at an altitude of about 500 feet, he 
was awe-struck at what he saw in the water below him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It almost looked like you could walk across the ships, there were so damned 
many out there," McCarthy said. "It was nothing short of amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy said that as he was approaching the invasion site, his thoughts were 
focused on the location of the Allied troops beneath him, the weather and his 
low altitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were given a 20-by-20-mile sector to cover," McCarthy said. "We were told 
that if anything moved within that area we were to take it out. We did." 
</P>
<P>
 On D-day and the weeks that followed, McCarthy flew roughly twice the number 
of sorties he normally flew in support of the Allied invasion force as it 
advanced through France and into Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the custom that if you completed a mission you could get a ration of 
two ounces of what we called combat whiskey, " McCarthy said. "But at that time 
we were practically living in our flight suits. We'd come back, eat and then 
sleep. We didn't have the time or the energy to drink." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 153,000 American and Allied soldiers combined to strike at five 
separate beaches on the Normandy coast that morning, backed up by an armada of 
5,000 ships and more than 12,000 aircraft. In all, the Allied invasion was the 
largest amphibious assault force the world has ever known. 
</P>
<P>
 And, the losses suffered during the invasion were staggering. Nearly 6,600 
American soldiers died during during the first 24 hours of the attack, half of 
them during the first few hours of the invasion at Omaha Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Paris was liberated in August of that year, 37,000 Allied soldiers 
died in the conquest of Hitler's "Fortress Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 And for McCarthy and other Ventura County veterans of D-day, the sights, 
sounds and smells of the invasion will be forever burned into their memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman Elton of Ventura remembers the invasion like it happened yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 For Elton, then a 24-year-old British Army staff sergeant, the invasion was 
memorable not only because of its strategic importance, but also because it 
marked his first mission flying a glider into enemy territory. 
</P>
<P>
 The gliders in Elton's squadron were made of plywood, had an 88-foot wingspan 
and were capable of carrying either 30 fully outfitted troops or two jeeps. 
They were towed by aircraft until a few miles before their target and then 
released. Junked after a single flight, they were capable of landing anywhere 
and needed no airstrip. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of D-day, 250 British gliders were launched. Elton and his 
co-pilot had a cargo of two jeeps. Released by his tow plane five miles 
offshore from Normandy, the Ventura veteran marveled at the armada massing 
below him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the most magnificent sight," Elton said. "For miles you could see in 
every direction nothing but Navy ships." 
</P>
<P>
 At his intended landing site, a few miles inland from the beaches of Normandy 
near the river Orne, Elton was supposed to deliver the two jeeps to help Allied 
units protect their eastern flank. 
</P>
<P>
 As they were landing in a field, they saw a German tank. But the tank suddenly 
turned and retreated from the area, removing the threat as the glider landed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could have done a tremendous amount of damage had he stayed," Elton said. 
"The Germans weren't quite sure what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Elton, now 74, says the British glider squadrons took a beating that morning. 
His squadron lost 34 men and 17 gliders. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you saw a church tower or a steeple, 10 to 1 there'd be a German sniper in 
it," Elton said. But most of the gliders carried out their missions and their 
role in the invasion was viewed as a success. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the first time we had used such a big concentration of gliders. I 
think we took them by surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 When the landing craft carrying Bob Tanner of Camarillo lowered its main door, 
he expected to find the sand of Omaha Beach under his feet when he stepped off 
the craft. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, like many of his comrades that day, the 22-year-old U. S. Army staff 
sergeant found himself nearly waist deep in the waves and struggling to stay 
upright with his 70-pound pack as German defensive fire from 88-millimeter 
cannons and machine guns sprayed all around him. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanner, who was with the 1st Infantry Division -- the Army unit known as the 
Big Red One -- carried a silver dollar good-luck charm with him on D-day. And 
he still believes that is why he wasn't killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of the 192 men we had in my company, 57 were killed and 24 wounded within the 
first hour of the invasion," Tanner said. "I guess you could say that my lucky 
buck worked." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanner, who participated in the Allied invasions of North Africa in 1942 and 
Sicily in 1943, said that his company was warned that Normandy would be rough. 
</P>
<P>
 But he adds that none of his comrades could have expected what they 
encountered that morning on Omaha Beach -- the bloodiest of the five Allied 
landing beaches at Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our company had a bit of a cocky attitude because of the first two 
invasions, but Omaha was a meat grinder," said Tanner, now 72. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing you wanted to do was to get away from the landing craft. You 
had to have a tough attitude that you were going to get through despite the 
fact that guys you were just talking to were dying in front of you. You just 
had to keep moving." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanner said that his company landed at Omaha at 6:30 a.m. and that it was 
12:30 p.m. before members of his unit were able to get off the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Omaha assault required the invaders to cross nearly 200 yards of open 
beach before reaching a concrete seawall at the base of some bluffs. It took at 
least five more days before his ears stopped ringing from the constant sound of 
mortar and machine-gun fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud of what we did there," Tanner said. "But we all paid a heck of a 
price. A lot of good friends of mine didn't make it out of there. They're the 
heroes, not me." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanner said that his division lived up to its battle-hardened motto that day 
-- "No mission too difficult, no sacrifice too great, nothing in hell can stop 
the 1st Division." 
</P>
<P>
 For Vincent A. Transano, the command historian of the Port Hueneme Naval 
Construction Battalion Center, the invasion was a test of courage for the Navy 
Seabees who braved German gunfire as they prepared a safe path for the landing 
craft. 
</P>
<P>
 Transano said the first Seabees ashore were members of the Naval Combat 
Demolition Units, which had the job of blasting holes through German defenses 
on the beach so that the first assault wave could land. 
</P>
<P>
 Later during the first day of the invasion, Seabees built harbors, 
breakwaters, bridges and causeways off the five Normandy beaches where no 
natural harbors or shelters previously existed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Seabees played a pivotal role in the landings at Normandy," Transano 
said. "They did all of this critical work at breakneck speed, and all the while 
under enemy fire from the ground and the air." 
</P>
<P>
 Edward J. Marolda, a military historian associated with the Naval Historical 
Center in Washington said that while other battles during World War II saw far 
more casualties, the landing at Normandy was the critical element in the effort 
to wrest Europe from the clutches of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Marolda added that Operation Overlord -- the invasion's code name -- was made 
possible only by the success of U. S. Navy forces in the Battle of the 
Atlantic, where sea lanes from the United States to England were made safe for 
the shipping of war material and troops. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the Navy, Coast Guard and Merchant Marine were able to move more 
than 1.5 million men and their equipment to D-day staging areas along the 
southern coast of England. 
</P>
<P>
 "D-day represented the beginning of the end for Nazi Germany," Marolda said. 
"Had we not succeeded there, the prosecution of the war would have been delayed 
months and thousands more American and Allied soldiers would have died taking 
back Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the risks, the exhilaration and the fear that came with being a 
part of one of the most famous assault forces in history, Camarillo's Lawrence 
McCarthy eschews the idea that he is a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud of my contribution, but I'm not a hero," McCarthy said. "My country 
was at war and she needed me. I'm pleased to be a small part of history, but 
that wasn't my objective nor was I thinking about it at the time. I was just 
doing the best job I knew how."

HAMMETT STARRED IN SAN FRANCISCO; LITERATURE: AUTHOR BROUGHT MYSTERY GENRE OUT 
OF THE DRAWING ROOM WITH SUCH YARNS AS 'THE MALTESE FALCON' AND 'THE THIN MAN.' 
THIS YEAR IS THE CENTENNIAL OF HIS BIRTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES O. CLIFFORD, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Author Dashiell Hammett, who hauled the detective story out of genteel drawing 
rooms and into the mean streets, timed it about right when he was born 100 
years ago in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Mystery writer Linda Grant says that month is when readers begin stocking up 
on books for vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammett, born May 27, 1894, will undoubtedly be on many shopping lists, since 
such classics as "The Maltese Falcon," "The Dain Curse," "The Glass Key," "Red 
Harvest" and "The Thin Man" are required reading for mystery fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammett entered this world in Great Mills, Md., described as "just a spot in 
the road" by Lois Coryell, the reference librarian for St. Mary's County, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some distant relatives still live here, but there's nothing planned that I 
know of to mark the occasion," she said about the anniversary of Hammett's 
birth. 
</P>
<P>
 The event may have gone unnoticed there, but it certainly isn't forgotten in 
San Francisco, where Hammett was first published and wrote most of his novels. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant and fellow members of the Mystery Writers of America have devoted an 
entire issue of Mystery Week Magazine to Hammett. They've also held Hammett 
panel discussions and a walking tour of the many spots in San Francisco 
associated with the author. 
</P>
<P>
 Remembering Hammett is a minor industry in his adopted city. Don Herron, 
appropriately clad in trench coat and snap brim hat, led similar treks for 18 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Now semi-retired, Herron took small groups to places where Hammett lived or 
worked and to the haunts given a life of their own in his books. 
</P>
<P>
 A must is Burritt Street, where a bronze plaque has been erected. It sums up 
in one sentence why the alley is the most popular Hammett site in San 
Francisco: "On approximately this spot, Miles Archer, partner of Sam Spade, was 
done in by Brigid O'Shaughnessy." 
</P>
<P>
 There's also John's Grill, a well-known eatery since 1908 whose most famous 
meal existed only on paper. In his search for the elusive falcon, Spade takes 
time to order "chops, baked potato and sliced tomatoes" at John's. 
</P>
<P>
 Now packed with Hammett memorabilia, John's, where the phone number is 
986-DASH, is a mecca for his fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people are lured to the tours by the movie adaptations of Hammett's 
books, Herron said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's seen the movies," he said. "Hammett made it in all media. He had 
radio shows. All were successful. The only thing I know of that flopped was a 
Nick and Nora musical that bombed." 
</P>
<P>
 Herron, author of "The Literary World of San Francisco & Its Environs," rates 
Hammett's San Francisco as "one of the great literary treatments of a city." He 
places it in the same category as James Joyce's Dublin or Charles Dickens' 
London "for its evocation of place and time, the days in the 1920s when night 
fog cloaked the hills and a certain fat man was afoot." 
</P>
<P>
 That may seem like hyperbole, but Herron's praise is added to a long list of 
kudos, including Raymond Chandler's view that Hammett "wrote scenes that seemed 
never to have been written before." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier detective novels often were refined and bloodless, with suspects 
gathered in the mansion drawing room to hear the sleuth expound logic and 
exclaim: "The butler did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, there were some tough guy gumshoes in the pulp magazines of the 1920s 
where Hammett, who died in 1961, got his start. But Hammett gave them 
long-lasting life in his books. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammett, along with Chandler, established "the tradition many of us write out 
of today, a sub-genre that is enjoying a second golden age," said Grant, a 
Berkeley author whose most recent novel is "A Woman's Place."

AGING BOMBERS AWAKEN WAR MEMORIES; WORLD WAR II: A B-17 FLYING FORTRESS AND THE 
ONLY FULLY RESTORED B-24 LIBERATOR ARE TOURING THE UNITED STATES AS PART OF THE 
D-DAY OBSERVANCE. 
</P>

<P>
 For former pilots who once flew the bombers in Europe and the South Pacific, 
it is a chance to relive the war in their minds and to share stories with 
wide-eyed grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 For others, it is a chance to see a piece of history as the world prepares to 
celebrate the 50th anniversary of D-day Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A B-17 Flying Fortress and the only fully restored, flying B-24 Liberator are 
touring the United States, making several stops in California. 
</P>
<P>
 A trip to Normandy for this week's ceremony was planned, but no corporate 
sponsor could be found to finance the $125,000 per plane cost of the trip, said 
Bob Collings, who established a nonprofit organization to restore the vintage 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like the high-profile sponsorship that race cars enjoy," Collings 
said. "It's tough." 
</P>
<P>
 The planes are owned and operated by the Collings Foundation of Massachusetts. 
They make more than 130 stops each year across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Several B-17s remain in flying condition. Some of them were seen a few years 
ago in the movie "Memphis Belle," which re-created a famous World War II 
bombing mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The B-24 bomber on tour is a replica of a plane, nicknamed the "All American," 
that served in World War II. Gunners on the original plane shot down 14 enemy 
fighters in a single raid over Linz, Austria, on July 25, 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane was lost on Oct. 4, 1944, when it was shot down over Yugoslavia. All 
of the crew survived. 
</P>
<P>
 The B-24 on tour was built in 1944 by Consolidated Aircraft in Ft. Worth, Tex. 
It flew in the Pacific until the war ended. Abandoned in India, it served as a 
patrol bomber for that country from 1948 to 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 It cost more than $1.3 million to restore the B-24, Collings said. 
</P>
<P>
 About a third of the skin and more than 400,000 rivets were replaced, along 
with a mile of control cable, all of the electrical wiring and 5,000 feet of 
new hydraulic lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Collings says the B-24 is the only such plane that is fully restored and still 
flying. It has been barnstorming across the United States since 1989, and made 
its 500th stop in February.

CUSTOMERS PONY UP BONUS AS GAS STATION ATTENDANT WALKS OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's the price of honesty? $97.50 
</P>
<P>
 When a gasoline station attendant quit in mid-shift and left a self-service 
pump turned on, motorists bypassed the chance to fill up and speed off. 
</P>
<P>
 When they found the station locked and closed Wednesday, they slipped money 
under the front door. 
</P>
<P>
 The station was unattended for almost two hours. Motorists pumped $97.50 worth 
of gas in that time. Station manager Elaine Hall counted 53 cents more than the 
amount of the day's sales.

FIRST PENSION WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE; SCANDAL AGAIN POINTS OUT DANGERS OF 
LOOSE REGULATION, PROMISES OF HIGH YIELDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The First Pension Corp. scandal moved to bankruptcy court last week, but as 
investors left angry and frustrated with little news to comfort them, the 
lingering lesson, especially in view of loose regulation at state and federal 
levels, is "let the investor beware." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say that the company, which declared bankruptcy in late April, 
allegedly enticed investors to put money into mortgages that did not exist with 
promises of extraordinarily high annual dividends of up to 28%. The Securities 
and Exchange Commission says that three company principals ran a scheme that 
used money from later investors to pay dividends to earlier ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The three top officers of First Pension last week agreed to plead guilty to 
expected criminal charges in the case and have signed cooperation agreements, 
according to Leslie Swain, assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But with federal investigators alleging that as much as $124 million of 8,000 
investors' money may have been lost, and with some reduced to networking by 
computer to commiserate over their missing pension money, the failure of First 
Pension stands as a cautionary tale in the lure of trust deeds as an investment 
offering very high real estate returns on investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoters of such trust deeds are not required by the state to have any 
special expertise in mortgage lending. And regulation is shared by two state 
agencies that do not share information; the Department of Real Estate oversees 
transactions between individual borrowers and lenders, but if trust deeds are 
broken for sale to more than one investor, they come under the jurisdiction of 
the Department of Corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Both departments say they lack resources for systematic review of such 
investment pools. This hole in the safety net in the regulatory apparatus 
meant, for example, that nobody was watching when owners of First Pension Corp. 
filed notices in 1987 contending that real estate investment pools were exempt 
from regulation as a public securities offering.  
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, as a pension administrator, First Pension was subject to auditing by 
the U.S. Department of Labor, but regional officials of that agency acknowledge 
they never got around to examining its books. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, investments in trust deeds are very risky anyway, and in need of 
tighter regulation. But the painful lesson of the scandal for individual 
investors is that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

A REAL SOLUTION TO AIRPORT PARKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re: "Short-Term Solution to Airport Parking," (May 25): There is only one 
way to solve the parking problem at (John Wayne) Airport. Don't treat it like a 
parking problem, treat it like a transportation problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution is not more parking slots or more parking lots or transferring 
long-term parking slots to short-term parking slots. The (County) Board of 
Supervisors has missed the point. We will never be able to keep up with the 
parking needs of Orange County fliers. We must have another, convenient, 
inexpensive transportation alternative.  
</P>
<P>
 The solution lies in getting people out of their cars. But a taxi costs $16 to 
go about six miles, one way. And a local door-to-door shuttle costs as much as 
a taxi. So, for example, if you can park at the airport for four days ($26) and 
it is cheaper than a taxi ($32), why leave your car at home? 
</P>
<P>
 I would love to leave my car at home, and take a $1 public bus ride to the 
airport. Hey, $2 round-trip, what a savings! But there is only one bus that 
services the airport. Only one. And that one bus is so infrequently scheduled 
and inconveniently routed, it would take me longer to use this bus service from 
my home to the airport than to fly to the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Come on, Orange County Board of Supervisors, stop thinking bigger is better 
(parking lots, that is). Instead, demonstrate the kind of leadership and 
creativity needed to provide a strong incentive for Orange County travelers to 
leave their cars at home.

BACKING CHALLENGER IN TREASURER RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It is no surprise that the Los Angeles Times has endorsed liberal Democratic 
partisan activist Robert Citron for treasurer-tax collector. The Times always 
endorses the most liberal of candidates in any race. Likewise, the people of 
Orange County regularly reject the recommendations of The Times when they go to 
the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron has never met a tax he didn't like, and neither has the editorial page 
of The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron has repeatedly used his nonpartisan office for partisan political 
purpose. He has mailed hit pieces against Republican candidates and 
participated in dirty tricks such as the use of his tax collector envelope to 
trick voters into thinking what they are receiving is an official tax bill, 
only to find it is partisan Democratic campaign mail. 
</P>
<P>
 He has hosted Willie Brown in his home for a fund-raiser and given funds to 
support Dianne Feinstein and the Democratic Party.  
</P>
<P>
 Orange Countians believe in term limits. Citron now seeks his seventh term! 
Citron has not been challenged in 23 years. Four years ago, he said it was his 
last term. He plays with the truth the same way that he gambles with taxpayers' 
money in his Las Vegas-like high-risk investment strategy. Safety and liquidity 
be damned is Citron's attitude.  
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to Citron, who has been on the public payroll for over 33 years, 
Orange Countians have the opportunity to elect talented and able certified 
public accountant and certified financial planner John Moorlach from the 
private sector.  
</P>
<P>
 I know John Moorlach as he has served with ability and distinction as 
assistant treasurer of the Republican Party of Orange County and likewise as 
the chairman of our precinct committee. He is an accomplished business 
professional and a dedicated family man. He is a keen conservative thinker. 
</P>
<P>
 John Moorlach is just the kind of anti-tax, pro-term limits leader we need in 
Orange County government.

KEEP THE GOLF COURSES IN CITY HANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Well, the time has come for the City Council of Anaheim to make up its mind 
whether to maintain the excellence of golf in Anaheim or to surrender our 
courses to an uncertain future under private operation. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's meeting, the council will decide whether to accept any of the 
proposals by private operators to take over operation of the city's two fine 
courses.It should be remembered that at the time the council ordered staff to 
send out requests for proposals, they assured everyone that unless there was a 
significant amount of revenue to be gained by privatizing, they certainly would 
not sacrifice the excellence we now enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year's budget has current golf operations contributing just under $1.9 
million to the city's general fund from two of the best municipal golf courses 
anywhere. The point is, Anaheim is getting an excellent return from our 
courses, and we are getting an excellent product. 
</P>
<P>
 To risk both by giving these courses up to a contractor would be, at best, 
shortsighted and, at worst, financially disastrous.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON CAMPAIGNING; POLITICAL KINGMAKERS,

WHEN LEGISLATORS ANOINT FUTURE LEADERS AND OFFICE SEEKERS LOAN THEMSELVES

By WILLIAM R. MITCHELL, William R. Mitchell is chairman of Orange County Common 
Cause.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Political campaigns are rarely an appealing process. This lack of public 
appeal stands in sharp contrast to the importance the results have in the lives 
of the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of public interest in campaigns is a reflection of their often 
unpleasant nature and the belief of many that the system is so corrupt that 
their vote matters little. 
</P>
<P>
 Two recent trends in campaigns that reinforce these concerns and create 
serious cause for alarm are the anointing by elected legislators of candidates 
and the financing by challengers of their own campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Medieval society operated under feudalism. The countryside was carved up by 
various feudal lords who dictated policies for peasants within their domain. 
The lords also acted in concert with other lords to choose and dispose of other 
lords. The conduct of many officeholders in Orange County resembles that of 
feudal lords: seeking to control their own and the fiefdoms of others. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not that long ago when it was unheard of for an officeholder to 
publicly endorse candidates in a primary election. Now not only are 
officeholders such as Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange), state Sen. John R. 
Lewis (R-Orange), state Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove), Assemblyman Tom Umberg 
(D-Garden Grove) and Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) endorsing 
primary candidates, they are providing large contributions and helping to raise 
funds. They are using their influence to select the party nominees in districts 
in which they are not running for office. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest political brouhaha of the year was the unseemly public squabble 
between Lord Ferguson and Lords Hurtt and Lewis over who would be the next lord 
of the 70th Assembly District. Ferguson felt that it was his prerogative to 
anoint Thomas Reinecke as his replacement lord for his fiefdom. A very 
reasonable position, if you are a lord and not a public servant. Hurtt, not to 
be outdone, has contributed $115,000 to his squire, Barry Hammond. 
</P>
<P>
 The political arrogance exhibited by these modern "lords" is astonishing. 
Worse, their efforts to anoint are not based on some ideological or political 
vision for the betterment of the residents of their respective domains. 
</P>
<P>
 On the contrary, this battle is solely about increased political clout for the 
various lords of Orange. These lords, not unlike the medieval lords, support 
candidates in order to create loyalty and fealty to the lord over party and 
peasants. Thus, citizens will find candidates even less accountable to them 
once elected. Is that even possible? 
</P>
<P>
 The second trend that is corrupting the system is the financing of campaigns 
by candidates. It could be said about elections that "She with the most money 
wins," because 94% of the legislative candidates who spent the most money won 
in November, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 To increase chances of winning, candidates are lending, not contributing -- a 
la (Ross) Perot and ( L.A. Mayor Richard) Riordan -- substantial sums of money 
to their campaigns. The average debt of an entering assemblyman in 1992 was 
$58,400. 
</P>
<P>
 This trend is evident in many of the current local races. The queen of 
self-financing is Marilyn Brewer, a candidate in the 70th Assembly District. 
She loaned her campaign $180,000 from personal and business accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 A review of the campaign statement filed by Jim Morrissey, Republican 
candidate for the 69th Assembly District, disclosed that he has loaned his 
campaign $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
 It is far less pernicious and infinitely more honest for a candidate to give 
money to their campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is how the newly elected legislator pays him or herself back. They 
do it by raising money after the election by holding special-interest 
fund-raisers. The money raised at these events, usually held in Sacramento, is 
then paid back to the former candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the pay-back of the loans to the campaign so critical to the 
officeholder is that often, the money loaned to the campaign is obtained by the 
then-candidate mortgaging the family home. Who do you think will receive a more 
welcome reception from the new assemblyman -- a special-interest group who just 
contributed $5,000 that went directly into the politician's pocket or Bob 
Voter? 
</P>
<P>
 To some measure there has always been and will always be politics as usual. 
However, by any measure special interests have contributed increasingly large 
amounts of money to candidates over the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The trends of elected legislators strongly influencing primary elections and 
candidates financing their own campaigns with personal debt materially reduce 
the opportunity for effective government. 
</P>
<P>
 Elections and legislation are being hijacked by the few to the detriment of 
the many, which leads to a society of political haves and have-nots.

TIME TO CUT REPUBLICANS DOWN TO SIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * If Republican officeholders are as committed to reducing the size and cost 
of government as party officials would like voters to believe, then why do GOP 
candidates running for elected office in Orange County continue to promise the 
elimination of government waste? 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans have long controlled most city councils in the county -- as of 
1992, more than two-thirds of all local elected officials were 
Republicans.Republicans have also dominated the Board of Supervisors for 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 If Republican officeholders were a guarantee of smaller, less wasteful and 
more efficient government, then the various governmental bodies in Orange 
County would hardly need reforming. 
</P>
<P>
 To hear GOP candidates tell it, however, county and local government is still 
rife with wasteful expenditures and unnecessary programs. 
</P>
<P>
 This makes absolutely no sense. Republicans control most elected positions in 
the county and yet the GOP continues to say it's the party better suited to 
"reduce the size and cost of government." Maybe this argument works when 
applied to the state Legislature or the U.S. Congress, but it shouldn't be 
permitted to wash in Orange County given the overwhelming dominance of 
Republicans in elected offices. 
</P>
<P>
 If there's as much waste in county and local government as the current crop of 
GOP candidates claim, we've no one else to blame but the Republican 
officeholders we've been electing to guard the candy store. 
</P>
<P>
 Either there's not as much waste in local and county government as GOP 
candidates allege or Republicans aren't as committed to its elimination as 
campaign flyers allege. Maybe it's simply time for voters to change the 
guardians.

<TEXT>
<P>
 * It is unfortunate that at this time of scarce financial resources at every 
level of government we are seeing cases of (tuberculosis) up 44% in 1993 
compared to 1991. The cases of TB in the schools reflect what is occurring in 
Orange County as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Solutions aren't just the responsibility of the public health system but for 
all of us as a community to find ways to deal with the crisis.

POLICE PHOTO FILES FOSTER FUZZY ETHICS; DUBIOUS PRACTICE IS RIFE WITH 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A picture is worth a thousand words, but it also can be a very troublesome 
shorthand. 
</P>
<P>
 In their zeal to combat Orange County's gang activities, a number of local 
police departments have been collecting photographs of young people, even 
without evidence or reason to believe that they have been involved in criminal 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Many departments defend the practice as necessary to anticipating gang 
activities and cracking down on crime. Police understandably feel overmatched 
and want to allocate their best resources to anti-gang efforts, especially 
using the investigative tools that will help them work cooperatively with other 
law enforcement agencies. On the face of it, photos seem to fill the bill in 
building reference materials on gangs, and it is somehow more justifiable in 
some law enforcement circles to assume everything is OK if youngsters do not 
specifically object to having their pictures taken. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problems inherent in this approach are evident in the lawsuit filed 
last month by a Tustin High School honor student, Quyen Pham, 16, against the 
Garden Grove Police Department. She is seeking a halt to the practice and the 
return of photographs of herself and two girlfriends taken by police after they 
left a Garden Grove cafe and were waiting for a ride home. 
</P>
<P>
 In instances like this, despite police claims of going over a "mental 
checklist" before taking photos, youngsters who may be guilty of nothing more 
than gathering for a moonlight barbecue have had their pictures taken for the 
dossier. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is complicated by the fact that many departments are only 
beginning to get to know minority communities. Often they lack the very close 
knowledge that would make it possible for them to use photographs wisely 
instead of casting an overly broad net. 
</P>
<P>
 It is one thing to say that only the wrongdoers will be weeded out, but many 
departments are not sufficiently familiar with the minority communities they 
are supposed to serve to really know who is who. The effect can be to undo the 
aims of community policing, which as a national trend in law enforcement is 
designed to put police in closer touch with neighborhoods, not drive a wedge 
between those wearing a badge and those walking the streets. Such photographing 
can aggravate suspicions at precisely the time when efforts are being made to 
improve relationships between police and minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-gang strategies must aim to build more intimate knowledge of 
neighborhoods, not foster alienation, and they must be carried out with the 
cooperation of law-abiding members of all our diverse communities. In instances 
where it may be a police officer's word against that of a young person, many 
youngsters are either too frightened or lacking in sophistication to withhold 
their permission to be photographed. The possibilities for abuse are ever 
present. Photo files make possible the full range of racial stereotyping. 
</P>
<P>
 Photographing at best must have very limited application and be used only when 
affected communities know clearly the rules under which police operate. A 
picture can be more dangerous than a thousand words if it leads to 
over-generalizations, snap judgments and the abridgment of civil liberties of 
young Orange County residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, nobody should be comfortable in a nation where a young woman was 
told by police that she should not bother coming to a particular city if she 
wanted to avoid such problems. Clearly, we cannot have our own children under a 
cloud of suspicion merely for being out and about in a free society.

A CHANCE TO GLIMPSE NATURAL WONDERS; IRVINE CO., NATURE CONSERVANCY PACT GIVES 
PUBLIC OPPORTUNITY TO TOUR PROTECTED AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The opening this weekend of some 6,600 acres of land that stretch from Coast 
Highway inland through Emerald Canyon to the north and from Laguna Canyon Road 
to Crystal Cove State Park was a double dose of good news for nature lovers and 
for those who cherish the preservation of precious open space. 
</P>
<P>
 In making good on a 4-year-old promise, the Irvine Co. has made this rare 
reserve accessible to the public through tours. It was part of a laudable 
agreement signed in 1992 with the Nature Conservancy, a nonprofit conservation 
organization, to preserve and protect natural resources as well as to provide 
public access. The opening of the reserve's Emerald Canyon portion originally 
had been scheduled for last October, but it was postponed because of the 
wildfires that destroyed an estimated 80% of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambitious program began last year with the opening of Limestone Canyon to 
tours, and is expected to be completed this fall with the opening of 2,800 
acres in the Weir/Gypsum Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 It is heartening to learn from advance touring of the Emerald Canyon section 
that nature is on the rebound in the affected areas. Fields of purple wild 
hyacinths, red Indian paintbrushes and yellow California sunflowers have 
appeared in an area that was black and barren only last fall. And there are now 
red-tailed hawks, meadowlarks, bobcats and mule deer. The ability of nature to 
recover, evident in the spring of a new year, has to be a heartening sight 
after the fires in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The vastness of the open space in close proximity to the suburban sprawl of 
Southern California serves as a reminder of the natural beauty of the land 
around us. The Irvine Co. and the Nature Conservancy have done good work 
pioneering in such set-asides, and they have been key players in the state's 
habitat protection program. Such preserves remind us of the need to protect 
natural resources from overdevelopment.

PRAISING PEACE OFFICERS FOR THEIR WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am writing this as a letter of appreciation to the article "Posthumous 
Bronze Stars," (May 19). 
</P>
<P>
 I can't tell you how wonderful it feels to see those slain officers remembered 
and praised for their work. 
</P>
<P>
 My father is a deputy sheriff for the County of Orange. I am very proud of him 
for the work that he does. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard work being a police officer. It is difficult for him, and for my 
family. It must be very hard for him to work his midnight shift (dealing with 
all of the stress) and then come home to be a father and a husband. 
</P>
<P>
 I think that many people overlook or push aside the fact that police officers 
are people, too. They just look at them as the person who hassled them for 
driving too fast or parking in the handicapped space. My father, and the other 
peace officers that work for us, deserve so much more. 
</P>
<P>
 To see that your newspaper took the time to show people that these things are 
happening makes me proud. Many times the death of a peace officer is shoved to 
the back page. 
</P>
<P>
 I think that many people would be surprised to know that only 36 law 
enforcement officers in the County of Orange have been killed in the line of 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
 I am just thankful that my father is not one of those statistics, and 
hopefully never will be. He is a good cop, and I am proud of him and all of the 
other peace officers who serve us.

SUPERVISORIAL HOPEFULS' VOTING RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Voters should be aware of the voting record of supervisorial candidates Jim 
Silva and Linda Moulton Patterson. As members of the Huntington Beach City 
Council, both of them have voted to approve contracts with city employees that 
allowed pension spiking. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year they have voted, as part of the budget process, to levy a special 
property tax of over $6 million on the residents of Huntington Beach to pay for 
city employees' retirement contributions.  
</P>
<P>
 So much for Silva's claim to be anti-tax!  
</P>
<P>
 I wonder why the Orange County sheriff's officers endorsed Moulton Patterson. 
Could they be looking for a supervisor that will allow them a feeding frenzy at 
the public trough?

AIRPORT-USE PETITION FOR EL TORO MARINE BASE DRAWS OPPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In "Letting the Public Join El Toro Debate," (Letters, May 22), I feel sorry 
that Buck Johns and George Argyros are hurting their reputations as smart 
businessmen on an impossible situation. 
</P>
<P>
 First, they decry and put down your Times editorial of May 8 and declare they 
have faith in the public's intelligence by pushing for the initiative on El 
Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not so, since reports from all over the county are that their people 
are approaching voters to sign their petitions by saying, "Sign this for 21,000 
jobs or you'll have a prison there." 
</P>
<P>
 This, even though El Toro will not lend itself to become a seventh regional or 
international airport because of serious physical restrictions. Also, some of 
the other airports are starting to report less passenger use. Your editorial 
was "right on the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Their letter proves that Johns and Argyros are masters of double talk but 
"they still don't get it." 
</P>
<P>

 * Re the letter from George Argyros and William Buck Johns: 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the current controversy concerning the planning for the closure of 
the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, I find myself appalled by their concept 
that the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority (ETRPA) is "parochial." 
</P>
<P>
 As I understand it, ETRPA is studying the problem from three different 
perspectives, including the possible use as a commercial airport. It is a large 
parcel of land and could accommodate a number of different uses. 
</P>
<P>
 The petition Argyros and friends are circulating proposes a single-issue 
concept that the base should be a commercial airport and, if the petition is 
successful and passed, will preclude consideration of any other possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge for yourself who has the "narrow perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 JUDITH ODLUM 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * The recent letter from the two allied, well-intentioned (?) and benevolent 
Newport Beach financial gurus, George Argyros and William Buck Johns, poses 
some interesting contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, they are touting the unrestricted use of the El Toro base as 
a commercial airport, including 24-hour freight flights and demeaning the 
concerns of the boundary residents as parochial and myopic.  
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, they, I am sure, were active or sympathetic participants in 
imposing severe flight restrictions on John Wayne flights as they approach 
Newport Beach, grandfathered without the benefit of the public discussion 
petitions from all of Orange County that they are now pushing for. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe we should have a countywide petition for the Newport Beach area 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 We have a well-represented planning group, the El Toro Reuse Planning 
Authority, established to find out the best use for the base with much more 
creditability than either of these two gentlemen. Let's let (the planning 
authority) do its job without some flack from these coercing and strong-arm 
dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
 With the energy they have demonstrated, I suggest that they attack and spend 
their money for our surface rapid transit problems.  
</P>
<P>
 To you well-intentioned and thoughtful Orange County residents, do not be 
misled by this evil and destructive petition and movement.

PROPOSITION 1C: THE INVESTMENT AND ITS COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The time has come for Orange County to extend the forward thinking it has 
demonstrated in the development of organizations like Partnership 2010 and the 
Orange County Development Consortium to its colleges and universities. We may 
be able to keep a business from leaving Orange County, but if there are no 
skilled employees to work at that company, we have not succeeded in 
strengthening the county's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 1C, the Higher Education Facilities Bond Act, is a step toward 
proactively maintaining the superior quality of Orange County's colleges and 
universities. By voting for the proposition, we vote in favor of training a 
skilled job force for Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 As president and CEO of Independence One Bank, I understand the value of 
skilled and intelligent employees. I also understand what it takes to create 
these individuals. They need to graduate from a dynamic higher education 
system. With its universities and community colleges, Orange County currently 
has such a system, and cannot afford to lose it. Proposition 1C will help 
ensure that we do not lose our edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporting public education is a sound investment in the future, because it is 
an investment in a quality job force. I urge you to vote yes on Proposition 1C. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) and other proponents of Proposition 
1C (Letters, May 29) have ignored the vital issue in their haste to champion 
this bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is not if the money has noble purposes (arguable) or if it will be 
prudently used (does the state have a good record of this?), but rather, it is 
whether the state ought to take out another loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, bonds are loans, and must be repaid, with interest . Why don't voters 
realize this? 
</P>
<P>
 Do we want to mortgage our futures further? The total cost to taxpayers will 
be more than twice what is authorized by Prop 1C. Do we want to pay double for 
something we may not even need? And, if the purposes for the bond funds are so 
vital, why has not money been wisely set aside in the past? Further, what is 
our guarantee that another 'crisis' like this won't occur again next year, and 
the year after, and . . .?

A 'CLIQUE' THAT IS RICH IN DIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am a student at Canyon High School in Canyon Country. I read "RACE: Rise 
in Ethnic Tensions Seen at School" (May 14) and I would like to comment on the 
article. 
</P>
<P>
 "Outside the classroom, they say students fall into clearly defined cliques of 
blacks, whites and Latinos. While not entirely exclusive, the blacks hang out 
near a big tree on campus and the Latinos near the entrance to the library -- 
leaving the rest of the school to the whites." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, your reporter did not look across the quad to the steps of the 
multipurpose room to see the "clique" I'm in. My "clique" is not all white, 
black or Latino. It is a mix. There is a large group of us and we are friends, 
we help each other when we need help, and we talk to each other when we need to 
talk. There are whites, of which I am one, blacks, Latinos, Asians and American 
Indians. Two of these groups your article didn't even mention. The "clique" I'm 
a part of is one of the many groups that do not follow the standards you 
printed.

MONEY DOESN'T MAKE A CANDIDATE QUALIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I would like politely to take issue with a few of the points in your May 14 
story on my status as the lead Republican candidate in the 24th Congressional 
District ("Sybert War Chest Filled With His Own Cash"). 
</P>
<P>
 It is not money that I am using to "overwhelm" my political opponents, as the 
article suggests.All the money in the world won't help you if you're not right 
on the issues and square with the voters. If I am winning, it is because I am 
the best-qualified candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to your article, my fund-raising has not been "modest," despite the 
fact that I have deliberately held off because of our earthquake woes. 
Nevertheless, I have raised -- outside of my own funds -- three times as much 
as my closest competitor, and 12 times as much as the liberal incumbent, 
Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, I cannot leave unchallenged the misleading statement in the article 
by one of my primary opponents that he will counter my support with "his many 
years residing in the district and activism in Republican circles." The 
gentleman moved here in 1985 from Kansas and then failed to vote or even 
register in almost every election until 1992, not what I would call much in the 
way of either residency or activism. By contrast, I was born here.

IN DEFENSE OF A CATHOLIC EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re: "High School Bride Battles Archdiocese," May 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Caesar, this is not the "Dark Ages," as you lamented in the Los Angeles Times 
article May 27, and yet each day, as a "practicing Catholic" I feel I must 
defend my faith in this la-la land that we live in. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the real world of Catholicism. It is called "facing the issue." . . 
. And the issue here is learning about your Catholic religion and living your 
Catholic religion. 
</P>
<P>
 My husband and I sacrificed time and money to educate our children in the 
Catholic tradition. That is what education at Alemeny (High School) is -- 
Catholic tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, you and your wife do not choose to be educated in the Catholic 
tradition. If your wife wants education, she can be educated at one of the 
excellent Los Angeles Unified School District's high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Our children have learned that when they make a choice, it is their decision 
and they live by that option. As a graduate of Alemeny, haven't you learned 
that too? I guess not.

THEIR SPECIALTY IS OVERSIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Gruhkle might have briefly thought that he was in a real-life episode of 
"The X Files" as he sat in a desolate Santa Clarita field Monday night. But the 
blinding light that descended upon his stuck pickup truck was all too 
terrestrial in origin.It was a helicopter with a ticket-writing sheriff's 
deputy who handed him a misdemeanor citation for trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that they have nothing better to do than harass young people, 
when there's (more serious crimes) going on in other parts," Gruhkle groused. 
</P>
<P>
 We beg to differ. Part of the deputy's responsibility is to watch out for 
brush fires in remote areas of the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys and for 
those who might deliberately set them. 
</P>
<P>
 Other aerial patrols are taking place over the Angeles National Forest, 
involving perhaps the most aerodynamic of neighborhood watch groups: the Sylmar 
Hang Gliding Assn.'s arson and crime watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day, one or more of the group's 200 members are out, soaring for hours 
over areas near Kagel Mountain. They're on the lookout for fires and -- more 
dubiously -- suspicious folks. Members of the Tujunga ranger district have 
credited the group with being good informants, and they are said to have helped 
prevent some fires from turning into larger ones by spotting them quickly and 
notifying authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps now that little walk around the block on behalf of your neighborhood 
watch group won't seem like burden.

HONORING THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST; HIGH SCHOOL VALEDICTORIANS ARE EVIDENCE OF 
MELTING POT'S BOUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 June is when we honor those who have climbed to the top of the academic ladder 
to become valedictorians at their respective high schools. Here in the San 
Fernando Valley, it's also a moment worthy of reflection. Many of the families 
and children so represented hail not only from America but from all corners of 
the globe. These are examples of the Valley as the city's new melting pot, and 
what's simmering looks pretty darned good to us. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the valedictorians profiled in the Times Valley Edition this past 
week stand as reassuring examples of the kind of gritty determination that 
helps distinguish this nation. That's something too often forgotten in the 
midst of all the current immigrant bashing. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these students, like Thatcher Friese of Verdugo Hills High School, are 
headed off to some of the nation's finest public and private colleges and 
universities. Friese, who with his ever-present chess set looks like something 
out of a Norman Rockwell painting, is going to Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of those who have been accepted at the most competitive campuses, 
it's also important to remember that not all come from highly regarded and 
well-funded public schools such as those in the Las Virgenes Unified School 
District. Some are also the finest representatives of an oft-maligned school 
system, the Los Angeles Unified School District, which must somehow find a way 
to inspire other students to pursue a similar excellence. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the valedictorians, such as Korean-born Yoo-Jean Chi of Monroe High, 
and Ethiopian-born Bezuayhu Arega of Sylmar High, knew little if any English 
when they arrived here. In two years, Bezuayhu was taking honors English 
courses. Yoo-Jean has her eyes set on Yale Law School and a seat on the U.S. 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Others can be held up as examples because of the extreme hardships they had to 
overcome. The family of Mexican-born Sandra Ruiz arrived here with little more 
than a few suitcases; she lived where there was no quiet place in which she 
could study. Cindy Phan, who is just 16 and one of Kennedy High School's 
valedictorians, arrived here as a Vietnamese boat person. She will be attending 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most of them will return to Los Angeles after graduating from college. 
Perhaps those who will be attending local universities will choose to remain 
here. We should be so lucky.

CHANGE OF ADDRESS BAFFLES RESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Recently, the neighborhood in which I live was victimized by yet another 
example of inconsiderate and calloused government bureaucracy. This one arrived 
in the mail box.After 31 years at the same address in Canoga Park, the U.S. 
Postal service has unilaterally decided and subsequently informed me though an 
"Official Notice" that I now live in Winnetka. The street name is the same. The 
number is the same. The house looks like it is still where I left it the day 
before. However, suddenly, I've moved! The Postal Service is trying to 
accomplish that which even the earthquakes, floods and fires have failed to do. 
</P>
<P>
 I know many people have taken "to the hills" (West) to shed their Canoga Park 
address. I happen to like Canoga Park. "Canoga" rolls of the tongue very 
poetically. "Park" conjures up a vision of trees, flowers, tranquillity. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, "Winnetka" evokes a vision of a windy, cold Chicago suburb and in 
pronouncing the name, the "t" and the "k" stick in my throat. For at least 31 
years, Winnetka has been a sign on Winnetka Avenue near Vanowen Street and the, 
now-defunct Big Noise (on Winnetka) tavern. I am not trying to pick a fight 
with those who live in Winnetka, California or Illinois. However, there are 
folks in Winnetka (the California one) trying to "take to the hills" (Woodland) 
themselves. Why not try to mend that leak instead and leave me alone? 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service also appended four numerals to my ZIP code. I will gladly 
add that to my ZIP code if it makes mail processing and delivery more 
efficient. I do not see how changing the name of a patch of turf in Los Angeles 
contributes to that effort! 
</P>
<P>
 Sign my name "I ain't moving"!

GANGS' PUSH FOR PEACE OFFERS LIFE LESSONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Thank you for publishing the good news inherent in "Gangs Make Sweeping 
Change" (May 19). The last line in the story is a quote from a neighbor who no 
longer feels terrorized, " 'Now the boys see me walking and they say 'hello' to 
me. . . . This is a good example for the rest of the gangs.'" 
</P>
<P>
 It is a great example for the rest of the gangs and for all of us. The Times 
Valley Edition would be doing all of its readers a favor if it followed the 
stories of these courageous youths who have decided to adopt a kinder, more 
compassionate lifestyle. Their brave decision to live peacefully while helping 
heal their community is front page news, and we would all benefit from learning 
of it everyday.

THINGS TO CONSIDER BEFORE CHANGING L.A. RIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * This is to comment on plans being proposed by environmental and recreational 
interests to convert the existing concrete-lined channels of the Los Angeles 
River and some of its tributaries to soft-bottom, green-belt streams. The 
following is intended to give some perspective on the magnitude of structural 
and hydraulic problems that must be considered in all plans to control or to 
live with the Los Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
 The elevation of the Los Angeles River at Sepulveda Dam is 700 feet above mean 
sea level (about 50 river miles upstream from Long Beach). The elevation of 
Lake Erie is about 570 feet where it empties into the Niagara River, which then 
flows over a vertical drop of about 160 feet at Niagara Falls in its way to 
Lake Ontario. To keep the velocity of the Los Angeles River slow enough to 
prevent erosion of a soft-bottom channel, "drop structures" totaling four times 
the height of Niagara Falls would need to be built between Sepulveda Dam and 
Long Beach. Also, flood flows in the Los Angeles River can exceed 200,000 cubic 
feet per second, which is much greater than normal flow over Niagara Falls. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction many years ago of concrete channels to control high-velocity 
floods in Los Angeles County should not be lamented. The alternatives then were 
either to construct flood-control improvements, which were economically 
justified, or to relocate people who were living in flood plains and were in 
constant danger. The latter was not politically feasible. Removal of existing 
concrete channels would require acquisition of thousands of acres of developed 
flood plain areas adjacent to the river and would now cost taxpayers billions 
of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 At this time, it is obvious that, for safety and practical reasons, the hazard 
from high velocity floods should still be the primary criterion used in 
developing all plans to modify or improve the existing channels of the Los 
Angeles River and its tributaries. On the bright side -- with proper planning 
and design -- much land adjacent to the concrete channels can still be used for 
recreation, rapid transit and/or open space, as long as access is provided to 
maintain the essential flood-control structures.

BEILENSON'S MAILINGS ARE LEGITIMATE BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In his article "Beilenson Is Among House's Top Spenders On Mailings" (May 
2), Alan C. Miller states that Congressman Anthony C. Beilenson's spending of 
$166,439 on his publicly funded mail last year has raised questions about 
whether mail is being used to bolster his political prospects. As one of his 
constituents who had received this mail before Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) was 
placed in a more competitive district, I disagree with this implication.His 
letters have always been either informational or in the form of questionnaires 
on important issues, which he uses to help guide him in making decisions. 
Furthermore, we have always been informed about the results of the 
questionnaires. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller mentions that Beilenson has informed his constituents of his support 
for the Clinton health care reform plan. In this respect, it is important to 
note that Beilenson is one of the 95 co-sponsors of the McDermott single-payer 
plan, which is the kind of health system called for in the California health 
Security Act Initiative petition signed by over 1 million California voters. 
</P>
<P>
 In my opinion, Beilenson is one of the few politicians in our nation's Capitol 
with integrity.

TIMES OF TROUBLE ARE WHEN VOLUNTEERS ARE NEEDED MOST; QUAKE HAS SIDETRACKED 
VALLEY EFFORTS, BUT SOME RESIDENTS STILL INSPIRE US 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first-year student at a San Fernando Valley high school wasn't very happy. 
Her hard-working single mother was holding down full-time and part-time jobs to 
make ends meet, and did not have as much free time as the daughter would have 
liked. It was a tossup in terms of whether her father was worse at keeping up 
on support payments or at just keeping in touch. He seemed to be pretty lousy 
at both. And there wasn't much spare cash for the kinds of material possessions 
that the daughter would have wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 So, it was hardly with high hopes that the daughter begrudgingly began some 
volunteer work at the suggestion of a wise neighborhood friend. In those 
activities, she came across families made homeless because of the Northridge 
quake, she came across orphans and foster kids who barely knew their parents or 
had never known them. And she came home with a greater appreciation for what 
she had in life, for how hard her mother was working on her behalf, and for how 
hard her oft-unemployed father was trying to help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt a little silly about having been so grumpy and down all the time," 
said the daughter of a mother who lives in a crime-ridden neighborhood and does 
not want to be publicly identified as a single female parent. "Things could be 
a whole lot worse for us." 
</P>
<P>
 That is one of the unintended side effects of volunteerism. We're referring to 
the fact that giving one's time and effort to another in need can be as 
beneficial to the giver as it is to the one who gratefully receives it. This is 
an issue now because of an alarming decline in the San Fernando Valley among 
those who would have otherwise volunteered for worthy causes. 
</P>
<P>
 The following numbers tell the story best: adult volunteers for Girl Scouts in 
the Central and West valleys, down 75%; inquiries for Big Sisters of Los 
Angeles, down 13%, and for Big Brothers, down by one-third; new recruits to the 
Volunteer Center of Los Angeles, down 20% to 25%; car-owning volunteers for 
Meals on Wheels, down 35% to 40%. "The numbers of volunteers are dropping off 
at a time when the needs are high," United Way senior planner Sally Hoover told 
Times reporter Abigail Goldman. Officials told her they attribute the declines 
to disruption from the quake and the efforts to recover from its effects. 
</P>
<P>
 But for every such story, there are others that may offer some inspiration for 
the rest of us. One came from Times reporter Jocelyn Stewart's account of the 
hard life of 101-year-old Mercury Adams of Pacoima. She has endured racism, 
segregation and poverty as well as the recent natural disasters. She still 
finds time to pray for and counsel neighbors who are in need of spiritual 
relief. Her cupboards are still open to those who do not have enough to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Rieder is an Auschwitz survivor who lost all but one relative in the 
Holocaust. Those who will honor her today for her community service describe 
her as a woman without bitterness who serves as a model for children and as a 
mentor for teachers in her role with the Burbank Temple Emanu El Nursery 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the employees of the Home Depot store in Canoga Park suffered damage 
to their own homes in the quake. They still found the time and the energy to 
help repair a stranger's quake-damaged home in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 At Valley schools after the quake, parent volunteers helped notify their peers 
of school closings and reopenings and meetings. They helped clean debris from 
damaged campuses and helped soothe each other's and their children's jangled 
nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, they were able to briefly set aside their own problems, fears 
and concerns. And like that high school student we mentioned, they might have 
come across people facing much tougher times. We're not talking about finding 
solace in the greater misfortunes of others. We are talking about looking 
beyond your own situation toward the greater good of the community of which you 
are a necessary part. The need for volunteers is great. Are you sure that you 
cannot help?

LANDLORDS UNFAIRLY BEAR THE BURDEN OF DISASTER; CALIFORNIA LAW HOLDS OWNERS OF 
APARTMENT BUILDINGS LIABLE FOR LOSS IN CATASTROPHES LIKE THE JAN. 17 QUAKE. AN 
ATTORNEY ARGUES THAT THIS THREATENS THE BLAMELESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLEN THARPE, Allen Tharpe is the managing partner of Tharpe & Howell, a Los 
Angeles-based law firm. His clients include the current owner of the Northridge 
Meadows apartments, where 16 people died in the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California authorities are rightly seeking to assess blame for the devastation 
that killed and injured so many of our neighbors in the Northridge earthquake 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are trying to learn why purportedly reinforced freeways 
collapsed and why building inspectors are finding a pattern of faulty 
construction and design in destroyed and damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 In this period of reassessment of earthquake-related building policies, 
however, nothing is being said about a quirk in California law that literally 
allows the courts to blame the blameless -- owners of apartment buildings -- 
for the injuries and deaths caused by quake-damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Apartment house owners may seem unlikely candidates for our compassion, but 
the reality is that California law requires that they shoulder the liability 
for design or construction defects that cause their buildings to fail and 
injure or kill people inside -- even when they bought the buildings long after 
they were built and had nothing to do with their design or construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of a single-family rental house that falls down and kills everyone 
inside faces no such strict liability. Neither does the owner of the strip mall 
that caves in and kills dozens, or the owner of a hospital that collapses and 
kills hundreds. Such owners who had nothing to do with the structure's design 
or construction will not be held strictly liable for the injuries or deaths 
even if it is determined that a construction or design defect contributed to 
the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 But if any apartment building gives way, its present owner is liable for any 
injury or damage that results from a defect, even if he or she had nothing to 
do with its design or construction and was in fact the fourth, fifth or 10th 
owner of the building. The owner can attempt to recover all or part of the 
damages from those actually at fault, such as the architect and builder -- if 
they are still alive, are solvent and can be located. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, when an injury occurs, the U.S. judicial system holds responsible 
the person who caused the harm. This is liability based on fault. However, in 
products liability cases, the courts have carved out an exception whereby every 
person ever connected with the design, manufacture or sale of a product is held 
liable for any injury proved to be caused by the product's failure to perform 
as expected. This is known as strict liability. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, in Becker vs. IRM Corp., the California Supreme Court expanded the 
scope of strict liability to apply to the owners of apartment buildings. The 
Becker case means that even the 100th buyer of a building could be held liable 
for problems he never knew existed and could not have discovered even through 
reasonable inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 The rationale behind Becker is that landlords are in the best position to bear 
the cost of injuries and can obtain insurance to protect themselves. 
Unfortunately, this reasoning does not acknowledge that insurance is expensive, 
that obtaining insurance to cover all eventualities is impossible and that 
rents are controlled by both the marketplace and rent control laws. 
</P>
<P>
 As the attorney representing numerous owners of apartment buildings damaged in 
the Northridge quake, I am witnessing the impact of this travesty firsthand. 
Some of my clients are large developers. But others are retired couples who 
planned their retirement around the income of a small apartment house. They 
owned the buildings but had nothing to do with their design or construction. 
Yet they face years of litigation, huge damage claims and in some cases 
financial ruin -- all for alleged activities for which they are unquestionably 
blameless. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine the implications of such a law in the aftermath of the catastrophic 
earthquake that so many experts predict for our state. Not only would we face 
unparalleled injury, death and destruction, but with that kind of liability, we 
would also face a future in which destroyed apartment buildings would simply 
never be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 California is in the minority of states that impose strict liability on 
apartment owners. As the implications of this legal doctrine become clear as a 
result of this earthquake, we can expect the number of investors willing to 
risk everything to own apartment buildings to shrink, which in turn will reduce 
an inadequate pool of affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 During this period of rebuilding and reaffirming California's commitment to a 
healthy social and business environment, the public, Legislature and courts 
should re-examine the wisdom of singling out apartment owners as the one group 
of real estate owners somehow suited to be blamed when they are blameless.

STRIKE WHILE THE IRONING'S STILL HOT; FOR MOMS, WORKING CONDITIONS, SALARY AND 
PROSPECTS FOR ADVANCEMENT CAN BE DISMAL, DESPITE PROGRESS. DON'T BE AFRAID TO 
PLAY HARDBALL WITH MANAGEMENT.

<P>
 There was the Homestead Strike of 1892. Federal troops were sent in and 18 
people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the Haymarket Riot of 1886. Eleven men died in the protest against 
deplorable working conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there were My Mother's Strikes of 1954, 1955, 1956 and 1957. Mom marched 
up to her bedroom and stayed in bed for three days. We had to fend for 
ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm on strike!" she'd yell whenever we were hungry or needed our band 
uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you striking for?" we'd have asked if we'd any idea what a strike 
was. 
</P>
<P>
 "A decent 12-hour working day. The right to take a shower without worrying 
about the scum between the tiles." 
</P>
<P>
 In the pre-feminist Dark Ages, such strikes were probably common. Friends of 
mine keep coming up with childhood memories of Mom in the bedroom "on strike." 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother would go upstairs and close her bedroom door and just refuse to 
come out," a friend told me over coffee the other day. "My dad would go in 
there, and there'd be yelling. It scared me. I'd go back and forth between 
them, trying to make peace." 
</P>
<P>
 This friend and I brought our stories to a women's dinner and found 
compatriots: "Me too! My mother used to declare strikes after all the 
holidays!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These protests my friends and I witnessed weren't really strikes at all but 
small nervous breakdowns. And why not? Look at our mothers' working conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Their job performance was constantly under review by people with a 
grade-school education or less. 
</P>
<P>
 They could be critiquing the Second Law of Thermodynamics and have to break 
off to fetch a roll of toilet paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Their "salaries" evaporated whenever kids needed expensive new sports 
equipment or cool new outfits. 
</P>
<P>
 They were plain overworked, slaving over meals and housework. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days up in her bedroom? What our mothers needed was a month in the 
country, a testimonial dinner and a trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the three days were up, it was back to the same old grind. It would 
be nearly two decades after our Mothers Strikes of the 1950s before women would 
make housework a political issue. In the General Strike of 1972, women got 
plain about it: "We hate housework!" "Out of the kitchens and into the 
boardrooms!" 
</P>
<P>
 Here we are 20 years later. Women are putting in full workdays (and not in the 
boardrooms), and studies show working mothers doing 90% of the housework. But 
now they do it at night and on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother's strikes were futile in terms of winning a shorter, gentler 
workday. But some mothers went on strike and made real gains against 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember when Aunt Pearl disappeared. After stranding Uncle Bob with the 
kids for three days (a casual survey indicates three days as the standard 
duration of a mother's strike), she called from a hotel in Connecticut, where 
she read off a list of demands. They were met. 
</P>
<P>
 Most women don't have Aunt Pearl's chutzpah. Self-effacing moms tend not to be 
hardball bargainers. As guardian of the household budget they identify too 
strongly with management: "Three nights at a fancy hotel? When Tracy needs 
Rollerblades and Matt's dying for a Sega CD player?" 
</P>
<P>
 Women need to practice preserving a stronghold of ego against the pull of 
domestic and custodial responsibility. My husband remembers his mother locking 
herself in the bathroom to study her textbooks when, in her forties, she 
decided to become a teacher. Her kids kept demanding band uniforms and snacks. 
She kept studying. They yelled louder. She kept studying. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She finally passed her exams, got her teaching certificate and hired somebody 
else to iron the uniforms and make the snacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that we've admitted the General Strike of 1972 was a washout, it's time to 
get real. Individual mother's strikes are in again. So let's learn from the 
examples set two generations ago: 
</P>
<P>
 1. When striking, always go to a hotel. Beds are for sick people. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Have a plan. Make a list of demands. Going into a three-day snit doesn't 
get you anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Don't fight with your husband. That just traumatizes the next generation of 
strikers. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Forget perfectionism. Wrinkled band uniforms are a small price to pay for a 
decent life. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, remember those who struck before you. Be strong! Someday one of us 
will reach the mountaintop, look down the other side, and tell us how women 
juggle it all in the Promised Land.

A NATURAL FOR 'FAKE LAKES'; ALGAE-REMOVAL EXPERT CREATES HABITAT-SAFE WATER 
WITHOUT TOXINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Living in Southern California, surrounded by commercial and residential 
development, Shelly Solomon has carved a niche as a passionate environmentalist 
in what some might call an odd way. 
</P>
<P>
 She works for developers -- many of whom can't wait to hire her. Solomon, 37, 
cleans up their lakes for a living. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of her projects involve "fake lakes," as she calls them, created by 
developers as showy centerpieces to condominium projects or industrial parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, Solomon is called to rescue these lakes at the eleventh hour. Having 
used chlorine, copper and other toxic elements to rid their artificial lakes of 
algae, most of her clients have managed only to compound the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Solomon and her partner, David Cowling, run the Irvine-based Ecoquatics, which 
uses a wide variety of plant life to soak up and suck up algae and chemicals. 
The results are natural ecosystems for birds and fish and "crystal-clear water 
-- naturally," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Solomon also runs another company out of the same office, Land & Sea Landscape 
Architects, which is similarly unconventional. For those clients, she makes 
open spaces or even residential back yards animal-friendly habitats. 
</P>
<P>
 In that line, she worked as part of a scientific team helping to create 
wilderness areas in conjunction with William R. Mason Regional Park in Irvine, 
the Tustin Ranch and even the expansion of Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian 
in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But her greatest love, Solomon said, is cleaning up lakes.  
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't a one-time operation," she said. "Much of the work is maintaining 
the plant life we put in, which is pretty extensive. We do that once a week, 
with any lake we clean up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pouring chemicals in a lake is easy -- it's a quick fix, a short-term 
solution that poses a long-term problem. Taking care of a lake chemically free 
is a lot more time-consuming, but the lake will live forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Solomon said her work has made her an even more ardent environmentalist. 
Developers, she said, are doing immeasurable damage by paving over pristine 
ecosystems with one more strip mall or yet another stucco-walled, tile-roofed 
subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy is that "our native wetlands are being destroyed, because we keep 
on building right on top of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Larger lakes are even more critical, but by restoring the smaller so-called 
"fake lakes" that permeate residential and commercial developments, 
particularly in Southern California, Solomon says she can "give back a bit of 
life" to mallards and other migratory birds that have been in jeopardy for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Berry, a conservationist with the local chapter of the Audubon Society, 
said the work that Solomon and others like her across the country are doing is 
the cusp of a trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope the value of her work is self-evident," he said. "We've had 
heaps of habitat loss because of development. But a lot of developers are 
coming around to the realization that it's the long-term goals we have to care 
about. For that matter, people who buy property nowadays are more interested in 
the long-term anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Berry said Solomon's greatest contribution is in sustaining the lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more American ducks are staying in this general area and breeding, 
and they depend on these mini-habitats, which are of no use to them if they're 
polluted with chemicals," Berry said.  
</P>
<P>
 Solomon said she has been shocked by some of what she has seen the last few 
years. Some lakes have become so choked with chemicals that the algae has 
become largely resistant to toxins in general. 
</P>
<P>
 She says the typical response at lakes is to pour two and three times the 
amount of chemicals normally used "and just try to smother the algae that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Developers increasingly are interested in the kind of work she does, but, she 
says, not always for altruistic reasons. Primarily, she says, they're 
struggling to comply with the ever-more stringent state and federal guidelines 
for clean water. 
</P>
<P>
 And developers are finding that keeping land and lakes chemically free has a 
side effect that they especially can't resist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cost," she said. "Why pay the cost of adding chemicals to a lake when you can 
keep the lake chemically free forever? It's a win-win situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Solomon currently is working with a San Dimas contractor on a project 
involving her other forte: restoring natural habitats. 
</P>
<P>
 Just south of the San Gabriel Mountains, Solomon is helping to take "barren 
land strips that have been disturbed by man through construction processes or 
other means and bring them back to the way they were before man intervened," 
said Kevin Quanstrom, vice president of L. Barrios & Associates.  
</P>
<P>
 Solomon is planting non-ornamental plants such as coastal sage, black sage, 
white sage and toyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Quanstrom said, wildlife "seem to be suddenly reappearing."

THINK TANK AT NIXON LIBRARY GETS $1 MILLION; DONATION: GIFT FROM AGRIBUSINESS 
MAGNATE DWAYNE O. ANDREAS WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE CENTER FOR PEACE AND 
FREEDOM IN YORBA LINDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Agribusiness magnate Dwayne O. Andreas, known for his major financial support 
of both Republican and Democratic politicians through the decades, has made a 
$1-million gift to the Center for Peace and Freedom at the Richard Nixon 
Library & Birthplace, a significant boost for the fledgling think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 "During a remarkable two decades as an elder statesman -- through his 
writings, his fact-finding trips, and his public statements -- President Nixon 
demonstrated a profound commitment to finding pragmatic solutions to 
international problems," Andreas, chairman of the board and chief executive of 
Archer Daniels Midland Co., said in a statement issued from his Decatur, Ill., 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Andreas, 76, added that he and his wife, Inez, are "pleased to have this 
opportunity to help perpetuate his matchless legacy." 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the gift, George L. Argyros, chairman of the Nixon library's 
$25-million "Legacy of Peace" fund-raising campaign, said: "As we redouble our 
commitment to sustaining the legacy and, now, the memory of President Nixon, we 
accept Dwayne Andreas' generous gift with enormous gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "His leadership support has dramatically energized our campaign to establish 
the Center for Peace and Freedom, which in turn will have a dramatic impact on 
future generations by helping guide our leaders through the complexities of 
foreign and domestic policy," he said. "We are proud that our campaign has been 
joined by one of America's premier citizen-statesmen -- one who, like President 
Nixon did, thinks in global strategic terms." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1918 in Worthington, Minn., Andreas joined Archer Daniels Midland in 
1966, taking the helm in 1970. Among many other associations, he has served on 
federal advisory bodies under both Republican and Democratic Presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 He is perhaps best known outside agribusiness circles as having contributed 
hundreds of thousands of dollars to the campaign coffers of politicians from 
both parties, a role that has sometimes landed him in controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, he was indicted, but then acquitted, on charges of funneling illegal 
corporate contributions to his good friend, former vice president and 
Democratic presidential candidate, Hubert H. Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
 A $25,000 campaign contribution in 1972 to Nixon fund-raiser Kenneth H. 
Dahlberg turned him into what he once described to the Washington Post as an 
"innocent bystander" in the Watergate scandal. That money ended up in the bank 
account of Watergate burglar Bernard L. Barker, giving investigators the first 
link between the Watergate break-in and the Nixon campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
 His $1-million gift will provide support for the Center for Peace and Freedom, 
which officials say will add a voice to the debate over contemporary political 
issues and preserve Nixon's place in history as a key player in shaping world 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will be headquartered at the Nixon library and also have an office 
in Washington. It began operations in March when former President Nixon spoke 
in the nation's capital before 45 key foreign policy officials, analysts and 
commentators at the inaugural meeting of the center's Study Group on National 
Security, chaired by former Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger. 
</P>
<P>
 That speech was the 37th President's last before his death in April. 
</P>
<P>
 A second study group session, also chaired by Schlesinger, will be held later 
this month in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Legacy of Peace" campaign was launched without fanfare in mid-1993. It 
was announced in January by Argyros -- chairman and chief executive officer of 
Arnel & Affiliates in Costa Mesa -- in Yorba Linda during ceremonies honoring 
former President Nixon on the 25th anniversary of his first inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
 Andreas' gift brings the total raised to $14.5 million, or nearly 60% of the 
campaign's goal, according to the center. (The campaign is spearheaded by a 
$5-million Challenge Grant from philanthropist Walter H. Annenberg's Annenberg 
Foundation.)  
</P>
<P>
 "Dwayne Andreas is a longtime friend of the Nixon family and was both a 
political supporter of President Nixon and a supporter of his work as an elder 
statesman," John H. Taylor, library director, said in a statement. "Among many 
other things, he accompanied President Nixon to Russia in 1992 for a dramatic 
meeting with Boris Yeltsin only a few months after the fall of communism. 
</P>
<P>
 "His support of the center will ensure that the same principles of extending 
peace and freedom Mr. Nixon applied as a former President will continue to be 
applied in the century to come to the problems and opportunities we will face 
as a nation."

CON ARTISTS CASH IN ON SCAMS THAT TARGET SENIORS; CRIME: POLICE WARN ABOUT A 
SCHEME IN WHICH THE THIEF PERSUADES THE VICTIM TO MAKE WITHDRAWALS UNDER THE 
GUISE OF CATCHING A SHIFTY BANK EMPLOYEE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 75-year-old San Clemente woman thought she was helping to catch a thief 
when she withdrew $5,400 from her bank account in January. 
</P>
<P>
 But moments after she nervously drove to the parking lot of a local library 
and handed over an envelope filled with crisp $100 bills to a "bank detective," 
she realized she had been swindled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started screaming and yelling after I sat there for five minutes waiting 
for this man to mark the bills and come back," said the woman, who reported the 
incident to police but said she still can't bring herself to tell any of her 
friends or relatives about it. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who asked that her identity not be revealed, unwittingly fell prey 
to what is known as "the bank examiner scheme," said Sheriff's Sgt. Stan 
Kinkade, who has been tracking the crime for the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of all the financial schemes that are played against the elderly, the bank 
examiner scheme seems to be the one that is the most widely spread locally," 
Kinkade said. "The crook is playing on an elderly person's desire to do what is 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior citizens are often prime targets for this scheme and other types of 
financial fraud, including investment schemes, phony religious or charitable 
donations, fake travel bargains, bogus miracle cures and home inspection 
rip-offs, police and bank officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The elderly make good targets because they are more likely to be isolated from 
family and friends, have poorer eyesight that can sometimes make it difficult 
for them to describe the suspects and often have considerable savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although statistics are difficult to keep because the crime goes unreported 
much of the time, Kinkade said that at least 65 people have reported falling 
victim to the bank examiner scam in Orange County within the past three years. 
No one has been arrested in connection with any of the crimes, Kinkade said. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of money lost is typically between $2,000 and $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The scheme usually works like this: A con artist, posing as a law enforcement 
official, a bank security officer or a bank examiner, asks the victim to help 
catch an untrustworthy bank employee by withdrawing substantial funds. The 
victim is instructed not to tell anyone at the bank why the money is being 
withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 When the money is handed over to the bogus official to be marked as bait for 
the supposed embezzler, the con artist issues a receipt, says the money will be 
redeposited, then disappears. 
</P>
<P>
 "The victims are usually very ashamed and don't want to say anything," said 
Lt. Henry Batterton, a member of the security force at Leisure World in Laguna 
Hills. "They think to themselves, 'How could I possibly have been so dumb?' " 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two months, at least two Leisure World residents have fallen for 
the scam, including a retired military man who lost $2,000, Batterton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These scam artists are real sharp in their delivery and they get these poor 
folks involved," Batterton said. "Some of the people are so lonely and want to 
talk to someone. They'll talk to anyone about anything. Or you have the ones 
who want to be a do-gooder and assist in arresting the bad guys." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most recent cases involved two female victims, both in their 80s, 
from Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 A con artist first called an 83-year-old woman and asked her to assist in an 
internal bank investigation. Two days later, an 86-year-old woman was contacted 
and the same request was made, said Detective Manuel Ramos of the Brea Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Both women agreed to withdraw money from their accounts and take it to a 
nearby fast food restaurant, where they were told that a bank representative 
would be waiting for them, Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for these women, the scam fell apart. 
</P>
<P>
 The 86-year-old woman wasn't able to withdraw the money and arrived at the 
restaurant without it. She was told to try again on another day. Instead, she 
returned home and called police. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were also called after the 83-year-old woman, who couldn't find the 
restaurant, went back to her bank to redeposit the cash and told the bank 
teller what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most of the other victims, these two women were recent widows whose names 
were probably found by the con artists in newspaper obituaries, Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many of the victims have recently lost loved ones so they are traumatized 
twice," said Kinkade. "That's why this crime is so cruel." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Clemente victim was also a recent widow. Her husband of 40 years had 
died only two months before she was victimized. She said losing a "big chunk of 
my life savings" pushed her to the verge of a nervous breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to get over the loss of my husband when all this happened," she 
said. "I've had many sleepless nights. I'm $5,400 in the hole. I feel so little 
and low and so taken and so hurt. I just don't think I will ever get over it." 
</P>
<P>
 Leisure World officials said they try to do their best to warn residents of 
various scams that target the elderly by distributing flyers, holding seminars 
and running segments on their closed-circuit television station. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to keep residents updated on what to look for," Batterton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some banks, such as Bank of America, have mailed warnings of such scams along 
with customers' monthly statements and have instructed tellers to contact 
police or security if they suspect fraud, said spokeswoman Kirsten Salo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand that this kind of thing goes on and we want to do everything 
that we can to help customers avoid the situation," Salo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Salo said it is important for people to know that no federal, state or local 
law enforcement agency, or any bank official, would ever request that a 
customer withdraw money to participate in an internal bank investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tellers are trained to tactfully ask the reason for such a large cash 
withdrawal," Salo said. Customers "are to be warned of the danger of carrying 
large amounts of cash and are advised to accept a cashier's check." 
</P>
<P>
 Kinkade, who investigates economic crimes for the Sheriff's Department, said 
the only way to prevent the crime from happening is to educate senior citizens 
and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have to remember that when someone calls them on the phone, they are 
in control," he said. "They can stop it any time they want. I've never heard of 
a case where there was any kind of reprisal against anyone for hanging up the 
phone." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who is asked to participate in an internal bank investigation should 
try to get the caller's name and contact their bank branch manager or local 
police immediately, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, it has been extremely difficult for law enforcement officers to 
develop leads on local bank scam suspects because victims are often unable to 
give accurate physical descriptions of the people who took their money. Poor 
eyesight or a faulty memory is often the problem, Kinkade said.

'ZIGGURAT' FINALLY BECOMING A POWER STRUCTURE; CONSERVATION: LAGUNA NIGUEL'S 
LONGTIME LAUGHINGSTOCK GAINS NEW RESPECT AS CENTERPIECE OF NATIONAL 
ENERGY-SAVING PILOT PROGRAM. THE ANCIENT-LOOKING BUILDING SOON WILL BOAST 
ULTRA-MODERN EFFICIENCIES. 
</P>

<P>
 It was a laughingstock, a notorious 1.2-million-square-foot white elephant 
that people derisively called "the Ziggurat." 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the lonely pyramid-shaped building looked like it belonged 
somewhere in ancient Mesopotamia, not the flatlands of Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s and early 1980s, life was so scarce amid the virtually empty 
seven stories that federal workers had to routinely troop through all 48 
bathrooms, flushing the toilets just to keep the plumbing limbered up. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Chet Holifield Federal Building's day in the sun has finally come. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the butt of so many jokes has become the poster child of a unique 
energy-saving program designed to save money and please the conservation gurus, 
particularly Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
 The massive 26-year-old building -- now chock-full of federal tenants from the 
Internal Revenue Service to the National Archives -- has been chosen for a 
national pilot program. A statement from federal energy officials promises the 
undertaking will ultimately "save taxpayers millions of dollars in energy 
costs, eliminate thousands of tons of air pollutants and pump millions of 
dollars into the Southern California economy over the next several years." 
</P>
<P>
 Like everything at "the Ziggurat," it will be done on a grand scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Two giants of the private sector -- Southern California Edison and the 
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California -- have teamed with the 
federal government to retrofit the building and save an estimated $550,000 a 
year in utility costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first project like this, of this magnitude, that's ever been 
done," said Peter Gaddy, a spokesman for the government's General Services 
Agency, which oversees the building. "Our utility bills for the building were 
$2 million a year. This seemed like a likely candidate for saving taxpayer 
dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Gone will be the 1968-era plumbing, lighting, heating and air conditioning, 
and in their place will come state-of-the-1990s low-flush toilets, reclaimed 
water and a thermal cooling system. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest part of the savings, an estimated 71%, will come via a new 
ventilation system for the huge building, the GSA's third largest of 7,000 
facilities nationwide, Gaddy said. 
</P>
<P>
 And, officials say, the $3-million retrofitting won't cost taxpayers anything 
initially. 
</P>
<P>
 SoCal Edison, which will put up the money for the retrofit, will recoup its 
investment via an extra charge in the government's monthly utility bills after 
the retrofit yields a cost savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials will also be spared the hassle of going through a lengthy 
procurement process, according to Edgar Gray, the GSA official who runs the 
building and, in exemplary energy-saving fashion, walks to work from his Laguna 
Niguel home. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way," Gray said, "I'm not asking for additional money or additional 
taxes. That's the unique twist to this."  
</P>
<P>
 Such optimism is a relatively new feeling to emanate from the building nestled 
on 96 acres in what used to be a remote corner of south Orange County. Almost 
from the day construction was completed in the late 1960s, the building has 
been caught in a time warp. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed by Los Angeles architect William L. Pereira, who also designed UC 
Irvine and Los Angeles International Airport, it was conceived as the corporate 
offices and a light-manufacturing center for North American Rockwell. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the aerospace industry declined and Rockwell shelved plans to expand 
into South County, the building sat empty and ghostlike, surrounded by the 
weeds and sagebrush of then-undeveloped Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government came along in 1974 and rescued Rockwell, obtaining "the 
Ziggurat" in a deal that involved $22 million and an exchange of property. In 
1978, President Jimmy Carter named it the Chet Holifield Federal Building after 
the 32-year Democratic congressman from Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a decade, however, the government had little use for it and 
offered the building for sale, without any serious takers. But today it is 
bustling with federal employees, and has a day-care center for 100 children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We bit our lip and said we'll persevere and we're now glad we did," Gray 
said. "It's now one of the most valuable federal properties in our area." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 and an executive order signed 
last March by Vice President Gore and Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary 
mandating a 30% energy savings in all federal buildings by the year 2005, "the 
Ziggurat" will get its new infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to champion change and reinvent government, if you will," 
Edison sales and marketing director Richard Phelps said. "This is one way to do 
it."

AUTO BIOGRAPHY; NEW MUSEUM TO DEPICT L.A.'S CAR CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Welcome to Los Angeles' cultural world: Picassos, tar pits -- and, now, 
Chevys. 
</P>
<P>
 The Petersen Automotive Museum -- named after car magazine publisher Robert E. 
Petersen, who donated $15 million of its $40-million price tag -- opens 
Saturday in the long-vacant Ohrbach's department store at Wilshire Boulevard 
and Fairfax Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest addition to the County Museum of Natural History is designed to 
depict how the automobile shaped life in America's No. 1 car-loving city. 
</P>
<P>
 Just about everything with an internal combustion engine has a place here, 
from the cars of Hollywood stars to a three-wheel vehicle built by a 
transsexual con artist. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be the only museum in America where visitors wander over a fake roadway 
-- complete with a manhole cover -- that winds past exhibits ranging from a 
strip mall to a diner shaped like a bulldog. 
</P>
<P>
 It is supposed to be every bit as serious at its high-brow neighbors, the 
County Museum of Art and the George C. Page Museum at the La Brea Tar Pits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not just another shiny indoor parking lot," said James D. Olson, chief 
of exhibits. "We're trying to tell a story -- about the history of this city." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The new museum has taken a few knocks, however, because it opens at a time of 
deep financial difficulties for the natural history museum's main facility in 
Exposition Park and the Page Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a strange juxtaposition from a science-oriented museum to a museum that 
now seems controlled by the automotive interests," said James Zordich, retired 
curator of the Natural History Museum's transportation collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "The museum is sacrificing the vertebrate paleontology collection in favor of 
cars. It's ironic because at the present time, the automobile is a dirty word 
from an environmental point of view. Yet, dinosaurs are extremely popular -- 
look at Barney." 
</P>
<P>
 James L. Goedert, an amateur paleontologist who has worked with the museum, 
asked in a letter to Craig Black, director of the natural history museum, "just 
why is a car museum part of a Natural History Museum?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps the confusion you have," Black responded, "is that the museum's name 
only denotes 'natural' history, but it actually is a 'history' and 'natural 
history' museum." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials insist that no programs have been sacrificed to pay for the car 
museum, and that cars are every bit as important as dinosaurs to understanding 
our culture -- more so in this town. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officials believe that the car exhibit not only fits the institution's 
educational mission but could help save the rest of museums if it proves 
popular with the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sciences don't produce any money," said Mark A. Rodriguez, deputy 
director of the Natural History Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars have been part of the natural history museum's collection since the 
1920s. But most of them have been locked away in warehouses because of lack of 
exhibit space. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending their decision to build the museum, officials say that planning 
began before budget cuts were proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 And, they noted, the car museum is largely being built with private funds -- 
mostly from Petersen, son of a car mechanic and publisher of Motor Trend and 
Hot Rod magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of this was done with county money," Black said. "None of it was done 
with money that could have gone anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors in 1992 approved $28.5 million in tax-exempt 
financing for the car project. But the museum's private fund-raising arm is 
required to pay off most of the bonds. The county agreed to chip in $400,000 a 
year -- the amount of money the county saves by no longer having to rent 
storage space for its car collection. The private Natural History Museum 
Foundation is responsible for all operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Annual revenues are projected at $3.1 million -- more than double the money 
brought in by the museum's main facility in Exposition Park and the Page Museum 
combined. Attendance is projected at 700,000 to 800,000 visitors in its first 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics worry that if the car museum stalls, it will drain money from other 
museum programs. They note that some car museums elsewhere in the country have 
closed their doors or barely manage to break even because of poor attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials say the car museum -- featuring Disneyland-like special effects 
-- will appeal not just to gear heads but to everyone, even the fine arts 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if you're not interested in cars, you're going to be interested in this 
for the history lesson," Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even the new museum's critics concede that the car helped shape Los Angeles, 
fueling the city's growth while contributing to the demise of a public 
transportation system once known as the "world's largest interurban electrical 
railway." It also caused two of the region's biggest problems: smog and 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The world's first drive-in grocery store and drive-in church originated here. 
So did radio traffic reports. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, Southern California's lifestyle influenced the development and 
refinement of the car, giving birth to the convertible and smog equipment. 
Here, the car was not just a way to get to work -- it was a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 cars of historical importance will be displayed -- including a 1984 
Buick used to pace the torch relay leading up to the Los Angeles Summer 
Olympics, the three-wheeled Dale built in the 1970s by transsexual con artist 
Elizabeth Carmichael, a 1932 Duesenberg, a Model-T, a Helms Bakery truck and a 
1922 Leach. 
</P>
<P>
 (Surely you remember the Leach? "They were built in Los Angeles," said Leslie 
Kendall, manager of the automobile collection for the Petersen. Fewer than 500 
Leaches were built. Probably because the car sold in 1922 for $6,200 -- equal 
to the cost of a dozen Model-Ts.) 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, no Los Angeles museum would be complete without a Hollywood 
connection. Cars of the stars will be displayed, as will cars that starred in 
movies and TV. Jean Harlow's Packard is on exhibit, as is Clark Gable's 
Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
 So is Jack Benny's Chrysler Imperial -- the one he actually drove. (The 
Maxwell, the cheap heap that he made famous in his routines, is at the Imperial 
Palace Auto Collection in Las Vegas, but will be available on loan to the 
Petersen, as will Marilyn Monroe's pink convertible and Liberace's Rolls-Royce, 
covered with -- what else? -- candelabra.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood exhibit already has earned the museum a spot on the itinerary of 
at least one sightseeing tour company. "These guys got real excited when we 
told them we're going to have Hollywood celebrity mannequins along with their 
cars," Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Curators take particular pride in the historically precise settings created 
for the collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars are exhibited among streetscapes such as a strip mall, a drive-in 
restaurant and a replica of the Dog Cafe that once stood on Washington 
Boulevard in Culver City. The exhibits illustrate how the car influenced life 
in Southern California -- the diner shaped like a dog shows how buildings were 
designed to grab the attention of passing motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 A wrecked Toyota also is on display to demonstrate how the death toll from 
automobile accidents brought about new safety features -- air bags and seat 
belts. 
</P>
<P>
 Car art also is featured. Opening exhibits include a photo-collage of auto 
junkyards and a display of coffins carved with the likenesses of cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The new museum will appeal to all the senses. An apple pie smell will waft out 
of a replica of a California bungalow, and sparks will crackle noisily from the 
wires above an old-time trolley car. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials will even let patrons slide behind the wheel of a few vehicles. "You 
can't put 200 cars in a place and not have any of them be touchable," curator 
Matt Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Volpert, an attorney who heads the Natural History Museum Foundation, 
called the car museum "an intelligent gamble." 
</P>
<P>
 "For our museum to survive, we have to have a presence beyond Exposition 
Park," he said. "Like it or not, Exposition Park is a tough place to draw 
people," in part because of safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 James Powell, a geologist who has been named to succeed the retiring Black, 
believes that the car museum will open up new sources of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are wealthy people who are interested in automobiles who don't happen 
to be interested in dinosaurs or birds or fossils or minerals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who welcome the new museum is George C. Page, founder of the 
fossil museum that bears his name -- the same facility that has been cut to the 
bone by county budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that brings more people to the area helps my museum," said the 
93-year-old Page. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum has come up with an unusual fund-raising gambit: offering $20,000 
donors the chance to become a gas station attendant or car salesman in the 
museum by having their face sculpted onto a mannequin. So far, no one has taken 
them up on the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission to the Petersen is $7 for adults and $3 for children between 5 and 
12 years old, free for those under 5. The museum is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
daily and 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Fridays.

GAME GIVES PASADENA TASTE OF WORLD CUP FEVER; SOCCER: U.S.-MEXICO EXHIBITION 
MATCHUP AT ROSE BOWL DRAWS 90,000 FANS. WITH FREEWAYS SNARLED, SOME WALK MILES 
TO REACH THE STADIUM.

<P>
 Pasadena got a dress rehearsal for the upcoming World Cup festivities 
Saturday, as 90,000 or so soccer fans descended on the Rose Bowl for an 
exhibition game between the United States and Mexico, snarling traffic on two 
freeways and testing the resources of a massive law enforcement contingent. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fans waited for three hours or longer as they worked their way toward the 
stadium in cars and on foot. Vehicles overheated on the Pasadena and Foothill 
freeways, and some people abandoned their vehicles miles from the Rose Bowl, 
choosing to walk or run the last few miles instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to park three miles away," said Jonathan Rosales, whose dash to the 
stadium in the afternoon heat left his red, white and blue face paint dripping 
off his chin. "It's a mess." 
</P>
<P>
 By late afternoon, the highways were awash in soccer enthusiasm and a sea of 
Mexican flags, with a few stars and stripes among them. The game was won by the 
United States, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 From one South Pasadena back yard, the Pasadena Freeway looked like a giant, 
festive parking lot: flags flying, car horns honking, passengers blowing 
plastic trumpets in rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 Some homeowners complained that the festivities made them prisoners of their 
own neighborhoods. "So many people. They're so excited. But not me; so many 
cars," said Emily Cheng, who was taking a walk around the Rose Bowl grounds 
while her car stayed parked a few blocks away at her Linda Vista Avenue home. 
"I wouldn't go anywhere today." 
</P>
<P>
 Bracing for Saturday's exhibition, officials from 40 federal, state and local 
law enforcement agencies fired up their joint operations command post near the 
Rose Bowl in a run-through for the monthlong series of soccer games that begins 
in Southern California on June 18 and that will draw hundreds of thousands of 
tourists to the region. Authorities said they were generally pleased by 
Saturday's event and added that they expect the traffic problems to abate 
during the World Cup games because fans will be better prepared and advised to 
arrive earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Although tempers occasionally flared, especially as game time drew near, once 
inside the stadium fans were well-behaved. Police -- who blanketed the 
facility, some on foot, others on horseback -- reported little trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is really good," said sheriff's Deputy Phil Morris. "There's been 
a lot of horn-blowing, whistling and carrying on, but once they got in, they've 
been having a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 By night's end, only two people were arrested in connection with the event. 
"Everything was as calm as could be," said Pasadena police Cmdr. Mary Schander. 
</P>
<P>
 A last-minute sellout stirred some concern among security officials because it 
meant that late-arriving fans without tickets would be turned away, 
complicating the thick traffic congestion at the stadium. Crowds of fans, many 
still bearing flags, slumped on sidewalks, dejected at missing a game that some 
had traveled all day to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look and look and look," said David Moyal, who searched for tickets for 
more than an hour with his brother before giving up. "But we don't find." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Trevino came all the way from San Bernardino and fumed about not being 
able to buy a ticket. "I think this country underestimates the power of 
soccer," he said, as Rose Bowl staff shooed away those without tickets. "People 
go to war over soccer games." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the frenzy in Pasadena, two other events -- a chili cook-off and a 
chalk street painting demonstration -- drew their share of visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 By late afternoon, the streets of Old Town were bustling and merchants said 
business was booming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything's going really well," said Leah Martinez, a manager at the Market 
City Caffe in Old Town. "It's a lot of different people, but everyone's getting 
along." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials had encouraged soccer fans to arrive early -- the parking lots 
opened at 11:30 a.m. and the stadium at 1:30 p.m. for a 4:30 p.m. game. But 
only a few cars trickled in by early afternoon, heightening fears of a major 
traffic snarl in the making. 
</P>
<P>
 By 3 p.m., with crowds at the stadium still relatively light, authorities were 
asking news radio stations to broadcast word that fans should head to the 
stadium as soon as possible or risk long waits once they arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the hour, thousands of fans began arriving at the stadium, many waving 
large flags. 
</P>
<P>
 The flags posed a minor problem for officials. While flag-waving fans are a 
common sight at soccer games abroad, authorities have barred flagpoles from the 
World Cup games this year because they are concerned about the possibility of 
their being used as weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, officials detached flags from poles as fans arrived at the gates. 
The poles were confiscated, and the process tied up entry into the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 With the first World Cup game slated for the Rose Bowl on June 18, officials 
have been working out security plans for more than a year and had planned to 
use Saturday's game as a dry run. That meant that agents and officers from 
dozens of law enforcement agencies were on hand for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 State transportation officials and California Highway Patrol officers tried to 
steer traffic into the facility and to prevent backups on the highway. Crowd 
control at the Rose Bowl itself was primarily the responsibility of Pasadena 
police, but they were joined by sheriff's deputies on horseback. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agents and representatives of other police departments were on hand in 
case trouble erupted and reinforcements were needed. None were. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had planned this as a final dress rehearsal," said Pasadena Police Cmdr. 
Mary L. Schander, whose department is the lead agency for security in and 
around the Rose Bowl. "It was a good thing because we needed it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the traffic tie-ups irritated some soccer fans, security officials 
say they expect the situation to be better once the World Cup games begin. Fans 
are traveling from around the world to attend those games and will receive 
packets of information instructing them on where to be in order to ensure that 
they do not miss any of the action.

U.S. COURT PANEL URGES SUSPENSION OF OUTSPOKEN LAWYER; LAW: PANEL RULES THAT 
STEPHEN YAGMAN SHOULD NOT PRACTICE IN FEDERAL COURT FOR 15 MONTHS. ATTORNEY HAD 
CALLED A JUDGE ANTI-SEMITIC AND DISHONEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Facing the harshest professional discipline of his career, Stephen Yagman was 
taking an uncharacteristic course.  
</P>
<P>
 He was keeping his mouth shut. 
</P>
<P>
 Such circumspection was a change of pace for the veteran Venice civil rights 
lawyer, whose proclivity for outrageous comments landed him in trouble in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
 This, after all, is the man who once called former Deputy Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher a "weasel" and a "white-bread, Establishment, uptown guy who 
doesn't want to sully his mitts on police brutality except from his ivory 
tower." 
</P>
<P>
 He's the one who accused U.S. District Judge Manuel L. Real of having mental 
disorders, branded state Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas a racist and an 
anti-Semite, described former Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley as an Uncle Tom and 
called former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates the personification of 
the devil. 
</P>
<P>
 His current troubles started after he accused a federal judge, William D. 
Keller, of being anti-Semitic, drunk on the bench, dishonest and "one of the 
worst judges in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, a special federal court disciplinary committee recommended that 
Yagman be suspended from practicing in federal court in Los Angeles for 15 
months because he "impugned the integrity" of the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the committee also recommended that as a precondition of being 
allowed to practice again Yagman should be required to pass the 90-minute 
Professional Responsibility Examination administered by the State Bar of 
California for all suspended and disbarred lawyers seeking reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Friday, the normally voluble Yagman deferred all comment to his lawyer, 
former U.S. Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark. "The recommendation of 15 months is 
grossly excessive," Clark said. "Our main interest is in establishing to the 
benefit of justice that Steve Yagman's conduct is not a violation of any 
professional canon." 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman has 14 days to respond to the proposed suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 If imposed, it could have a severe impact on the 49-year-old attorney, who 
practices almost exclusively in federal court in Los Angeles, a courthouse 
whose jurisdiction covers seven Southern California counties from Riverside to 
San Luis Obispo. He specializes in representing people who contend that they 
have been victims of police misconduct and is considered one of the most 
successful attorneys of that type in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-member disciplinary committee recommended the suspension after a ruling 
by a panel of three Los Angeles federal judges, who issued a decision May 18 
condemning Yagman's remarks about their colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 "The panel finds no evidence that Judge Keller is in fact anti-Semitic or that 
(Yagman) had a reasonable basis for making such accusations," wrote Judges John 
G. Davies, Edward Rafeedie and David W. Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges -- who will rule on Yagman's penalty after hearing his response -- 
also said that the attorney "has made no effort to explain his accusations that 
Judge Keller is dishonest or drunk on the bench," and that, considering the 
absence of supporting evidence, they assumed the charges to be false. 
</P>
<P>
 After that ruling, the unrepentant Yagman went on the attack again, calling 
former President Ronald Reagan, who appointed Davies and Rafeedie, "odious," 
and labeling former President Richard Nixon, who appointed Williams, "a proven 
anti-Semite." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest Yagman ripostes were cited as a kind of footnote to the whole 
affair in a brief filed by disciplinary committee attorney Graham E. Berry. 
Berry pointed to the comments as an example of Yagman's attempts "to wrap 
himself in a mantle of moral superiority while falsely asserting that his 
critics condemn him not for his misconduct, but for his sociopolitical beliefs 
and affiliations." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a decade ago, Real imposed a $250,000 sanction on Yagman that later was 
reversed by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Yagman also was suspended 
from practice by the State Bar for six months in 1989 for being "hostile, 
forceful and aggressive" with his clients and ordered him to undergo 
psychiatric counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest Yagman flap has prompted controversy in the legal community. 
</P>
<P>
 Several lawyers, including Gerald L. Chaleff, president of the Los Angeles 
County Bar Assn., criticized the efforts to punish Yagman. "I have a problem 
with the basic premise of penalizing him," Chaleff said. "While I do not 
condone Mr. Yagman's language, he certainly has a right to state his opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal lawyer Harland W. Braun, one of the few other Los Angeles attorneys 
who will publicly take on federal judges, was more critical. "The idea that 
someone is being disciplined for impugning the integrity of a public official 
is ridiculous, because that is the . . . core principle of the 1st Amendment -- 
that a citizen has a right to criticize a public official." 
</P>
<P>
 But New York University law professor Stephen Gillers, who specializes in 
legal ethics issues, said Yagman ought to be sanctioned. "While I consider 
myself a strong 1st Amendment adherent, I have no sympathy for this criticism 
(Yagman's comments on Keller) -- wild ad hominem charges." 
</P>
<P>
 Gillers said cases of this type are on the rise and reflect increasing concern 
"about the loss of civility in litigation." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Yagman managed to keep quiet all of Friday, but by midday 
Saturday, he just couldn't resist saying something. He left the following 
message on a reporter's answering machine: 
</P>
<P>
 "When one does what one believes to be right, and others attack based on that, 
it's OK."

SCOTT HARRIS: A SOLEMN MILITARY TRADITION LIVES ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The old photo is tucked inside a plastic slip, protecting the memory of the 
crew of The Liberty Run. Fifty years ago, Bill Rochat protected the crew with a 
machine gun. He was a ball turret gunner who saw the war from the belly of a 
B-17 in 25 missions over Nazi territory, including five over Berlin. He would 
have died with these men, if not for some skill, some luck and some answered 
prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to know their names?" One by one, Rochat points them out. "William 
Miller from Nebraska. Huck Harrison from Texas. That's myself. I enlisted here 
in Los Angeles. Ray Glasser. He was our tail gunner. And that's Washco. Ray 
Washco from Chicago. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 On this morning, Bill Rochat, who is 72, is wearing a natty khaki uniform 
accented with a white dickey, a white shoulder braid, black boots and a brown 
campaign cap trimmed in gold lettering that identifies him as a member of 
Veterans of Foreign War Ship 8310 in Burbank. This is a "ship," not a post, 
because the unit is named after the Gudgeon, a submarine sunk in the Pacific 
during World War II. A memorial plaque, bearing the names of the 80 men who 
died on the Gudgeon, is erected near the ship's flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Rochat totes a rifle and a Bible. He is the chaplain of a VFW drill team, 
which on this day has an appointment in Downey. It is the team's duty to 
provide the sad pomp required of a military funeral -- a prayer, a 21-gun 
salute, the playing of "Taps." Chances are, not a single member of this drill 
team knew the veteran they are burying this day. But he is a comrade just the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't so long ago the military would routinely provide these services for 
any veteran. Lou DeSantis, a Korea veteran who is captain of the Gudgeon drill 
team, says it is now usually up to the VFW to provide such a service, not to 
mention ceremonial appearances on Memorial Day and Veterans Day. In the last 
eight months, he says, VFW members have assisted at a dozen funerals. 
</P>
<P>
 They do it to honor the memory of all veterans, because, as John DeBasion puts 
it, "a lot of people don't know what happened, and some don't care." These men 
are ever at the ready in an America that today tends to be episodic in its 
tributes. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor occurred three years ago. My father was 
at Ewa, not far from Pearl, when the Zeroes arrived. Like the other Marines, he 
grabbed a rifle and returned fire. Historians say that one Zero was downed by 
small arms fire at Ewa. I prefer to think my father fired the critical shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes the 50th anniversary of D-day. Among the 375 members of VFW Ship 
8310 are three men who participated in the invasion of Normandy. W.R. "Web" 
Raduenz and Victor Estrada were paratroopers who dropped behind German lines. 
Rochat was in The Liberty Run. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, Raduenz says, nothing fuzzy or distant about the memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most of us think about it quite often," he says. "You read something 
in the paper and it gets you thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Raduenz was stationed near Exeter. For a week, maybe two, the men studied 
their mission. "The town was off limits. They kept us behind barbed wire, to 
keep a guy from going into a pub and spilling his guts to some broad." 
</P>
<P>
 It was about midnight when their plane reached the English Channel and the 
antiaircraft fire. The flak exploded all around. Tracers raced through the sky. 
"Every one was aimed right at you," Raduenz says. "At least it looked that 
way." And the enemy fire continued as they parachuted to earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Liberty Run, Rochat says, escorted generals who were monitoring the 
progress of the invasion. Unfortunately, Rochat says, the German camouflage was 
so effective near Ste. Lo, "We bombed our own people. . . . Things like that 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Estrada has traveled to France to attend the observance in Normandy. 
Another American who will participate is President Clinton, who famously 
avoided service in Vietnam. For this reason, the veterans regard Clinton with 
ambivalence, to put it mildly. Many expressed personal resentment toward 
Clinton, the man, but a patriotic respect for the office of President and 
commander in chief. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of vets talk about this. I think it's a disgrace we have a President 
who's a draft dodger," DeBasion says. 
</P>
<P>
 Another veteran expressed similar sentiments, yet was more outraged by the 
reports that a man had disrupted a Clinton speech with catcalls of "draft 
dodger." "I think that guy should have been taken out and shot," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is not a time to talk politics. The drill team, having gathered its 
World War I vintage rifles and its blank shells, is now ready. Rochat has his 
Bible. And 74-year-old Dez Tenke, who fought at Saipan, has his bugle. The 
car-pool is waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 DeSantis fishes from his pocket the notes for this mission. On this day, they 
will offer a final salute to Richard Vargas, who as a young man had served in 
World War II as a seaman in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 They have performed the ritual many times. First, a rifle with fixed bayonet 
is stabbed into the earth, and a helmet is placed atop the butt to symbolize a 
battlefield grave marker. Then Rochat reads a prayer from the Book of Nehemiah. 
Three rounds are fired from seven rifles. Then Dez Tenke plays "Taps." And, 
finally, the flag is folded and presented to the next of kin. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenke has played the sad tune many, many times. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very good," Rochat says. "He'll tear your heart out." 
</P>

READERS REVIEW 'ORDINARY PEOPLE'; TIMESLINK: 150 CALL OR FAX TO RESPOND TO 
ARTICLE EXPLORING HOW ONE TEACHER USES THE CONTROVERSIAL NOVEL AND COMMENT ON 
THE ISSUE OF CENSORSHIP IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After reading a Times article last week exploring how the book "Ordinary 
People" is taught in one Orange County classroom, Rene Kogel of Laguna Beach 
wanted to "commend the teacher for her personal courage in teaching this book." 
Ditto for Orange resident Sue Guilford, who "would be delighted to have my 
child in that classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 But not Mary Grondie of Anaheim, who said the book "should certainly be thrown 
in the trash bin." And at Leisure World, Marian Garner said she and several 
friends "think the teacher ought to be squashed." 
</P>
<P>
 The four were among some 150 people who called or faxed The Times' reader 
response line to comment on "Ordinary People" and the issue of censorship in 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Published in 1976 and later made into a movie that won the Academy Award for 
Best Picture, Judith Guest's novel has been taught in local English classes for 
more than a decade and has been the subject of political debate in schools 
around the nation for just as long. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ordinary People" tells the tale of teen-ager Conrad Jarrett, who grew up 
pampered in suburban Chicago, then lost big brother Buck in a boating accident. 
Depressed, Conrad slits his wrists. He survives, but throughout the book 
readers wonder whether his family will. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, some parents asked the Anaheim Union High School District to remove 
the book from its approved reading list, complaining that it is laced with 
profanity and its depiction of teen sex, mental illness, family dysfunction and 
suicide is inappropriate for school-age children. The school board retained the 
book, and a recall movement against several trustees failed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the debate continues, as shown by the large and varied response to The 
Times' article that focused on English teacher Lucy Swindell and her five 
sophomore English classes at John F. Kennedy High School in La Palma. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls came from virtually every Orange County city, with about 40% of callers 
opposing the book's inclusion in school curriculum and the rest praising it. 
Among the callers were parents, grandparents, teachers and professors, a 
23-year-old man and an 80-year-old woman. There was a marriage/family counselor 
and a librarian, a member of the liberal group People for the American Way and 
several avid churchgoers.  
</P>
<P>
 Some described the book as "excellent" while others saw it as "erotic trash." 
</P>
<P>
 One woman told of a straight-A student she knew who got his first F at age 17 
from a teacher who wrote, "You're not as smart as you think you are" on his 
paper. The boy hung himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where was the teacher that listened, inspired and encouraged him to believe 
that he could accomplish his dreams?" asked Jean Casey of Huntington Beach, an 
education professor at Cal State Long Beach. "Perhaps he could be the 
neurosurgeon he dreamed of becoming if he had been in Lucy Swindell's 
classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here are excerpts of other readers' comments: 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of teaching literature, Lucy Swindell ends up being a sort of pop 
psychologist teaching values. What are her qualifications for leading these 
types of discussions? It all comes down to values. Whose values should be 
taught in public schools: Judith Guest's, Lucy Swindell's, mine, yours?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sue Sailhamer, Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who are trying to censor these books in public schools are 
jerkosauruses." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lou Cohan, Cypress 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "No child should be forced to grow up in an imperfect society where the 
imperfections are never acknowledged. Teen-agers do hear, and use, foul 
language. Teen-agers do get horny and do have sex. And some teen-agers do 
consider -- even attempt -- suicide." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Angela Waterman, Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We built this whole country on the fact that we are free and freedom does 
come from reading books." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pat McGraw, Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not want it to be taught to my children." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cindy Ball-Kingston, Westminster 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I applaud and commend the rich tradition of censorship in this country, I can 
think of no better way to generate interest in a book than to have it (banned). 
When I think of the vast numbers of thrill-seeking young scholars who will, as 
a result of your front-page story, seek out and read 'Ordinary People,' my 
faith in the future of mankind is restored." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Richard Kreis, La Palma 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that she uses this book to titillate and provoke a classroom 
discussion about family secrets is shameful. Why isn't she teaching Shakespeare 
or how to write a good paragraph or fill out a job application? All families 
have problems, but the classroom is not equipped to solve them -- kids need to 
learn how to use the English language properly before they use precious 
classroom time on problems they are incapable of really solving." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wendy Leece, Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that 'Ordinary People' is a disgustingly trashy book, I think it 
should be banned along with any other books that are vulgar in language and 
obscene and explicit in subject matter. We are living in perilous times. Jesus 
Christ is coming soon. A book like this is not giving glory to God." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Carol McCabe, Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider myself a very religious person but do not agree with others of my 
faith who wish to hide from the world." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bruce Borden, Tustin 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that reading a book like 'Ordinary People' is going to lead to 
teen suicide or teen-agers having sex. I think real life is about that, and 
this is just a story about real life." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lani Anzizino, Seal Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There are other ways to teach what she's after. I think that the same lessons 
can be learned without using a book that's this controversial. I think she's 
out of line and I would protest also if my child were reading that book." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Leslie Ebert, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Lucy Swindell is doing more than teaching her students life lessons from the 
book 'Ordinary People.' . . . She is showing us that if we don't start to look 
at what is really going on in our lives, nothing will really change. She is 
also showing us that among our high school students, the language, sex, drugs 
and violence are not the real problems -- they are the symptoms of the real 
problems. She is helping her students see that each of them is an extraordinary 
person and they are not victims of life as most of them -- and us -- believe we 
are. Adding more money and computers and banning a few books will not in the 
long run improve the quality of our schools and society, but more teachers like 
Lucy Swindell will." 
</P>
<P>
 -- David McClelland, Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There's absolutely nothing valuable for the students coming from this book. 
It's doing a lot more harm than good." 
</P>

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; AND 
NOW, HERE ARE THE WINNERS OF CAMPAIGN HIGHLIGHTS AWARDS . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the June primary campaign season draws to a close, Politics '94 issues 
awards for some campaign highlights and dedicates this column to the candidates 
whose names will appear on Tuesday's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Zeke and Ted's Excellent Adventure Award: To Democratic candidates Zeke 
Hernandez, a businessman, and Ted R. Moreno, a Santa Ana councilman, who gave 
us vintage intraparty animosity as they sparred and jabbed relentlessly in the 
69th Assembly District race. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez accused the Santa Ana councilman of everything from offering bribes 
to get him out of the race to overbilling taxpayers for home exercise 
equipment. Moreno charged that Hernandez illegally taped a phone conversation 
the pair had. With only two campaign days left, we're holding onto our seats 
for the grand finale in this Democratic primary race that also features two 
other Democrats -- Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce President Mike Metzler and 
Santa Ana businessman John M. Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most Enlightening Television Debate Award: To KOCE-TV's free-for-all debate in 
the same 69th Assembly District race that featured the nine Democratic, 
Libertarian and Republican candidates bunched up together on the same platform. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience could learn plenty about the candidates -- not just from their 
stated positions on the issues, but from their behavior on the program. Sweaty 
brows and mudslinging were standard fare during the one-hour program that had 
many low lights, including Moreno's claim that one of his Democratic opponents, 
Metzler, should not be preaching "family values" because he got a divorce and 
remarried. Tell that to former President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 There were many other unforgettable moments. Patterson, the Democrat, 
intending to criticize the political baggage of the other candidates, said: 
"Everybody sitting here is bringing something to the table. I am the only 
candidate that brings nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Postwar Hero Award: To Rep. Jay C. Kim (R-Diamond Bar), whose recent mailer 
included a letter by Rep. David Dreier (R-San Dimas) stating that Kim "served 
side-by-side with U.S. troops in Korea." Opponents cried foul, claiming it was 
impossible for Kim to have served in the Korean War since he would have been 
only 11 years old at the time. But the congressman's office said Kim -- the 
first Korean American elected to Congress -- joined the Korean military after 
the war when he was 17, serving alongside U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Missing in Action Award: To Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), who was 
strangely missing in action during the primary season. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan, who has earned a national following from his zesty appearances on 
C-SPAN and as a guest host on the Rush Limbaugh radio talk show, was all over 
the place two years ago while producing a double-digit drubbing of primary 
rival Judith Ryan, the darling of abortion rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Dornan, running unopposed in the primary, stayed put in Washington, 
to the chagrin of "politiholics" who can't get enough of the congressman's 
ravings and revelations. But he was busy behind the scenes, anticipating the 
winner of the six-way shootout in the Democratic primary. Dornan amassed a 
$473,000 war chest this year -- at least seven times the amount raised by the 
best-financed Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Missing in Action 2 Award: To Huntington Beach Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson, 
who is running for the 2nd District seat on the County Board of Supervisors. 
"She is not in the office. She is running for county supervisor and has left 
instructions that she won't be back in the office until after the primary," a 
City Hall staff member told a caller last week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most-Sought-After Endorsement Award: To state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport 
Beach), whose name keeps popping up on campaign brochures and letters on behalf 
of Republican candidates Marilyn C. Brewer and Thomas G. Reinecke in the 70th 
Assembly District race, even though Bergeson continues to proclaim her 
neutrality in that race. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most Prolific Criminal Award: To the dark-haired man aiming a gun in a recent 
campaign mailer sent out by Irvine Councilman Barry J. Hammond, one of three 
Republican candidates in the 70th Assembly District race. "He just got out of 
prison . . . and he's in your neighborhood," the caption reads. 
</P>
<P>
 But the "gunman" also seems to be elsewhere in Orange County. The same photo 
with the same caption appeared a few days later in a campaign brochure for Jim 
Morrissey, a Republican candidate in the 69th Assembly District race. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 P.C. Award: These are politically correct times, so who better for this award 
than Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg, who is running for state attorney general, wins the award because he 
returned a $40,000 check from a casino owned by the Morongo Indians. Umberg's 
handlers said they worried the money could be considered "tainted" because the 
casino's outside management team was served with federal indictments. 
Undeterred, they expressed hope that the group would make another campaign 
contribution from an account not associated with the casino. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rhythm Stick Award: To the tagger who scrawled "Spank Me" on the front 
entrance to the district office of Assemblyman Mickey Conroy in Orange, after 
the Republican lawmaker sponsored a bill that would require public paddlings of 
convicted juvenile graffiti vandals. 
</P>

PRIDE OF LIONS; MORE THAN 300 ENTRANTS MARCH IN PARADE, PART OF A 3-DAY 
FESTIVAL IN COSTA MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Kindergarten-age baton twirlers decked out in sequins, the El Bekal Shrine 
Temple Ali Baba Sheiks, and more than a dozen school bands from across the Los 
Angeles Basin marched past delighted crowds under a beating sun Saturday at the 
49th annual Lions Parade Spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade was part of a three-day fish fry and carnival that began Friday and 
continues today in Lions Park. Organizers said they expect to draw a crowd of 
75,000 over the weekend and raise more than $100,000 for a host of charities, 
including the UC Irvine Organ and Tissue Bank, the Boys and Girls Club and the 
Costa Mesa Little League. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like we're going to do extremely well this year. But we don't want 
it to get too hot, or people will go to the beach," said Mike Scheafer, 
president of the Costa Mesa-Newport Harbor Lions Club, which sponsors the event 
and has raised more than $1.6 million for charity in the previous 48 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the parade was canceled for the first time ever due to rain, but 
Saturday's event was graced by hot weather and clear skies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just love to watch the small kids trying their best," said Felix Duatin, 
74, who lives in the nearby Bethel Towers for senior citizens and trained a 
small video camera on the flag girls and pint-sized baton twirlers. "I've come 
almost every year for 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 "We come to watch the kids enjoying themselves," said Torribio Ortega, of 
Costa Mesa, as he tussled with his 4-year-old daughter, Marisela, and covered 
her with pink Silly String. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 entrants -- bands, drill teams, veterans organizations and local 
businesses -- participated in the parade, which closed Harbor Boulevard at 
Wilson Street and caused mild traffic snarls. Many who took part -- like the 
Pearl Harbor Survivors' Assn. brigade decked out in Hawaiian shirts -- did so 
this year in honor of the 50th anniversary of D-day. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Arroyo said she has attended the parade and fish fry since she was a 
teen-ager and came Saturday in part to root for Estancia High School, her alma 
mater where her son now goes to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Lions do so much for people. We try to spend as much money here as we can 
because we know it all goes to helping others," said Arroyo, 36, of Costa Mesa, 
whose sister had free eye surgery a decade ago thanks to the Lions Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica Romo, 17, came with her cousin, 14-year-old Lei Lani Castro, to cheer 
on Estancia High School, also. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've come here every year since we were really small," she said of the 
parade. "It's mostly just to see the bands, and the clowns." 
</P>
<P>
 One highlight Saturday was the parade's grand marshal -- 13-year-old actor and 
former Costa Mesa resident Austin O'Brien. O'Brien, who starred in "My Girl 2" 
and co-starred in "Last Action Hero," met with high-pitched screams of 
adulation from a mob of middle-school girls when he took the stage during award 
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 The big thrill for O'Brien, however, was riding in the old Plymouth 
convertible at the front of the parade: "It was crazy," he said. "It was a 
really cool car." 
</P>
<P>
 The fish fry and carnival continues from noon to 8 p.m. today at Lions Park, 
at Park Avenue near 18th Street.

CELEBRATING THEIR VICTORY OVER CANCER; HEALTH: MORE THAN 500 FORMER PATIENTS, 
THEIR FRIENDS AND DOCTORS ATTEND FESTIVAL FOR SURVIVORS OF THE DISEASE IN 
NEWPORT BEACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Dr. Robert O. Dillman had welcome words Saturday for the estimated 10,285 
people in Orange County whose cancer will be diagnosed this year. 
</P>
<P>
 New advances in the treatment of the disease make the chances for survival 
substantially better than ever, said Dillman, an oncologist and the medical 
director of the Patty & George Hoag Cancer Center, where more than 500 doctors, 
cancer survivors and friends attended Saturday's sixth annual "Celebration of 
Life" festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't panic and give up hope," Dillman said. "It's not likely there will ever 
be a single cure for cancer. But . . . the variety of treatments now available 
are leading to major gains in terms of survival. Cancer patients overall now 
have a 50-50 chance of living five more years, where 30 years ago it was only 
one in four." 
</P>
<P>
 The cancer center, next to Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian, was one of 
many institutions nationwide to celebrate National Cancer Survivors' Day, which 
recognizes the country's 8 million cancer survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing yellow "I'm a Cancer Survivor" badges, the former patients mingled 
with friends and family, were entertained by music and dancers and dined on 
barbecued chicken and corn-on-the-cob. 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Dunne, her close-cropped hair a badge of her recent chemotherapy 
treatments, offered her own words of advice for future cancer patients: Prepare 
to do battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you have to right away make up your mind you're going to fight like 
hell and you're going to make it," said Dunne, 31, a Laguna Beach resident. 
"You have to have a strong will to live -- and fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Her breast cancer was diagnosed in August, 1993, and she has since undergone 
surgery and an aggressive, high-dosage chemotherapy treatment. She is now 
considered cancer-free and is back at work as a landscape architect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of glad I was 30 when I went through this," Dunne said. "I faced 
death -- it was right there, smack in front of me. Because of that, now little 
stuff doesn't bug me. My work is more intense and my play is more intense." 
</P>
<P>
 Cancer survivor Chuck Kalberg made his way around the crowd in shorts and a 
sport shirt, his healthy tan belying the fact he too had recently faced death. 
Five years ago this spring, Kalberg, a resident of Laguna Hills, discovered a 
lump in his groin that was diagnosed as testicular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was ready to pack it in," Kalberg, 47, said. "I had seen all the television 
shows and heard the horror stories, where cancer is a big drain on the family 
and you wind up dying poor and penniless. I told the doctor I'm willing to take 
a calculated risk, but, if it's only a 10% chance, I'm not going to put my 
family through it." 
</P>
<P>
 But like Dunne, Kalberg wound up surviving a series of high-dosage 
chemotherapy treatments that can be nearly fatal themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think attitude is a big part of it," Kalberg said. "You can't spend a lot 
of time wondering 'Why me?' My doctor said it was probably a cell from birth 
that had been dormant all those years. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to spend whatever strength you have in fighting it and beating it." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the women in the crowd who had lost their hair from chemotherapy 
wore hats and bandannas to protect themselves from the midday sun. 
</P>
<P>
 With a disease like cancer, each of the stories is unique, Dillman said. One 
of the most difficult things about treating cancer is that it is a different 
disease in every patient, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each of us is the product of our parents," Dillman said. "Just as we look 
different, our cancers are different."

LOCAL ELECTIONS / LONG BEACH, SANTA MONICA; DIVERGENT CHOICES FOR CITIES IN 
FLUX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUKE HELFAND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a city many see as at a crossroads, the Long Beach mayoral runoff has 
offered voters a clear-cut choice between a tough-talking veteran of local 
political wars and a refined academic making her debut as a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 The race, one of a handful of municipal contests in the county on Tuesday's 
ballot, pits Long Beach City Councilman Ray Grabinski against former Long Beach 
City College President Beverly O'Neill. Grabinski, 50, is a former pizza parlor 
owner who brings a no-nonsense approach to issues. O'Neill, 63, is known as an 
administrator who uses a personal touch to forge alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 Their differing proposals to stem Long Beach's crime problem may best 
illustrate their contrasts -- O'Neill calls for adding 150 police officers; 
Grabinski emphasizes the need for gang prevention programs and after-school 
recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 What remains to be seen is whether Grabinski will be more hurt than helped by 
his eight years on the council and whether O'Neill -- who captured the highest 
number of votes among 13 candidates in the April primary -- can persuade voters 
that she is ready to lead the state's fifth-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach voters also could take a historic step by electing Latinos to the 
nine-member City Council for the first time. Two Latina candidates are making 
strong bids for council seats, and their election would build on Latino 
political gains earned in other cities nationwide in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere on Tuesday, voters in Santa Monica will choose between competing 
visions for their aging Civic Center. Proponents of a measure to rejuvenate the 
45-acre site near the Santa Monica Pier say a multimillion-dollar make-over 
would transform the area into a vibrant town square with parks, ponds and 
walkways. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics contend that the plan would allow RAND, which owns land next to the 
Civic Center, overly generous development rights that could lead to increased 
traffic congestion and air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment blueprint would not alter the city's Art Deco City Hall, 
county courthouse or Civic Auditorium but would add more than 1 million square 
feet of development, including a new police headquarters and a massive parking 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was hammered out after nearly five years of public hearings and 
enjoys the support of the often fractious City Council, which rarely agrees on 
development matters. But the plan has powerful opponents, including state Sen. 
Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who helped launch the initiative campaign that put 
the issue on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 In Long Beach, the winner of the mayoral runoff will take the helm of a city 
in search of a new identity. Once home to giant defense contractors, a thriving 
naval station and a population with homogeneous Midwestern roots, Long Beach 
has seen military cutbacks throw its economy into a tailspin at a time when 
immigration has created growing Latino and Asian enclaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Political observers say six-year Mayor Ernie Kell lost his reelection bid in 
the April primary because he was out of touch with the city's changing needs. 
Now, the pundits are watching to see which direction voters will go. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill is running as the City Hall outsider, untainted by any connection to 
elective politics but armed with an arsenal of connections from her 31 years at 
Long Beach City College. She has painted Grabinski as part of an aloof 
government that has failed to address the city's pressing woes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have to ask ourselves: 'Is our city better off than it was eight 
years ago?' " O'Neill said, referring to Grabinski's tenure on the council. "I 
think the answer is a resounding no." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Grabinski, who brushes aside suggestions that he is the insider candidate, 
describes himself as an "independent spirit" on the council and argues that his 
candidacy represents a threat to the city's elite. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am one of the merchants of change. I think the old guard sees me as a 
threat," he said. "(O'Neill) is more of an insider than I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Grabinski and his supporters also have focused on O'Neill's lack of government 
experience. They question whether a political novice can tame a massive 
bureaucracy that oversees a nearly $400 million budget and a city that is beset 
by racial strife and economic troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the kind of place that you walk into and just assume you can 
learn on the job," Grabinski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such criticisms, political observers rate O'Neill the favorite -- if 
only because voters are angry with incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill captured 23% of the vote in the April primary, winning big on the 
affluent east side that is home to the largest percentage of the city's 
registered voters. Grabinski garnered 21%, with the bulk of his support coming 
from the western and northern parts of the city that are home to middle-class 
homeowners and growing Latino and Cambodian immigrant communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, O'Neill has picked up key endorsements from the primary's third- 
and fourth-place finishers -- Belmont Shore businessman Frank Colonna and City 
Councilman Jeffrey A. Kellogg. 
</P>
<P>
 Political insiders say the endorsements could be one of the deciding factors 
in the race. "They are a symptom of the way the vote is likely to go," said 
Paul Schmidt, a political science professor at Cal State Long Beach. 
"Endorsements themselves don't change voters minds, but it certainly helps to 
have them." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Grabinski enjoys the support of the police officers union.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; MUSIC, DANCING, BAKLAVA ABOUND AT GREEK 
FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To a growing number of Ventura County residents, this weekend's Greek Festival 
in Camarillo has become their once-a-year chance to gorge on grilled lamb and 
baklava, and dance like Zorba. 
</P>
<P>
 To the Greet Orthodox parishioners of St. Demetrios, the annual festival caps 
months of work that brings in thousands of dollars to the 16-year-old church. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing at their booth with a tray of baklava and other luscious pastries, 
Stacy Hronos and Katherine Pappas said they baked perhaps as many as 30,000 of 
the traditional Greek treats. The pair said even with the help of about 20 
other parish volunteers they had to start baking and freezing the desserts in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 "They look simple, but that's a lot of dough," said Hronos, who learned to 
cook the baklava and galatoboureko from her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with desserts, the parishioners sell everything from Greek Orthodox 
religious icons to grilled lamb gyros as part of the fund-raiser for the church 
located in a former Air Force chapel at Camarillo Airport. The airport was once 
Oxnard Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
 After last year's event, the parish was able to finish paying off the mortgage 
for the church, said festival organizer Christo Pulos. This year, Pulos said 
some of the money raised would go toward renovating the icon-filled chapel. The 
rest will be sent to the Greek Orthodox archdiocese in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The festival) has become a central part of our year," Pulos said, standing 
in the church recreation room surrounded by dozens of parish volunteers working 
to prepare food for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulos expected 15,000 to 20,000 people to visit the two-day festival with a $1 
admission. Many come to enjoy The Helenic Sounds of Los Angeles band or learn 
Greek dancing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People come because we know how to show them a good time," he said. But watch 
out for the ouzo, he said. "It's as smooth as milk, but it can knock you on 
your keister." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival continues today from noon until 7 p.m. at St. Demetrios Greek 
Orthodox Church, 400 Skyway Drive, Camarillo. For more information, call 
482-1273. SCOTT HADLY

 Ventura County sheriff's deputies arrested three San Fernando Valley men about 
2:30 a.m. Saturday on suspicion of burglarizing cars in Oak Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies stopped the suspects' car after it ran a stop sign and noticed 
several car stereos and speakers strewn about the car, a Sheriff's Department 
spokesman said.Police had recently beefed up patrols in the area after several 
cars were broken into. Deputies also reported finding "burglary type tools" in 
the vehicle.  
</P>
<P>
 Arrested were Carlos Quintania, 18; William Rene Villegas, 28, and Jose Heber 
Cisneros, 26, all of North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The three were booked into the Ventura County Jail on burglary charges, a jail 
spokesman said. Bail was set at $10,000 for each of them. SCOTT HADLY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MEINERS OAKS; 1ST SERVICE HELD IN GROUP'S NEW TEMPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shortly before sundown Friday, members of the newly formed Jewish Community of 
the Oaks held their first Shabbat in the small church building that as of this 
week became their own temple. 
</P>
<P>
 Escrow on the abandoned Meiners Oaks chapel closed last week, culminating 
months of anticipation for the group of Ojai Valley Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we have something that is ours," said Karen Rubin, an organizer of the 
group. "Hopefully, that will bring about a whole new sense of community." 
</P>
<P>
 The group has held informal services in the nondescript meeting hall during 
the past few months, but Friday's Shabbat service -- or Jewish Sabbath -- 
marked the first time the loosely organized congregation has assembled in its 
own building. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would describe it as a meeting place for Jews of all sorts," said David 
Feigin, who has been involved in the purchase of the building and organization 
of K'hilat Ha'Aloneem, Hebrew for Community of the Oaks. "It's a place for us 
to make happen whatever we want to have happen, that means if we want to do 
services there, great, we'll do services," Feigin said recently. "It won't be 
branded, just a safe place." 
</P>
<P>
 The building, located at 619 W. El Roblar Drive in Meiners Oaks, has stood 
vacant since the Ojai Valley Church of Christ merged with another local 
congregation. Feigin, an Ojai Valley realtor, opened escrow on the chapel 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 About 160 people attended the first Shabbat at an informal service in March, 
Feigin said, and interest in the group has since grown to about 220 families. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's never been anything like this up here for Jewish people," Feigin 
said. "Our goal is to meet the needs of the community." TRACY WILSON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CRASH VICTIM IDENTIFIED AS RETIRED 
ENGINEER, 83

<P>
 An 83-year-old man who died after his car was broadsided by an armored truck 
just outside a Ventura cemetery has been identified by the Ventura County 
coroner's office as Howard Schaaf, a retired engineer from Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaaf was exiting Ivy Lawn Memorial Park on Valentine Road after visiting his 
wife's grave when he was struck by the truck operated by Armored Transport of 
Ventura, a Ventura Police Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaaf died instantly, according to Deputy Coroner Mitch Breese. The driver of 
the truck was traveling within the speed limit and not considered at fault, the 
police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The armored truck driver and the two guards who rode with him were uninjured 
in the incident, the police spokesman said. The three remained in the vehicle 
until another armored truck arrived to remove the money it had collected from 
banks and markets in Ventura. SCOTT HADLY

<P>
 A 14-year-old girl was critically injured Saturday morning after falling 65 
feet from lower Rose Valley Falls north of Ojai, a Fire Department spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, whose name was not released by authorities, had climbed up to a 
ledge at the lower falls about 8:30 a.m. She slipped on moss while taking in 
the view, said Ventura County Fire Capt. Bob Myers from Station 22 in Meiners 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers said the girl fell into a six-inch pool of water, striking several 
jagged rocks when she hit. She suffered cuts and scrapes to her head, internal 
injuries and possibly a broken leg, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The girl was taken by Sheriff's Department helicopter to the Ventura County 
Medical Center, where she is listed in critical but stable condition, a Medical 
Center spokeswoman said. SCOTT HADLY

WIFE SEEKS DIVORCE FROM EX-POLICE CHIEF GATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blaming irreconcilable differences after 24 years of marriage, the wife of 
former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates has filed for divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 Sima L. Gates filed divorce papers in Orange County Superior Court on May 5, 
four days before a federal judge dropped her husband from Rodney G. King's 
lawsuit seeking millions of dollars in damages for his 1991 beating by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Court records show that the couple have been living apart since February. Sima 
Gates lives in their San Clemente condominium. The former chief lives in 
Highland Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates retired two years ago after heavy criticism of his handling of the 1992 
riots.

CITY, BUSINESS LEADERS SEEK TO IMPROVE TIES; THOUSAND OAKS: COUNCIL APPLAUDS 
EFFORTS BY LOCAL GROUP SEEKING TO STREAMLINE GOVERNMENT AND WILL CONSIDER 
ADDITIONAL REFORMS.

 After nine months of work, a Thousand Oaks group formed to improve relations 
between local businesses and the city will present two plans to the City 
Council on Tuesday aimed at streamlining local government. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the council will vote on whether to ask the group of local business 
leaders to form a standing committee to pursue a long list of proposals aimed 
at converting Thousand Oaks into a more business-friendly city. 
</P>
<P>
 Already the group, called the Mayor's Business Roundtable, has had some 
success. The council recently approved a plan to streamline the permit process 
for people making minor additions to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The business leaders have proposed that the council revamp the permit process 
for business owners who wish to make property improvements. And they have asked 
the council to restructure the city's guidelines for businesses to improve 
accessibility for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 A report the group submitted to the council this week lists several other 
proposals it hopes the city will adopt -- plans the group believes will 
significantly affect the way the city deals with business. 
</P>
<P>
 As they approach Tuesday's meeting, members of the group are trumpeting their 
performance like a hit Broadway play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been amazing," Mayor Elois Zeanah said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Outstanding," said Harry Selvin, chairman of the round table. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bravo to the Mayor's Business Roundtable," said Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski. 
"It started as an experiment and it has now proven to us that dedicated 
citizens can get city government moving." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past nine months, the group has met weekly to brainstorm, debate and 
lay out plans to cut red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's proposals, round table members said, would be a step in that 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 One plan would limit the city's power to force business owners to make 
improvements to their property. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, when a business owner asks to make an improvement -- such as a 
landscaping change or adding space to an office -- the city requires the owner 
to make other, unrelated upgrades to the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, said round table member Francisco Behr, is that businesses are 
deterred from making improvements at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now people with aging properties are afraid to make upgrades because 
when they ask for the permits, they're going to be required to make all kinds 
of changes that they cannot afford," said Behr, a Thousand Oaks architect. 
</P>
<P>
 "This proposal prevents that," he said. "It allows for some flexibility." 
</P>
<P>
 The other item being forwarded Tuesday would change the city's building 
regulations regarding access for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is to end the confusion between our policy and the state and federal 
policies," Zeanah said. "This would require our policy to be consistent with 
the others." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the council will vote on whether to establish the business round 
table as a standing city committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the council approve that measure, the group will have a permanent spot 
in the government process and will become a fixture on the long list of mayoral 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, incoming Mayor Alex Fiore has said he looks forward to participating 
in the weekly round table discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, he sent a letter to the 20 regular participants outlining the goals 
he hopes the group will tackle in the upcoming year. 
</P>
<P>
 His objectives include passing an ordinance that encourages the city to buy 
from local businesses, charting a downtown redevelopment plan, and creating a 
small-business assistance program that could be run jointly by the city and the 
Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave them this list because I want to act as a catalyst," Fiore said. "I 
want to help them bring recommendations to the council and see us accomplish 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the round table said they welcomed Fiore's interest in the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alex has a fantastic range of experience and we look forward to hearing his 
thoughts and ideas," said Selvin, the round table chairman. "I know we will 
look closely at his suggestions." 
</P>
<P>
 Selvin said that in order to keep the round table from becoming politically 
influenced, Fiore will be asked to act only as a facilitator -- which is the 
same role Zeanah has played during the past nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that has proven to be the best way to go about it," Fiore said. "My 
job will be to help them bring issues to the attention of the council, and to 
make certain there is cooperation from (the city) staff." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time the round table was being formed, the main concern was that it 
could not act without being ensnared by the city's tangle of business and 
environmental interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Zukowski said, the round table has proven itself to be an impartial 
advisory body. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this group has demonstrated what can happen when you bring people 
together who are outside of the regular government process," Zukowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have developed for themselves a reputation of fairness and 
thoughtfulness that should help this city improve its standing with the 
business community," she said.

 Community service projects including fund-raisers for abused children helped 
35 Orange County Girl Scouts win the Gold Award, the highest honor in Girl 
Scouting. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Girl Scout Council of Orange County said 10% to 12% of 
the county's Scouts earn the award each year, compared to a national average of 
4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the local honorees was Anaheim resident Tami Eilenberger from Canyon 
High School, who collected clothing, organized a tutorial program and planned a 
holiday party for residents at Eli Home, a shelter for abused women and their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo resident Sara Fleishman of El Toro High School brought dogs to 
residents of local retirement centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback High School student Laurie Hargraves of Santa Ana put together a 
"Disability Awareness Week" for her classmates. One of the activities was a 
fair at which students could "try on" various disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine resident Dena Berezin of University High School organized a walkathon 
that gathered toy donations for Casita de San Jose, a home for abused children. 
</P>
<P>
 The other Orange County Girl Scouts receiving the Gold Award are: Allison 
Ayers, Alyssa Penmen, Kristin Rydberg and Lori Yamato of Anaheim; Elizabeth 
Dearborn of Costa Mesa; Lisa Jacobson and Erica Lewis of Cypress; Tricia Tanaka

GARDEN GROVE OKS $17,500 TOWARD THEME PARK STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council, acting as the Redevelopment Agency, has agreed to pay for 
half the cost of a study on the possibility of building a theme park in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members last week voted 4 to 1 to allocate $17,500 for the preliminary 
study, which will be conducted by U.S. Entertainment Centers Inc. and its 
design partner, Battaglia and Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine-based Battaglia and Associates have designed theme parks in the Far 
East, including one in Seoul, South Korea, which City Councilman Ho Chung 
visited this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Chung said he was impressed with the Seoul theme park, called Lotte World, 
which features a 350-store shopping mall and a 500-room hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 A theme park in Garden Grove, possibly anchored by an international trade and 
cultural center, would be a boost to the local economy, Chung said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Robert F. Dinsen opposed the proposal, saying the theme park could 
involve enormous costs that the city may not be able to afford. 
</P>
<P>
 But other council members said the study will help determine those costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, representatives of Battaglia and Associates approached the city 
with the idea of building a theme park that included a card club. But city 
officials have rejected the card club idea and continue to insist it is not 
acceptable. BERT ELJERA

SIMI VALLEY CITY COUNCIL TO SEEK NEW WAYS TO REDUCE POLLUTION; ENVIRONMENT: THE 
CITY IS CONCERNED THAT EFFORTS TO CLEAN ITS AIR ARE NOW LIMITED BY RESTRICTIVE 
COUNTY RULES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley is one of the most polluted cities in Ventura County, yet while 
most of the smog there comes from outside its borders, the city is locked into 
a restrictive set of county-dictated pollution-control rules. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday night, the City Council plans to review those rules, looking for any 
that could be modified and considering any measures that could further cut smog 
in Simi. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammered out by cities and the county's Air Pollution Control District, these 
rules govern everything from new housing developments and bus routes to bike 
paths and stoplights. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet much of the pollution is forced into Simi Valley's air from elsewhere by 
breezes from the ocean or Santa Ana winds. Then, on the smoggiest days, the 
pollution is trapped by the mountains edging the city, meteorologists say. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens in Simi Valley doesn't affect us at all," Mayor Greg Stratton 
said. "Our air's already bad when it comes from Oxnard. Our impact on our own 
air is really minimal. . . . The car's still the biggest problem." 
</P>
<P>
 That, Stratton said, is one of the most frustrating aspects of Simi Valley's 
smog. The city and the Air Pollution Control District have no direct control 
over vehicle exhaust -- the chief pollutant that residents of Simi Valley add 
to their own air. Vehicle exhaust standards are set by the state and federal 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can make a guy put in bike racks, but until you take away somebody's car, 
they're still going to drive it," Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the pollution-control rules governing Simi Valley were put in place in 
1991, and the city is complying with them, city planner Dulce Conde-Sierra 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the City Council also will be briefed on proposed rules being studied by 
the Air Pollution Control District, said Conde-Sierra, deputy director of 
special projects in the city's Department of Environmental Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposals include drafting a countywide plan for bicycle and pedestrian 
paths, basing vehicle registration fees on exhaust emissions, and requiring 
businesses with fewer than 50 employees to comply with smog-cutting measures 
now required of larger companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very conceptual thing," Conde-Sierra said of the existing and 
proposed rules the City Council will review Monday. "What we want to do is just 
bring the council up to speed on what is being discussed, what has been 
discussed before the APCD and tell them what's being proposed at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 City planners will return to the council in September with specific 
recommendations on which of the old rules should be changed and which of the 
new rules should be endorsed. 
</P>
<P>
 And Stratton said the individual cities in Ventura County will soon have a say 
in how the APCD rules are drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayors of the 10 cities are scheduled to meet June 21 in Camarillo to select 
five local representatives to sit on the district's board, helping to decide 
how to control pollution in Ventura County.

TEAM TRYING TO PICK UP TRAIL OF LOST CIVILIZATIONS; EXCAVATION: ARCHEOLOGISTS 
GET VOLUNTEER HELP AS THEY TRY TO UNEARTH SECRETS IN ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Retired police Lt. Doug Collisson always loved a good mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, deep in the Angeles National Forest, the dogged 49-year-old is on the 
trail of perhaps the biggest whodunit of his life -- with 4,000-year-old clues. 
</P>
<P>
 Collisson is part of a volunteer archeological crew, snooping for the secrets 
of these ancient woods. The archeological team is trying to reconstruct the 
past, much the way Collisson once did on the homicide beat in South Los 
Angeles. But this time, he and other history buffs are trying to solve 
mysteries of antiquity: 
</P>
<P>
 What Native American tribes lived and died in the San Gabriel Mountains? Did 
they head for the mountains only in the balmy days of spring, so that they 
could make tents out of the blooming yucca plants and grass mats and beat the 
wily squirrels to the pine nuts? Or at other times of the year as well? 
</P>
<P>
 What did they trade to get their precious obsidian, a type of volcanic glass 
from the eastern Sierra that they used for knives and projectile points? 
</P>
<P>
 "A good crime scene. That's what we've got here," said Collisson, who lives in 
the east San Gabriel Valley. "Some very small clues, but eventually the whole 
picture will come together." 
</P>
<P>
 The three-week excavation project, in the Arroyo Seco District, started May 9 
and ended May 26. There are no answers yet, but four professional archeologists 
who led the dig will study the excavated material, which includes arrowheads, 
grinding stones and charred animal bones, evidence of cooking. In a related 
project, seven volunteers and a paid consultant returned May 22 from a nine-day 
hike into the remote Sheep Mountain Wilderness, where they documented gold 
mining sites from the 1850s and early 1900s for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Consultants will prepare reports on both sites for forest officials, who will 
provide the information to researchers, develop plans to protect the sites and 
possibly develop interpretive displays with the artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the Angeles National Forest this year is participating in 
a nationwide U.S. Forest Service program called "Passport in Time," which 
started in 1989 as a way to encourage public involvement and get free labor. 
The program allows rangers to research historic sites for which they have had 
neither the money nor the staff to preserve and document. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest archeologist Michael McIntyre said the program provides a rare 
opportunity to examine sites. With only two archeologists for the 694,000-acre 
forest, there is little time to do much except note the existence of a site 
with historical potential, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The forest contains 400 sites that are recorded at UCLA's Archeological 
Information Center, 95% of which are unexplored. Instead, the sites are left to 
the vagaries of weather, looters and animals, said McIntyre, who was hired in 
1981 as the forest's first archeologist. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try not to call any attention to it," McIntyre said. "Leave it alone, 
record it and hope no one notices." 
</P>
<P>
 McIntyre shakes his head at the cost of neglect. Twenty years ago, for 
instance, after Forest Service rangers tried to shore up a river bank, the 
river changed course and washed away Native American rock art in San Gabriel 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Passport in Time projects allow the Forest Service to begin chipping 
away at its backlog of historical and archeological sites. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Native American project, the chance to chase history drew 31 
volunteers -- including residents of Idaho, Arizona and Texas -- to a hilly 
site crowded with Jeffrey Pine, sagebrush and wild rose. Some of the sunburned 
volunteers fell into their sleeping bags as early as 8 p.m., exhausted after a 
long day lugging dirt-filled buckets that turned their arms to stone and 
fighting off swarming gnats that dived into their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers included a certified public accountant who was born in West 
Germany, a yellow pages advertising representative who started the cold 
mornings with extra-strong coffee and a grandmother in a floppy straw hat -- 
people who usually don't get the chance to bite down on an excavated pea-sized 
chip to see if it is hard and clinks against the teeth, a test to help 
determine if it is bone material. 
</P>
<P>
 And on the 21-mile gold mine research hike, past the Bridge to Nowhere and 
through woods with no trails, volunteers lugged 75-pound backpacks up steep 
mountains, keeping their eyes open for black bears, mountain lions and 
rattlesnakes. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all in the name of history; it certainly can't be for the money. 
</P>
<P>
 The unpaid volunteers bring their own food and camping gear. Projects, which 
last from a week to several months, are listed in a nationally distributed 
catalogue that describes the site and any prerequisites for participation, such 
as age and hiking expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, 230 projects have been sponsored nationwide. Among them: a Coronado 
National Forest project in Arizona to excavate Old Camp Rucker, a small 
military post that sent out Indian scouts to search for Apaches; and a Nebraska 
National Forest project to record 6,000-year-old prehistoric sites in the Great 
Plains, where researchers have already uncovered a hearth and butchered bison 
bone. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, volunteers have made discoveries of their own. For instance, in 
North Dakota, volunteers who searched for Custer's 7th Calvary's trail to the 
Little Bighorn River unexpectedly stumbled across evidence of the army's camp 
sites -- a piece of history that might otherwise have been lost, said Kathleen 
Schamel, Passport in Time coordinator in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have these sites, we don't know what they are and we have to interpret 
them and find out how they fit into the grand scheme of our nation's history," 
Schamel said. 
</P>
<P>
 No federal money is earmarked for the Passport in Time project. Instead, 
officials from each participating national forest use funds from their cultural 
resources budget. For the Native American project, Angeles National Forest 
officials allocated about $23,000 to hire archeology firm C.A. Singer & 
Associates Inc. of Cambria and $15,000 for the mining expedition, led by 
paleontologist Steven W. Conkling of LSA Associates Inc., an Irvine-based 
environmental firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Angeles National Forest, archeological sites are usually discovered as 
part of a cursory investigation for environmental impact reports, which are 
state-required documents for construction projects such as roads and trails.  
</P>
<P>
 By law, archeological sites recorded at UCLA's local clearinghouse are secret 
-- disclosed only to researchers -- and exempt from the Freedom of Information 
Act. Some, however, are opened up after excavation for interpretive displays. 
In popular hiking areas, sites with archeological potential are closed off but 
unmarked, while sites in remote areas are simply left alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest Service officials learned about the one-acre Native American site 14 
years ago, by word of mouth. "People said, 'Oh yeah, as kids we used to come up 
here and collect artifacts,' " McIntyre said. 
</P>
<P>
 And, a few years ago on the site, McIntyre found a granite grinding stone, 
called a mono , and a flat milling stone, called a metate , both of which 
Native Americans used to grind grain into flour for cakes, gruel and bread. 
</P>
<P>
 In preparation for the excavation and preservation of the Native American 
site, forest officials last winter made permanent changes: altering the path of 
a trail to avoid the site and moving some camping and equestrian facilities.

EXHIBITS FOCUS ON L.A.'S IRANIAN COMMUNITY; CULTURE: UCLA SHOWS TRACE A 
POPULATION OF EXILES WHILE OFFERING GLIMPSES OF THE CITY'S DIVERSE YET INSULAR 
GROUP ENGAGING IN PLAY, PRAYER AND POLITICS. 
</P>

 Like almost everybody else whose roots are not in the deserts and mountains 
and sprawling cities of ancient Persia, Ron Kelley knew little about the 
Iranians of Los Angeles when he set out to portray this large, prosperous, 
fractured and insular group. 
</P>
<P>
 After five years of taking pictures at political demonstrations, nightclubs, 
testimonial dinners, religious services and upscale shopping venues, he found 
himself with mixed feelings about a community that has largely flourished 
despite the travails of exile. 
</P>
<P>
 Although moved by the warmth, passions, hospitality, grief, melancholy and 
sensuality that he saw in their culture, Kelley said he was put off by 
"conspicuous materialism, obsession with status and pretense." 
</P>
<P>
 These attitudes are reflected in more than 100 images that make up the core of 
"Irangeles: Iranians in Los Angeles," one of two upcoming exhibits at UCLA that 
offer a rare look at what is believed to be among the largest concentration of 
Iranians outside their home country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority are exiles, mostly self-imposed," said Mehdi Bozorgmehr, an 
Iranian-born UCLA sociologist who has been studying the community since 1985. 
"Because of that, they're much more oriented (than other immigrants) to the 
country of origin, like Cubans and their preoccupation with Cuba." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley's current photo exhibit at the Fowler Museum of Cultural History west 
of Royce Hall will run through Nov. 13. The pictures have been published as a 
book by the University of California Press, along with essays by several UCLA 
researchers and interviews conducted by Kelley, who trained as an 
anthropologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley's black-and-white photos document Iranian immigrants at play and prayer 
and practicing political activism in Los Angeles, where educational 
opportunities and good weather served as lures during the 1960s and 1970s. 
Immigration also increased for a time after the political turmoil that led to 
the ouster of Shah Reza Pahlavi in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 The second show, "Labyrinth of Exile," serves as a counterpoint to 
"Irangeles." It comprises the work of young immigrants who came of age in the 
United States and includes haunting multimedia images of women's hands, feet 
and chador-draped faces; passages of poetry silk-screened onto rocks, and other 
works. It is scheduled to run at the Fowler from June 25 to Sept. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Both shows speak to a community that is a mix of largely secular Muslims and 
smaller, more religious ethnic groups -- Jews, Armenian Christians, Bahais, 
Assyrians, Zoroastrians and Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
 Most bypassed the historical immigrant pattern of settling in slums and 
working their way out. Instead, these refugees have thronged to Beverly Hills 
-- where their children make up nearly a fourth of the students in the public 
schools -- Westwood, West Los Angeles and Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale, the Palos Verdes Peninsula and parts of the western San Fernando 
Valley also have sizable Iranian populations. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of people in Los Angeles County claiming Iranian ancestry totaled 
79,310 in 1990, according to the U.S. Census. Some in the community believe 
their numbers are much higher. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA is an appropriate venue for the exhibits. With several hundred members, 
the Iranian Student Group is one of the largest ethnic organizations on campus. 
Dozens of Iran-born scholars and researchers dot the faculty roster. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus sits at the northern end of Westwood Boulevard, whose southern 
reaches are lined by storefronts festooned with cursive Farsi script and draped 
with flags for the Iranian springtime New Year holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the existence of this commercial center and the prosperity of 
professionals and self-employed business people, there are no high-profile 
organizations that speak for the Iranian immigrants and no cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
 Religion -- or the lack of it -- has made for a splintered reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it comes to friendship, social ties, economic and political ties, the 
most important difference is between Muslims and the religious minorities," 
Bozorgmehr said. "These sub-communities are much more cohesive." 
</P>
<P>
 Iranians tend to mix with compatriots of common religious backgrounds, though 
Muslims who fled after the fall of the Shah of Iran in 1979 and the 
establishment of an Islamic republic lack the glue of religion to hold them 
together. Raised in the worldly decades of the Shah's westward-looking regime, 
most of them have little in common with more devout Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they were religious, they would have stayed back home," Bozorgmehr said. 
"The revolution uprooted the secular people, but a very strong sense of 
nationalism is there." 
</P>
<P>
 Culture clash, intergenerational conflict and differences over the role of 
women, together with a drop-off of immigration, are all factors that 
sociologists would expect to lead to a loss of identity among the Iranians. 
</P>
<P>
 But overall, many have yet to dissolve into the great American melting pot. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the characteristics -- educated, modern, professional -- you'd 
think they'd assimilate, but they haven't," Bozorgmehr said. "It's remarkable 
how ethnic this population is." 
</P>
<P>
 The two UCLA shows, arranged so that visitors will be able to stroll between 
the exhibitions, bear that out. 
</P>
<P>
 To make "Irangeles," Kelley spent much of five years getting to know the 
lifestyle of Iranians in exile. 
</P>
<P>
 He photographed so many discos and demonstrations that Iraj Gorgin, a 
Farsi-language TV personality, said Iranians who live a quieter life may be 
underrepresented. 
</P>
<P>
 Mainstream Iranians are not political activists and do not spend all their 
time in cabarets, Gorgin said. The photo exhibit and the accompanying book are 
"a good big step to introduce Iranians to American society," he said, "but they 
do not tell the complete story." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley replied that he never meant to catalogue the Iranian community. 
Instead, he said, he used the artistic techniques of "street photography" to 
express his own reactions to what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more I explored the community, the more I fell in love, the more I came 
to understand the . . . dilemma" of immigrants from a land with a history of 
foreign invasions, political repression and disillusionment, most recently with 
Western culture. "It's about suffering on a profound scale," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley and co-editor Jonathan Friedlander said they sought to make their 
points through an often startling juxtaposition of images. 
</P>
<P>
 One picture records a march through Westwood of women in modest Muslim 
headdresses, long dresses and pantsuits. One pushes a baby carriage, another 
carries a sign reading "God is the Greatest" and the third hefts a portrait of 
the Ayatollah Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
 It is matched with a scene from a "Persian Night" Halloween party at a West 
Hollywood disco, where girls in low-cut dresses smirk behind veils as they pose 
with a man in a Khomeini costume, complete with mask and turban. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans think of Iranians in terms of the Ayatollah, but here's someone, 
who had to flee because of the Ayatollah, making fun of it too," said Steven 
Gold, a Whittier College sociologist who also uses photography in his work. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the artists in the second show, "Labyrinth of Exile," while praising 
the photographs of the displaced older generation, said they felt left out of 
Kelley's photographic record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was missing from that depiction of Iranian culture in this country," said 
Taraneh Hemami, 34, who mixes old pictures of herself and her family with 
traditional motifs from carpet designs and Iranian architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we're not as easily recognized," said Hemami, who came to this country 
in 1978. "Maybe we (young people) blend in more." 
</P>
<P>
 Payam Farrahi, 27, who immigrated at the age of 10, said he consciously clings 
to "my awful accent" in order to stay in touch with his Iranian side. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrahi, whose verses are being silk-screened onto granite blocks for the 
show, makes his living as a chef at an Iranian-owned Italian restaurant in 
Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ron (Kelley) has captured a society that was defeated in the revolution and 
moved across the world, but is trying to preserve its illusions, its old ways 
of thinking," he said. "His camera has captured that decadence, and then you 
come into our exhibit. I'm not saying we're not decadent, but we're looking for 
new ways." 
</P>
<P>
 His English-language poem, "Reality," begins: "i am a child/of the thick 
atmosphere/and corrupt altitudes/of the violent paradise/of this mechanical 
century;/which the core of it/is not honour/but murder. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Other artists in the "Labyrinth" show include Ali Reza Dadgar, 32, who 
projects photographs onto aluminum, sheet metal, wood or paper, stapled 
together with nails, screws or bolts, "in a rough, abrupt way, because the 
truth of the process is important and I don't want to fake it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was living in Iran, I think I would have been way out in left field," 
said Dadgar, who came to the United States in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 The work of Shirin Neshat examines women's life in modern Iran, where the 
chador, or body veil, is required, yet women are sent to military service. 
</P>
<P>
 She adorns her photographs of faces, hands and feet with guns and poetry from 
the works of Taherah Saffarzadeh, who called for women to take part in the 
revolution along with their brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was one of those 'Irangeles' people," said Neshat, 37, who lives in New 
York and returns to Iran occasionally to visit her family. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of just living in memories is tragic," she said. "I can't bear it."

CRENSHAW HIGH TARDY POLICY GETS POOR GRADE FROM SOME; EDUCATION: SEVERAL 
PARENTS SAY THEIR CHILDREN ARE BEING PUNISHED UNFAIRLY. SCHOOL OFFICIALS SAY 
THE PROCEDURES ARE IN KEEPING WITH DISTRICT RULES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two dozen parents are challenging a stringent tardy policy at Crenshaw High 
School, saying students who are already struggling academically are being 
punished unfairly and ineffectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacinto Rhines, a 54-year-old writer and youth lecturer, is leading the effort 
to change the policy, under which students may be locked out of class and sent 
to a tardy room for counseling. The group, Parents for Power, says children 
wind up with staggering numbers of tardies and absences, are made to pick up 
trash when they should be learning, and sometimes are incorrectly marked absent 
by teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can my child get an education like this?" said Rhines, waving a copy of 
three report cards for his child that show 66 tardies and absences. His 
14-year-old daughter, Megan, is a special education student who recently 
transferred to Crenshaw from a Compton school. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rhines: "They're making no exceptions for a child who had to adjust to 
six classes a day versus one. They're practicing miseducation." 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Yvonne Noble said that while there are "bunches and bunches" of 
students with serious tardy problems, none are treated unfairly or deliberately 
marked absent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tardies are a major problem, but Mr. Rhines' accusations just aren't true," 
she said. "The fact is, his daughter has been absent and he won't accept that." 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw assistant principal Yolanda Anderson said the school routinely keeps 
students out of class who are tardy for first period, but not other periods. 
The dean's office contacts parents when students accumulate five tardies and 
tries to resolve the problem, she said. Although tardies and absences do not 
automatically affect grades, classroom performance is usually affected by 
inconsistent attendance, she said. But Anderson stressed that students are not 
marked absent when they are merely tardy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the greatest problem with first-period tardies, so we crack down on 
that," said Anderson, who said that the detained students receive counseling. 
She added that the policy was adopted by the school's shared decision-making 
council a year ago, and has resulted in far fewer tardies. Figures were not 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, Rhines enlisted the help of attorney Phillip Higgins to 
prepare a lawsuit against the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The absences are just not being properly monitored," said Higgins. "Students 
are doing things like picking up trash that are not specific to education. And 
black kids are disproportionately suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 Rhines and the other parents, all African American, say that while they 
understand the need for discipline, their children are the ones who can least 
afford to stay out of class. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son is trying to bring up his work, bring in current events and things, 
but his teacher says he's going to fail anyway because of absences," said Mae 
Dean Easter, whose 15-year-old son Eli Rhodes has been credited with 124 
absences this year, though she insists he has been in school and has been 
marked absent when he was actually tardy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked to people at the school," she said. "I've sent notes about a few 
absences he had because of deaths in the family. But they say if he's marked 
absent he's marked absent, and that's it."  
</P>
<P>
 Richard Browning, director of the senior high schools division for Los Angeles 
Unified School District, says that tardy policies are made at each school by 
the decision-making council, comprised of school personnel, parents and 
community leaders. But he said that students who are tardy should not be be 
marked absent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main idea is to counsel students and then send them back to class," said 
Browning. "And those are mostly kids who are five to 10 minutes late, who are 
disruptive to teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 Rhines and other parents say that they were not alerted to the problem early 
enough. Last month Rhines met with Noble about the tardy issue, complaining 
that his daughter was routinely made to collect trash. 
</P>
<P>
 "First we would pick up trash with the plastic bags they gave us, and then we 
got a note to go back to class," said Megan, who is staying home from Crenshaw 
High until the school changes its policy. "But by then, class was almost over." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said tardy students assigned to trash-collecting do so for about 15 
minutes, then are sent back to class. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhines said that while seeking out other parents with his concerns, he found 
that many had been aware their children were having problems, but were at a 
loss how to address it. "A lot of times parents are ignorant of what they can 
do, or are just scared to get involved," said Rhines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't really know the impact of all this until I met Jacinto," said Willie 
Mae Bradley, who said she only found out last week that her granddaughter 
Tanicha may not graduate because of absences she believes are tardy-related. 
"For too long, people have just been going along with the program."

CANDIDATES PULL OUT THE STOPS IN RACES FOR 2 ASSEMBLY SEATS; POLITICS: 
INCUMBENTS FACE LITTLE OPPOSITION IN LOCAL RACES. BUT CAMPAIGNING IS LIVELY FOR 
OPEN SEATS IN THE 45TH AND 47TH DISTRICTS. 
</P>

<P>
 A heated battle between two front-runners in a Northeast Assembly district and 
a lively race with 11 contestants in a Southwest Assembly district will 
highlight balloting in Central Los Angeles for congressional and legislative 
seats in Tuesday's primary. 
</P>
<P>
 In most area races, incumbents are facing little or no opposition. But the two 
open Assembly seats have sparked spirited races. Also, a battle for a vacant 
seat in the 22nd state Senate District pits a veteran legislator against a 
longtime legislative aide making her first run for public office. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 45th Assembly District, Democrats Bill Mabie and Antonio Villaraigosa 
are locked in a bitter contest to fill a seat being vacated by Richard Polanco 
(D-Los Angeles), who is running for the open Senate seat. Both Mabie and 
Villaraigosa, vowing to focus on the issues, are charging that the other is 
running a dirty campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The district stretches from Highland Park to Boyle Heights, including Mount 
Washington, Silver Lake, Echo Park and parts of Hollywood. Latinos make up 63% 
of the district's 370,000 residents but only 36% of its 83,311 registered 
voters. Democrats make up 62% of the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie, 32, who is Polanco's chief of staff, is touting his community work and 
knowledge of the legislative process. Villaraigosa, 41, who was born and raised 
in the area, is stressing his 25 years of community work ranging from union 
activism to voter registration. Both were confident that they would come out on 
top. 
</P>
<P>
 "The response has been very positive," said Mabie, who was raised in the 
eastern San Gabriel Valley and moved to the area about five years ago. "I feel 
like we reached an incredible number of voters." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we worked really hard," said Villaraigosa, whose campaign has 
attracted dozens of area activists. "I feel good about our prospects." 
</P>
<P>
 According to recent campaign statements, Villaraigosa had raised $206,456, and 
Mabie had collected $115,198. 
</P>
<P>
 Villaraigosa has accused Mabie and Polanco of maliciously spreading rumors 
that he was arrested in 1977 for a felony assault.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police records recently obtained by the Times show that 
Villaraigosa was initially arrested on a felony charge in the case. But he was 
tried on a misdemeanor assault charge and was not convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Villaraigosa says the case stemmed from an attack on his mother by a man 
during a "big melee" at a local restaurant. "What is so despicable is that they 
would drag my dead mother into this," Villaraigosa said. "These are tactics of 
a desperate, floundering campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie and Polanco deny that they have sought to taint Villaraigosa's 
reputation. "I'm running a good, clean campaign," said Mabie, who added that 
Villaraigosa is trying to ruin his reputation by saying he is behind the 
rumors. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie, however, says he believes that Villaraigosa's arrest is a legitimate 
campaign issue. "I think it does reflect on his character," Mabie said. 
</P>
<P>
 The election also has taken on racial overtones, with some Latino politicians 
upset that Polanco is endorsing Mabie, who is white, for a seat that has been 
held by Latinos since 1972. But both candidates and many district voters say 
that ethnicity is not an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates are Democrats Spencer Burton, a businessman; teacher Gonzalo 
Molina and businessman Brian Quintana. Republican Robert K. Jung, an engineer, 
is unopposed for his party's nomination, as is Libertarian Pam Probst, a 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 47th Assembly District, 11 candidates are seeking to replace 
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles), who is running for secretary of 
state. The district stretches from Mid-City through Baldwin Hills and Ladera 
Heights. It was drawn to favor the election of an African American, and all but 
two of the candidates are black. African Americans comprise 40% of the 
residents in the district, where the electorate is 75% Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Five Democrats have significant money, endorsements or grass-roots support. 
They are attorneys Geoff Gibbs and Kevin Murray, congressional aide Ed Johnson, 
community activist Valerie Lynne Shaw and teacher and union activist Jimmie 
Woods Gray. The other Democratic contenders are attorney Marsha F. Kimble, 
writer Neil Liss, businessman Leslie Roberson and Rudolph Valentino Thompson. 
The Republicans are businessman Jonathan Leonard and attorney Kathleen Lee 
Brundo. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a longtime aide to Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), won the 
endorsement of the state Democratic Party at its convention last month. Murray 
is backed by his father, veteran Assemblyman Willard W. Murray Jr. 
(D-Paramount) and Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), among 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 In the campaign for another open seat, former legislative aide Yolanda 
Gonzalez is waging a battle against a well-financed Polanco in the 22nd Senate 
District. Polanco has raised more than $172,949; Gonzalez said she has raised 
about $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The district stretches from Highland Park through Echo Park and Silver Lake to 
South-Central, including portions of the Eastside, Mid-City and Hollywood. The 
vacant seat resulted when the district was reconfigured after court-ordered 
reapportionment in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the area includes Polanco's current Assembly district, which he has 
represented since 1986.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think that, given my track record, I will be given an opportunity to move 
on to the Senate," Polanco said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gonzalez accuses Polanco of flip-flopping on important issues such as 
immigration and a failed effort to build a prison on the Eastside.  
</P>
<P>
 "The community knows his voting record," Gonzalez said. "I'm going to win the 
election because the people want change." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez has worked in the state Senate for 20 years. Nine of those years were 
with former Eastside Sen. Alex P. Garcia. Before running for the Senate, 
Gonzalez was the director of Hispanic Affairs and Minority Outreach in the Los 
Angeles office of Sen. David A. Roberti. (D-Van Nuys). 
</P>
<P>

DYING HIS HERO'S DEATH; HE'S PLAYED A LOVER ON 'SANTA BARBARA' AND A LAWYER ON 
'L.A. LAW.' BUT ALL HIS LIFE, A MARTINEZ HAS WANTED TO PLAY THE LEGENDARY 
CALIFORNIA BANDIT TIBURCIO VASQUEZ.; IN LUIS VALDEZ'S NEW PLAY WITH MUSIC 
'BANDIDO!' HE GETS HIS BIG CHANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA ISENBERG, Barbara Isenberg is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Martinez vividly remembers childhood trips north from Los Angeles. In the 
car, the future actor's grandmother would tell tales of Tiburcio Vasquez, the 
notorious bandido who frequented those parts back in the 1850s. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes Martinez's father would stop the car at Vasquez Rocks near Agua 
Dulce, then pull out his 8-millimeter movie camera. When he and his brothers 
saw the camera pointing at them, Martinez recalls, "we would shoot each other 
immediately, then spend the next three minutes dying." 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Thursday, Martinez will re-create Vasquez's demise eight times a 
week on the Mark Taper Forum stage. In "Bandido!," Luis Valdez's new play with 
music, the television and movie heartthrob stars as the fabled Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
 Characterized as a villain, hero, revolutionary or avenger -- or, sometimes, 
all of those -- Vasquez was reportedly the last man to be publicly hanged in 
California. Said to have been on the run for 20 of his 39 years, he was among 
the first people sent to San Quentin and one of the first to break out. He was 
finally captured in the area now known as Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing Vasquez offers 45-year-old Martinez another chance to take on a 
romantic Latino role. It was, after all, his years as sexy-but-sensitive police 
detective Cruz Castillo on NBC's long-running soap opera "Santa Barbara" that 
sent him careening off to TV stardom. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Bandido!' sounds like it was pristinely made for A," says actress Sheila 
Kelley, who played Martinez's love interest on "L.A. Law" and is paired with 
him again in USA Network's film "Deconstructing Sarah" later this month. "He's 
completely charming and dangerous and gentle, all at once." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was also raised in an environment where Vasquez was legendary. 
"Tiburcio continues to be a heroic figure in the Mexican community," Martinez 
says. "When I was younger, I thought that he was like Robin Hood; he was a 
robber at a time when his culture was being trashed, and you could sort of 
understand it. And having studied it now, it becomes apparent to me that he was 
caught in a situation from which there was no graceful escape." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez was descended from the founders of San Francisco, and both his parents 
came from landed families. "He was charismatic and smart," Martinez explains, 
"and he had a reasonable expectation as a boy that he would have a wonderful 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then all of a sudden, boom, gold is discovered and in one year, the 
population swells by 1,000%, and it's all people from an alien culture who 
quickly overwhelm everything. There is no more community, everything starts 
coming apart, and there was a great deal of racial hatred and mistrust." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez says that he's seen aspects of that historic racism in ways that hit 
home. For example, when the actor reviewed title papers for the Malibu land on 
which he and his wife, Leslie, built their house, he found a deed "from maybe 
80 years ago when a condition for owning that piece of land was that you agreed 
you would not sell it to a Mexican or a 'Negro.' I forget the exact words, but 
they specified you could only sell it to white people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Human beings are always trying to carve out their own turf, and we see the 
depth of ethnic hatred played out all over the globe right now. Look at Bosnia, 
Rwanda, South Africa -- displacement has effects that don't go away. And I 
don't think it's gone away here. When Gov. Wilson cites Mexican immigration as 
a key problem afflicting California, I wonder if he remembers that the Mexicans 
were here first." 
</P>
<P>
 That's how playwright Valdez sees it as well. Vasquez's family history 
parallels the development of this country, the playwright told reporters at a 
recent press conference for "Bandido!": "His evolution as a bandido is the 
Chicano evolution. We didn't just get here yesterday. We founded the state." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez first sketched his scenario for "Bandido!" on a paper napkin for Taper 
Artistic Director Gordon Davidson nearly two decades ago. He did it while here 
working with the Taper on the world premiere of "Zoot Suit," his groundbreaking 
1978 play with music about Chicanos and racism in '40s Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Bandido!" Valdez has dramatized a historical figure who was already pretty 
dramatic himself. As Valdez explains, bandit Vasquez even sold photographs of 
himself printed up like baseball cards, with a flip side listing the high 
points of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 It certainly doesn't hurt that Martinez is also handsome. Valdez explains that 
Vasquez was famous not just for his professional exploits but for his 
womanizing. His weakness for women, says the playwright, was Vasquez's tragic 
flaw; he was captured after he was turned in by a fellow gang member whose wife 
had become Vasquez's lover. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez did not die quickly on the gallows. It took him 14 minutes after his 
neck broke, and Valdez built "Bandido!" around what might have transpired in 
Vasquez's mind during that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Characters spring from Vasquez's flashbacks and nightmares, even emerging from 
coffins to talk, sing or dance. Martinez, who has grown a beard and mustache to 
play Vasquez, is rarely offstage for long. 
</P>
<P>
 The actor also sings all or part of four songs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big challenge," Valdez says. "He has to handle tons of words, and the 
play is written in a style that requires command of not just English but 
Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
 The playwright says he put Martinez's name "on a short list of actors who 
could deliver Vasquez. I was very happy he accepted the role and equally happy 
to see he was as good an actor onstage as in film and TV, which isn't always 
the case. Some actors can't make the leap. But he trained in theater. It is a 
natural return for him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez made his professional singing debut at 12 in a talent contest at 
Hollywood Bowl. Wearing a burgundy satin Harry Belafonte-style shirt and black 
pants, he sang "Kingston Market" well enough to win a local TV appearance 
(where he played the piano and sang) and a Polaroid camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Born and raised in Los Angeles, the oldest of six children, A was the third 
Adolpho Martinez. From assorted nicknames -- among them, "little a, "A-frame" 
and "model A" -- came A, no period. He went to Verdugo Hills High in Tujunga 
(where, he notes, two scenes in "Bandido!" occur), then studied theater at 
UCLA. He worked in Equity Waiver theater and played in rock 'n' roll bands. 
</P>
<P>
 He played rhythm guitar and sang in his high school surf band, the Makahas 
(named for a beach in Hawaii), which he says profited from "the novelty (that) 
I was a Mexican fronting a surf band." While at UCLA and after, he played piano 
for a band called Tujunga. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time Martinez dropped out of UCLA in 1970, he'd already started 
working in movies. He calls the 1972 film "The Cowboys," directed by Mark 
Rydell and starring John Wayne, "the linchpin for my career as an actor. . . . 
All of a sudden, I had a profile and I started to get offers for work. It 
really gave me momentum for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 He played a slew of bad guys -- pimps, dope dealers and assassins -- and 
occasionally a victim. He also played young Chicano radicals, which was what 
first brought him to Valdez's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the young Chicano street guy who was in the wrong place at the wrong 
time, and I seemed to be guilty of a crime," Martinez summarizes, wryly tossing 
off a typical story line from that period. "But somehow the hero of the show 
could sense that I had a good heart, then prove that it was circumstantial 
evidence and I was innocent. Occasionally I played the friend of the important 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, he played Juan Seguin, the first Latino mayor of San Antonio, for 
PBS' "American Playhouse," and, he says, "it was a watershed event for me. I 
got to actually demonstrate my heart for the first time. And it also was a 
chance to come together with the community of Chicano actors who normally don't 
get to work together." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez seems keenly aware that being Latino both held him back and propelled 
him forward: 
</P>
<P>
 "I could not complain in those days, because I was working, and I felt that my 
ethnicity was a benefit to me. I came on the scene with some training at the 
right time." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1984, came "Santa Barbara." He almost didn't take the job, he 
recalls. There he was, hoping to do more film than TV, when his agent was 
pushing him to audition for not just television, but daytime television. Three 
times he said no. But on the fourth call, he says, he went. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty deep into my career by then," the actor recalls. "You start 
thinking, 'Maybe I'm about to run out of gas here.' You start getting tired of 
playing these creeps, and you start doing it less well as you get tired of it." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a smart decision. Cruz Castillo became key to "Santa Barbara's" story 
line, and Martinez emerged as a daytime-TV star. He and Marcy Walker, who 
played his girlfriend and, eventually, wife Eden Capwell, were among soapdom's 
best-known and most popular couples. 
</P>
<P>
 At New World Entertainment, which produced and still distributes the show, a 
spokesman says hundreds of requests come in each week from all over the world 
asking for autographed photos of Martinez and Walker. The show went off the air 
in the United States last year after eight seasons, but it is still seen in 
more than 40 countries.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who was recently voted Germany's most popular daytime-TV actor, has 
a theory about that popularity: "I think Cruz translates all over the world, 
because he's the ethnic guy from the poor side of the tracks who won the heart 
of the American princess." 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Barbara" received an IMAGEN award in 1989 for Castillo, heralded as 
"the only major Hispanic character in daytime TV." Martinez was reportedly also 
the first Latino to be nominated for an Emmy as lead actor in daytime drama, 
and he won the Emmy in 1990 after several nominations. 
</P>
<P>
 He left "Santa Barbara" in 1992 to become a regular for two seasons on "L.A. 
Law." He had done a guest appearance on the show previously, playing a doomed 
Death Row inmate for the show's 1990 season finale. As Daniel Morales, he 
played a litigator who brings his 7-month-old daughter to work and later 
romances legal secretary Gwen Taylor (Sheila Kelley). 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez teams again with Kelley as lover-cum-blackmailer Kenny in USA 
Network's "Deconstructing Sarah," a world premiere movie set for June 16. And 
expect ed sometime in early fall is New World's psychological thriller "One 
Night Stand," in which he co-stars with Ally Sheedy.  
</P>
<P>
 In "One Night Stand," which marks the directorial debut of actress Talia 
Shire, Martinez plays a stranger whom Sheedy meets in a club, and who may or 
may not have killed his wife. Shire says she and Sheedy "thought A would be 
perfect in this role, because (his character) is an unknown. His identify is up 
for grabs. You have to have an artful actor who can be sexual and menacing and 
mysterious." 
</P>
<P>
 A leading man now, Martinez acknowledges that opportunities "for people like 
me, of this particular ethnic persuasion, to play leading roles have been 
slowly improving. Eddie Olmos obviously pushed things forward and really opened 
up a huge door. Before him, Anthony Quinn, Ricardo Montalban -- all the way 
back to Gilbert Roland -- there have been people carrying that line. 
</P>
<P>
 "The degree to which Andy Garcia has broken through is pretty much 
unprecedented. It's really important to the Latino community, acting and 
otherwise, that the development of stars occurs. Then it's viable from a 
business point of view for our stories to be told. That's the way this game 
works." 
</P>
<P>
 He seems surprised by a question about whether he'd go on with "Bandido!" 
should it wind up on Broadway as "Zoot Suit" did. He doesn't know, he says; it 
never even came up. Nor does he have a contract, he says, should "Bandido!" 
also follow "Zoot Suit" to become a film. "It's kind of a be-here-now 
situation," he says of the role, "(as in) Baba Ram Dass'advice all those years 
ago to us '60s types."

 The Southern California Interfaith Hunger Coalition will host an informational 
meeting Wednesday to increase participation in the Summer Food Service Program 
for Children. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, 1.6 million children participate in the school lunch 
program.But last year only 137,525 children participated in the summer meal 
program, according to the group. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, funded through the Department of Agriculture, is designed to fill 
the gap in meals children from low-income families may experience when they are 
not attending school. The program is for children under 18 and targeted for 
areas where 50% of students get a free or reduced-price lunch during the school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, which begins at 10 a.m. at the Second Baptist Church, 2412 
Griffith Ave., will offer information on program sites and hours and details 
about the program. The coalition's Child Nutrition Hotline will also be 
promoted. The number is (800) EAT-N-GRO.

SOAKING UP THE LOCAL COLOR; WILLIAM EGGLESTON BROUGHT COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY INTO 
THE ART WORLD. NOW HE BRINGS HIS EYE FOR UNLIKELY BEAUTY TO L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA, Kristine McKenna writes about art and other subjects for 
The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People who know about such things pretty much agree that William Eggleston was 
the first artist to confer legitimacy on color photography, and that he 
continues to be among its most brilliant practitioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that, Eggleston's critically acclaimed art has been all but upstaged 
by his personal life; when dispatched to write about the 54-year-old artist, 
journalists can't resist the impulse to shift the focus from his art to the man 
himself -- and this is understandable. Characters as extravagantly flamboyant 
as Eggleston don't come down the pike too often. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving in Los Angeles from his home in Memphis, Tenn., to shoot a series of 
pictures of Hollywood Boulevard for the New York literary quarterly Grand 
Street, he gets off the plane dressed in hunting boots, khaki pants, an 
impeccable white shirt and a bow tie and toting a briefcase full of cameras. A 
descendant of the planter aristocracy of the Mississippi Delta, Eggleston is a 
dandy, a gentleman of the old school, a connoisseur of tobacco, music, art, 
firearms, tailors and cobblers. 
</P>
<P>
 He's also a notorious rogue with a reputation for outrageous behavior, 
substance abuse and complicated romantic liaisons that seem to accompany his 
art everywhere it's shown. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is unfortunate, as Eggleston's achievement as an artist is considerable. 
His official debut was in 1976 with a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern 
Art. As the first significant show of color photography in a major art museum, 
the wildly controversial exhibition was greeted with catcalls at the time (the 
New York Times dismissed it as "the most hated show of the year"), but today it 
is credited with ushering photography into a whole new era. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no less an authority than America's great poet of black-and-white 
photography, Walker Evans, had decreed that "color photography is vulgar," 
Eggleston made that belief old hat and introduced a new approach to photography 
revolving around a remarkably confident naturalism. As prolific as he is 
original, Eggleston is a staggeringly productive artist whose body of work 
numbers well upward of 50,000 images, who has published four books and 10 
limited-edition portfolios and who has exhibited around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to photograph democratically," Eggleston says of his work, by which he 
means that he considers everything worthy of his attention. This has led to 
singular pictures of a light bulb, a ditch, a Sunday dinner, a patch of peeling 
paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Marked by an odd, abrupt approach to cropping, a curious attention to floors 
and ceilings, super-saturated colors and a penchant for compositions in which 
the action is along the borders and the center is empty, Eggleston's work 
places the familiar and the commonplace on equal footing with the rare and 
refined. Wide open to life in all its permutations, he refrains from organizing 
the things of the world into the hierarchy of value we normally ascribe to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Eggleston's first body of work to garner attention focused on his 
immediate environs in the South, he's often described as a Southern 
photographer, but that tag falls far short of the mark. He has, in fact, 
photographed locations around the world, been the set photographer on several 
films ("True Stories" and "Annie," to name two) and made videos. That most 
people are unaware of this may be a result of the fact that Eggleston has 
always treated his career with marked indifference. Recently signed to the 
prestigious Robert Miller Gallery in New York, he had a well-received show 
there last fall, but he has no gallery representation in Los Angeles, nor does 
he seem remotely concerned about such things. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spending a day with Eggleston is a highly entertaining bit of business. A 
soft-spoken man who talks about himself with uncommon candor, Eggleston 
solemnly informs that "I have a bad problem with alcohol" five minutes into an 
interview in his Hollywood hotel room. Seemingly unafflicted with feelings of 
remorse or judgment, he simply reports the facts as he sees them in a slow 
Southern drawl. In the habit of inviting virtual strangers to come along to 
wherever he happens to be going next, he is equally generous with his work, 
much of which he has given away. 
</P>
<P>
 Eggleston has dozens of friends in Los Angeles, but when a visitor inquires as 
to whether there is anything he hopes to do while he's here, he politely 
replies, "Not particularly." 
</P>
<P>
 When it is suggested later over lunch at Musso & Frank that perhaps he'd like 
to stroll down Hollywood Boulevard, a pained expression flickers across his 
face and he asks, "How far were you thinking?" 
</P>
<P>
 A man who proudly claims that he's never done a minute of exercise in his 
life, Eggleston was obviously born to spend endless hours planted in a chair, 
lighting one cigarette after the next and nudging along rambling chats about 
everything under the sun. He has a fascinating conversational style too; you 
could drive a truck through the pauses between words when he speaks, and he's 
prone to lapsing into protracted periods of stony silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Eggleston was born in Memphis in 1939, the eldest of three children, and grew 
up on a cotton farm in Sumner, Miss., a small town two hours south of Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you could say my childhood was idyllic," he recalls. "The 
sharecropping system was still in force, and we were the privileged class. My 
parents had a great respect for art, and two of the first things given to me as 
a child by my mother, who was a brilliant woman, were books on Rouault and De 
Chirico. My parents always encouraged my interest in art, even though they 
thought a career as an artist was crazy. They figured I could never make a 
living at it." 
</P>
<P>
 The reluctance to push Eggleston into a career in the visual arts was partly 
due to the fact that he was a musical prodigy as a child. A self-taught pianist 
capable of fluid improvisations on a classical repertoire, Eggleston continues 
to be as devoted to music as he is to photography. (He is also a gifted 
audiophile who builds his own stereo speakers.) 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was growing up it was thought I'd be a concert pianist because I could 
play anything by ear, but I never did take up the discipline," he says. "A 
musician has to give his entire life to his work, and I wasn't prepared to do 
that. I've continued to work on music throughout my life though, and the only 
reason I've never done anything public with it is because I have enough on my 
hands trying to get people to understand my photographs." (Eggleston is, in 
fact, preparing to release a CD of some of his compositions later this year.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A t this point the interview is interrupted by a phone call from a friend in 
Memphis, calling to inform him that that day's local paper includes a story 
about a friend of Eggleston's who is about to sue him. Eggleston is highly 
amused by news of the lawsuit, which revolves around some missing photographs 
that he says are in the possession of his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish them luck getting those pictures from Rosa," says Eggleston, who by 
his count has been in jail maybe a dozen times for assorted misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidentally or not, the day before coming to Los Angeles he had been in 
Mississippi at a trial involving rightful ownership of a car. Laws -- state, 
federal or any other kind you can think of -- don't seem to make much of an 
impression on him, and this attitude takes on a comical edge in Eggleston, who 
is in all other ways a well-bred aristocrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to his story, Eggleston talks a bit about his career as a student, 
which was, as might be expected, rather rocky. Sent at age 15 to an austere 
private school where he was miserable, he went on to brief stints at two 
Southern universities, then wound up spending five years at the University of 
Mississippi in Oxford. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was studying painting, and the painter I liked the most during that period 
was Franz Kline -- who works in black and white," he says with a laugh. "I also 
liked De Kooning and Pollock. Abstract Expressionism was the dominant thing 
when I was coming of age as an artist, and I went to New York and looked at a 
lot of that stuff. I was painting abstractions myself at the time, and although 
most people don't know this, I've never stopped painting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never got a degree," he adds, "because I couldn't see any sense in taking 
tests. I didn't mind going to classes, but taking a test? For whom? And what 
would I do with a damn degree anyway? Because I refused to take tests I had to 
talk the dean into letting me back into school every year, and that was hard 
because they didn't think I was particularly talented. At the time I was doing 
the groundwork for photography and photography was barely even taught then, 
much less considered an art form." 
</P>
<P>
 When one comments that his rebellious streak obviously surfaced fairly early 
on, Eggleston looks surprised and demurely insists: "I never been that wild." 
</P>
<P>
 Before heading off to college, Eggleston met his wife, Rosa Dosset, the 
daughter of a family that owned thousands of acres in the delta. He was 17 and 
she was 13 when they met, and they've been together, more or less, ever since. 
The mother of Eggleston's three grown children -- Bill Jr., Winston and Andra 
-- Rosa accepted long ago that her husband would always have other women in his 
life. Eggleston himself is so open and cheerfully unapologetic about his 
unorthodox lifestyle that he almost makes it seem normal. 
</P>
<P>
 Eggleston had already begun to toy with photography by the time he met Rosa, 
but he had yet to realize its full potential as a creative vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was 10 I got a Brownie camera and took some pictures of my dog, but 
they weren't very good and I was completely disenchanted with the idea of 
taking pictures," he recalls. "I continued to hate it until the late '50s, when 
a friend in boarding school made me buy a camera, and then I began to get it. 
Then I saw a copy of Cartier-Bresson's book 'The Decisive Moment,' and I really 
got excited about taking pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Working in black and white, Eggleston polished his technical skills throughout 
the early '60s, taking pictures clearly indebted to Cartier-Bresson. In the 
late '60s, however, a new idea began to coalesce in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see many movies, but there were a few films where the color was used 
brilliantly and they made a big impression on me -- Alfred Hitchcock's 'North 
by Northwest,' and 'Bonnie and Clyde,' are the two I'm thinking of in 
particular," he says. "Something clicked in me when I saw those films -- maybe 
it was just one minute out of the whole movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the same period that I was thinking about those films, I had a friend 
who had a job working nights at a photography lab where they processed 
snapshots and I'd go visit him because we were both night owls," he continues. 
"I started looking at these pictures coming out -- they'd come out in a long 
ribbon -- and though most of them were accidents, some of them were absolutely 
beautiful, and I started spending all night looking at this ribbon of pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was particularly struck by a picture of a guy who worked for a grocery 
store, pushing a cart out in the late-afternoon sun -- that one really stuck in 
my mind. I started daydreaming about taking a particular kind of picture, 
because I figured if amateurs working with cheap cameras could do this, I could 
use good cameras and really come up with something. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd already become proficient in black and white; I was a good technician, 
and I had a natural talent for organizing colors -- not putting all the reds in 
one corner, for instance. That was probably because I'd studied painting -- 
essentially what I was doing was applying intelligent painting theory to color 
photography." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, Eggleston showed his black-and-white work to John Szarkowski, then 
the director of the department of photography at the Museum of Modern Art, and 
succeeded in selling one print to the museum. When he returned two years later 
with his color work, however, he got a lot more from Szarkowski, who began a 
five-year struggle to persuade MOMA to mount an in-depth exhibition of the 
artist's work. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973 while teaching photography at Harvard, Eggleston adopted a method 
usually used only in advertising to print his photographs, which invested the 
work with intensely saturated color. This quality of color has come to be the 
central earmark of his art, and the first exhibition of work made using this 
printing method went up at MOMA in 1976. The response it elicited was hardly 
what the artist and curator had hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just hit the roof, which surprised me because the work was in such a 
hallowed institution," Eggleston recalls. "Everybody screamed, 'This isn't art! 
Why is this in a museum?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd intentionally constructed the pictures to make them look like ordinary 
snapshots anyone could've taken, and a lot of that had to do with the subject 
matter -- a picture of a shopping center parking lot, for instance. Because the 
pictures looked so simple, a lot of people didn't notice that the color and 
form were worked out, that the content came and went where it ought to -- that 
they were more than casual pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the squawking, the show launched Eggleston's career, and today his 
prints sell for as much as $20,000. Though the price of his work has gone up 
steadily for the past 18 years, the way he works hasn't changed at all. 
Eggleston always has a camera close at hand, and he shoots pictures -- with 
amazing discretion -- everywhere he goes. 
</P>
<P>
 At a lunch held in his honor at a Hollywood gallery, he takes pictures at the 
table without a word to his dining companions about what he's doing -- 
Eggleston wouldn't dream of instructing anyone to perform for his camera. At 
various points during the meal he silently wanders off to take pictures in the 
street and in the yard, and later, riding back to his hotel, he shoots pictures 
through the car window. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking pictures seems to be like breathing for Eggleston -- in fact, he's been 
quoted on several occasions as claiming that he no longer even needs to look 
through the viewfinder when he works. He says that quote isn't entirely 
accurate, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say I 'shoot from the hip,' but that's not really how I work," he 
says. "What happens is, when I look at something it registers on my mind so 
clearly that I can be loose when I shoot the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always just take one picture of something, and I've never staged a 
photograph in my life and never needed to -- there are pictures everywhere. If 
I'm ever in a place I think is impossible to photograph, I remember something 
(photographer) Garry Winogrand told me -- he said, 'Bill, you can take a good 
picture of anything,' and that's always stuck." 
</P>
<P>
 Eggleston may not stage his pictures, but he does agree that a few motifs 
recur in his work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true that a lot of my pictures have empty centers, and that's something 
I probably got from studying Japanese prints and Chinese paintings," he says. 
"A lot of those things are constructed so that everything is in the borders and 
there really won't be a center -- maybe just a little wisp or something. 
Western culture is hooked on the idea of the main thing being smack dab in the 
middle because people are so stupid. Most people look at a picture and if they 
don't see something recognizable in the middle, they move on to something 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 Many critics see Eggleston's work as a record of an America that's fast 
disappearing, but he says, "That's not something I'm conscious of. When I was 
taking the pictures those critics are probably referring to, as far as I knew 
those things were there for good. I didn't know that five years later this 
incredible Coke sign would be replaced by a 7-Eleven -- that never dawned on 
me, because up until the '60s, the South looked pretty much as it had during 
the Depression. But from the '60s on it became a different ballgame, and it's 
unrecognizable today from what it was. You been to the South lately? It's not 
interesting bad like L.A. -- it just looks like a bunch of idiots put the place 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 The interpretation that really puzzles Eggleston, however, is the fact that 
critics usually describe his work as romantic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never understood why people say that, because I don't romanticize the 
world," he says. "If you could turn back time and look at a place as it was 
when I photographed it, I think the picture and the place would look pretty 
much the same. I've never felt the need to enhance the world in my pictures, 
because the world is spectacular enough as it is."*

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; CLOTHING STORE IS ALL IN THE FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Family meetings can be serious business. Just ask Tracy Kincy Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a year after Kincy Morrison first met with about 20 relatives to 
discuss opening a family-owned business, the clan celebrated the grand opening 
of Rag-A-Muff'N, their small-children's resale clothing store on Central 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were always talking about starting a family business," said Kincy 
Morrison, the marketing manager. With nearly $5,000 in capital, she said, the 
family secured a small first-floor office at the historic Dunbar Hotel for 
their store at 4231 Central Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided we wanted to do a quality children's store, but we couldn't afford 
to bring in name brands like Guess. People here can't afford to pay $40 for a 
new pair of overalls." 
</P>
<P>
 The business strategy may pay off for the partnership, which netted nearly 
$200 in its first day of sales last week. Kincy Morrison is optimistic that 
sales will top the $60,000 mark in the store's first year. 
</P>
<P>
 But she and other family members insist their goal goes beyond making a 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, we're here because no one is going to invest in this community if we 
don't do it ourselves," said Olivia Thompson Green, a co-owner of the store and 
Kincy Morrison's niece. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing amid racks of designer-name overalls and tops for children up to age 
7, Kincy Morrison greeted passersby who walked in, encouraging them to check 
the prices -- most of which are less than $20 -- and urging them to tell their 
friends about the newest store on the block. 
</P>
<P>
 The store, which is open Mondays through Saturdays, is selling merchandise on 
consignment for area families. The family is also making plans for similar 
stores in Watts and Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 The family venture drew praise from the Dunbar Economic Development Corp., a 
nonprofit organization whose focus includes attracting capital to 
South-Central. "This is an opportunity to bring family-owned businesses that 
offer goods and services to the community back to Central Avenue," said Anthony 
Scott of Dunbar.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: EXPOSITION PARK; FUN RUN BENEFITS CRITICALLY ILL 
CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's the type of first that activist Danny Bakewell would have preferred not 
to establish. But two years after losing his 17-year-old daughter to leukemia, 
Bakewell and the Sabriya Castle Fun Foundation hope their first Fun Run at 
Exposition Park raised awareness and money to help critically ill children. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation, named for Bakewell's late daughter Sabriya, was formed in 1992 
to cheer up children suffering from leukemia and other life-threatening 
diseases by providing entertainment centers in hospitals around Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of what I'm interested in doing is something that is of instant 
gratification for the kids, that will help them ease their suffering the moment 
that it's rolled into their hospital room," Bakewell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raiser Saturday at Exposition Park was to include a 
three-quarter-mile walk and run through the Rose Garden and was expected to 
raise about $100,000. Proceeds will be used to build entertainment centers that 
resemble castles and feature puppets, a television set, a videocassette 
recorder, a music center, a video game center, and a library of videos, compact 
discs and games. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation's 40 castles, which cost about $3,500 each, have been brought 
to ailing youngsters at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center and Los 
Angeles Childrens Hospital, among other hospitals around the country. The money 
raised during the Fun Run will be used to assemble up to 30 new castles, 
Bakewell said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: WATTS; STUDENT TALENT RISES FROM THE PHOENIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mere suggestion causes David Brown to laugh, but the 40-year-old graphic 
artist admits that his life is beginning to show some peculiar similarities to 
his art. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is the creative force behind the Phoenix, a black comic book hero who 
flies through the city mediating racial and ethnic conflicts and helping 
youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the character he created, Brown is spending an increasing amount of time 
traveling around the city trying to reach students in Watts and South-Central 
with his message that art can help heal Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The) kids we're dealing with are really talented and it's a crucial time for 
them because they're young and curious," said Brown, who spends his days 
working at an advertising agency. "If they aren't encouraged to get into 
something like this, then they'll find something else to get into." 
</P>
<P>
 The weekly comic book art classes began in April, a result of a meeting of 
Brown and Mark Greenfield, director of the Watts Towers Art Center. Their goal 
was simple: expose students to an art form that is familiar to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Comic books capture kids' attention because they give you information in 
small bites," Greenfield said. "That's why I see what David is doing as 
invaluable by helping communicate higher values and morals and ideas to youth 
in the community."  
</P>
<P>
 Armed with pens, pencils and images of their favorite super-heroes, students 
ages 7 to 16 attend the Saturday afternoon classes, where they spend two hours 
learning the basics of drawing, comic book plot development and compiling a 
portfolio of their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "This provides me a chance to work with someone who is in the business, and I 
have someone to talk over my ideas with," said Oscar Madrigal, 16, of Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has drawn a steady corps of 15 students, said Greenfield, who 
added that plans are under way to expand the course to include an animation 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is funded through a grant from the city's Cultural Affairs 
Department, which also funded Brown's first comic book, "The Rise of the 
Phoenix." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said he doesn't mind being compared to his comic book creation, but he 
hopes to someday focus on his comic books and on his students full time. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of parallels in terms of both of us doing things in the 
community," Brown said. "And I want to continue working with these kids and 
helping them have role models. I wish there was someone in my life who'd taken 
a similar interest in me." SANDRA HERNANDEZ

THE ARTS; BUT WILL THE FRENCH THANK US?; THE AMERICAN CENTER DISAPPEARED FROM 
PARIS SEVEN YEARS AGO. NOW IT'S BACK WITH A $40-MILLION, FRANK GEHRY-DESIGNED 
BUILDING, A FULL CULTURAL SCHEDULE -- AND A DECIDEDLY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FEEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, Scott Kraft is The Times' Paris bureau chief. Times staff 
writer Suzanne Muchnic, in Los Angeles, contributed to this report. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some years back, a French business student came to the American Center in 
Paris with an idea -- just an idea -- for a new play he wanted to direct. The 
head of the American Center, Henry Pillsbury, was skeptical. But the stage had 
an open slot, so he listened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been making the point to everyone that the American Center was going to 
be more professional," Pillsbury remembered recently with a laugh. "But this 
guy had that real intense look, that holy fire. And his idea was so funny and 
so ridiculous that I figured, 'Why not?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The student, Daniel Benoin, went on to become head of one of France's biggest 
regional theaters, in St. Etienne, and, not surprisingly, one of the American 
Center's most loyal French fans. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of six decades, that's the way things were at the American Center in 
Paris: spontaneous and uninhibited -- even, sometimes, unedited. And open to 
all types of ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 But the private, nonprofit American Center disappeared from public sight seven 
years ago, closing its doors on the Left Bank, selling its building and laying 
plans for a grand new center across the Seine. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the plans were severely threatened by a worldwide drop in private 
funding for the arts and the center's own overly ambitious program. A staff was 
hired, then fired for lack of money. A grand opening was planned and postponed. 
It was, as one official recently recalled, "a very painful period." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, though, the American Center is back on the Paris scene. It will reopen to 
the public on Wednesday with an energetic new team of trustees, a staff of 32, 
a program committee of volunteers drawn from the U.S. art world, an exciting 
though modest schedule of cultural events -- and a decidedly Southern 
California feel. 
</P>
<P>
 The $40-million building, a seven-story marvel near the Gare de Lyon in 
east-central Paris, is the work of Los Angeles architect Frank O. Gehry. 
Frederick R. Weisman, the 82-year-old Los Angeles philanthropist, is 
responsible for the single largest contribution, of $5 million, to the center's 
operations endowment. And the inaugural exhibition is titled "Pure Beauty: Some 
Recent Work From Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 "In thinking of where the pulse of contemporary culture is today, it seemed 
appropriate for a group of strong and emerging artists in Los Angeles to open 
the space," said Madeleine Grynsztejn, an associate curator of 20th-Century art 
at the Art Institute of Chicago and member of the American Center's program 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The new American Center, like the old one, is being welcomed by le tout Paris, 
the French government and even a cultural Establishment that has frequently 
expressed annoyance with other American imports, from Coca-Cola to "Jurassic 
Park." 
</P>
<P>
 "We really welcome and greatly anticipate the reopening because of the 
importance of the center on a cultural level but also because of the 
architecture of the building itself," said Emmanuel de Roux, deputy cultural 
editor of the influential Parisian daily newspaper Le Monde. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone regretted it when the old center closed," he added. "So many new, 
creative things were happening there. And it was a way for the French to 
discover American art and artists." 
</P>
<P>
 "Pure Beauty," which will run until Aug. 15, was organized by Ann Goldstein, a 
curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. It will introduce the 
work of seven artists, all in their early 30s -- Richard Hawkins, T. Kelly 
Mason, Jorge Pardo, Sarah Seager, Thaddeus Strode, Diana Thater and Pae White. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein was one of several curators invited to submit proposals for the 
center's opening season under a "youth culture" theme. The title "Pure Beauty" 
is taken from a 1967-68 painting by Los Angeles-based artist John Baldessari, 
who hired a sign painter to brush those words onto a canvas in what is now 
considered a seminal work of art. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the center's vast, airy visual arts gallery, the California artists will 
show a similar irreverence for aesthetic purity, finding beauty -- or at least 
visual interest -- in everyday objects and ordinary experiences. Debunking the 
concept of art-as-precious-object and adopting a less worshipful attitude, they 
revel in mundane home and office furnishings, decorative fashions, magazine 
illustrations and the lives of anonymous people. 
</P>
<P>
 While each artist's work is distinctive, they share an interest in popular 
culture and engage in art as a personal occupation, Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Pillsbury, the 57-year-old executive director who has been associated 
with the American Center for 29 years, acknowledges that, at first, he resisted 
the selection of "Pure Beauty." But he came around after talking with architect 
Gehry, who is 65. 
</P>
<P>
 "Henry," Pillsbury remembers Gehry telling him with a shrug, "it's what the 
kids are doing today." 
</P>
<P>
 And, as Pillsbury noted recently, European impressions of the United States in 
recent years have been increasingly shaped by the West Coast. The choice of 
"Pure Beauty," like the selection of Gehry, "is an emphatic indication that the 
revitalized center intends to expose the broad measure of American culture," 
Pillsbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frederick B. Henry, president of the New York-based Bohen Foundation and 
co-chairman of the American Center's board of trustees, said the exhibition 
"puts us ahead of the wave -- this is what a significant group of artists from 
a very important region are doing today." 
</P>
<P>
 (After the showing in Paris, "Pure Beauty" goes to Los Angeles, where it will 
be on display at the Museum of Contemporary Art from Sept. 25 through Jan. 8.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The show is part of a full schedule of American Center programs for the year. 
Among other inaugural offerings here will be "Stations," a video and sound 
exhibition by Bill Viola, an internationally known video artist who lives in 
Long Beach. His five-channel color video and sound presentation, on view 
through Dec. 31, focuses on images of the human body submerged in water. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in the center's atrium, Nam June Paik, the Korean-born American media 
artist, is presenting two free-standing, 10-foot-tall video sculptures made out 
of vintage televisions, also through Dec. 31. The work, "David & Marat," was 
inspired by Jacques-Louis David's famous canvas "The Death of Marat." 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the year, center trustees plan "Banned in the U.S.A.," an exhibition 
of 24 once-censored films made since 1916, as well as a program of short films 
and videos titled "This Body, This Soul, This Brick, These Tears: Disorder 
Today." In November, a selection of John Cage's music will be presented by 
pianist Margaret Leng Tan, and writer Toni Morrison and composer Max Roach will 
present a collaborative work. 
</P>
<P>
 The center also plans a series of conferences, the first of which will discuss 
the globalization of American youth culture, particularly in the music 
recording industry. That will be followed by conferences on landscape 
architecture in urban parks and on the "memorialization" of war in France and 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Gehry began designing the new American Center, Judith Pisar, an American 
who has lived in Paris for 20 years and is co-chairman of the center, told him 
that she wanted "a contemporary statement with some elegance." 
</P>
<P>
 And although French critics have yet to weigh in with their assessments, 
officials at the American Center are delighted with the result: a sand-colored 
building of French limestone that is uniquely American but also compatible with 
the surrounding Parisian cityscape. 
</P>
<P>
 "This building is a cross between playing the guitar and working the computer, 
between high technology and tradition," said Pillsbury, who worked closely with 
Gehry on the design. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Gehry's graceful building, his first in Paris, is stuffed with show 
space. It has an intimate, 350-seat theater with a well-equipped proscenium 
stage, balcony and boxes along the side walls. There are two "black box" 
studios, a 100-seat movie theater and lecture hall and the tall visual arts 
gallery where "Pure Beauty" will open. 
</P>
<P>
 Two big studios have been set aside for visual and performing artists, and 
there also are classrooms, offices and apartments for visiting artists and 
scholars. Space also has been set aside for a bookstore and an American-style 
cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Center, with its new park and plaza, was a key part of the French 
government's redevelopment plan for the Bercy district, in the 12th 
arrondissement , once home to factories and warehouses along the Seine. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the neighborhood includes the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy, a 
17,000-seat pyramid-shaped building, and a large complex that houses research 
and office facilities for the wine industry and other agricultural industries. 
Public areas have been redesigned, and new low Parisian-style apartment 
buildings have been built. 
</P>
<P>
 The government is delighted to have its American cultural institution back in 
business. Despite the heated cross-Atlantic debates over American cultural 
imperialism, centering mostly on Hollywood films, the American Center has long 
had a special place in the hearts of the French. 
</P>
<P>
 Pisar, who has been associated with the center for years, recently received 
the Legion of Honor from the government in a ceremony attended by the present 
minister of culture and several of his predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The objectives of the new American Center are numerous and diverse, as they 
have always been. 
</P>
<P>
 The center was founded in 1931 by American expatriates who hoped to keep their 
children from prowling the Paris cafes. It went through several sharp changes 
over the years, from a time when coats and ties were de rigueur to the days 
when drug deals were made in the halls and anti-Vietnam War slogans were 
painted on the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 At the old headquarters in Montparnasse on the Boulevard Raspail, it played 
host to such famous writers as Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Henry Miller, 
F. Scott Fitzgerald and William Styron, as well as artists including Jackson 
Pollock. And it gave opportunities for many important American dancers, 
composers, dramatists and performers, from Merce Cunningham and John Cage to 
Sam Shepard and Trisha Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout its history, the center was a haven for American art and 
experimental French art, a meeting place for American and French artists and a 
center for artistic as well as linguistic education. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the cultural relationship between the United States and France has 
changed in the past two decades. For one thing, artists and people interested 
in art on both sides of the Atlantic are more mobile these days. And Paris no 
longer needs an expatriates' club into which Americans can escape for a taste 
of home. The challenge for the new American Center will be to strengthen the 
cultural links between the Americans and the French. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old center was a place where you could feel American curiosity, the odd 
angle," said Rachel Newton Bellow, program officer for the arts and culture 
with the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in New York, who has taken a leave to work 
with the center. "We're trying to re-create that aspect. We're not just a 
showcase for American work. We will highlight an American approach to culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Bellow and others believe the center also may be in a perfect position to 
offer a sense of universal American expression, something that has all but 
disappeared from the American arts scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody in America is interested in the specificity of their own ethnic 
origins and in ethnic expressions," Bellow said. "But at some point, universal 
expression is bound to reappear. And where do you achieve universal expression? 
The best place to mix it up is an international institution." 
</P>
<P>
 The new center, mindful of the overly ambitious plans that nearly destroyed it 
a few years ago, is being launched gradually. The original plan for a 
$1.5-million exhibition of commissioned art was shelved, for example, and 
replaced by programs with budgets averaging $250,000. A decision on offering 
English-language classes, as in the old center, will be made later. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's financial goal is an annual operating budget of $5 million to $8 
million with an endowment of $25 million. About $9 million has been raised so 
far, but Pillsbury says that's enough for the gradual reopening. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With that cautious beginning, Pillsbury hopes to recapture the spirit of the 
old place, which the French often called "une bouffee d'air frais" (a breath of 
fresh air). The early schedule of programs, from the exhibitions to the 
conferences, reflects a desire to showcase American art but also to highlight 
and strengthen the cross-Atlantic links. 
</P>
<P>
 "These days, there's almost more bull about how great the center was in the 
old days than I can stomach," said Pillsbury, who first joined the center as a 
theater director in the 1960s. "But it was a place in town where, 
systematically, there was a sense of unpredictability. It was unencumbered. It 
served a purpose in this country, and I think it will continue to serve a 
purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Bellow: "It will take people like Henry, who were there, in the old 
spirit, to remind the American Center periodically not to take itself too 
seriously."

OVERWHELMED BY BOTH COMMERCIAL SUCCESS AND CRITICISM FROM PEERS AND CRITICS -- 
EVEN BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD -- STONE TEMPLE PILOTS NEARLY SELF-DESTRUCTED.; 
THEY'RE BACK, AND IT'S NO WONDER THEIR NEW ALBUM, 'PURPLE,' HAS A DARK EDGE; 
'IT'S AMAZING WE EVEN MADE IT'

<P>
 The members of Stone Temple Pilots have spent much of the past year gritting 
their teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 While nearly 4 million fans were bonding with the bittersweet melodies of the 
quartet's debut album, the band itself was coming apart at the seams. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the success of the group's album, "Core," caused such deep problems 
within the Southern California group that its members went an entire six months 
without speaking to one another.  
</P>
<P>
 The main problem: credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The band, whose second album, "Purple," is due out Tuesday (see review, Page 
60) , has been accused by critics and other musicians of riding on the 
coattails of Seattle's rock scene -- from STP's sound to its very demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 Video connoisseurs Beavis and Butt-head summarized what many were thinking as 
the two watched the band's "Plush" video on MTV. One of the pubescent dudes 
accused the band of ripping off Pearl Jam. No, the other whined, it was Pearl 
Jam that ripped off these guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Weiland, STP's lead singer who just goes by his last name, is hardly 
unaffected by the accusations. The 26-year-old's angelic face often knots with 
worry and his strawberry-blond hair looks as though it's been raked over by 
nervous hands as he considers the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "People make it sound like we suddenly appeared from nowhere, made a record 
and sold 4 million copies," he says during an interview in West Hollywood's 
Sunset Marquis Hotel, where the band has gathered from home bases that stretch 
from San Diego to Topanga Canyon. A rumpled cotton shirt hangs off his small 
frame, while his stiff, new boots creak as he fidgets uncomfortably on the 
couch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the reason we seem new is we tried to distance ourself from the L.A. 
scene. The truth is we played small clubs and watched a lot of other bands get 
blown up and hyped out before ever doing anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiland's songwriting partner, Robert DeLeo, is also troubled by the 
comparisons. 
</P>
<P>
 "How could you not be personally affected or hurt by someone dissing what's so 
personal to you?" says the 28-year-old bassist, whose clean-cut, suburban look 
is squarely conservative next to Weiland's more disheveled appearance, and 
seems severely out of place in the hard rock world STP's been pegged into. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts at times. . . . The last thing I wanted to do with this band was 
make everybody believe we invented something. Hopefully, we're just 
contributing to something. But the industry is always looking for the next big 
thing, like the whole Seattle scene. It got to a silly point that any band that 
comes out that is trying to express themselves is lumped into a category." 
</P>
<P>
 That pain, and the mounting pressures that come with success, left the band 
members at odds with each other about career goals and musical directions, and 
collectively unable to plan a next move. But after half a year apart, the 
group, which plays July 16 at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre and July 19 at the 
Greek Theatre, went to Atlanta to record, and in the studio, away from the 
world's eyes, began to gel again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robert and I have been writing together for eight years," Weiland says. 
"We're complete polar opposites. We always write our best music when 
antagonizing each other or there's some uncomfortable element there. But 
before, it was more superficial. Now the circumstances run much deeper." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just mention Stone Temple Pilots in the rock world and you're likely to start 
a debate -- or at least trigger a smarmy comment or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibby Haynes of the Butthole Surfers once referred to them as Stone Pimple 
Toilets. Rocket From the Crypt, a band at the forefront of San Diego's much 
lauded independent music scene, claims STP tried to align itself with the city 
for credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocket's singer John Reis once charged that STP "changes with whatever (hot) 
sound is next." Spin magazine last year sharply noted that STP has "ridden the 
backwash of the grunge wave far beyond anyone's wildest dreams, even their 
own." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no doubt that Weiland's quavering, low voice is similar to Eddie 
Vedder's and STP's slow creeping guitar style is like that of Alice in Chains. 
But the similarities are more likely due to the fact that all three bands 
pilfer riffs from '70s bands such as Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone Temple Pilots -- which also includes Eric Kretz on drums and DeLeo's 
older brother, Dean, on guitar -- comes up with the most accessible sound, 
stripping the band of even more precious credibility in alternative rockdom, 
where success is often equated with compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's hypnotic melodies emit more hope than the disturbed and 
introverted sound of Alice in Chains, and while Vedder sweats out lines like 
"Once upon a time, I could control myself," Weiland's lyrics are more cryptic. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiland's also not so self-obsessed as some of the artists with whom he's been 
compared. His lyrics align STP with outside issues, including feminism. 
Weiland's unorthodox angle was so unexpected that his anti-rape song "Sex Type 
Thing" was misconstrued as glorifying a rapist's mentality: "I'm a man, I'll 
give you something you won't forget. You shouldn't have worn that dress."  
</P>
<P>
 But bands that follow commercially on the heels of booming breakthroughs in 
rock often meet with skepticism -- and wind up having to prove their 
worthiness. It happened to Pearl Jam in the wake of Nirvana's success, though 
Pearl Jam's riff-rock had little to do with Nirvana's unparalleled blend of 
gritty pop. 
</P>
<P>
 Strip away the nasty comments and can't-win comparisons surrounding STP, and 
the band stands as a credible -- not revolutionary -- force. It's far above the 
dozens of complete grunge knock-offs, but has gained enough notoriety to become 
a reference point for any Seattle wanna-be jokes that are busting to be told.  
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly believe, from some of the (expletive) that I've read in the last 
year, that they couldn't have listened to the whole album. Maybe they just 
heard a single or watched one video and based the whole existence of the band 
off one song," says Robert DeLeo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shell-shocked when the first album took off," recalls Weiland. "It was 
pompous to assume we were gonna be big stars, but I must have known something 
would happen because I didn't have a plan B." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Weiland was born in San Jose, but his parents divorced early on, and his 
mother moved with him to the sleepy, one-school town of Chagrin Falls, Ohio, 
when he was 5.  
</P>
<P>
 His family moved back to Southern California when Weiland was 15, setting up 
house in Huntington Beach, where he attended high school. He went to Orange 
Coast College in Costa Mesa, but was more interested in starting up a power 
punk band with a guitarist friend, which began playing around Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiland worked construction jobs and catering gigs to pay the rent, and at one 
point worked as a graphic artist at a local paper after lying about his 
qualifications. "I told them I was a student at Otis/Parsons (art school)," he 
recalls. "It worked." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert DeLeo, the youngest in a family of 10 children from his mother's 
several marriages, grew up in New Jersey listening to his parents' collection 
of the Mamas and the Papas and Carpenters albums. In 1982 he started playing 
bass in a cover band that his brother Dean had started. After high school, he 
moved to California in 1984, living in his car or crashing at friends' houses 
between San Diego and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert DeLeo and Weiland met at a Black Flag show in Orange County in the 
mid-'80s and started playing together. But it wasn't until their original 
guitarist quit to pursue a budding cookie delivery business that they brought 
Dean and Kretz in to form a band called Mighty Joe Young.  
</P>
<P>
 After playing regularly in Orange County and occasionally in San Diego and Los 
Angeles, the band signed to Atlantic Records in 1992. A Chicago bluesman 
already using the name Mighty Joe Young was in part behind the moniker change, 
but Weiland had another concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to change the name anyway because of any association we might have 
with that band Ugly Kid Joe. I was deathly afraid that people would get 
confused," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Core" was released in September, 1992 -- and had climbed to No. 3 on the 
national charts by the following May. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiland remembers the rush that followed the album's popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have a lot of time to sit back and think about it because we were 
on the road constantly," says the singer. "It hit when we broke down on tour, 
and that's when we started breaking down personally. We canceled the tour, 
flipped out, and had to come home. We stayed apart until we made the record. 
It's amazing we even made it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now Weiland's bracing himself for the repercussions bound to follow the 
Pilots' new album. The collection is moodier and at points darker than "Core," 
which may reflect the mind-set of its makers at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of dissension between myself and the band while recording 
this album," says Weiland. "But sometimes that kind of negative energy breeds 
positive energy in the end. It feels like that conflict almost drove the sound. 
And now that we're actually speaking again, I hear an element of hope in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Success hasn't just been a confining experience for the band. Weiland says. 
Ironically, it's also set them free. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's added to the sense of freedom we felt as individuals to be honest with 
our music, without having to feel we needed to fit into a certain category or 
match our last album. I don't think any of us felt that second-album kind of 
pressure. Instead, there were a lot of other things that came along. Like the 
myth of rock stardom you get set up with." 
</P>
<P>
 What is the Rock Myth? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the overall feel that success brings instant self-worth, gratification 
and happiness," explains Weiland, relaxing as the interview goes on. "But 
there's so many outside things that corrupt that. Take, for example, a show. 
It's different when you're playing for free beer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's passion, excitement -- the reasons you initially got into it. But it 
hits a certain point when you're not playing a show, you're putting on a 
production. If you can have a sense of humor about it, it helps -- but that's 
sometimes hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert DeLeo agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can go on believing you're a rock star or get to a point when you realize 
rock is really silly," he says. "I won't allow anything in this business to 
take over what or who I am. I was me before any of this happened and I'll be me 
after all this blows over. It can't last forever. I'll be what I was before 
this started: myself."

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: ELYSIAN VALLEY; FACTORY PARKING LOT PLAN TO BE DEBATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A public hearing will be held June 28 on a cleaning-solvent factory owner's 
appeal to turn a vacant, 1.75-acre parcel into a 25-space parking lot for 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Rosenbaum, president of Mission Kleensweep Products Inc., said a parking 
lot at 2428 Birkdale St. would benefit the neighborhood by reducing the number 
of vehicles parked on streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's simply the right thing to do," Rosenbaum said. "We're not expanding." 
</P>
<P>
 But that's exactly what a group of residents fear most about Mission 
Kleensweep, which manufactures detergents, hand soaps and cleaners for 
commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 residents banded together in March to oppose Rosenbaum's first bid 
for a conditional-use permit for the lot. The property, which used to be a 
two-unit house, is zoned for single-family homes only. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents' complaints about early morning truck traffic and foul-smelling and 
possibly hazardous chemicals emitting from the firm persuaded a zoning 
administrator to reject the owner's request. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Rosenbaum is seeking to overturn that decision through the city's 
five-member Board of Zoning Appeals, the community is gearing up for another 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be down there (at the hearing) like we were before," said Virginia 
Adams, co-president of the Elysian Valley Property Owners, Renters & 
Businessmen's Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams said an employee parking lot would only create additional space on 
public streets for large trucks. Rosenbaum uses the trucks to deliver cargo.  
</P>
<P>
 The association has since collected more than 700 signatures against 
Rosenbaum's project. "He's not a good neighbor, regardless of what he says," 
Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Association members are also planning to keep a close eye on the company's 
truck traffic and manufacturing processes. Residents hope the complaints will 
help lay the groundwork for a civil suit against the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenbaum said he hopes the zoning appeals board will recognize his efforts in 
resolving the community's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 He has scaled back all truck deliveries to no earlier than 6:30 a.m. and is 
replacing an old sawdust-sweeping machine, which had allowed small chips of 
wood to be blown throughout the neighborhood on windy days. 
</P>
<P>
 An air-filtration system should also be installed by the end of this month to 
mitigate odor problems, Rosenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going at a fever pitch to correct the three or four things that the 
neighbors had been complaining about," he said. "I always care to be a good, 
corporate citizen and a good neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents as well as Los Angeles Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg are regarding 
Rosenbaum's actions cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's yet to be seen if the measures he is taking will result in an 
improvement," said David Hershey-Webb, a member of Goldberg's staff. "The fact 
that he's willing to take measures to improve relations with the community is a 
good sign." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenbaum, who bought the 1.75-acre property early last year, has yet to 
decide whether to bring the matter to the City Council should he lose his bid 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a terrible thought -- to have to fight for something which I think is a 
positive." TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: ECHO PARK; HUNGER STRIKE STAGED OVER BUS HIKE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's recent proposal to 
hike bus fares by 25 cents, members of a Latino activist group have staged a 
hunger strike at a local bus stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone has to do it for those who can't defend themselves," said Jose 
Mendoza, 37, a member of Grupo Latino Echo Park. "Someone has to say, 'No way,' 
to the fare increases." 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza and Eustasio Castro, 48, began their fast last week as part of Grupo 
Latino's effort to protest the proposed cutbacks in bus service and fare hikes 
to meet a $126-million shortfall in a proposed $647.4-million operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
 From Monday through Wednesday, they sat at Sunset Boulevard and Echo Park 
Avenue, near an MTA bus stop, and surrounded themselves with signs that read, 
"Hunger Strike, Down With the MTA." They spent their evenings inside a tent at 
Echo Park but were asked to leave Wednesday morning by park rangers. Mendoza 
said Wednesday afternoon that they plan to pitch a tent on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA spokesman Rick Jager declined to comment on the hunger strike, but said 
that people can present their concerns to the MTA board. Meetings have 
tentatively been scheduled for 1 p.m. Friday at an undetermined site, and 10 
a.m. June 18 at the County Board of Supervisors' hearing room, 500 W. Temple 
St. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that the modest fare increase that the budget is proposing merely 
catches up with other major metropolitan agencies across the nation as well as 
here in California," Jager said. "The MTA has not raised fares in six years." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Gonzales, founder and president of Grupo Latino, organized the bus 
stop protest and also staged marches last week around the bus stop during the 
evening rush hour. She said she plans daily protests until the MTA revokes its 
plans to raise bus fares. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that MTA didn't listen to us . . . the people who ride the buses," 
Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
 She also contends that the increase to $1.35 per ride would be especially 
unfair to low-income families, most of whom earn less than minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to ride a bus like three to four times a day -- it's too much," she 
said. TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: PICO-UNION/KOREATOWN; TENSIONS STILL ROILING OVER 
STREET VENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAKE DOHERTY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although establishing legal street vending zones -- approved by the City 
Council in January -- offers hope for a settlement on the contentious issue, 
proponents and opponents are finding the road to compromise strewn with 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Some vendors say they are caught in a Catch-22: Street vending is still a 
misdemeanor, but it is their only source of income and the only way they can 
save money for the permits and licenses that will be required. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 850 police citations were issued to vendors in the first five months of 
this year -- compared with 952 for all of last year -- meaning that fines, 
arrests and confiscated merchandise remain possibilities, according to 
testimony last week before the Police Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have families. We have bills. We want to be allowed to work," said 
Leobardo Cabral, president of the Street Vendors Assn. Cabral appealed for an 
easing of enforcement actions during the interim before vending zones are 
established. 
</P>
<P>
 Cmdr. Scott LaChasse, who oversees the Police Department's interaction with 
street vendors, said enforcement occurs only when officers receive complaints 
from businesses or residents and only after requests for voluntary compliance 
fail. 
</P>
<P>
 That response was disputed by Javier Rodriguez, administrator for the vendors 
association, who said he has heard of few merchant complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 But Police Commissioner Art Maddox said he knows of many businesses that are 
"very concerned" about street vending. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Oh, a restaurateur and a representative for the 8th Street Korean 
American Merchants Assn., said his colleagues complain about what they consider 
to be unfair competition posed by street vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Merchants on 8th Street say the vendors are hurting their business because 
they sell many of the same items for less," Oh said. "They can do that because 
(vendors) don't have to pay rent or employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Father Dennis O'Neil of St. Thomas the Apostle Church, said in a telephone 
interview that most neighbors around his parish near Pico Boulevard and 
Mariposa Avenue accept the vendors as entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Hernandez is not among them. A member of a Neighborhood Watch group 
around Mariposa Avenue, Hernandez supports increased police enforcement. He 
worries that vendors lower the value of property in his neighborhood. "The 
vendors who sell food are the big problem," he said. "Sometimes you can't pass 
on the sidewalk or there are cars double-parked on the street. Sometimes they 
leave trash around and yell at you if you say anything." 
</P>
<P>
 George Richter, a member of the Beverly-Kingsley Neighborhood Assn. and the 
Wilshire Community Police Advisory Board, has similar concerns. "We have 
vendors in our neighborhood who sell replica pistols, cap guns and slingshots," 
Richter said. "I don't want that in front of my house." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rodriguez: "That's why we are fighting for the establishment of 
regularization and special zones. Some of the streets aren't the nicest, and if 
we do it right, vendors can attract business and liven up an area." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Thomas recently received a $5,000 grant from World Vision to prepare 
vendors for participation in the legal vending zones. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of the vendors "feel betrayed" because the city has not done more to 
help them establish the zones, O'Neil said. JAKE DOHERTY

NORMA DEAREST; FAYE DUNAWAY BECAME A STAR JUST AS 'OLD HOLLYWOOD' WAS 
DISAPPEARING. WITH THAT PERSPECTIVE, WHO BETTER TO PLAY NORMA DESMOND, THE 
GREATEST STAR OF THEM ALL? SHE'S READY TO RISK THE DRIVE ON 'SUNSET BOULEVARD'

<P>
 For Norma Desmond, aging silent screen star in "Sunset Boulevard," the advent 
of talking pictures spelled the end of her career.  
</P>
<P>
 Faye Dunaway saw Hollywood unofficially relieve her of her movie-star crown in 
the 1980s as she entered her 40s; looking back, she said she sometimes feared 
her own career might take Norma Desmond's downward spiral. Rather than face 
that crisis, in the early '80s she headed to England with son Liam and 
then-husband Terry O'Neill, spending nearly a decade away from the aggressive 
youth culture of the United States. Although she made occasional transatlantic 
treks to take roles in U.S. productions, she remained a virtual expatriate for 
most of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 53 -- three years past Norma Desmond's age in "Sunset Boulevard" -- 
Dunaway is getting ready to face one of her biggest career challenges. A month 
ago, she was named to replace Glenn Close on July 5 in her critically acclaimed 
role as Norma Desmond in the Los Angeles production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's 
musical "Sunset Boulevard," based on Billy Wilder's 1950 film starring Gloria 
Swanson. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her escape to England, Dunaway always kept a hand in the U.S. film 
scene, taking occasional film roles, and doing plenty of work in television. 
Among her many TV credits was the critically acclaimed 1989 TV movie "Cold 
Sassy Tree" for TNT cable. 
</P>
<P>
 She stayed big. It was the screen that got small. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now Dunaway has gone back to doing things big. She has landed one of the 
juiciest musical stage roles for women past ingenue age. Despite having no 
professional singing experience, Dunaway was the winner out of an illustrious 
list of candidates rumored to include Meryl Streep, Diahann Carroll, Shirley 
MacLaine, Diana Ross, Raquel Welch -- and even Zsa Zsa Gabor. Dunaway now is 
busily training her voice in marathon sessions with vocal coach Bob Corff, and 
for the moment, she refuses to let outsiders hear her sing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunaway said that, with a few additions, she will wear the same sumptuous 
Anthony Powell wardrobe Close wears in the show, but said she may go "bigger" 
with the character, and added that she has been in discussions with Lloyd 
Webber about how to make the character her own. "I won't be Swanson, I can't be 
Swanson, I'm gonna be me," she said. "But, maybe, it's going to be closer to 
what they did in the movie than what's currently being done onstage -- I don't 
quite know yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I've already evolved certain things in terms of age, and (a desire to 
create) a kind of gossamer thing about her. Anthony has already given me more 
veils, more than I can play with, so there's illusion and reality -- there's a 
face, but it's hidden." 
</P>
<P>
 Since it opened in London a year ago, the show has been a constant source of 
rumors. Patti LuPone, who portrayed the role in London and was originally 
signed for Broadway, got some negative reviews -- leading to speculation that 
Close, not LuPone, would go to Broadway. Initially, Lloyd Webber and LuPone, as 
well as Close herself, denied it, but now LuPone has been paid off, and Close 
is packing her bags for New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunaway often turned up in gossip columns as a contender, but then so did many 
others. "Every time someone else's name was mentioned in the gossip columns, 
I'd get a hundred phone messages saying, 'Oh, I'm so sorry,' " Dunaway said 
with a frustrated laugh during a recent conversation over breakfast at the 
Hotel Bel Air. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's because this is such an event , you know? I want to send a note to 
Glenn that says, this is because of you and Andrew (Lloyd Webber), who have 
made this such an event that people are just sort of . . . nuts!" 
</P>
<P>
 Dunaway said that, like any woman faced with getting older in Hollywood, she 
empathizes more than a little with the desperately fading Norma Desmond. 
Despite a career highlighted by acclaimed films such as 1967's "Bonnie and 
Clyde," which launched her career, 1974's "Chinatown" and the 1976 "Network," 
for which she won a best actress Oscar, Dunaway said that there have been 
enough failures, misfires (most notably portraying Joan Crawford in 1981's 
"Mommie Dearest," a campy celebration of black eyebrow pencil, shoulder pads 
and coat hangers) and dry spells in her career to make her know the fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "That whole decade of the '80s, I was really out of sight, out of mind," mused 
Dunaway. "I came back (from England) because I think I missed my country. So I 
think that was a period when I thought, well, I'm going to have to really see 
what I can do with this, sort of, final chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (the role of Norma Desmond) is kind of a natural for me, in a way. I'm 
going to play her as 50, the age she was in the movie. I think there's 
something that Wilder was trying to say about a 50-year-old woman in Hollywood 
that does not apply to a 50-year-old woman in any other walk of life. You can 
be a great journalist when you're 50; you can be a senator when you are 50. You 
can be almost anything, except a model or an actress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember when I was 18, all I wanted was to be 25, or 30. And, I remember, 
as a New York Times article said then, that Barbara Stanwyck, for example, 
always seemed to be 38. The stars weren't young. You didn't see stars that 
looked like Julia Roberts. The fashion until recently was that the leading 
ladies were more, kind of, womanly. 
</P>
<P>
 "They used to be women, not girls. But then, by 50, they still weren't 
working." 
</P>
<P>
 And, Dunaway added, she connects with Norma Desmond for another reason -- she 
knows a Hollywood lifestyle that may never exist again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came in on the tail end of the star system, I think," Dunaway said. "The 
costumes, for example: For 'Chinatown,' for 'Bonnie and Clyde,' they were all 
handmade. . . . It was still like the old Hollywood. You don't get much of the 
old Hollywood anymore. I'm sort of a 'bridge' character in a funny way, you 
know. It's a whole arena that I'm familiar with." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since "Mommie Dearest," Dunaway said, "I've absolutely shied away from doing a 
larger-than-life movie-star role. Because I'd attempted it once, and . . . I 
think my work was good in that movie, but it didn't tell the story of what 
really happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Music and lyrics provide Lloyd Webber's "Sunset Boulevard" with the subtext 
"Mommie Dearest" lacked, Dunaway said. "More than the speech . . . it does 
reveal the soul of the woman," she said. "It's like a close-up in the movies. 
In an instant, you can reveal it. People don't say their emotions." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunaway said she hopes that playing Norma Desmond will, in some way, give her 
a chance to rethink the star syndrome of "Mommie Dearest." "It didn't work, it 
didn't come out the way we initially hoped, but we wanted to get at this thing 
that is stardom, and how insidious and powerful it is, you know," Dunaway said. 
"Judy Garland was killed by this star system -- it was pills to keep you up, 
and pills to bring you back down."  
</P>
<P>
 While she considers herself a survivor, Dunaway said she knows Hollywood's 
power all too well. "You have people who perpetuate the illusion," Dunaway 
said. "People who will be able to get a raise in salary on your next movie if 
they keep you feeling that you're the biggest star. It's part of the business. 
And it has happened to me. I've had people in my life at times who (helped me) 
ostrich myself up, and I didn't really get to see what was happening. But 
(those people) live off you. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be strong in this business, you really have to be strong. I mean, 
the whole movie-making business is tough. It's very tough. The hours are really 
long, and what fracturing it does to your own reality is very tricky. I think 
there are some people who have it mastered, but there are tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens is, in Norma's case -- and I'm sure for me in some degree -- 
there was a period in my stardom . . . where you are in kind of a cocoon, away 
from reality. But she was told that no, she was still the greatest star. She 
was still the greatest star. 
</P>
<P>
 "And when you live in an illusion, and that illusion is stripped away from you 
the way (Norma's younger lover) Joe Gillis does in the final scenes, you cannot 
accept it. And the truth smacks up and breaks you -- and breaks you.  
</P>
<P>
 "In the end, her dream enfolded her. Just took her. It was the pain of having 
to face the truth."  
</P>
<P>
 Dunaway -- whose speeding train of thought takes frequent detours, stops and 
occasional complete derailments -- took a contemplative pause. "Maybe I will 
touch what I'm trying to say here if I can just be quiet about trying to find 
it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the tragedy, I think. . . . What is the tragedy of Hollywood, of 
movies and of stardom? You live in a certain reality, and that reality is very 
heightened. And it's the best of everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "They used to bring trays of real jewelry for (Norma) to choose which one she 
wanted to wear in the scene, you know. And the garments were all hand-sewn. 
They were immaculately fitted. It was just like royalty, (the stars) were our 
kings and queens. She says this wonderful thing: 'We taught the world new ways 
to dream. To dream.' So it's great. It's big, what they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunaway is attracted to big dreams. If you've never sung a note in public, 
what more logical next step than to audition for a starring role in an Andrew 
Lloyd Webber musical? 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, it's been a dream of mine to sing," Dunaway said. "I'm from the 
South (born in Bascom, Fla., she has lived throughout the South); I used to 
sing country and western whenever I could. And with my first husband, (former 
J. Geils Band singer) Peter Wolf, we used to sing a lot. But I never studied it 
seriously. I never had a reason. This gave me a very important reason." 
</P>
<P>
 When she first became interested in the role (she says her decision to 
approach the "Sunset" people was concurrent with them approaching her ), she 
was invited in to sing. "They said: 'Just come in, and let's see if you can 
carry a tune; we'll get you a great coach.' And I said, no, let me work a 
little bit on my own first. I worked for only two or three weeks. Every day. 
Long hours. And then I auditioned for (musical supervisor) David Caddick. And 
then we spoke, and, because I had no real training, he said, 'I don't know if 
(pursuing this role) is what you want.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It was what she wanted. So Caddick suggested that Dunaway work with Corff, the 
voice coach who trained Close in the beginning. Dunaway worked with him "for 
four weeks straight, between two and nine hours a day, every day." Then she 
auditioned for Caddick again. "The second time I auditioned, he kind of sat 
back and said, 'Well, that's quite a difference!' "  
</P>
<P>
 And then came "the most terrifying thing I've ever done" -- an audition for 
Lloyd Webber. Afterward, he called Dunaway personally to tell her she had the 
part. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a technique. It's still a very new discipline for me, but you know, you 
can learn to sing," she said. "And then I guess how good you get depends on a 
lot of things. But it seems like I can carry a tune, and I know notes. I can 
hit a note when I hear it. So my ear seems to be good." 
</P>
<P>
 With stage microphones, Dunaway said, "you don't have to have a big voice . . 
. but you have to be able to sustain notes, and you have to be able to hit big 
notes and hold them. (LuPone), for example, has a very big voice. . . . I'm not 
so immodest as to believe I can ever sing along those lines. But I intend to 
keep trying, and to see what I am capable of." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Upon being cast as Norma Desmond, Close, in her mid-40s, admitted she had some 
fears about playing an older character, and one so much defined by age. For 
Dunaway, the concern about finding herself identified with this role might be a 
little different. She has been strongly identified with tough, cold movie roles 
such as Bonnie Parker, "Network's" ratings-crazed TV executive Diana 
Christensen and frosty Joan Crawford; psychotic screen queen Norma Desmond also 
fits neatly into that weird mold. Moreover, Desmond is the quintessential 
"difficult" actor -- and Dunaway, rightly or wrongly, has developed her own 
reputation as the movie star from hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunaway has no problem acknowledging that she's 53. She baldly admits such 
career mistakes as "Mommie Dearest." She has relished unsympathetic and 
unattractive roles, jumped with ego-less ease from movie stardom to TV sitcoms. 
She's maintained that kind of experimentation, leading her to include a 
"Columbo" movie with Peter Falk among her credits. And, of course, there's the 
Lloyd Webber audition. 
</P>
<P>
 She speaks with cheerful resignation about her failed TV series last fall, "It 
Had to Be You." The CBS show cast Dunaway as a successful book publisher who 
falls for a widowed carpenter (Robert Urich) with three kids. It lasted four 
episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wanted to try comedy. And I still do, and I still will," Dunaway 
said. "I think that kind of comedy doesn't seem to be right for me. It's like 
snapshots. It's jokes. I think the comedians do best in it. You cannot work the 
way I normally work -- I mean, how detailed I get, and how intensive the 
research is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone who tried it did the best they could do. It really wasn't 
meant to be. I don't think it's anyone's fault -- not the writers, not me, not 
Urich. In retrospect it just wasn't the right place for me. All of them were 
great, but you just can't get your hands around it. I felt like water was just 
going through my fingers." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, despite steely nerve, as far as career choices are concerned let an 
interviewer suggest that Dunaway has a press reputation for being "difficult" 
and she dissolves into a panic almost like Norma Desmond does when she loses 
Joe Gillis. One might think by now that Dunaway would have become hardened to 
celebrity journalism. Not so. 
</P>
<P>
 Raise the issue of her well-known reputation to Dunaway and she, quite simply, 
shatters. She is shaken. She is angry. She is upset enough to threaten to end 
an interview. "If that's what you want to talk about, I would like to leave," 
she said. "Now -- I would like to say what I want to say in this article." 
</P>
<P>
 She leaves abruptly for a few minutes to pull herself together. She returns, 
however, and gamely continues. And while she remains evasive about her reputed 
bad-girl behavior in Hollywood, she hints that a failure to click with director 
Roman Polanski on the set of "Chinatown" just may have set the tone for a 
reputation that lingers two decades later. 
</P>
<P>
 "The need to build you up is equaled only by the need to bring you down. . . . 
You can't have all good experiences in life, and you're not gonna come off 
great sometimes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And there would be exaggerations, and sometimes there will be exaggerations 
and everything else is false," she continued slowly. "There will be a kernel of 
truth, and everything else has been embroidered over it.  
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, it was just an unfortunate connection between me and Roman. He is a 
great filmmaker. I think he respects me as well. I just think we met at a time 
in our lives when neither one of us could kind of give, and say: 'Hey, wait a 
minute, let me step back.' Which is what I do now, all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have worked with Dunaway recently are not sure from whence her 
dragon lady reputation springs. Jeremy Leven, writer-director of the upcoming 
film "Don Juan de Marco and the Centerfold," called Dunaway "charming and 
gracious and a real doll." 
</P>
<P>
 While one individual associated with her failed sitcom noted cryptically that 
"there are two Fayes," Terry Corigliano, director of CBS' media relations, said 
that Dunaway had personally called the network and asked to meet with the 
marketing and publicity staff who would be handling her show -- turning down 
their invitation to a frilly lunch at Maple Drive to hunker down over a 
sandwich in a CBS conference room. 
</P>
<P>
 "She asked us questions, and really wanted to learn about TV," Corigliano 
said. "I don't think we've ever had a star do that before. By the time she was 
ready to start promoting that show, Faye Dunaway knew what she was supposed to 
know." 
</P>
<P>
 When the freshly divorced Dunaway returned to the United States from England, 
her first film role was with Mickey Rourke as two down-and-out alcoholics in 
Barbet Schroeder's 1987 film "Barfly." Rourke -- whose reputation for 
temperament possibly outshines Dunaway's -- offered an unsolicited advance 
review of "Sunset Boulevard" when Dunaway replaces Close: "It'll be a much 
better show." 
</P>
<P>
 "Before Faye and I got together, I heard horror stories about her, and I'm 
sure she heard the same thing about me," Rourke said. "But everything I heard 
about her was not true -- and, I guess, vice versa. I can honestly say I don't 
think I have worked with anybody who is as professional as she was. I 
appreciated it more because I am usually talked about as being difficult, in 
the same way."  
</P>
<P>
 Rourke also applauded Dunaway for daring to be ugly in "Barfly." "This wasn't 
this leading lady type; she had to play a character who didn't have very much 
makeup on, one who wasn't really glamorous. She was secure about that; it was 
sort of a bold chance she took. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is, like, one of the last true movie stars. Faye Dunaway has been a movie 
star since 'Bonnie and Clyde.' . . . She's a big screen actress, and she always 
will be." 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Tewkesbury, who did a rewrite for Dunaway on the 1978 film "Eyes of Laura 
Mars" and directed "Cold Sassy Tree," said that "both as a director and as a 
writer, you are thrilled to have someone who will go to the mat for a shared 
vision. Her work was fine -- there were no problems once the rules of the game 
were laid out, that you have a very short shooting schedule for TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "What people call difficult -- the same thing happens with Streisand -- any of 
the women who come through the difficulties of this business, and God knows 
they have had to endure all kinds of experiences, have very rigorous criteria 
of who they are, and how they are going to do it. And they have done it for 
some of the best people in the business." 
</P>
<P>
 As for that unpleasant Polanski period, Tewkesbury said, rather cryptically, 
"That was a very difficult time in her life. People are allowed to go through 
their passages; God knows, everybody has them. These women are called upon to 
be incredibly strong, and sometimes you just can't do it that day, or that 
month or that week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actors have a great regard for Faye; they understand the struggle, and the 
baggage that comes with being a celebrity." 
</P>
<P>
 Was Dunaway, then, a terror in the early days of her career who somehow 
mellowed out during the '80s? "Network" director Sidney Lumet said that, circa 
1976, Dunaway was "a joy to work with. She's a completely creative actor; she 
is brave, she is fearless, she is true to the character. She doesn't worry 
about whether it's sympathetic or not sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard she was difficult before we started, and she just wasn't. It just 
never happened. I'm not hiding anything from you. I do know that, in some 
instances, when these kinds of reputations develop, it's because the actor is 
working with people who don't know as much about their work as the actor does. 
That's the one thing that the actor needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Lumet: "I think, generally, that people are always surprised that such 
an incredible beauty has that much talent. Usually there is that kind of 
condescending thing, especially for actresses -- assuming, looking at a 
beautiful woman, that she can't have any brains. And there she is. She's 
beautiful, and she can act."  
</P>
<P>
 Even though Dunaway will never quite come right out and say she was ever . . . 
difficult, she will guardedly acknowledge that perfectionism can sometimes be 
misinterpreted -- and that, over the years, she has come to more easily accept 
human flaws.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in the business of trying to achieve something wonderful, and so you use 
all of your wit and courage and mind and try to make it special," she said. "I 
mean, that's what art is -- that's what people come to movies or the theater 
for, to see something special. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say that you only grow through trial and error. And I believe that. You 
only grow by doing something wrong. So, anyway, I feel that I am at a place 
where I'm the best I've ever been, hopefully, for my mind, my emotions and the 
way I live my life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that what I wanted at this moment in my life was some material that I 
really cared about . . . something I could sink my teeth into and I could 
really be happy about. And it's very hard work. But I really got more than I 
asked for because I also have to sing. So I just wanted a great big old 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 And, Dunaway added, "You can't fake it to an audience. They have very good 
truth barometers. They don't have an ax to grind, and they're ready to like you 
-- as opposed to sometimes in our (Hollywood) world where there are middlemen 
who say, 'Well, if I'm nice to her, and tell her she's wonderful, I'll get the 
job on her next movie' or something. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nice connection. And it's an honest one."*

 Esperanza Elementary School, which graduated its first class last week, hosted 
a school dedication ceremony May 27 but the joy of the occasion was tempered 
with sadness over the recent death of a student from a nearby school. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberly Lopez, a 7-year-old student at Union Avenue Elementary School, was 
killed May 19 in front of Esperanza's crowded playground at 7th Street and 
Union Avenue. She and her brother, Alan, were struck by a car that was forced 
onto the sidewalk by a hit-and-run driver. Alan, 11, was seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Mike Hernandez, speaking at the Esperanza ceremony, said the 
City Council will offer a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest 
of the hit-and-run driver. Hernandez also promised to get traffic signs and 
crossing guards for Esperanza.  
</P>
<P>
 Kerina Chewning, a teacher at Union Avenue Elementary School, said her school 
is collecting donations to help the Lopez family pay for the funeral, medical 
expenses and counseling. Donations can be sent to the Union Avenue Relief Fund, 
150 Burlington Ave., Los Angeles 90057. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kimberly was a wonderful child, a consistently thoughtful student who was 
always concerned with helping other children," Chewning said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Esperanza's 800 students, like pupils at other nearby schools, walk to 
and from their schools, crossing busy streets and navigating alleys where drug 
sales and use are common. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowena Lagrosa, Esperanza's principal, hoped the tragedy would bring the 
community closer together to confront "the daily challenges" faced by students 
from families with limited financial resources and, in many cases, limited 
English-speaking ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dedication of a school is much more than a dedication of new buildings," 
Lagrosa said. "It's about a vision and philosophy that collectively develops as 
committed individuals make dreams become reality. . . . May the beauty of 
Kimberly's life live in our hearts forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Melissa Calito, a fifth-grader who will be moving on to middle school this 
fall, said her teachers at Esperanza boosted her confidence, polished her 
public-speaking skills, and combined education and fun in the school garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where I first learned about giving speeches," said Melissa, who was 
one of several student speakers at the ceremony. "But of all my good 
experiences here I'll remember the garden the most." JAKE DOHERTY

 A new promotion by the Radisson Wilshire Plaza Hotel to drum up lunchtime 
business for its restaurant during noisy subway construction will also benefit 
Wilshire Center churches and nonprofit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel's Tulips Garden Restaurant offers a 10% discount coupon for its 
Sunday brunch to members of participating churches.At the end of each month, 
the hotel donates 10% of the members' purchases back to the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at it as a positive way to help keep the hotel afloat during Metro 
Rail construction while also giving something back to the community," said 
Robert Mooney, the hotel's director of public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunday Brunch Community Discount Program began this month and so far 
includes St. Basil's Catholic Church, Immanuel Presbyterian Church, Wilshire 
Christian Church and the First Congregational Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's wonderful for them to take that kind of initiative," said Linda 
Rees, administrator at Immanuel Presbyterian. "As a church we're trying to find 
more ways to interact with the community and use our own facilities to the 
maximum. So it's great to see (the hotel) also being very creative in helping 
themselves and the community." JAKE DOHERTY

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: BELL GARDENS; CITY OPENS OFFICE FOR JOB REFERRALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 People usually stop by City Hall to pick up a dog license or a building 
permit, but now Bell Gardens residents can go there to search for a job. 
</P>
<P>
 With assistance from their neighbors in Commerce, Bell Gardens officials last 
week celebrated the opening of a job referral office for residents. The effort 
is designed to help reduce joblessness in the city, where unemployment is 
almost twice the national average. 
</P>
<P>
 The office in the basement of City Hall is linked by computer to a job list 
compiled by the City of Commerce, which has been operating its own referral 
service for more than a dozen years and has placed about 500 people in jobs 
every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Adriana Ulloa, senior administrative analyst in Bell Gardens, says that when 
doors swung opened Wednesday, the jobs office had 54 positions to dole out. A 
dozen more job openings were expected every day, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have already gotten calls from people who want to know when we are 
opening," Ulloa said a day before the office opened. In preparation for the 
opening, Ulloa said, the three-member staff worked feverishly to locate jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the jobs available through the city's office are clerical, warehouse, 
or sales positions and pay at least minimum wage and up to $16 per hour, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unemployment rate in Bell Gardens, a city of 43,000, is about 13%, Ulloa 
said. According to 1993 statistics from the state Department of Finance, the 
median family income in the city was $23,819. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are working hand-in-hand (with Commerce) to try to break the cycle of 
poverty," Ulloa said.  
</P>
<P>
 Ulloa said the office was necessary because many Bell Gardens residents had a 
difficult time finding transportation to Commerce to make use of that city's 
job referral office. Commerce officials decided to help establish the Bell 
Gardens office so that the two cities will not have to compete against each 
other in the job market. 
</P>
<P>
 "For them to develop something brand new, it would take five to seven years . 
. . and they would compete with us," said Robert Chavez, social services 
manager in the City of Commerce. "We proposed that instead of competing, 
wouldn't it be a brighter idea to expand the current service to help out Bell 
Gardens residents?" 
</P>
<P>
 Now for the first time, unemployed residents in Bell Gardens can make an 
appointment locally to see a public employment counselor. Ulloa said that it 
only takes about 15 minutes for people to add their names and other relevant 
information to the computerized list. Like a dating service, the computer 
matches the applicant's skills with job openings in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the new computer system in Bell Gardens can print a polished 
resume for each job seeker who uses the free service. 
</P>
<P>
 "The immediate goal is to get people jobs," Ulloa said. "But we (eventually) 
want to help them develop careers."  
</P>
<P>
 The city also wants to create programs that teach applicants how to act in a 
job interview, get along in the workplace and maximize skills to earn a living. 
</P>
<P>
 Collecting names of unemployed workers is only half the battle. The city is 
also hoping to establish its service in the regional business community. Chavez 
said that businesses from as far as Orange County have contacted the referral 
office in Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that everyone wants to work," Chavez said. "This is putting meat and 
potatoes on the table."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: BELL GARDENS; NEW CLINIC TO OFFER AFFORDABLE CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When many local residents get sick, they say, they cross their fingers and 
hope they will get better tomorrow, or they trek all the way to Tijuana for 
inexpensive medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But within days they will need only go as far as Gage and South Garfield 
avenues for affordable care.  
</P>
<P>
 The Family Planning Centers of Greater Los Angeles will soon open a Family 
Medical Center at 6501 S. Garfield Ave. Patients will be charged on a sliding 
scale, based on what they can afford, and clinic staff members expect that most 
people with Medi-Cal benefits will not be asked to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic is scheduled to open this week or next, pending the approval of 
state health inspectors and fire inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 With little time left to prepare, the staff was working last week around 
unopened boxes and unassembled chairs. No signs were on the freshly painted 
walls, only scraps of paper taped to doors identifying which room was which. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a big need here," said Susan Stemmler, executive director of the 
Family Planning Centers of Greater Los Angeles and the driving force in getting 
the local clinic open. "For a lot of people, health care is the last priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Stemmler and others said that the city's poorer residents typically shun 
local, traditional health care because it is too expensive, or they seek 
temporary relief from relatives who profess to know a thing or two about herbs 
or massages. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just don't know how to access health care," she said. "Or they have 
gotten burned by places offering free tests (such as pregnancy tests) only to 
walk out with a huge bill that they cannot manage." 
</P>
<P>
 Stemmler said there are few private doctors in town and a county-run health 
facility is overcrowded. "With such poverty rates," Stemmler said. "the 
(population) just can't support physicians." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Gardens has an unemployment rate of about 13%, which is almost double the 
national average. According to the Los Angeles County Department of Health 
Services, its teen pregnancy rate is among the highest in California. There is 
also a formidable problem with communicable diseases because many children have 
not been immunized, Stemmler said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a sister clinic in South Gate, where some Bell Gardens residents currently 
go, Stemmler said, children as old as 7 receive shots that should have been 
given when they were infants. "The biggest problems in the area are pediatric 
services and prenatal care," Stemmler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new clinic is in a building that four years ago was an industrial medical 
center.  
</P>
<P>
 The clinic will employ 17 or 18 people, including a family physician, a 
pediatrician and a nurse practitioner. Another nurse in training will join the 
staff this month and Stemmler is trying to arrange for specialists from 
regional hospitals to rotate through the clinic. In the first year, the clinic 
is anticipating 100 patients per day. 
</P>
<P>
 Stemmler said the clinic will take appointments and walk-ins and will be open 
weekdays during business hours and on Saturday. There will be 17 examination 
rooms, including pediatrics, prenatal care, dentistry and X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it relies on government subsidies, not all services will be available 
on opening day, Stemmler said. The most urgent needs will be answered first, 
and such things as dental service and eye exams will come later, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Magda Endara, a counselor, and Estela Herrera, a medical assistant, were both 
transferred from the South Gate clinic to the one in Bell Gardens.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people already know we are here," Herrera said. "And one person will 
tell another and another. That is the way it works." BOB ELSTON

 The Operation Hope Vision Center, a consortium of loan officers from several 
banks seeking to increase home loans in the inner city, opened here last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, at Degnan Boulevard and 43rd Street in the Vision Center theater 
complex, will offer alternatives to people turned down for loans at traditional 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Staffed with loan officers from four lending institutions -- Fidelity Federal 
Bank, First Federal Bank of California, First Republic Thrift and Loan and 
South Pacific Thrift and Loan -- the center will work with first-time buyers to 
establish good credit. Home loans are virtually assured for clients willing to 
stick to a financial plan outlined by loan officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lance Triggs, the center's executive director, says the unique component of 
the program is case management. Clients who do not initially qualify go through 
six to 12 months of home buyer workshops, financial counseling and one-on-one 
mentoring to work up to a point where they can qualify for a loan. Credit 
portfolios will be established by looking at payment history of rent, utility 
and bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Triggs said the unusual lending approach is all in the spirit of encouraging 
banks to look at a total picture before assuming a prospective buyer is a bad 
risk. "It's a fact that home loan defaults in the inner city are among the 
lowest anywhere," he said. "We want banks to not just identify problems, but 
also solutions. We don't want people to feel intimidated or cross-examined, as 
they often do in banks."  
</P>
<P>
 Loans will be funded by the Vision Fund, a "safety net" fund pool set up by 
the four participating institutions. Open only a week, the center has already 
approved loans for seven clients, Triggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is the brainchild of 27-year-old businessman and Operation Hope 
nonprofit foundation founder John Bryant. Bryant said he conceived the idea 
last year after realizing that lack of home ownership is a chief reason people 
feel they have little stake in their community. Triggs said he and Bryant, a 
longtime friend, believe it was no accident that virtually no homes burned 
during the civil unrest of 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 "You don't burn that which you own," said Triggs, who plans to recruit clients 
through churches, local businesses and grass-roots organizations. "Homes in 
many ways are the bedrock of a community. We want to provide people with the 
opportunity to have something that will be an asset in more ways than one."

 After a year and a half of hard work, a group of Dorsey High students have 
turned a neglected patch of their athletic field into an unlikely field of 
greens -- as well as potatoes, watermelon, herbs and other fruits and 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, students and local dignitaries celebrated the spring harvest in the 
garden with a spread including lemonade, chips and home-grown salsa. Once a 
practice spot for shotputters, the corner of Dorsey's track stadium is now 
fertile ground, thanks to the efforts of special education teacher Rene Klein 
and volunteers from the University of California's Cooperative Extension. 
</P>
<P>
 "My special-ed kids love the garden," said Klein, who supervises about 25 
students who tend the garden each week. "It's success-oriented, very 
therapeutic. . . . they've been really great with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite having handicaps ranging from mild learning disabilities to autism, 
students have faithfully tended the small plots since September, 1992. Klein 
received about $2,800 in grant money from Toyota, Philips Petroleum and the Gas 
Co. for the garden, as well as equipment and volunteer donations from the 
nonprofit Common Ground garden program, C & S Nursery, Raindrip Inc., the state 
Department of Conservation and the city Environmental Affairs Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein said the greatest asset has been Elaine Miller, a volunteer with the 
University of California-sponsored Cooperative Extension, the agricultural 
equivalent of the UC extension program. Miller has worked closely with the 
students since the beginning, when the land, with too little topsoil to grow 
even weeds, had to be rehabilitated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to emphasize growing from seed so that students can really see the 
growing process," Miller said. "Students get their own beds or plots, and take 
responsibility for them. Once things are picked, they also learn how to share." 
</P>
<P>
 The land, with its brightly painted sign proclaiming the "Dorsey High Student 
Garden," is next to Rodeo Road near La Brea Avenue, and school officials warned 
Miller that the garden would be a target for vandals. But such fears were never 
realized, and Klein and her crew have begun building a roofed patio and 
erecting an arbor that will soon be covered with grapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest obstacle has been getting the water irrigation system in place," 
said Klein, "but now we're just fine." ERIN J. AUBRY

 The federal Department of Transportation awarded $100,000 to Cal State Los 
Angeles last week for an 18-month program to increase the number of minority 
students in the transportation field. The program will begin in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The award was one of eight in the country given to schools with large Latino 
enrollments. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will enable the university to provide internships to about 10 
students who will receive special training in transportation-related careers, 
said Hassan Hashemian, a professor in transportation engineering in the 
department of civil engineering.  
</P>
<P>
 The university will also design a lecture series for these students, bringing 
in professionals in government and from the private sector to discuss the 
latest in transportation technology. The grant will allow students to work with 
agencies and businesses while they are in training. 
</P>
<P>
 It also provides for Hashemian to act as a consultant to these businesses to 
help increase the number of minority employees trained in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are going to go through a certain type of training, education and 
experience, and they get paid for it," Hashemian said. "It's very good for the 
students, especially for minority students because transportation is booming 
these days. The defense conversion is going into transportation, and we feel 
the work force of the future is the minority work force." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the project, the eight institutions selected nationwide will develop and 
implement educational programs aimed at making disadvantaged business 
enterprises more competitive in their search for transportation-related 
contracts.  
</P>
<P>
 "This program will combine the efforts of government, HIS (Hispanic Serving 
Institutions) and the private sector to foster diversity in educational 
opportunities for college students in the field of transportation," said U.S. 
Transportation Secretary Federico Pena. "It also will promote greater 
participation of disadvantaged business enterprises in transportation-related 
contracts."  
</P>
<P>
 Cal State L.A. has also recently received $85,000 in grants from Caltrans and 
the federal government to increase the number of minorities involved in 
transportation, Hashemian said. The students will be trained in computer-aided 
design and engineering.

 Roberto R. Valdivia never imagined that answering a mailer about a program 
designed to increase student awareness of other cultures would result in a trip 
abroad.  
</P>
<P>
 Much to his surprise, the 16-year-old Cathedral High School honor student has 
bought his first suitcase and plans to leave this month on a 23-day trip to 
Washington, London, Paris, Lyon, France and Geneva with 30 other area students 
and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 They are part of the People to People Student Ambassador Program, which takes 
American students abroad to study other cultures, industries and governments. 
They will be staying with host families for part of their visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdivia's group, which will be studying international mass media, plans 
visits to the British Broadcasting Corp. in London and to newspapers in the 
other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to learn how other media operates in other countries," said Roberto, 
his black hair tied in a short ponytail. "I'm the type of person who likes to 
do a lot of different things, so in case I don't like journalism, I'll be able 
to find something else I like." 
</P>
<P>
 The program evaluates students' grades, community activities and teacher 
recommendations, and interviews are conducted before selections are made, said 
Janet Beach, a Cerritos High School journalism teacher who will accompany the 
group abroad. About 100 students were interviewed for the 30 slots.  
</P>
<P>
 "They get to travel with other young people, and we have orientation meetings 
that give them background information on the cultures and languages (they will 
encounter)," Beach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto, who writes for his high school paper, The Phantom Times, has learned 
that chewing gum in Britain is considered rude and that it is customary to 
bring a small gift to people you visit in France. He said he is learning to say 
please and thank you in several languages, "so we don't embarrass ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The students can also earn high school or college credit if they meet certain 
requirements, such as keeping a journal or making a photo presentation about 
their trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto, who has raised $2,000 of the necessary $5,000 from friends and 
relatives and by holding a dinner, borrowed the balance from his mother, Maria 
Valdivia.

TOPPLING THE MADISON AVENUE GIANTS; SMALLER, MORE CREATIVE AD AGENCIES, 
COMBINED WITH A SMART AUDIENCE, THREATEN THE BIG GUYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

has written about advertising and the media for Advertising Age, the New York 
Times Magazine and GQ.

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than two years ago, Rick Ender, an award-winning creative director with a 
small advertising agency in Atlanta, was hired by Madison Avenue's largest ad 
agency, McCann-Erickson. His mission: To create commercials for what may be the 
world's most famous brand, Coca-Cola. "It was a chance to do something really 
big," says the soft-spoken Ender. Or so it seemed at the time.  
</P>
<P>
 In the months that followed, Ender realized he'd stepped into advertising 
hell. Coca-Cola had set up an agonizing internal competition that pitted 
McCann-Erickson, its faithful U.S. marketing partner of 40 years, against 
Michael Ovitz, head of the high-powered Hollywood talent firm Creative Artists 
Agency. To make matters worse, CAA was clearly winning the battle by the time 
Ender joined McCann. Worse still, Ender could see why McCann was losing but 
could do nothing about it. "It was like a maze at McCann-Erickson," he says. "A 
lot of bureaucracy, a lot of infighting. The best ideas weren't getting 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 Those problems became apparent to the world in February, when Coca-Cola held a 
press conference in New York to unveil its slate of Coke Classic commercials 
for 1994. After it was over, McCann-Erickson executives must have felt like the 
kid in the schoolyard pickup game who is chosen dead-last. Coke executives 
played 30 commercials for the crowd; 27 were made by CAA, two by the small 
Minneapolis agency Fallon McElligott -- and just one by McCann-Erickson. 
</P>

 By that time, Ender was already gone, having resigned a couple of months 
earlier. He is now running his own small ad agency back in Atlanta. "I wanted 
to return to the reason I went into this business, which was to make good 
advertising," he says. Would he ever consider going to work for one of the big 
New York agencies again? "No," Ender says emphatically. "Never again." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, there are more than a few New York advertising people who might 
want to join Ender in heading for the hills. Turmoil has become a way of life 
on Madison Avenue. The ad business has lost more than 13,500 jobs in the past 
three years, clients such as Coke have been defecting from Madison Avenue, and 
anxiety has been running high at the large, top-name agencies -- the companies 
that, for 40 years, helped fuel the economy and shape the popular culture. "The 
big agencies are becoming dinosaurs," says Donny Deutsch, head of the 
lean-and-mean New York upstart agency Deutsch Inc., which has swiped accounts 
from the likes of Ogilvy & Mather and talent from McCann-Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
 The threats come from all sides, from clients demanding better results from 
their advertising; from imaginative, smaller competitors such as Deutsch, CAA 
and regional ad agencies, all hungry for a piece of the $138-billion U.S. 
advertising pie; from today's television viewer, who appears to be more immune 
to conventional commercials than ever before, and from new technology, which 
promises to reinvent the very process of advertising.  
</P>
<P>
 Madison Avenue's troubles began during the economic recession of the late 
1980s, immediately following a wave of merger mania that had fattened up the 
business. Clients began to trim ad spending and many turned to cost-effective 
marketing alternatives, such as coupons and direct mail. By the early '90s, 
advertising had lost 25% of its market share to other forms of promotion. "The 
whole relationship between clients and agencies changed -- marketers began to 
look for many different ways to promote, other than just commercials," says 
Philip Guarascio, general manager of marketing and advertising at General 
Motors Corp.  
</P>
<P>
 A blizzard of pink slips began at the big ad houses in 1990, and the slump 
worsened in 1991, the first year in two decades that U.S. ad spending decreased 
from the previous year. The effects could be felt beyond New York, at ad 
agencies throughout the country; L.A. ad agencies have been "in a state of 
panic the last couple of years," says Anita Santiago, on the board of directors 
of the Western States Advertising Agencies Association Inc. (though she notes 
that there's "more optimism this year" among L.A. agencies, which may be 
attributable to a strong first quarter among the Japanese car makers that 
dominate the local ad business.) And it wasn't just ad agencies that suffered: 
A ripple effect could be felt throughout the media world as magazines, 
newspapers and television networks all lost advertising (about 40 magazines 
went out of business during the first two years of the ad slump). 
</P>
<P>
 Though media revenues nationwide also have stabilized and even improved a 
little in the past year, the pressure on agencies has been unrelenting. Clients 
have trimmed commission fees to agencies from the longtime standard of 15% to, 
in some cases, 10% or less. And up and down Madison Avenue, those same 
penny-pinching clients have put their accounts up for review. 
</P>
<P>
 While Coke was drifting toward Hollywood last year, IBM, Burger King, 
MasterCard and Volkswagen switched from large to small agencies. A number of 
other clients, including auto makers BMW and Isuzu and the computer company 
NEC, have abandoned New York advertising to work with regional ad agencies in 
Boston and San Francisco. "More defections from the big agencies will follow," 
predicts industry consultant Richard Roth, who advised Burger King on its 
account switch. "Client companies are fighting harder than ever for market 
share, and they need big ideas." And, with rare exceptions, the big ideas 
haven't been coming from big agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they've been coming from unexpected places. For the past few years 
the advertising culture has been shaped more by a small agency in Portland, 
Wieden & Kennedy, urging consumers to "Just Do It" than by any of the 
multinational, New York-based leviathans. And the top national ad award shows 
now are dominated by agencies from San Francisco, Minneapolis and Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies "basically and fundamentally no longer accept on faith the value of 
conventional advertising placed in conventional media," Allen Rosenshine, 
chairman and CEO of BBDO Worldwide, told the annual meeting of the American 
Association of Advertising Agencies last month. The Madison Avenue powerhouses 
have "finally begun to acknowledge that this isn't a recession we're in, and 
that we're not going to go back to the good old days," says Keith Reinhard, 
chairman and CEO of DDB Needham Worldwide, who has seen his agency's spacious 
New York office become a ghost town as the staff dropped from 1,000 to less 
than 500. "What's become clear," he says, "is that the problems of big agencies 
are systemic, and must be dealt with." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, in what some saw as a sign of desperation, several major agencies 
began to "re-engineer" and restructure themselves, with an emphasis on 
downsizing. This year, the trend is for slumping agencies to replace top 
executives (in one frantic week in April, three powerhouses, Ogilvy & Mather, 
Ayer and Saatchi & Saatchi, all named new CEOs or presidents at their New York 
offices). But Deutsch and others in advertising believe that such thrashing 
about won't remedy a fundamental problem: While the big guys were expanding 
into global giants, he says, they lost touch with their core audience here in 
America. The late '80s and early '90s TV viewer -- armed with remote control, 
VCR, 50 channels and decades' worth of media savvy -- became too smart, too 
quick and too elusive for slow-moving, conventional advertisers.  
</P>
<P>
 The tumult of the past four years may be nothing compared to what's coming. By 
the time advertising's rollicking '90s are over, you may not recognize the 
commercials on your TV, which are likely to be more interactive, more diverse 
and more targeted. Lots of people -- including small, creative agencies such as 
Deutsch, Hollywood agents and producers, infomercial specialists and video-game 
mavens -- will be challenging the New York heavyweights such as 
McCann-Erickson, whose chief weapon, and weakness, is its own immensity.  
</P>
<P>
 THE HIGH-RISE, MID-MANHATTAN OFFICES OF MCCANN-ERICKSON, AN agency that 
creates more than $6.7 billion worth of commercials each year, is a place in 
which slogans abound. Posted on the walls are nearly 80-year-old inspirational 
writings by founder Harrison K. McCann about the higher purposes of advertising 
("To create energy out of facts and words . . . to stir desire and impel 
action"). In the creative department, there are small, hand-held mirrors with 
the words "Creativity is my responsibility" printed on the glass at the bottom 
of each. And there's the agency motto, plastered everywhere you look: "Truth 
Well Told," it declares, serving as evidence that advertisers are capable of 
deceiving themselves, too. 
</P>
<P>
 John Dooner, the 45-year-old, fast-rising executive who has been president of 
McCann since 1992 and who will add the title of CEO this summer, also believes 
in the power of slogans. Sitting in his plush office, the pinstripe-suited 
Dooner is asked about his agenda for leading the world's top agency into a 
period that promises to test McCann's mettle. He pauses for a moment, then 
reaches for a small, pre-printed card upon which he has documented his guiding 
principles. He begins to read from the card, uttering corporate-speak phrases 
about "the power and passion to be the best." If Dooner seems to lack 
spontaneity, he is, in that regard, not entirely out of place at 
McCann-Erickson, an agency that some advertising people call "the factory." 
</P>
<P>
 Dooner is charming except in the face of criticism. Then, he tends toward 
bluntness with a touch of derision. "To talk about the big agencies being in 
trouble is sexy, it makes a good story, but it's bull," he says, noting that 
McCann has steadily added to its accounts, outperforming most of Madison Avenue 
in the 1990s. (Last year, it netted $450 million in new business, and in seven 
of the past eight years, it has been ranked among the top five ad agencies in 
the world in terms of new U.S. business.) Still, what of the layoffs at the big 
agencies and the constant client defections? "People think advertising is alone 
with these problems," he snaps. "It's happening everywhere. IBM is laying off 
thousands of people!" And what about Coca-Cola going to Hollywood for ads? 
Dooner begins to answer, then stops himself. No one at McCann-Erickson is 
supposed to talk about Coca-Cola and CAA, though in truth, some people in the 
industry have been talking about little else. 
</P>
<P>
 To understand how much Coke's romance with CAA hurts McCann, you have to 
consider history. During a period of five decades, McCann helped build Coke 
into one of the world's premier brands, and conversely, Coke helped build 
McCann into the top agency. The collaboration occasionally produced advertising 
magic. Some Coke commercials live on in viewers' memories 20 to 30 years later: 
the chorus on the hilltop, singing "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing," and 
the fearsome football player Mean Joe Greene, who hands over his game jersey to 
a child. The old slogans, including "Things Go Better With Coca-Cola" and "It's 
the Real Thing," were no less memorable. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, from McCann and Coke's standpoint, is that it is only the 
20-year-old commercials that come to mind; try to recall a Coke commercial from 
the past five years -- pre-Polar Bear, that is -- and chances are you'll draw a 
blank. It isn't just that the ads have become bland; more to the point, the 
world around McCann has changed. For years, McCann and other big agencies 
turned out "mass-produced, mass-marketed, one-size-fits-all commercials," says 
Don E. Schultz, professor of integrated marketing communications at 
Northwestern University. "But what we've recently discovered is that today's 
consumer is turned off by that and is saying, 'I'm not homogeneous, I'm not 
like the guy down the street.' " As viewer attitudes have changed, so, too, 
have the media, which became more fragmented by cable. "It became harder for 
commercials to have an impact through sheer repetition," says Schultz. Or, as 
Peter Sealey, former global marketing chief at Coca-Cola, puts it: "The days of 
forcing people to sit through obnoxious 'Ring-Around-the-Collar' commercials 
are over." 
</P>
<P>
 Sealey, who has since left Coca-Cola to become head of Interactive Network 
Inc., a new interactive cable TV broadcast network, was at the center of the 
soft-drink company's decision to radically change its advertising two years 
ago. Coke had grown weary of "the blandness coming out of the advertising 
factories, year after year," he says. "Every summer, the agency would present 
me with a commercial of somebody squirting someone else with a hose." And, says 
Sealey, McCann-Erickson clung to the traditional practice of creating broad 
messages for 18-to-34-year-olds, "as if you could run the same ad on MTV as on 
CBS." 
</P>
<P>
 Having previously worked as a president of marketing and distribution at 
Columbia Pictures, Sealey, along with former Coke president Donald Keough, 
believed that Hollywood was more in touch with changes in the popular culture 
than Madison Avenue, and that the Hollywood production system -- which relied 
on independent artists rather than in-house talent -- was more conducive to 
creativity. And so, in early fall of 1991, Coke signed up CAA as a global 
marketing consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 McCann-Erickson knew that war had been declared and began working feverishly 
on a new campaign for Coke, with ideas and suggestions being sent to New York 
from McCann offices around the world. But few ideas survived the agency's 
hierarchical approval process, according to inside sources.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile on the West Coast, there were only two people working on Coke full 
time at CAA -- Len Fink, a former adman from Chiat/Day, and Shelly Hochron, a 
former senior vice president of production at Tri-Star Pictures. Hochron says 
ideas were being generated daily through "a lot of brainstorming with little or 
no formal research." 
</P>
<P>
 In October of 1992, on a day that may well have changed advertising forever, 
the CAA team headed east and the McCann crew headed west for a showdown in a 
Coca-Cola conference room in Atlanta. McCann arrived with a handful of ideas 
that would serve as jumping-off points for multicommercial campaigns. Agency 
executives sat and watched as CAA, led by Ovitz, presented its ideas -- more 
than 30 of them, for individualized commercials. Says one McCann executive who 
was there: "I was blown away by the diversity of CAA's work. We were coming 
from the old school of advertising repetition, which is the way Coke had always 
done things. And here CAA was, breaking the mold. It was very daring of them. 
Of course, they had nothing to lose -- unlike us." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, the CAA ads did not resort to using movie stars from Ovitz's 
stable; that would have been standard ad industry point-and-pitch fare. 
Instead, Hochron says, "our intent was to look completely different -- to be 
more graphically arresting or unusual than anything else on TV." To achieve 
that, CAA wanted to use stylistic film directors and state-of-the-art visual 
techniques, such as computer-generated animation. "As soon as we saw what CAA 
was presenting, we felt it was fresh and compelling," Sealey says. As the CAA 
presentation was ending -- before McCann had shown a single idea to Coke -- one 
McCann executive at the table, John Bergin, slipped a note to another sitting 
next to him. It read: "We are dead." But the other executive responded, "No, 
we're not." 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out that Bergin was right. Not only did CAA win the shootout (24 CAA 
ads were approved, compared to two of McCann's), but its work also seemed to 
score a hit with the public -- particularly one commercial featuring an 
animated, herky-jerky polar bear, which simply looked like nothing else on TV. 
Though Sealey was ousted last fall after Coke's president retired, any hopes 
that McCann may have had for reinstatement were dashed when Sergio Zyman, 
Sealey's replacement, selected another full slate of CAA ads earlier this year, 
some featuring the polar bear. He announced that the first batch helped 
increase Coke's market share for the first time in years and tapped several 
regional agencies, including Portland's Wieden & Kennedy, Venice's Chiat/Day 
and Minneapolis' Fallon McElligott to work on Coke ads. The unspoken message 
from Coke: If we want fresh ideas, we'll have to look beyond Madison Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 While it might seem odd that a tiny group of outsiders could sucker punch a 
global marketing heavyweight like McCann, it demonstrates that good ideas can 
come from anywhere. An agency's success is ultimately dependent on tiny 
creative sparks, on the ability of an art director and a copywriter, sitting in 
a room together, to find an original, striking way to convey an otherwise banal 
message. But at McCann and many other big agencies, the ideas that emerge from 
that room must pass through a half-dozen or more layers of approval within the 
agency's hierarchy. "Ideas don't rise to the top in an environment that 
massive," says Ender, who notes that his best schemes for Coke at McCann never 
saw the light of day. Those ideas that do manage to pass from one layer to the 
next "get altered and watered down at each stop; what you end up with lacks the 
freshness of the original idea," says Bill Oberlander, an award-winning art 
director at McCann who is now at the smaller kirshenbaum & bond in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 McCann's top creative director, Marcio Moreira, is keenly aware of the plague 
of bureaucracy and says he is attempting to reduce the number of "operating 
levels" at McCann. Its chief, meanwhile, seems less sympathetic. Dooner notes 
that creative people are paid great sums of money -- as much as $300,000 a year 
-- to join McCann-Erickson and to perform in the big leagues. "This is a 
business we're in, and our whole purpose is to be big," Dooner says. "If you 
want to be an artist, move to SoHo." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Dooner acknowledges that the agency needs more creativity and says he 
plans to "acquire" more talent to that end, he also contends that there may be 
too much creative flash in the kind of advertising that wins awards and strives 
hard to entertain. "Advertising's fundamental purpose is to sell," he says, 
adding that "we tend to lose sight of that as viewers and critics of it. 
Advertising has to provide reasons to purchase." 
</P>
<P>
 McCann's own commercials put forth those selling propositions in a workmanlike 
fashion. For L'Oreal hair coloring, actress Cybill Shepherd gazes into the 
camera and talks earnestly about the advantages of having beautiful hair; for 
Alka-Seltzer, there's a bouncy jingle about getting through a tough day ("Get 
Yourself Some Alka-Seltzer/ And You'll Feel Better Fast!"). The production 
values are flawless, the jingles are even a little catchy. Ten years ago, 
McCann's brand of functional advertising -- supported by a big media budget and 
a lot of repetition -- was more than adequate. But that was before 
channel-surfing and remote-control mute buttons came along and put advertisers 
under the thumb of the average couch potato. Today, says Northwestern's 
Schultz, advertisers must find ways to attract a viewer "who is no longer 
captive," and that necessitates taking creative risks -- an uncommon practice 
at agencies such as McCann, but a way of life at Deutsch. 
</P>
<P>
 A FEW MONTHS AGO, DONNY DEUTSCH WAS SITTING IN HIS DOWNTOWN New York office, 
with its indoor basketball hoops and miniature pinball machine, when members of 
his creative team brought him an idea for Ikea furniture stores, a client. The 
plan was to show a live-in couple shopping for furniture. Nothing unusual there 
-- except that this couple would be composed of two men. Deutsch thought about 
it for a moment; no one, to his knowledge, had done a gay-lifestyle network TV 
commercial for a mainstream company. That made it all the more appealing. "It 
just felt right in my gut," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequently, there were no review meetings, no research sessions; Deutsch 
took the idea straight to the client, who approved it. As the commercial, which 
showed the two men joking with one another about the act of buying furniture 
and its implications for long-term personal relationships, began airing in 
April, it generated a large splash of publicity. Ikea's investment in the ad 
was multiplied many times over by free exposure in the media. Clients are 
usually surprised when this happens, but not Ikea -- it's used to the way Donny 
Deutsch works. 
</P>
<P>
 If there's any ad agency in New York that could be said to have been designed 
for the early 1990s -- a time when consumers are tuning out sales pitches and 
responding only to that which seems startling and authentic -- it may be 
Deutsch, run by the irrepressible, 36-year-old Donny Deutsch. While much of New 
York advertising has been starving for attention and clients, Deutsch has had 
no shortage of either.  
</P>
<P>
 In the past two years, Prudential Securities, Lenscrafters opticians, 
Tanqueray gin, Hardee's fast-food chains and a half-dozen other clients -- 
totaling $200 million in new business and bringing the overall billings of 
Deutsch's agency to $300 million -- have joined Deutsch. They did so primarily 
because the agency's commercials "break through and reach people on a gut 
level," says Deborah Callahan, Tanqueray's vice president, product group 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say the gut feeling you get from a Deutsch ad will necessarily 
be pleasant. In fact, some of the agency's commercials border on the offensive. 
One, for Pontiac cars, took a swipe at growing Japanese ownership in America 
with a snide reference to New York's Rockefeller Center as "Mitsubishi Center." 
Other Deutsch ads have poked fun at American icons such as Disney World and 
Nike sneakers ("Your mother wears Nike," cried one Deutsch ad for a competing 
shoe, British Knights, in an attempt to plant the kiss of sneaker death -- 
uncoolness -- on the top brand). 
</P>
<P>
 Stylistically, Deutsch's advertising is practically the antithesis of that 
produced by McCann-Erickson. Where McCann's ads are smooth and polished, 
Deutsch's are rough around the edges -- usually shot on a low budget, starring 
quirky "real people" instead of professional actors. In place of jingles and 
sales pitches, there is seemingly spontaneous dialogue and action, so that some 
ads resemble a documentary more than a commercial. Sly humor is usually a 
central element, and the commercials' subjects are often the recipients of 
Deutsch's darts. The company helped introduce the concept of Ikea, a self-serve 
furniture store with few salespeople or deliverers, by filming clips of other 
stores' salespeople, who spouted inane pitches, and their deliverymen, who took 
seemingly endless breaks. "Who needs these guys?" the commercials asked 
viewers.  
</P>
<P>
 Deutsch's "reality-style" advertising is seen by some in the business as a 
gimmick, but Deutsch contends that most consumers today grew up bombarded by TV 
commercials and "can't be fooled by the old 30-second song-and-dance." They 
want their TV "raw and real," he says, as evidenced by the success of 
"Roseanne," "Seinfeld" and "Court TV." Like those programs, his advertising 
strives to "hold up a mirror," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the mirror Deutsch holds up reflects what he wants you to see. In fact, it 
could be argued that Deutsch's advertising, which simulates reality better than 
conventional commercials, is, in fact, a more subtle form of dishonesty. The 
agency scours malls and playgrounds for quirky "real people," then coaches them 
for maximum authenticity. People are sometimes recorded speaking off-the-cuff 
for extended periods of time, then their comments are edited down to make a 
commercial that only seems spontaneous. It's cynical advertising for a cynical 
generation of TV viewers. And Deutsch isn't the only one doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Nike's agency, Wieden & Kennedy, mastered the art of faux honesty several 
years ago; it trashed the sales pitch and began speaking "candidly" to viewers, 
acknowledging with a wink that Nike shoes don't really enable you to jump like 
endorser Michael Jordan. More recently, New York's kirshenbaum & bond has also 
taken a "realistic" approach in its tongue-in-cheek, documentary-style ads for 
Snapple soft drinks, featuring offbeat Snapple customers. "These ads are an 
admission to viewers that most advertising has no credibility," says Anthony 
Vagnoni, editor of Creativity, a spinoff by Advertising Age. "They're 
attempting to stand apart, to ring true amid all those commercials that seem so 
false." (According to a recent survey in Adweek magazine, consumers are more 
jaded about ads than ever, with only 34% of respondents saying they trust ads; 
among the 18-24 set, only 23% trust ads). 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Vagnoni says, such commercials are attempting to engage in a new 
"smart dialogue" with cynical viewers. What sets apart the advertising of 
Deutsch and other rising-star agencies (including kirshenbaum & bond, Wieden & 
Kennedy and San Francisco's Goodby Silverstein & Partners) is not so much a 
particular style as an approach -- one that soft-sells and relies on wit and 
ingenuity.  
</P>
<P>
 The tactic is clearly working for Deutsch Inc., which has more than tripled in 
size since Donny, who began his career as a disillusioned account executive at 
Ogilvy & Mather, took the reins at his father's small, 20-year-old agency. The 
outspoken Deutsch is not well-loved by his peers, who have dubbed him 
"Madonny." With his touches of artifice (born and bred on the streets of 
Queens, he is never seen without his cowboy boots), his tendency to boast 
("we're the only agency in the business that truly balances creativity and 
sound strategy," he claims), and his insatiable appetite for attention (when 
told he'd be in this story, Deutsch immediately asked: "Is it a cover story?"), 
Deutsch's personality sometimes combines the worst elements of advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath the bluster, he has what one former employee describes as "a terrific, 
natural instinct for picking ideas" that resonate with the public. And having 
never had the luxury of Madison Avenue's big-budget campaigns, Deutsch has 
learned how to make the most of minimal access to consumers. His enticing 
commercials, for now at least, represent the better mousetrap that Madison 
Avenue seems to need.  
</P>
<P>
 For all of those cutting-edge tendencies, however, the agency of the moment 
may not necessarily be the agency of the future. Deutsch must contend not only 
with its own growth pains (internal pressures led Deutsch's business partner, 
Steve Dworin, to resign earlier this year), but also with changes in 
advertising for which even his agency seems ill-prepared. For instance, when 
the loquacious Donny is asked about interactive advertising, a miracle occurs: 
He is at a loss for words. 
</P>
<P>
 "THINK OF A MAN ON A FLYING TRAPEZE," SAYS DDB NEEDHAM'S REINHARD. "Right now, 
the ad business is between trapezes. It's scary, because we don't even know 
what the world of advertising is going to look like in a few years." 
</P>
<P>
 We have a few clues, however. This year, Time Warner will begin an interactive 
television test in Orlando, Fla., while a similar interactive TV test program 
is being launched by AT&T and Viacom in Castro Valley, Calif. Viewers in these 
test markets will be equipped with an interactive TV channel through which they 
can order entertainment, information, services -- and advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would anyone request advertising? For a payoff. Companies on these 
channels will offer incentives to entice you to watch their long-form 
commercials. They may provide you with discounted or free merchandise, or they 
may offer a different kind of swap: If you watch our ad, we'll let you watch a 
TV program that we own.  
</P>
<P>
 Once you agree to watch an interactive ad from, say a car company, here's what 
you might see: The ad opens with a showroom full of cars. Using a 
point-and-click device, you point to one of the cars; a short video clip comes 
on, showing the car in action. Then the ad begins to ask you questions. Do you 
want to know more about the car's gas mileage? Would you like to hear from a 
few satisfied customers? Just push a button and the appropriate clip pops up. 
At the end of the process, a brochure or a rebate coupon spews out of the 
printer beside your TV (with lower-priced products, you'll be able to place an 
order if you like). 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner expects to roll out its network nationwide in about five years. 
That may be optimistic, considering that there have been some start-up delays, 
but there's little doubt that interactive TV is, as Chrysler marketing director 
Jim Julow says, "on its way, and coming in a hurry." Already, the first 
generation of interactive ads can be seen on some home computer screens, with 
on-line networks such as Prodigy running ads that enable users to click on 
their computer screen for detailed information from advertisers. As computers 
and TVs converge in the new media world, this simple interaction will become 
more visually stimulating and more sophisticated. It also will, says Bruce 
Judson, Time Inc.'s general manager of multimedia products and services, 
"irrevocably change the relationship between marketers and consumers." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is simple. For perhaps the first time in ad history, the viewer 
will be in control, deciding which ads they want to see, then navigating 
through them. Advertisers, in turn, will have to create ads differently. 
"Instead of trying to bombard you with a slogan, we'll have to figure out what 
kind of information you really want and how to present that information in 
stages, to lead you through the process," says Peter Farago of New York's 
Farago Advertising, which will be making ads for a client in the Time Warner 
interactive test. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, if old commercials were like bad salesmen screaming a canned pitch at 
you, pushing the same product on everybody, new ads may be more like good 
salesmen who listen and respond to individual needs. Marketers are excited 
about the prospect of interactive ads because they promise to bring more 
accountability to advertising. They will be better able to see -- from your 
responses and your orders -- which pitches and promotions succeed. In some 
cases, they may even quiz you to see if you remember a particular slogan, 
rewarding you with prizes.  
</P>
<P>
 It seems the only people who aren't eager for interactive advertising are the 
large ad agencies, to whom it represents "yet another threat to the established 
way of doing things," says Farago, formerly of J. Walter Thompson. To its 
credit, McCann-Erickson has begun taking the lead, along with Ogilvy & Mather, 
in bringing interactive technology to Madison Avenue. About six months ago, 
McCann formed an interactive division, and in April named a top creative 
director, Marshall Karp, to help develop interactive ads. (McCann has also 
sponsored a number of interactive TV field tests.) But other major agencies 
have yet to take these first steps. 
</P>
<P>
 "With their profit margins so slim, I don't think agencies believe they can 
afford to take the lead on interactivity," says advertising consultant Fred 
Lemont, of New York's Grammercy Marketing Corp. "But it's also partly denial: 
In the past, agencies underestimated the impact of VCRs and cable, too. They 
want to stay in the simple world of three networks." Martin Nisenholtz, who 
runs Ogilvy & Mather's decade-old interactive marketing group on Madison 
Avenue, says most agencies "are taking an ostrich-like, hands-off position 
about new media technology. They're not even coming to the table. Meanwhile, a 
lot of small, entrepreneurial companies outside the agency community are 
looking for ways to get a piece of this business." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the new world of advertising may be open to all kinds of ambitious 
outsiders. Aubrey Balkind, of the New York ad agency Frankfurt Balkind 
Partners, points out that the design of interactive ads could offer 
opportunities for video-game creators, who are used to working in a 
quick-response medium. Meanwhile, creators of entertainment programming may 
have an edge, too, because "the distinctions between advertising and 
programming will continue to blur," Balkind says. Is that a Chrysler-sponsored 
show you're watching, or is it an infomercial, or just a long-form commercial? 
It'll get harder and harder to tell the difference, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interactive, hundred-channel world, it will also be increasingly 
critical to target ads to narrow demographic groups. "Where a client once 
needed three commercials, they'll now need 30," says Balkind. And they'll want 
to backstop those commercials with specific sophisticated promotions such as 
"peer-group-influencer programs," wherein a company pays people to go to a 
trendy place and talk up a particular product. "Marketing is going to become 
more and more complex, more specialized," says GM's Guarascio. 
</P>
<P>
 In such a complex, specialized world, what is the role of the ad agency? 
That's the hundred-billion-dollar question being asked on Madison Avenue. 
Dooner thinks he has the best chance of succeeding in this changing world, 
because his company's vast resources and far-flung empire (McCann-Erickson has 
offices in 99 countries) can provide a global Wal-Mart for marketers in the 
midst of the chaos. Dooner repeats the word global like a mantra. "The future 
of advertising is all headed toward multinational and global," he says, leaning 
over at one point to confide, "The U.S. is just the tick on the dog's ass." And 
it is true that so far, at least, most of the multinational brands have stuck 
with big agencies, if only because "it's a place to park all of their global 
business and not worry about it," says consultant Roth. "It's too much of a 
headache to have to deal with different agencies in different countries." Big 
agencies provide other benefits, too. Since they buy advertising space in great 
bulk, they can negotiate for lower rates from the media. 
</P>
<P>
 But those advantages notwithstanding, creativity in advertising -- the 
Achilles' heel for many of the big agencies -- could become increasingly 
important to the multinational clients, particularly if big-brand awareness 
continues to erode here at home. In the past few years, more consumers have 
opted for discounted, private-label brands. To reverse that trend, "companies 
like General Foods will have to come around to creative agencies eventually," 
Deutsch says. A number of big agencies seem to share that view. In the past 
year, DDB Needham, Lintas and other big agencies have broken off pieces of 
themselves to form small, creative spinoff agencies -- initiating a kind of 
merger mania in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 It's possible Dooner and Deutsch may both be wrong. GM's Guarascio foresees a 
future in which agencies of all sizes -- and maybe even interlopers such as CAA 
or interactive technology specialists -- might simultaneously serve the same 
client. "The big agencies have an opportunity to become the general 
contractor," he says. "As we turn to various specialists, who's going to manage 
all of that? The big agency -- if it can change its mind set about ownership." 
Guarascio says the large ad houses must stop trying to do what they don't do 
well. "They can't out-special the specialist," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Guarascio's theory seems to suggest that Dooner operate more like 
a Mike Ovitz, finding the best outside talent for each particular task at hand. 
That might necessitate McCann and other big agencies parceling out various 
parts of the advertising process. For example, the few big agencies that do 
manage to consistently produce highly creative advertising, such as New York's 
BBDO Advertising, might relinquish research or other services. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a metamorphosis, if it ever does come to advertising, would doubtless 
bring more layoffs and general Angst to Madison Avenue. But on the bright side, 
it might mean that an agency such as McCann-Erickson could someday return to a 
Rick Ender, in his small, creative shop in Atlanta, and ask him to do what he 
does best, just to make a good ad. Says Ender, echoing a Coke jingle from 
bygone days, "That's the way it should be."

<P>
 Niaela Smith lightly touches the fingernail-sized scar from the bullet that 
grazed her right temple, a permanent reminder of the violence that has plagued 
the housing projects of Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was riding in a car driven by a gang member when a rival gangster drove 
up alongside and started shooting. But that's part of life in the projects, 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether you hung with gangs or not, you always had to watch your back, 
because even if somebody wasn't trying to get you, you could end up taking a 
bullet meant for someone else, by accident," said Smith, 23. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, that's the way it was before Bloods and Crips factions in Watts laid 
down their AK-47s and 9-millimeter pistols in 1992 and pledged an end to wanton 
killings, some say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the peace treaty," said Smith, whose two younger brothers are Grape 
Street Crips. "The first thing that went through my mind was that there 
wouldn't be any more killing. The peace treaty slowed down a whole lot of 
killing." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, during the bloody feud that loomed between Bloods and Crips in the 
Watts projects, women had been among the targets and victims of rival 
gangsters, or the bystanders who ended up taking a stray bullet. They have also 
been the ones to worry that their sons, brothers or boyfriends would be the 
next casualties of urban warfare.  
</P>
<P>
 Though the killings haven't ceased completely, the 2-year-old truce has eased 
some women's minds. And they pray that the uneasy peace will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what the young men are trying to do (with the truce) is to give us 
back our community, our families," said Theresa Allison, founder of Mothers ROC 
(Reclaiming Our Children), a support group that helps parents of arrested and 
incarcerated young men. 
</P>
<P>
 Mothers who spent sleepless nights waiting for word that their sons had been 
killed now open their homes to truce meetings. Young women who feared their 
children's fathers would be gunned down before the babies took their first 
steps see a brighter future. And teen-age girls who cruised with their homeboys 
welcome peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone plays a role in this truce. It's not just men and can't be 
just men, because these boys have mothers, sisters, wives, girlfriends. They 
have children," Allison said. "We all have a stake in this truce staying 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Women didn't participate in the series of truce meetings held before the civil 
unrest two years ago. Nor were they clamoring before reporters and television 
cameras soon after, pushing for a piece of the American Dream -- economic 
opportunity and political clout. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, they stayed in the background, supporting the 
transformation and efforts of the men who hammered out the peace treaty and 
joining them in celebrating the end of more than a decade of bloody rivalry at 
truce parties and picnics. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was one of the party-goers. It wasn't too long before those parties that 
she and her mother, Deborah, were kept awake almost nightly by the crackle of 
gunfire outside their Jordan Downs apartment. With every round of shots, they 
feared that Fred Smith -- Niaela's brother and Deborah's son -- would be lying 
dead in some street. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Smith talks rather matter-of-factly about her son's gang involvement, 
like someone who has accepted the inevitable. (Another son, Fred's twin brother 
Charles, is also a Grape Street Crip and is in jail.) 
</P>
<P>
 But there are still twinges of a mother's pain in her voice as she recounts 
watching Fred get beaten up during his "courting" into the Crips sect and the 
sleepless nights that added more gray hairs to her head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time it got late I would wonder if he was ever coming home," Smith 
said. "He knew I didn't approve of it, but there wasn't nothing I could do to 
hold him back." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Smith, 22, whose street name is "Scorpio," joined the Grape Street Crips 
at age 11 and spent several years committing drive-bys, robberies and other 
crimes. He has spent eight of the past nine years in and out of jail. Now on 
parole and ready to start a job, he is making some changes that please his 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's got more sense now," she said, watching her son, in purple jeans 
and matching short-sleeved shirt, joke with his friends and flash a boyish, 
dimpled smile at his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can say, since '92, I've rested a lot easier," she said. "That doesn't mean 
everything is perfect, but this part has settled down a bit and that makes it a 
bit better." 
</P>
<P>
 Emma Williams is skeptical that things are better. She admits that the 
killings have subsided since the truce, but the violence continues, she said. 
It is apparent in the quarter-inch hole from a bullet shot through the 
windshield of her son Saffarr's cream-colored Monte Carlo in February. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time when someone was getting shot and killed and people were 
going to funerals every week," she said. "I was so scared one time I was fixing 
to pack up and move." 
</P>
<P>
 "But that was back in the day" before the truce, Niaela Smith interrupted. 
"You've got to admit that things are different now." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams agreed. "The truce made a whole lot of people stop pulling the 
triggers and it seems the death rate has dropped, but I still don't know," she 
said as she sat on the stoop of her Jordan Downs apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 The truce didn't have too much to do with Monique Marshall's decision to 
distance herself from the spiral of gang life that entangled her for nearly a 
third of her 17 years. But it gave her the freedom to move between 
neighborhoods that were closed to her for years because of her involvement with 
a Crips sect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got sick of ducking and dodging from people," said Monique, who is 
focusing her attention on trying to get through high school and raising her 
year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other teens, Monique grew up around Crips in her neighborhood at 
83rd Street near Normandie Avenue. She got caught up in gang life and started 
skipping school, getting drunk, looking for other girls to beat up for money 
and making sure she didn't get beaten up herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel more relaxed now because I can go to picnics and hang with the Bloods 
and stuff and even though they know I'm a Crip, they won't mess with me because 
they know I'm cool," Monique said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nadie Battle, a crisis intervention worker with Community Youth Gang Services, 
worked with Monique and her mother to get the teen out of gang-banging. Girls 
who were heavily involved in gangs "knew it was time to make a change because 
the guys had mellowed out, and so they had nothing to do but mellow out," 
Battle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ex-gangsters and community leaders in the projects and parts of South-Central 
say the truce is holding and moving beyond Watts' boundaries. Members and 
leaders of more than a dozen gang factions that include the Rollin' 60s, 
Eight-Tray Gangsters and Hoover Crips recently announced efforts to call a 
cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, the peace efforts have resulted in a sharp drop in 
gang-related homicides. Between Jan. 1 and May 22, detectives in South Los 
Angeles logged 27 gang-motivated slayings compared with 49 for the same period 
in 1993, a 45% decrease. There were 124 gang-related slayings in South Los 
Angeles in 1993, compared to 126 the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some real genuine people who wanted the peace," said Cmdr. Willie 
Pannell, head of operations in the Los Angeles Police Department's Central 
Bureau. "Particularly some of the mothers and families and some of the guys. 
There was a need for this." 
</P>
<P>
 The police department also reported a decrease in rape and attempted murder in 
the South Bureau, but robberies and felony assaults have increased. 
</P>
<P>
 Between Jan. 1 and April 30 in LAPD's South Bureau, 471 robberies were logged, 
a 58% increase from the 298 reported during the same period last year. There 
were 440 felony assaults during the first four months this year, up from 396 in 
1993. Rapes fell 26% in the two years and attempted murders dropped 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't shooting each other, but they were doing everything else," 
Pannell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Rachal, a former Crip who now works to provide outings for youngsters 
to keep them away from gang life, said "the peace treaty was to stop killing 
each other. That doesn't mean the deaths are gonna stop."  
</P>
<P>
 "To tell a man 'Stop gangbanging,' that's one thing. To tell a man, 'Stop 
gangbanging and stop selling drugs,' that's two different things," said Rachal, 
who works for South-Central L.A. Youth Services, a nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachal's explanation for the continuing violence is what makes Williams of 
Jordan Downs doubtful of the truce's complete success. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fixing to be summer and they're gonna throw parties and somebody is 
gonna say something about someone else's woman and BAM!, it starts all over 
again," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 In the insular housing projects of Watts where the truce was born, a few say 
the peace accord has weakened because the men who worked to put the agreement 
together turned their attention toward having a presence in the media and 
getting funding for their aspiring business ventures or fledgling 
organizations. The result was a failure to make significant efforts to create 
substantial programs to work with the young boys and girls in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we in the (truce) leadership forgot who we were supposed to serve," 
said Fred Williams, founder and director of Common Ground Foundation, a program 
to keep students in school. Williams has been involved in trying to keep the 
truce going and helped organize a national truce summit in Kansas City, Mo., in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "We left these young brothers hanging and they're holding on to what they can 
on their own," he said. So, Williams added, the truce is "fragmented, but it's 
not gone. It's not over." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said he is working on reunifying the frayed factions of the peace 
movement. His idea, the Watts Truce Movement Assn., is still in the planning 
stages and is an attempt to pull various truce organizations together to work 
collectively on various issues. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he doesn't see women playing an integral part in his reunification 
plan. "If the women are gonna be a part of the movement, they're gonna have to 
deal with the girls like we've dealt with the brothers, because the girls start 
some of these problems with the brothers," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several fights between young men in the gangs have been over girls and dicey 
romantic situations, Williams and other community workers said. 
</P>
<P>
 But while male gang members have seen a few efforts and organizations emerge 
since the truce to help keep the peace and help them stay away from 
gangbanging, little has been done in the way of programs specifically for girls 
and young women. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the young men are trying to get their lives together right now and 
once this . . . has taken place, the women are going to have a major role to 
play in helping to keep this all together," said Jim Brown, founder of 
Amer-I-Can, a recovery program for former gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "This generation of girls can be saved. I've seen it done and I've done it 
with a few," said Battle of CYGS. "But they need their own leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 Allison of Mothers ROC said she has played her own part in trying to keep the 
peace. She founded the group in December, 1992, months after her son, Dewayne 
Keith Holmes, was convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison for a 
robbery he says he did not commit. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day, Allison said, she is out on the street talking to teen-age boys, 
gang members or people in Imperial Courts, or she is visiting someone in the 
California Youth Authority or going to court as part of her work with Mothers 
ROC.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think women are the main ingredient in what's needed to help keep this 
going," Allison said, sitting poised at a table in a fast-food restaurant in a 
gray suit jacket and gold blouse with neon orange nail polish. "We were a large 
part of the force that marched through the projects on April 29 to celebrate 
the staying power of the truce. 
</P>
<P>
 "As this (truce) continues, I think we will find a more permanent place in 
helping to continue to this quest for peace," she added. "We can't escape that 
it affects every one of us."

 Architects typically get credit for shaping a city's skyline, but an 
exhibition at the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery suggests that the true 
architects of a city should be the people who live and work in it. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the message of the "Los Angeles Service Station Project," organized by 
architects Christopher Jarrett and Norman Millar and consisting of the works of 
11 architectural teams associated with an ongoing study at USC's School of 
Architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams interviewed residents and community organizations familiar with 
Cudahy, Downtown, East Los Angeles, Jefferson Park, Koreatown, Leimert Park, 
Menlo Avenue, Pico-Union, Skid Row and Watts. Each project focuses on a 
specific issue, such as jobs, education or shelter, and proposes small-scale, 
low-cost responses. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition includes miniature models of community service centers and 
mobile educational, training, recreation and tool-lending facilities.  
</P>
<P>
 Displayed in ways that suggest a bridge between art and architecture, the 
exhibition challenges professionals to collaborate with residents in 
redesigning an environment that puts people's needs first.

REWRITING THE DICTIONARY OF MADNESS; IS THE DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL 
OF MENTAL DISORDERS A WORK OF PURE SCIENCE OR JUST A LIST OF DANGEROUS LABELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ann Japenga, Ann Japenga is a contributing editor for Health magazine. Her 
last story for this magazine was Grunge R Us, a lament for the disappearing 
counterculture. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Patients walk into Peter Breggin's office and lay their diagnoses on the 
couch: They're depressed. They're anxious. They're sure they have a measurable, 
palpable illness, with shape, substance, gravity, consistency. 
</P>
<P>
 "A little boy came in with his parents and I asked him: 'Do you know why 
you're here?' " Breggin says. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Yes. I'm here because you're the doctor who doesn't believe I should take 
Ritalin for my ADHD (attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder).' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, you've got it close," Breggin answered. "I'm the doctor who doesn't 
think you've even got ADHD." 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't surprising the boy was already identifying himself by his mental 
disorder. Psych-speak pervades our culture. Folks bandy about psychiatric 
labels in espresso bars and in school lunchrooms, at supermarkets and on talk 
shows; we diagnose ourselves and we tag each other: I'm manic; you're a little 
obsessive-compulsive. Some of these we pluck from the magazines, others from 
self-help books. Because the labels are so often intoned, they've come to seem 
as substantive as a diagnosis of pneumonia or diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public believes these things are real," says Breggin, director of the 
nonprofit Center for the Study of Psychiatry in Bethesda, Md., and author of 
the soon-to-be-released "Talking Back to Prozac." "They come into my office 
thinking they have 'it.' People scream at me: 'I have clinical depression!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Though everyone seems to believe that mental illnesses have a biochemical 
basis, Breggin points out that no one has ever been able to prove that mental 
illnesses -- such as depression, panic disorder and even schizophrenia -- are 
biological conditions. All the psychiatric community knows is that some 
patients respond to drugs; some mainstream psychiatrists acknowledge that they 
are treating symptoms rather than a quantifiable illness. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you convince (patients) that a bunch of guys just made this stuff up?" 
aks Breggin exasperatedly. "They made it up." The renegade psychiatrist did at 
least manage to convince his young patient that he didn't have an immutable, 
classifiable "it." Says Breggin: "That boy left here singing for the first time 
in months." 
</P>
<P>
 WHEN PETER BREGGIN TELLS PATIENTS THEIR ILLNESSES ARE JUST CONCEPTS some guys 
made up, he's referring to the process by which psychiatric disorders are 
identified and classified, an involved, complicated procedure that began anew 
several years ago. The American Psychiatric Assn. gathered hundreds of 
psychiatrists from around the country to hash out which disorders belong in the 
latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or 
the DSM. (The DSM-IV was scheduled to be unveiled two weeks ago at the national 
APA conference.) 
</P>
<P>
 Often referred to as the bible of psychiatric diagnosis, the DSM defines 
mental illness and shapes notions about normalcy and deviance in the United 
States and around the world. (The previous version, the DSM-III-R, which came 
out in 1987 and revised DSM-III, was translated into 17 languages.) 
Psychiatrists and other physicians, nurses, social workers, psychologists, 
school counselors, insurance companies and courts all turn to the manual to 
give form and a sense of scientific absolutism to the wraithlike feelings that 
assail men and women. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, many have considered psychiatry the squishy, harebrained stepchild 
to real medicine. The public has heard endless squabbling over the nature of 
mental illness. (In fact, within the profession, there are those, like Breggin, 
who believe that so-called mental illnesses are responses to real-life 
situations, and are not biochemically or genetically based, as others believe.) 
The DSM system was created, in part, to clarify and improve psychiatry's image 
by giving mental-health professionals something more substantial to point to 
than Freudian-based psychoanalytic theory. Freudians generally don't take to 
the DSM, but the Freudian era is on the wane and now the keyword is science. 
The profession dearly wants to be regarded as scientific, and, with each new 
edition, it claims a victory for that cause. "More than any other nomenclature 
of mental disorders," the introduction to the new volume says, "DSM-IV is 
grounded in empirical evidence."  
</P>
<P>
 The volume certainly looks scientific. It's an imposing maze, divided into 
axes, major diagnostic classes and individual disorders. There are no treatment 
recommendations -- the manual is purely diagnostic. Each disorder comes with 
several paragraphs of description, along with information about how prevalent 
it is and the expected course of behavior for those afflicted. The core of each 
diagnosis, though, is a checklist of symptoms, the psychiatric equivalent of a 
blood test. If a patient meets, say, five of nine criteria under the 
description of Borderline Personality Disorder, then the patient will likely be 
assigned the label.  
</P>
<P>
 As psychiatrists identify more and more disorders, the codes have 
proliferated. A hundred years ago, there were only seven labels applied to the 
emotionally disturbed: mania, melancholia, monomania, paresis, dementia, 
dipsomania and epilepsy. The first DSM, released in 1952, listed 197 diagnostic 
categories. Today, DSM-IV describes nearly 300 disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I use the DSM-III-R probably every day," says Marc Graff, assistant chief of 
psychiatry for Kaiser Permanente in the east San Fernando Valley. "I keep a 
copy at work, one at home and I carry one on call. It helps me conceptualize 
what's going on with a patient." 
</P>
<P>
 But others, both inside and outside the profession, consider the system of 
categorizing disorders arbitrary at best and dangerous at worse. "It's not 
really an objective document at all," argues University of Montreal sociology 
professor David Cohen, who specializes in mental-health trends. "There's really 
nothing scientific about it. It's really just a list of our sins and 
deviations; it's a repository of our fears and our dislikes and hatreds." 
</P>
<P>
 Arbitrary or not, this list has become a money-making industry. DSM-II, a 
134-page spiral-bound notebook, sold for $3.50 in 1968. DSM-IV, the fattest and 
most expensive manual yet, contains more than 880 pages between its burgundy 
covers and sells for $54.95 hardcover. In addition, the American Psychiatric 
Press, a subsidiary of the American Psychiatric Assn., churns out pocket 
guides, desk guides, quick reference guides, casebooks and all manner of DSM 
support material. Last year, the DSM-III-R, of which 650,000 copies have been 
sold, and sideline publications grossed $22 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Such growth has not come quietly. The history of the manual has been 
punctuated by some noisy, public battles. In the early '70s, gays protested the 
inclusion of homosexuality as a mental disorder. Also in the '70s, Vietnam 
veterans lobbied to have Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder included. After 
considerable agitation and research, homosexuality was removed and 
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder added.  
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, two proposed categories affecting women have caused rumbles. 
Women's groups argued that including Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (in 
essence, PMS) in the manual would unfairly pigeonhole roughly 500,000 
Americans. Nevertheless, it made the DSM-IV list of disorders requiring further 
study. Women also protested the inclusion of Self-Defeating Personality 
Disorder. This label, included in DSM-III-R, has been applied to patients -- 
usually women -- who made destructive life choices or stayed in abusive or 
unsatisfactory relationships. After much debate, it was eliminated from DSM-IV. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Feminists fought the labels because they are well aware of how powerful a 
label can be. "The DSM has enormous influence over many aspects of American 
life," says Herb Kutchins, professor of social work at Cal State Sacramento and 
co-author of "The Selling of DSM: The Rhetoric of Science in Psychiatry." Each 
year, more than 20% of Americans suffer from a mental illness, according to the 
National Institute of Mental Health. This segment of the population that is 
labeled can experience stigmatization, loss of employment, rejection for health 
insurance, involuntary commitment, forced drugging or electroshock, or loss of 
a child in custody cases.  
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Jensvold, a respected researcher for the mental-health institute, 
says that receiving a label was part of a series of events that derailed her 
life and ended her promising career as a scientist. "In general, I'm not 
against psychiatric diagnosis. I'm against the misuse of psychiatric diagnosis, 
and every diagnosis has the potential to be misused. Some have so much 
potential for misuse they should not be included in DSM." 
</P>
<P>
 Other critics would drop the whole diagnostic system, saying it resembles an 
earlier catalogue of fears and superstitions. Says Kutchins: "I think the DSM 
should be put up on the shelf next to another oppressive historical oddity -- 
the Malleus Maleficarum -- the 15th-Century diagnostic guide to witches."  
</P>
<P>
 IF THE MANUAL SCIENTIFICALLY ADVANCES THE PROFESSION OR DRAGS IT further into 
controversy, the man most responsible is Allen Frances, the 51-year-old 
chairman of the department of psychiatry at Duke University. Frances was 
selected by the American Psychiatric Assn. to oversee DSM-IV because of his 
"distinguished record of involvement in DSM-III and DSM-III-R," says Harold 
Pincus, deputy medical director for the APA and vice-chairman of the DSM-IV 
task force. "And he had done significant research on psychiatric diagnoses and 
classification." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Frances did not always believe mental distress could be neatly 
categorized. As a young psychoanalyst in training at Columbia University in the 
'70s, Frances looked askance at early efforts to scientifically classify mental 
illness. "I thought they were missing the point and poetry of the interactive 
relationship with the patient," he says. "But I came to realize, partly from 
clinical experience and partly from reading -- partly from growing up -- that 
the field did need to have a standard language. It is all well and good to have 
a poetry of interpersonal relationship, but we also needed (the DSM) for good 
medical practice."  
</P>
<P>
 Frances sought to avoid the controversies that divided previous DSM committees 
by placing less emphasis on input from the public and special interest groups. 
"We discouraged position papers gathered to support one or another point of 
view," he says. "The idea was to be as comprehensive, systematic and as fair as 
possible in the interpretation of the findings." 
</P>
<P>
 The massive, complicated enterprise lasted four years and involved more than 
1,000 committee members and advisers. Thirteen groups -- handpicked by Frances 
and organized by genres such as personality disorders, psychotic disorders and 
anxiety disorders -- generally met twice a year and held conference calls as 
often as once a week. Their mission: to fine-tune disorders listed in the 
DSM-III-R and to evaluate the studies that would support new categories. 
</P>
<P>
 The 27-member task force that oversaw the committees received more than 100 
proposals but added only 13 new disorders. Frances worked to reduce the number 
of new categories, he says, because earlier editions listed new disorders only 
to stimulate research. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he tried to keep controversy to a minimum, clashes did occur over 
Self-Defeating Personality Disorder and Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder. 
Frances calls them "tempests in a thimble" and laments that the media have 
overplayed the controversy by choosing to focus on these disorders. But Paula 
Caplan, professor of psychology at the University of Toronto and author of "The 
Myth of Women's Masochism," feels that the attention was justified. She was one 
of a number of feminist scholars and psychologists who testified that the label 
would be particularly ruinous in cases involving abuse or harassment, where it 
could be argued that a woman brought the trouble on because of her 
self-defeating personality.  
</P>
<P>
 The committee's deliberations over the diagnosis were riddled with 
"pseudoscience and sloppy science," says Caplan, who gives her view of the 
issue in a forthcoming book: "How DO They Decide Who Is Normal?" When Caplan 
appeared to testify at a 1985 hearing for DSM-III-R on the self-defeating 
classification (one of the rare occasions on which a DSM task force invited 
outside input), she figured the committee had solid rationale for wanting it in 
the manual. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked into this boardroom at APA headquarters (in Washington, D.C.) and 
here were all these great, famous psychiatrists whose work I had read," says 
Caplan. "It was really exciting. I figured I'd make my five-minute remark and 
these people would tell me what I was missing. I expected them to have data to 
point to; I was prepared to learn."  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, there was little research on the proposed disorder, she says, 
certainly nothing that could be called hard data. Robert L. Spitzer, chairman 
of both the DSM-III and DSM-III-R task forces and a proponent of the category, 
acknowledged: "There was a small amount of evidence that the criteria held 
together. There were one or two studies, not without their problems." 
</P>
<P>
 After Caplan presented her argument, she says, there was a polite silence, 
then a committee member said: "But we have to have this category because we see 
patients like this all the time." Caplan was amazed; the utility of the 
diagnosis seemed to take precedence over considerations of scientific merit. 
Spitzer later confirmed that the rationale for retaining the category was: 
"Clinicians had found this a useful concept." 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the hearing, Caplan recalls, the committee chair asked: "Shall 
we adjourn to the -- dare I say it -- the Freud Room?" In the Freud Room 
sanctum, the committee members, mostly men, decided to retain Self-Defeating 
Personality Disorder in DSM-III-R, where it appeared in the appendix of 
proposed categories needing further study, complete with a code number and a 
set of descriptive criteria. It was now fair game for clinicians to assign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe we listened to them and tried to understand their views," Spitzer 
says of the dissenters. "We didn't leave the meeting agreeing with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Caplan feels differently. "There is a breathtaking arrogance about those 
people that allows them to say things they can't begin to support," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 A LABEL CAN MARK A PROFOUND passage in a person's life. David Oaks was a 
sophomore at Harvard University in 1975 when emotional distress and what he 
describes as some mystical experiences landed him in a psychiatric ward. One 
psychiatrist examined him and labeled him schizophrenic, he says. A second 
psychiatrist diagnosed manic-depression. The two doctors stepped out into the 
hall and conferred, he says, then returned to present Oaks with his new label, 
straight out of DSM-III: schizophreniform, an illness similar to schizophrenia, 
but with less than six months' duration. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was first labeled, it was almost like a religious thing, like going to 
a priest," Oaks says. "There was some degree of relief, a kind of giddiness, 
which I later realized was because I was literally giving up my power."  
</P>
<P>
 He was institutionalized for almost a week, one of five involuntary 
psychiatric hospitalizations during his years at Harvard. As a senior, he 
joined a mental-health patients support group and has been out of the hospital 
and off medication since. Oaks now co-coordinates Support Coalition 
International, a Eugene, Ore.-based worldwide network of "psychiatric 
survivors."  
</P>
<P>
 Even psychiatrists are not immune from the power of labels. Margaret Jensvold 
was the only woman doctor in a unit studying menstrual-related mood disorders 
at the National Institute of Mental Health in 1987. Soon after starting at the 
institute, she began complaining that her male co-workers made sexist and 
degrading remarks. Her supervisor forced her to see a psychiatrist because, he 
felt, she was demanding and had a hard time getting along with co-workers. The 
psychiatrist, she says, found Jensvold to have self-defeating personality 
traits, the traits that belonged to the category Caplan had fought so hard to 
have excluded. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first split second I was just in shock," recalls Jensvold, 37. "I was in 
shock that anyone could conceive of me as being self-defeating." Her next 
reaction: "I'm so glad I'm a psychiatrist. I know the history of this diagnosis 
and I know what he's trying to do to me. People had predicted if this diagnosis 
was in the DSM, women would be blamed for their own victimization, and that's 
just what they were doing to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after she was pressured into therapy, her fellowship at the institute was 
terminated. Jensvold filed a sex discrimination lawsuit against her employer, 
and two months ago, a U.S. District Court jury in Baltimore awarded her a 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Self-Defeating Personality Disorder was dropped from the newest DSM manual, 
but it wasn't because the task force agreed that the label was prone to misuse. 
"That was not the major reason for not including it," Frances says. It was 
dropped for lack of documentation, he says, adding that it is a useful concept 
in therapy but does not "translate well into descriptive psychiatry."  
</P>
<P>
 PATIENT ADVOCATES SAY that the problem is not so much the labels themselves 
but the power and authority behind them. "This is an extralegal document," says 
Oaks of Support Coalition International. "The worst thing about it is the force 
that backs it up. They have to label you to do something to you." 
</P>
<P>
 The legal implication of a DSM tag varies from state to state, but anyone who 
is found to have a mental disorder may lose certain rights. In California, for 
example, people can be committed to an institution if they cannot provide for 
their own food, clothing or shelter. Jean Matulis, a Glendale attorney who 
works with mentally disabled clients, gives this scenario: "Your parents kick 
you out; you don't have a place to live. If a psychiatrist comes along and says 
that's because of a mental disorder, you can be committed." 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies can regard a DSM diagnosis the way they would a 
pre-existing medical condition. Jim Preis, executive director of Mental Health 
Advocacy Services in Los Angeles, says his agency sometimes hears from clients 
who have had coverage discontinued. "People with mental disabilities do get cut 
off from insurance," he says, and legal challenges are often unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 In legal proceedings, Matulis says, "the DSM has a lot more weight than it 
probably deserves, when it's really only the collective hunches of a bunch of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Some lawyers go so far as to argue for labels to be banned from courtrooms. 
"These labels furnish virtually zero useful legal information," says Stephen J. 
Morse, professor of law and psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, who 
specializes in mental health and the law. "They're diagnostic pixie dust." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, most people who go to the corner shrink for Prozac are not going to 
lose their children or their jobs, or be stigmatized in any overt way. In many 
cases, the labels allow psychiatrists to work more efficiently. Patients often 
describe common problems, says San Fernando Valley psychiatrist Graff, and the 
DSM allows the doctor to quickly identify the disorder.  
</P>
<P>
 The labels are also useful in communicating with other health professionals. 
"It's a shorthand way of conveying a lot of information in one word, or one 
number," says Beverly Feinstein, a Santa Monica psychiatrist, adding that she's 
uncomfortable with labeling every patient. "(But) it also helps us decide 
whether medication is indicated. And having a label can help patients learn 
about their illness and connect with others with the same illness."  
</P>
<P>
 "Patients often feel uniquely damned -- like they're the first person to 
invent a particular problem," says Frances, the DSM-IV chairman. "But the DSM 
shows them their problems are generally so common and well-described that 
they're right down there on paper. This can be very relieving." 
</P>
<P>
 Patients advocates like Oaks and Breggin say the DSM upholds a power 
differential in society by classifying only those who are already powerless and 
on the fringes -- people who hear voices, are afraid, or who don't fit 
prescribed gender roles. "If you're a girl who complains about being a girl, 
you're in the book," says Oaks. "You're in trouble." And, he points out, what 
is not in the manual is as revealing as what is. Traits often associated with 
people in power are nowhere to be found. "Where are the categories for greed, 
racism, exploitation?" he says.  
</P>
<P>
 To illuminate the point that behaviors associated with those in power don't 
make it into the DSM, Paula Caplan submitted for inclusion in the new manual a 
proposal for a category she called Delusional Dominating Personality Disorder, 
also called Macho Personality Disorder or John Wayne syndrome. If there were to 
be classifications for traditionally female emotional distresses, she reasoned, 
then there should be a category for stereotypically male traits. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing against the proposal, former DSM chief Spitzer says: "It was an effort 
to embarrass us and make us look silly. Every undesirable social attitude 
doesn't necessarily constitute a mental disorder." 
</P>
<P>
 THE INTEGRITY OF THE DSM -- AND perhaps all of psychiatry -- hinges to a large 
degree on reliability. After all, physical medicine is fairly reliable. Two 
internists, presented with the same patient and the same symptoms, are likely 
to diagnose, say, appendicitis. If DSM diagnoses could be declared reliable, 
psychiatry would edge closer to the domain of physical medicine. Reliability 
equals science. Reliability equals respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the concept is so critical, the American Psychiatric Assn. widely 
touted the reliability of DSM diagnoses in the past. But Spitzer now admits 
that those claims were overblown. "We've greatly improved reliability," he 
says. "But it's still far from satisfactory in many areas. We're not nearly 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 The same could be said of claims that the newest DSM is moving closer to 
science. The committees did base their decisions on documentation, but there 
was no standard for how much or what kind of documentation a disorder had to 
have to be included. The four-out-of-five-symptoms-means-you're-crazy criteria 
have been extensively criticized for being unscientific. And some of the 
criteria are so vague that claims to strict science are dubious. For an 
individual to be found to have Oppositional Defiant Disorder, for instance, he 
must meet four of eight conditions for at least six months. Among the symptoms: 
often loses temper; is often touchy or easily annoyed; is often angry and 
resentful; is often spiteful or vindictive. In a bad year, this could be almost 
any of us. 
</P>
<P>
 Frances counters such criticism by saying it all depends on how science is 
defined. "A naive conception of science is that the data come up and hit you in 
the face," he says. "There's always an element of interpretation." Spitzer 
adds, "The spirit of the DSM is a scientific spirit."  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, for some people, the big burgundy book has taken on an absolutism 
that the DSM architects may never have intended, but psychiatry is not entirely 
to blame. The introduction to the manual includes several pages of disclaimers, 
caveats and cautions suggesting, for example, that the diagnoses not be taken 
too literally, especially in some legal settings. The diagnostic model can be 
"reductionist and dumb" if applied too rigidly, Frances says. "We encourage 
clinicians to use their judgment. The DSM has great utility as a clinical and 
research tool if we're not too slavishly bound by it," he adds.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the profession's warnings, many people have willingly taken on the 
yoke of labels. It's as if the doctors penned the constitution of the 
psychiatric state and the people ratified it and exalted it. Yet, the people 
can also "pull the plug" on the DSM, as Oaks advocates. After being told she 
has Self-Defeating Personality Disorder, Jensvold wrote a letter to task-force 
head Frances: "It recently occurred to me that if they can label me, then I can 
label me. I say I have self-empowering personality."

HOUSING WORKSHOP STRESSED CO-MANAGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week, 62 residents of housing projects in Watts and Mar Vista took part 
in a workshop aimed at giving them more control over where they live. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosted by Loyola Marymount University and offered through the Nickerson 
Gardens Resident Management Corp., the three-day workshop prepared the 
residents for community jobs with the goal that eventually they will co-manage 
their projects with the city's housing authority. "With experience, they can 
run these facilities at a lower price and can provide jobs for the community," 
said Loyola Marymount professor of management David Boje, who helped begin the 
program three years ago after a visit to Nickerson Gardens. "It can also be a 
way out." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the first training program, seven residents of Nickerson 
Gardens are now employed as gardeners, maintenance workers or typists at the 
projects. Though there are only two positions currently open in that community, 
Boje said this year's workshop will aid in creating a temporary employment 
agency for Nickerson Gardens residents, who make up the bulk of the workshop's 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the agency, residents will be able to work for various city 
departments on a short-term basis if regular city employees are sick or on 
vacation, or if the departments need more personnel. Boje says workshop 
participants were also given access to a 12-week training program for those who 
want to start their own businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 To further help would-be entrepreneurs, Boje envisions enlisting an 
eight-member team of Peace Corps volunteers experienced in helping economically 
disadvantaged communities. They would provide training and follow-up in 
"micro-enterprise" for two years, he said, and might also live in the projects. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop was scheduled to conclude with a graduation ceremony Friday 
afternoon at the university. Residents of the Hacienda Village, Imperial Courts 
and Jordan Downs housing projects also attended the workshop.

PASSION PLAY; WILD FANS, CRAZED PLAYERS AND A NATION IN THRALL -- WHEN IT COMES 
TO FUTBOL MADNESS, NOBODY OUT-OBSESSES THE ARGENTINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Julie Cart, Times staff writer Julie Cart is covering the World Cup. She 
also reported on the 1990 Cup. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buenos Aires is where Ford Falcons come to die. The car that has all but 
disappeared from the United States is thriving here, gleaming in anachronistic 
chrome and shift-on-the-column obsolescence. They are used mostly as taxis, and 
in Argentina, no less than New York City, a taxi serves as a microcosm of 
culture and color, a mobile commentary booth on the world at large. The driver 
warms up with politics; tango and pop music are worth a passing comment. But 
Topic A is futbol. The driver angrily dissects the Argentine national team's 
disappointing performance in World Cup qualifying. With each bitter description 
of a loss, the taxi swerves and seems to lash out at other automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 For a decade and a half, Argentina has dominated the quadrennial World Cup, 
winning in 1978 and 1986 and finishing second in 1990. But Argentina struggled 
during qualifying matches and was the last nation to make the 24-team 
tournament, which opens next week in Chicago and ends with the championship 
match on July 17 in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Falcon's front seat, a cigarette punctuates the commentary. "Too much 
defensive play." A stab toward the rearview mirror. "No one knows how to 
dribble the ball!" Smoke slaloms along the dashboard. "Beaten by Colombia! In 
Buenos Aires!" The driver's voice rises in outrage and the cigarette, mashed 
into a stub, gets flicked out the window. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina and Argentines are futbol crazy. In a country of 33 million people, 
more than 6 million play regularly. The players from this South American 
country populate the best teams in Europe, the sport's premier locale. Men like 
Claudio Caniggia and Gabriel Batistuta are among the biggest of the big-money 
soccer stars. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a sport renowned for fan devotion, Argentines are in a slightly scary 
class of their own. They've all but institutionalized soccer hooliganism and 
even the most peaceful of fans blithely toss bottles and cherry bombs and 
incendiary chants around the stadiums. Second place might as well not exist for 
an Argentine fan, and even a victory isn't good enough unless it is 
accomplished with style and grace. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which makes Argentina a case study in what the United States has been 
missing. Neither Pele, the great Brazilian star who played in the United States 
in the 1970s, nor a thriving network of amateur youth and adult leagues could 
overcome Americans' well-known immunity to soccer fever. When the World Cup 
unfolds in nine U.S. cities over the next month, it will be this country's 
first real encounter with a sports passion that enthralls most of the world -- 
and that Argentina defines. 
</P>
<P>
 In Buenos Aires, the cabby never lets up his lament about his country's 
showing in the qualifying rounds. When he pulls to a stop at the Argentine 
Football Association headquarters, he can't let this opportunity pass. He 
twists around in his seat to send a message to Julio Grondona, the AFA 
president. A new cigarette is in one hand and the car's glowing lighter is in 
the other. "Tell Grondona the team must do well in the United States," he says, 
waving the lighter. "We must reclaim our pride by winning the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 THE FIRST SMOKE BOMB EXPLODES just as the players from the preliminary game 
are dashing from the field. Noxious orange smoke billows from the projectile 
and follows the junior players. The crowd is pleased. From the stands, other 
noisy devices are set off: M-80s, cherry bombs and the odd homemade bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 On this night, as two Buenos Aires-based teams, Racing and Ferro Carril Oeste, 
are about to face off at Racing's stadium, security appears especially spotty: 
Although no glass is allowed, the field is already littered with broken 
bottles. The bottles occasionally fall short and shatter on the concrete 
embankment surrounding the field -- it's a nice sound. In addition to the 
embankment, a moat and a 20-foot-high net keep the fans off the field. During 
the game, several spectators clamber up and hang there, suspended like spiders 
on a web. 
</P>
<P>
 From March to August, twice a week, followers of soccer gather as disciples at 
the altars of their religion, Argentina's dozen or so state-of-the-art futbol 
stadiums. The carefully tended fields are used only for soccer, and only by the 
20 teams of the country's First Division soccer league. The teams are sponsored 
by athletic clubs, some with tennis courts, swimming pools and other 
facilities, but whose prime purpose is to operate the teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Each club and each stadium employ different methods for protecting players, 
coaches and officials as they go on and off the field. At Racing's field, the 
players enter from underground, up through what resembles submarine hatches on 
the sideline. Racing's 11 starters trot onto the field, but the rest of the 
team hunkers behind a blue tarp designed to intercept the stray bottle or 
citrus. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the first half, the home crowd is in a fine mood as Racing 
produces two goals to Ferro Carril's none. The teams leave the field, each down 
its own hatch. Moments later, the referees and players from Ferro Carril 
re-emerge. It seems that the power to the visiting locker room and the 
officials' changing room has been shut off. Strangely, there is no electrical 
problem in the home locker room. The players from Ferro Carril encamp in the 
middle of the field. Fans view this development as an unexpected but welcome 
chance for target practice. The players huddle closer and attempt to ignore the 
fusillade of debris glancing off the playing field around them. Moments before 
the game is to resume, club officials announce that the power "to the affected 
portions of the stadium" has been restored. 
</P>
<P>
 The second half does not go well for Racing. One of its players removes his 
shirt and throws it to the fans in celebration of a goal -- a rule violation 
that results in the player's ejection. Racing will not be allowed to replace 
him and must play one man short. The fans, who had encouraged the player's 
display of devotion to them, now turn against him. Ferro Carril scores twice, 
and the game ends in a 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans storm out of the stadium but not away from it. They mill around 
outside, discussing again and again the stupidity of the player, cursing him. A 
mob forms near the Racing locker room. The team bus is parked nearby, and the 
swelling crowd rocks it, terrifying the driver. People shout at the players 
through windows that had been broken after some other loss. "You are a dead 
man!" is the general sentiment, which has been broadened now to include the 
entire team and the coaches. A couple of kids are hoisted up to the windows to 
relay the crowd's curses, close range. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of shots -- POP! POP! -- ring out. Police have fired into the air in 
a vain attempt to disperse the crowd. Two hours after the game, a journalist 
for the Buenos Aires-based national newspaper Clarin emerges from the locker 
room and works his way free of the crush of fans. He is asked if the players 
will be coming out soon. "No, no," he says, glancing at the angry mob. "They 
will not come out. They know what is waiting for them." 
</P>
<P>
 The bus driver toots the horn, his stab at shooing away the fans. Then he 
abandons the bus and fights his way to the locker room. The door opens and he 
hurries inside. In the midst of the roiling and shouting crowd, a fan begins to 
sob, overcome by anger and frustration. His T-shirt reads: "Racing. An 
inexplicable passion." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the events that took place after the game will merit so much as a line 
in the journalist's report. Nothing unusual happened. 
</P>
<P>
 SOCCER IS PLAYED EVERYWHERE IN ARGENTINA, BY EVERYONE, AT ALL times. At midday 
by shirt-sleeved businessmen on traffic medians and at night by children 
dodging parked cars under the glow of street lights. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Argentina, the first present for a boy is a soccer ball. The father wants 
to see his son with a ball, playing football. It is a dream," says Pholo 
Toledo, assistant to Cesar Luis Menotti, coach of the popular professional team 
Boca Juniors and a former World Cup coach. "It is unusual in the United States 
to see a boy kicking a ball. In our small towns, the children play with a ball. 
If they don't have one, they play with a T-shirt or with paper, rocks, 
anything, everything. Most of the time they place two rocks on the ground. The 
space between them, that is the goal." 
</P>
<P>
 In their dreams, those kids are playing in the big leagues, on one of 
Argentina's First Division professional teams, where fame and fortune -- top 
club players make about $2 million a year -- await. There are many tiers to 
professional soccer in Argentina. The highest level is the First Division. 
Below that are the B Division and C Division, similar to baseball's minor 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the best Argentine players compete in the even more lucrative European 
professional leagues, returning to Argentina only for international matches or 
for the few weeks before the World Cup to prepare. The national coach, now 
Alfio Basile, works full time, at least until he's fallen out of favor with the 
public -- or the Argentine Football Association. 
</P>
<P>
 The AFA headquarters occupy several floors of a turn-of-the-century office 
building in downtown Buenos Aires. It is an important address, as befits the 
stature of the organization. The decor in the ornate wood-paneled offices -- 
with scores of trophies and cups and withered soccer balls in glass cases -- is 
meant to leave the impression that this is one of Argentina's most important 
places. AFA president Grondona, with his desk full of telephones and a 
photograph of himself with the Pope, believes this. He's spent virtually all 
his adult life in the hierarchy of Argentine soccer. Before heading the AFA, he 
was the president of the nation's largest soccer and athletic club, 
Independiente. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviews with Grondona are not so much question - and - answer sessions as 
lectures punctuated by pauses in which questions may be offered, but also 
ignored. At this moment, he is losing patience explaining the unexplainable: 
"Football is a sport which is passionate by nature. Do you know why? All the 
sports where you use the hands are easier. Yes? When you use your legs only . . 
. instead of sport, we can talk about dance. This is the main point." Pause. 
Then, as if to underscore the capriciousness of his job as the country's top 
soccer administrator, the knife-edge risk of it, he adds, "I think that the 
Argentines have two faces, two different ways. When we win, it seems that we 
are gods. When we lose, we are good for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer was introduced to Argentina by British sailors who often played in 
Buenos Aires' port area. In 1901, British immigrants formed the River Plate 
team, and 12 years later, an Irishman and a handful of Italians assembled the 
Boca Juniors, the nemesis of River Plate. Their rivalry has long been marked by 
class divisions: The wealthy tend to identify with River, the much more 
numerous poor and working class with Boca. 
</P>
<P>
 Native Argentines soon started their own teams and leagues eventually 
developed. The first World Cup, held in Uruguay in 1930, was an exercise in 
humiliation for Argentina: They lost in the championship game to Uruguay, their 
poorer neighbor. Another lackluster showing in 1934 prompted Argentina to 
withdraw from international soccer competition until 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 The national team grew increasingly strong, winning and hosting the World Cup 
in 1978 -- and drawing unwanted global attention on the repressive military 
junta that had come to power in 1976. Some critics, such as Amnesty 
International, questioned the propriety of holding the world's single largest 
sporting event in a nation where kidnaping, torture and murder were common 
tools for silencing political opponents. The junta dismissed all criticism as 
"Marxist plotting." 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina spent hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade its infrastructure 
for the World Cup, including its antiquated mass communications systems. The 
Federation Internationale de Football Association, world soccer's governing 
body, mandated that all games be televised in color; Argentina did not have 
color TV in 1978 but nevertheless broadcast the games abroad in full color. 
Only inside Argentina did the matches appear in black and white. The Argentines 
were so hungry to host the World Cup that there was hardly a stir when the 
minister of economics made the somewhat alarmist announcement that projected 
costs were off by as much as $750 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials would hardly be concerned about the costs of staging the 
tournament, since, to them, the ends more than justified the means: The 
exhilaration of winning the World Cup had the desired effect of numbing the 
populace. The junta probably gained a year or two's grace out of the soccer 
team's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The drain of money and resources aside, some of the Argentine intelligentsia 
were disgusted that the ruling junta had skillfully equated excitement about 
the event with satisfaction with the government. During the tournament, the 
great writer Jorge Luis Borges reflected: "The fact that a game, and a 
commercial one at that, should be promoted to the rank of holy war, passes my 
understanding. I am a fervent patriot and, I hope, a good citizen, but I 
emphatically do not hold the uncanonical belief, now voiced by the press, and 
by the radio, of salvation through football. . . . I abhor or hate Communists, 
Nationalists and Fascists impartially, and I think the cult of football is 
hardly a remedy for these ailments." 
</P>
<P>
 But soccer in Argentina had always thrived independent of politics, notes 
Julio Cesar Pasquato, who writes for the sports magazine El Grafico under the 
name of Juvenal. "There were two paths -- one for the country and one for 
football," he said. "They were parallel but they never crossed. The decade of 
the '40s was wonderful for football. It was a coincidence that (dictator Juan) 
Peron was the president. The decade of the '70s was a military dictatorship, a 
terrible tyranny, but the soccer was wonderful. Nobody can explain it." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the difficulty of understanding the Argentine passion for soccer: No 
one can explain it, but they all feel it. Interviewing soccer fans does not 
evoke great insight. The sport is such a part of the fabric of life in 
Argentina that few think to stop and reflect on its meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 For the poor and working class, though, futbol is a special love. "There is 
passion for football everywhere in South America. There's also a lot of 
poverty," says Eric Weil, sports editor of the Buenos Aires Herald. "All they 
live for, all they can be interested in, is football. That's their life. That's 
their passion. It gives them something to hang on to, something to live for." 
</P>
<P>
 ARGENTINE SOCCER CLUBS CAN BE HUGE -- BOCA JUNIORS HAS ABOUT 70,000 members -- 
and each one has a small but dangerous group of fanatic supporters. In Europe, 
these extremists would be called hooligans, but here they are known as the 
barra brava -- the group of the brave. What 15 years ago began as obnoxious 
behavior and loud singing from the barra brava has today degenerated into 
violence, threats and extortion carried out on local businesses. At most clubs, 
it is an accepted practice for players to buy their own safety by "donating" 
money to the barra brava . 
</P>
<P>
 Boca Juniors' barra brava -- only a few hundred strong -- is perhaps the most 
feared and most organized in the country. It has established a group called the 
Foundation of the 12th Player, which, according to published reports, receives 
up to $10,000 month from the players and a total of $80,000 a month from other 
sources. The money goes into the pockets of the leaders of the "foundation." 
</P>
<P>
 Boca's barra brava is out in force when the team meets its archrival, River 
Plate, in a tournament in Mendoza, along the Andean border with Chile. 
Mendoza's stadium is a simple bowl made of concrete and seems to have been 
dropped into a stand of poplar trees. Two hours before the game starts the 
stands are already half-filled. Directly behind the goal, in a sea of blue and 
yellow shirts, is a swath of beige -- the bare chests of Boca's barra brava . 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when nearly all of the 47,000 fans have arrived, the crowd ignores the 
ragged drill team and flag girls the organizers provide expressly to calm them. 
Light whistling cascades down on the entertainers, who have been marching 
stoically around the field. The singing of the rival fan groups has long since 
drowned out the chirpy tune played over the public address system and, 
mercifully, the entertainers are hustled off the field and the teams trot on. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, as in every stadium in Argentina, rival barra bravas buy seats at 
opposite ends of the field. This arrangement keeps them physically at bay but 
does not quell the volatile verbal confrontations: the incessant singing. The 
songs are sometimes clever, they are often profane, they are always insulting 
and sung at full-lung bellow throughout the game. Nothing escapes the derision 
of the fans. When Boca scores, their fans taunt River Plate from across the 
stadium: "A moment of silence because River is dead. Cry, River, cry!"  
</P>
<P>
 The next time Boca players are at River's end of the field, a flare is heaved 
on the field. Play is halted while the flare burns itself out. When the teams 
change sides after the half, each opposing goalkeeper will be exposed to rival 
fans. River fans pelt Boca's keeper with oranges and Boca's supporters throw 
plastic water bottles at River's goalkeeper. Ignored on the stadium's 
scoreboard is the message: "Please don't throw projectiles." 
</P>
<P>
 Tournament organizers are serious about preempting any organized trouble. The 
seating area behind each goal is outlined in cyclone fencing topped with razor 
wire. Outside of the fences stands a line of young soldiers, each with a 
holstered side-arm and a baton or stick. Here, a week before, there had been 
trouble. Provincial police stopped buses filled with barra bravas at a 
checkpoint outside town. A gun battle ensued with 17 people wounded and 190 
fans taken to jail. Asked if working at a soccer game is considered hazardous 
duty, one of the blue-uniformed soldiers rolls his eyes at such an obvious 
question. "Quite," he says, and goes back to watching the fans through the 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see something. It's a wonderful thing. It's Boca, Boca!" With each new 
song, usually sung to the tune of a popular hit, the fans erupt into a mass of 
noisy movement. Boca scores again. The player takes off and dashes to face his 
fans, who strain toward him. River's fans come to life and begin a derisive 
chant about their own coach. Each team scores a goal and the game is over. Boca 
wins, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Security personnel herd the fans out the exits. On the field, police dogs 
strain against their leashes. As the River end of the stadium empties, the fans 
leave behind their traditional calling card after a loss -- they have set fire 
to everything combustible. Dozens of small fires flicker. Outside the stadium, 
Boca fans begin singing and gather for their long march into town. It is nearly 
1 in the morning -- time for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Boca and River make up the country's most serious rivalry, and when they met 
again last month, the rivalry flared into tragedy after River scored a rare win 
on Boca's home field. After the game, six people were shot and two died in 
fighting between rival fan groups. 
</P>
<P>
 IN MANY WAYS, DIEGO ARMANDO Maradona, a former street urchin from the grungy 
town of Fiorito, is a metaphor for the lunacy that is Argentine soccer. 
Maradona was a soccer prodigy. He was already performing dribbling and 
ball-juggling feats at age 10, began his professional career at 15 and the next 
year represented his country in his first international match. At 17, he was 
the last player cut from the 1978 World Cup team. He played for Argentina in 
the 1982 Cup, but was sent off the field in the closing moments of a losing 
game after kicking an opponent in the stomach. His temper had yet to be tamed. 
</P>
<P>
 His maturation as a player came quickly after that. No player in the history 
of the game has dominated a World Cup as Maradona did in 1986. His most 
spectacular moment came on a predictably emotional stage: The quarterfinal 
match between Argentina and England. It was the first time their soccer teams 
had faced each other since the 1982 Falklands war and emotions were boiling: 
British fans rival the Argentines in belligerence. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was played amid high security at 114,000-seat Azteca Stadium in 
Mexico City. After a scoreless first half, Maradona began a penetrating attack, 
dribbling into England's penalty area. His dangerous run was halted when a 
defender stripped the ball and lofted it toward the goal and the safekeeping of 
English goalie Peter Shilton. Shilton never got it. Maradona darted toward the 
goal, leaped high, intercepted the ball in the air and deftly knocked it into 
the goal with his head. Or so it appeared. The English protested that Maradona 
had hit the ball with his hand -- highly illegal in soccer. The referee didn't 
agree and the goal stood. Only later, after careful analysis of the televised 
replays, did it become obvious that Maradona had in fact punched the ball. 
Maradona never acknowledged the foul, saying only that if there was a hand 
involved, it was "The hand of God." And so the goal has forever been named. 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona's career has been characterized by acclaim and controversy of 
operatic proportions. He is known as a master ball handler and a bold, creative 
strategist who, like a chess player, plans several moves ahead. He has no 
qualms about putting his body in harm's way. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, the diminutive midfielder went from the Spanish club Barcelona to 
Napoli in Italy for the then-record transfer fee of $10 million. Maradona's 
salary was to be $2 million a year, making him one of the world's highest-paid 
athletes. He began his career in Naples by reporting to preseason training camp 
one month late. Maradona flourished in Italy in all the wrong ways: He loved 
the women -- and was hit with a paternity suit. He loved the food -- he gained 
weight and was fined by his club. He loved the climate -- he refused to train 
with the team, preferring to lounge with his entourage at his villa. Other 
players in the league referred to him as "that tub of lard." 
</P>
<P>
 Some thought his marriage in 1989 to Claudia Villafane, his longtime 
sweetheart and the mother of his two daughters, was a sign that the bad boy was 
maturing. Those signs faded, however, as the wedding plans grew absurdly. 
Maradona chartered a 747 to shuttle pals from Italy to Buenos Aires and rented 
a basketball arena to hold the reception for more than 1,000 guests. The tab: 
more than $3 million. The groom wore black and punched out a photographer 
before the service. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 World Cup in Italy was to be Maradona's glittering stage. He was at 
the height of his skills, the captain of a strong Argentine team that was the 
defending champion and would be playing in front of fans in Naples, his adopted 
city, where he is known simply as "The King." With characteristic bravado, 
Maradona said of the championship trophy: "Those who want it are going to have 
to tear the World Cup from inside Argentina's heart." But he spent the 
tournament picking himself up off the field after incessant fouls, his 
opponents' strategy being, if you can't beat him, beat him. Maradona was the 
most fouled player in the tournament and played with a grotesquely swollen left 
ankle that needed painkilling injections before each match. Nevertheless, 
Argentina advanced. 
</P>
<P>
 The final, one of the ugliest, most mean-spirited games ever played in the 
World Cup, was marked by frequent fouling and brutal play, atypical of a sport 
where grace and finesse are prized. West Germany won, 1-0, on a controversial 
penalty kick, and Maradona insulted his adopted country by saying the whole 
tournament had been tainted by "Mafia influence." 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona returned to his Italian club team after the World Cup. In 1991, 
during routine post-match testing, he came up positive for cocaine. FIFA 
suspended Maradona for 15 months. He returned to Buenos Aires, declared his 
intention to retire and entered a drug treatment program. Not much later, he 
was briefly held on drug charges after a police raid. After serving his 
suspension, Maradona un-retired to play for Sevilla in Spain but was fired 
after various offenses, the worst being the alarming deterioration of his 
skills. Again he returned to Argentina, where he joined a club called Newell's 
Old Boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months later, in February, he was sacked for skipping practices and the 
media staked out his five-acre estate in suburban Buenos Aires. That so enraged 
Maradona that he grabbed a compressed-air rifle and sprayed pellets at 
journalists. Five of them were slightly injured. Five days after that, Maradona 
smashed a camera into the face of a photographer. 
</P>
<P>
 And the troubles continued. Last month, Maradona was barred from entering 
Japan for a World Cup tuneup match because of his drug history. The entire team 
refused to play and, in Buenos Aires, fans exploded a bomb in front of the 
Japanese Consulate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maradona is still popular," says Weil of the Buenos Aires Herald, "but there 
are more and more people saying he's crazy and he needs treatment. But this is 
a football country and he's done a lot for Argentina. Even now, lots of people 
feel sorry for him."  
</P>
<P>
 Maradona is virtually certain to be named to Argentina's World Cup team, but 
no one expects him to perform as well as he has in the past; some doubt that he 
will even play. But his presence alone will lend the World Cup a measure of 
dash and danger that the sport thrives on. 
</P>
<P>
 EVERY FOUR YEARS, ARGENTINES REAFFIRM their love for their national team. But 
in this year's World Cup qualifying, the bond was tested by the team's 
overreaching arrogance. In one humbling week in late August, Argentina played 
to a 0-0 tie with lowly Paraguay and lost, 5-0, to Colombia. The worst part: 
Both games were played in Buenos Aires. The team failed to qualify outright in 
its South American group but there was another, longer road. Argentina would 
play Australia, the winner of the Oceania qualifying group, for the last berth 
in the World Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
 The first game ended 1-1 in Sydney. The decisive game was played in River 
Plate Stadium in Buenos Aires in November. Argentina dominated but could not 
score. It began to look like another disaster. The Argentine team got the 
winning goal, but it was inadvertently scored by an Australian defender. This 
is what is known as an "own goal," unsatisfying, yes, but a goal still, and 
Argentina was through to the World Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its struggle during qualifying, Argentina, along with perennial 
favorites Italy, Germany, Brazil and Holland, should be in the running for the 
Cup. The challenge will be to jell as a team and for Basile to merge his 
squad's natural inclination to attack with his own more conservative 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina will be playing in a group with some of the tournament's weakest 
contenders, Greece, Nigeria and Bulgaria. Argentina will play two games in 
Boston and one in Dallas in the first round, with the most difficult of those 
matches coming against Nigeria on June 25. If, as expected, Argentina wins its 
group, it will stay in Boston for the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 For the emotional Argentines, the U.S. World Cup holds one challenge that they 
have never faced before: Will the passion and tumult that the team thrives on 
greet them here? And if not, can soccer's great performers spin their magic in 
a vacuum? Are the crowd and the noise and the danger necessary parts of the 
recipe? 
</P>
<P>
 Julio Cesar Pasquato of El Grafico has covered nine World Cups and admits to 
being concerned about that aspect of this summer's games. He shakes his head 
over the fact that the United States is hosting the world's greatest sports 
spectacle without sharing the world's mania for the game. What will it be like? 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a difficult question for an Argentine because we can't separate 
football from passion," says Pasquato. "Football is a feeling. I can't imagine 
that: no passion in a stadium. The magic of football is the quality and 
intelligence of the players, their love of football. If all that happens in the 
middle of silence -- I don't know. How can I feel in that case? It is difficult 
to know how to feel in the sound of silence."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: MOVIES; IMPOSSIBLE DREAM?; 
YOUR MISSION, MR. DE PALMA . . .

<P>
 The script for the film version of "Mission: Impossible" may be turning out to 
be just that. 
</P>
<P>
 The Paramount Pictures remake of the '60s and early '70s secret-agent series 
is finally under way, and will be directed by Brian De Palma and produced by 
Paula Wagner, partner of the film's star, Tom Cruise. Willard Huyck ("American 
Graffiti," "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom") and his wife, Gloria, are in 
the midst of a rewrite on their original script, but sources close to the 
project say there's a chance that another writer -- perhaps Jay Cocks (who 
co-wrote "The Age of Innocence") -- may be brought in to smooth away the 
current draft's clumsiness. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is not the story line, which, sources say, Wagner and crew are 
happy with. Rather, it's the "bad dialogue and scenes that aren't being flushed 
out. In other words: a bad TV script," said one project source. 
</P>
<P>
 The beginning of the movie, which is slated to begin production later this 
year, supposedly has members of the old "Mission: Impossible" team, including 
Peter Graves, embarked on a secret governmental assignment, toting Cruise, the 
team's youngest operative, along. All are killed except for Cruise. His mission 
becomes forming a new team to find out why his colleagues were assassinated. 
And there is a love interest for the young agent. 
</P>
<P>
 For those whose memories are rusty: There were several teams on the TV series, 
but the most memorable included Peter Graves as the team leader, James Phelps; 
Martin Landau as the disguise expert, Rollin Hand; Barbara Bain as the 
beautiful seductress and fashion model, Cinnamon Carter; Greg Morris as the 
electronics expert, Barney Collier, and Peter Lupus as the strongman, Willie 
Armitage. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening of each episode had Phelps hearing a tape-recorded message 
outlining his next assignment. The tape would self-destruct and Phelps would 
scan his dossiers for the best operatives to handle the assignment. But they 
always ended up being the same agents, except for a few guest operatives. Their 
mission was always thwarting some corrupt power in an obscure country. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the show ran out of little countries, so its writers turned the 
focus on cleaning up organized crime back home. The team's success always 
hinged on split-second timing, sophisticated gadgetry and elaborate plans. 
</P>
<P>
 While the familiar staccato theme written by Lalo Schifrin and Bob Johnson's 
voice on the tape survived the entire series run from 1966 to 1973, the cast 
underwent many changes; Landau and Bain, married in real life, left the show at 
the end of the 1968-69 season. 
</P>
<P>
 A Paramount spokesman confirmed that the studio had received the Huycks' first 
draft, describing it as having a "lot of theatrical elements" that advance the 
TV show's premise. He said that the filmmakers considered the potential for the 
script "excellent," and are convinced the outcome will be a "high-octane film." 
</P>
<P>
 As for a reputed meeting between Wagner, Cocks and De Palma (his friend of 25 
years), the Paramount spokesman said that the writer is working on another 
script for Cruise, a love story called "Night Magic." Any discussion of Cocks' 
input on "Mission: Impossible," he said, could have been brought up in 
discussions on the other project.*

FILM COMMENT; TOASTING THE TOXIC AVENGER'S PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, Kenneth Turan is The Times' film critic.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sitting on the terrace of the Carlton Hotel, his lime green pants and lavender 
socks resplendent in the morning sun, Lloyd Kaufman president of Troma Films, 
casts a benevolent eye on Margot Hope, the fetching writer-producer-director 
and star of Troma's latest extravaganza, "Femme Fontaine: Killer Babe for the 
CIA." 
</P>
<P>
 "Margot," he says, searching for just the right way to be nice, "your film is 
much too good for the American Cinematheque retrospective." 
</P>
<P>
 Not really, because nothing is too good -- or, for that matter, too bad -- for 
the feisty folks from Troma, who in truth will be feted with a three-day 
Cinematheque retrospective (starting Friday at the Directors Guild Theater) in 
honor of 20 years in the business. Longer, the New York-based company boasts, 
"than any other independent distributor and most Hollywood marriages." 
</P>
<P>
 Complete with personal appearances, this may be the first Cinematheque series 
to come with what it calls a surgeon general's warning: "These films are often 
repulsively violent and sexually explicit. Not for children (and many adults)." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are especially pleased to be finally honored in Los Angeles," was 
Kaufman's official response to the event. "The international flights to the 
other tributes were just getting too expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman, who likes to claim that the company name is Latin for "excellence in 
cinema," wasn't just being hyperbolic. Troma's films have been the subject of 
retrospectives in London, Tokyo, Munich, Toronto and San Sebastian, plus a 
monthlong "Aroma du Troma" tribute at the American Film Institute in 
Washington. Not to mention the two Belgian scholars that Kaufman insists are 
devoting their lives to the definitive academic treatment of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Why Troma? Is it because stars like Kevin Costner can be seen just getting 
started in Troma's "Shadows Run Black" and "Sizzle Beach USA"? Or because 
Kaufman and company vice president Michael Herz have co-directed something like 
30 films, a feat worthy of the Guinness Book of World Records? Or is it simply 
that, as Kaufman has put it, "we're the smallest, cheapest movie studio in 
America"? 
</P>
<P>
 "In the entire history of the movie business," he says with his usual sang 
froid, "there has never been a movie studio that existed for 20 years without a 
hit. And so long as we continue as the heads of Troma, we will continue this 
perfect track record." 
</P>
<P>
 Self-mocking and with a genius for self-promotion, the Troma Team, as Kaufman 
likes to call his group, clearly did not get to where they are by taking 
themselves too seriously. "We enjoy what you in the media call sex and 
violence," says Kaufman, who has been known to brandish the actual shoestring 
his movies cost. 
</P>
<P>
 And though his cheerfully tasteless films are as likely to be admired for the 
spirit in which they're made than the quality of the execution, one of 
Kaufman's most accurate boasts is that "when you see something by Troma, you 
may love it or hate it, but you'll never forget the movie." A sentiment that 
goes double for the publicity that goes along for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 For while most critics have not actually sat through many of Kaufman's films, 
almost everyone in the business is familiar with the clever and cheeky titles 
and ad lines that are stuck on them. For instance: 
</P>
<P>
 "Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD: America's First Accidental Oriental Crime Fighter!" 
</P>
<P>
 "A Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell: The Pre-Historic and the 
Pre-Pubescent, Together at Last!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Maniac Nurses Find Ecstasy: Their Weapons Are Sterile, Their Bodies Are 
Fertile, and Any Thought of Escape Is Futile!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Redneck Zombies," filmed in (what else but) Entrail-Vision: "Tobacco Chewin', 
Gut Chompin', Cannibal Kinfolk From Hell!" 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of zaniness is visible also in the Troma Times, the company's genial 
newsletter whose motto is "Dictated but Not Read . . . or Even Thought About." 
And it shows up in the "Troma System" infomercial the company has put together, 
complete with bikini-clad Tromettes, which satirizes self-help ideologies as it 
pushes the sale of various kinds of Tromabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 When you ask Kaufman where he and Herz learned the basics of filmmaking, he is 
likely to answer, "if you read the reviews of our movies, you will see that we 
did not learn." But in fact his film education began at Yale, where he and Herz 
met and where movie buffs in his dorm made him familiar with the efforts of 
Joseph E. Levine and Roger Corman, shrewd producers who inspired his own work. 
</P>
<P>
 After college, Kaufman worked in low-budget filmmaking, and years later even 
had a part in the original "Rocky," playing "a bum sleeping in the gutter who 
Rocky picks up on his shoulder and pops down on a nearby bar." When he and Herz 
founded Troma, tiny budgets were the order of the day, the plan being to make 
films that would have negligible theatrical releases but make most of their 
money in video, cable and overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Starting off the Cinematheque series on Friday night is what Kaufman calls 
"our Mickey Mouse, the movie that put us on the map." That would be "The Toxic 
Avenger," familiarly known as Toxie, a movie so successful it inspired a TV 
series, hundreds of licensed products, two sequels (one called "The Last 
Temptation of Toxie") already released and a third ("Mr. Toxie Goes to 
Washington") in the planning stages. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in Tromaville, N.J., "the toxic waste dump capital of the world," 
"Avenger" details the awful circumstances that turn health club mop boy Melvin 
Furd, "98 pounds of solid nerd," into "the first superhero born out of nuclear 
waste." Equal parts cartoonish violence, simulated sex and broad skit humor, it 
is the kind of treat aficionados of bad taste don't get every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Following that, for those who still haven't had enough, Friday night will 
feature another pair of Troma classics, as "Class of Nuke 'Em High" ("Readin', 
Writin' and Radiation") is paired with "Surf Nazis Must Die." 
</P>
<P>
 Set in a post-earthquake Los Angeles "where the beaches have become 
battlefields," "Nazis" has a rather unusual heroine: Leroy's Mama, a 
cigar-chomping, motorcycle-riding middle-aged black woman who snarls, "Taste 
some of Mama's home cooking," as she lets the lead fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of cycles, Saturday night boasts another Troma classic, "Chopper 
Chicks in Zombietown," which explores what really happens when an all-female 
motorcycle gang takes a breather in a quiet hamlet mainly populated by the 
undead. Typical dialogue, from the leader of the gang to her troops: "You're 
the Sluts. Try and act like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Though you might not know from reading the Troma Times, the company has been 
associated with some classier films as well, and two of the best are showing 
Sunday night. "Def by Temptation," a slickly made (by James Bond III) and 
stylishly photographed (by Ernest Dickerson) all-black horror film about a sexy 
succubus who has her way with men, is offered first, followed by a genuine 
sleeper, Bob Dahlin's 1986 "Monster in the Closet." 
</P>
<P>
 A sweet and loving homage to the golden age of horror films, with genuinely 
scary moments alternating with gentle humor and deft parodies of classics 
ranging from "King Kong" to "Psycho," "Monster" also features an all-star 
collection of cameo performers, including John Carradine, Claude Akins, Howard 
Duff, Henry Gibson, Kenneth Moffat and Stella Stevens. If you have even the 
slightest interest in the genre, this rarely seen treat should not be missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Better films may actually be in Troma's future, since the company has created 
a subsidiary called Fiftieth Street to concentrate on doing just that. And then 
there is the projected "Tromio and Juliet," a no-doubt liberal adaptation of 
Shakespeare's play. And after that? 
</P>
<P>
 "We've become an institution, a national treasure," Kaufman has said, probably 
more than once. "It's not going to be long before Troma will be awarded the 
coveted Nobel Peace Prize."* 
</P>
<P>
 * The schedule for the Troma retrospective at the Directors Guild:  
</P>
<P>
 Friday: "The Toxic Avenger" at 7 p.m. Discussion with Kaufman, Herz and Toxie 
follows. "Class of Nuke 'Em High" and "Surf Nazis Must Die" at 9:15 p.m. 
Discussion with filmmakers and "Surf Nazis" cast follows.

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: CRITICAL CHILDREN; MAYBE 
THEY SHOULD ASK PRINCESS DI'S KIDS TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. WELKOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The critics love "The Princess and the Goblin." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, at least the children of critics do. 
</P>
<P>
 Convinced that some movie reviewers render harsher criticism at animated films 
that don't come from the legendary Walt Disney Co., one small movie company is 
fighting back with a clever marketing scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of quoting adult critics, Hemdale Communications, the distributor of 
"The Princess and the Goblin," is featuring movie ads with pull quotes by 
children of various critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I absolutely loved it!" said Sarah Medved, the 7-year-old daughter of critic 
Michael Medved of TV's "Sneak Previews" and the New York Post. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets 91 stars!" said 4-year-old Anna Regine Campbell, daughter of Bob 
Campbell of Newhouse News Service/Newark Star-Ledger. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemdale executives say they just want adult critics to see the film as 
children might and not presume that only Disney makes quality animated 
features. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not looking to pick a fight with critics over this film," said Tom 
Ortenberg, president of marketing and distribution at Hemdale. "However, there 
is a perception within the industry that critics do favor a Disney animated 
film over others and refuse to look at non-Disney animated films on their own 
merits. Whether that is true, I'm not sure." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Princess and the Goblin" opened Friday in about 800 theaters. In two 
weeks, Disney will open its latest animated film, "The Lion King," in New York 
and Los Angeles. Expected to be one of the year's biggest hits, "The Lion King" 
will be released nationwide on June 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Made at a cost of $10 million, "The Princess and the Goblin" was created by 
writer-producer Robin Lyons and European animators, and is based on the fable 
by George MacDonald about a princess who must overcome her fears in order to 
save her kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the kids'-eye view, Hemdale sent screening cassettes to some critics 
around the country with a request that they sit and watch the movie with their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemdale also held a number of advance screenings for reviewers with one 
proviso: Children had to be in the audience with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time we've invited critics to screenings where we had children 
in attendance," Ortenberg said. "Our unscientific research showed that we got 
more favorable reviews from critics who saw the film in the presence of 
children than those who saw it in a stale, dark screening room all by 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Medved discounted criticism that adult critics like himself are more 
harsh on non-Disney animation, but conceded that Disney's recent animated 
features like "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin" have reached a standard that 
make them special and enduring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think recent Disney animated films are just better," he said. "However, I 
gave a very enthusiastic 3 1/2 stars (four is maximum) to 'Thumbelina,' which 
was released by Warner Bros." 
</P>
<P>
 Some other recent animated films, he noted, have not been so worthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought 'FernGully' was dreadful," he said. "But the worst animated movie 
of recent times was 'Freddie as 'F.R.O.7' in which a frog was a secret agent. 
It had countless jokes about frogs and Frenchmen. And then there was 
'Rock-a-Doodle.' That was a big budget bombarino. It had the voice of Glen 
Campbell and was about a rooster who thought he was Elvis." 
</P>
<P>
 Medved said he attended an advance screening of "The Princess and the Gobblin" 
with his two daughters -- Sarah and 5-year-old Shayna -- and two of their 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "After it was over," he recalled, "a woman who works for Hemdale came out and 
asked the children to rate the movie by stars." 
</P>
<P>
 Both his daughters and one of their friends, 8-year-old Natanya Weiss, gave 
the movie four stars, he said, but 4-year-old Elizabeth Lieber went even 
further, giving it "1,000 stars." 
</P>
<P>
 "As you go down the age spectrum," Medved said, "this movie is more and more 
pleasing." 
</P>
<P>
 Medved himself gave it a mere 2 1/2 stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is possible," he said, "that my daughters will force me to upgrade it to 
three stars."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: LOOK-ALIKES; HATS OFF TO 
THOSE CREATIVE FOLKS IN THE AD DEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It's pretty unusual to see even one movie ad that uses a picture of a man 
strategically covering his private parts with a hat -- an informal poll of film 
buffs would suggest it's never happened -- but this summer there are two. 
</P>
<P>
 The print ad for Universal's "The Cowboy Way" features a picture of Woody 
Harrelson's character in only cowboy boots and a Stetson (not on his head), 
while an ad for Goldwyn's rap music parody "Fear of a Black Hat" shows the 
three members of a fictitious rap group wearing two hats each, one on their 
heads and one on . . . well, you get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 And what's behind the cover-up? Pure coincidence, apparently. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harrelson shot is taken from a key scene in the movie, while the "Fear of 
a Black Hat" ad spoofs a Red Hot Chili Peppers album cover that shows the 
Peppers wearing only well-placed socks. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Universal said he didn't know about the similarity until he 
saw both ads in print just before Memorial Day. "Initially we were concerned, 
(but) we're not at all upset," he said. "We looked at it and said, 'This is 
amusing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "My reaction was I thought it was an interesting coincidence," said Richard 
Bornstein, Goldwyn's vice president of world wide marketing. "I actually didn't 
notice it until it ran." 
</P>
<P>
 Spokespeople for both companies are quick to point out that neither company 
knew about the other's ad, and there seems to be little worry that the two 
movies, both of which opened Friday, will be confused by the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe anybody seeing our ad would think it's (an ad) for 'The 
Cowboy Way,' " said Bornstein. "Unless there's a movie about a cowboy rap 
group, I think we're OK."*

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: BIG SCREEN, LITTLE SCREEN; 
WHAT ABOUT 'ROMPER ROOM: THE MOVIE'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Film producers tend to hit pay dirt when transforming classic TV shows into 
feature films. "Maverick" and "The Flintstones" are now burning up at the box 
office.And producers are already pinning their hopes on the big-screen 
"Mission: Impossible" and "Green Acres." 
</P>
<P>
 But mining the small screen for features is nothing new. The first was 
"Dragnet." No, not the 1987 Tom Hanks-Dan Aykroyd comedy. The cop series was 
actually a 1954 feature film, starring and directed by Jack Webb, who played 
deadpan Sgt. Joe Friday in the original 1952-59 cop series. 
</P>
<P>
 Other series similarly spun off movies while the shows were still on the air, 
among them: "Our Miss Brooks," which went to the big screen in 1956, its final 
year on CBS, with series regulars Eve Arden, Gale Gordon and Richard Crenna 
starring. 
</P>
<P>
 Not until 1983 did we first see the practice of taking a television series and 
redoing it from scratch, with big budgets, big directors and big stars. That's 
when four names of filmdom -- Joe Dante, George Miller, Steven Spielberg and 
John Landis -- lent their talents to the 1983 "Twilight Zone -- the Movie." It 
featured new versions of classic vignettes from Rod Serling's 1959-65 CBS 
anthology series. Vic Morrow, Scatman Crothers and John Lithgow starred.

TREE-PLANTING TO HONOR CESAR CHAVEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

trees Saturday along the newly designated Cesar E. Chavez Avenue in an effort 
to beautify the area and educate the public about the late farm-labor leader. 
</P>
<P>
 The planting will begin at 8 a.m. at Mednick Avenue and move west along Chavez 
Avenue to McDonnell Avenue.Organizers plan to plant 25 to 30 trees on both 
sides of the street. They will also pick up trash. 
</P>
<P>

Club, 325 N. McDonnell Ave., from noon to 3 p.m. Chavez's niece, Maria Elena 
Chavez, and other members of the United Farm Workers of America will speak. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council and County Board of Supervisors renamed Brooklyn Avenue, Macy 
Street and a portion of Sunset Boulevard in honor of Chavez this year.

GROUP SEEKS TO PUT MINORITY LOCATIONS ON TOURISM MAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration is scheduled to hold a three-day 
convention starting Thursday on ways to boost tourism and business in minority 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said the Multicultural Tourism Development Conference at the 
Biltmore Hotel, 506 S. Grand Ave., is the first such meeting to cover 
minority-related issues in tourism on a national basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping to encourage tourism development in multicultural enclaves 
throughout the U.S.," said Linda Harbaugh, senior policy analyst for the 
tourism administration. "People who return to the U.S. for visits -- they want 
to do something different. They've already gone to New York, Disney World." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to promoting ethnic communities to tourists, Harbaugh said, the 
conference will also encourage minorities living in those neighborhoods to open 
their own travel businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the goals of this administration, to assist minorities in 
business development," Harbaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials have already initiated some assistance in the Downtown area 
through the Minority Enterprise Growth Assistance Center, which offers free 
first-time business consultations to minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's tourism and development manager, Isabel Rodriguez, said this 
week's conference is timely in light of Los Angeles County's recent disasters 
and the riots two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1991 and 1993, for example, the number of tourists dropped 2%, from 
25.31 million to 24.85 million, according to the Los Angeles Convention and 
Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Tours in ethnic communities -- such as to the Mercado in East Los Angeles or a 
bilingual arts theater in Lincoln Heights -- could open a new market in travel, 
Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have to do is to dispel this myth that going into communities is 
dangerous," she said. "Our communities are very safe. They're there waiting 
with open arms to show off what they have." 
</P>
<P>
 The Multicultural Tourism Development Conference begins Thursday and ends 
Saturday. Registration is $325. Information: (213) 895-0224.

IT JUST WASN'T SAFE AT HOME; DARRYL STRAWBERRY HAD HIGH HOPES FOR HIS RETURN TO 
LOS ANGELES. HIS FRIENDS SAY PRESSURE GOT TO THE BALLPLAYER. 'I COULD SEE IT 
COMING,' ONE SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 The sweet-swinging savior. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way that Darryl Strawberry was heralded upon his return to Los 
Angeles in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry's unique blend of speed and power was supposed to make him L.A.'s 
new miracle worker when he was signed as a free agent by the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps those weight-of-the-world expectations are the reason he failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could see it coming," said Earl Brown Jr., a major league scout and a 
former Dodger farmhand. "You know, some players play well coming to their 
hometown and some can't take the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 On May 25, Strawberry, 32, and the Dodgers reached a financial settlement of 
$4,857,143 on the final one-plus years of his five-year, $20.25-million 
contract. In return, Strawberry relinquished the Dodgers from any contractual 
obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years of Strawberry's life, marred with back ailments, fans' jeers and a 
bout with substance abuse, was finally over. Strawberry, who recently completed 
a rehabilitation program at the Betty Ford Clinic in Rancho Mirage, moved to 
the Palm Springs area from his Glendale home. Strawberry could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Few felt the pain and anguish that the prodigal son experienced more than 
those at his alma mater, Crenshaw High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty sad what happened to his career in Los Angeles because he had 
such high hopes," said Brooks Hurst, who coached Strawberry from 1975 to 1981 
when he was a Cougar. "In high school, Darryl was always called upon to do the 
job and most of the time he did it. I think there was too much pressure on him 
at an early age." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry's talents were immense as a youngster. Scouts salivated at the 6-6, 
215-pounder's beautiful left-handed swing almost from his arrival at Crenshaw. 
Strawberry's high school batting average of .371 included four home runs as a 
junior and five as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 He was drafted and signed by the Mets, and after 3 1/2 years in the minor 
leagues, Strawberry was called up to rescue the parent team in 1983. He played 
for the Mets from 1983 to 1990, was selected the National League's 1983 Rookie 
of the Year and was part of the 1986 World Championship team. 
</P>
<P>
 After six All-Star seasons with the Mets, eight total, Strawberry made a much 
ballyhooed return to his hometown in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 It proved to be the biggest mistake of Strawberry's up-till-then sterling 
on-field career. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Darryl came back, he was really excited about playing in Los Angeles and 
seeing his former friends," former Crenshaw baseball star and major leaguer 
Chris Brown said. "But the (bad) element has been around and worked against 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who played for the San Francisco Giants, San Diego Padres and Detroit 
Tigers, worked out with Strawberry and former Dodger Eric Davis at Rancho Park 
last winter. The three were friends as teen-agers while playing for Earl Brown 
Jr. on a youth team called the Compton Moose. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Brown was impressed with Strawberry's work ethic and expected his friend 
"to have a super season in 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 But that scenario did not play itself out, largely because of Strawberry's 
fishbowl existence and those who swam in his circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry's friends "are from another world," said Earl Brown Jr. "They got 
as much money as he has but they got it the wrong way. He can't seem to shake 
them loose. He has to let them live their lives and he has to live his." 
</P>
<P>
 Earl Brown Jr. said he is disappointed that Strawberry allowed this negative 
influence back into his life: "Thing I feel badly about is that I trusted him. 
I went to see him play at Anaheim. I saw those guys and I knew they were 
hanging with him again." 
</P>
<P>
 Coupled with what some say were Strawberry's poor choices in running mates was 
a 1992 back injury that limited him to just 75 games over the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 He batted a paltry .235 with five home runs and 25 RBIs in 1992, and failed to 
play in 100 games for the first time since his rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
 After back surgery before the 1993 season, Strawberry continued to struggle on 
the field and at the plate. His average dipped to a career low .140 last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm troubled by the way the Dodgers handled his rehabilitation when he hurt 
his back," Hurst said. "They were trying to rehab a guy by making him stand 
around for 1 or 1 1/2 hours in the field and expect him to make a play. All 
that stress and finally they operate on him, which was inevitable. (The 
Dodgers) get Strawberry on the playing field after a short period of time. I 
know he tried to play hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Troubled by his poor play, Strawberry's off-the-field problems began to 
escalate, friends said. While on the disabled list, he missed a rehab session 
on June 25, 1993. Three months later, he was arrested for allegedly striking 
Charisse Simon, his live-in girlfriend. Simon did not file charges and the two 
were married Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 During the October brush fires, Strawberry said during a radio interview: "Let 
it burn. I don't live there any more." 
</P>
<P>
 On March 3, the IRS and U.S. attorney's office began to investigate 
Strawberry's alleged failure to file tax returns on more than $300,000 of 
income derived from autograph and memorabilia shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, however, did not talk publicly about releasing Strawberry until 
April 3, when he failed to show up for the Dodgers' final exhibition game 
against the Angels at Anaheim Stadium. The next day he announced he had a 
substance abuse problem and was put on the 15-day disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurst said he often visited Strawberry in the Dodger clubhouse and knew he was 
in serious pain when he first injured his back. He blames the Dodgers for not 
acting properly to treat his injury. "Doctors have been throwing dice with 
Strawberry's career and I think that led to his depression and substance 
abuse," Hurst said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Strawberry's slumping performance was not well received by Dodger 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Dodgers' first game back from Vero Beach, Fla., Strawberry was 
booed for misplaying a fly-ball-turned-double by Damion Easley of the Angels, 
and going hitless in four at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are his home people," Chris Brown said, "Imagine what it would be like 
going to work and having people boo you. It hurts your confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 This was the first pronounced negative response from fans in the spring, which 
had all been spent in the benign atmosphere of Florida, where Strawberry had 
flourished. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Brown said Strawberry did not consult his friends about his problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "He likes to keep things to himself. I told him I would always be there 
whether he made 20 cents or $20 million," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis and Renard Young, two of Strawberry's friends, could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Brown added that Strawberry would still be a member of the Dodger 
organization if the team was not doing well: "If the Dodgers weren't in first 
place, Darryl would be back. If they were in third place and hitting .218 as a 
team, he would be in the lineup. But the Dodgers have a left- and right-handed 
platoon of Henry Rodriguez and Cory Snyder who are doing the job. I'd rather 
have one person who can carry the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles' fans might not have been kind or even fair to Strawberry during 
his up-and-mostly-down career with the Dodgers. But those at Crenshaw, who know 
him best, are praying for Strawberry to just save himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish him the best of luck," said Crenshaw baseball coach Major Dennis. "I 
hope he comes back and plays somewhere. He is the best ballplayer I know."

COLUMN ONE; PUTTING A PRICE ON VIOLENCE; THE GUNFIRE LASTED ONLY SECONDS, BUT 
FOR TAXPAYERS THE COST SPIRALS ENDLESSLY. HERE'S A LOOK AT THE TOLL FROM ONE 
SHOOTING IN WHICH A 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL WAS LEFT PARALYZED.

<P>
 This is another sad tale from an often cruel city where, according to FBI 
statistics, residents are about twice as likely as the national average to 
become victims of violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, though, let's not look at the cost of the ongoing mayhem in terms 
of human suffering, but rather in dollars. This time, pull out your calculator 
and pity the taxpayers -- many of whom, because they live in areas less touched 
by it, still seem to figure that street violence is someone else's problem. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the story of one case, documented from court records and with 
interviews and reports from various agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 It began April 29, 1991, exactly one year before the city exploded into riot. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Rodriguez, then 12, had stayed home that day to interpret for her 
Spanish-speaking mother, who was taking one of Cindy's eight siblings to the 
dentist. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3:30 p.m., Cindy and her sister, Nancy, heard the mail carrier arrive in 
the parking lot of their building on Imperial Avenue in South-Central Los 
Angeles. Cindy expected a letter from a friend, so she and Nancy, then 15, ran 
out of their small apartment and watched as the carrier stuffed mail into the 
cluster of aluminum boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 At that moment, kitty-corner from the building, a tricked-out red Nissan 
Pathfinder entered the parking lot of Church's Fried Chicken. As with most such 
events, accounts of what happened next depend on who is telling the story, and 
from what perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 Roscoe Frederick, a crack dealer and alleged associate of a Blood gang set, 
says he and a friend pulled up to the drive-through window. Frederick says he 
was waiting for his fries with his window down, bumping "Nobody Beat the Biz" 
by rapper Biz Markie, when he noticed a guy by the restaurant door who seemed 
to be admiring his Pathfinder. 
</P>
<P>
 Frederick says he was just about to ask, "You like this?" when the restaurant 
door swung open and "a dude came out of the chicken place and fired three shots 
at me, boom-boom-boom. " 
</P>
<P>
 A teen-ager who was standing outside the restaurant -- we will call him Jim 
Smith -- had a different perspective. He says Frederick pulled into the lot, 
shouted an insult at someone near the restaurant and started shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, one bullet lodged in Smith's shoulder and another tore through the 
hip of the 15-year-old beside him, dropping him to the cement. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy and Cindy had already heard enough gunfire in their lives to guess the 
caliber of the shots that snapped and popped across the street. Nancy saw smoke 
rising from the gun of a youth she knew as "Little Man," a member of a local 
Crip gang set. She would later say she saw him dart into the street and run 
toward her. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy had seen gang skirmishes before. "I'm going home," she said, as the 
Pathfinder pulled from the lot and stopped in the middle of Imperial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's run for it, Nancy!" Cindy shouted. Instead, Cindy crumpled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get up!" Nancy ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nancy, I can't get up." 
</P>
<P>
 "Stop goofing off, get up," Nancy replied, leaning down, frightened. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt like my body was burning," Cindy says now. A .38-caliber, 
hollow-point bullet had entered her left side, near the stomach, sliced through 
her spinal cord at the third lumbar vertebra, and fragmented. The largest piece 
lodged in her clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt like there was a water hose in me with all the blood coming out," she 
recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Public coffers began hemorrhaging money as well, as the people connected by 
those bullets were caught in the numbingly complex tangle of lifelines and 
restraints thrown out by already overburdened institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no official tracking of the total volume of dollars it costs society 
after such an event. Many agencies involved are on duty anyway, so to calculate 
such spending is, in a sense, academic, and some of the figures that follow are 
speculative. 
</P>
<P>
 But imagine just this once that each time a dollar was paid, a societal 
overseer punched a button on a giant cash register, sounding a loud ca-ching.  
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes of the shootout, the city's emergency response system went to 
work. Two Los Angeles Police Department patrol units arrived at 3:55 p.m. and 
four officers began preliminary crime scene investigation No. DR 91-1813758. 
</P>
<P>
 A "Lifeforce" engine from city Fire Station 64 and rescue ambulances from 
Stations 33 and 65 pulled into the intersection, followed by a battalion chief 
and paramedics supervisor -- 11 fire personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4 p.m., an LAPD sergeant arrived, followed by three officers who began 
holding back the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the intersection swarmed with police, members of a third gang arrived 
to check out the action. When they spotted two young men from yet another gang 
set there gawking, they attacked with fists and tire irons. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're coming into our territory. That don't go!" one gangbanger shouted to 
a TV news crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the chaos, an LAPD patrol unit took Smith to the hospital, while 
ambulances hauled off Cindy and the 15-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambulances prorate their charges at about $6.85 a minute, which, including 
the run to Martin Luther King/Drew Medical Center, totaled $911. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire personnel's hours came to about $4,324, according to department 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Detective Raymond Monroy and his partner, Michael Calhoun, joined 
17 officers now on the scene (six others had arrived, assisted briefly, and 
left). Monroy took charge of the investigation, interviewing witnesses and 
gathering evidence. An LAPD photographer took pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Exclusive of Monroy and Calhoun's time, the expense to taxpayers for the 
police response, based on conservative estimates of per hour salaries 
cross-referenced with the crime scene log, comes to about $635. A forensic 
specialist cost another $42. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD dispatched a helicopter to try to spot the fleeing Pathfinder. Its two 
hours of use, including wages for the pilot and observer, cost $405. 
</P>
<P>
 Back on the ground, inside a web of yellow crime-scene tape, Monroy and 
Calhoun worked 24 hours straight on the investigation. According to figures 
supplied by public information Officer Arthur Holmes, the detectives' cost, 
exclusive of overtime, was about $1,307. 
</P>
<P>
 The total cost of that initial response? $7,624. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy had lost a lot of blood and slipped into shock as she was wheeled into 
the trauma center. A doctor removed her left kidney and parts of the 
hollow-point bullet. But fragments remained lodged in her spine. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Cindy awoke with tubes running down her mouth and nose and 
poking from her chest, and a colostomy bag at her side. She had no idea where 
she was. 
</P>
<P>
 A doctor entered the room trailing medical students. "She's a paraplegic," he 
announced. "She got shot. She's never going to walk again." 
</P>
<P>
 Those remarks, Cindy recalls, were her first indication of what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got shot?" she cried. 
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't know?" the doctor asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy spent six days in the intensive care unit, for which King billed the 
state Department of Health Services' Medi-Cal $2,632 a day. (The hospital's 
Medi-Cal contract allows for only a $920-a-day reimbursement, but the full 
costs are ultimately absorbed by the county facility and society.) From ICU, 
Cindy was wheeled into the pediatric unit, where she spent nine days at a per 
diem charge of $1,234. 
</P>
<P>
 The two other victims also underwent surgery at King. Smith was discharged the 
next day; the other youth May 1. If both lacked private insurance, the minimum 
estimated cost to taxpayers in Medi-Cal funds for them was $7,896. 
</P>
<P>
 The total for this first stage of the victims' hospital treatment: $34,794. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the shooting, a "citizen informant" called LAPD's South Bureau 
CRASH unit saying that the shooter was a hustler named "Roscoe." 
</P>
<P>
 A detective checked his files and found Roscoe Frederick. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroy went to King with a "six pack" photo lineup. Smith's arms were 
incapacitated, but he indicated that the driver -- the shooter, he said -- was 
the man in picture No. 5, Roscoe Frederick. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours before that interview, just shortly after the shooting, an employee of a 
Gardena body shop had watched Frederick wheel his Pathfinder into the garage. 
According to the man's later testimony, Frederick asked him to patch bullet 
holes in the door and side, fix a shattered rear window, and paint the red 
vehicle blue. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes after Frederick's arrival, the employee said, Brian Keith Cage, 
Frederick's stepbrother, arrived to give him a ride. The man said he watched 
Cage open the truck's door, pick up a handgun and slip it into his waistband. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, the employee saw a TV report about the shooting. His conscience 
and his good sense began a heated debate, he later told prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 When he had cooperated with police after another incident, the man said, gang 
members had kidnaped his brother. But the thought of a 12-year-old lying in a 
hospital got the better of him. He called Gardena police and told them about 
the bullet-riddled Pathfinder. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, April 30, was Frederick's 20th birthday. At 3 p.m., an LAPD stake-out 
team -- seven officers and a lieutenant, Monroy recalls -- set up inside the 
body shop and across the street. They left that evening when the shop closed, 
and returned the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, on May 2, Frederick arrived at 5 p.m. But the shop employees didn't 
recognize him, and he eluded the stakeout. At 7:30, two patrol officers spotted 
Cage and arrested him. On May 7, on his attorney's advice, Frederick 
surrendered to Monroy. With another warrant, police impounded and searched his 
Pathfinder. A police chemist, according to reports, found a bloodstain, a 
bullet, a casing and fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, the shooting's costs had spread like fragments of the hollow-tip 
bullet through the organizations and enterprises that have blossomed as a 
result of Southern California's relentless bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 The chemist's time cost about $42. Towing the truck cost $68. The officers' 
and lieutenant's time for the stakeout -- conservatively assuming that each was 
at the lowest pay scale -- came to about $4,771. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroy continued working the case, and estimates his and Calhoun's additional 
investigation costs at $1,118 through early May. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost of the additional investigation and arrests: $5,999. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 13, Cindy was transferred to Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center in 
Downey. The spinal injury had left her paralyzed, although she has some feeling 
in one leg. For 3 1/2 months, the Rancho staff worked on Cindy's 
rehabilitation, providing physical therapy, counseling and instruction, while 
continuing her junior high school education. 
</P>
<P>
 At a flat daily rate of $1,193, Rancho billed Medi-Cal $120,494 for Cindy's 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of July, 1991, Cindy returned home. By October, she had incurred 
another $4,209 in pharmaceutical expenses -- ranging from stomahesive paste to 
catheters and colostomy bags -- which Medi-Cal paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Between her release and the end of September, Rancho billed an additional $725 
for physical and vocational therapy and $1,175 in other medical services, 
according to a computer-generated bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Total cost of her additional treatment to this point: $126,603. 
</P>
<P>
 In early May, 1991, detectives Monroy and Calhoun went to the seventh-floor 
offices of the district attorney's hard-core gang unit at the Compton 
courthouse. Linda Bushling, one of 12 attorneys there, added the case to the 16 
or so murders and attempted murders she already juggled, and filed charges 
against Frederick: three counts of premeditated attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 County probation officers investigated Frederick and wrote a report, at the 
standard cost of $420. 
</P>
<P>
 Frederick was arraigned on May 13, and -- over Bushling's objections -- bail 
was set at $250,000. He remained in custody until family and friends raised the 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, meanwhile, began to move through the criminal justice system, 
racking up expenses to taxpayers virtually every day. Monroy, for example, 
estimates that he put in 30 to 50 hours keeping tabs on witnesses and tracking 
down details. Figuring the time at 40 hours, that's $1,118. 
</P>
<P>
 (Taxpayers were spared one expense: Both Frederick and Cage hired private 
attorneys.) 
</P>
<P>
 On June 24, 1991, Case No. TA012928 arrived for preliminary hearing before 
Judge Steven Suzukawa, in Division VI of Los Angeles County Municipal Court. 
Four witnesses -- Nancy, Smith, Monroy and the body-shop employee -- were 
called. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Bushling presented five exhibits, including photos of the 
Pathfinder and diagrams of the shooting scene. Testimony lasted one day and 
generated a 147-page transcript. According to an estimate by a budget analyst 
with the State Judicial Council, a day of court time in a felony preliminary 
hearing, including the judge's salary, ancillary personnel and paperwork, costs 
taxpayers $3,950. Monroy's time came to another $223. 
</P>
<P>
 The case file moved to Superior Court and began racking up notations that 
reflect its glacial progress: On July 8, 1991, the defendants pleaded not 
guilty. On Aug. 5, the case was continued. On Sept. 12, the court denied a 
motion to dismiss brought by the defense. On Sept. 23, Oct. 18, Oct. 29, Nov. 
19, Nov. 26 and Dec. 3, the court granted defense motions to continue the case. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Dec. 12, the court transferred the proceedings to Judge Thomas R. 
Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the first half of 1992, the case continued to dribble along on a 
string of continuances, as transcripts were prepared and the prosecutor or 
defense attorney reported scheduling conflicts. Bushling appeared in court on 
Jan. 9, 14, 15, Feb. 3, 14, 27, 28, March 6, April 8, May 11, June 11, 17, and 
July 1, 21 and 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatively figuring that each motion took 30 minutes of court time, that 
adds up to a prorated cost to the court of $5,916. 
</P>
<P>
 Total cost of the legal preliminaries: $11,627. 
</P>
<P>
 As the case progressed, local gang members, including friends of "Little Man," 
were not bashful about expressing their feelings to Cindy and her family, she 
says. Sometimes they would walk by and laugh at her as she sat in front of the 
family apartment in her wheelchair. They called the house and harassed her and 
Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
 During those months, body-shop workers also received threats from gang 
members, says Bushling: "They were terrified." 
</P>
<P>
 (In an unrelated incident some months after the shooting, Monroy says, a rival 
drug dealer shot and killed "Little Man" -- who was not charged in Cindy's 
shooting.) 
</P>
<P>
 Like so many people in high-crime areas, the Rodriguezes found the violence 
hurting them in other, unexpected ways. When Cindy lay in the hospital, her 
mother, Maria, a seamstress at the time, took off work for two weeks to be near 
her. Her sisters missed school. Her father, Jose, had recently lost his job as 
a silk-screen printer, and he took the shooting hard, staying by Cindy's 
bedside the whole time she was in ICU. 
</P>
<P>
 But he left the family soon after, Cindy says, her eyes tearing up. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks after Cindy was shot, a brother-in-law was killed in a gang-related 
incident, bringing more grief to her overwhelmed family. Families often 
disintegrate after violence, as the enormous emotional and economic stresses 
collide, says Paul Juarez, a researcher at King and past chairman of the 
Violence Prevention Coalition of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Caring for an injured child pushes already difficult circumstances to the 
breaking point, he says. And when a poor family loses its grip on financial 
security, society's costs can surge. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, no one in the Rodriguez family took advantage of financial 
assistance offered by the district attorney's victim assistance program, so the 
sole costs to taxpayers, prorated by the time worker Mary Sutton put in on the 
case, would be about $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 10, 1992, Frederick's case went to trial. Simpson seated 12 jurors and 
two alternates. A sheriff's deputy, deputy clerk and court reporter were 
present. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the circle of people drawn together to contend with the shooting were not 
immune to the larger epidemic it reflected. On the second day of the trial, the 
judge excused a juror whose brother had just been shot and killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bushling's first witnesses were Nancy and Cindy. She also called Detective 
Calhoun. Using material prepared by the district attorney's staff, she 
documented the state's case with 22 exhibits, including aerial photographs and 
an illustration of a bullet prepared by a forensic specialist. The estimated 
cost, excluding materials, was $213. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial lasted five days. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who had been shot in the shoulder, abruptly lost all memory of events, 
testifying to virtually every question: "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bushling, who had seen plenty of witnesses "go sideways," educated the 
jury on the realities of gang intimidation and impeached Smith with his own 
testimony from the preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2:01 p.m. on Aug. 18, the jury announced it had reached a verdict. They 
found Frederick guilty of premeditated attempted murder on a "John Doe," guilty 
on two counts of assault with a firearm on Cindy, and guilty on one count of 
assault with a firearm on Nancy. He was also found to have used a firearm, 
which added a mandatory four years to his term. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget about calculating the amount of money the jurors' employers paid to 
subsidize the time they were impaneled. Bushling estimates that she spent 87 
hours preparing the case -- not counting time she worked at home -- for a total 
expense of $5,428. 
</P>
<P>
 The detectives' time off the streets for the trial prorates to an estimated 
$2,178. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's salary and other court expenses total $19,750. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the trial to taxpayers: $27,889. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 14, Judge Simpson sentenced Frederick to life in prison with 
possibility of parole, tacking on four more years. He was moved to the state 
prison at Corcoran. 
</P>
<P>
 Frederick had already spent 56 days in county jail -- at a daily rate to 
taxpayers of $44.35 -- for a total of about $2,483. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts predict that unless his conviction is overturned or shortened on 
appeal, he will not receive a parole hearing for 15 years. The state Department 
of Corrections estimates the annual cost to taxpayers of incarcerating an 
inmate, exclusive of prison building costs, at $20,751 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 If Frederick is released after 15 years, his incarceration will have cost 
about $311,265, which doesn't take into account inflation or costs of his 
eventual parole. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I did was go get some chicken, then all this jumped up," Frederick said 
from prison. "When they took me to court, for my trial, my wife was six months 
pregnant. (Since then) she had my little daughter. . . . If I have to do all 
this time, she'll be out of high school by the time I come home." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Bushling had decided soon after Cage's arrest that it would cost 
taxpayers less to put him away for a probation violation from a cocaine-related 
conviction than to prosecute him as an accessory after the fact to the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge complied with that request, and he was sent to Wasco State Prison for 
a three-year sentence. Cage says he served 18 months, which translates to a 
cost to taxpayers of $31,126. 
</P>
<P>
 Frederick appealed his conviction; on Sept. 25, 1992, that process began. A 
state attorney general's spokeswoman said that figuring the costs of the 
appeals process is "just about impossible." But estimates are possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2nd District Court of Appeal oversaw 2,552 cases for fiscal year 1991-92. 
Support staff puts in an average of 22 hours per case (at about $90 an hour) to 
keep the complex filing process moving, according to an appeals court budget 
analyst. Average cost per case: $1,980. The cost per case for the judge's time 
averages about $1,120. 
</P>
<P>
 To file the "respondent's brief" on this particular appeal, Deputy Atty. Gen. 
Arthur H. Auerbach says that he put in 55 hours, at $85 an hour, for another 
$4,675. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1993, the court upheld Frederick's conviction and sentence, and 
the state Supreme Court denied his attorney's petition to hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Not factoring in the costs of inflation or pushing the appeal to the federal 
level, the taxpayer cost for incarceration and appeals is $352,649. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy, meanwhile, moved with her family to a house a few miles from the 
shooting site. As documented by a 45-page Medi-Cal computer printout, her 
incidental medical costs, administered at Rancho, King, County-USC Medical 
Center and other facilities over the last three years have come in fits and 
starts. The institutions billed Medi-Cal $8,916 for additional medical care and 
therapy. On top of that, Medi-Cal paid for $5,530 in medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Cressy, community liaison for Rancho's spinal cord injury project, cites 
estimates that someone with Cindy's level of injury spends an average of $1,596 
annually on equipment and maintenance alone, in 1988 dollars -- money that 
Medi-Cal will likely provide. Actuarial tables show that a person with her 
injuries has an expected life span of 71 years, says Monroe Berkowitz, a 
Rutgers professor and author of the book "Economic Consequences of Traumatic 
Spinal Injury." So Cindy's additional lifetime equipment-related bills will 
probably hit $90,972. 
</P>
<P>
 A partially paralyzed person pays, on average, $138 more per year in 
prescription drugs, for another lifetime total of $7,728, paid by Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy now participates in an anti-gang volunteer project with Los Angeles 
Teens on Target, a group coordinated by Dr. Luis Montes, one of her doctors at 
Rancho. Another community organization flew her to Washington, D.C., last year, 
where she attended President Clinton's inauguration as one of the hundreds of 
young "faces of hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy returned, however, to a future considerably different than the one she 
envisioned as a bright-eyed 12-year-old with fashion model dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 15, Cindy attends Locke High School. The Los Angeles Unified School 
District provides the bubbly adolescent with special education classes and 
counseling at an estimated added expense of $5,800 a year. If she graduates, as 
she plans to do, the additional cost to taxpayers for her education will come 
to $29,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy still hopes to work as a model. But, on the advice of counselors, she is 
also making backup plans. Her confident demeanor suggests that she will 
accomplish whatever she puts her mind to. But the fact is, someone with a 
disability such as hers has a harder time doing everything from getting dressed 
in the morning to feeding herself at night. 
</P>
<P>
 If she does work, actuarial tables show that a partially paralyzed woman will 
lose an average of $6,570 in wages a year in her lifetime. The Social Security 
Administration contributes $446 a month in Supplemental Security Income with an 
additional state benefit of $63.40. This payment is subject to potential 
reductions based on earned income and will vanish if she becomes able to walk. 
If not, taxpayers will be tapped for at least $348,156. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming neither a worst- nor best-case scenario, the total for such lifetime 
costs will likely come to about $490,302. 
</P>
<P>
 Six weeks ago, Cindy re-entered Rancho so surgeons could correct a spinal 
problem and, as she says, "mess with my kidney." An infection developed and she 
remained hospitalized for 28 days. The bill came to $33,404. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the year Cindy was shot, 677 children or teen-agers were wounded or 
killed in 583 separate drive-by shootings in the city, according to a USC 
study. And the LAPD reported 43,783 aggravated assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 Most injuries were less serious than Cindy's. Some were more so: 953 Angelenos 
were murdered, 771 of them in gang-related crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 One shooting shattered Cindy Rodriquez's life. 
</P>
<P>
 It will cost taxpayers about $1,091,768.

O.C. CANDIDATES DUKE IT OUT VIA LATE 'HIT PIECES' 
</P>

 Voters beware. There are only two days left before Tuesday's primary election. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the last week has been any indication, voters are being bombarded with 
last-minute "hit pieces," telephone calls and door-knocking volunteers 
delivering optimistic messages for campaigns that, in many cases, have been 
mostly negative. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Orange County Republican Party was complaining by week's end of being 
a victim of two bogus mailers from groups claiming to be affiliated with the 
party but endorsing some Democratic candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 In a final pre-election push, the candidates are focusing on several themes: 
illegal immigration, fear of crime, use of special interest campaign money, and 
alleged political corruption, all the while launching personal attacks against 
their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County, long known for its staunch conservatism, has picked up the 
distinction this year as the host of one of the nastiest June primary races: 
the three-way Republican matchup in the 70th Assembly District, where 
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) is stepping down to run for the 
state Senate. California Political Week, a newsletter, labeled this election 
battle "the hottest and perhaps most negative GOP primary in this election 
cycle. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 But the negative campaigning has not been limited to that race. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Republican battle for the 69th Assembly District in central Orange 
County, candidate Virgel L. Nickell sent out a mailer Friday in response to an 
anonymous hit piece that was distributed in the district last week and 
contained copies of Orange County and Colorado court records alleging that 
Nickell had not paid child support to his former wife and that she had applied 
for welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Nickell said in an interview Friday that he had never seen the records until 
they landed on his doorstep. He denied the allegation, saying his financial 
support for his family went beyond what was required. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nickell campaign went on the counteroffensive, mailing out to voters a 
letter signed by his current wife, Beverly. She stated in the mailer that her 
husband has "always provided for all of the children in the family. . . . It's 
a shame that some candidates are willing to make untrue statements to try to 
win an election." 
</P>
<P>
 Distribution of the court documents threatened the endorsement Nickell had 
received from the California Republican Assembly, a conservative organization 
that stresses "family values." 
</P>
<P>
 At first alarmed by the documents, the group quickly undertook its own 
investigation but found no record of a final court judgment against Nickell. 
After confronting the candidate, CRA state President Greg Hardcastle said the 
group could not determine whether the allegations were true and took no action. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone is going to (spread the allegations) they should also have the 
guts to put their name on it," Hardcastle said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other front-runner in the race, Anaheim businessman Jim Morrissey, was not 
behind the effort to discredit Nickell, said Mark Thompson, Morrissey's 
campaign consultant. However, after hearing that the CRA was looking into the 
matter, Thompson said, he went to the Orange County courthouse to review 
Nickell's court file. The campaign, he said, decided not to distribute any 
information found in the documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said the reason there was no final judgment against Nickell was 
because Nickell's ex-wife moved to another state. 
</P>
<P>
 The mere threat of a last-minute hit piece in the race for retiring County 
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder's 2nd District seat was cause for alarm among 
some of the candidates in a battle that has had more than its share of 
eleventh-hour campaign mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Word spread on Friday that Supervisor Roger R. Stanton was burning the 
telephone lines, trying to raise money for Huntington Beach Councilman Jim 
Silva, so that a last-minute mailer could be sent out. But Silva, who ended up 
loaning his campaign $30,000, said the money was needed to pay for material 
already sent out. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters in that supervisorial district already have received a wide array of 
hit pieces, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * A mailer titled "How to Steal an Election," sent by Huntington Beach Mayor 
Linda Moulton Patterson, claims that Silva and a third candidate, Haydee V. 
Tillotson, are the "handpicked" candidates of the Koll Real Estate Group, even 
though Moulton Patterson also was a past recipient of contributions from the 
company and its top executives. 
</P>
<P>
 * A "Taxpayer Scorecard" by Tillotson, which gives Silva and Moulton Patterson 
"Fs" based on their votes as council members. Tillotson, who has never held 
elected office, gave herself an "A" because she is a businesswoman and opposes 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Silva's mailer, which highlights Moulton Patterson's affiliation with the 
Democratic Party, even though this is a nonpartisan race, and Tillotson's ties 
to Wieder, who has been at odds with Orange County conservatives and broke with 
Republicans to support President Clinton's election in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * A mailer by John A. Thomas, a fourth candidate in the race, which criticizes 
Silva, Tillotson and Moulton Patterson for "fighting over thousands of special 
interest dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 70th Assembly District, the three Republicans seeking their party's 
nomination have proved their ability to dig into the pasts of their opponents. 
With little disagreement among the candidates on the issues, the campaigns 
focused on opponents' pasts to draw some distinctions. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, candidate Marilyn C. Brewer, a businesswoman, told a small group 
gathered for a candidates' forum that she had been warned that her opponents in 
the race might try to get some dirt about her from her high school sweetheart. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily for her, she told the Irvine audience, she married her high school 
sweetheart. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer said she has had to fight back charges that she was once a Democrat. In 
recent days, stickers with the word "liberal" have been glued on to some of her 
campaign signs in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 While Brewer defended herself, she also went on the offensive, claiming in a 
recent mailer that she is the only Republican in the race who has vowed not to 
accept a 37% pay raise recently approved for state legislators. That claim 
resulted last week in an admonishment from the Orange County GOP's ethics 
committee, since candidate Thomas G. Reinecke has pledged to donate the pay 
raise to charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, Reinecke held a news conference to complain that new Brewer mailers 
claiming he would take the pay raise had arrived in mailboxes, days after the 
admonishment. The mailers show Brewer is "thumbing her nose at the Republican 
Party ethics committee," his campaign spokesman said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer countered that her mail was prepared before the Tuesday ethics 
committee hearing, and was dropped before the committee reached a decision. But 
she maintains that Reinecke would in fact have to "take" the pay raise before 
he could donate it to charity, and said there's no guarantee that he would in 
fact give it away. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer also accused the third candidate in the race, Irvine Councilman Barry 
J. Hammond, of voting to increase municipal fees "by millions of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Reinecke, meanwhile, has spent several weeks questioning Brewer's conservative 
credentials, while also calling attention to Hammond's personal bankruptcy and 
other financial difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond this weekend mailed out a response to those and other charges, and 
attacked Reinecke and Brewer for the "ugly" attacks against him. 
</P>
<P>
 If Reinecke wins the election, he will have survived a weeks-long whisper 
campaign against him, accusing him of being sued for non-payment of his former 
girlfriend's supposed abortion. Reinecke confronted the issue early in the 
campaign and denied it, showing that the lawsuit was filed mistakenly by a 
doctor he had seen for a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Confused? 
</P>
<P>
 Angry might be a better word to describe Orange County Republican Party 
Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes' reaction after seeing two mailers that claimed to 
be from Republican-based groups but included endorsements for several 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republican Party does not endorse in the primary, and never endorses 
Democrats," Fuentes said in a statement. "I don't know how I can say it any 
more clearly."

CLINTON STEPS UP PRESSURE ON N. KOREA; ASIA: HE CALLS SANCTIONS 'VIRTUALLY 
IMPERATIVE.' JAPAN, S. KOREA BACK EFFORT AGAINST SUSPECTED NUCLEAR PROGRAM. 
PYONGYANG INSISTS CURBS WOULD BE 'DECLARATION OF WAR.' 
</P>

<P>
 President Clinton on Saturday stepped up efforts to increase diplomatic 
pressure on North Korea, calling it "virtually imperative" that the world 
community impose economic sanctions on Asia's nuclear renegade. 
</P>
<P>
 With British Prime Minister John Major by his side during a D-day appearance 
in Portsmouth, England, Clinton sought to quell talk of armed conflict, saying 
sanctions would be "clearly . . . not an act of war and should not be seen as 
such." 
</P>
<P>
 But North Korea's ambassador in Beijing, Chu Chang Jun, repeated warnings 
Saturday that "any kind of economic sanctions" against North Korea would be 
regarded as "a declaration of war." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, the United States, Japan and South Korea issued a unified call 
for economic sanctions after recent indications that North Korea may be 
concealing production of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The allies ended two days of talks Saturday, warning of "a serious situation 
on the North Korean peninsula," caused by Pyongyang's efforts to thwart 
inspections designed to determine how much plutonium North Korea possesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Secretary of State Robert L. Gallucci, flanked by a South Korean 
special ambassador and a senior official of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, said 
the three countries agreed that the U.N. Security Council must "urgently 
consider an appropriate response, including sanctions," to bring North Korea to 
heel. 
</P>
<P>
 In Seoul, South Korean government officials met in an emergency session 
Saturday and set up a task force to assess national military readiness. 
</P>
<P>
 President Kim Young Sam told reporters that U.S. and South Korean forces "are 
keeping a round-the-clock surveillance on the North's (military) movements," 
and he added that the two allies "are fully prepared and have enough military 
power ready to meet any emergencies." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has about 36,000 troops and an array of sophisticated 
weaponry, including Patriot antimissile batteries, stationed in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest swirl of rhetoric and diplomacy came two days after the director 
general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Hans Blix, told members of 
the Security Council that North Korea had shifted spent fuel rods inside its 
principal nuclear reactor in ways that would obscure any efforts to divert 
plutonium to manufacture nuclear bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 The revelation deepened suspicions about North Korea's nuclear intentions and 
added urgency to international efforts aimed at halting the nation's nuclear 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea maintains that its nuclear energy facilities have not been used to 
make weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials have said that in light of Blix's testimony, 
Pyongyang should allow IAEA inspectors to take samples and measurements at the 
nation's two major radioactive waste sites. That would give inspectors an 
alternative to analyzing spent fuel rods as a means of accounting for North 
Korea's weapons-grade plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we want them to do is keep their word," Clinton said Saturday. "There's 
still time for North Korea to avoid sanctions actually taking effect . . . but 
this is in their hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington hopes to escalate pressure gradually to persuade North Korea to let 
inspectors in. If Pyongyang still refuses to yield after an initial tightening 
of trade, the allies would press for a freeze on North Korea's financial 
transactions and, finally, for a cutoff of oil and food supplies, diplomats 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials acknowledged Saturday that negotiating a 
sanctions strategy that would both pinch North Korea and win the support of 
reluctant allies has proven a difficult and delicate task. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to win international backing for sanctions, the United States has 
pressed high-level contacts with Russia, as well as with China. Either country 
could veto any bid to impose sanctions on North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Both have been reluctant to go along with sanctions until further diplomacy 
has been tried. But Clinton Administration officials said they have begun to 
see signs of greater flexibility from both countries. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea reportedly is using diplomatic channels to try to persuade China, 
North Korea's last major ally, to support sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 China, meanwhile, has been trying to influence North Korea to make concessions 
that would avoid sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, a Chinese-backed newspaper in Hong Kong said China would stop food 
and fuel exports to North Korea in the event of sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Security Council may take up the sanctions matter this week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin has been pressing for a separate 
meeting, outside the Security Council forum, on the situation, and U.S. 
officials said such a huddle could "still be useful at some point." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.S. official said Clinton and Yeltsin agreed that Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher and Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev will get in 
touch to discuss "the issues involved in holding such a meeting."

FAA IGNORED WARNINGS ON 757 JET TURBULENCE; SAFETY: ACTION WAS URGED BEFORE 
FATAL CRASHES INVOLVING PLANES FOLLOWING TOO CLOSE. AGENCY HAS NOW MADE 
CHANGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BRAZIL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration's top scientist warned -- prior to two 
fatal airplane accidents -- that wake turbulence from Boeing 757 jetliners 
would cause a "major crash" if the agency failed to take preventive measures, 
internal documents show. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents reveal for the first time that experts within the FAA had -- 
before the tragedies in Billings, Mont., and Santa Ana -- expressed serious 
concerns about the potential danger to planes operating behind 757s. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven days before the Dec. 18, 1992, Billings crash killed eight people and a 
year before the Dec. 15, 1993, Santa Ana accident claimed five lives, chief 
scientist Robert E. Machol was granted a special meeting with the FAA's 
hierarchy and predicted a "catastrophe" because of 757 wake turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, it was not until after the Santa Ana accident that FAA Administrator 
David R. Hinson first drew nationwide attention to the problem, issuing a 
bulletin instructing air traffic controllers to routinely alert pilots to the 
threat posed by 757s. The plane's unique, fuel-efficient design creates 
invisible "horizontal tornadoes" emanating from each wingtip that are more 
powerful and last longer than those created by other aircraft its size. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true," Machol said in a recent interview. "I was the first guy within 
the agency who got up and said we're likely to have a catastrophe, a real 
catastrophe, probably involving a DC-9 or a Fokker, and lose 70 to 100 people, 
if we don't do something. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to speak to the associate administrators because I was scared." 
</P>
<P>
 The 226 pages of FAA letters and memoranda were obtained by The Times under 
the Freedom of Information Act after officials fought their release. An FAA 
spokesman said last week that the agency is investigating whether the records 
were withheld in violation of the federal disclosure law. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources have also provided The Times with documents indicating that agency 
officials were concerned about how Machol's warnings might be viewed. On one of 
Machol's memos, an official jotted a cautionary note that Machol should temper 
his words lest someone interpret the document to be a "smoking gun." 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA has resisted efforts to increase separation distances between 757s and 
tailing airplanes because it could potentially decrease the number of flights 
at airports. That could cut into revenues of the fiscally hobbled airline 
industry. Even mid-sized passenger jets such as MD-80s, DC-9s and Boeing 737s, 
which can carry 100 passengers or more, can be "rolled" and knocked out of 
control when they encounter the 757s' "wake vortex." The hazard is greatest 
during landing and takeoff, when the smaller plane can inadvertently fall below 
the 757's flight path and find itself entangled in a danger zone of swirling, 
hurricane-force winds. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Broderick, the FAA's associate administrator for regulation and 
certification, attended the Dec. 7, 1992, meeting and recalls Machol 
"expressing concern about wake vortices on a 757," he said. But Machol failed 
to provide "specific data" to justify the agency's immediate intervention, 
Broderick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet when Hinson recently announced new policies on 757s -- including a 
requirement that pilots of smaller planes landing behind 757s maintain an extra 
mile of distance -- no new data was presented, other than the two fatal 
accidents and three serious incidents over the past 18 months. Most of the new 
policies, which require air traffic controllers to be more cautious when 
dealing with planes trailing 757s, take effect this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, Broderick acknowledged, the FAA could have acted sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's certainly fair to say that these two tragic accidents caused us 
to place more emphasis on the wake vortex (research and development) project 
than we had in the past," Broderick said. The combination of the accidents, 
Machol's concerns and the existing research on 757s, he said, "convinced us 
that there were an awful lot of holes in our knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Garodz, a former FAA manager who expressed his concerns about 757 wake 
turbulence to the FAA in 1991 as a consultant, was surprised to learn that 
Machol had raised red flags on the agency's wake turbulence policies as far 
back as 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had their own guy saying the same thing and they still kept it quiet. 
That's amazing," said Garodz, a former fighter pilot who worked in the FAA's 
wake turbulence program for two decades before retiring in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Machol, who retired from the FAA on April 30, said it was not unusual that his 
warnings went largely unheeded. "Well, it is, in general, true that the FAA 
does not put a significant amount of time and money into something until they 
have a tragedy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting the sobering calculus that the FAA and the airline industry employ, 
Machol said that the 13 deaths in 18 months was not an alarming enough figure 
to prompt drastic action. "The 13? That's not much, really," he said. "We fly 
about 500 million people a year in the United States, and . . . about 100 (are 
killed), on average. That's not a bad number." 
</P>
<P>
 By its own admission, the FAA may have violated disclosure statutes by 
withholding the records in January and February when The Times requested them. 
The agency surrendered the records in May after the newspaper appealed the 
FAA's initial response to Hinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why the records were not released the first time, FAA spokesman Hank 
Price said: "We're determined to respond to that question. We've launched an 
internal investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Machol, who was involved in the FAA's initial response to The Times' FOIA 
request, believes the records may have been deliberately withheld, a charge 
Price said the agency could not confirm or deny at this juncture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I urged them to send it all . . . the first time around," Machol said. "Cliff 
Hay didn't want (The Times) to have them." Hay is manager of the FAA's wake 
turbulence program. 
</P>
<P>
 Hay denied opposing the release of any documents. "I had no part in 
restricting anything," he said. "It doesn't do us any good to withhold 
information." 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA has identified an additional 22 internal documents on the subject of 
757 turbulence but refuses to make them public, saying they are exempt under 
the disclosure law because they "contain advice, opinions and recommendations 
made by staff members in the course of reaching final positions." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the documents provided by the FAA, The Times obtained from independent 
sources an Oct. 3, 1989, memo suggesting the agency was sensitive to public 
perception on the issue of wake turbulence. The memo, written by Machol and 
addressed to the FAA's associate administrators for aviation safety and air 
traffic, quotes Machol as saying he did not understand why there were not more 
wake turbulence disasters, given the FAA's wake turbulence policies. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of the memo, someone had written by hand: "Bob: A note of caution 
-- please watch your wording -- I don't want 'smoking guns' in our files." 
</P>
<P>
 Machol, who remembered the memo when interviewed by The Times, declined to 
identify the author of the handwritten note. FAA officials said they are unable 
to determine who it was. The FAA's Broderick speculated that the author of the 
note simply objected to Machol's use of "unprofessional" language. 
</P>
<P>
 The records that were released by the FAA indicate that Machol, as far back as 
June, 1990, had urged the regulatory agency to increase spacing between 757s 
and trailing airplanes. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * A June 18, 1990, memorandum from Machol to the then-head of the wake 
turbulence program, citing a wake turbulence incident four days earlier 
involving a Simmons 206 aircraft and a 757. "We must do something about 
spacings behind 757s," Machol wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 * An Aug. 8, 1990, letter from Machol to Paul Thomas of Britain's Civil 
Aviation Authority in which Machol said the "757 has been the lead aircraft in 
a startlingly large number of wake-vortex incidents." 
</P>
<P>
 * An Oct. 25, 1993, report by Machol on wake turbulence in which he said: "If 
the lead plane is a 757 and the trailing plane is a light DC-9 at three miles," 
and certain weather conditions exist, "the situation could in my opinion be 
very dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 * Another passage in the same report refers to the special meeting Machol 
requested with high-level FAA officials before the 757-related accidents had 
occurred and contains his prediction: 
</P>
<P>
 "I lectured to the FAA's associate administrators on Dec. 7, 1992, on wake 
vortices and predicted a major crash within 10 years, most probably (an) . . . 
aircraft with tail-mounted engines behind a 757 at a high-altitude airport." 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven days later, the first of the two fatal 757 encounters happened at 
Billings, Mont., involving a Cessna Citation with tail-mounted engines; the 
plane involved in the Santa Ana accident a year later, a Westwind, also had 
tail-mounted engines. Among the five casualties in the Santa Ana crash were the 
top two executives of the In-N-Out Burger chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Transportation Safety Board in March urged the FAA to require 
minimum separation of four to six miles behind 757s, depending on the size of 
the trailing aircraft. But the FAA's new policy calls for only a three- or 
four-mile separation, depending on aircraft size. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy may be changed again after completion of tests on the 757 to 
determine whether more separation distance is warranted.

FAA IGNORED WARNINGS ON 757 JET TURBULENCE; SAFETY: ACTION WAS URGED BEFORE 
FATAL CRASHES IN O.C. AND BILLINGS, MONT., INVOLVING PLANES FOLLOWING TOO 
CLOSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration's top scientist warned -- prior to two 
fatal airplane accidents -- that wake turbulence from Boeing 757 jetliners 
would cause a "major crash" if the agency failed to take preventive measures, 
internal documents show. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents reveal for the first time that experts within the FAA itself had 
-- before the tragedies in Billings, Mont., and Santa Ana -- expressed serious 
concerns about the potential danger to planes operating behind 757s. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven days before the Dec. 18, 1992, Billings crash killed eight people and a 
year before the Dec. 15, 1993, Santa Ana accident claimed five lives, chief 
scientist Robert E. Machol received a special meeting with the FAA's hierarchy 
and predicted a "catastrophe" due to 757 wake turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, it wasn't until after the Santa Ana accident that FAA Administrator David 
R. Hinson first drew nationwide attention to the problem, issuing a bulletin 
instructing air traffic controllers to routinely alert pilots to the threat 
posed by 757s. The plane's unique, fuel-efficient design creates invisible, 
"horizontal tornadoes" emanating from each wingtip that are more powerful and 
last longer than those made by other aircraft its size. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true," Machol said in a recent interview. "I was the first guy within 
the agency who got up and said we're likely to have a catastrophe, a real 
catastrophe, probably involving a DC-9 or a Fokker, and lose 70 to 100 people, 
if we don't do something. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to speak to the associate administrators because I was scared." 
</P>
<P>
 The 226 pages of FAA letters and memorandums were obtained by The Times under 
the Freedom of Information Act, after officials fought their release. An FAA 
spokesman said last week that the agency is investigating whether the records 
were withheld in violation of the federal disclosure law. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources have also provided The Times with documents indicating that agency 
officials were concerned about how Machol's warnings might be viewed. On one of 
Machol's memos, an official jotted a cautionary note that Machol should temper 
his words lest someone interpret the document to be a "smoking gun." 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA has resisted efforts to increase separation distances between 757s and 
tailing airplanes because it could potentially decrease the number of flights 
at airports and cut into revenue of the fiscally hobbled airline industry. Even 
mid-sized passenger jets such as MD-80s, DC-9s and Boeing 737s, which can carry 
100 passengers or more, can be "rolled" and knocked out of control when they 
encounter the 757's "wake vortex." The hazard is greatest during landing and 
take-off when the smaller plane can inadvertently fall below the 757's flight 
path and find itself entangled in a danger zone of swirling, hurricane-force 
winds. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Broderick, the FAA's associate administrator for regulation and 
certification, attended the Dec. 7, 1992, meeting and recalled Machol's 
"expressing concern about wake vortices on a 757," he said. But Machol failed 
to provide "specific data" to justify the agency's immediate intervention, 
Broderick said. Yet, when Hinson recently announced a set of new policies on 
757s, including a requirement that pilots of smaller planes landing behind 757s 
maintain a greater distance, it came with no new "data" -- other than the two 
fatal accidents and three other serious incidents over the past 18 months. Most 
of the new policies, which require air traffic controllers to be more cautious 
when dealing with planes trailing 757s, take effect this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, Broderick acknowledged, the FAA could have acted sooner. "I 
think it's certainly fair to say that these two tragic accidents caused us to 
place more emphasis on the wake vortex R & D (research and development) project 
than we had in the past," Broderick said. The combination of the accidents, 
Machol's concerns and the existing research on 757s, he said, "convinced us 
that there were an awful lot of holes in our knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Garodz, a former FAA manager who expressed his concerns about 757 wake 
turbulence to the FAA in 1991 as a consultant, was surprised to learn that 
Machol had raised red flags on the agency's wake turbulence policies as far 
back as 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had their own guy saying the same thing and they still kept it quiet. 
That's amazing," said Garodz, a former fighter pilot who worked in the FAA's 
wake turbulence program for two decades before retiring in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Machol, who retired from the FAA on April 30, said it was not unusual that his 
warnings went largely unheeded. "Well, it is in general true that the FAA does 
not put a significant amount of time and money into something until they have a 
tragedy," he said of his former employer. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting the sobering calculus that the FAA and the airline industry employ, 
Machol said that the 13 deaths in 18 months was not an alarming enough figure 
to prompt drastic action. "The 13? That's not much, really," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, he said, "we fly about 500 million people a year in the United 
States, and we kill about 100, on average. That's not a bad number." 
</P>
<P>
 By its own admission, the FAA may have violated disclosure statutes by 
withholding the records in January and February when The Times first requested 
them. The agency surrendered the records in May after the newspaper appealed 
the FAA's initial response to Hinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why the records weren't released the first time, FAA spokesman Hank 
Price said: "We're determined to respond to that question. We've launched an 
internal investigation. Until we've done at least an internal audit, we don't 
have an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We take FOIA matters very seriously," Price said. "We're all very 
disappointed by this thing. There are very specific legal requirements on what 
can be withheld and it's very narrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Machol, who was involved in the FAA's initial response to The Times' FOIA 
request, said he believes the records may have been deliberately withheld, a 
charge Price said the agency could not confirm or deny at this juncture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I urged them to send it all . . . the first time around," Machol said. "Cliff 
Hay didn't want (The Times) to have them." Hay is the manager of the FAA's wake 
turbulence program. "I gave (Hay) my entire file," Machol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hay denied opposing the release of any documents. "I had no part in 
restricting anything," he said. "It doesn't do us any good to withhold 
information." 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA has identified an additional 22 internal documents on the subject of 
757 turbulence but refuses to make them public, saying they are exempt under 
the disclosure law because they "contain advice, opinions and recommendations 
made by staff members in the course of reaching final positions." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the documents provided by the FAA, The Times obtained from independent 
sources an Oct. 3, 1989, memo suggesting that the agency was sensitive to 
public perception on the issue of wake turbulence. The memo, written by Machol 
and addressed to the FAA's associate administrators for aviation safety and air 
traffic, at one point quotes Machol as saying he didn't understand why there 
weren't more wake turbulence disasters given the FAA's wake turbulence 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the present time I do not understand why we have so few catastrophes," 
Machol wrote. "It is true that since the DC-9 went down in Fort Worth in 1973 
(killing all aboard), we have not had a large aircraft crash because of a wake 
vortex encounter; but we have had a number of fatalities in GA (general 
aviation) and commuter-type aircraft, and a number of vortex encounters . . . 
where 'coffee was spilled, but not blood.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of the memo, someone has written by hand: "Bob: A note of caution 
-- please watch your wording -- I don't want 'smoking guns' in our files." 
</P>
<P>
 Machol, who remembered the memo when interviewed by The Times, declined to 
identify the author of the handwritten note. FAA officials said they are unable 
to determine exactly who it was. The FAA's Broderick speculated that the author 
of the note simply objected to Machol's use of "unprofessional" language. 
</P>
<P>
 The records that were released by the FAA indicate that Machol, as far back as 
June, 1990, had urged the regulatory agency to increase spacing between 757s 
and trailing airplanes. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * A June 18, 1990, memorandum from Machol to then-head of the wake turbulence 
program, Rick Page, citing a wake turbulence incident four days earlier 
involving a Simmons 206 aircraft and a 757. It reads, in part: 
</P>
<P>
 "Possible injuries to a flight attendant on Simmons 206 . . . after the pilot 
almost lost control of the aircraft due to wake turbulence while on approach to 
Chicago O'Hare Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must do something about spacings behind 757s." 
</P>
<P>
 * An Aug. 8, 1990, letter from Machol to Paul Thomas of the United Kingdom's 
Civil Aviation Authority in which Machol said the "757 has been the lead 
aircraft in a startlingly large number of wake-vortex incidents." 
</P>
<P>
 * An Oct. 25, 1993, report by Machol on wake turbulence in which he said, "If 
the lead plane is a 757 and the trailing plane is a light DC-9 at three miles," 
and certain weather conditions exist, "the situation could in my opinion be 
very dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 * Another passage in the same report refers to the special meeting Machol 
requested with high-level FAA officials before the 757-related accidents had 
occurred and contains his prediction: 
</P>
<P>
 "I lectured to the FAA's associate administrators on Dec. 7, 1992, on wake 
vortices and predicted a major crash within ten years, most probably a . . . 
aircraft with tail-mounted engines behind a 757 at a high-altitude airport." 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven days later, the first of the two fatal 757 encounters happened at 
Billings, Mont., involving a Cessna Citation with tail-mounted engines; the 
plane involved in the Santa Ana accident a year later, a Westwind, also had 
tail-mounted engines. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the five casualties in the Santa Ana crash were the top two executives 
of the In-N-Out Burger chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the FAA's files: a reprint of a 1991 article from the Flight Deck, a 
publication of the American Pilots Assn., in which the pilot of a DC-9 
recounted a run-in with 757 wake turbulence. The pilot, Capt. Steve Johnson, 
concluded: 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my opinion that . . . separation standards are not adequate when 
following 757 aircraft." 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview from his Washington area home, Machol said he had 
based his 1992 prediction on British reports of scores of 757 turbulence 
encounters dating back to the early 1980s when the 757 was first released. "I 
was concerned about a DC-9 going down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, on Nov. 24, 1993 -- three weeks before the Santa Ana crash -- 
Machol sent a report to the FAA's director of the Office of International 
Aviation and characterized the 757 as a special problem that needed to be 
addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the two fatal 757-related accidents that have occurred since December, 
1992, the National Transportation Safety Board has investigated at least three 
other serious incidents involving 757 turbulence. The NTSB recently released 
its report on one of the three incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 It involved a Boeing 737 carrying 133 passengers that performed an 
"uncommanded roll" while landing behind a 757 at Stapleton International 
Airport in Denver. Only moments from touch-down, the plane was flying at an 
altitude of 1,000 feet when it suddenly and violently banked left and plummeted 
200 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The 737 captain, Lynn T. Williams, 48, told investigators he feared the plane 
would flip over before he and co-pilot Bruce R. Forbes, 37, were able to regain 
control of the craft, abort their approach and circle back for a successful 
landing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to say that whatever caused this incident scared the hell out of 
both of us," Capt. Williams said of his co-pilot in a written statement to the 
NTSB. "I was not sure that this aircraft was going to remain right side up." 
</P>
<P>
 Based in part on such harrowing accounts, the NTSB in March urged the FAA to 
require minimum separation distances of between four to six miles behind 757s, 
depending on the size of the trailing aircraft. But the FAA's new policy calls 
for only a three- or four-mile separation depending on aircraft size. The 
additional mile of spacing is an interim measure until results of tests on the 
757 show whether more separation distance is warranted. Asked if the new 
policies would make it safe, the FAA's Broderick paused and said, "It's as safe 
as we know how to make it given the data that we've got."

NOT ALL BOSNIAN SERBS BACK REBELS; MANY LOATHE THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To some Bosnian Serbs, the bushy-haired psychiatrist who claims to be their 
political leader evokes potent emotions of resentment, anger and disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 While the outside world sees Radovan Karadzic as the defender of Serbian 
interests in this savaged republic, many of those he claims to speak for 
condemn his nationalist course and accuse him of destroying their country. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, he is not a president but a war criminal," says housewife Gordana 
Kitic, squeezing the air out of a collapsible baby bottle as she prepares to 
feed her 3-month-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He represents only a minority of Serbs in Bosnia," insists biology professor 
Ljubomir Berberovic, poking at a sheaf of statistics contending that a greater 
number of his fellow Serbs have fled the country or remained loyal to the 
Sarajevo government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who elected him? No one. So why does the world accept him as our leader?" 
asks publisher Gavrilo Grahovac, a look of incredulity coming over his bearded 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 Grahovac and other Serbs who reject the aggressive, segregationist course 
charted by Karadzic concede that they know very well why the world deals with 
the rebel leader accused of committing atrocities in pursuit of ethnically 
"pure" territory for Greater Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of whether they are legitimate representatives or renegades, 
Karadzic and his nationalist patrons control the awesome arsenal of the 
Yugoslav army. 
</P>
<P>
 In the might-makes-right reality of the Balkans in this third year of war, the 
voices of moderation are routinely drowned out by those whose words are 
punctuated with gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite their lack of military clout, Bosnian Serbs who have refused to 
side with their bellicose brethren have banded together and insist on at least 
a peripheral role in international efforts to resolve Bosnia's crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Grahovac and other members of a newly constituted Bosnian Serb Assembly have 
traveled to Moscow and to West European capitals to explain their objections to 
ethnic partitioning, and some international mediators are now weighing their 
views along with those of Karadzic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've proposed to all the negotiators that they at least stop dealing with 
Karadzic as the sole representative of the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina," says 
Mirko Pejanovic, a vice president of Bosnia and president of the Bosnian Serb 
Assembly. "I think there is a growing acceptance that he does not speak for all 
of us." 
</P>
<P>
 An inaugural session of the Serb Assembly in March was attended by U.S. 
special envoy for the Balkans Charles Redman, as well as by the American, 
British, French and other ambassadors recently posted to Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats report that their governments are in a quandary about how to deal 
with the rival Bosnian Serb faction, particularly since they find the 
assembly's support for a multicultural Bosnia more politically palatable than 
the nationalists' bloody quest for ethnic segregation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We support their views, but we have to recognize they have no power," one 
senior Western envoy said of the loyalist Serbs. "The reality is that Karadzic 
has the weaponry and the JNA (Yugoslav army) behind him, which is a factor that 
cannot be ignored." 
</P>
<P>
 Berberovic, who was the last rector of Sarajevo University before education 
was disrupted by the Serbian rebellion against independence in April, 1992, has 
compiled an analysis of the fate of Bosnia's Serbs. He has concluded that 
Karadzic is supported by only a small and subjugated minority. 
</P>
<P>
 His research contends that of the 1.4 million Serbs in prewar Bosnia, at least 
350,000 took refuge in Serbia, mostly to escape the hazards of rebel artillery 
attacks against the integrated towns and cities they lived in. 
</P>
<P>
 Records of the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, responsible 
for feeding and providing shelter for the displaced, suggest that this estimate 
is not far off. A report compiled by the U.N. agency late last year set the 
number of Bosnian refugees in Serbia at 322,000, nearly all of them ethnic 
Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 1.2 million Bosnian refugees who scattered beyond the former Yugoslav 
federation, at least one-third are thought to be Serbs. Presumably, Berberovic 
says, many fled in opposition to the nationalist attacks on their fellow 
Bosnians or to escape being conscripted into the rebel army. 
</P>
<P>
 Berberovic also claims that 100,000 Bosnian Serbs have been killed in 
rebel-held territory over the course of the war and that at least 150,000 Serbs 
remain in those areas of Bosnia still under government rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Those figures, however, are regarded by foreign aid agencies and diplomats as 
somewhat inflated. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the number of refugees, fatalities and loyalists, Karadzic rules 
over only about 500,000 Bosnian Serbs, Berberovic argues. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Sarajevo high school teacher Bozo Djondovic notes that not all of 
those in government territory are remaining there of their own free will. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people, and not only Serbs, who can't wait to leave this 
city," says Djondovic, who like all adult men in the Bosnian capital is 
prevented from leaving by a wartime security order. "I still wouldn't go to 
Karadzic's side. My family is in Montenegro, and I would go to join them in a 
minute if I could. It will not be much better there, but it couldn't be as bad 
as it is here." 
</P>
<P>
 Djondovic holds Karadzic and the Muslim-led Bosnian government in equal 
measures of contempt. It was his objection to the nationalist course that 
compelled him to stay in Bosnia at the start of the siege, even though he sent 
his wife and children out of the city for their own safety. But he accuses the 
government of bungling the defense of the country and contends that life for 
many Serbs here has become unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
 "My neighbor is married to a Serb, and the kids in the street call his 
children Chetniks," he says, referring to the label often employed to 
distinguish rebels from the rest of the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chetniks were nationalist warriors, loyal to the Serbian king, who gained 
a reputation for brutality during both world wars. Some of the more aggressive 
Serbian nationalists refer to themselves as Chetniks. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the current rebellion has inflicted such bloodshed and hardship on the 
country, non-nationalist Serbian activists believe many of their countrymen 
living behind rebel lines are less than ardent supporters of Karadzic and his 
army. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Serb Assembly proclaimed its aim of restoring Bosnia's territorial 
integrity and restated its commitment to ethnic tolerance, an anti-nationalist 
underground movement based in the rebel stronghold of Banja Luka contacted the 
Serbian loyalists in Sarajevo through a circuitous network of supporters 
reaching as far as Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there are some brave enough to risk contacting us, we have to assume that 
there are a lot of people who don't support Karadzic but are too frightened to 
show any sign," says Stevo Latinovic, a Serbian journalist working for Bosnia's 
government-controlled radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Three times a week, the radio network broadcasts news and commentary 
specifically aimed at informing those behind rebel lines about conditions in 
the rest of Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know what their media are like. We just pretend they don't exist," 
Latinovic says of the propagandistic rebel broadcasts. "We are trying to be 
objective and keep our assessments unemotional. We just want to inform people 
while maintaining our professional dignity. We are not aiming to bring about 
any more hatred." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Serbs opposed to Karadzic believe that nostalgia for the prewar 
ethnic harmony of Bosnia is growing behind the lines. However, others say their 
colleagues are deluding themselves because the force of the nationalists' 
message has been overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 Grahovac has a sister in the fiercely nationalist city of Banja Luka who has 
made no effort to reach him through more than two years of war. 
</P>
<P>
 "She could have contacted me through the Red Cross. She knows how Sarajevo has 
been destroyed. Maybe on a political level she can think we deserved it. But on 
a personal level she should want to know that her brother is in that city and 
still alive," Grahovac says sadly, verging on tears. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the force of nationalist propaganda is powerful enough to turn one 
member of a family against another, he asks, what chance do the moderates have 
to combat it?

AT GRAVESIDES, CLINTON SALUTES D-DAY 'KNIGHTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton looked skyward on a sodden English morning Saturday to 
salute the Allied airmen who mastered the skies over Europe in World War II at 
a grievous cost in lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in a steady drizzle before a field of crosses at the Cambridge 
American Cemetery and Memorial, Clinton honored the pilots, bombardiers and 
ground crews who "walk among us or lie among us today." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton called the airmen "knights borne on wings" and said they helped turn 
the tide of the war and made possible the D-day landings that he has journeyed 
to Europe to commemorate. 
</P>
<P>
 The lush Cambridge cemetery holds the graves of 3,812 Americans and 
memorializes more than 5,000 others officially listed as missing in action. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the names enshrined on the Wall of the Missing are those of 
bandleader-turned-airman Glenn Miller, whose flight vanished in 1944, and 
Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., the older brother of President John F. Kennedy. Joseph 
Kennedy was a Navy pilot killed when his plane blew up during a special bombing 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "America gave to England an infusion of arms and men and materiel," Clinton 
said. "The British gave our troops the feeling that they were not so far from 
home after all. The British gave us inspiration; the Americans gave, in return, 
hope. At every level, Yanks and Brits worked together like family." 
</P>
<P>
 England was the second stop of Clinton's three-nation trip to commemorate 
D-day. The President earlier visited Italy and is to cross the English Channel 
to France today. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the somber and restrained memorial event at the American cemetery at 
Nettuno, Italy, on Friday, Saturday's commemorative events had an almost 
festive feel. An Air Force ensemble entertained the guests with Miller swing 
standards such as "Moonlight Serenade," "In the Mood" and "St. Louis Blues 
March." 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials and politicians worked the crowd before Clinton and 
British Prime Minister John Major spoke. The ceremony ended with a flyover by 
vintage aircraft, including a lumbering B-17 bomber as well as a British 
Spitfire and an American P-51 Mustang zooming through acrobatic maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
 As they left the memorial service, Clinton and Major walked among guests, 
shaking hands and posing for pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 In his remarks, Major spoke of the "invasion" of England by GIs preparing for 
the landings on the Continent. He noted that, just before D-day, more than 1.5 
million soldiers and airmen were based on British soil under Supreme Allied 
Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a while," Major said, "every 30th person in Britain was an American 
serviceman." And he recalled the sacrifice they made to free Europe from 
tyranny -- 150,000 lives in the European theater, including 57,000 airmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We remember today why those lives were given. Those who came here from 
America were not, as we were, protecting their homes and families," Major said. 
"They didn't come here for national glory, not for profit, not for material 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came, many of you here today came, above all, to defend the values which 
Britons and Americans hold sacred: to defend freedom and democracy, justice and 
human rights," the prime minister said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most affecting remarks of the day came from a former B-24 bomber 
pilot who flew 35 missions over Nazi-held territory, including the vital 
Ploesti oil fields in Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot -- 73-year-old Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen -- said that during 
the war "boys grew into men far too fast." 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled the daily routine of the flight crews: "Scared? Of course. Anyone 
who wasn't was either a fool or didn't have any imagination. . . . Numbing 
fatigue. Faceless danger. Fiery death. Those were an airman's constant 
companions. In the face of this, these men not only flew and fought, they 
soared and triumphed." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Major met privately afterward at Chequers, the prime minister's 
country house near Oxford. The two leaders said they discussed 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and agreed that they will continue to press all sides to 
settle the territorial issues still in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Major said that continued fighting would yield no significant territorial 
gains and would only "continue to strain international patience." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither he nor Clinton said what they are prepared to do about the 2-year-old 
civil war in the former Yugoslav republic if their patience actually runs out. 
</P>
<P>
 From Chequers, Clinton traveled by motorcade to a hotel 15 minutes away for a 
brief courtesy call on Margaret Beckett, the acting leader of Britain's 
opposition Labor Party. She assumed the leadership of the party last month 
after the sudden death of party leader John Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Clinton attended an elaborate garden party and a formal dinner hosted 
by Queen Elizabeth II in the English Channel city of Portsmouth, one of the 
chief jumping-off points for invasion forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The entertainment included U.S. Air Force personnel dancing the Lindy Hop and 
British sailors in a rigging and climbing exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at times difficult, amid all the distractions, to remember the 
solemnity of the occasion that thousands were gathered to commemorate. 
</P>
<P>
 The queen, in a rare speech at the black-tie dinner for visiting dignitaries, 
reminded her guests of the sacrifice of those who fought for liberation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many veterans will be in Normandy themselves, retracing their steps up the 
beaches and beyond, amidst altered landmarks. Others will prefer to remember 
quietly their comrades who fell that day," the queen said. "For, lest we 
forget, there were some 10,000 casualties on D-day itself." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that today's generations must keep faith with those who landed on the 
beaches and those who prayed for their success. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is up to us to make sure that the prayers of 50 years ago are truly 
answered, by rededicating ourselves to the creation of a world at peace," the 
queen said.

O.C. SCHOOL STRUGGLES WITH STIGMA OF TB; HEALTH: SOME CARRIERS AND NON-CARRIERS 
ARE MADE TO FEEL LIKE OUTCASTS. OTHERS SAY IT'S BROUGHT THEM CLOSER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 La Quinta High School students have developed a ghoulish parody of their 
familiar "spirit" cheer. It goes, "We got TB, yeah, yeah. We got TB, yeah, 
yeah. We got cough, cough, cough, cough . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Dark humor is the students' weapon of defense against public ignorance about 
the disease that has branded their school, said Jim Perry, the school athletic 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta students and staff say that since last year, when health authorities 
reported an outbreak of tuberculosis on campus, they have been deeply hurt, 
even outraged, by the community's reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a very good school both academically and athletically, and it is the 
first time anyone has bloodied our nose like this unfairly," said John 
Alexander, an English teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta's distress stems from the fact that, according to county health 
authorities, it has been the site of the largest outbreak of drug-resistant 
tuberculosis of any high school in the nation. Nearly 200 have tested positive 
for the bacteria over the past year, and all students and teachers are 
currently being retested. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past year, the students and faculty have become well-educated about 
the disease, which once was nearly eliminated in the United States but is again 
resurfacing in Orange County and throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 They have learned TB is spread through the air by coughing and talking. But 
they are calmed to know, they say, that everyone at the school who was 
diagnosed with active disease is no longer contagious after taking medication 
that kills the bacteria in their sputum. And they have been assured by public 
health workers that the many others who skin-tested positive -- but who have no 
active infection in their lungs -- also are not contagious. 
</P>
<P>
 Their only regret, they say, is that the public is not as well educated. 
</P>
<P>
 Students and faculty relate a litany of instances when they have been treated 
like modern-day lepers: 
</P>
<P>
 The teacher out at the movies who noticed two women in the ticket line step 
back fearfully when they saw his La Quinta Aztec blue and gold baseball cap. 
The visiting swim team that fretted about catching tuberculosis in the pool. 
The customer who walked out of a restaurant as soon as their waitress said she 
attends La Quinta. The countless times outsiders have callously referred to La 
Quinta as "the tuberculosis school." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the sharpest slights, they said, occurred a week ago at the 
quarterfinals of the southern section of the California Interscholastic 
Federation baseball playoffs. Several days before the game, some parents and 
the principal at the competing school, St. John Bosco High School in 
Bellflower, called La Quinta Principal Mitch Thomas to make sure the campus was 
safe for Bosco's students. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Goodman, St. John Bosco's principal, said he knew enough not to be 
concerned that La Quinta students were contagious but called to appease 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately the game was played, and La Quinta won by a score of 10-2. But La 
Quinta fans were distressed to see that several of the visiting spectators wore 
surgical masks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gave the impression that we were somehow infectious," said Jodi Richerson, 
mother of a junior at La Quinta who was there. "The students are upset that 
anyone would think they would knowingly infect anybody," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then at Garden Grove's Strawberry Festival parade, Richerson said, she walked 
the parade route beside the La Quinta band in which her 16-year-old daughter 
marched as a cheerleader, and listened to the comments of spectators as the 
marchers passed by. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some said things such as 'turn your heads or you might get tuberculosis,' " 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was last fall that county health authorities reported that an outbreak of 
tuberculosis had reached alarming proportions at La Quinta. They said 17 
students within the 1,300-member student body had been found to have active 
tuberculosis since 1991, including 12 who shared the same drug-resistant 
strain. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of skin tests, culminating with screening of the entire student body 
last September, found that 175 more students tested positive for the TB 
bacteria, meaning they had non-active TB bacteria in their systems that could 
develop into active disease in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The contagious students were treated with drugs to make them not contagious, 
and the bacteria-exposed students were placed on a six-month preventive 
medication regimen, with drugs administered routinely by nurses on campus. 
Publicity about the TB outbreak subsided. 
</P>
<P>
 But the school once again gained notoriety when Debi French, a senior, in 
February suffered a relapse of highly drug-resistant TB and was forced to go to 
Denver for specialized treatment. When first-line drugs failed to cure her, 
French was put on a group of backup drugs and finally had part of a diseased 
lung removed last month. Her family said she is expected to return to her 
Westminster home today and hopes to return to La Quinta next year make up 
missed classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Orange County Health Care Agency conducted limited testing of 
French's closest contacts and found that 18 students and two teachers had 
become positive for TB exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequently, they ordered another round of campuswide TB testing, set for 
this week. But most at La Quinta seem to be taking the newest TB threat in 
stride. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, the school's principal, said that although the students are "a little 
annoyed by having to go through it again, they understand the medical need and 
reason." He said the parents of three students have informed him they may 
withdraw the students from the school for fear of a TB recurrence. But so far 
no students have left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the kids are pulling together. Spirits are good, considering the 
circumstances," Thomas said. Late last week, he said, the tuberculosis issue 
was overshadowed by student excitement and anticipation of the baseball game 
Saturday against West Torrance High School for the CIF southern section 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Several students said they feel confident that the county health officials are 
taking every precaution to protect them from another tuberculosis outbreak. 
Some said their classmates have become better friends by talking about TB, even 
comparing skin tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has brought the school together. Everyone has had to face it," agreed 
Jennifer Chapman, 18, the student body president. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the concerns many of the students share, they said, is whether they will 
be discriminated against in seeking summer employment. "I am looking for a 
summer job, and I worry about that," said Tram Nguyen, a senior who tested 
positive last year for the TB bacterium and has completed her TB-prevention 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Students say that not only strangers, but some members of their own families, 
have become nervous about contracting tuberculosis from them. Tamisha Jackett, 
17, said that although her TB skin tests were negative, her sister has told her 
she may no longer kiss her year-old nephew or blow on his food to cool it. 
</P>
<P>
 Some faculty, meanwhile, worry that the school enrollment may fall if 
youngsters in the community who are unduly fearful of the TB outbreak choose to 
bypass La Quinta to attend other schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Richerson, the parent of a La Quinta cheerleader, said that in the wake of the 
new testing, it is likely that the school will have to forgo the pancake 
breakfasts and spaghetti dinners that have been strong fund-raisers in the 
past. "I don't think people are going to want to eat at the school," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really understand what a stigma is now," she added. "I don't think the way 
some of these students are treated is different from the way people with AIDS 
are treated." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hugh Stallworth, the county public health officer, said authorities "have 
not determined there is anyone at La Quinta who is communicable with 
tuberculosis." He stressed that even the 18 students and two teachers who newly 
tested positive for the TB bacteria, had normal chest X-rays, so they are not 
infectious. "There is nothing that the community should worry about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the stigma persists. Last month, visiting spectators at a boys' volleyball 
playoff shouted to the competing team: "Don't go near the net!" Perry, the 
athletic director, said he was at first tempted to "run up and smack them." But 
then he reflected on the situation, he said, and thought, "It is a shame that 
they are that ignorant and misinformed."

PAPER TRAIL IN ARGENTINE ARCHIVES TRACES NAZIS' STEPS; SOUTH AMERICA: 
PREVIOUSLY SECRET DOCUMENTS REVEAL NETWORKS THAT HELPED PROTECT THIRD REICH 
KILLERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When ABC Television aired Sam Donaldson's in-your-face interview with Erich 
Priebke early in May, the U.S. network not only revealed the presence of an 
accused Gestapo war criminal in southern Argentina. It also put a prime-time 
spotlight on this South American country's shadowy role as a haven for World 
War II Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
 Priebke, a former German SS captain who participated in the execution of 335 
Italian civilians in 1944, has lived peacefully and quietly in Argentina since 
1948. 
</P>
<P>
 He and hundreds of other Nazis who came to South America after the war found 
anonymity and security, precious commodities for men who were hated and hunted 
elsewhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 How Third Reich killers and collaborators were able to hide out in this 
country is now becoming increasingly clear: In the last two years, the 
Argentine government has opened previously secret archives to researchers who 
want to trace the steps of Nazis in this country. And as the painstaking 
research proceeds, under the auspices of Argentina's Jewish community, it is 
turning up documents that detail a historical pattern of tolerance and 
complicity on behalf of fugitive Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a network of protection -- if not legal, at least bought -- that 
made it very difficult to find them and bring them to justice," said Ruben 
Beraja, leader of the Delegation of Argentine Israelites Assns., which is 
sponsoring the research dubbed "Project Testimony." 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly how the protective systems worked and who was involved have long been 
a subject of speculation. Nazi-hunters have discovered some of the puzzle's 
pieces over the years as they tracked down war criminals in Argentina, 
including the notorious Adolf Eichmann. 
</P>
<P>
 But important information in the form of official documents -- diplomatic 
notes, police reports, administrative memoranda -- was largely out of reach 
until Project Testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the documents uncovered have yet to be catalogued and 
cross-referenced, researchers showed The Times copies of hundreds of pages 
containing intriguing information on notable Nazi figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the documents show that Nazis entered Argentina with travel papers 
issued by the International Red Cross, reinforcing allegations of Red Cross 
negligence or complicity in the flight of Nazi war criminals to South America. 
</P>
<P>
 Red Cross officials now say that it was not the organization's job to 
investigate applicants for travel documents. 
</P>
<P>
 An Argentine Federal Police memorandum from 1964 notes that death-camp doctor 
Josef Mengele "entered the country on 20 May, 1949, carrying passport No. 
100,501, issued by the International Red Cross in the name of Gregor Helmut." 
</P>
<P>
 That document also shows that German authorities were also careless, at the 
very least, in Mengele's case. 
</P>
<P>
 "In November of 1956," the memo says, "he presented his birth certificate with 
his true name, certified by the Embassy of the Federal German Republic in our 
country, and requested the rectification of his name and surname." 
</P>
<P>
 Argentine authorities issued him a new identification card with his real name. 
</P>
<P>
 Another document shows that Mengele petitioned Goethe University in Frankfurt, 
Germany, to validate his medical degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Mengele was known as the "Angel of Death" for his role in the extermination of 
thousands of Jews at the Auschwitz death camp, where he performed experiments 
on prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Other documents found by Project Testimony say Mengele practiced medicine 
here, reportedly specializing in illegal abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 One paper explains Argentina's refusal to arrest Mengele for extradition 
because "the crimes attributed to the subject are political in nature." 
</P>
<P>
 An order for his arrest was finally issued in 1961, but he was never found. 
</P>
<P>
 Mengele later lived under another name in neighboring Brazil, where he drowned 
at an Atlantic resort in 1979, according to Brazilian authorities and 
international investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Nazi war criminal who came to Argentina was Josef Schwammberger, an SS 
sergeant who participated in thousands of killings as the commander of Jewish 
slave labor camps in southeastern Poland during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 An Argentine police document says Schwammberger entered the country in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 The only Nazi war criminal ever extradited from Argentina, Schwammberger was 
convicted in Germany and sentenced to life in prison in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In several notable cases, Argentine authorities have refused to extradite Nazi 
war criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1947, the Communist government of Yugoslavia requested the extradition of 
Ante Pavelic, a former Croatian leader and Nazi collaborator, for war crimes. A 
previously secret Argentine Foreign Ministry document recommended refusal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'war crime' is what we could call a recent juridical creation . . . akin 
to that of political crime," the document says. "Argentine legislation only 
contemplates extradition for common crimes, and it prohibits it for political 
crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 A June, 1947, letter from the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires asked Argentina not 
to admit Milan Stoyadinovich, a pro-Nazi former premier of Yugoslavia. On Sept. 
22, a man named Branko Benzon asked Director of Migration Pablo Diana to allow 
Stoyadinovich and his family to enter Argentina. The next day, Diana authorized 
the entry. 
</P>
<P>
 Beatriz Gurevich, coordinator of Project Testimony, said Yugoslav-born Benzon 
was a member of a secret commission that advised Diana's office on entrance 
permits for refugees from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Gurevich, the commission's members were natives of European 
countries and frequently made recommendations in favor of Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Project Testimony is preparing to release a document that shows how 
the commission played a key role in influencing immigration policy on behalf of 
fleeing Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
 Admiration for Germany was widespread in South American countries during the 
1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 President Juan Peron, who governed Argentina with an authoritarian hand from 
1946 to 1955, has been accused of neo-Nazi tendencies -- an accusation that is 
heatedly denied by Peronists. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews, Gurevich emphasized that Argentina was not the only Nazi haven, 
and not all Argentine officials were pro-Nazi. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be mistaken to think that in Argentina there was a generalized 
anti-Jewish and pro-Nazi attitude, because it wasn't so," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some documents uncovered by Project Testimony have shown that some Argentine 
diplomats in Europe helped protect Jews from persecution before and during the 
war. Others, however, denied visas to Jews and helped Nazis after the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentine diplomats in China sold visas to Jews and Nazis alike for up to 
$2,500, according to researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Foreign Ministry files, researchers have discovered a 1946 note from 
the U.S. Embassy that speaks of large-scale efforts to sneak Nazis into 
Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 "There exists a concerted plan to arrange the clandestine departure from Spain 
and entry into Argentina of former German agents," the note says. "It appears 
that it is becoming increasingly difficult for such German agents in Spain to 
remain concealed and that, as a consequence, some 150 to 200 Germans expect to 
come to Argentina under false identification." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1948, U.S. authorities asked Argentina to look for Hitler deputy Martin 
Bormann, who disappeared at the end of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 A note from the U.S. Embassy reported that "a source abroad" said Bormann was 
"allegedly residing in Posadas, Provincia de Misiones," in northern Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 An Argentine translation made the location "Posadas, Province of Mendoza," 
which is in western Argentina. If a search was ever conducted, it may have been 
in the wrong province, although Project Testimony has found no further 
documentation on the case or any other indication that Bormann may have entered 
Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 Project Testimony is being carried out by a handful of researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gurevich keeps copies of some key documents in her office but often is unable 
to locate requested papers. 
</P>
<P>
 If the information were computerized, she said, it would be easier to access. 
But just one researcher is assigned to the laborious work of entering all the 
data into computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Research in the government archives is laborious. Uncounted boxes of 
documents, often in disorder and without indexes, remain to be studied. 
</P>
<P>
 Gurevich said many documents will never be found because they have been thrown 
away or purged. 
</P>
<P>
 Information on Nazi arch-criminal Eichmann, she said, "is almost all purged." 
</P>
<P>
 The government says the Eichmann files were lost. Eichmann, mastermind of 
Hitler's genocidal policy against Jews, was abducted from Argentina by Israeli 
agents in 1960, tried in Israel and hanged. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the archives have yielded no information on Priebke, the former Nazi 
now being held in southern Argentina at Italy's request. 
</P>
<P>
 Gurevich said she had no knowledge of most other Nazis said to still be living 
in Argentina. Her project's purposes are historical, she said, with no priority 
on tracking down or gathering evidence against living war criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, said in 
a telephone interview that Argentina should be commended for finally opening 
its archives to such research. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the material is "on people who are no longer alive," Hier said. 
"The main issue is, who have they got out there like Priebke who are still 
alive?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Wiesenthal Center has proposed that Argentina form a special task force to 
look for Nazi war criminals in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 President Carlos Saul Menem recently said he believed that such an 
investigative group would be a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Menem has also said Priebke would be extradited "immediately, if all the 
documents are in order." 
</P>
<P>
 But Leonidas Moldes, the judge now in charge of the Priebke case, ruled in 
1988 against the extradition of Abraham Kipp, a former SS policeman from the 
Netherlands who has lived in Argentina since 1949 and has been convicted in 
absentia of war crimes by a Dutch court. 
</P>
<P>
 Priebke has admitted that he was the second-in-command of troops that executed 
335 Italians, including about 75 Jews, at the Ardeatine Caves south of Rome. 
But he told Argentine reporters recently that all the victims were Communist 
terrorists and were killed in reprisal for an attack that killed 33 Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lake and ski resort of Bariloche, 1,000 miles south of Buenos Aires, 
Priebke was prominent as the president of the local German-Argentine Cultural 
Assn., which sponsors a private school. Argentine newspapers have reported 
suspicions that the association served as a front for groups helping Nazi war 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 In late May, after Priebke's house arrest, the Italian Embassy asked Argentine 
authorities to take special security measures to prevent the ex-Nazi from 
escaping with the help of "organized groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Priebke, 81, is reported to be deeply depressed and in poor health, with high 
blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat. It remains to be seen whether he 
will live to become the second accused Nazi war criminal to be extradited from 
Argentina.

VIRGINIA GOP PICKS NORTH AS SENATE NOMINEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oliver L. North, the ramrod Marine who emerged from the Iran-Contra scandal as 
a conservative icon, won the Virginia Republican Senate nomination Saturday. 
His victory virtually ensured an unpredictable four-way contest for the seat 
now held by embattled Democrat Charles S. Robb. 
</P>
<P>
 At a tense and emotional party convention here, North comfortably defeated 
fellow conservative James C. Miller III, who had centered his campaign on the 
argument that North could not win in the general election. North carried 55% of 
the delegates' votes, to 45% for Miller, the former director of the Office of 
Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bring on the liberal elites: (President) Clinton, Congress, (Ted) Koppel and 
above all Chuck (Robb)," North declared exuberantly in a speech just before the 
vote. "It's time to take a stand: Whose side are you on?" 
</P>
<P>
 In selecting North -- an intense, charismatic former lieutenant colonel who 
drew both renown and disdain for his combative 1987 testimony to a 
congressional committee investigating the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages scandal 
-- the state party ensured a public split with its top-ranking federal 
official. Republican Sen. John W. Warner has condemned North as unfit to serve 
in the Senate and said he will back an independent candidacy by Republican J. 
Marshall Coleman, a former state attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Coleman has not declared his candidacy, he seems certain to run now 
that North has been nominated. North's victory also makes virtually certain a 
second independent candidacy from former Democratic Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, who 
contends his archrival, Robb, is so politically weakened that he cannot retain 
the Senate seat for the Democrats in November. 
</P>
<P>
 At the convention, North's strength was greatest in the southern part of the 
state. He ran particularly well among rural voters and evangelical Christians, 
who responded enthusiastically to his Reaganesque appeals to family values and 
populist attacks on Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 In a pre-vote speech barely 10 minutes long, North never diverged from those 
themes. As if squeezing rounds from a rifle, he blasted away at the "imperial 
Congress" with its "precious parking places and gilded goodies," the "bloated 
bureaucracy," the "Washington crowd," the "professional politicians" and the 
"ranting and raving powerbrokers." 
</P>
<P>
 His brief references to policy centered on the conservative agenda for 
restraining government -- the balanced budget amendment, the line-item veto and 
term limits -- as well as opposition to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 In remarks after the vote, North reprised those arguments in even more barbed 
tones: "Virginians are sick and tired of a Congress run by back-slapping good 
ol' boys -- and a White House governed by a bunch of 20-something kids with an 
earring and an ax to grind." 
</P>
<P>
 North, a former National Security Council aide, has acknowledged misleading 
Congress during the Iran-Contra affair, in which the Reagan Administration 
traded arms to Iran for the release of U.S. hostages in Beirut and used part of 
the proceeds to finance the Nicaraguan Contras. 
</P>
<P>
 In proceedings brought by special prosecutor Lawrence E. Walsh, North was 
convicted of obstructing Congress, shredding government documents and accepting 
an illegal gift of a home security system. 
</P>
<P>
 But his convictions were overturned in 1990 by a federal appeals court, which 
ruled that North's trial was tainted by testimony he gave to Congress while 
under a guarantee of immunity from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath, North quickly built a national following in conservative 
circles through speeches and extensive direct mail appeals for a foundation and 
political action committee he established. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Miller and North differed little on issues, the race polarized their 
supporters. At receptions, in hallways, waiting on line for credentials, the 
nearly 15,000 delegates here regularly combusted into spontaneous debates that 
inevitably turned on the same questions: Could North win a general election? 
Would Miller send to Washington the same stick-in-the-eye message as North? 
</P>
<P>
 Outside a party banquet Friday night, Robert Dunn, an engineer from the 
Richmond suburbs, was explaining why he supported North when Mark Roseneker, a 
Miller supporter from northern Virginia, challenged him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why gamble for ideology when you can win the election," Roseneker asked Dunn. 
"We are talking about a candidate (North) who reflects poorly on the Republican 
Party." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn replied: "I believe Oliver North can articulate the issues better, 
motivate the people better, give them a better direction. I believe we need 
somebody who can really send a message very clearly -- not muddled like it has 
been for so long." 
</P>
<P>
 As that exchange suggested, the race was less a choice between Miller and 
North than a referendum on North himself. To his supporters, North stands as 
"an American hero," as William Luchsinger, a Vietnam War veteran and delegate 
from Arlington put it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had to go to war again, I'd want an Oliver North in front of me and an 
Oliver North behind me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But even in this ardently Republican, overwhelmingly conservative audience, 
there were many who viewed North as untrustworthy and undependable -- a 
sentiment encapsulated in a button worn by Miller supporters: "Ollie, thou 
shalt not lie." 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks leading up to the vote, North had endured a steady barrage of 
criticism from fellow conservatives and former colleagues, ranging from Reagan 
to former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin L. Powell, who had raised 
questions about the former Marine's character and veracity. 
</P>
<P>
 In remarks after the vote Saturday, Miller urged Republicans to unite behind 
North. But party leaders are concerned about defections from Miller supporters 
like Susan Miller (no relation) of Bedford, who slapped down a North flyer 
moments after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot support a man that Colin Powell can't support and Gen. (H. Norman) 
Schwarzkopf can't support," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats will select their nominee in a June 14 primary. Robb, who has 
been battered by allegations of marital infidelity, faces conservative state 
Sen. Virgil H. Goode Jr.; Richmond lawyer Sylvia Clute, and Nancy Spannaus, a 
supporter of political extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls have shown Robb with a substantial lead, but Goode has been pounding 
Robb with mailings and television advertisements citing memos from the 
senator's own staff detailing allegations that he had committed adultery; 
Goode's television ads accuse Robb of associating with "prostitutes and drug 
criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 "If it were head to head, there's a decent shot Robb could lose it," said 
Democratic pollster Alan Secrest, who is not affiliated with any candidate. 
"But I don't see how it will happen with two opponents . . . splitting the 
vote." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the field will also fill in by then: Wilder and Coleman have until 
7 p.m. on June 14, when the polls close in the Democratic primary, to file the 
relatively modest 15,000 signatures needed to launch an independent campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after North's nomination, a committee to draft Coleman announced 
that it had collected enough signatures to place him on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 If the four-way race materializes, Virginia voters will face a choice with 
more angles than Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping track of the grudges alone is a formidable task. Robb and Wilder have 
a longstanding feud; Coleman lost the 1981 gubernatorial race to Robb, and a 
second round to Wilder in 1989. The religious conservatives fervent for North 
still bristle at Coleman for abandoning his opposition to abortion in the 1989 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 The political calculations are equally intricate. Paradoxically, the 
proliferation of candidates may help all of the contenders -- each of whom, for 
different reasons, would likely have difficulty attracting an absolute majority 
of votes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a race with four candidates, though, the winner may need only about 40% of 
the vote -- a prospect that helps the candidate with the strongest base of 
committed supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 North has such a base among evangelical Christians and other ideological 
conservatives. Wilder's base is among African Americans, who constitute between 
15% to 20% of the statewide vote in a general election. Robb has already won 
endorsements from the institutional ligaments of the Democratic Party -- 
organized labor, the teachers union, and abortion-rights groups. To the extent 
Coleman can match such assets, it will be through what is expected to be the 
vigorous support of Warner, who remains popular in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 At the convention, the state party passed a resolution urging Warner to 
reconsider his decision to oppose North's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 No public polls have yet tested support in a four-way race, but an adviser to 
one of the candidates said he believed that each would begin such a contest 
with backing from between 20% and 30% of the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 In Republican circles, the initial estimation is that the race would come down 
to North and Wilder, with Robb and Coleman fading. 
</P>
<P>
 But at this point all predictions are a stab in the dark. "This is the most 
complicated race I've ever come across," said Larry J. Sabato, a political 
scientist at the University of Virginia.

FARRAKHAN REPLIES TO CRITICISM; MUSLIMS: NATION OF ISLAM LEADER DECRIES RACISM 
IN LAS VEGAS SPEECH. HE AVOIDS DIRECT REFERENCES TO FORMER SPOKESMAN WHO WAS 
WOUNDED IN AMBUSH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sounding like a conservative politician and preacher, Nation of Islam leader 
Louis Farrakhan spoke reproachfully Saturday night of a vain society "where 
greed, lust and an inordinate self-interest have taken over," and scolded 
blacks for not organizing and taking more economic control of their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in Las Vegas, the 61-year-old Muslim leader avoided much of the 
politically explosive language that in the past 10 years has made him a 
controversial figure and drawn the enmity of a broad spectrum of political and 
religious leaders. Instead, Farrakhan emphasized his theme of self-empowerment 
and self-discipline among blacks, urging them to organize economically and 
socially. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Polish organize, the Jews organize," he said in a speech before 6,000 at 
the Thomas & Mack Center at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. "What is wrong 
with you? . . . You have been here longer than any racial or ethnic group, and 
you have less to show for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Six days after his former spokesman was shot in Riverside, Farrakhan did not 
comment directly on the ambush, but said: "We live in such a dangerous hour. . 
. . To hurt people because you disagree with them is totally unacceptable in 
civilized society." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan spent much of his speech addressing the much-publicized criticism of 
him. "While talk of racism and anti-Semitism swirl around my head, I'm here to 
let you know that calling Farrakhan a racist and a bigot and an anti-Semite is 
not going to help you solve your problems," he said to sustained applause. "I 
deplore racism. I am saying it again: I deplore racism. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be a racist, to me, is to be one who promotes his or her race as superior 
to, or better than . . . any other race. . . . That's wickedness." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan spoke extemporaneously for several hours. In a thundering voice, he 
railed against depriving other human beings of their rights. "Although I want 
to see black people uplifted," he said, "I will never resort to evil to uplift 
black people at the expense of others." 
</P>
<P>
 He also described the notion of him being against white people as "silly." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have done nothing to keep white people from being successful. We have done 
nothing to keep Jewish people from being successful. We do not marshal our 
energy, time, money or talent to block any individual from achieving their 
talents," he said. "So do not use false labels to describe Louis Farrakhan." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan's remarks were dramatically different in tone from those by Khallid 
Abdul Muhammad, who spoke a week ago in Los Angeles. Muhammad, who had been 
suspended as a top aide and spokesman because of anti-Semitic and anti-white 
remarks during a speech in November, reiterated those sentiments last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan -- who had gotten in trouble in February for saying he basically 
agreed with Muhammad -- did not make any direct reference to the shooting of 
Muhammad in Riverside, allegedly by an ousted Nation of Islam member. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan suspended Muhammad, 46, as his senior aide after a speech in which 
Muhammad called Jews "the bloodsuckers" of the black community, criticized the 
Pope and urged the killing of South African whites. Muhammad was shot last week 
in the legs in an ambush in which four of his bodyguards and a bystander were 
also wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 James Edward Bess, 49, an ousted minister of the Nation of Islam, pleaded not 
guilty to charges of attempted murder and assault. Police believe he acted 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech Saturday, Farrakhan apologized to the audience for the stringent 
security requirements. Everyone in the arena was searched with hand-held metal 
detectors and frisked before being allowed to enter. 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful of his venue, Farrakhan also noted that "gambling is forbidden in the 
Koran," and called Las Vegas "a city founded in sin." 
</P>
<P>
 He said prepaid reservations at a hotel were canceled at the last minute, 
forcing him to make a last-ditch effort to find a room to stay so he could 
speak. Saying that his reservations were canceled because "they must have found 
out it was I who was coming," Farrakhan said: "Since I've been here, I have 
felt like Mary trying to find a place to give birth to her baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan's arrival did indeed spark some controversy. A proclamation signed 
by only two City Council members welcomed him to the city and urged him to 
promote unity. The proclamation earned a public denunciation from the Jewish 
Federation of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Thomas & Mack Center reported getting calls from people 
concerned about Farrakhan's speech. "The university condemns any message of 
hate or bigotry," said Ron Drake, the assistant director in charge of marketing 
for the arena, "but we must recognize 1st Amendment rights to free speech for 
anyone who books our arena." 
</P>
<P>
 The university is not sponsoring the speech. The Nation of Islam rented the 
arena for $20,000 plus expenses.

FAITHFUL THRONGS REMEMBER BENSON; MORMONS: THE LATE PRESIDENT-PROPHET IS 
PRAISED AS A SIMPLE PLOWBOY WHO ROSE TO LEAD THE CHURCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES RELIGION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a triumphant but somber funeral, the world's 8.8 million Mormons bade 
farewell Saturday to Ezra Taft Benson, the Idaho plowboy who rose to become the 
13th president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the man 
whom the faithful considered to be God's prophet on earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Held in the Mormon Tabernacle, just a few yards from the historic Mormon 
Temple with its heroic gilded statue of the angel Moroni blowing a trumpet atop 
a stylized Gothic steeple, the funeral drew an estimated 5,000 Mormons and 
others, and messages from President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, United 
Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Utah Gov. Michael O. Leavitt 
and other dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mormon Tabernacle Choir sang several of Benson's favorite hymns, including 
"Love at Home" and "An Angel From on High." 
</P>
<P>
 Benson, who served as secretary of agriculture in the Dwight D. Eisenhower 
Administration and became president-prophet of the Mormon Church in 1985, died 
May 30 of congestive heart failure at age 94. He had been incapacitated for the 
last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of people lined the highway between Salt Lake City and Whitney, 
Ida., as the funeral procession made the two-hour drive to Benson's birthplace. 
There, surrounded by the faithful, including his children, grandchildren and 
great-grandchildren, he was buried in a rural cemetery beside his late wife, 
Flora, who died in August, 1992. It was only the second time a 
president-prophet of the church had been laid to rest outside Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Los Angeles attorney Howard W. Hunter, the most senior member of the 
Council of the Twelve Apostles, is expected to succeed Benson within a matter 
of days, church officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter, 86, who spoke with a sometimes frail voice and required assistance to 
reach his chair and the podium, said Benson would be remembered for his love of 
the Book of Mormon. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter drew some appreciative laughter when he said that although Benson's 
passing was a time of sadness, "it thrills us to think of the joyful reunion 
President Benson is having with his beloved sweetheart, Flora, who has been 
waiting patiently -- or perhaps even a little impatiently -- for her husband of 
66 years to join her on the other side." 
</P>
<P>
 Mormons believe in life after death and that marriages are eternal. 
</P>
<P>
 Tributes to Benson were numerous. Clinton hailed Benson as "a spiritual man . 
. . and someone who believed the priestly idea that families come first." 
Thomas S. Monson, former second counselor to Benson, recalled Benson's work in 
Europe after World War II in bringing food and clothing to the hungry and 
homeless. He was hailed for his work with the Boy Scouts of America and for his 
ardent anti-communism. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon B. Hinckley, former first counselor to Benson, said he had no doubt 
that the sight of war-ravaged Europe and desperate people was responsible for 
Benson's anti-communism. Benson once offered outspoken support for the 
ultraconservative John Birch Society. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am confident that it was out of what he saw of the bitter fruit of 
dictatorship that he developed his strong feelings, almost hatred, for 
communism and socialism," Hinckley said. 
</P>
<P>
 During Benson's eight years as president, he emphasized the importance of 
missionary work and exhorted Mormons to read the church's sacred Scripture, the 
Book of Mormon, and pattern their lives after the prophets and Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson had been a force within the denomination since 1943, when he became an 
apostle, a high-ranking position in the church's all-male hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the recurring theme Saturday was that of a simple farm boy who rose to 
political greatness and spiritual heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plowboy who became God's prophet has gone home," Monson said.

ON CALIFORNIA: ONCE MORE, INTO THE MALAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is late Friday morning. The sun has vaulted high over the steep, wild hill 
that sits right outside my motel room window. There is a slight breeze off the 
ocean, and the sky is clear and blue. I have come here to play golf with an old 
friend, wrapping up a two-week vacation, and also to speak to Cal Poly 
journalism students at their year-end banquet. 
</P>
<P>
 The golf part is done. Birds had little to fear from my shots today, but I did 
leave many a ground squirrel rattled. It didn't matter. The golf course was set 
on the southern lip of Morro Bay, at the border of a subdivision. It presented 
a series of spectacular, unfettered views of the estuary, of a long, immaculate 
sandspit and, in the distance, of the graceful hulk of Morro Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just imagine how it looked," my friend said gloomily, "before all the 
houses." 
</P>
<P>
 He is a California native, and beset with a malady rampant in this state. It 
is essentially a vision problem. The eyes no longer see the beauty of what is, 
but instead focus on what was. From the eyes the pox will travel -- to the 
head, to the heart -- leaving its victims convinced that California is a lost 
cause, sunk, goners, dead. Whining is an early symptom. In the latter stages, 
though, the disease can drive the inflicted to Nevada, which, of course, is a 
lot like dying. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But that was this morning. Tonight the journalism students will want to know 
what I do. The more promising ones also will want to know why. These are 
questions I thought about often during my vacation. When I began writing this 
column nearly three years ago, an editor issued this simple command: Explain 
California to Californians. The more I travel the state, the more I wonder 
about the assignment's fundamental premise. 
</P>
<P>
 From my experience, the notion of California as a singular, cohesive place, 
with shared assets and obligations and difficulties and dreams, has become 
antique. There always have been yawning internal divisions between north and 
south over water and power, but these historic regional feuds appear to have 
been replaced by something worse: Indifference. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco doesn't care much about Sacramento, which doesn't care much 
about Fresno, which doesn't care at all about Bakersfield, which cares about 
Los Angeles only in terms of how long it will take before the big bad city 
comes hurtling over the Tehachapi and into Kern County. Every place I go -- 
from Mt. Shasta to San Ysidro -- people seem too absorbed in their own brand of 
bleakness to worry about anyone or anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 The one belief Californians do hold in common is that it all has gone to hell. 
Southlanders who pine for San Francisco might be interested to know San 
Franciscans pine for places like Seattle. Anywhere but here. Anywhere where 
it's like this place used to be -- or at least how we imagined it. In Fresno 
everyone wants to escape to the foothills or the coast. In the foothills and on 
the coast, no one is quite sure where to move next; they nervously scout for 
options as the refugees pour in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As I said, this is a vision problem, an inability to see beyond the most 
recent disaster, to regard change as anything other than loss. Californians are 
scared. They have lost faith. In another time, a Roosevelt or even a Reagan 
might have come along and, pushing off from the downbeat pack, turned the 
malaise around. Nothing to fear but fear itself. And there you go again. And 
all that. 
</P>
<P>
 Not this time, not this California. Instead, politicians from Pete Wilson and 
Kathleen Brown on down have fed the collective anxiety, promoting fear, playing 
it for votes. Business executives have gloom-and- doomed their way to tax 
breaks. The press, too, has enjoyed its long run with the tale of paradise 
lost. And like all untrue stories, the more it is told, the easier it becomes 
to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 And so back to the students' questions. Why do I do what I do? My answer 
tonight will be this: My answer will be that I cling to this crazy notion that, 
in ways that go beyond geography, there is still a California, and it is worth 
writing about. It is a place of great beauty and untouched promise, and it is 
nothing like the California of political commercials and Time magazine covers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I will concede maybe I'm the one who is blind. Maybe I am tricked by 
mirages, guilty for my own reasons of wanting to see something too much. 
Certainly, I've failed so far to open many eyes; the malaise runs free. Still, 
I suppose there is fulfillment enough in trying. And it beats the alternatives. 
Which are whining, and Nevada.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; WHAT YOU SEE MAY NOT BE QUITE WHAT YOU GET; IN THE BATTLE 
FOR THE GOVERNOR'S SEAT, MANY VOTERS WILL BASE THEIR DECISION ON SLICKLY 
PRODUCED TELEVISION ADS. ONE ANALYST CALLS THE IMAGE WARS 'THE BATTLE OF THE 
CARICATURES.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Depending on who you believe, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown is either "Mona 
Lisa" or "Mary Tyler Moore." Gov. Pete Wilson is a "sober critter, anesthetic 
in his intensity," while Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi is "Western -- a 
rugged individualist." 
</P>
<P>
 Televised campaign advertisements are the only contact many Californians have 
with their gubernatorial candidates. But what messages do these 30-second ads 
actually impart? The Times asked a political scientist, a scholar of popular 
culture and an ad executive to analyze the spots voters have seen in advance of 
Tuesday's primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Among their off-the-cuff conclusions: Republican physicist Ron Unz, who billed 
himself as the futurist candidate by showing viewers a computer microchip, did 
not succeed in communicating credibility; and Democratic state Sen. Tom 
Hayden's two 13-minute ads are, in some respects, not all that different from 
the traditional 30-second spots that he shuns. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it the image wars -- or, as UC San Diego ethnic studies professor George 
Lipsitz puts it, "the battle of the caricatures." Lipsitz, who studies 
graffiti, rap music and other forms of popular culture, said the campaign ads 
strive to make candidates familiar by linking them to romantic, inspiring or 
frightening images that are already embedded in voters' minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The entertainment functions of TV are taking over," Lipsitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Garamendi is 'Quantum Leap'-ing from the Peace Corps to jobs all around the 
state," Lipsitz said, referring to various images of Garamendi's past that are 
spliced together in the Democrat's early ads. "Wilson is doing an 'Inside 
Edition' expose of immigrants crossing the border -- complete with live tape. 
Unz looks like a (late-night) infomercial. Brown is a cross between 'Mary Tyler 
Moore' and 'Little House on the Prairie.' And Hayden is 'Frontline.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, voters will choose, often basing their decisions solely on slickly 
produced TV images. Whether Brown is bashing Wilson on the economy or Garamendi 
is blistering Brown on the death penalty, voters would do well to look past the 
obvious to seek out hidden messages, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 In her ads, Brown makes California look bleak. The Democrat's commercials are 
stocked with grim, black and white images: abandoned businesses, empty parking 
lots and unemployment lines. But Brown appears in color, as a bright, cheerful 
solution to dark problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson makes California look scary. A glowering mug shot of a serial rapist 
and footage of illegal immigrants running across the border are the backbones 
of his recent TV commercials. When the Republican incumbent faces the camera, 
he is somber, as if to say: Governing is tough, and nobody's tougher than I am. 
</P>
<P>
 Each analyst was struck by the differences among the candidates' personas. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge for Wilson, all the analysts agreed, is to evoke the powers of 
incumbency and paint himself as a leader in his ads while somehow avoiding 
being blamed for the problems that have occurred during his tenure. That is 
why, in one ad, Wilson sits behind an official-looking desk striking what 
Lipsitz called a "state of the union" pose. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants to look like the governor," said Lipsitz, adding that Wilson's ads 
reminded him of action-adventure films in which an outside menace is identified 
and vanquished. "Here are immigrants running across the border," he said, 
describing Wilson's immigration ad. "Wilson sends in the National Guard. End of 
story. 'Book him, Danno.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin Gilliam, an associate professor of political science at UCLA, said 
Wilson's advertising strategy could be summed up in two words: "Straight fear." 
Why else, Gilliam asked, would his crime ad combine the face of serial rapist 
Melvin A. Carter with an ominous-sounding musical track and a narrator that 
sounds like a tabloid TV announcer? Why else would the immigration ad begin 
with the pronouncement: "They keep coming"? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's 'them.' It's 'they.' It's not 'us,' " said Gilliam, who said that while 
the economy falters, "Wilson has to make the issue (the candidates') capability 
to deal with the tough social problems that everybody thinks make California a 
bad place to live. The message is: He's the guy that can control (things). . . 
. He's tough enough to do it and he's experienced enough to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 But is he too sour-faced to do it? That was the question that occurred to Los 
Angeles advertising executive Paul Keye, who has created ad campaigns for 
products (Maxwell House coffee, Lone Star beer) and politicians (among them, he 
says, Wilson, when he ran for mayor of San Diego more than 20 years ago). 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at Pete Wilson's earnest, beleaguered grimness -- he's a sober critter, 
anesthetic in his intensity. . . . He's gonna tell you how to make a watch, and 
you want to know what time it is," Keye said. At the other end of the spectrum, 
he said, is Brown: "This Mona Lisa smiling that little smile." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's smile is by far the most photogenic of any of the candidates, the 
analysts agreed. Whether she is signing important-looking documents, pointing 
at charts or, in a biographical ad, hugging one of her grandchildren, she 
always looks great on TV: youthful, caring, determined -- in a word, nice. 
</P>
<P>
 But nice -- or nice-looking -- is not enough. Brown's challenge in the ads has 
been to portray herself as unflinchingly competent, efficient and resourceful. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilliam agreed that Brown "has to prove she has the fiscal expertise on the 
one hand, but she doesn't want to be the stereotypical Hollywood cold corporate 
(female)." That is one of the reasons, he speculated, that Brown rarely speaks 
into the camera. For all her telegenic qualities, he said, her delivery can be 
wooden. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of talking, Brown has come out with several versions of what Keye 
called "the busy lady spot" -- ads that portray Brown in constant action 
against a backdrop of images of California's economic downturn. These ads, 
Gilliam said, have a single unifying theme: "California's in the toilet. These 
other yahoos at the helm are tearing their hair out, but I'm calmly righting 
the ship." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's biographical ad provides a counterbalance -- a warm portrait that 
traces the evolution of one of California's best known political families, 
involving viewers in what Lipsitz called a "made-for-TV-movie" version of the 
life of former Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown's youngest daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's Kathleen Brown. This week her kids are growing up. Now she's going to 
law school. And here she is -- her dad is watching her win her race for (the 
treasurer's) office," Lipsitz said, mimicking the ad's narrator. "Realizing her 
dream becomes part of the story. . . . And in a way, of course, your own dreams 
are being symbolically represented too. It's like: If she can make it, then 
California is a place of opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, too, tells a romantic California story. The Democrat's biographical 
ad notes that he passed up a chance at the NFL to join the Peace Corps. Another 
spot shows him -- in a plaid shirt, cowboy boots and work gloves -- toiling 
alongside other Californians, loading lumber as part of his campaign to work a 
job in each of the state's 58 counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looks virile. He understands the working man and he's done a hard day's 
work in his life -- which is something you don't ever feel about Wilson," 
Gilliam said. "He's saying, 'I'm the people's candidate. I didn't sit at 
Daddy's elbow.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts agreed that these spots, each of which included the slogan "Working 
for California," did a good job distinguishing Garamendi from Wilson's "very 
country club, very corporate" look. But Keye thought Garamendi's "cut, hew and 
haul" odyssey was trite and unconnected to real issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if he's running for the John Muir award . . . or for department 
of forestry," said Keye, who was more impressed by the candidate's most recent 
ad, in which he attacks Brown for her personal opposition to the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The death penalty ad more resembles Wilson's crime ad than it does Garamendi's 
earlier spots. Garamendi sits at a desk. His work clothes have been replaced 
with conventional business attire. And the message, illustrated at one point 
with a shot of a police car's flashing lights, is starkly simple: Garamendi is 
tough on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Sincerity was the hallmark of Hayden's two 13-minute ads. After viewing one, 
however, Lipsitz said that for all Hayden's carping about the flaws of the 
30-second format, his longer opus felt a bit like "20 30-second commercials 
strung together." 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants to be the elder statesman, the nonaligned non-politician," Lipsitz 
said. "But like 'Frontline,' his ad has a constituency that thinks it's getting 
more complexity and more detail, but doesn't notice how much like other media 
its story is." 
</P>
<P>
 Unz, a political neophyte who spent more than $1 million of his own money on 
his campaign, had a lot to accomplish in his ads. With his youth (he is 32), 
inexperience (he has never held political office) and total lack of name 
recognition, he needed to find a way to present himself as a credible 
alternative to Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 After viewing his TV ads, which feature Unz sitting on a rock and standing in 
front of his elementary school, the analysts thought that he did not succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilliam marveled at the blandness of some of Unz's campaign promises. " 'I'll 
fulfill my oath of office.' 'I'll always stand firm.' I love this guy," he 
said.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / 1ST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT; UNUSUAL CONTEST REFLECTS 
REGION'S ECLECTIC POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some things are constants up along California's North Coast. The fog rolls in 
by evening, for instance, and you can always find a fresh catch of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 But with politics, predictable patterns come crashing down. To wit: 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, the voters dumped their longtime Democratic congressman and 
replaced him with a strait-laced Republican ex-cop. Two years later, they made 
a U-turn again, bouncing the Republican in favor of 1960s peacenik Dan Hamburg 
-- a laid-back liberal who refuses to wear a tie on the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes election year 1994, and the drama has turned stranger still. Like 
aging quarterbacks fighting for the starting slot, the trio of past and present 
congressmen has been reunited in a three-way struggle, creating what may be 
California's most unpredictable and intriguing spring campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wild one, something I've never seen before," said Dick Rosengarten, 
who publishes a newsletter on California politics. "It's three little piggies 
playing a very odd game of musical chairs. . . . Who wins? I couldn't possibly 
guess." 
</P>
<P>
 There is, of course, some method to this madness. The volatility of the 
politics is anchored, to a great degree, in the peculiar dynamics of the region 
the men are vying to represent. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprawling from redwood country on the Oregon border 350 miles south to Solano 
County, the 1st Congressional District has an extraordinary mix of economies, 
including fisheries, timber, wineries, marijuana, and even the military. Some 
towns are dominated by ranchers with gun racks in their trucks; others host 
communes of vegetarian pot growers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got vineyard owners, loggers, unemployed fishermen, military types and 
Earth First! radicals all mixed together," said Eric Koenigshofer, a former 
Sonoma County supervisor. "It's a very difficult array of groups for any 
candidate to tie -- and hold -- together." 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers suggest the district is a liberal one. President Clinton won big 
here, and Democrats hold a solid 51%-to-34% edge in voter registration. 
</P>
<P>
 But acute divisions over one burning issue -- the standoff between loggers and 
forest preservationists -- defy predictions and scramble traditional party 
lines. Up here, a politician is either pro-tree or pro-log; there is no 
in-between. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in the 1st District loves redwood trees," says Doug Bosco, who was a 
congressman here in the 1980s and is attempting a comeback. "It's just that 
half the people love them vertical and half love them horizontal." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Hamburg -- solidly pro-vertical -- is the incumbent trying to balance 
these forces and hang on to the job he wrested from Republican Frank Riggs two 
years ago. On Tuesday, he faces Bosco in the Democratic primary. If he 
prevails, Hamburg will probably face a November rematch with Riggs, who has 
only token opposition within the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamburg, 45, is a onetime Mendocino County supervisor of modest means, whose 
background has a distinctly "flower child" flavor. An anti-war crusader while 
at Stanford University, he joined the back-to-the-land movement in the 1970s 
and settled near Ukiah, where he and like-minded refugees founded an 
alternative school. A decade later, he moved to China, running a cultural 
exchange program with his wife, Carrie. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a decidedly low-key style, Hamburg has quickly distinguished himself 
as a different kind of congressman. Before arriving in Washington he raised 
eyebrows by collecting unemployment benefits during a portion of his campaign 
-- prompting Riggs to dub him "Deadbeat Dan." 
</P>
<P>
 Once in Congress, he bucked tradition by refusing to wear a tie on the House 
floor (a flap he resolved by agreeing to don a bolo tie) and became known as 
the "Capitol Hill hunk" after making People magazine's 1993 list of the 50 most 
beautiful humans on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 March brought more headlines. After promising to tithe a portion of his salary 
to charity, Hamburg reneged, saying he had a second mortgage to pay and had not 
realized the definition of tithe is 10% of one's pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents mock him for that flip-flop, but mainly deride him as a "flake" and 
"counterculture congressman." Supporters, however, call him refreshing, and 
praise him as a person who is seemingly unafraid of political risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite society's "just say no" attitude toward drugs, for example, Hamburg 
favors the decriminalization of marijuana and an end to California's 
paramilitary-style war on weed. In a time of mounting public concern over 
crime, he opposes capital punishment and the state's "three strikes and you're 
out" law. 
</P>
<P>
 And although it contained money for bases in his district, Hamburg voted 
against the defense budget because "it's foolish to spend millions on new 
bombers" in a post-Cold War world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether you agree with his views or not," said Connie Stewart, a member of 
the Humboldt County Democratic Central Committee, "you've got to admire his 
guts." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamburg's biggest political gamble is his bill to ban logging in Humboldt's 
Headwaters Forest, and to limit cutting in a 69-square-mile buffer zone around 
it. The bill has made Hamburg an instant enemy of the powerful timber industry, 
prompting some Republicans in the business to re-register as Democrats so they 
can support Bosco in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dan Hamburg is a nice guy, but he puts trees before people," said Richard 
Hargreaves, a mill worker in Ft. Bragg. "How can I support somebody who 
supports laws that put people out of work?" 
</P>
<P>
 It is the timber issue, not surprisingly, that illuminates the most dramatic 
contrast between Hamburg and Bosco, who served four terms in Congress after his 
election in 1982. Calling the Headwaters bill a land grab that will further 
stress struggling timber families, Bosco accuses Hamburg of pushing an "Earth 
First! environmental agenda" that will go nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dan can go to tears over a marbled murrelet," Bosco said, referring to a 
threatened bird that nests in dense redwood groves. "I'm more concerned about 
the kid whose world falls apart because Dad got laid off." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from his political motives, Bosco, 48, has a personal stake in the 
matter. A millionaire attorney, his clients include the owner of the Headwaters 
Forest, Pacific Lumber Co., which has paid him about $15,000 a month since 
mid-1993 to lobby against Hamburg's bill. Bosco's father-in-law owns a Eureka 
wood products company. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosco, who lives in Sebastopol, defines the primary contest as a cultural 
battle. Hamburg, he says, "is one of these laid-back '60s guys who is on the 
radical fringe on every issue. I'm reaching out to working-class, mainstream 
Democrats." 
</P>
<P>
 Walking precincts last week in Fairfield, home to Travis Air Force Base, he 
focused on drugs and crime -- never failing to mention Hamburg's opposite 
positions on marijuana and capital punishment. His campaign ads go further, 
invoking the abduction of 12-year-old Polly Klaas to point out that "Hamburg 
opposes the death penalty, even for murderers like Richard Allen Davis," 
Polly's alleged killer. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates differ stylistically as well. Bosco, who is married to a 
Municipal Court judge, wears crisp white shirts and Ralph Lauren ties and 
drives a late-model Mercury. Hamburg seems to prefer blue jeans for all 
occasions; his car is pushing 30 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Bosco is well-known in the House, his candidacy has angered members of 
California's Democratic congressional delegation, who unanimously endorsed 
Hamburg. Bosco, who also served in the state Assembly, says it is odd running 
as an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years I was one of the party stalwarts, the guy who threw the 
fund-raisers, who poured thousands into other Democrats' campaigns," he said. 
"Now I'm kind of like the guest crashing the banquet, spoiling the party. It's 
strange, but in one sense, it's sort of liberating."

GUNBOATS FIRE ON VESSEL FLEEING CUBA; REFUGEES: OFFICIALS SAY PASSENGERS MAY 
HAVE HIJACKED FREIGHTER FROM MARIEL. COAST GUARD INTERVENES AFTER 4-HOUR 
ATTACK, ESCORTS 59 TO U.S.

 Cuban gunboats fired for more than four hours Saturday on a Cuban freighter 
loaded with Florida-bound refugees who reportedly hijacked the vessel. Seven 
people were injured, one critically. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the wounded, including the ship's captain, were taken by Coast Guard 
helicopters to Key West Memorial Hospital. Three people who were hurt 
scrambling for cover during the shooting were treated on the ship, Coast Guard 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The freighter was hijacked by the people aboard, WTVJ-TV reported Saturday 
night, and a Coast Guard official said authorities believe a hijacking may have 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be something to that effect," Coast Guard Petty Officer Tim Keene 
said from Key West. "We're not sure at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers said three gunboats chased and tried to stop the 125-foot freighter 
Rene Bedia Morales soon after it left the Port of Mariel on Cuba's northern 
coast. They said the gunboats continued to fire even after passengers showed 
them that children were aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "They kept shooting at us, we showed them the children, they still kept 
shooting," Larisa Cuesta, a stepdaughter of one of the boat's officers, told 
radio station WCMQ in Miami. "At one point they threw ropes to try to drag us 
in. We cut the rope to get loose again." 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting continued for more than four hours, passengers said, moving from 
Cuban to international waters. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship's captain, who was shot in the neck, was in critical condition. One 
of the other three wounded was released from the hospital; the other two were 
in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Saturday, the Coast Guard brought 59 people ashore, Keene said. The U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service was processing them at the Coast Guard 
base before turning them over to the Cuban Transit Center in Key West, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A ham operator in Panama had received a Mayday call early Saturday when the 
ship was about 15 miles off the coast of Cuba. The operator relayed the call to 
the U.S. Coast Guard, which dispatched a Falcon jet, a cutter and two 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 The jet located the boat about 67 miles southwest of Key West in international 
waters. Passengers said the jet's appearance chased the gunboats away. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Ponce, a spokesman for the Cuban Interest Section in Washington, which 
represents the Cuban government, said Saturday that he had heard nothing about 
the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninoska Perez of the Cuban American National Foundation, a Miami-based exile 
group, said other refugees have been harassed at sea recently while trying to 
escape Cuba. "The Cuban government covers it up," she said.

EX-PROSECUTOR TO AID ROSTENKOWSKI IN CORRUPTION CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) on Saturday chose a former federal prosecutor 
to help him battle federal charges that he corruptly profited from his seat of 
power on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement in which he again proclaimed his innocence and vowed to mount 
"a vigorous and compelling defense," Rostenkowski said he had selected Chicago 
attorney Dan K. Webb to direct that effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb, who was U.S. attorney for the northern district of Illinois from 1981 to 
1985, will replace Washington defense lawyer Robert S. Bennett on the highly 
publicized and politically charged case. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett is said to have advised Rostenkowski to accept a plea bargain with 
federal prosecutors in which he would have pleaded guilty to a felony, resigned 
from Congress and served at least a limited prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rostenkowski, who temporarily stepped down as chairman of the House Ways 
and Means Committee after his indictment on 17 felony counts last week, made 
clear he had no intention of accepting such a deal. He said he had instructed 
Webb "to challenge the government's case at every turn." 
</P>
<P>
 Webb, chairman of the litigation committee of the Chicago law firm of Winston 
& Strawn, was once part of the special prosecutor team investigating the 
Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
 While serving as U.S. attorney, he prosecuted 10 Chicago police officers who 
were convicted of taking bribes to protect drug trafficking.

ROSTENKOWSKI'S BRUSH MAY PAINT CONGRESS; POLITICS: INDICTMENT OF WAYS AND MEANS 
CHIEF IS ANOTHER BLOW TO CAPITOL HILL'S IMAGE. ANALYSTS WARN AGAINST GOP USING 
IT AS A PARTISAN ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Rep. Dan Rostenkowski's trial on charges of fraud and embezzlement may be 
months away, but many of his fellow lawmakers, particularly Democrats, fear 
that the public has already found the entire Congress guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how it turns out for Rosty, we've all been indicted in the public's 
mind . . . and sentencing is set for Nov. 8," said a House leadership aide, 
referring to concern that Congress' latest scandal will fuel voter anger at 
incumbents seeking reelection this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution, 
said the Chicago Democrat's alleged misdeeds are far from typical of the way 
lawmakers behave. Despite that, he said, the allegations are likely to confirm 
the prejudices of disillusioned voters who think that the very word Congress 
has but two synonyms: pork and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 For worried Democrats, Rostenkowski's indictment earlier this week on 17 
felony counts also raises the specter of a high-profile trial that will refocus 
public attention -- just before congressional elections -- on the way they have 
run the institution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congress as a whole and the Democratic leadership in particular will in some 
ways be on trial with Rostenkowski, and that has a lot of people concerned 
about what will happen in November," said the House leadership aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Democratic strategists are still hoping that the political damage will be 
minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the House bank scandal two years ago, when many members were found to 
have abused the free overdraft privileges that went with their congressional 
checking accounts, the current allegations involve only Rostenkowski, who is 
accused of defrauding taxpayers of more than $500,000 through a series of 
illicit transactions that allegedly included kickbacks, misuse of government 
funds and fraudulent stamps-for-cash swaps at the House post office. 
</P>
<P>
 As for its repercussions in November, "this has nowhere near the importance or 
the dimensions of the House bank scandal, where you had widespread personal 
culpability," said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. Adding to the effect of 
that scandal, Mellman said, was the obvious guilt of incumbents who had 
overdrawn their checking accounts by tens of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The case against Rostenkowski remains unproved. But the allegations -- that he 
padded his payroll with ghost workers and that he obtained thousands of dollars 
worth of free stamps and illegally converted them into cash at the House post 
office -- are so juicy that Republican strategists hope to use them against all 
incumbent Democrats in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 While paying lip service to the notion that the deposed Ways and Means 
Committee chairman is innocent until proven guilty, the Republicans are already 
touting Rostenkowski's indictment as proof that corruption has been allowed to 
run rampant in a Democratic Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rosty deserves the right to plead innocent just like any other American, but, 
when it comes to enforcing ethics in Congress, the Democrats who have 
controlled the House for 40 years are guilty of criminal negligence," said Rep. 
Dick Armey of Texas, chairman of the House Republican Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rostenkowski is the most visible congressional Democrat, bar none, and as 
such this is a public relations disaster for House Democrats," said Rep. Bill 
Paxon of New York, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 A major theme in the next elections, said a senior aide of the committee, will 
be "reforming Congress," and Republicans plan to "run on that nationwide." 
</P>
<P>
 Partisan pit bulls such as Armey and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia 
are already on the attack, and GOP strategists figure that it will be easier 
this year for Republicans to portray themselves as outsiders because they no 
longer control the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts caution, however, that a strategy that relies too heavily on 
Congress-bashing and anti-incumbency could easily backfire on the Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you stir up anti-incumbency sentiments, it's very hard to steer them in 
a particular direction," said William Schneider, a political analyst at the 
American Enterprise Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "The risk for Republicans in raising the Rosty issue is that the public won't 
see it in partisan terms," and all incumbents will suffer, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Mellman agrees. In Washington, analysts tend to view everything through a 
prism of partisan politics, he said, but elsewhere, "most people draw the line 
not between Democrats and Republicans but between themselves and politicians. . 
. . To most voters, Newt Gingrich looks a lot like Danny Rostenkowski." 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans have some ethical baggage of their own. The ranking Republican 
on the House Appropriations Committee, Joseph M. McDade of Pennsylvania, has 
been under indictment on racketeering charges for two years. In the Senate, 
Republican Bob Packwood of Oregon is being investigated by the Ethics Committee 
on charges of sexual misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, even some Republicans are having misgivings about raising 
Rostenkowski's indictment as a campaign issue in the fall. "When one member of 
the institution is indicted, it casts a cloud over all the members," said Rep. 
John A. Boehner (R-Ohio). 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest liability for most members next November won't lie in having the 
letter D or the letter R after their names," added a senior Democratic House 
aide. "It will be the letter I -- as in 'I for incumbent.' "

 The father of Siamese twins separated last summer is back behind bars, facing 
an auto theft charge less than two months after his release from prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Lakeberg, 27, was being held without bond Saturday. He is accused of 
stealing a friend's car. Lakeberg spent six months in prison after skipping a 
parole hearing in October. 
</P>
<P>
 He also admitted buying cocaine with about $1,300 of the money donated for his 
daughters' medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Reitha, gave birth to conjoined twins on June 29, 1993. Amy and 
Angela Lakeberg were separated in August. Amy died and Angela remains in 
serious but stable condition.

CHINA ARRESTS 2 TO PREVENT PROTESTS OF 1989 CRACKDOWN

 Chinese authorities arrested a provincial labor organizer and a leading 
Shanghai dissident, part of an effort to ensure that Saturday's fifth 
anniversary of the Tian An Men Square crackdown passed quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhang Lin, 31, a pro-democracy organizer, was arrested in Beijing and sent to 
a detention center in his native Anhui province, his wife said by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhang, a member of a recently formed independent labor organization, has been 
on the run for two months. 
</P>
<P>
 The labor group models itself on Poland's Solidarity and claims to have 300 
members nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhang suggested that dissidents were going to try to stage symbolic 
commemorative acts to mark the June 3-4 Chinese army crackdown on demonstrators 
five years ago, in which hundreds, perhaps thousands, were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Public security directives were sent out weeks ago, and hundreds of police as 
well as office workers were mobilized to prevent even the smallest protest in 
Beijing's Tian An Men Square or the sensitive university district. 
</P>
<P>
 The hunger strike of Ding Zilin and Jiang Peikun, two People's University 
professors whose 17-year-old son was killed by Chinese soldiers, was the only 
known public protest on the anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhang's wife, Ji Xiao, said she received a police notice Thursday saying Zhang 
had been turned over to authorities in their hometown of Bengbu. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhang, a nuclear physics graduate from prestigious Qinghua University in 
Beijing, has been jailed five times. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, while thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators poured into 
Tian An Men Square, Zhang led local demonstrations and hunger strikes in 
Bengbu, an industrial city of 700,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In Shanghai, dissident Bao Ge, one of the would-be founders of a human rights 
group, was arrested late Friday night, according to news agency reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Bao, a Christian, had planned to visit a Shanghai church today to pray for 
those killed in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hong Kong, thousands of people defied Chinese warnings Saturday not to 
meddle in mainland politics, staging a candlelight protest to remember the Tian 
An Men Square demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters, including exiled Chinese labor activist Han Dongfan, poured into a 
park to mark the anniversary in a demonstration that organizers admit may 
become a thing of the past when Hong Kong returns to China in 1997.

 Three Hezbollah guerrillas were killed in clashes with Israel's surrogate army 
in southern Lebanon, keeping tensions high Saturday in the wake of an Israeli 
air raid on a training camp used by the militant Islamic group. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were no reports of new rocket attacks on northern Israel after two 
days of such strikes in retaliation for Thursday's air raid, which killed as 
many as 50 people. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest confrontation, three Hezbollah guerrillas were killed as they 
tried to mount a raid Friday night in the Rihan Mountain region of the 
Israeli-occupied "security zone" in southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 Security sources said the South Lebanon Army, Israel's surrogate militia, 
detected the infiltrators and fired shells from tanks, killing the three men. 
</P>
<P>
 Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is fighting to force Israel out of its 
self-declared security zone in Lebanon.

5 IRAQIS, 1 KUWAITI SENTENCED TO DEATH FOR PLOT TO KILL BUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five Iraqis and a Kuwaiti were sentenced to death Saturday for a foiled 
attempt to assassinate former President George Bush in April, 1993. Discovery 
of the plot led President Clinton to order a retaliatory missile attack on 
Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
 Six other Iraqis and a Kuwaiti were given prison terms ranging from six months 
to 12 years for their involvement in the plot, which was uncovered the day 
before Bush arrived to be honored for his leadership in liberating Kuwait from 
Iraq in the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 One defendant was acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Death sentences in Kuwait automatically go to an appeals court for review, a 
process that could take months. Capital punishment in Kuwait is carried out by 
hanging. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuwaiti security authorities discovered a car packed with 175 pounds of 
explosives a day before Bush arrived in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said the car was to be used to blow up the former President, who 
forged the U.S.-led coalition that drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait in 
February, 1991, nearly seven months after they invaded the Gulf emirate. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors charged that most of the defendants were Iraqi intelligence agents 
sent by Saddam Hussein's regime to kill Bush. Iraq denied masterminding the 
plot and vowed revenge against Kuwait for accusing it of such treachery. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq said Bush was "not worth several kilograms of explosives." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Salah Fahad, the court president, called the defendants "a bunch of evil 
men sent by Iraq to wreak havoc." 
</P>
<P>
 "As if what Iraqi intelligence did to Kuwait during the occupation was not 
enough, they have sent us this gang with their Kuwaiti partner to continue 
their shameful deeds inside Kuwait and terrorize the Kuwaiti people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants listened in silence as the judge delivered the sentences. When 
he finished, one of the Iraqi defendants, Raad Asadi, leaped to his feet and 
shouted: "There is no justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Pandemonium erupted in the heavily guarded courtroom when Jabbar Kanaani, a 
56-year-old Iraqi defendant, punched Asadi in the face. Asadi was the purported 
ringleader. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one of the 14 defendants, 36-year-old Wali Gazali, pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 He told the three-judge panel that Iraqi agents gave him a car packed with 
explosives and ordered him to blow it up at Kuwait University, where it was 
believed Bush was to be honored during his April 14-16 visit.

INDONESIAN QUAKE TOLL RISES TO 218 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of aftershocks, including two strong earthquakes, hit Indonesia's 
Java and Bali islands Saturday as the death toll from high ocean waves 
triggered by a quake the previous day climbed to 218. 
</P>
<P>
 No immediate reports of casualties or damage from the latest tremors were 
available, meteorological officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Saturday's strong aftershocks registered a preliminary magnitude of 
6.0, meteorological official Abdul Gafur said. A second measured 4.8, and more 
than 400 smaller aftershocks also hit the region, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's pre-dawn quake had a surface-wave magnitude of 7.2, according to the 
U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo. Surface-wave magnitude is based on an 
analysis of seismic waves that travel along the Earth's surface. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake did not cause major damage itself, but it created 20-foot-high waves 
that crashed into sleeping coastal villages on Indonesia's main island of Java. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the victims were fish vendors in the coastal district of Pesanggrahan 
in Banyuwangi.

GERMAN VETERANS HONOR THEIR WAR DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Uninvited to D-day ceremonies, German veterans remembered fallen comrades 
Saturday at Normandy's largest cemetery, where some of their former enemies 
joined them in sometimes tearful reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a cold, blowing rain, a French military band played the French and German 
national anthems as soldiers of both countries stood at attention, encircled by 
the graves of more than 21,000 German soldiers. Four former members of the 
French Resistance held their groups' flags before a monument to an unknown 
soldier, where children laid wreaths. 
</P>
<P>
 In French and German, officials from both countries spoke of the losses as 
well as of the new Europe that rose from the ashes of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their graves provide witness to the horrors of war and remind us living of 
the memory of the death, suffering and misery of millions of human beings," 
said Capt. Guenther Porrio, Germany's naval attache in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Franco-German reconciliation "is of decisive importance to the 
evolution and future of our continent," he told the crowd of about 300. 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles from Omaha Beach, a low, granite entrance leads into the cemetery 
containing 21,222 graves of German soldiers, each marked with a small, flat 
stone. 
</P>
<P>
 The main American cemetery nearby has about 9,300 graves. Most U.S. war dead 
were repatriated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God it's over, that the horrible battle can't happen again," said a 
tearful Helmut Mechemer, who was 20 when he was near Pointe-du-Hoc, a rocky 
German stronghold assaulted by the Americans. This time he came with American 
vets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We met in 1984 in Sainte-Mere-Eglise, and we've been friends since then," 
said Warren Lloyd, 73, of Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fought for our Deutschland," said Guenther Koehler, 68, who was a 
teen-ager on D-day. "We were 180 soldiers on June 6, and at the end of the day 
we were three." 
</P>
<P>
 Many cities in France have German twin cities, though hatred lingers, 
especially among elderly French. Plaques in some towns marking Nazi killings 
still refer insultingly to Germans. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first feeling is that it is very logical that the French didn't invite the 
Germans," said Franz Meyer, in charge of German cemeteries in Normandy and 
Brittany. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, the Germans could be invited later -- perhaps for the 50th 
anniversary of Germany's surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 There were emotional ceremonies as well in Norman villages and towns as 
thousands of veterans, many hosted by grateful French families in their homes, 
returned to the scene of their battles on what the local press has dubbed "The 
Longest Weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 At one such ceremony, 40 veterans of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division, led by 
Gen. Albert Smith, 75, who landed at Omaha Beach amid carnage early on June 6, 
1944, prayed together at the cemetery at Colleville-sur-Mer, overlooking the 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 3,000 Americans died fighting for that strip of sand fringed by cliffs. 
In a eulogy, Smith recalled the unit's motto: "No mission too difficult, no 
sacrifice too great. Duty first." 
</P>
<P>
 The veterans were saluted by 21 guns and an honor guard from the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization's military headquarters in Mons, Belgium.

DISPUTE OVER MUSLIM ENCLAVE DELAYS TALKS ON BOSNIA TRUCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnia cease-fire talks were postponed Saturday for at least another day after 
the government refused to accept U.N. assurances that Serbian forces had left 
the Muslim enclave of Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi had called the talks for Saturday afternoon, 
after they had been delayed for two days by the dispute, but he had to postpone 
them yet again when the Muslim-led government insisted on confirming the 
pullout for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi's spokesman, Michael Williams, said Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic 
agreed to attend truce talks today if his army commanders back up the U.N. 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 A Bosnian government liaison officer in Sarajevo said earlier that the Serbs 
had not completed their withdrawal from Gorazde, which has been under Serbian 
siege for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 This contradicted a report from U.N. officials in the town that no more armed 
Serbs were left, prompting Akashi to call the talks on a four-month Bosnia-wide 
truce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Serb forces have not withdrawn from the three-kilometer (approximately 
two-mile) exclusion zone around Gorazde," said Malik Skaljic, a liaison officer 
in Sarajevo between the Bosnian government and the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations imposed an exclusion zone around Gorazde to halt a Serbian 
onslaught on the town last month, but the Serbs left behind 150 soldiers who 
they said were acting as policemen to look after Serbian refugees in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbs and Muslims did attend parallel political talks Saturday focusing on how 
to divide the country between a Croatian-Muslim federation and the Serbs, who 
control 70% of its territory. But those talks appeared to be struggling.

 Gyula Horn, Hungary's last Communist foreign minister, was chosen on Saturday 
by his winning Socialist Party to be the new prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn and his government must be confirmed by Parliament. But his Socialists, a 
reform wing of the former Communists, won a majority in last month's elections, 
virtually ensuring that he will be the new head of government. 
</P>
<P>
 The 62-year-old Horn has vowed to continue Hungary's transition to a market 
economy, and on Saturday he reiterated his desire to have a coalition

said Elizabeth Clare Prophet, leader of the Church Universal and Triumphant. 
The church agreed not to store weapons on its property, which includes a large

CLINTON SAYS U.S. ECONOMY BACK ON TRACK, CREATING MANY NEW JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton sounded like he was running for reelection Saturday when he 
told Americans in his weekly radio address that the U.S. economy was expanding 
and creating lots of new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1993 I took office determined to renew our economy so that we could pass 
on prosperity and opportunity to our own children," Clinton said, speaking from 
Britain, where he was attending D-day anniversary ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, now we're beginning to see the result. Our economy is back. It's 
expanding steadily. Most important, it's creating jobs -- millions of 
good-paying jobs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said if the nation sticks to his economic plan, the federal budget 
deficit in 1995 will decline for the third year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added that "now we have an obligation to keep going. Too many Americans 
haven't yet been touched by the economic renewal." 
</P>
<P>
 The President said a good start would be to increase exports, noting that 
"trade means jobs." He promised to introduce a world trade agreement to 
Congress in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican opponents did not comment on Clinton's domestic statement, but 
instead chose to criticize the President's foreign policy in their radio 
address. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Steve Buyer (R-Ind.) said: "This Administration's wavering policies in 
Korea, Bosnia and Haiti have lacked clear and forthright leadership." He added: 
"There is a Biblical saying that when the trumpet is uncertain, who will 
follow?"

WHITE HOUSE REJECTS CLAIM CLINTON LED BY GREENSPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The White House moved quickly Saturday to reject a new book's characterization 
of President Clinton as following the lead of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan on economic matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert E. Rubin, chairman of Clinton's National Economic Council, said the 
President "relates to Alan Greenspan the same way he relates" to other policy 
experts, by hearing their views and then making his own decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no question about where the buck stops and who was making the 
decisions," Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House offered Rubin's comments to reporters after the Washington 
Post reported Saturday that a new book by Bob Woodward, assistant managing 
editor of the newspaper, depicts Greenspan as "a senior adviser, almost a 
teacher to Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 "In what became a pattern, the Fed chairman made suggestions, Clinton acted on 
them, and Greenspan rewarded the action with approving words," the Post said in 
a story based on the book. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Agenda: Inside the Clinton White House," goes on sale this month. 
</P>
<P>
 It says the early days of Clinton's presidency were marred by chaotic 
policy-making and a virtual war between his economic aides and four of his 
outside political advisers. It says Clinton pursued lower deficits at the 
expense of his campaign's economic populism on advice from Greenspan.

 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers, traveling with the President in 
Europe, dismissed the book as "all process." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the American people will judge President Clinton and his 
Administration on the basis of results," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Presidential counselor David Gergen, also traveling with the President, 
jokingly said of the book: "So what's new?" Gergen said similar material had 
been written before. 
</P>
<P>
 But White House officials clearly were uncomfortable with the suggestion that 
Greenspan was influencing Clinton and set up a conference call between Rubin 
and reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President is extremely well-grounded in these issues," Rubin said. "He 
came into office with a vision. . . . It's that strategy that we've been 
following." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin said that while there were differences of opinion among Clinton's aides, 
they worked together in a spirit of goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a story of a White House that has functioned extremely successfully with 
respect to these issues," he said. "A White House that is in chaos wouldn't 
have had that result."

 A widow said she hopes to start a family using sperm surgically removed from 
her late husband's corpse and then frozen.Manny Maresca was killed in a car 
crash May 19, just 16 days after he and Pam Maresca married. Within hours of 
his death, sperm was harvested from his body and frozen for future use. Pam 
Maresca, 22, said she hopes to bear a child using a procedure in which one of 
her eggs will be fertilized with the sperm in the laboratory and then implanted 
in her uterus. If a child results from the procedure, it will be a first, said 
Dr. Mark Jutras, the Orlando fertility specialist who harvested the sperm.

FBI AGENT ACCUSED IN EFFORTS TO SELL STOLEN HEROIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An FBI agent has been accused of stealing and then trying to sell 100 pounds 
of uncut, high-quality heroin from the agency's evidence room. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth R. Withers, 33, was arrested Friday at his office.The seven-year 
veteran special agent was being held in federal prison. A bail hearing was 
scheduled for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult for us to arrest one of our own agents," said Bob 
Reutter, special agent in charge of the bureau's Philadelphia office. 
</P>
<P>
 The bureau conducted a two-month investigation into a supplier named 
"Salvatore," who contacted dealers through the mail and offered to front them 
large quantities of heroin in return for money to be mailed to postal boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Withers, of Medford, N.J., turned out to be the supplier, and the drugs for 
sale were stolen from the bureau, authorities said. Withers asked dealers for 
$75,000 per kilogram, or 2.2 pounds, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts identified Withers' handwriting on application forms for the post 
office boxes and found his fingerprints on FBI documents relating to its 
investigation, the bureau said. 
</P>
<P>
 Withers took the heroin between January and March and replaced it with sodium 
bicarbonate, Reutter said. 
</P>
<P>
 His letters to dealers even contained one-ounce free samples of one batch 
seized from a Pakistani dealer, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reutter said some of the missing heroin was recovered from the basement of one 
of Withers' relatives in Kentucky, but he could not say how much had been sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Withers faces a mandatory 10-year prison term and a maximum life term if 
convicted of distributing and conspiring to distribute more than 1 kilogram of 
heroin.

PROTESTERS BLOCK ABORTION CLINIC IN DEFIANCE OF FEDERAL ACCESS LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Protesters chained and cemented themselves to cars blocking an abortion clinic 
Saturday and claimed to be the first to break a federal law against such 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislation signed by President Clinton on May 26 prohibits protesters from 
blocking access to women's health clinics or threatening patients and 
employees.The measure -- the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act -- has 
been dubbed "FACE." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is wrong for any law to penalize lifesaving action," said Monica 
Migliorino Miller, the protesters' spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Milwaukee pro-lifers are the first in the nation to break FACE for the sake 
of protecting the defenseless unborn," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least five protesters used concrete and chains to fasten themselves to two 
vehicles blocking the doors of the clinic. Firefighters freed them. Across the 
street, other protesters erected three-foot-high white crosses, sang hymns and 
prayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Paul Smallish said eight people were arrested on charges of 
disorderly conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI is investigating whether to file federal charges against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty to 25 demonstrators from several area anti-abortion groups gathered at 
the site. The clinic, Affiliated Medical Services, was closed for about 90 
minutes because of the protest.

DRUG LAB, BOMB RULED OUT AS S.F. BLAST CAUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investigators said Saturday that they have eliminated a drug lab or bomb as 
the cause of a building explosion that killed three men, and believe the blast 
was accidental. 
</P>
<P>
 Attention has shifted to a natural gas furnace or water heater within the 
three-story apartment building, said San Francisco Fire Chief Joe Medina.But he 
added that evidence is still sketchy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any kind of a gas leak from the street has been ruled out, an illegal drug 
lab has been ruled out," he said. "Right now we're still looking . . . but we 
haven't come up with a cause yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The blast Thursday night leveled the building, raining debris over the 
Tenderloin district neighborhood and shattering windows within half a block. 
Three bystanders were found dead in the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Logan, assistant chief of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms in San Francisco, said the explosion and fire were not set 
deliberately. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have found no evidence of an explosive device, no evidence of an 
incendiary device, or somebody pouring gasoline," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While ruling out a natural gas leak from the street or in the pipes within the 
building, authorities believe that gas may still have been the cause, Medina 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible that gas leaked out of the furnace or water heater, and built 
up until it ignited, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Logan said there was no evidence that the three victims had anything to do 
with the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco coroner's office Saturday released the names of the men and 
said they were all city residents. They were identified as Armando Gonzalez, 
Adalberto Flores-Diaz and Adolpho Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
 They were apparently standing or walking along the sidewalk beside the 
building when it erupted into flames and collapsed about 9:45 p.m.

ELECTIONS / 41ST ASSEMBLY DISTRICT; 6 DEMOCRATS DEFINE THEIR DIFFERENCES IN 
FINAL PUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six Democratic candidates in the 41st state Assembly District took their 
distinctive styles and messages to voters from Agoura Hills to Santa Monica 
this weekend in a final burst of campaigning in one of the city's most 
competitive -- and unpredictable -- races. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Republicans are also running for the post in the district, but it is 
widely believed the Democratic nominee will prevail in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The incumbent, Assemblyman Terry Friedman (D-Brentwood), set the stage for 
Tuesday's Democratic primary free-for-all by deciding to run for a judgeship, 
not for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic sextet has spent almost $1 million, combined, running for the 
Friedman seat, which represents some of Southern California's choicest real 
estate, including the western San Fernando Valley, the Conejo Valley, Malibu 
and the Westside of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate William Rothbard, 43, an attorney, planted a 1989 Orioles baseball 
cap on his head Saturday to begin another day of precinct-trekking in the San 
Fernando Valley. On this day, a West Hills neighborhood was the target of his 
voter pitch, refined by two months of campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 "You often have only seconds," he told a reporter, "so you've got to hit the 
high notes fast." 
</P>
<P>
 His high notes, as delivered to voters Allen Sokoler, a retired accountant, 
and his wife, Sonya, a piano teacher, were precise. First, as vice chairman of 
the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, he is trying to purchase properties 
near their home as parkland, including the Soka University site. Then, he told 
them that he's the candidate with the longest list of endorsements from law 
enforcement groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothbard's high notes seemed to appeal to the Sokolers' worries about creeping 
crime. "It just makes me sad to see all the people with bars on their windows," 
Sonya Sokoler said. "It makes it look like the good people are in cages." 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Sheila Kuehl, 53, best known as Zelda in the 1960s TV sitcom "The 
Many Loves of Dobie Gillis," briefed campaign workers in her Santa Monica home 
Saturday as they prepared to walk precincts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants to know about crime," Kuehl told Jim Fourat, a campaign 
worker whom she called a "wonderful progressive, and AIDS activist." Kuehl 
coached Fourat to tell voters that she is the only candidate with a real record 
of fighting violence as a women's activist who developed anti-spousal abuse 
programs. "What if they ask about capital punishment?" Fourat asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just feel uncomfortable with it," said Kuehl, a law professor. "It's like 
condoning violence -- it's inconsistent." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Later, walking a precinct near her Ocean Park home, Kuehl approached voter 
Camille Cuttaia, an occupational health nurse, who was changing the oil on her 
car. "I'm one of six people running -- there's five guys and me," Kuehl said by 
way of introducing herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuttaia looked up from under the hood. "If you're the only woman on the ballot 
-- then you've got my vote," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Tabash, 43, has been chased by dogs and even a horse in his pursuit of 
votes in the more rural areas of the 41st District. But last Friday, as the 
attorney trudged through a sunbaked neighborhood in Agoura Hills, his biggest 
enemy was the time of day. Precinct-walking in the early afternoon finds few 
people at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabash had picked this precinct and others to walk because its conservative 
Democrats are likely to be receptive to his get-tough stands on crime and 
illegal immigration. Polling data shows that voters here tend to be 
unsympathetic to state Sen. Tom Hayden, the liberal former anti-war activist 
who represents Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabash arrived on the doorstep of Norma Landy, an insurance company manager, 
as she was rushing to finish household chores. But she paused to listen and 
talk. "Of the six Democratic candidates, I'm the only one with a strong stand 
on illegal immigration," Tabash said. 
</P>
<P>
 Landy asked what the other candidates say on the issue. "They don't want to 
touch it," Tabash said. 
</P>
<P>
 The late-afternoon sun was ricocheting off the plate-glass windows of the Vons 
grocery store in Tarzana, parboiling everything nearby. But that didn't stop 
Roger Jon Diamond -- dressed in a UC Berkeley T-shirt, sweat pants and tennis 
shoes -- from trying to enlist shoppers in his latest political crusade. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were in the hills looking down in the Valley, you'd see this brown 
cloud," Diamond, 53, told two voters in a row as he talked about the need to 
clean up the air. The voters seem unfazed, their concerns elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Roger Diamond saying what he thinks," Diamond told a reporter. "I'm not 
abandoning my environmental concerns for political expediency. On the other 
hand, I'm obviously concerned about other issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond, an anti-smoking activist who for years also led two notable fights to 
block oil drilling along the coast, eschewed precinct walking. "I don't like to 
intrude on people in their homes," he said. But Diamond, an attorney, seemed to 
revel in practicing the art of connecting with voters in the hubbub of a 
shopping center. When one voter told him she was a Clinton supporter, Diamond 
pointed to one of his brochures and a photograph therein of him meeting the 
President. When another bristled about illegal immigrants, Diamond related how 
his daughter, a schoolteacher, found bilingual education to be inefficient. 
</P>
<P>
 And when shopper Leesa Hersch of Encino came along, Diamond joked: "If you 
vote for me, I'll even name a bill after you." 
</P>
<P>
 It had happened before and it happened again Friday for candidate Pat 
MacGuire, 43, when he knocked on the door of Marie and Rocco Soldato of West 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got your mother's letter and it made a big impression on me," Marie Soldato 
told MacGuire. "We felt the honesty in the letter, and that's what we want to 
see in our officials." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia MacGuire's letter praising her son's rectitude and willingness to 
reject campaign contributions from political action committees was one of the 
first pieces of political mail to go out in the 41st Assembly race. And it has 
proved a valuable voter icebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice on Friday afternoon, older women mentioned the letter and invited 
MacGuire in from the heat to have a cold drink. 
</P>
<P>
 MacGuire said his targets are stable homeowners who are worried about taxes 
and disenchanted with politics as usual. For these voters the candidate, a 
special-education teacher and financial consultant, has a platform: shifting 
the property tax burden from residential to commercial properties and donating 
a large share of his salary to local police agencies to help fight crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate John Shallman, 30, a business consultant, was riding high Saturday 
as he walked precincts in Woodland Hills, reminding voters that only days 
earlier a local newspaper endorsed him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am the Valley candidate," Shallman told voters on his precinct rounds, 
noting that he has lived in the San Fernando Valley since 1986. It is a 
residency record that no other candidate can match in an Assembly district 
where more than half the electorate lives in the Valley. Only Shallman and 
MacGuire reside there now. 
</P>
<P>
 Another of Shallman's high notes with voters was that he is the only Democrat 
in the race who supported Richard Riordan, the independent-minded Republican 
who won the Los Angeles city mayor's race last year against liberal Democrat 
Michael Woo. In fact, Shallman points out, he was assistant political director 
of Riordan's campaign. While acknowledging that his youthful looks sometimes 
make him look more a candidate for student body president than for state 
office, Shallman said he has the intellectual maturity to hold down the 
Assembly job. "I don't adhere to any rigid ideology, right or left," he told a 
reporter. "I'm not talking about slogans, but solutions."

FAUSTIAN DEALS, 'FACTORIES OF DEATH' IN WWII 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A few months after Japan surrendered in World War II, a funeral was held in a 
village outside Tokyo marking the death of a wealthy general who had supervised 
gruesome human experiments as part of the Japanese army's germ-warfare program. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lt. Gen. Shiro Ishii wasn't dead. The funeral -- complete with mourners, 
priests and burnt incense -- was a ruse aimed at throwing American war-crimes 
investigators off his trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Ishii eventually was found and provided American authorities with details of 
Japanese biological-warfare tests in Manchuria that killed large numbers of 
Chinese. In exchange, U.S. officials agreed not to prosecute him for crimes 
against humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 Wary of the political uproar that might have ensued if the deal became 
publicly known, the U.S. government covered it up for decades and even today 
continues to withhold information, according to a new book by retired Cal State 
Northridge history professor Sheldon H. Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Factories of Death: Japanese Biological Warfare 1932-45 and the American 
Cover Up," Harris writes that American officials struck their Faustian bargain 
with Ishii to avoid a public trial that would have revealed details of Japanese 
germ experiments to the Soviets as the Cold War dawned. 
</P>
<P>
 Although American scientists at first thought there was much to learn from the 
Japanese, they later concluded that the U.S. Army's biological-warfare program 
was far more advanced, according to Harris. The Japanese never produced a 
practical germ-warfare weapon of mass destruction, but U.S. forces were ready 
to manufacture enough bacteria bombs for large-scale attacks on Japan by the 
time the war ended, he writes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The data Ishii and the others furnished the United States with were -- at 
best -- of minor significance," he writes. "The cost to the United States in 
terms of honor and integrity appears to be high in comparison to the worth of 
the material" it received from Ishii and the remaining biological-warfare 
specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, U.S. officials have reluctantly confirmed giving Ishii 
immunity from war-crimes prosecution. But the Japanese government has never 
acknowledged that his dreaded Unit 731 carried out experiments on live humans 
in Harbin and other Chinese cities during the 1930s and 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An emeritus professor of American and film history at CSUN, Harris spent more 
than four years researching and writing his book. Peppering U.S. government 
agencies with requests under the Freedom of Information Act, he obtained more 
than 1,000 pages of documents -- many formerly classified -- on U.S. handling 
of Japanese germ-warfare specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 The book focuses on the brilliant but ruthless Ishii, a wealthy landowner's 
son who became a doctor before joining the army in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
 Possessed of a booming voice and almost superhuman energy, Ishii was a 
relentless womanizer who often went on all-night drinking binges and prowled 
local geisha houses after a hard day's work at an army hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1920s, he became convinced that biological weapons offered Japan a 
particularly cheap and effective battlefield weapon, and set out to convince 
his army superiors. In the prewar years, his efforts helped make Japan the 
world's leader in germ-warfare research. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1932, after Japan had brutally occupied Manchuria in northern China, Ishii, 
then a major, erected a biological-warfare station in the village of Beiyinhe, 
south of the bustling Manchurian metropolis of Harbin, according to Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 In later years, Ishii and his cohorts -- many of whom became prominent 
scientists, academics and businessmen after the war -- built several more 
germ-warfare facilities throughout Manchuria, turning the region "into one huge 
biological warfare laboratory," Harris writes. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the biggest was the Ping Fan complex, also south of Harbin. Its 76 
buildings included laboratories, dormitories for civilian workers, barns for 
test animals, greenhouses and a special prison for human test subjects. Built 
on six square kilometers, it employed 3,000 Japanese doctors, technicians and 
soldiers and rivaled Auschwitz in size. 
</P>
<P>
 For pure grisliness, Ishii's experiments were on a par with those of the 
infamous Nazi doctors, who performed horrific medical "tests" on Jews and other 
concentration-camp inmates, according to Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Ping Fan prisoners -- often Chinese guerrillas, criminals or ordinary citizens 
snatched off the streets of Harbin -- were injected with plague, typhus, 
smallpox, cholera and other deadly diseases. They died in slow, feverish agony, 
with Japanese scientists observing them closely to see what doses were needed 
to kill humans. 
</P>
<P>
 Prisoners were staked to the ground and exposed to germ bombs dropped from 
airplanes. Their heads were split with axes and their brains removed for 
"study." Some were dissected while still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 To gauge their reaction to frostbite, prisoners' limbs were repeatedly frozen 
and thawed, until their flesh rotted and bones protruded. After being 
autopsied, the dead were disposed of in crematories. 
</P>
<P>
 Worried that local Chinese would discover the compound's true purposes, the 
Japanese operated Ping Fan in strictest secrecy. Train passengers were required 
to draw their curtains as they passed. Pilots were told they would be shot down 
without warning if they strayed over the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The local population was told the vast death complex was actually a lumber 
mill. Among themselves, the Japanese mockingly referred to human test subjects 
as marutas , or logs. 
</P>
<P>
 While prisoners lived in terror, Ishii and his colleagues lived in relative 
luxury. They enjoyed swimming pools, a bar, gardens, a 1,000-seat auditorium, a 
Shinto temple, even a brothel. Ishii lived in a Harbin mansion, commuting to 
his death lab in a chauffeured limousine heavy with armor plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides killing captives at Ping Fan, the Japanese conducted "field tests" 
against both Chinese troops and civilian populations. Ishii and his operatives 
slipped into towns and villages, poisoning water wells and even fed chocolates 
laced with anthrax to local children, Harris writes. 
</P>
<P>
 Because many records were destroyed during and after the war, there is no 
reliable count of how many people died in Japanese germ-warfare operations. But 
Harris estimates that the total runs into the hundreds of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 Ishii and his underlings killed at least 12,000 prisoners at Ping Fan and 
other death factories, and probably far more, Harris writes. Tens of thousands 
more died in the field tests and in epidemics that erupted in Manchuria during 
and after the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris writes that Unit 731's victims included Han Chinese, White Russian 
exiles, Harbin Jews and Soviet prisoners of war. But he casts doubt on the 
persistent rumor that Ishii experimented on American POWs, saying no U.S. 
servicemen interned at the big Mukden prison camp reported such treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 But how could the well-educated scientists and technicians of Unit 731 conduct 
their nightmarish experiments and still sleep at night? How could they inure 
themselves to the monstrous cruelty and suffering they inflicted? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harris attributes their indifference to prewar Japan's chilling credo of 
racial superiority, fostered in large part by the fanatical militarists who 
then dominated Japanese life. 
</P>
<P>
 Ishii and others were able to freely kill human test subjects because "they 
knew their victims were inferior beings who were being sacrificed to a higher 
cause," writes Harris. "The superior Japanese race would benefit immeasurably 
from the sacrifices of people who were, in general, of little value to 
mankind." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Allies tried and executed 23 Nazi doctors, and the Soviets tried 
a dozen Unit 731 members they captured, U.S. authorities -- including Gen. 
Douglas MacArthur -- did not want Ishii or his collaborators prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 After he came out of hiding, Ishii played a clever game with U.S. authorities, 
receiving them at his home dressed in his best kimono, releasing tantalizing 
bits of information as he held out for a written guarantee that he would not be 
prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 He eventually received a pension from the Japanese government and died of 
cancer in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. was convinced that a war-crimes trial would expose volumes of 
precious data that could give the Soviets a leg up on biological warfare, just 
as the two former allies plunged into the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris says that ironically, the American biological-warfare program, begun 
only in 1943, was far superior to the Japanese. By 1945, the United States was 
preparing to produce 1 million small bombs laden with anthrax that could have 
been dropped on Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Why were American scientists so willing to gloss over Ishii's crimes for the 
sake of getting their hands on his data? 
</P>
<P>
 Harris suggests that they hungered to compare their information -- derived 
only from animal tests -- with the "forbidden fruit" of the Japanese data, the 
byproduct of human experimentation that was ethically off limits for American 
researchers.

STARRING ROLE FOR NOHO; BURGEONING ARTS DISTRICT SPOTLIGHTED IN FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL BETTNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeing the fledgling NoHo district come alive with events like this weekend's 
second annual Performing and Visual Arts Festival particularly warms the hearts 
of entertainment industry veterans like Ken Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just wonderful. I've lived in the Valley for 21 years now, so I've 
watched this area grow and really turn into something," said the 68-year-old 
character actor.  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson tends to turn up in zany movies, including "I Married an Ax Murderer" 
and "The End" with Burt Reynolds, "where I played a lunatic who did bird 
calls," he said. "But even though I've worked in films and television for a 
long time, before that I spent 25 years in the theater." 
</P>
<P>
 A North Hollywood resident, Johnson said he recently brought his brother, who 
is also an actor, to the NoHo arts district "to show off the neighborhood. He 
was very impressed." Several thousand people turned out for the opening day of 
the free festival Saturday. It continues today in the plaza of the Academy of 
Television Arts and Sciences at the corner of Magnolia and Lankershim 
boulevards from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The event showcases an eclectic variety of professional and amateur acts on a 
tent-covered stage, and also features vendors selling art, crafts and food. 
</P>
<P>
 But the festival's main purpose is to promote NoHo's burgeoning number of 
theaters. There are now 15 theaters in the neighborhood, eight of which are 
staging scenes from current shows as part of this weekend's festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 Festival-goers can see the productions by hopping on a free shuttle bus that 
makes the rounds every 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking them to all the theaters not only so they can see and appreciate 
live theater, but to see our theaters and to know we have a number of quality 
theaters in the NoHo district," said Jim Mahfet, executive director of the 
North Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, festival sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chamber of Commerce and other organizations, including the television 
academy and the Community Redevelopment Agency, have been working to clean up 
and promote the neighborhood as the NoHo arts district since 1980. They are now 
hoping Los Angeles city leaders will make it official -- giving a boost to the 
commercial revitalization of North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping the district will continue to grow and bring in more artists. 
They in turn will bring in more and more people to see the art," Mahfet said.  
</P>
<P>
 Another festival goal is to showcase promising new entertainers, said Susan 
Cheyno, another of the festival's organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the idea is to give new groups a start and hopefully help them on 
their way," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheyno pointed to Donna and Mark Foster of La Crescenta as a good example. 
</P>
<P>
 During the week, Donna, 38, teaches fifth grade at a Los Angeles elementary 
school and Mark, 38, works for a security company. On weekends, the couple play 
Renaissance and Celtic music using period instruments, as well as an electronic 
keyboard and other 1990s technology.  
</P>
<P>
 They have been playing at weddings, bookstores and charity gatherings for 
about eight years. But Saturday was one of their first opportunities to appear 
at such a large, well-publicized event. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a chance the couple eagerly grasped, despite temperatures that made for 
difficult work in heavy velvet and brocade costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people ask us how we cope with the heat," Donna said. "We say we 
drink a lot of water and just try to grin and bear it. But we both love music 
so we love doing this. 
</P>
<P>
 "And, of course, we've been working on a demo tape and CD. Make sure you 
mention that!" she said with a laugh.

SUSPECT IN ATTACKS ON WOMEN ARRESTED; CRIMES: POLICE SAY THE MAN'S TRUCK 
MATCHES THE DESCRIPTION OF VEHICLE USED IN A SERIES OF ASSAULTS. VICTIMS WERE 
ABDUCTED ALONG VENTURA BOULEVARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A man who police said may be responsible for stalking, abducting and raping as 
many as seven women as his victims walked along Ventura Boulevard during the 
past month has been arrested, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Howard August Davis, 29, was taken into custody at 7:30 p.m. 
Friday near Ventura Boulevard and Sale Avenue in Woodland Hills. Police said 
the man's truck -- a light-colored pickup -- matched the description of the 
vehicle used in a series of assaults that have plagued the area since the end 
of April. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Chief Martin Pomeroy, who commands Los Angeles Police Department 
operations in the San Fernando Valley, said authorities have not been able to 
identify a clear pattern in the Valley assaults and therefore are unsure if the 
suspect is responsible for all seven crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're fairly positive he's good for at least one crime and we believe he may 
be good for as many as six others," Pomeroy said Saturday. "It may prove to be 
a very significant arrest if we can tie in all these crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's even a single rape that this guy is charged with, it is still a 
significant arrest because rape is a terrible crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Pomeroy declined to elaborate on the details of the case. The investigation is 
being coordinated downtown by the Police Department's Robbery Homicide 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Ventura Boulevard merchants whose businesses are near the site of the 
arrest said police circulated information about a series of attacks on women at 
the end of April. Shai Harary, the manager at The Print Shop in the 22000 block 
of Ventura Boulevard, said police dropped off a flyer with a composite picture 
and description of a man's attacks. "(It said) he would attack people between 
the afternoon hours, women that were walking on Ventura Boulevard in the 
western areas of the Valley," Harary said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stung by criticism of his department last winter, when Valley residents 
complained that authorities did not alert them to a series of attacks on 
children until news reports detailed the incidents, Pomeroy said the flyers are 
proof the police were trying to warn the public about the latest attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is sometimes difficult to make a judgment between releasing information 
too soon when not all the facts are known and yet fully informing the public as 
soon as we are certain of our facts," Pomeroy said. "In this particular case, 
we did not have -- nor do we now have -- sufficient information to believe that 
the individual we have in custody is a serial rapist." 
</P>
<P>
 Some business people in the area said they wished they had been informed 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Hickerson, a manager at La Frite, which is also near Sale Avenue and 
Ventura Boulevard, said there are about 20 women who come alone to the 
restaurant on the way from work or going to their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course they haven't told us anything about it," she said. "It seems like 
if you knew about it you could take added precautions like asking for escorts 
and keeping an eye out for suspicious-looking people."

FIRE DAMAGES OFFICE BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A two-story office building incurred $100,000 in damages when a fire burned 
through a wall and into its attic early Saturday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-five firefighters responded to the alarm in the 8000 block of Reseda 
Boulevard, near Chase Street, according to Brian Humphrey of the Los Angeles 
City Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 It took them 53 minutes to extinguish the blaze, Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Losses were estimated at $80,000 in structural damage and $20,000 damage to 
contents, Humphrey said.

FIRST-TIME BUYERS WHO WAITED SPARK HOUSING REBOUND; REAL ESTATE: AFTER YEARS OF 
ICE-COLD SALES, THE CITY'S WESTSIDE MARKET IS FINALLY STARTING TO HEAT UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SHIBUYA BROWN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Aaroe doesn't go for that ordinary daredevil stuff. He doesn't bungee 
jump from cliffs, race the Formula One circuit or trek through the Himalayas 
looking for Bigfoot. The man doesn't even smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm totally risk-averse," he confesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, last January, Aaroe did something many would find even more daunting. In 
the midst of Southern California's worst real estate recession in decades -- 
with housing prices in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars below their 
level of five years ago -- Aaroe abruptly left the Jon Douglas Co., where he 
had worked for 18 years, to open his own residential realty firm in Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The move did not meet with overwhelming acclaim. Some of Aaroe's friends and 
acquaintances, to put it bluntly, thought he soon would be selling shirts 
instead of homes. "They said it was a terrible thing to be doing," Aaroe 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Not any longer. After several years of downward mobility, the city's housing 
market finally seems to be on the road back from nowhere. And Aaroe, who 
correctly surmised that Southern California's slumping market was about to 
shape up, is suddenly a man with vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his opening, Aaroe has more than doubled his work force -- from 19 to 44 
employees -- and his firm has an inventory of 90 Westside homes worth about 
$145 million. On one busy day two weeks ago, Aaroe's realtors sold $4 million 
worth of property. His second office will open next week in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could see a market that was changing," said Aaroe of his decision to strike 
out on his own -- made just two weeks before he opened for business. "You could 
feel there was slightly less inventory and a few more buyers with consumer 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 No, prosperity may not be just around the corner for Westside residential real 
estate. But from Hancock Park to West Los Angeles to Malibu, real estate agents 
report a dramatic increase in home sales and say their hands are full with 
properties that, for the first time in months, are receiving multiple offers. 
</P>
<P>
 It may not be enough to entirely lift Los Angeles out of its economic 
quagmire, but, for now, the quickened pace is providing hope for the 
once-moribund housing market. Compared with one year ago, the percentage of 
listed homes that sell throughout Los Angeles has nearly doubled -- from 19% to 
34% -- with the bulk of the increase attributable to single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Realtor Jon Douglas said his overall sales of homes were up 40% in March over 
the previous year, and broker Fred Sands said his firm's home sales in March 
were greater than in any month during the last four years. April, he added, 
proved nearly as busy. 
</P>
<P>
 "March and April were gangbusters," Sands said. "There's four years of pent-up 
demand." 
</P>
<P>
 In a city whose mantra is real estate, the prospect of a rebound is being 
received with guarded enthusiasm. Real estate agents acknowledge that the sales 
increase has not been accompanied by a rise in home prices and is mostly a 
result of first-time buyers purchasing less-expensive homes. But they 
nonetheless forecast modest appreciation for most homes in 1994. Moreover, 
compared to the industry's long dearth of home purchasing, any activity on the 
part of buyers, they say, bodes well.  
</P>
<P>
 Real estate experts give several reasons why buyers are suddenly scurrying 
into homes. Perhaps the biggest factors have been the slight rise recently in 
interest rates, coupled with a sense that the housing market has finally 
bottomed out. Both factors, they say, sent messages to potential home buyers 
that the only place for rates and prices to go was upward. 
</P>
<P>
 Literary agent Bill Douglass, for example, recently bought a two-bedroom, 
two-bathroom residence in the "$400,000 range" in south Santa Monica after a 
scant two weeks of looking. Why? Partially for tax reasons, he said, and 
partially because of a perception that finally "the market was going up." 
</P>
<P>
 Another, less tangible reason, brokers say, is the feeling among many 
Angelenos that the area's economy is improving, even though the economics of 
the housing market have not drastically changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really attitude," said Tim Corliss, an Re/Max realtor and past president 
of the Los Angeles Assn. of Realtors. "(A few months ago), prices and interest 
rates were still low but the buyers were still scared. Now there's a 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 And buyers wading into the market take with them more than confidence -- they 
also are armed with a great deal of buying power. In spite of the newfound 
activity, the median prices of homes in many areas have declined. Overall on 
the Westside, the median sales price of a single-family home in 1994 is about 
$35,000 less than it was a year ago; for condominiums, the median price fell 
$13,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the price drop is to be expected, given the decade of dizzying market 
appreciation -- 20% yearly in some areas -- that preceded the recent recession. 
In fact, this was the only downturn in the past 30 years to result in lower 
housing prices, which usually stabilize during lean times. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Corliss, Westside housing prices are still down 30% to 50% from 
their peak of several years ago. He points to one Santa Monica home 10 blocks 
from the beach that he recently sold for $440,000. Seven years ago, just before 
the market topped out, Corliss sold a nearly identical home two blocks away for 
$865,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "More sellers are being realistic, and that's enabling buyers to buy," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Douglass agrees: "The sellers understand (that) they're not going to get 
what they got in 1988." 
</P>
<P>
 Because homes are now being priced more realistically, brokers are facing an 
enviable problem -- a lack of available homes for sale. That shortage is now 
being felt in expensive areas too. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, says John Aaroe realtor Helene Sherman, 13 homes have been 
sold in Trousdale Estates in Beverly Hills -- more than were sold there all of 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Sherman says, a Beverly Hills home that was listed for $895,000 
attracted 27 offers before it sold for nearly $1.1 million. "If it's priced 
right, it's going to get activity." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Sands broker Hilda Cohen agrees: "As soon as a good property comes on the 
market, people swoop down on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all good properties, however, are seeing their stock rise again. A notable 
exception in the Westside's incipient market recovery are condominiums, the 
sales of which have remained stagnant even though they have suffered the same 
downward sticker shock as single-family residences. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, one reason may have to do with the recent surge in house sales. 
Because single-family residences now are competitively priced with condos, 
buyers -- especially first-time home buyers -- are opting for houses instead. 
Even those who would normally consider purchasing a condominium are finding 
that the maintenance fees required by condos could be better used to buy a 
larger, higher-priced single-family home. 
</P>
<P>
 The result has been a glut of condominiums on the market. Among the high-rise 
luxury buildings of the Wilshire Corridor, for example, where maintenance fees 
can easily run more than $1,000 monthly, sales have been virtually nonexistent, 
even for lesser-priced units. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, only two sales of Wilshire Corridor condos priced between 
$180,000 and $250,000 have closed and only 16 have been sold overall. One 
typical example: a two-bedroom, two-bathroom unit in a full-service building, 
complete with 24-hour valets, sauna, Jacuzzi and exercise room. Once appraised 
at more than $325,000, it has now been listed for six months for $100,000 less. 
No bids have been made on the property and fewer than a dozen people have come 
to see it. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are walking away from a lot of these units," said Sherman, who cites 
another case of a luxury condo that was bought for $800,000 a few years ago but 
now will probably sell for less than $500,000, if not lower. "It's going to 
take years for us to absorb (the glut)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Matt Roberts about the state of the condominium market. The Brentwood 
publicist is attempting, so far in vain, to sell a two-bedroom, two-bath, 
1,500-square-foot condo in "great condition." Purchased seven years ago for 
$215,000, Roberts had the property listed for six months last year at $179,500 
with no takers. Now, in what has become a nationwide trend, he plans to give 
the condo to the winner of an essay contest. Entrants will be charged $200 to 
write, in 500 words or less, "Why would you want to live on the Westside of Los 
Angeles?" 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts hopes to attract at least 1,000 entrants and to have their entry fees 
pay off the mortgage. The state attorney general's office has ruled in the past 
that such schemes are against the law because they constitute illegal 
lotteries, but Roberts says his contest will be judged by USC and UCLA English 
professors and that, consequently, it will be a competition based on skill. 
</P>
<P>
 Brokers insist that if Roberts can wait it out, the market will turn for 
condos as well. Once buying becomes the norm again, they say, it will simply be 
a matter of time before all the choice single-family homes are taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, that was precisely the thinking last January of Joel Secarz, 34, when 
he purchased his piece of the American dream -- a 1940ish, three-bedroom, 
two-bath home north of Montana Avenue in Santa Monica. Part of Secarz's 
decision to buy was fueled by his having accumulated a sufficient down payment 
for the $400,000-plus home. The other part was due to the sudden change in home 
prices and interest rates. For the best deal, Secarz said, he figured he'd have 
to act quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "There (are) more houses being sold and there are more buyers out there," said 
Secarz, a first-time homeowner. "People have finally decided that now is the 
time."

NEW BUSINESS COALITION TARGETS REGIONAL WOES; WESTSIDE: LEADERS JOIN TO FORM 
LOBBYING GROUP, WITH THE IDEA THAT BIGGER IS BETTER -- OR AT LEAST LOUDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN STEINBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Westside business leaders are banding together, hoping to press for solutions 
to regional problems ranging from traffic to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the effort, being led by four utility companies, is to form a 
Westside Assn. of Chambers of Commerce that would include as many as 14 local 
chambers to lobby state and local government officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issues facing the Westside are transcending municipal boundaries," said 
Bill Boyd, executive director of the Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce. "Our 
Westside cities now all have similar concerns, and our shared goal is to 
address those problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea behind the new association is that bigger is better -- or, at least, 
louder. The coalition, expected to be in place later this summer, will send a 
clearer message from the local business community to state and local 
policy-makers, said Mark Olson, area manager for Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have more clout because more business leaders are involved," Olson 
said, asserting that politicians would be more responsive when approached by a 
single group representing numerous chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking bans, for example, would have been a good issue for the new business 
group to have been involved in, Olson said. The association could have taken 
part in discussions and made uniform recommendations on the bans, which have 
been passed in many Westside cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson said the interest of Edison and the three other utilities leading the 
effort -- The Gas Co., Pacific Bell and GTE -- is similar to that of all 
prospective members of the association: to prevent business flight and improve 
the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The group says numerous cross-border problems are worsening the local business 
climate -- Santa Monica Boulevard traffic backing up from West Hollywood into 
Beverly Hills, panhandlers staking out corners in Hollywood and Venice, crime 
throughout the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no single project is on the association's agenda so far, one group 
member hopes to drum up support for light-rail transit service on the 
Exposition line, the Southern Pacific railroad right of way that runs east and 
west parallel to Santa Monica Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 At an initial meeting of more than a dozen local chambers last month, it was 
determined that a key priority of Westside communities is to promote the 
entertainment industry, said California Film Commission Director Patti Stolkin 
Archuletta, who attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry's impact on the local economy is undeniable, she said, pointing 
out that the Westside is home to Fox, Sony and Paramount studios, and a 
proliferation of related businesses including post-production, audio and 
special-effects companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are finally getting away from provincial thinking, and are starting to 
see things regionally," Archuletta said. "They are beginning to work on 
regional solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 The drive to create an association of Westside chambers follows similar 
efforts elsewhere in the Los Angeles area. South Bay chambers have banded 
together to address problems affecting the aerospace industry, and business 
organizations in Ventura County also have joined forces, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the new Westside Assn. of Chambers marks the second time local 
chambers have tried to present a common front. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in 1985, an association of Westside chambers was created and 
addressed a range of regional issues over a two-year period. Among other 
efforts, the group successfully fought a proposal to restrict the use of 
billboards in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization disbanded in 1987 after a change in leadership, said Bill 
Welsh, a founder of that group who is now president emeritus of the Hollywood 
Chamber of Commerce and a participant in the new association. 
</P>
<P>
 Welsh and other organizers of the new group say business organizations must 
band together now because the riots of 1992, last year's fires and the Jan. 17 
earthquake have dealt the Westside serious economic blows, heightening the 
importance of retaining businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the '80s the economy was going great guns. During that time, businesses 
did not need to band together," said Olson. "Now they do."

MIKE DOWNEY: PASADENA PROVES IT IS QUITE A SITE

 Mexico's soccer team ran onto the field Saturday in its traditional green 
shirts, white shorts and red knee-high stockings. Oh, except for Jorge Campos, 
the goalie, Senor Day-Glo, who wore another of his wild, colorful, clown-like 
costumes, usually seen only on Renaldo McDonald.  
</P>
<P>
 Then the team from the soccer-loving United States of America ran onto the 
Pasadena pasture before a tremendous crowd of 91,123, including the estimated 
1,123 who didn't come to cheer for Mexico.  
</P>
<P>
 Final score? 
</P>
<P>
 Yankees 1, red socks nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 With a perfect pass from Eric Wynalda to Roy Wegerle that caught Campos out of 
position and resulted in what Wynalda called "90,000 worried-looking 
Mexican-Americans," the U.S. team won this final warm-up game, 1-0, to prepare 
itself for the serious kicking to come.  
</P>
<P>
 But the real winner? 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena, USA.  
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Pasadena, soccer capital of this great soccer-loving universe of ours, 
held one final full dress rehearsal Saturday on the same green, green grass 
where the World Cup tournament's July 17 championship game will be played. And 
Pasadena passed the test. Grass, great. Weather, warm. Organization, orderly. 
Crowd control, efficient. Excellent work by everybody here at the Toes Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
 We're ready for Soccer Summer '94. Soccer fever. Catch it. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team looks ready, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what the key to Saturday's 1-0 victory was, defender Cle Kooiman quickly 
said, "The zero goals against is the key. I'll tell you what, if we can stop 
teams from scoring, I can guarantee you at least three ties." 
</P>
<P>
 Good key, Cle. In the first round, the U.S. only plays three games.  
</P>
<P>
 And Mexico? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it isn't yet evident whether Mexico's team is ready. The team has been 
victorious in only two of its seven pre-Cup games. On the other hand, it was 
playing Saturday without the great Luis Roberto Alves Zague, alias "Zaguinho," 
striker extraordinaire, and also without Hugo Sanchez, equally legendary 
striker, who recently gave an interview in which he said he was happy to 
"sacrifice my individual brilliance" for the sake of the team. Bravo, Hugo.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, Mexico's many fans must be getting anxious.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody will panic over this, but it's still a great team," U.S. defender 
Alexi Lalas said. "Oh, I don't really care whether they panic or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Is Mexico's coach, Miguel Mejia Baron, panicky? 
</P>
<P>
 Hard to tell. In a lengthy post-game interview Saturday, the most outspoken 
comment Coach Baron made was that the World Cup will begin June 17.  
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Baron said of his team's performance, "The game just ended five 
minutes ago. This is a game that I have to think about once, twice, three 
times." 
</P>
<P>
 No problem, Miguel. Give us a call after your tri-think.  
</P>
<P>
 One reason Mexico's fans turned out in great numbers is because they cannot be 
positive they will see their heroes here in California again soon. The first 
three World Cup games for Mexico will be played in Washington, twice, and 
Orlando, Fla., not an easy commute.  
</P>
<P>
 So, you mean 91,000 fans came across the border for this one game? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no, no," corrected the U.S. coach, Bora Milutinovic. "They live here. 
They didn't come from out of the country. Mexico's team is very much loved 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 More than our own team, maybe.  
</P>
<P>
 Wynalda was asked, "Did this feel like a road game to you?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Why?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, they booed us," Wynalda said. "We got booed on our home field. That's a 
strange feeling, let me tell you." 
</P>
<P>
 Wynalda, the local-boy Westlake Villager, covered half of the San Fernando 
Valley on his way to assisting on the goal. He outran Ignacio Ambriz, got Raul 
Gutierrez to commit in midair, then faked out Juan Ramirez Perales by passing 
instead of shooting. By the time Ramon Ramirez could make a last-second lunge, 
Wegerle was booting the ball past the orange-yellow-purple-green sleeve of 
Campos into the lower-right webbing of the net.  
</P>
<P>
 Campos, said Wynalda, "He's always making forwards' life miserable. You never 
know what he's going to do.  
</P>
<P>
 "They said he didn't play the shot correctly. The way he plays, how can you 
tell?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, you know how it is, Eric.  
</P>
<P>
 Everybody has an opinion, here in soccer-crazy America.

SMOLTZ, MCGRIFF STYMIE DODGERS; BASEBALL: THE BRAVES IMPROVE TO 17-1 AGAINST 
THE NL WEST AND 5-0 AGAINST L.A., 4-2.

 The Atlanta Braves, who are tough on the Dodgers anywhere, play them 
especially well at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, where the Dodgers lost 
Saturday night for the 15th time in their last 18 games here, 4-2, before a 
sellout crowd of 49,257. 
</P>
<P>
 John Smoltz (3-6), who is especially tough on the Dodgers, finally won for the 
first time in eight starts, holding the Dodgers to five hits in eight innings, 
including solo home runs by Raul Mondesi and Eric Karros.  
</P>
<P>
 "Finally, I get to sit here and talk about my performance and not just applaud 
others," said Smoltz, who has pitched well in his last seven starts but has 
suffered from poor run support. "It's been a long time, and I am glad it's 
over. One thing I learned is not to let anything anybody says affect me 
anymore. It's funny to hear certain statements when you are so-called 
struggling." 
</P>
<P>
 The entire National League West is struggling against the Braves, who may be 
out of the division but are still dominating it. They have beaten NL West 
opponents 17 out of 18 games this season, with a 5-0 record against the 
Dodgers, including a three-game sweep at Dodger Stadium. The Dodgers' 3-15 
record in Atlanta dates to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a team that is like '92 or '93," said Karros, who has three home 
runs and 10 runs batted in in his last eight games. ". . . We feel like we can 
play well, but we aren't playing well right now and didn't play well at home.  
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't think Fred McGriff is swinging like he is capable of -- granted 
he hit that homer tonight -- and (David) Justice is struggling. They aren't 
hitting on all cylinders either, but they have their pitching and their hits 
are timely. Our hits haven't been timely for a while. You win with timely 
hits." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Gross (4-3), also pitched well, except for a hanging curveball that 
became a three-run homer in the fifth inning, McGriff's 15th homer this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a game of inches, and if I get the double play on (Jeff) Blauser's 
grounder to short before McGriff comes up, then I'm out of the inning," Gross 
said. "I'm not saying that we should have turned the double play, I'm just 
saying that I'd rather not face McGriff with two guys on.  
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, these young guys (second baseman Garey Ingram and shortstop Eddie Pye) 
who just came up are doing a great job, they are hitting the ball and they 
turned a double play after that. I'm just saying it's a game of inches." 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram made his eighth start at second base and Pye got his first major league 
start in place of Jose Offerman, who was benched. Offerman is batting .197. 
</P>
<P>
 Pye, who is the best shortstop off the bench but is normally a second baseman, 
said he and Ingram did their best. "If he and I had a little more experience 
and we had played together more, that same play again (against Blauser) we 
would have turned," said Pye, who had never played with Ingram. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoltz, who got two hits against Gross, pointed to the third inning as the 
turning point in the game. With two runners on and one out, Smoltz came back 
from a 3-and-0 count against Ingram to strike him out. He then struck out 
Piazza swinging and went on to retire the next 12 in a row until Mondesi 
homered to lead off the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg McMichael pitched the ninth inning for his 13th save.

BREWERS SPOIL RETURN OF SNOW TO ANGELS, 7-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 J.T. Snow picked up a newspaper before leaving for his flight Saturday morning 
from Colorado Springs, Colo. He yanked out the sports section and immediately 
checked the pitching matchups. 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't believe it. The Angels were to face the Milwaukee Brewers' Bill 
Wegman -- who pitched the season-opener last year against the Angels. Snow hit 
a home run in his second at-bat of the 1993 season against Wegman, and by the 
end of April, was a household name in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like deja vu, " Snow said as the Angels lost to the Brewers, 7-6, in 
11 innings before 23,952 at Anaheim Stadium. "I guess it was meant to be that 
this is my season opener." 
</P>
<P>
 There were few dramatics from Snow, who had two singles and made a sharp 
defensive play in his season debut. The Angels' Chad Curtis and Jim Edmonds 
each hit two-run homers, but John Jaha's run-scoring single in the 11th sent 
the Angels to their sixth consecutive loss after Turner Ward's two-out, two-run 
homer against Joe Grahe in the ninth had sent the game into extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
 With the presence of Snow, the Angels were hitting again, scoring one fewer 
run than in their last four games combined. And once again, reporters were back 
clamoring around Snow's locker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him that (he is) not here to carry this team," Angel Manager Marcel 
Lachemann said. " 'You're not here to do anything but be J.T. Snow.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Snow isn't about to ask any questions. The resentment and bitterness are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned a lot, I'll say that," said Snow, who batted .296 at triple-A 
Vancouver with eight homers and 43 runs batted in. "I don't think anything 
surprises me anymore in this game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels acknowledge that perhaps it was a mistake to send Snow to Vancouver 
in the first place. Saturday, Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi said that 
perhaps he should have insisted that Snow open the season at first base and 
Eduardo Perez play at third. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe in hindsight," Bavasi said, "there were certain moves we should have 
made and didn't, and certain moves we shouldn't have made and did. We're now 
making moves that we should have made earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi's biggest regret, he said, was that he didn't personally explore the 
possibility of Perez playing third base. He was told that a strained elbow 
ligament would preclude Perez from returning to third. The Angels tried Perez 
in left field this spring, and when that didn't work, their only option was 
first base. 
</P>
<P>
 It became clear three weeks ago to Bavasi, however, that this wasn't working. 
The team was simply making too many mistakes defensively, and changes were 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 So he had a long talk with Dr. Lewis Yocum about Perez's elbow. Yocum assured 
him that Perez's elbow was no more endangered at third base than first base. 
The plan then became quite simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not second-guessing anyone but me," Bavasi said. "I'm not blaming Buck 
(Rodgers) or anyone else. I never felt comfortable at the minor league level 
moving guys around, and I don't feel comfortable now. That's poor development." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi and the Angel management simply decided the team could not win without 
making defensive changes. They no longer could live with the Dwight Smith-Bo 
Jackson platoon in left field, and the defense at first was lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our defense was very average, at best," Angel shortstop Gary 
DiSarcina said. "That's just one area where you can't afford to be average. 
When you're pitching isn't like it should be, defense is what lifts them up. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I think J.T. has a way of lifting everyone up."

BURE'S EJECTION PENALIZES CANUCKS IN LOSS TO RANGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An instant of carelessness by Pavel Bure Saturday cost the Vancouver Canucks 
their best offensive threat and probably Game 3 of the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Bure, who had scored his first goal of the series 63 seconds into the game, 
was ejected at 18:21 of the first period for high-sticking New York Ranger 
defenseman Jay Wells above the left eye and breaking his nose as they fought 
for the puck along the boards. Later, as the Canucks sifted through the ruins 
of their 5-1 loss and assessed their 2-1 series deficit, they lamented what 
might have been if Bure had kept his stick and temper under control. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pavel felt as good as he has all series. We had some good opportunities and 
it looked like we had some legs," said Bure's center, Trevor Linden. "It's a 
tough thing, just because of the mixing and matching of lines and obviously, 
he's a great player and he's leading the league in playoff (goal) scoring." 
</P>
<P>
 Bure said he thought at worst that referee Andy van Hellemond should have 
given him two two-minute minor penalties instead of a five-minute major and a 
game misconduct. He said he was trying to use his body on Wells, as the Canucks 
had been instructed to do against the Ranger defense, but missed Wells with his 
shoulder and instead got him with the stick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my stick just slid and hit him in the face," said Bure, who was fined 
$500 during Vancouver's quarterfinal series against Dallas for a vicious elbow 
against Shane Churla. "Lots of guys told me I should get two and two, but I got 
kicked out of the game. It was too bad, because I felt very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver Coach Pat Quinn, who doubted the severity of Wells' injuries, 
contended two minors would have been punishment enough. However, Bryan Lewis, 
the NHL's director of officiating, said van Hellemond believed Bure wasn't 
attempting to play the puck and that the injury was caused by carelessness, not 
by accident. According to NHL rules, that dictated giving Bure a major penalty 
and a game misconduct. Van Hellemond could have called a match penalty if he 
thought Bure had tried to injure Wells. 
</P>
<P>
 "He called it right," said NHL Senior Vice President Brian Burke, who reviewed 
the play and will not suspend Bure. "He cut him right in the face. Guys have 
got to be responsible for their sticks." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers, naturally, were delighted to see him go. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly took a player out of their lineup that we had to be aware of 
every time he's on the ice," said defenseman Brian Leetch. "Defensively, we 
still had to watch out for their men, but he's a game-breaker, and to have him 
off really helped." 
</P>
<P>
 Leetch assumed the role of game-breaker, scoring twice and giving the Canucks 
much to think about before Game 4 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 His first goal, a shot from the left point, bounced off the arm of Vancouver 
goalie Kirk McLean at 13:39 of the first period, tying the score at 1-1 and 
silencing the roaring crowd at the Pacific Coliseum. His second goal, a slicing 
back-hander off a rebound at 18:32 of the second period, sent the Rangers into 
the second intermission with a commanding 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was my hero tonight, as I told him on the ice," said right wing Glenn 
Anderson, who had given the Rangers a 2-1 lead by deflecting a shot by Sergei 
Nemchinov through McLean's legs at 19:19 of the second period. "Brian Leetch is 
a phenomenal hockey player." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Leetch: "I think we played a really good road game. Once we were able to 
get the lead, you don't want to take too many chances." 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn said he was most disturbed that his players "weren't hungry enough" to 
get open for passes. They played into the Rangers' hands, he said, by handling 
the puck too much and making plays individually rather than as a team. Hockey 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers' final goal, by Alexei Kovalev, was the first power-play goal of 
the series. New York is one for 15 and Vancouver is 0 for 17. . . . Ranger 
defenseman Sergei Zubov (bruised chest) was a late scratch and was replaced by 
Jay Wells. He is possible for Tuesday.

TWINS GOPHER BROKE, ROUT TIGERS, 21-7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the way the runs were piling up in the Minnesota Twins' 21-7 victory, 
Detroit Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson wasn't sure what sport he was watching 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the University of Minnesota against the University of Michigan playing 
a practice football game," Anderson said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 With Twin sluggers Kirby Puckett and Dave Winfield getting a day off, Pedro 
Munoz homered twice and drove in a career-high seven runs as the Twins tied 
team records for runs and hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Cole had four of the Twins' 24 hits. Scott Leius, who homered, and Derek 
Parks and Munoz each had three hits for Minnesota. Chip Hale added a two-run 
homer in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Twins' 21 runs tied the mark set on May 20 against Boston. The 24 hits 
matched the club record set on May 25, 1977, against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hit some balls good and we hit some into the holes," Twin Manager Tom 
Kelly said. "It turned a little ugly the last three or four innings when we 
couldn't catch popups or ground balls. I don't know whether we lost 
concentration or what, but it's hard to criticize anything when you score 21 
runs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Twins won despite making five errors. Detroit had not given up so many 
runs and hits since Kansas City scored 21 runs and had 24 hits on June 15, 
1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the final score was reminiscent of old Lion-Viking games at Tiger 
Stadium -- the NFL used the park through 1974 -- Anderson said it could have 
been worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the seventh, I thought I'd see something I'd never seen before -- a team 
get to 30 hits," he said. "They were at 22 and there were no outs. That's a 
frightening feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it got to 13-0 I said, 'Get this over as fast as you can and please 
don't let anyone get hurt.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Munoz had a two-run single during a six-run second inning and hit a three-run 
homer as the Twins scored six times in the third for the 13-0 lead. Munoz added 
a sacrifice fly in the fifth and led off the seventh with his third homer of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Munoz said he hoped his performance would earn him more playing time. He came 
into the afternoon with only one homer and six RBIs in 29 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been sitting on the bench a lot, which is new to me," he said. "I never 
played platoon before, and it's something I have to get used to. When you play 
every day, you feel more comfortable. You have your timing down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today I showed I can hit, but in my mind, there never was a question." 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Samuel homered, tripled twice and drove in three runs for Detroit.

JIM MURRAY: NUMBERS DON'T LIE ON JEFFERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The subject for today is "What's So Smart About Baseball?" Part IV.  
</P>
<P>
 Every time I see Gregory Scott Jefferies in the uniform of the St. Louis 
Cardinals, I feel like cracking myself on the side of the head. Or getting my 
eye checked.  
</P>
<P>
 It's a puzzlement, as the king of Siam would say. Only two years ago, Gregg 
was in the uniform of the Kansas City Royals. Before that, he was in the livery 
of the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
 Now usually, when a guy sets sail through the majors like that, he is a 
marginal player. Trade bait. Stuck in the window with a price tag or a "Make 
offer" label. Or even "Marked down. Priced to move." 
</P>
<P>
 You figure the guy can't hit the curveball or strikes out a lot. Sometimes, 
he's just a clubhouse lawyer, a malcontent or chronically injured. "Have .220 
average, will travel." 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferies is none of the above. He is an elite player, if you go by the 
numbers that baseball, the decimal capital of the world, always does. His 
manager, Joe Torre, says he is one of the best hitters in the game. He doesn't 
have a weakness.  
</P>
<P>
 Consider the numbers: Last year, Andres Galarraga was the batting champion of 
the National League with a .370 average. San Diego's Tony Gwynn was second at 
.358. Gregg Jefferies was third at .342.  
</P>
<P>
 But, under the old rules, which specified that a batsman must have 500 
official at-bats to qualify for the championship, only Jefferies, with 544, 
would have qualified.  
</P>
<P>
 The rule was changed in the mid-'50s after Ted Williams had batted .345 one 
year, only to see Bobby Avila named champion with .341. The next year, Williams 
hit .356, only to see Al Kaline crowned champ with .340. The problem was, ol' 
Teddy Ballgame was being walked so much he couldn't compile the required 
at-bats.  
</P>
<P>
 The rule was changed to qualify a champion if he made 500 appearances at the 
plate, regardless of whether he walked, hit sacrifice flies or got hit by 
pitches. It was just in time. Williams batted .388 the next year. Baseball 
would have been embarrassed to make him a loser with that kind of an average. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferies, though, is not interested in technicalities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an honor just to be mentioned in the same breath as Tony Gwynn," he said 
earnestly the other night at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferies, of course, should still be in a Met uniform. The Mets don't have 
too many people mentioned in the same breath as Tony Gwynn.  
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, they traded him to Kansas City for a Cy Young Award-winning 
pitcher, Bret Saberhagen. There is a rule of thumb in baseball, if you trade 
daringly, trade for a pitcher.  
</P>
<P>
 But it doesn't always work. Saberhagen with New York the last two seasons was 
3-5, 7-7. He is 6-2 this season, but even that isn't Cy Young stuff. Young 
Master Jefferies, meanwhile, hit .285 in his year with K.C. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the first time trading for a pitcher backfired. The Cincinnati Reds 
once traded Frank Robinson, no less, for pitcher Milt Pappas. They gave the 
Baltimore Orioles several pennants and World Series.  
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago Cubs topped that, though. They traded once for pitcher Ernie 
Broglio. They gave the Cardinals Lou Brock for him. You'll find Brock listed as 
the all-time National League base-stealer with 938 thefts. That Lou Brock. 
Broglio won 14 and lost 31 for the Cubs. That Ernie Broglio.  
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals got Orlando Cepeda for pitcher Ray Sadecki. Cepeda had Hall of 
Fame abilities. Sadecki had American Assn. abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Any trade is a crapshoot. Or a shot in your foot. But putting a player of 
Jefferies' stature on the counter is courting front-office disaster. 
Reputations are ruined. You tend to get remembered for serious blunders. They 
make better copy than successes or trades that were standoffs. That Nirvana of 
the trading block -- the trade that helps both clubs, rarely materializes. More 
likely is the trade that helps neither club. Or, that dread of the general 
manager, the trade that returns to haunt you. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to see what the game wants out of Jefferies. At New York, the vets 
were annoyed by him because he: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Showed up for work. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tried hard. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Took defeat personally. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hit .276. 
</P>
<P>
 You can see where that would tick off a guy getting $2 million a year for 
doing none of the above -- at least not every day.  
</P>
<P>
 But when Kansas City traded him, it was for Felix Jose, a player so little 
known that most people think he wears his name backward. Jose hit .253 last 
year. Jefferies was almost 100 points higher. Power? Jose had six home runs, 
Jefferies 16. Speed? Jose had 31 stolen bases, Jefferies 46.  
</P>
<P>
 "Jefferies gives us exactly what we want," says Torre. "He's aggressive at the 
plate and on the bases. He's a switch-hitter, so you can't change pitchers on 
him, and he's equally able from either side. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides, he's a throwback. He manages to get dirty even on the AstroTurf 
fields. Some guys wouldn't get dirty in a mud bath, but he'd get dirty in a 
hotel lobby. Certainly by the third inning, he looks like one of the old Gas 
House Gang Cardinals." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Jefferies was surprised when the Royals put him on the block. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, I had gone to arbitration," he said. "But when the rumors came up, 
even George Brett scoffed. 'They'll never trade a good hitter like you -- who'd 
they get?' he told me. Two days later I was gone." 
</P>
<P>
 At the close of business Saturday, Gregg Jefferies was batting a robust .328 
with five home runs, 12 doubles, 20 runs and six steals. And a dirty uniform.  
</P>
<P>
 It's not likely the Cardinals will trade him. But that doesn't mean he won't 
move. The general manager who might relocate him is Gregg Jefferies. He becomes 
a free agent next year. Jefferies might put Jefferies on the road again.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was a huge Dodger fan growing up," he says. "But they're pretty well set at 
first base." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mets got a Cy Young pitcher for him. The Royals got a guy with two first 
names. What will Jefferies get for him? Probably a no-trade contract -- and a 
sign to put up over his locker: "Even Babe Ruth Got Traded." 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball never learns.

<P>
 Police officers in Orlando, Fla. have been schooled in what to expect from the 
Dutch soccer fans at the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, the fans like to take the hats off police officers and plant a 
kiss on their lips.  
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Wright, Orlando's deputy chief in charge of World Cup planning, says 
his officers will be more than tolerant of this kind of behavior, especially 
the taking of department-issued baseball caps. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he says his officers will discourage fans giving them kisses. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: When was the last time an Indiana team played in the NBA finals? 
</P>
<P>
 Oxygen debt: At Coors Field in Denver, the Colorado Rockies' new ballpark that 
will open next season, one row of seats, about three-fourths of the way up the 
upper deck, will be exactly one mile above sea level. The row will be painted 
purple. 
</P>

 The color of fans' faces?

 Forgettable round: At the Worst Avid Golfer competition at the TPC Sawgrass 
(Fla.) course in 1985, Angelo Spagnolo scored a 66 on the par-three 17th hole, 
with an island green, and a 22 on No. 18 for a 257. 
</P>
<P>
 On 17 he put 27 balls in the water before putting one on the peninsula cartway 
path.  
</P>
<P>
 Quote drought: Paul O'Neill of the New York Yankees is making a lot of noise 
with his bat with an average of over .400.  
</P>
<P>
 However, he comes up empty in the interview department. "I know you 
(reporters) want great quotes," O'Neill said. "I just don't have them." 
</P>
<P>
 Debunking the dunk: In "Tall Tales" by Terry Pluto, former NBA star Oscar 
Robertson said that dunking is a showboat play. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the stars in my era could dunk, but we saw no reason to do it," Robertson 
said. "We had too much respect for each other to try and dunk in each other's 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dunk, the behind-the-back garbage -- those aren't great plays and they 
aren't skilled plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Faltering franchises: Art Spander in the San Francisco Examiner, on the San 
Diego Padres and Oakland Athletics, who are in last place in their divisions 
despite recent winning streaks: 
</P>
<P>
 "Losing to the A's or Padres is like drowning in two inches of water."  
</P>
<P>
 No interceptions: Boston Red Sox trainer Charlie Moss, after Boston's recent 
21-2 loss to the Minnesota Twins:  
</P>
<P>
 "We were doing all right until the defensive backs started falling on the 
crossing patterns."  
</P>
<P>
 Head case: Mir Zaman Gul of Pakistan was recently fined $750 for head-butting. 
Earlier he was fined $2,250 and suspended for four months for the same reason.

GOLF ROUNDUP; WADKINS LEADS BROOKS BY TWO AFTER THIRD ROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bobby Wadkins did what his brother, Lanny, said he had to do Saturday -- he 
drove the ball well and stayed in the fairways. That reduced his bogeys to one 
and gave him seven birdies in a six-under-par 65. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Brooks did what he has been doing for three days and shot a 69. 
</P>
<P>
 The two distanced themselves from the field at the Kemper Open at the TPC at 
Avenal course in Potomac, Md., Wadkins at 13-under 200 and Brooks two shots 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The next golfers, Phil Mickelson, D.A. Weibring and Mark O'Meara are at 206. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mark and Bobby have kind of separated themselves," Mickelson said. "The 
leaders aren't going to come back. The only way to beat them is to shoot a 
really low score." 
</P>
<P>
 Wadkins did just that on Saturday, after getting into the tournament with a 
sponsor's exemption. He has not won in a PGA Tour career that began in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks hasn't been on the tour as long but is a more established player, with 
three victories in 11 years. The last was in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played reasonably solid today. I'd rather be ahead, but two shots is not a 
whole lot," Brooks said. "If we both play real good front nines tomorrow, it 
could turn into match play." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Charles took advantage of a forgiving Greystone Golf Club course, wet from 
a rainstorm that interrupted play after he had completed only one hole, and 
shot his second consecutive six-under 66 for a one-shot lead over Larry Gilbert 
after two rounds of the Bruno's Memorial Classic, near Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles had three pairs of birdies, on Nos. 4 and 5, 11 and 12 and 16 and 17, 
with solid iron play taking pressure off his putter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Daniel, seeking her second tournament victory in a row, overcame a shaky 
start in the third round for a two-under 70 and a four-stroke lead over Lisa 
Kiggens in the LPGA Oldsmobile Classic at the Walnut Hills Country Club in East 
Lansing, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong finish put Daniel at 16-under 200 in her bid for her 29th victory, 
one shy of qualifying for entry in the LPGA Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Former U.S. amateur champion Justin Leonard of Texas shot a 69 for a 17-under 
271 and won the individual medal at the NCAA men's golf championship at the 
Stonebridge Country Club course in McKinney, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford finished at 23-under 1,129 and won the team title by four shots over 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard will turn professional Monday when he tries to qualify at Rockville, 
Md., for the U.S. Open.

FRENCH OPEN / WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH; RAIN FALLS ON PIERCE'S PARADE IN 
PARIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The French were singing in the rain Saturday at Roland Garros Stadium, but 
they will have to wait until today to finish their ode to Mary Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 After waiting four hours for the sky to clear and the highly anticipated 
French Open women's final between Pierce and Spain's Arantxa Sanchez Vicario to 
begin, 17,000 fans were sent home when the match was suspended after 17 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, 19, hoping to become the first French women's champion in Paris since 
1967, was leading, 2-1, and held a break point in the fourth game. 
</P>
<P>
 The match is scheduled to be completed before today's all-Spanish men's final 
between Sergi Bruguera and Alberto Berasategui. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain has not forced the men's and women's Grand Slam finals to be held on the 
same day since they started playing on different days in 1979. The last time 
there was a rain delay at any Grand Slam event was at Wimbledon in 1989. In 
1973, the French Open men's final was postponed for two days because of the 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
 That the French Tennis Federation decided to start the match on a cold, 
blustery day was surprising. But it had more to do with the audience than the 
athletes. A brief statement said the match was started out of respect for the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez Vicario's coach, Gabriel Urpi, was asked if it was fair to play under 
the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should ask it to the tournament (officials)," he said. "If you look at 
the interest of the players only, it is better to cancel the match." 
</P>
<P>
 But if they had postponed it earlier, they might have faced another French 
Revolution. Pierce, who has dual citizenship in the United States and France, 
has given women's tennis -- and the fanatical French sporting public -- a 
desperately needed boost the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 That much was evident as fans huddled in the foyers to stay warm while waiting 
for the rain to subside. As the day faded into a gray evening, the rain let up 
and fans crowded into the Center Court stadium. When the officials and ballboys 
and ballgirls marched out in preparation for the final, the audience stirred in 
its seats. Brightly colored umbrellas opened as a light mist sprayed the 
stadium, and a festive mood prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the players did not show. 
</P>
<P>
 As the minutes passed, the Parisians started clapping, singing and, yes, doing 
their version of the wave. Haughty and upright Roland Garros started looking 
like a football stadium in Ohio on a cold November afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 They were placated briefly when Pierce went to the players' seats to converse 
with her coach, Nick Bollettieri. Knowing 17,000 pairs of eyes were on her, she 
waved as she returned to the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, about half an hour after the umpires had taken their positions, Pierce 
and Sanchez Vicario walked onto the red clay, following two ballgirls carrying 
their bottled water and drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 And the noisy gathering became still when Pierce served the first game. After 
each point, fans urged each other to hush. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the noise resumed when Sanchez Vicario served. The No. 2-ranked player 
had defeated Julie Halard of France on Center Court in a quarterfinal last 
week, so she said Pierce's strong following did not bother her. 
</P>
<P>
 But it seemed as if it might do so on the damp, windswept court. Sanchez 
Vicario, playing in her fifth Grand Slam tournament final, made 11 unforced 
errors and Pierce seven in their brief encounter. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is just nothing much to say about the match," Urpi said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least not until today.

FRENCH OPEN / MEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH; A SURE THING: TITLE WILL REMAIN IN 
SPAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One is Catalan, the other Basque. But today, Sergi Bruguera and Alberto 
Berasategui will play for all of Spain when they meet for the French Open men's 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 And the cynics say that's all they will be playing for as the finale of the 
world's premier clay-court tournament has been banished to Iberia. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt Bruguera, of Barcelona, and Berasategui, of Arrigoriaga, will be 
doing hard time today at Roland Garros Stadium, where they have swarmed all 
comers with unshakable ground strokes. It could be a three-hour blinking 
contest, with the No. 6 Bruguera trying to become the ninth man to defend 
successfully a French Open title. 
</P>
<P>
 Berasategui, ranked 23rd, will be trying to make history, as well. He wants to 
become the fourth man to win the French Open without losing a set -- the last 
being Bjorn Borg in 1978 and 1980 -- and the second unseeded champion. Mats 
Wilander did it in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, one will become the fifth Spanish champion of the French Open, and 
although that might not pique the interest of many, it is nonetheless an 
intriguing prospect. Even King Juan Carlos of Spain is expected to be in Paris 
for the grand event. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Berasategui left the Palmer Academy tennis school in Florida, he moved 
to Barcelona to train with Spain's top players, including Bruguera. The two 
have become good friends, often practicing together, eating out and going to 
discos. Now they will be battling for the one Grand Slam tournament title that 
means more to the Spanish than the three others combined. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sergi doesn't want to play Alberto," said Imanol Bellegui, Berasategui's 
youth coach. "(Bruguera) has all the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 The way Berasategui, 20, clobbers those deadly wayward shots, few like facing 
him on clay. He hits forehands with a backhand grip in one of tennis' most 
unusual swings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is absolutely (a) world-class forehand," said Magnus Larsson, who lost to 
Berasategui in a 72-minute semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruguera, 23, knows it as well as anyone. He sees it during practice, and has 
defeated his young rival in two of their three matches. Both victories have 
come on clay this year -- at Barcelona and Monte Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruguera has lost only one set -- against Jim Courier in his semifinal victory 
Friday -- en route to the final. What has distinguished him and Berasategui 
from other competitors in Paris is sure-footed quickness on the unforgiving 
clay.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I am the fastest player in the world, but I am very quick and 
I have to take advantage of that," the 5-foot-8 Berasategui said. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be a footrace against Bruguera, who does not make many errors as he 
sends arcing shots deep to his opponents' baseline. And Bruguera seems to have 
improved with each match, particularly in defeating No. 4 Andrei Medvedev in 
the quarterfinals and No. 7 Courier in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not surprised by what has happened, Luis Bruguera, Sergi's father and 
coach, thinks his son can improve. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can do better than this," the elder Bruguera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that's a scary thought.

POINT OF VIEW / BOB OATES: ALL-TIME FUMBLE; USC ALUMNI HALL OF FAME VOTERS 
INSULT FOOTBALL PLAYERS WHO MADE SCHOOL NATIONALLY PROMINENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When this was a younger century, USC football moved in and up as practically 
all there was to Los Angeles sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Little else of importance found its way onto the sports pages of the city's 
five or six daily newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the American South, East and Midwest, where, before television, before 
air travel, the West Coast seemed a distant, mythic dream, few sports fans even 
knew there was anything else out here. 
</P>
<P>
 What they did know about was Trojan football. 
</P>
<P>
 For, in the late '20s and early '30s, the opening of transcontinental radio 
sports coverage coincided with the beginnings of USC's football greatness. 
</P>
<P>
 In that era, the Trojans always seemed to be heading for, playing in, or at 
least playing for the Rose Bowl -- once getting there three times in four 
years, and winning all three. 
</P>
<P>
 Or they were winning national football championships -- three in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Or they were struggling with Knute Rockne, whose Notre Dame teams won three 
one-point decisions from USC in four years, 13-12, 7-6, and 13-12. In the midst 
of all that, the Trojans beat Rockne in 1928, 27-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Those Trojans, indeed, won half of their school's first eight Notre Dame games 
-- and most of their other games as well -- as millions of Americans learned 
for the first time about the University of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as they've usually called it, Southern Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how, in one decade, a provincial little Los Angeles school in the 
disconnected Far West was transformed into a national institution -- a national 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 And 10 Trojans had the most to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 As the 1920s rolled into the '30s, a football coach named Howard Jones and his 
nine consensus All-Americans led USC into a national prominence that it has 
held since. 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, when USC finally got around to establishing an athletic Hall of 
Fame this year, those 10 should have been the first -- and only -- Trojans 
elected.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, when the 52 voters -- mostly younger alumni -- selected 16 athletes 
and others for the introductory Hall of Fame class, they got 15 names wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the history-makers who deserve election, they recognized only the coach, 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 That was an extraordinary affront to the rest of those who helped get USC 
going. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, only four of those the electors chose -- O.J. Simpson, John McKay, 
Braven Dyer and Jones -- should even have been considered. And of these, on 
reflection, only Jones rates membership in the charter class. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 52 voters, whoever they are, plainly lack both a sense of history 
at their own university and any interest in reading up on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Theirs is an all-time fumble. THE REAL HALL OF FAME 
</P>
<P>
 On any big-news meter these days, a sports hall of fame isn't in it with 
Bosnia, perhaps, or even the NBA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, injustice is injustice, wherever you find it. 
</P>
<P>
 And in this case, USC's alumni have wronged the school's first nine 
All-Americans, four of whom, lining up as tailbacks, were called quarterbacks: 
Mort Kaer, Morley Drury, Gaius Shaver and Cotton Warburton. 
</P>
<P>
 In a single-wing system, one was a blocking back, Erny Pinckert. 
</P>
<P>
 And four were linemen: tackles Jess Hibbs and Ernie Smith, and guards Johnny 
Baker and Aaron Rosenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 And without them, you can't have a valid Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Not at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 They and 11 teammates in particular -- the 11 others who earned All-American 
or other distinctive attention in that generation -- were the true founders of 
USC athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 They were the players who, in 1925-33, during Jones' first nine years in Los 
Angeles, led the Trojans through nine big-winning seasons; who in one 
three-year stretch played a record 28 games without losing, and who played 
before crowds ranging up to 100,000 at the Coliseum and 120,000 at Chicago's 
Soldier Field. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, when the time comes for USC's alumni to expand their Hall of Fame next 
spring, they should elect a class of 20 -- starting with the nine players who 
should have made it this year and adding in the 11 who deserve to make it next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what they all did:  
</P>
<P>
 * Four helped lead USC's 1928-29 football teams to a national championship one 
season and a Rose Bowl victory the next: end Francis Tappaan, lineman Nate 
Barragar, and backs Russ Saunders and Marshall Duffield. 
</P>
<P>
 * Five others helped take USC to a pair of Rose Bowl victories as leaders of 
the 1929 and 1931 teams and to the 1931 national championship: end Garrett 
Arbelbide, linemen Baker and Stan Williamson, and backs Shaver and Pinckert. 
</P>
<P>
 * Enrolling in the early '30s, six other USC football players helped lead 
their university to two national championships and two Rose Bowl victories on 
the 1931 and '32 teams: end Ray Sparling, linemen Smith, Rosenberg and Tay 
Brown, and backs Orv Mohler and Homer Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
 * Five other key Trojans were on teams that either began or ended the 
history-turning Jones decade. The school's first two great backs, Kaer and 
Drury, started it all off in the middle '20s with linemen Hibbs and Brice 
Taylor. In 1932 and '33, when USC twice blanked Notre Dame, Warburton climaxed 
the Hall-of-Fame-decade-that-wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, a USC alumni faction voted a different group of late-comers 
into the strange new Hall-of-Fame-that-is: Jon Arnett, Mike Garrett, Frank 
Gifford, Simpson (football); Fred Lynn (baseball); Buster Crabbe (swimming); Al 
Geiberger (golf); Parry O'Brien (track and field); Bill Sharman (basketball); 
Stan Smith (tennis); Norman Topping (administration); Dyer (sportswriting); 
Jones, McKay, Marv Goux, Rod Dedeaux (special awards).  
</P>
<P>
 The historic contribution of 15 of these 16 has been to sustain their 
heritage. And for doing it well, they, along with football stars Marcus Allen, 
Grenny Lansdell and Pat Haden, deserve early Hall of Fame membership. 
</P>
<P>
 But not yet. Soon, but not yet. THEY MADE A GREAT UNIVERSITY 
</P>
<P>
 The sports fans who throughout America tuned into the earliest 
transcontinental broadcasts -- hearing about Pinckert and Arbelbide and Johnny 
Baker for the first time in the 1920s -- are mostly all gone now. 
</P>
<P>
 So are many of the millions who, in all 48 states, read all about it in their 
hometown newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the impression of excellence that USC first made on a big country nearly 
70 years ago is still there. 
</P>
<P>
 As one consequence, historians credit USC's early football teams with a proud 
achievement: putting Los Angeles on the national sports map. 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't, however, the best thing they did. Their principal achievement was 
putting USC on the national university map. 
</P>
<P>
 They built the foundation on which USC has erected a great educational 
institution that might have had trouble reaching such heights without its 
football teams -- particularly in a state crowded with so many other great 
schools, from UCLA and Caltech to Cal and Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 As John Hubbard, professor emeritus of history, formerly president of USC, 
noted in a 1980 Times interview, "a half century of success in football" has 
largely made USC what it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbard concluded that three winning coaches -- Jones, McKay and John Robinson 
-- have taken the university so far that, ironically, "USC athletics has become 
no more than a handsome auxiliary to one of the nation's fine academic 
institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Trojan football teams slumped awhile after the Hubbard era, but they seem to 
be coming back, now that Robinson has returned. 
</P>
<P>
 And under 1990s President Steven B. Sample, USC has continued to attract 
eminent new scholars as well as an envied endowment. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus in any reckoning of the American universities that for many decades have 
been best known throughout the 50 states, USC is up there with Notre Dame, 
Harvard and Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 And their football teams played a major role in bringing each to the attention 
of the nation: 
</P>
<P>
 * Harvard helped invent football. And a Harvard team later played in the Rose 
Bowl -- and won -- long before USC ever got there. 
</P>
<P>
 * For many years, football has also advertised Stanford, whose 1925 Rose Bowl 
team lost to Notre Dame's Four Horsemen six months before Howard Jones landed 
at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 * As for USC and Notre Dame, their intersectional football series has been 
America's most celebrated since Jones and Rockne. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, it wasn't baseball, obviously, that introduced USC to the 
nation. And it wasn't swimming, golf, tennis or track -- which, curiously, were 
all represented in the Trojans' first Hall of Fame class, and which have 
something else in common: Their public followings are so small that USC's 
football program must support them all. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before there was midget auto racing in Hollywood, long before Benny 
Goodman played the Palomar, long before the arrival of the Raiders or Dodgers 
or Rams -- even before UCLA -- there was USC football. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing else mattered . 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone who can read knows that. 
</P>
<P>
 For USC's alumni, what matters now is their next vote.

WORLD CUP '94; THE SOLE OF THE MATTER; TWO DISPARATE VIEWS ON THE WORLD'S MOST 
POPULAR SPORT AND ITS PLACE IN AMERICAN SOCIETY; AMERICANS DON'T SO MUCH 
DISLIKE SOCCER AS THEY ARE SIMPLY AMBIVALENT ABOUT IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The oldest and most prolific soccer franchise in the United States is 
practicing on a tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpet covers the asphalt. Wooden boards surround the baselines. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego Sockers are young and shaggy-haired and laugh easily as soccer 
balls leave their feet and clang into one of the goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Clang , because the goal is a chain-link fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, they will walk past courts still used for tennis, lock their cars and 
leave the neighborhood as prostitutes are arriving. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sockers have won 10 professional indoor soccer championships in 13 years, 
yet their British coach still fights the urge to give up. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are times I think, 'Did I do the right thing by remaining in the United 
States?' " says Ron Newman, who has pushed his sport here for 26 years. "I tell 
my friends the horror stories about soccer, and they all say, 'Why on earth do 
you stay?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Why, indeed? Despite a 20-year infusion of players, fields, leagues and knee 
socks with tassels, there is a truth in this country as it prepares to play 
host to the most important soccer event in the world: 
</P>
<P>
 We do not give a hoot about soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics show that our children play it more than they play baseball. Our 
colleges have more soccer teams than football teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet we do not watch it. Not on television, not in person and certainly not 
where the purchase of a ticket is required. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Ron Newman ever have horror stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, his Sockers averaged 11,415 fans for 16 games at the 
12,948-capacity Sports Arena. Since then, they have: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lost their longtime owner. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lost their league. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lost the roof over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in soccer, only in America, could an indoor dynasty have to practice 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
 The once-proud North American Soccer League of the 1970s has been moved inside 
and eventually whittled into the Continental Indoor Soccer League, of which the 
Sockers are members and play in front of an average of 5,500 fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have just not created enough excitement for the game here," Newman said. 
"People say, 'Why should I watch?' " 
</P>
<P>
 People say worse than that. 
</P>
<P>
 A Harris Poll conducted in February showed that only 20% of Americans realized 
that the World Cup will be held in this country this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 25% of Americans even know that the World Cup involves soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 And more than half, 53%, said they are not interested in watching any of the 
games on television. 
</P>
<P>
 And this is the most-watched sporting event on the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollsters did not ask the respondents for their reasons. But here are a few 
ideas. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WE CAN'T USE OUR HANDS? 
</P>
<P>
 For those casual observers who think the corner kick is a country-western 
dance, the game plays like a strange foreign film. 
</P>
<P>
 Players penalized for touching the ball with their hands? Players applauded 
for hitting the ball with their head? 
</P>
<P>
 Players who, upon being lightly bumped, fall to the ground in a sobbing heap? 
</P>
<P>
 "Soccer feels like it belongs to another culture," said Eric Denson, sports 
psychologist at the University of Delaware. "Baseball is our national pastime, 
everything about football is very American and basketball is our urban 
phenomenon. I don't know where soccer fits in that mix." THIS WEEK ON 
TELEVISION: 40 EPISODES OF MATLOCK, NO SOCCER. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember those sweet old days when the most commonly repeated adage in sports 
was, "May the best man win?" 
</P>
<P>
 Today, it's, "Without television, you're meat." 
</P>
<P>
 No spectator sport can survive without a television contract. If you don't 
believe that, there are United States Football League tickets to sell you. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer is without a major television contract because network executives are 
convinced nobody will watch it. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer fans claim nobody can watch it because it is seldom on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Undisputed is that in 1990, the World Cup telecasts from Italy averaged only a 
1.2 rating on the TNT cable network. That translates to 571,000 cable 
households, less than half the average ratings drawn by bowling, boxing or the 
New York Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not the ideal game for television," said Kevin O'Malley, TNT senior 
vice president for programming. "The pacing of the game, the size of the field, 
the subtleties of the game, all of that makes it difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't help that there are no home runs, touchdown catches or 
bench-clearing brawls. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a microwave popcorn culture. We don't want to wait long for action," 
said Joel Cohen, a Los Angeles human relations specialist who wrote a master's 
thesis for Boston University on the future of soccer in America. "But soccer 
takes time to develop. We don't have the attention span for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, none of those theories accounts for the real reason Americans can't 
sit and watch a 90-minute soccer games. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no timeouts. When are we going to go to the bathroom? Or the fridge? 
EXCUSE ME, BUT WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING THE LAST 90 MINUTES? 
</P>
<P>
 Arguably, the most sensuous of all English verbs in the United States is 
score.  
</P>
<P>
 You score tickets to a concert. You scored big with the boss by staying late 
to finish that project. 
</P>
<P>
 And what would teen-ager movies be without somebody bragging to somebody else 
about, well, you know. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the NFL changed rules that have been around for 75 years. Reason? To 
increase scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 People are still writing bad jokes about the 1990 World Cup in Italy. Reason? 
The teams averaged 2.2 goals a game. Combined. 
</P>
<P>
 "All Americans want is scoring, while Europeans only care about the final 
result," Newman said. "For Americans, points (are) entertainment. Europeans 
couldn't even tell you the final score . . . but they know who won." 
</P>
<P>
 It might help if, every time a soccer player scored, he didn't scream at the 
clouds and fall to his knees and act as if this was the last goal we would see 
this century. WE'D LEAP FROM WINDOW AFTER A LOSS ONLY IF PUSHED 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer's biggest asset is not its strategy or its athleticism, but its 
passion. 
</P>
<P>
 There are few press boxes in European stadiums, by request of the reporters. 
To cover a soccer game there is to sit in the stands and cover the singing, 
weeping, flag-waving and fistfighting. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't quite describe your typical Dodger fan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just watched the Knicks beat the Bulls in their final playoff game, and it 
was an intense game," said Kyle Rote Jr., the first American soccer player to 
gain renown here. "But there were not any suicides in Chicago the next day, and 
the Chicago mayor was still in office. People simply turned their attention to 
the White Sox and the Cubs." 
</P>
<P>
 In other countries, soccer is the sport. If the national team loses, there 
could be a coup. 
</P>
<P>
 Not containing the flash of other sports, soccer requires this passion to 
survive. Newman said it can be developed here only when that boy down the 
street grows up to be a pro soccer player, and the entire neighborhood becomes 
his fan. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer needs people, not cheering for a sport, but for other people. 
</P>
<P>
 "When my wife was coaching youth soccer in Dallas, there was a father who 
wouldn't stay for the games because he didn't understand them," Newman 
recalled. "But after a few weeks, when he realized he was missing a part of his 
son's life, he started staying longer and longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the end of the season, he still didn't know much about soccer, but I 
caught him fighting another parent in a ditch." INK-STAINED WRETCHES WOULD 
RATHER PICK UP A CHECK THAN WRITE ABOUT SOCCER 
</P>
<P>
 It is the soccer family's belief that opinion makers in this country hate the 
sport. They believe the media either rip it or ignore it, without ever 
understanding it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You show me a sports editor of a major newspaper in this country who likes 
soccer, and I will show you a miracle," Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon hearing this comment, George Solomon made the earth move. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like soccer," said Solomon, assistant managing editor, sports, for the 
Washington Post. "If you look back at how the NASL was covered, it was covered 
well. On a number of occasions -- the Washington Diplomats were here -- we led 
the newspaper with it. A well-conceived outdoor league would generate coverage 
and interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer fans complain that even when columnists write about their sport, they 
trash it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That really annoys me," said Glenn Dickey, longtime sports columnist of the 
San Francisco Chronicle and former soccer beat reporter. "Very few 
sportswriters understand soccer at all, but rather than make an attempt to 
learn, they just dismiss it as stupid because nobody scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a guy doesn't know about a sport, don't write about it. I don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Smizik, sports columnist for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, was recently 
embroiled in local controversy when he ripped the sport. And his son plays it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very boring. I can't get excited even at my kid's soccer game," Smizik 
said. "There is a lack of scoring. A lack of understanding about the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "Violence in sports turns me off, but it turns most Americans on . . . and 
soccer is not violent enough. It's too clean." 
</P>
<P>
 Even in Pennsylvania, one of the top soccer-playing states, Smizik is not 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 When the fledgling Major Soccer League began campaigning in Pittsburgh for $50 
ticket pledges in hopes of bringing a franchise there, a local television 
reporter offered to pay people not to buy the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under no circumstances does this guy want a soccer team in this town," Smizik 
said. IMAGINE BASKETBALL IN A COUNTRY WITH NO FULL COURTS 
</P>
<P>
 Newman remembers walking into Balboa Stadium in San Diego during renovations 
and noticing long-jump pits being put on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I rushed home and wrote the city a letter, asking them to please put the long 
jump pits in the end zones so the field could remain wide enough for soccer," 
Newman recalled. "I got a letter back from an official who wrote that he would 
not change anything because he was trying to make the field suitable for all 
sports." 
</P>
<P>
 Newman sighed and said: "But wasn't that my point?" 
</P>
<P>
 Appropriately, one of the best soccer stadiums in the country is one that has 
been deserted by a football team -- the facility at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Rare is the field built just for soccer. Fields that could attract 
professional outdoor teams are built for football. Most new recreational fields 
are built for softball. 
</P>
<P>
 For those wishing to watch good soccer, neither works. 
</P>
<P>
 Football fields are too narrow. An official football field is 53.3 yards wide. 
A proper soccer field should be at least 70 yards wide. 
</P>
<P>
 "So the soccer that many Americans see is like soccer being played in an 
alley," Newman said. "That makes it easy for the defense. Fewer goals are 
scored, leading to all the complaints about no scoring." 
</P>
<P>
 Softball fields have pitching mounds and dirt, both of which hurt soccer 
players more than other sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trend today is to just put a soccer field in the middle of softball 
fields," said Mona Nahimy, recreation specialist for the city of San Diego. 
"Many people play soccer, but many people also play softball. And baseball is 
still our national sport." THE GRANDFATHER FACTOR 
</P>
<P>
 Many children have learned about baseball from older relatives who have taken 
them to games and explained the nuances. 
</P>
<P>
 When a grandfather and his grandchild attend a soccer game -- if ever -- the 
child does the explaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is hard to spread the beauty of the sport when there are generations of 
people over 30 who do not understand it," said Rote, now a sports agent. "I 
take my son to a baseball game, I can explain about cutoff throws. The more he 
appreciates the game, the more he loves to watch it. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many parents and grandparents, that cannot happen in soccer. And it won't 
happen until today's younger soccer players grow up." 
</P>
<P>
 Rote hopes to serve as a surrogate grandfather at the Rose Bowl later this 
summer when he coaches the contestants in the Gillette Free Kick Challenge. In 
the contest, a person can win $1 million for kicking a ball into a four-foot 
space from 15 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will teach this person about kicking from the inside of the foot, and 
outside of the foot, and off the shoelaces," Rote said. "It will be a great 
chance to school someone on the nuances of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 And if the contestant is American, he will probably figure out a way to throw 
it in.

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; RATINGS ARE OFF, AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THE ANSWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ice Age cometh. 
</P>
<P>
 NBA basketball, it's . . . disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
 If these games slow down any more, everybody will be running backward. Scoring 
has fallen to 95 points a game in postseason play and is dropping every round. 
The relatively freewheeling Houston Rockets and Utah Jazz averaged 90. The 
Neanderthal New York Knicks and Indiana Pacers are at 86. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it's easy to fix. How about a shot clock? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, they already have a shot clock? 
</P>
<P>
 A league weakened by the departure of Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and Larry 
Bird is now trying to survive the Knicks and Pacers in the Eastern Conference 
finals, a series also known to lovers of the game as DOB: Death of Basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Knick Coach Pat Riley calls it "a game of force." It looks more like a game of 
mud wrestling." 
</P>
<P>
 The game of force is apparently made up of missed shots, turnovers, holding, 
elbowing, bumping, taunting, fouls, double fouls, technical fouls, double 
technical fouls, flagrant fouls and the occasional near riot. 
</P>
<P>
 Or not, depending on your perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find myself cringing a lot lately," said Dave Checketts, Knick president. 
"It's as if there are people who consider themselves keepers of the gate. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I ask, 'What is the gate?' 
</P>
<P>
 "This style, this trend, has caught on from the start of the season. I 
remember a preseason meeting of owners and general managers when we all said, 
'This is the year when some games will be played in the 60s.' . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "These guys (the Knicks) are in the Eastern Conference finals and somehow 
that's not enough. Somehow, they want a more elegantly fashioned team and they 
cannot appreciate a group with great heart and desire. . . . It's just not 
enough for some people." 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently it isn't. NBC's playoff ratings are off 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you how bad it was," said the Washington Post's Mike Wilbon, 
reporting in from Games 3 and 4 on the Eastern front. "The Indianapolis 500 was 
the highlight of my weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone knows the answer -- a closer three-point line to unclog the lane -- 
but the league is adopting the "What, me worry?" defense: It's normal, it's the 
new defensive fad, it's a cycle, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, scoring dropped 5% this season and is down 9% since 1980, so we are 
looking at a long cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, the NBA brass is as bored as everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does David Stern think of this?" someone asked a league official last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "He encourages it," said the official. "He's an insomniac." DON'T YOU HAVE A 
MOVIE TO SHOOT? 
</P>
<P>
 After years trying to civilize the Knick players, was Riley undone by the 
antics of a Knick fan? 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Miller, looking for provocation, found a beauty, scoring 25 points in 
the fourth quarter of Game 5 while carrying on a running conversation with 
filmmaker Spike Lee, even giving him the two-hands-around-the-neck choke sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, who likes to participate in his spectator sports, also provoked Scottie 
Pippen in the last series, after Pippen had dunked over Patrick Ewing and then 
stepped over him. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee wore a John Starks uniform top that night, a Brooklyn Dodger baseball 
jersey last week. 
</P>
<P>
 In honor of his big moment, Lee was saluted by his hometown papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks a Lot, Spike," said a New York Daily News headline. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spike This," said the New York Post. 
</P>
<P>
 The Madison Square Garden crowd also chanted "Cher-yl" at Miller, who has 
heard that one since he was at Riverside Poly. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Reggie's famous sister called him after his mild performances in 
Games 1 and 2 and told him to drop the Mr. Nice Guy act. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was short and sweet," Cheryl Miller said. "I said, 'Reggie, you know and I 
know that's not your style. You're not a white-hat guy. You're not the Lone 
Ranger. You're Black Bart.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him to take off the cape and get off the white horse. Everyone was 
talking about the John Starks thing last year and expecting 'Head Butt 2, The 
Sequel.' Reggie didn't want that. But the way he was playing didn't look like 
my brother. I felt compelled to call." THE FLIGHT OF THE CHUCKWAGON 
</P>
<P>
 Can this be the end of Charles Barkley? 
</P>
<P>
 When the Rockets couldn't sell out the opening game of their second-round 
series, Phoenix Sun President Jerry Colangelo bought 300 tickets for Game 2, 
raffled them off to fans back in Phoenix and flew them in on a chartered jet 
nicknamed "the Chuckwagon." 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns came from 20 behind in the fourth quarter, with Barkley getting every 
loose ball and rebound down the stretch. Hakeem Olajuwon might as well have 
been in the stands watching him. 
</P>
<P>
 By Games 6 and 7, Barkley needed shots of painkillers for a pulled groin. He 
also took anti-inflammation injections for his back, although he said that was 
OK. He had 42 points and 30 rebounds in the two games, but he was still a 
shadow of himself. 
</P>
<P>
 He now insists he will go through with his promise to retire unless a doctor 
can do something, other than surgery, for his back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone says I'm not serious, that I joke around a lot," Barkley said. "But 
those people have good backs." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Barkley leaves or not, the Suns, with six players over 30, face an 
overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
 They think they have tried to make Dan Majerle into something he is not -- a 
shooting guard -- and want to put the thunder back in Thunder Dan. Last season 
his game deteriorated into three-pointers or nothing. Once a good defender, he 
couldn't guard quicker guards as well as he did stronger forwards. 
</P>
<P>
 A.C. Green, who has a one-year termination clause, says he will go back on the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun insiders suspect Barkley is looking for a reason to leave, and here's one: 
The long knives are out for Matt Guokas at NBC. Barkley, of course, would add 
comic and terror dimensions they have never dreamed of. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley is still making the rounds of the doctors. Phoenix is holding its 
breath. FACES AND FIGURES 
</P>
<P>
 How cold is it? The record for fewest points in a playoff game has been broken 
twice (68 by the Knicks, 69 by the Pacers), plus playoff records for lowest 
scoring half (68 by the Knicks and Nets) and the quarter (23 by the Rockets and 
Jazz). . . . Another blast of Arctic air: NBA officials and the players' union 
have met twice, accomplished nothing and adjourned quickly. Stern says he's 
even willing to abandon the sacred salary cap -- if the players will agree to 
some other deal that contains costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Prognosis: There is every chance there will be no new contract by next 
season's start. After that, owners would have to decide if they want to lock 
the players out. They probably won't. If the season starts and an impasse 
continues, the players could strike the All-Star game or the playoffs. In other 
words, it's like the current baseball season. . . . For the record: Last week 
it was reported here that Olajuwon is married. He isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Let the bidding begin: Agent Ron Grinker says Danny Manning is "the Hawks' to 
lose" and is eager "to hear how the Hawks are going to look to improve their 
team." However, Grinker has told three other teams -- Phoenix, Orlando and 
Charlotte -- they are in the running. . . . Indiana's Byron Scott: "Six months 
ago I was looking for a job. People in L.A. said I was finished. Winning 
another one would be very sweet. I want this one as badly as the first one." 
</P>
<P>
 Seemingly intent on scattering that old gang of theirs, the Bulls fired 
assistant coach John Bach, architect of their widely admired defense. Coach 
Phil Jackson made no comment but two days later General Manager Jerry Krause 
announced: "It was Phil's decision and I concurred." Bull insiders say it was 
Krause's decision and Jackson concurred because he could no longer keep them 
from one another's throats. Said Horace Grant: "They showed no class. If they 
treat assistant coaches like that, just think how they treat their players. I 
will never forget what they've done. If I have anything to do with it, (Bach) 
will be in the city that I play in. This is going to change the team in a very 
big way." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley said he decided at the last minute to reactivate Anthony Mason, whom he 
had suspended for the last three games of the regular season, $42,242 worth. 
Actually, the Knicks and Mason's agent agreed on a $13,414 payroll deduction 
and Mason didn't file the grievance he surely would have won. "As far as I'm 
concerned, that's still too much," said Charles Grantham, head of the players' 
association. . . . All depends who you are: Mason was fined for complaining 
about playing time but Charles Oakley, one of Riley's most productive and 
favorite players, continues to complain about his contract. "I didn't let them 
down," Oakley said. "I think they let me down." 
</P>
<P>
 Last word on the Utah clock operator's 10-second daydream, from an NBA 
official: "You guys didn't know when we set the clock up for 10ths of seconds, 
we put in a snooze alarm."

PACERS FIGURE TO BE HISTORY; NBA PLAYOFFS: VISITING TEAM HASN'T WON A GAME 7 
SINCE 1982, BUT MILLER HOPES TO "STEAL ANOTHER ONE" FROM KNICKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Who knows what has become of that big green and yellow tractor across the 
street from Market Square Arena in Indianapolis, the one some self-deprecating 
Hoosier parked amid the pep rally of people poking fun at themselves in 
response to New Yorkers laughing at the hayseeds. 
</P>
<P>
 It was impossible to miss, not only because of the size but because of the 
sign taped to the side of the engine cover: 
</P>
<P>
 PAT RILEY'S LIMOUSINE. 
</P>
<P>
 This, according to the locals' plan, was supposed to be how Riley would ride 
out of Mayberry late Friday, his Knicks following in humiliation after having 
lost four in a row to the fourth-place team from the Central Division and being 
bounced from the NBA playoffs. No dice. Riley and his charges went back first 
class, riding the wave of a 98-91 victory that carried them to New York to make 
another stand. The chartered aircraft helped, too. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where it has taken them, to Madison Square Garden tonight for Game 7 
of the Eastern Conference finals against Indiana. The winner advances to the 
NBA finals, starting Wednesday against the Rockets in Houston. The loser goes 
home to contemplate what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 That goes for the Pacers, too, although no one could have predicted before the 
season, or even as late as January, that they would need one victory in two 
games to get to the NBA championship series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks, on the other hand, were expected to succeed the Chicago Bulls atop 
the East, probably remaining as favorites even after the Atlanta Hawks beat 
them out for the best record in the conference. It is not possible for New York 
to go beyond preseason expectations. But it is unacceptable to face being 
knocked out by losing four of the last five games, two at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we can go down there and steal another one," Pacer Reggie Miller said 
after Game 6. "It would have been nice to end it here, yeah, but we've got to 
do it the hard way. This is what the playoffs are all about. All the money is 
riding on that game." 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics say it will be harder than ever. The last time a team won a 
Game 7 on the road was in 1982, when the Philadelphia 76ers advanced with a 
victory at Boston Garden. Eighteen home teams have won since. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether that means anything in this series remains to be seen. The Pacers, 
after all, stunned New York, the team and the city, with a victory here in Game 
5, when Miller scored 25 points in the fourth quarter to lead the comeback from 
a 12-point deficit in that final period. That gave Indiana a chance to close 
out the series at Market Square Arena in an environment that was so 
playoff-crazy that several television stations covered the airport arrival of 
Knick booster Spike Lee, but New York won again. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowd is going to be raucous, our guys are going to be pumped," said 
Knick Coach Pat Riley, looking down the line to move into a second-place tie 
with John Kundla with five NBA titles, behind only Red Auerbach's nine, on the 
all-time list. "We want to get to June 8. That's what our quest has been. I 
think we have an opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Added guard Greg Anthony: "That's what we worked all year for, to get the 
home-court advantage. We kind of let ourselves down a little bit (in Game 5) 
but we have a chance at redemption." 
</P>
<P>
 They have a chance at much more. Or no more.

THE QUESTION BECOMES, TO WIT, NOW WHERE WILL WHITSITT SIT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a new development Saturday in the bizarre tale of the NBA general 
manager who won't stay away. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Whitsitt's office is now almost bare. The Seattle SuperSonics said they 
have taken out all the "business equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 When Whitsitt, the NBA executive of the year, reported to work Friday, he 
found his desk and chair. And that was it. 
</P>
<P>
 The club removed Whitsitt's telephone, computer, fax and VCR. 
</P>
<P>
 "We asked Bob to take a paid leave of absence," Bill Ackerley said Saturday in 
a statement. "Bob chose to continue to come into the office despite our 
requests not to. 
</P>
<P>
 "We removed company-owned business equipment from Bob Whitsitt's business 
office. We felt it was necessary to take this step. We didn't feel it was 
appropriate for Bob to be using company assets when he has been placed on a 
paid administrative leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Ackerley, son of club owner Barry Ackerley, is president and chief executive 
officer of Ackerley Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitsitt, president and general manager of the club for eight years, has asked 
out of the final three years of his five-year, $500,000-a-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the SuperSonics put Whitsitt on paid administrative leave and asked 
him not to come into the office until his contract issue was settled. Reporting 
to the office Wednesday through Friday, Whitsitt insisted he was in charge of 
the SuperSonics' draft June 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The club said Whitsitt, 38, won't have anything to do with the draft and that 
Coach George Karl will be in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 A source close to Whitsitt said Saturday that he planned to report to work 
again Monday despite his bare office. "Bob will keep going to work because he 
doesn't want to breach his contract," the source said. "Bob does not have a job 
offer. He wants out because the pressure from Barry Ackerley the last two years 
has been enormous. Barry's late-night phone calls are part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitsitt, who is also a close friend of Portland Trail Blazer owner Paul 
Allen, could not be reached for comment Saturday.

TITANS' WAGNER REWARDED FOR NOT THROWING IN THE TOWEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He was cut from his high school team twice, barely made it on the junior 
varsity team as a junior, then was kicked off the varsity as a senior in his 
hometown of Plano, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, little more than two years later, Matt Wagner is scheduled to pitch in 
the College World Series today in a game his Cal State Fullerton team must win 
to keep its hopes alive for a national championship after a loss to Georgia 
Tech in the tournament opener. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wagner, it has been a remarkable rise in only one season, and he hopes he 
can stay on track today. He has gone from the bottom of the pitching list when 
the season began to a 12-1 record and the honor of being selected Big West 
pitcher of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I could do this if I had the chance, and Fullerton gave it to me," 
Wagner said Saturday as he awaited today's 4:36 (PDT) game against Louisiana 
State in Rosenblatt Stadium. "I couldn't ask for a better situation to develop 
as a pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner was a catcher when he started playing in high school, but he didn't 
make the team his freshman or sophomore years. "The coach told me he was going 
to cut me again my junior year as a catcher, but they had only one other 
pitcher on the JV team and he asked me if I wanted to try that. I finally made 
the varsity as pitcher my senior year, but then I got kicked off." 
</P>
<P>
 A drinking incident involving him and some other students got Wagner booted 
from the team. "I don't think the coach liked me, though, and I think he was 
just looking for a reason to kick me off," Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner still hadn't overwhelmed anyone with his pitching at that point. He was 
only 1-1 at the time after pitching in five games. He got another chance to try 
it at Abilene Christian last year, but he wasn't happy there and transferred to 
Fullerton. Coach Augie Garrido and his pitching coach George Horton gave him a 
chance to walk on. 
</P>
<P>
 They also told him he would have to get in better shape. Wagner was 6 feet 5, 
240 pounds at the time, and he decided to go on a diet. He eliminated red meat 
and fast foods. "I was living on tuna fish, but I lost 33 pounds in a month and 
a half in late October and early November." He also started running regularly 
as part of a preseason conditioning program. 
</P>
<P>
 He started the season in the bullpen, but after a series of strong relief 
performances, he moved into the starting rotation in early March and has been 
there since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I pitched well all season," Wagner said. "I think the only game I had 
a bad outing in was against Oklahoma State in the regional last week," Wagner 
said. "I thought too much about what I had to do for the team. I wanted to do 
so well, and I wasn't concentrating on the way I should have been on every 
pitch. I pitched two innings of relief the next night, and that helped me get 
my confidence back." 
</P>
<P>
 Horton said Wagner was in part the victim of the plate umpire's tight strike 
zone in his last start at the regional. "It was a tough environment, too, at 
Oklahoma State and he didn't handle it as well as he could have," Horton said. 
"Our season is on the line now, though, I feel good about handing him the 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner said he feels good about everything, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I've found is that the coaches here are incredible," Wagner said. 
"They've really helped me develop." 
</P>
<P>
 He also points to his catcher, Bret Hemphill, as a key factor in his success 
this season. "I don't think people realize just how good a catcher he really 
is," Wagner said. "As far as I'm concerned, he's the best catcher in the 
country. He knows me, and he can tell when I'm not straight in my head. He 
comes out and gets me back on track." 
</P>
<P>
 Hemphill said Wagner sometimes will let his emotions get out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 "Matt is very competitive, and you have to like that in a pitcher," Hemphill 
said. "I just remind him to focus on what he's doing and forget about the 
things going on around him." 
</P>
<P>
 Hemphill also is confident Wagner will pitch well against Louisiana State. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a very good fastball, and the reason he's so successful is that he has 
really good control," Hemphill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner also has worked to develop a split-finger fastball, which has been a 
factor in his emergence as a top college pitcher. "That split-finger pitch he 
throws can really be nasty when he's on," Hemphill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner will have plenty of personal support for today's game. His parents are 
divorced, but they will be at the game with friends and relatives. "Between my 
ex-wife and me, we've bought about 34 tickets," Wagner's father, John, said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner is confident the Titans can bounce back, the way they did from the 
losers' bracket in the regional. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody said it was going to be easy," Wagner said.

COLLEGE WORLD SERIES NOTEBOOK / LON EUBANKS; CAL STATE FULLERTON FAMILIAR WITH 
IMPRESSIVE TALE OF THE TIGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton resumes play in the College World Series at 4:36 (PDT) 
today against a Louisiana State team that is known for its power hitting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers have 87 home runs this season, more than the 1991 and 1993 teams 
that won national championships. LSU had 14 homers in its four games in the 
NCAA regional on its home field. 
</P>
<P>
 The two top Tiger hitters, shortstop Russ Johnson and second baseman Todd 
Walker, lead the way. Walker has 18 home runs and Johnson has 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were impressive against Florida State the other night, even though they 
lost the game, 6-3," said George Horton, the Fullerton associate head coach who 
handles scouting for Coach Augie Garrido. "They've got a lot of tradition going 
for them, but we do, too." 
</P>
<P>
 LSU has won the two national championships in the last three years under Coach 
Skip Bertman. The Titans also won national titles under Garrido in 1979 and 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans are scheduled to start Matt Wagner (12-1, 2.40 earned-run average) 
in the game. LSU is expected to start one of two sophomores, either Brett 
Laxton (4-4) or Jeremy Tyson (9-3). Laxton had a complete-game shutout against 
Wichita State in last year's national championship game, but he was troubled by 
a strained shoulder for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido is considering three alternatives in today's game for center fielder 
Dante Powell, who is still slowed by a hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could continue to play him both ways, use him as the designated hitter, or 
not start him if we think he's not ready," Garrido said. "Regardless of whether 
Dante plays or not in this game, he's important to the team because of his 
leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido says he won't make the decision until just before game time, depending 
on Powell's status at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't as far along as we hoped he would be on Friday," Titan trainer 
Chris Mumaw said. "We couldn't afford to test his leg at full speed until then, 
but we knew when he hit that first ground ball it was still a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell is still being treated for the injury, but Mumaw declined to speculate 
on whether he will be improved by game time. "We'll just have to wait and see 
now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, the two first-round losers play the early game in the College World 
Series today, but that game was moved to a later time to accommodate ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
 ESPN is carrying the Stanley Cup hockey playoffs live. The move allows the 
winners' bracket game between Georgia Tech and Florida State to be carried 
live. The Fullerton-LSU game will be broadcast on radio on KMNY-AM (1600).

TRACK AND FIELD / NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS; UCLA SPRINTER REED EXPELLED FROM MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA sprinter Marcus Reed was disqualified from the meet Saturday and Arkansas 
distance runner David Welsh also was tossed out of the NCAA Outdoor Track and 
Field Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisiana State won its eighth consecutive women's title with 83 points, to 43 
for second-place Texas and 42 for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas was the men's champion with 83 points, to 45 for Texas El Paso. USC 
was 10th with 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed was disqualified for violating what officials called the honest effort 
rule. The ruling came after he false-started in Friday night's 200-meter 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 An appeal by UCLA Coach Bob Larsen was rejected, and the penalty was expulsion 
from the meet, though Reed had qualified for Saturday night's 100 final. 
</P>
<P>
 Welsh, who finished fourth in Friday night's 10,000 meters, was disqualified 
for unsportsmanlike conduct after hitting Penn State's Mark Wimmer in the head. 
The incident occurred after Welsh was jostled by Wimmer early in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas Coach John McDonnell, who sent Welsh home Saturday, said Wimmer 
provoked the incident, but he didn't condone his runner's action. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got to learn not to do those things," McDonnell said of Welsh. 
</P>
<P>
 In the competition, Holli Hyche's bid to make track and field history by 
winning eight consecutive titles was shattered by lightly regarded Merlene 
Frazer of Texas in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyche, of Indiana State, had won the 55- and 200-meter titles at each of the 
past two NCAA indoor championships, the outdoor 100 and 200 last year and 100 
this year in 11.23 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazer bolted past her with about 60 meters left and won the 200-meter finals 
in a wind-aided 22.49 seconds.

COLLEGE WORLD SERIES; ARIZONA STATE BEATS NO. 1 MIAMI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Home runs by Todd Cady and Damon Lembi supported the shutout pitching of Billy 
Neal and Noah Peery as Arizona State beat top-seeded Miami, 4-0, in the opening 
round of the College World Series on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State (44-16) will play Oklahoma, a 5-4 winner over Auburn, in 
Monday's second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami (48-13) will face Auburn in an elimination game. 
</P>
<P>
 Neal (9-4) gave the eighth-seeded Sun Devils seven strong innings, scattering 
seven hits. Peery came in after a leadoff single in the seventh and collected 
his 12th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurricane relief ace Danny Graves tore a knee ligament in the ninth inning, 
trying to make a pivot in the grass on a run-down play. He is not expected to 
be available the rest of the tournament. Graves had 21 saves, one short of the 
NCAA season record of 22 by Cal State Fullerton's Scott Wright in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Cady and Lembi homered in the fourth inning. Cady hit his 10th of the year 
with one on against Hurricane starter Eric Morgan (10-5), and one out later 
Lembi added his fifth homer of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State's Billy McGonigle made a dazzling defensive play after singles 
by Mike Metcalfe and Bruce Thompson put runners at first and third with none 
out in the sixth inning. Danny Buxbaum lined to left, and McGonigle threw 
Metcalfe out at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma 5, Auburn 4 -- The Sooners (47-17) got two hits and two RBIs from Ray 
Minor, who led an 11-hit attack against the Tigers (44-20). 
</P>
<P>
 The Sooners touched Auburn starter John Powell for two runs in the second, 
ending Powell's postseason scoreless streak at 18 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell (5-4), the NCAA's career strikeout leader, got No. 600 in the third 
inning. He was lifted in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Sooner starter Mark Redman (13-3) struck out 11 and gave up five hits until 
Robert Lewis led off the eighth with a homer. Jay Waggoner followed with a 
single and Bucky Buckles relieved. 
</P>
<P>
 Buckles gave up hits to Shawn McNally and Brandon Moore to score another run 
and Mike Killimett's groundout scored McNally to get the Tigers within one. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma's Chip Glass led off the eighth with an inside-the-park homer for a 
two-run lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Buckles then struggled again in the ninth, allowing a run before collecting 
his 13th save.

SNOW'S BACK WITH NEW GAME PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The young man sitting on the dugout steps flashed a familiar smile. It was 
good to be back, J.T. Snow said Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 He had just flown in from Colorado Springs, Colo., landing at noon and leaving 
only enough time at his Corona del Mar home to grab a sandwich before bolting 
for Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't wait to get here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Older, wiser, maybe even a bit more cynical, Snow made his return to the 
Angels, determined to adhere to a new directive from Manager Marcel Lachemann. 
In a brief meeting before the Angels played the Milwaukee Brewers, Lachemann 
welcomed Snow with some advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me, 'We're not looking for you to do anything great, just help the 
team,' " Snow said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no dramatics from Snow on his first night back. He made all the 
routine plays at first base, beat out a slow roller down the third-base line 
for his first hit of 1994 and later lined a single to right in a fairly mundane 
return from triple-A Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first at-bat, he hit a towering drive toward the right-field fence, 
bringing the crowd of 23,952 to the brink of hysteria. But Brewer right fielder 
Turner Ward caught the ball on the warning track. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to become a better ballplayer," Snow said of his 53-game stay in 
Vancouver. "From the first day in Vancouver I told myself, 'Let's make the best 
of it.' I wasn't going to hang my head. Every day I took the field I tried to 
do something positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth, when they told me (he was coming up), I didn't expect 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver is nice, Snow said, if you're into hockey. On the night the 
Vancouver Canucks clinched a berth in the Stanley Cup finals, only about 100 
die-hard baseball fans attended the Canadians' game. 
</P>
<P>
 A promotion had been rumored for weeks, but Snow said he stopped listening. 
When the Angels fired Buck Rodgers May 17, Snow was shocked. In hindsight, it 
might have opened at least one door for Snow. Rodgers wasn't a big Snow 
supporter, repeatedly questioning Snow's mental toughness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just went about my business," Snow said. "My family is from here and they 
read the papers. There's a natural information pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm glad to be back. I'm looking at it as a fresh start. It's good to be 
here because this division is wide open. I know I can help this team a little 
bit. That drove me when I was down there (at Vancouver), knowing this division 
is so wide open. Maybe we can go to the playoffs."

 Midfielder John Harkes, who arrived recently from England but has yet to play 
a game with the U.S. team, said at halftime he was worried that the U.S. 
backline was appearing somewhat vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way we are standing flat," he said, "I fear that one ball over the top 
will get us." 
</P>
<P>
 Harkes, who said he didn't expect any problems fitting in with the team after 
a few more practices, was asked what had been the most surprising thing he had 
noticed about the U.S. team upon his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alexi Lalas' beard," he said. BILL DWYRE

 Argentina became the first major soccer nation to visit Croatia, playing the 
host team to a 0-0 tie at Zagreb in the Argentines' last game before the World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 About 38,000, including Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, watched in the rain 
as both teams squandered scoring chances. 
</P>
<P>
 At Brussels, Josip Weber scored five goals in his international debut, leading 
Belgium to a 9-0 rout of Zambia, the nation's largest margin of victory since 
it began playing internationally in 1904. 
</P>
<P>
 At Pomona, N.J., Saudi Arabia took a 3-0 lead in goals by Majed Mohammed in 
the ninth minute, Saeed Al Owairan in the 20th minute and Fahd Al bishi in the 
29th minute, then held on to defeat Trinidad and Tobago, 3-2. Angus Eve scored 
twice for the losers.

WORLD CUP '94; DEFENSE IN SOCCER 
</P>

 TACTICAL STRATEGY 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive play changed forever in the 1974 World Cup when Franz Beckenbauer 
revolutionized the sweeper position, using it as a point from which to launch 
attacks in leading Germany to the title. Since then, defensive formations have 
varied widely from the conservative to the daring. In the World Cup, the U.S. 
national team might use as many as five defenders in an attempt to keep games 
close. The German Plan 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 German team will defend using a sweeper, marking backs, and 
midfielders. The Germans will patiently build their attacks from the back. They 
will try to crowd their opponents in the midfield with everyone, including the 
attackers, helping out on defense. A. Sweeper: Can launch attacks, once ball 
has been won. B. Marking backs: Will play aggressively, man to man. When the 
opportunity presents itself, they can and will attack. C. Outside midfielders: 
Will drop down to play entire flanks, acting as outside backs. D. Central 
midfielder: Covers the most ground, initiating attacks when possible. However, 
he also has to fill in the gaps left by the offensive midfielders when they 
move up on offense. E. Offensive Midfielders: Will drop down to defense if 
needed. Corner Kick 
</P>
<P>
 Most teams play a man-to-man defense against a corner kick, with the goalie 
making sure everyone is covered before the kick is taken, especially attackers 
racing into the box for a header. Free Kick 
</P>
<P>
 Against a direct kick near its goal, a defense will set up a wall 10 yards 
from the ball, or closer if the referee is not paying attention, to block the 
shooter's angle. The goalkeeper is responsible for positioning the wall so it 
blocks a section of the goal. He then covers the other part. 
</P>
<P>
 A. WALL DEFENDERS: A wall is usually made up of four to six players, who stand 
tightly together and use their hands to protect vulnerable regions of the body. 
</P>
<P>
 B. CHARGING THE WALL: Often, an opposing player will try to sneak into the 
wall to give the shooter a path to the goal by ducking. GLOSSARY 
</P>
<P>
 * Back pass -- A pass made back to his own goalkeeper by a defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stopper -- A defensive player who primarily covers the area in front of the 
goal. Often the last line of defense. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sweeper -- A defender who has free reign to roam the field as he wishes, but 
is mostly found in defense. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wall -- A tightly grouped line of defenders positioned between the ball and 
the goal on a direct kick. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dead ball -- As in basketball and football, when play is stopped and the 
ball is not moving. All free kicks are supposed to be taken when the ball is 
stationary. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fifty-fifty ball -- A loose ball that an attacking player and a defender 
have an equal chance to control. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clear -- To kick or head the ball away from the goalmouth. A good clear is a 
ball passed to a teammate to start an attack; a bad clear merely gets the ball 
out of danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Jersey: The goalkeeper's jersey must always be a different color to 
distinguish him from the other players. TACKLING 
</P>
<P>
 A defensive move that uses the feet to strip an opponent of the ball. Here are 
some of the basic soccer tackling techniques: 
</P>
<P>
 * A tackle should not be attempted if the opponent is out of range. This gives 
the opponent a chance to sidestep the tackler. 
</P>
<P>
 * The tackler should move in closer and patiently wait for the moment he could 
put all his weight behind winning the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 * In tackling from behind, the first contact must be with the ball and not an 
opponent's legs. Otherwise it could cause the defenders a free kick. The same 
can be said of tacklers challenging from the side. 
</P>
<P>
 * In trying to win a bouncing ball, a player cannot raise his foot with the 
cleats of his shoes threatening an opponent. He will be called for dangerous 
play. However, if that same player were to twist his foot to bring the ball 
down and away from his opponent, the chances of his being called for a foul 
decreases considerably.

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; IT'S CRISIS AGAIN AS EIGHTH WORK STOPPAGE LOOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As always, it is difficult to know what or whom to believe in the owners' 
approach to collective bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
 It is harder yet to comprehend their tactics in the current talks or to accept 
their claims of unity on the salary cap and revenue sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 This much is certain: 
</P>
<P>
 Having voted on Dec. 12, 1992, to reopen negotiations a year early, ostensibly 
to remove the crisis atmosphere that always surrounds the talks, they have now 
blown that concept and created another crisis by failing to make even one 
definitive proposal on the major economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The clock is ticking. The owners and players are on a collision course again, 
heading for their eighth work stoppage in the eight negotiations since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 The union, left without a substantive proposal and fearing that the owners 
will declare an impasse after the season and unilaterally impose a salary-cap 
system that would destroy free agency and arbitration, is expected to set a 
strike date, either at a meeting of its executive board in Chicago on June 16 
or at a meeting in Pittsburgh on July 11, the day before the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unlikely that the union will wipe out the All-Star game, but a strike 
could begin as early as July 18, some believe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not interested in striking, but we may have to," Gene Orza, the union's 
associate general counsel, reiterated from New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just one more example of the owners believing it's in their best 
interest to negotiate in a crisis atmosphere. As long as there is a crisis 
going on, they believe that they can test the strength of the players. Their 
attitude seems to be, 'Let's force them to strike and see what happens.' 
Consider the history. They've come away from every stoppage saying, 'If we had 
just waited a little longer, we might have gotten what we wanted.' " 
</P>
<P>
 What the owners want is a system of revenue sharing among themselves, but only 
if it's linked to a salary cap that the union views as restrictive and 
unnecessary in an industry producing annual revenue of $1.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is, how badly do the owners want it? The big markets hesitantly 
but finally agreed to revenue sharing at a January owners' meeting in Florida. 
They have yet to tie it to a salary-cap proposal that can be taken to the union 
but are expected to do that during a three-day meeting starting Tuesday in 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal will be given to the union on June 14 and revealed publicly at a 
subsequent news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief negotiator, said that in his judgment "the 
owners are more unified than ever," but the perception of many others is that 
sharp divisions remain between the big and small markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The perception is that the big markets, including the Dodgers, Boston Red Sox, 
Toronto Blue Jays and New York Mets and Yankees, could live with the status quo 
and are reluctant to force a prolonged work stoppage at a time when they are 
initiating new pennant and playoff formats and trying to get their new TV 
partnership -- that makes its debut with the All-Star game -- off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch might finally forge his salary-cap proposal in Cincinnati, but it 
might not be easy. In the meantime, he blames the union for the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last negotiations (1990), the clubs came to the table with a 
definitive proposal and the union said, 'Why didn't we work this out together? 
Why have you made up your mind already?' " Ravitch said. "So this time we came 
ready to discuss the issues and work on them jointly and the union said, 
'Where's your proposal?' That meant we had to go back and formulate one." 
</P>
<P>
 Orza laughed and called that revisionist history worthy of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we said the last time is what we said this time," he said. "We told them 
that if they're truly interested in a partnership, let us in on the ground 
floor, involve us in planning and policy from the start, but it never happens, 
and it's too late to suggest that a partnership is viable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, their idea of a partnership is to say, 'This is the way the world 
should look and we need a salary cap to implement it.' They want the players to 
help them implement a system that restricts the market and economic growth. 
Some partnership." 
</P>
<P>
 So what's new? 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he was amazed by the 18-month wait for a proposal, Orza said it was 
consistent with the owners' history, with their longstanding hope of dividing 
the union and their belief that it will only happen in a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't consider it puzzling or amazing," he said. "I consider it scary." 
DRAFT FOLIO 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Pittsburgh Pirates apparently knew what they were doing when they 
drafted high school pitchers Dustin Hermanson in the 39th round and Paul Wilson 
in the 57th in 1991. Unfortunately for the Pirates, they signed neither, and 
Hermanson and Wilson proved that they, too, knew what they were doing by going 
on to Kent State and Florida State, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was the first player chosen in Thursday's draft, by the New York Mets, 
and Hermanson was the third, by the San Diego Padres. They will probably get 
signing bonuses of $900,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other time the Mets had a No. 1 was in 1966, when they selected 
catcher Steve Chilcott. The Oakland Athletics, drafting second, then picked an 
Arizona State outfielder named Reggie Jackson. Chilcott never played in the 
majors, but the Mets are confident Wilson will. 
</P>
<P>
 They see Wilson -- 144 strikeouts in 125 innings this year -- joining Bobby 
Jones, Bill Palsiper and Chris Roberts, another Florida State product, in a 
1996 rotation rebuilt in the country hardball image of Tom Seaver, Nolan Ryan, 
Jerry Koosman and Jon Matlack. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be very disappointed if three of our five starters are not home-grown by 
1996," club Vice President Gerry Hunsicker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida State pitching coach Jamey Shoup said it shouldn't take that long in 
Wilson's case. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's so far advanced that he'd be wasting his time going to the minors," 
Shoup said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Dodgers will deny it, but their decision to make catcher Paul Konerko 
of Chaparral High in Scottsdale, Ariz., their No. 1 pick seems to indicate they 
are disappointed with the development of catcher Ryan Luzinski, a sandwich pick 
between the first and second rounds in 1992, and may intend to move either 
Konerko or Mike Piazza to another position at some point, depending on 
Konerko's development. 
</P>
<P>
 They clearly don't need another catcher in the immediate future or they would 
have selected Georgia Tech's Jason Varitek, Baseball America's college player 
of the year. Varitek, who could be in the Seattle Mariners' lineup by '96 or 
sooner, was the 14th player chosen. Konerko was the 13th. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't compare them," Dodger scouting director Terry Reynolds said. 
"Varitek is four years older. One's a man and one's a boy in terms of their 
baseball experience and development. However, I believe Paul is ahead of where 
Varitek was when he came out of high school as a third baseman-catcher." STRAW 
POLL 
</P>
<P>
 The Boston Red Sox's acknowledged interest in Darryl Strawberry, Ron Gant and 
Larry Walker has waned some with the acquisition of outfielder Wes Chamberlain, 
whom they got from the Philadelphia Phillies for pitcher Paul Quantrill and 
outfielder Billy Hatcher. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies needed Quantrill to bolster their injury-riddled pitching staff 
and had wearied of Chamberlain's platoon complaints and unreliability. 
Chamberlain missed a team meeting two days before the trade and arrived only an 
hour before the season opener, among other sins. The Red Sox, however, had gone 
11-12 in 23 games before the trade, were using Tim Naehring -- seven for his 
last 47 through Thursday -- in the cleanup spot and had Andre Dawson, John 
Valentin and Scott Fletcher on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 They were desperate to strengthen the offense and liked Chamberlain's 
part-time numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's 28, coming up to his prime," General Manager Dan Duquette said. "If he 
can get 500 at-bats, we think we have a very, very good player. We also didn't 
think (Quantrill) could ever step up and be a dominant reliever, and we didn't 
think he had enough pitches to be a starter." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco Giants, meanwhile, continue to leave the door open for 
Strawberry and Gant, talking informally to agent Eric Goldschmidt, who 
represents both. The Giants stranded 34 runners in the three-game sweep by the 
Atlanta Braves this week and finally called up first baseman J.R. Phillips, 
despite his 57 strikeouts in 191 at-bats at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Bob Quinn said, "If the club doesn't start stepping up the 
pace, this is just the beginning. How does the song go -- I've only just begun. 
I'm not going to sit back and idly watch this club, with all this talent, fall 
six or seven games back. I'm not going to sit and watch Rome burn." 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Dusty Baker has known Strawberry since he was at Crenshaw High and 
thinks his recovery and availability are worth watching. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of clubs are going to be interested," he said. "He's only 31. The 
question is, does he have his life in order? It's a matter of when." 
</P>
<P>
 The same can be said of the Giants' inconsistent offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the missed opportunities, Baker said, "It wears on your heart. You feel 
like your dog died. Maybe everyone in San Francisco should light a candle for 
us." LIGHTS OUT 
</P>
<P>
 There was some truth to the right-left spin that the Braves tried to put on 
the Deion Sanders-Roberto Kelly trade, but there was also truth to the belief 
that Neon was starting to wear thin, missing meetings and schedules and 
generally marching to his own beat. General Manager John Schuerholz talked to 
him about it and wrote to him about it but wasn't sure how much was getting 
through and apparently didn't like the way it was headed. Schuerholz was 
particularly concerned because he had customized center field for Sanders by 
allowing Otis Nixon to leave as a free agent and had given Sanders a 
three-year, $11-million contract. The clubhouse reaction to Sanders' departure 
said a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tom Glavine, of the events Sanders skipped: "I'd be lying if I said there 
wasn't a certain amount of 'Why do we have to be here and he doesn't?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Tarasco added, "I wouldn't say there are players that didn't like Deion. 
They could only take so much of him sometimes."

<P>
 The greatest challenge in Marcel Lachemann's young managerial career may not 
be winning games, but simply trying to keep everyone happy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have decided that J.T. Snow will be their first baseman until 
further notice.Jim Edmonds will be the starting left fielder. And as soon as 
Eduardo Perez is comfortable at third base, he'll be playing there and Damion 
Easley will be moved to second. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like that, left fielder Dwight Smith finds himself on the trading block, 
left fielder Bo Jackson is on the bench and, as soon as Perez returns, second 
basemen Harold Reynolds and Rex Hudler will be there with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's mind-boggling," Smith said, "but this is a business. I'm a veteran, so 
maybe they think it shouldn't bother me. But I'm human, too, and I have to 
handle it as a professional." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Easley, who was put on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to May 30 because 
of a strained right shoulder, will be replaced by Mark Dalesandro, who is being 
called up from Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Mark Langston, who left Friday's start because of a tight left elbow, 
underwent precautionary X-rays that proved negative. He was found to have a 
tired arm, and is scheduled to start Wednesday. . . . General Manager Bill 
Bavasi asked pitcher John Farrell if he would consider returning to triple-A 
Vancouver when starter Brian Anderson is activated Tuesday. Farrell has yet to 
make a decision. BOB NIGHTENGALE

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; JOHNSON TELLS REDS: DON'T TAKE SO LONG

 Manager Davey Johnson will take winning, but he has had enough of doing it the 
hard way. The way the Cincinnati Reds are going, he's a candidate for another 
antacid commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson lectured his players after they scored six eighth-inning runs Saturday 
night to beat the New York Mets, 8-5. It was their 15th come-from-behind 
victory of the season, and at least one too many for Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a few words for them in the clubhouse," an irritated Johnson said. "I 
said, 'If you're going to do it late, you can do it early.' We go out too laid 
back, like we're waiting for something to happen. I can't figure it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're not agitated, I am. This is a good club. It works hard. It just 
doesn't have the enthusiasm early as we do late." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Thompson and Joe Orsulak each drove in two runs to help New York build a 
5-2 lead in the eighth inning. But a throwing error by reliever Josias 
Manzanillo on a double-play ball set up the rally that included a two-run 
double by Eddie Taubensee, who had only two RBIs all season. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only the fourth victory in 14 games for the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 2, San Francisco 1 -- Ray Lankford homered on Mike Jackson's first 
pitch in the ninth inning to give the Cardinals a victory at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson (3-2) pitched a hitless eighth before surrendering Lankford's 12th 
homer, which sent the Giants to their fifth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants have dropped 12 of their last 16 and have scored only 17 runs in 
their last eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 5, Philadelphia 1 -- Doug Drabek pitched a five-hitter for his eighth 
victory in his last nine decisions, leading the Astros at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Drabek (8-2), who moved within one victory of his 1993 total, struck out three 
and walked three in his fourth complete game. The Astros won for the seventh 
time in their last nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 4, San Diego 3 -- Jeff Conine singled home Chuck Carr with one out in 
the 10th inning as the Marlins won at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Conine had tripled in the ninth and scored the tying run on a single by Greg 
Colbrunn, who had three RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 10th, Carr led off with a single and advanced to second on Jerry 
Browne's infield hit. Matias Carrillo flied out before Conine singled off 
former Marlin reliever Trevor Hoffman (2-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Yorkis Perez (1-0) got two outs for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 6, Chicago 1 -- The Expos got home runs from Larry Walker and Wil 
Cordero after Marquis Grissom led off the game with a homer in dealing the Cubs 
their fifth consecutive loss in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker also had his NL-leading 26th double and scored three runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Martinez (4-3) gave up one run and seven hits in seven innings for 
Montreal. He struck out six and walked two. Mel Rojas pitched the final 1 2/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 4, Colorado 3 -- Kevin Young hit a bases-loaded triple in the sixth 
inning at Denver, helping the Pirates snap a season-high, five-game losing 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory stopped Colorado's winning streak at four games. 
</P>
<P>
 Young was hitting .200 when he drove in three runs with a shot high off the 
center-field wall.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; INDIANS STREAK WITH MATURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The young Cleveland Indians knew what they needed to gain respectability. They 
needed to get older, so they acquired Eddie Murray, Jack Morris and Tony Pena, 
who have more than 46 years of major league experience combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday in Oakland, Cleveland won its seventh in a row, 8-2, over the 
Athletics when Murray hit his 450th home run and drove in four runs, Morris 
(5-4) pitched seven strong innings in his fourth victory in a row and Pena, on 
his 37th birthday, walked and scored twice while giving regular catcher Sandy 
Alomar the day off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should all have a party tonight. We're not even supposed to be here," 
Morris, 39, said. "I think we're all thankful to have a uniform. We do have a 
lot of pride and we understand what it takes to put a major league uniform on." 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians are 15-4 since May 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 2, Toronto 0 -- Randy Johnson became the first Mariner pitcher to 
throw three consecutive shutouts as he struck out a season-high 15 in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson (7-3) won his fifth game in a row, allowing six hits and increasing 
his scoreless-inning streak to 27. The club record for consecutive scoreless 
innings is 34 1/3 by Mark Langston in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 4, New York 3 -- Terry Shumpert hit two home runs and drove in 
three runs in the Royals' victory at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Shumpert began the season with six major league homers in 564 at-bats. He has 
six this season in 65 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Henderson also homered for Kansas City. Jim Leyritz hit a two-run homer 
in the ninth inning for the Yankees, who have lost five of six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 10, Boston 4 -- Jose Canseco, Will Clark and Rusty Greer had four hits 
apiece as the Rangers won at Boston. Canseco and Greer hit two-run homers and 
Clark had four singles as Texas had 19 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Canseco has reached base safely 10 times in a row with three homers, two 
doubles, two singles, two walks and a hit by pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Rogers (7-3) won for the fifth consecutive time, though he gave up two 
home runs to Boston's Mo Vaughn. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 7, Baltimore 1 -- Jack McDowell (3-7) allowed five hits in seven 
innings and rookie Norberto Martin hit his first homer -- a grand slam -- to 
lift the White Sox at Baltimore.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; BRAVES' KELLY SAYS HE'S NO DEION SANDERS

 In his debut with the Braves at home, Roberto Kelly was hoping to get a warm 
welcome, though Atlanta fans reacted with opposition to the trade that sent 
Deion Sanders to Cincinnati. But the fans seemed to forget Sanders quickly 
Friday night, when Kelly scored once, doubled in two runs and made a couple of 
flashy plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not here to copy what Deion did. Deion is Deion," Kelly said. "I'm not a 
flashy type of player. I'm not here to replace Deion, I'm here to play center 
field. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not outspoken, I just do what I have to do. I don't think people have to 
worry about me being too loud." 
</P>
<P>

 Brett Butler's mother, Betty Butler, had the upper part of a lung removed 
Thursday after doctors found a malignant tumor. Butler said his mother is 
waiting on results of tests on two lymph nodes. . . . Delino DeShields, in Los 
Angeles after exploratory surgery Thursday to remove a foreign body from his 
middle left finger, will be reexamined in a few days and probably will join the 
team in Florida. . . . The Braves may have found a way for John Smoltz to miss 
only one start during his eight-game suspension for his part in a 
bench-clearing brawl on May 14, when he hit New York Met John Cangelosi with a 
pitch. Smoltz, whose hearing is set for June 23 in New York, is being urged by 
the club to drop his appeal after his start on June 20. Past suspensions have 
started immediately after dropped appeals. If National League President Leonard 
Coleman follows that, Smoltz's suspension would end a day before his scheduled 
June 30 start. However, Coleman said he intended Smoltz to miss two starts.

 The Texas Rangers agreed to terms with pitcher Reid Ryan, the son of Nolan 
Ryan, and two other players they chose earlier last week in the amateur draft. 
Ryan, a right-hander from Texas Christian, was the club's 17th-round pick. . . 
. Former Atlanta outfielder Ron Gant has been examined by doctors from the 
Cincinnati Reds and met with Jim Bowden, the club's general manager, but has 
not been offered a contract. Gant was cut by the Braves after breaking his leg 
in an off-season motorcycle accident.

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; NAMES AND NUMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 * PLAYING D: Despite the absence of Will Clark and Robby Thompson, the San 
Francisco Giants have maintained their reputation as baseball's best defensive 
team. They lead the majors in fielding and have made only 19 errors in 55 
games, a pace that projects to 56 for the season. The major league record for 
fewest errors in a 162-game schedule is 84 by the Minnesota Twins in 1988. The 
National League mark of 94 was set by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1992. The 
Giants had a franchise-record streak of 10 consecutive errorless games snapped 
a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * FEELING HURT: Third baseman Chris Sabo has recovered from the disk problem 
that put him on the disabled list, but he's dealing with wounded pride now. 
Sabo has asked the Baltimore Orioles to trade him, having lost his position to 
Leo Gomez while injured. Gomez endured an injury-marred 1993 season himself, 
which prompted the Orioles to sign Sabo as a free agent, but he took advantage 
of Sabo's injury to regain his 1992 form -- 17 homers and 64 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 * CUBS' VOID: Greg Maddux, 9-2 for the Atlanta Braves this season, is 29-12 
since the Chicago Cubs allowed him to leave as a free agent after the 1992 
season. Mike Morgan and Jose Guzman are a combined 24-34 as the alleged 1-2 
replacements for Maddux in the Chicago rotation. Morgan is 0-7 this year, and 
Guzman, with more than 2 1/2 years left on the four-year, $14-million contract 
he signed with Chicago before last season, is 2-2 and out for the year because 
of shoulder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 * ANNIVERSARY WALTZ: How did Andy Van Slyke celebrate his 1,000th game as a 
Pittsburgh Pirate? He struck out four times Tuesday night and watched the San 
Diego Padres score 13 runs in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not what major league baseball is all about," said Van Slyke, who 
called it his second-worst game. As the Louisville third baseman in 1983, he 
made four errors in six innings the night after his wedding.  
</P>
<P>
 "I remember somebody asking me after that game where my new wife was, and I 
said, 'She left. She was much too embarrassed.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * PATHETICS: Here's part of the reason the Oakland Athletics have a 16-38 
record: They have already used 34 players, 15 of them pitchers. They have tried 
eight first basemen, seven second baseman and eight starting pitchers.

SOUTHERN SECTION BASEBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS; LIVERNOIS BANISHES GHOSTS BY HELPING 
LA QUINTA WIN; DIVISION III: PITCHER, WHO TOOK LOSS IN LAST YEAR'S TITLE GAME, 
HOLDS ON AS AZTECS BEAT WEST TORRANCE, 3-1, FOR CHAMPIONSHIP.

<P>
 Those pesky demons tried to creep into Jim Livernois' head again; swirling 
around him as they did in those final, desperate moments on the mound last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time, Livernois promised himself he would shut them out. And he did 
-- with some help. 
</P>
<P>
 Livernois survived a scare in the top of the seventh inning, holding on to 
pitch La Quinta to its first Southern Section Division III title with a 3-1 
victory over West Torrance in front of 2,400 Saturday night at Cal State 
Fullerton's Titan Field. 
</P>
<P>
 West Torrance (25-7) loaded the bases against Livernois in the top of the 
seventh inning with two outs. But La Quinta center fielder Anibal Delacruz 
ended the game with a running catch of a line drive hit by Derek Nicholson to 
center. Delacruz caught the ball just in front of the 400-foot sign, sparking 
La Quinta's celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Livernois entered the seventh inning with a 2-1 lead against 
Tustin in the Division III title game. But Tustin rallied against Livernois for 
a 3-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 That was then. This is now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't let myself think about anything from last year," Livernois said. "I 
knew I had to stay focused to get that out. Anibal made a great catch. It was 
just super." 
</P>
<P>
 That description sums up Livernois' career at La Quinta, too. 
</P>
<P>
 With his complete-game victory, Livernois -- The Times Orange County player of 
the year last season -- ends his season 15-3. He finished his three-year 
varsity career with 39 victories, one short of the Orange County record held by 
Jim Peterson of Sonora (70-73). 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody ever had a doubt Jim would do it," catcher Joe Linck said. "We had the 
momentum and we had Jim. He showed a lot of character out there." 
</P>
<P>
 With that type of support from his teammates, it's no wonder La Quinta Coach 
Dave Demarest had no intention of removing Livernois when things got tight this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing you have to understand about Jimmy is that he's been in five or six 
games like this during his career," said Demarest, whose team ends the season 
28-3. "He might not have won all of them, but he knows what they're about. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were sticking with him, do or die." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs enjoyed a two-run lead throughout the game, and they could have had 
more. La Quinta could not capitalize on three errors committed by the Warriors, 
including two in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta went ahead, 3-1, in the bottom of the third when Delacruz walked and 
stole second with one out. He came home when the next batter, Linck, singled to 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs opened the scoring in the bottom of the second. Joel London hit a 
two-out double to left-center that drove in Livernois and Sean Carlson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that was pretty important at the time because it put us ahead early 
and gave us confidence," London said. "But, as it turned out, we really needed 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 West Torrance cut the lead to 2-1 in the top of the third. Nicholson's 
sacrifice fly to center with one out drove in Dustin Ciscel from third. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciscel opened the inning by hitting a line drive to left-center field. Aztec 
left fielder Charlie Tuggle dived for the ball, but it fell just below his 
glove and rolled to the outfield fence. 
</P>
<P>
 It was La Quinta's third appearance in a title game. This is the second time 
West Torrance has played for a championship.

SANDKAMP'S HEROICS CAME TOO EARLY TO HELP EAGLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 J.J. Sandkamp could only sit and suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 The pitcher Calvary Chapel had leaned on could only offer moral support in 
Saturday's Southern Section Division V championship game. Sandkamp had to watch 
the Eagles lose to Sierra Madre Maranatha, 6-2, at Blair Field. 
</P>
<P>
 "This hurts," said Sandkamp, a senior. "It's no fun taking a loss like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting here had been nothing but fun and games for Sandkamp and the Eagles. 
He had, after all, won the team's four playoff games, including a 10-inning 
marathon against defending champion Big Bear in Tuesday's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 But under Southern Section rules, a pitcher is limited to 30 outs per week. 
Sandkamp hit the ceiling in his 3-2 victory over Big Bear. 
</P>
<P>
 So he was limited to being the team's designated hitter Saturday, leaving him 
in a perfect spot to watch the Eagles' season end on a down note. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Herr started, but didn't get out of the first inning. Herr (7-5) walked 
the first four batters, then hit the fifth. He went only two-thirds of an 
inning, giving up five runs on one hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Cody Hamilton relieved and pitched well. He went 6 1/3 innings, allowing only 
one run. But he was no Sandkamp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it would have mattered if I pitched," Sandkamp said. "We didn't 
really hit their guy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles got only two hits off Jon Crabb. Still, with Sandkamp on the mound, 
Calvary Chapel's two unearned runs might have stood up. 
</P>
<P>
 "J.J. loves to pitch in games like this," Coach Joe Walters said. "He's so 
mentally tough. He just shuts teams down." 
</P>
<P>
 And has all season. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandkamp was 10-2 with a 1.27 earned-run average and 80 strikeouts in 88 1/3 
innings. His run through the playoffs was extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 He threw a five-hit shutout against top-seeded North Hills L.A. Baptist in the 
second round. Sandkamp struck out nine in the 4-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandkamp then beat fourth-seeded Big Bear. He struck out nine and allowed only 
two unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a great playoff, I can be happy about that," Sandkamp said. "I was 
fortunate that the Lord gave me a strong arm." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles were fortunate Sandkamp was at Calvary Chapel. He spent his first 
two years at Fountain Valley, then transferred. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley won the Division I title Friday night with a 3-2 victory over 
Lakewood. Sandkamp sat out last season, then led the Eagles to the title game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no regrets about coming here," Sandkamp said. "We did our best." 
</P>
<P>
 But with Sandkamp on the mound, the Eagles' best is always a little better.

CALVARY CHAPEL CAN'T OVERCOME MARANATHA'S BIG FIRST INNING; DIVISION V: SIERRA 
MADRE TEAM SCORES FIVE RUNS TO OPEN GAME, AND BEATS EAGLES, 6-2, FOR THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP. IT IS FIRST TITLE-GAME APPEARANCE FOR BOTH TEAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Calvary Chapel had the kind of half-inning that causes players and coaches to 
shake their heads and wonder how so much could go so wrong so soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Eagles had their first at-bat, they were down five runs and went on 
to lose to Sierra Madre Maranatha, 6-2, in the Southern Section Division V 
title game Saturday at Blair Field in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first title-game appearance for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel, the third-place team from the Olympic League, finishes 20-9. 
Among the Eagles' four victories in the playoffs were upsets over top-seeded 
North Hills L.A. Baptist, 4-0, in the second round and No. 4 Big Bear, 3-2, in 
10 innings Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Maranatha finished second in the Alpha League and beat No. 3 Pasadena Poly, 
8-1, in the quarterfinals and then No. 2 Phelan Serrano, 4-2, in the semifinal 
round Tuesday. The Minutemen end the season 21-4. 
</P>
<P>
 All the excitement of getting there for Calvary Chapel was quickly lost amid 
the horror that was the top of the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, Calvary Chapel starter Matt Herr (7-5) struggled to throw strikes. 
He walked the first four batters, including David Mack on four pitches, to 
force in the first run. 
</P>
<P>
 Herr started with another ball to the fifth batter in the lineup, Nathan 
Covey, then hit him to make it, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, all Calvary Chapel Coach Joe Walters could hope was that Herr 
would settle down. J.J. Sandkamp, the Eagles' ace, had already used his 10 
innings for the week in the 3-2 victory over Big Bear. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Hegarty followed Covey with a two-run single to center. Herr walked two 
more, including leadoff hitter Monty Curtis, to force in the fifth run. 
</P>
<P>
 Then senior Cody Hamilton replaced Herr and got the final out of the inning on 
a groundout. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton worked 6 1/3 innings, giving up four hits, an earned run, with three 
walks and three strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to lose like that," Walters said. "Basically, we gave them the 
game at the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Maranatha pitcher Jon Crabb had no problems finding the strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Crabb pitched a two-hitter with one strikeout and no walks. Both runs he gave 
up were unearned. 
</P>
<P>
 "That helped me so much," Crabb said of taking the mound with a five-run lead. 
"Because all I had to do was just throw strikes and the defense made the 
plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Crabb was in trouble only twice and each time it was because of the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel's Ryan Elliott reached base on an error with one out in the 
sixth. Ryan Blood flied out for the second out, bringing up Joe Jones. Jones 
started the game hitting .526. 
</P>
<P>
 He lined a single to right that led to two errors and a run. Blood had planned 
on stopping at second but went to third when the throw from right fielder Covey 
hit the fence behind third. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott came home when catcher Mack couldn't handle the throw from third 
baseman Hegarty. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones continued to third and the Calvary fans finally had something to cheer 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rally ended when Alex Okland grounded out on the next pitch to end the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel scored its other run in the second. Chance King reached second 
on a throwing error and scored on Gabe Gerhardt's single up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the ultimate," Maranatha Coach Alan Karg said. "We had hoped for a 
big first inning to really put the pressure on (Calvary Chapel)."

STATE HIGH SCHOOL TRACK AND FIELD CHAMPIONSHIPS; LOCAL PAIR DON'T NEED TOP 
EFFORTS TO BE CHAMPIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 For a few fleeting moments, Jeremy Fischer of Camarillo High and Dolores 
Tuimoloau of Channel Islands were disappointed with their performances Saturday 
in the state track and field championships before a crowd of 9,318 at Cerritos 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they realized they were champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer slapped his hands together in frustration after missing his third 
attempt at 7 feet 2 inches in the high jump, but when Rich Pitchford of Charter 
Oak missed his third attempt, Fischer was declared the winner because he 
cleared 7-0 on his first attempt while it took Pitchford three tries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like 20 pounds has been taken off my back," Fischer said. "I was 
hoping to go higher, but I felt like I had a lot of pressure on me coming into 
this meet. . . . I guess I'm starting to realize that I can't expect to (be 
attempting) 7-4 3/4 or 7-5 1/2 every meet." 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, the yearly national outdoor leader at 7-4, cleared 6-4 on his first 
attempt, but he fell to third when it took him two attempts to get over 6-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitchford maintained his lead by clearing 6-9 on his first attempt, 6-10 on 
his second and 6-11 on his first, but after passing those three heights, the 
Wisconsin-bound Fischer moved into first by popping over 7-0 on his first 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he had a little bit of a letdown when (Arthur Lloyd of Rialto 
Eisenhower) went out at 6-8," Camarillo Coach Dennis Riedmiller said. "I think 
he knew that Pitchford was close to his top height at 7 feet, so when he made 
that height on his first attempt, he knew he had a great chance at winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, second behind Jeff Nadeau of Monroe in last year's state 
championships, is the second Camarillo athlete to win a state title. Eric 
Reynolds won the 3,200 meters in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had two major goals at the start of the season," Riedmiller said. "The 
first was to earn a college scholarship, which we did, and the second was to 
win State. Everything else is just icing on the cake." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuimoloau's 46-10 effort in the shotput was well short of her personal best of 
49-2, but she said becoming Channel Islands' first state champion was a "dream 
come true." 
</P>
<P>
 She also finished eighth in the discus with a throw of 137-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I was disappointed that I didn't hit 50 feet," said Tuimoloau, who 
posted a mark of 49-0 1/2 in Friday's preliminaries. "But then I said, 'Oh 
well. I didn't get it, but I did get first place and you can't top that in the 
state meet." 
</P>
<P>
 After fouling on her first attempt, Tuimoloau took the lead in the second 
round with a put of 45-10 1/4. Her efforts of 45-9 1/4, 45-1 and 46-10 in the 
next three rounds gave her the best four marks of the competition. Peka Laulu 
of Nogales placed second at 44-11 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Muir and Oakland Skyline won the boys' and girls' team titles, each with 
36-point totals. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was Muir's first since 1990. Skyline's was its first ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hart boys, powered by Jason Medearis and Brett Strahan, finished fifth 
with 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Medearis struggled to a fourth-place finish in the 110-meter high hurdles with 
a wind-aided time of 14.23 seconds before bouncing back with a second-place 
effort of 37.38 seconds in the 300 intermediates. 
</P>
<P>
 Strahan ran 4 minutes 9.98 seconds -- the second-fastest time of his career -- 
to place fourth in the 1,600 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 In other events, Antonio Arce of Palmdale, Cathy Prater of Agoura, Ramsey Jay 
of Ventura and Mike Wenz of Canyon each produced personal bests and 
region-leading marks in their events. 
</P>
<P>
 Arce ran 9:03.19 to finish second in the 3,200 behind San Diego's Mebrathom 
Keflezighi (8:58.11). It was the third meet in a row that the Falcon junior 
lowered his personal best, which was 9:25.68 three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Prater had to stutter-step at three of the eight hurdles in the 300 lows, but 
still finished second in 43.62 seconds with Buena sophomore Stacy Hebert sixth 
in 44.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Prater's time moved her to sixth on the all-time region list. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a great technical race for me," Prater said. "But I'm happy. It's 
a (personal record) and I finished second." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay and Wenz recorded personal bests for the second day in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay finished fourth in the 400 in 47.49 seconds, with Andre DeSaussure of Taft 
-- last year's runner-up -- sixth in 47.70. 
</P>
<P>
 Wenz surged from eighth to fifth in the final straightaway of the 800 meters 
to record a time of 1:53.20. 
</P>
<P>
 Esa Sallinen of Burroughs finished fourth in the pole vault (15-10) and Danny 
Haag of Granada Hills did likewise in the long jump (wind-aided 23-4 3/4). 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Kim Mortensen of Thousand Oaks and senior Gabriela Rodriguez of 
Oxnard finished fifth and sixth in the girls' 3,200 with times of 10:55.38 and 
10:55.45. Chaminade freshman Liz Giltner placed sixth in the high jump at 5-7.

STATE HIGH SCHOOL TRACK AND FIELD CHAMPIONSHIPS; CHASE FOULS OUT IN LONG JUMP, 
BOUNCES BACK FOR 2ND IN TRIPLE JUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 He didn't win the long jump or the triple jump, but Jamaal Chase of Quartz 
Hill High bounced back in the state track and field championships at Cerritos 
College on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase entered the long jump finals with the top personal best (24 feet 2 1/4 
inches) among the nine competitors in the field, but he fouled on each of his 
three attempts and finished last without a mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase said he was in a state of shock for five or 10 minutes after the third 
foul, but he rebounded with a personal best of 49-11 to place second in the 
triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of hard to come back because I didn't think I had fouled on my 
first jump in the long jump and neither did my coach," Chase said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But I realized that whether I did or not, they said I did and that was all 
that mattered." 
</P>
<P>
 Chase, who posted a mark of 22-11 in the long jump preliminaries Friday, 
unloaded a jump in the mid-24-foot range on his first attempt, but he was 
called for a foul. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that he needed to be among the top seven competitors after the first 
three rounds to get another three jumps, Chase moved the start of his approach 
back four or five inches to compensate for a tail wind, but fouled anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those last two jumps were supposed to be safe jumps," Chase said. "But the 
way the wind was picking up and slowing down made it real hard to judge your 
steps on the runway. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd start out with the wind behind you and slow down a little, but then it 
would die down and you'd have a tendency to speed up." 
</P>
<P>
 The triple jump started about an hour after the long jump and Chase used the 
interlude to converse with Quartz Hill Coach Don Crimin, who told his protege: 
"Forget about what happened in the long jump and get them back in the triple 
jump." 
</P>
<P>
 Chase took the advice to heart and bounded 49-11 in the first round. He added 
a wind-aided jump of 49-10 in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 With fatigue setting in, he went 48-5 3/4 in the third round and 47-8 3/4 in 
the fourth before fouling his last two jumps. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Chase's 49-11 effort left him seven inches behind winner Von Ware of 
Vista Rancho Buena Vista, it was long enough to advance him to third on the 
all-time region list. More impressively, it came after his disastrous 
performance in the long jump.

TAFT PRINCIPAL OUTRAGED AFTER BEING STARR-CROSSED; RECRUITING: SCHOOL PROBE 
REVEALS VIOLATIONS BY TOREADOR FOOTBALL COACH, WHOSE FATE WILL BE DETERMINED 
THIS WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Taft High Principal Ron Berz, reacting angrily to rules violations committed 
by football Coach Troy Starr, said Saturday that the coach's often stormy 
tenure could come to an end later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 After completing an internal inquiry that determined Starr had committed 
recruiting violations, Berz said he was "disappointed and embarrassed" and said 
the 32-year-old Starr could lose his coaching position depending on the outcome 
of a midweek meeting between the pair. 
</P>
<P>
 Berz said he expects to meet with Starr Tuesday or Wednesday and characterized 
the conference as "the first formal step toward possible disciplinary action." 
Berz said he expects the meeting to be "very, very intense and thorough." 
</P>
<P>
 Starr refused to comment Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft last month began investigating charges that undue influence violations 
had been committed by Starr and last week reported its findings to the City 
Section, which placed the football program on one year's probation. Berz has 
not ruled out taking the next step -- firing the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not only concerned about this one incident, but ones I might not be aware 
of," Berz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr, who in two years at Taft has compiled a record of 19-7, has previously 
ruffled feathers: 
</P>
<P>
 When Starr took over at Taft three years ago, two prominent players from the 
San Fernando High attendance area enrolled at Taft. Starr previously had served 
as an assistant at San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 The players, Jerry Brown and DaShon Polk, are two-time All-City Section 
selections and will be heavily recruited seniors in the fall. Former City 
Commissioner Hal Harkness spoke with Taft administrators soon after Brown and 
Polk enrolled to ensure that Starr's talent "pipeline" had been capped. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Taft drew fire from the coaching staffs at Cleveland and Reseda 
for running up scores. In the final moments of a 39-13 victory over Reseda, 
Starr screamed an expletive at Taft administrator Tom Abraham, who attempted to 
dissuade the coach from ordering an onside kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda Coach Joel Schaeffer was so incensed that he called for Starr's 
resignation. Berz admonished Starr, who apologized to the Reseda players -- but 
not to Schaeffer. 
</P>
<P>
 Berz did little to defend the recent actions of Starr, who hasn't made many 
friends in the coaching community. 
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of message does (running up the score) send to the players?" Berz 
said Saturday. "All of this is the exact opposite of what we're all about at 
Taft." 
</P>
<P>
 The undue influence violations were uncovered almost by accident. Berz said he 
received an anonymous letter last month that detailed illegal contact between 
Starr and a junior high student from Sherman Oaks, Dante Clay. The letter 
stated that Starr escorted Clay on a weekend tour of the Taft campus and that 
the player was given a team T-shirt and cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Contact between a coach and player from another school is against state rules. 
After receiving the letter, Berz directed Taft athletic administrators to 
investigate and the charges proved true. 
</P>
<P>
 Berz said he was told by City officials that Clay, a running back who will be 
a sophomore in the fall, may also be subject to sanctions, which could result 
in a loss of athletic eligibility. Under the City sanctions, any violations 
committed by Taft in the next year could result in forfeitures or increased 
sanctions. Starr also will not be allowed on school grounds during weekends 
without approval from Taft administrators, Berz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The punitive actions taken against Taft are the first for a City Section 
school since the state's open enrollment policy took effect last month. Berz 
said Taft coaches in all sports were given "extensive and detailed" verbal and 
written instruction regarding the new rules, which allow students to attend 
district schools outside their enrollment area. 
</P>
<P>
 Berz said that Starr was not as forthcoming as he would have liked during the 
school's investigation. "Let me put it this way: We had to do the 
investigating," Berz said. "I want to see him come clean (in our meeting)." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Starr is retained or not, Berz made it clear that he has grown weary 
of problems related to the football program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hired him," Berz said of Starr. "My judgment and credibility are on the 
line, too."

ONCE AGAIN, PARACLETE IS SECOND BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paraclete High softball Coach Margaret Neill has been here before. Fact is, 
that's what frustrates her most. 
</P>
<P>
 Neill and the Spirits made their fifth appearance in a Southern Section 
championship game Saturday -- and for the fifth time came away with the 
runner-up plaque instead of the first-place trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm gonna make a coffee table out of these plaques," joked Neill, after 
Cerritos Valley Christian defeated Paraclete, 5-1, in the Division V 
championship game at Mayfair Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Neill, who has guided the Spirits for 15 seasons, will remember her latest 
title-game loss as the most frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this one more than any of the others, because I really thought we'd 
win (this time)," Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Susie Schoales and the Crusaders quickly changed her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoales (16-2), a sophomore left-hander, threw a one-hitter, struck out seven 
and had two hits in three at-bats, including a two-run single in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos Valley Christian put pressure on senior right-hander Jamie Johnston 
(18-6) throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crusaders (24-3-1) scored all the runs they needed in the second inning on 
a two-out, bases-loaded double by Angela Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson ripped a full-count pitch into center field where it barely eluded 
the glove of Sandy Holm, who was stretched out trying to make a waist-high grab 
on the run. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nine times out of 10 she catches that ball," Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paraclete closed to 3-1 in the third when Alyson Martin scored on Ashley 
Gayer's single -- the only Spirit hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Paraclete (24-6), winner of 16 consecutive High Desert League titles, 
threatened again in the sixth when Gayer drew a walk to lead off the inning.  
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne Bass followed with a bunt, which was fielded by third baseman 
Robinson, who threw out Gayer at second on a play in which Erin Fluck appeared 
to have slid her foot over the bag before she had the ball.  
</P>
<P>
 Later, with two out and runners at first and second, Schoales struck out 
Kristal Nessa to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crusaders added two runs in the seventh on a bases-loaded single by 
Schoales. 
</P>
<P>
 For Gayer, who has signed a letter of intent with Indiana, it was a 
disappointing loss that ended a successful season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't really seem like it was us out there," Gayer said. "We had some 
spectacular plays, but we didn't make some of the routine plays. 
</P>
<P>
 But, it's all part of the game I guess."

STATE TRACK AND FIELD CHAMPIONSHIP; ORANGE'S MARTINEZ ENDS HIS PREP CAREER 
QUICKLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jaime Martinez closed out his high school career Saturday with one of his best 
personal performances in the 3,200 meters at the State track and field 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his time of 9 minutes 6.94 seconds was impressive for the Orange 
senior, it earned him only a fifth-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough. I had a couple of fast laps," Martinez said, "but that is all I 
had for today." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez began the race with the pack, but broke into the lead at the end of 
the second lap. He kept the lead until the halfway mark, where he fell back 
into second behind the state's best distance runner, San Diego High's Mebrathom 
Keflezighi. From there, he fell farther back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to keep pace with him (Keflezighi)," Martinez said. "I just kept 
pushing, but it wasn't enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Keflezighi, who also won the 1,600, outdistanced the field, finishing in 
8:58.11. Martinez has beaten Keflezighi only once, last year at the Canyon 
Regionals. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is definitely one of the best," Martinez said. "But I have to race at 
Golden West next and the guys get faster as the season goes on." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coach Lanny Carter wanted Martinez to keep up with Keflezighi in hopes 
of catching him on the final laps, but as Keflezighi pulled away from the pack, 
Martinez fell farther back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very proud of him," Carter said. "He went out to win, but the pace he 
tried to keep may have cost him a second-place finish. I think he was nervous 
before the start of the race." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who won the Earl Engman Scholarship Fund last week at the Masters 
Meet, also was voted Orange High School's athlete of the year and will compete 
at Azusa Pacific next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to win a national championship," Martinez said. "Anything is 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 In his career at Orange, Martinez has picked up quite a following. Kids from 
the neighborhood and surrounding schools come to watch him race and to get his 
autograph. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never had a youngster like him," Carter said. "I wouldn't trade him 
for anything."

STATE TRACK AND FIELD CHAMPIONSHIP; KIERULFF REPEATS FRESHMAN FEAT TO WIN HIGH 
JUMP TITLE; COUNTY ATHLETES: ESPERANZA JUNIOR CLEARS 5-10 TO WIN. FOOTHILL'S 
OETTINGER WINS LONG JUMP. NEWPORT HARBOR'S TIFT SECOND IN SHOTPUT.

<P>
 The road back was long and hard, but Kristy Kierulff finally found her way to 
another State high jump title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Esperanza junior won the competition at Cerritos College, where she had 
taken the crown as a freshman in 1992. For both titles, she cleared 5 feet 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Her defense of that title was anything but illustrious though, as Kierulff 
found that a regimen of volleyball in the fall and basketball in the winter 
fatigued her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year wasn't real good," the Empire League champion said. 'I was just 
hoping to get to the (State) prelims and get another shot at (State)." 
</P>
<P>
 After clearing her opening height of 5-4 on her third attempt Friday night, 
things looked dismal for Kierulff, but she rebounded and qualified for the 
final in the seventh position, jumping, 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "She almost didn't even get there, so we have got to be pretty happy," 
Esperanza head Coach Al Britt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's finals brought only three misses, all at 5-11, one-quarter of an 
inch higher than her personal best. 
</P>
<P>
 The clean slate earned Kierulff the State championship, as two other jumpers, 
defending champion Tracye Lawyer of Carpinteria Cate and Jamilla Churchill of 
Oakland Bishop O'Dowd, cleared the height, but had numerous misses in the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The day turned out to be just as prosperous for Foothill junior Tara 
Oettinger, who handled the long-jump field to garner her biggest victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The county champion in four individual events last April saved her best effort 
for the fourth round, jumping a personal best of 19-7 1/2 to hold off 
Bakersfield's Laren Parker, who jumped 19-6 1/2 on her last effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't even thinking about a State championship before this year," said 
Oettinger, who advanced only to the section finals in the event a year ago. She 
is Foothill's first girl State champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't really surprised because I've done it in practice before," Oettinger 
said about the winning jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza's distance-running combination of Courtney Pugmire (5:01.74) and 
Carrie Caulkins (5:02.05) finished only one spot apart, fourth and fifth 
respectively, despite taking different routes to the 1,600-meter final. 
</P>
<P>
 Pugmire won the county title at 1,500, then aced the field in the Empire 
League meet before winning the section Division II race and finishing fifth in 
the Masters Meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Caulkins, on the other hand, was the county and league runner-up, missed one 
of the nine automatic Masters Meet qualifying spots, but was given another 
chance after some athletes who had qualified in the long jump opted to compete 
in other events. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a respiratory problem this year and a mental problem because of it," 
Caulkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor thrower Gina Heads capped her prep career by capturing two 
third-place finishes in the shotput and discus. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior threw 44-8 3/4 in the shot to begin her afternoon, then returned to 
throw a personal best 146-1 on the final toss of her high school career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sort of down after the shot, so that last throw really made my day," 
said Heads, a Stanford-bound senior. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison senior Julie Koudelka ended not only her prep career, but her track 
career with a fourth-place finish in the 800, in 2:13.57. 
</P>
<P>
 Koudelka, an all-county soccer selection for the Chargers, will play soccer at 
UCLA in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor senior Wade Tift finished second in the shotput (58-8 1/4) and 
Saddleback senior Mel Lete earned a sixth-place finish in the 300 intermediate 
hurdles (37.88).

DOUBLING UP; WHEN DARYABIGI TWINS GET ON, CHATSWORTH'S OFFENSE SIZZLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What, them worry? 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Chatsworth High baseball players know they have to face El Camino Real's 
Randy Wolf -- who seems to inch closer to mythical prep status with every 
playoff game he pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 They are well aware that Wolf got the save for the Conquistadores in last 
year's 7-6 title-game victory against the Chancellors, and that he has allowed 
only two earned runs in 33 playoff innings the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chatsworth will show up Monday at Dodger Stadium for a rematch of last 
season's City Section 4-A championship game anyway -- without blindfolds and 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good pitcher, but we're not going to be afraid of him," Chatsworth 
shortstop Bryan LaCour said. "We'll be real confident up there. He's going to 
be tougher than other pitchers, but he's not going to scare us." 
</P>
<P>
 Said center fielder Ray Daryabigi: "We just think of him as the same pitcher 
we always face. Nothing different." 
</P>
<P>
 A necessary perspective on any opponent, but for Chatsworth, one that may not 
be mere bravado. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northwest Valley Conference champion Chancellors (28-4) have defeated El 
Camino Real (22-7) twice in three games, including a 4-3 victory May 10 in 
which Wolf pitched. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth has a team batting average of .342 and has so many hard-hitting 
offensive standouts -- like the Stanford-bound LaCour (.490, 41 RBIs, 17 stolen 
bases), Brandon Murphy (.365, 32 RBIs) and Tony Montiel (.337, 35 RBIs) -- that 
you can't tell them apart without a program. 
</P>
<P>
 Literally, in one case. 
</P>
<P>
 To wit: Twins Ray and Rod Daryabigi have been identically excellent for 
Chatsworth this season, and could be the decisive factor in scoring runs 
against Wolf. In the May 10 victory over Wolf, each twin scored twice, 
accounting for all of the team's runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think getting them on base is the key to our offense," LaCour said. "When I 
get my RBIs, it's either Rod or Ray. If they get on, I get RBIs. If they don't 
get on, me, Murph and Montiel probably aren't going to get RBIs." 
</P>
<P>
 There are a lot of happy hitters in the middle of the Chatsworth lineup, 
thanks to the Daryabigis, who bat in the top spots of the order. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod, the leadoff batter, is hitting .429 and Ray is hitting .381. They 
routinely get on base -- Rod has a .504 on-base percentage, Ray's is .478 -- 
and have combined to score 74 runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They go unnoticed by a lot of people, but not by us," Coach Tom Meusborn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Which Daryabigi is which is a different story. "I kind of guess and hope I get 
it right," Meusborn joked. "I've got a 50-50 shot." 
</P>
<P>
 "You can tell," LaCour said as he sat next to the twins in the bleachers at 
the Chatsworth field Saturday. "They look alike in ways, but they wear their 
hats differently." 
</P>
<P>
 Rod pointed to his hat. "Mine's lower." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray countered: "Mine's higher." 
</P>
<P>
 A more telltale characteristic: "It helps when they put their gloves on," 
Meusborn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray is a left-hander; Rod is a right-hander. Ray, the center fielder, wears 
No. 24; Rod, the second baseman, wears No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Another difference: Ray excelled more quickly than his brother.  
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Ray played left field and batted .311. Rod hovered just above the 
.200 mark.  
</P>
<P>
 But last summer Rod adopted a new, more open stance and surprised even himself 
with his improved hitting. "I knew I'd come up a little this year, but not this 
much, doubling my numbers from last year," Rod said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray also was a pleasant surprise -- on the mound.  
</P>
<P>
 Last season's No. 2 starter, Harry Kenoi, has not pitched this year because of 
shoulder problems.  
</P>
<P>
 Ray picked up the slack. He has a record of 6-0 with a 2.17 earned-run 
average. Ray won't get the starting nod opposite Wolf, however. He will patrol 
the outfield and Jim DeBiase, Chatsworth's ace, will start the title game, 
which begins at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 DeBiase defeated Wolf in the May 10 meeting and has impressive credentials: a 
10-1 record and a 2.27 ERA. Wolf's credentials, though, border on legendary. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior left-hander has a record of 11-3 and an ERA of 1.09 coming off a 
season in which he was selected City 4-A player of the year. He is on the short 
list for the same award this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In four playoff starts over the past two seasons, he has four complete-game 
victories -- including a no-hitter, a one-hitter, a three-hitter and a 
five-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf's latest feat: He entered Friday's semifinal against Kennedy with the 
bases loaded and nobody out in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 After surrendering a walk, he got a strikeout and a double play to end the 
inning. He went on to earn the save. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kennedy catcher Kevin Serr: "When he's on the mound, the mood changes. I 
think people lose confidence in their heads." 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth players believe they are exceptions. "I think our team is up for 
the challenge against Wolf again," Ray Daryabigi said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Chatsworth is to prevent a repeat of last year and win its first City title 
since 1990, he needs to be right.

<P>
 Mike Kirby, the defending Sprint Car Racing Assn. champion, won his second 
main event and his second trophy dash Saturday at Ventura Raceway on a night 
when three track records fell. 
</P>
<P>
 The 29-year-old Lomita resident took more than a second off the three-lap 
record in the trophy dash, finishing in 36.18 seconds.He then won a decisive 
victory in the 30-lap feature. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Shuman, who set a single-lap qualifying record of 11.803 seconds, held the 
previous three-lap record of 37.41. Gary Howard of Rancho Cucamonga held the 
qualifying mark at 12.006. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby inherited the lead on the sixth lap of the main event, after hometown 
favorite Cory Kruseman hit the first-turn wall while being challenged by Kirby. 
</P>
<P>
 Rip Williams of Yorba Linda, who established a 10-lap record of 2:01.7 while 
winning the first heat race, finished second. Jerry Meyer of Chino was third. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuman dropped out on Lap 22 while running third. He finished 14 overall.

SIGMAN SPRINTS AWAY IN SAUGUS MAIN EVENT

<P>
 Gary Sigman of Carson made short work of a short field of cars, coasting to an 
easy victory in the 40-lap Sportsman main event Saturday night at Saugus 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting third in an 11-car field, Sigman, the 1992 Sportsman points champion, 
moved into the lead on the third lap before pulling away for his first feature 
victory in seven starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Daniels of San Bernardino was a distant second, followed closely by Sean 
Woodside of Saugus and Craig Rayburn of Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 30-lap Grand American Modified feature race, three-time defending 
champion Dave Phipps capitalized on the misfortunes of several cars early in 
the race and won his third main event in four starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Thad Friday of Northridge finished second, with Dave Blankenship of Reseda and 
Gary Nazaroff of Covina third and fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Kelley of Arleta set the fastest Pro Stock qualifying time of the night 
and went on to win the 25-lap oval main event. 
</P>
<P>
 Points leader Scott Dinger of Simi Valley was a close second, followed by 
Sherman Oaks resident Richard Ocheltree. 
</P>
<P>
 The race was stalled by five caution flags and a restart caused by a nine-car 
pileup on the opening lap.

STATE TRACK AND FIELD CHAMPIONSHIPS; SPRINTER FALTERS; MUIR WINS TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All-American sprinter Bryan Howard of Moreno Valley Canyon Springs High 
figured all he needed was a good start in his bid to break the State track and 
field meet record in the 100 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 Such anticipation proved detrimental, however, as Howard jumped the gun in 
Saturday's final and was disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
 The State meet crowd of 10,000 at Cerritos College booed loudly as a meet 
official picked up Howard's starting block and told him to leave the track. 
</P>
<P>
 "The starter just held us too long in the blocks," said Howard, the defending 
State champion in the 100, who entered the final with the nation's fastest prep 
time this season in 10.32 seconds. "When you hold runners that long, someone is 
bound to jump. I didn't think I was the first to go, so I wasn't happy at all 
about the call." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard's absence opened the door for Pat Johnson of Redlands, a football 
player-turned-sprinter who gained national prominence earlier this season after 
several impressive races. He won going away in 10.43, far off the State record 
of 10.30 set by Riley Washington of Chula Vista Southwest in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't let Bryan's false start bother me," said Johnson, who will continue 
his football and track career at Oregon. "Everyone was so edgy at the start, I 
knew someone would jump. I just stayed still and tried to keep focused." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, a junior, had a chance for redemption an hour later in the 200. 
Although he got the quick start he was looking for earlier, Howard ran out of 
gas down the stretch and was edged at the tape by Johnson, 21.01 to 21.14. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I woke up on the wrong side of the bed today," said Howard, who also 
finished second in the 200 at the State meet last year. "I was still upset 
about the 100 and just ran a stupid race. I went out too hard and didn't have 
enough at the end." 
</P>
<P>
 The 100 and 200 highlighted a meet in which no records were set. Even the team 
title races were less exciting than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 In the boys' team competition, Pasadena Muir ran away with the title with 36 
points. Redlands and San Diego tied for second with 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland Skyline won its first girls' team title with 36 points and Oakland 
Bishop O'Dowd was second with 32. Long Beach Poly, the two-time defending 
champion, finished third with 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Muir won its first title since 1990 behind a strong performance from Ken 
Haslip. The USC-bound senior won the 300-intermediate hurdles and finished 
third in the 110-high hurdles. He also ran on the Mustangs' 1,600 and 400 
relays, which finished first and second, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone came through today, and we scored as I expected," said Muir Coach 
Clyde Turner. "There were no major disappointments." 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach Poly girls were favored to make it three consecutive titles, 
but they could not overcome the loss of All-American sprinter Andrea Anderson. 
Anderson re-aggravated a left hamstring injury during a preliminary heat in the 
200 on Friday and sat out Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Johnson, San Diego High's Mebrahtom Keflezighi was the only other 
individual double-event winner. The Eritrean-born Keflezighi started off with a 
victory in the 1,600 in 4:07.67 and added another in the 3,200 in 8:58.11.

<P>
 A season that began in frustration ended in jubilation as Fullerton High 
defeated La Puente Bishop Amat, 4-1, in 10 innings in the Southern Section 
Division II softball final Saturday at Lakewood's Mayfair Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Alissa Sorrell drew a bases-loaded walk for the go-ahead run, and pitcher 
Angie Fancuberta followed with a single. Fullerton (18-13), which began the 
season 6-12, recovered to win the Freeway League title. It was Fullerton's 
second Southern Section championship. The school also won the 3-A Division 
title in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Amat finished 22-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendora St. Lucy's 3, Redondo 0 -- Kia Zalewski (11-2) pitched a two-hitter, 
striking out seven and walking one, to lead St. Lucy's (21-8) to its first 
Division III championship. St. Lucy's scored all of its runs on five hits in 
the top of the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerry Martin gave up nine hits in seven innings for Redondo (23-8). Martin 
(22-5), a sophomore, finished with an 0.31 earned-run average in 178 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos Valley Christian 5, Lancaster Paraclete 1 -- Susie Schoales (16-2) 
threw a one-hitter to lead Valley Christian to the Division V title. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoales allowed three walks and struck out seven. She also had two hits, 
including a two-run single in the seventh. Schoales' string of 89 consecutive 
innings without allowing a run was broken when Paraclete scored in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Robinson doubled home three runs for Valley Christian (24-3-1) with two 
out in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Paraclete (24-6) was making its fifth appearance in a Southern Section final, 
finishing as runner-up each time. 
</P>
<P>
 Temecula Linfield 7, Hesperia Christian 5 -- Jeanette Smith drove in the 
winning run with a double in the top of the 13th inning to break a 5-5 tie and 
later scored on an error to give Linfied its third Southern Section 
championship in the Division VI final. 
</P>
<P>
 Janelle Gonzales (18-1), a freshman, gave up nine hits and five runs, four of 
them earned, and struck out five in 13 innings for Linfield (21-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Hesperia Christian finished 20-4. TIM STEVENS

<P>
 Defending champion Chip Hanauer's chances of winning a record 10th American 
Power Boat Assn. unlimited hydroplane Gold Cup today were dealt a blow Saturday 
when the driver of Miss Budweiser was injured in a freak pre-race accident on 
the Detroit River. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanauer was jockeying for position before the start of the first heat when the 
escape hatch on the bottom of the boat tore off, sending a wall of water into 
the cockpit.He was hospitalized with a strained back and injuries to the groin. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernie Little, owner of Miss Budweiser, said he would wait until today to 
decide if Hanauer could drive in the Gold Cup heats and final. Mike Hanson took 
over for Hanauer in the second heat Saturday and finished fifth after being 
penalized for hitting a buoy close to the grandstand area. 
</P>

 Mark Tate and Dave Villwock each won two heats. SHAV GLICK

SOUTHERN SECTION BASEBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS; J.W. NORTH DRESSES FOR THE OCCASION

 The hitting was dreadful. The pitching miserable. The defense giving. 
</P>
<P>
 So Riverside J.W. North made the obvious change before the playoffs began: its 
uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Switching from their regular jerseys to their batting practice shirts, the 
Huskies went through the five-game playoffs, beating Cerritos Gahr, 5-2, 
Saturday night at Blair Field in Long Beach to win their first Southern Section 
Division II baseball title before 1,012. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more like a coincidence," Husky second baseman Adam Kennedy said about 
winning with the new shirts. "Tonight everything came through." 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Hachee's RBI triple in the top of the fifth inning gave North (18-11) a 
3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Hurd, singled to score Hachee for a 4-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Larrie Bowen picked up the victory by pitching three scoreless innings. Val 
Pascucci was the losing pitcher for Gahr (22-6) with a three-inning, three-run 
(two earned) performance. 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta 3, West Torrance 1 -- Senior right-hander Jim Livernois gave up 
three hits to lead La Quinta to its first Southern Section Division III 
championship at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 West Torrance loaded the bases against Livernois (15-3) in the top of the 
seventh inning with two out. But La Quinta center fielder Anibal Delacruz ended 
the game with a running catch of a line drive hit by Derek Nicholson.

 Sousa, Linfield's catcher, drove in Shin Tamura, who had singled and stolen 
second, and Kyle Kane, who had walked.

EXCITED SIMPSON DELIVERS THE CROWNING THROW FOR FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amy Simpson stood there, her heart pumping a little more than usual, and 
waited. And waited. And waited. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the ball landed in her glove, the Fullerton left fielder knew exactly 
what she was going to do. 
</P>
<P>
 There was only one thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the strikes thrown in Fullerton's 4-1, 10-inning victory over 
third-seeded La Puente Bishop Amat in the Southern Section Division II 
championship game, the most important was Simpson's. She threw a one-hopper to 
catcher Kiki McAulay, nailing Natalie Kirkbride at home. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't perfect, but it was there in plenty of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkbride was trying to score what would have been the winning run, in the 
bottom of the sixth inning on Gina Luna's one-out fly to left field. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a chance Kirkbride had to take. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew if I didn't make the play, the game would be over," Simpson said. "It 
was as good a throw as I've made all year." 
</P>
<P>
 McAulay wasn't so sure. She said the ball short-hopped her. 
</P>
<P>
 "In practice, I've never caught any like that," McAulay said. "I hate throws 
like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had so much adrenaline, I wanted to get her out so bad. I knew that if we 
went extra innings, we would win because we're like the Queens of Extra 
Innings." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (19-13) won its first two playoff games in extra innings, defeating 
Savanna in nine, 1-0, and fourth-seeded Lakewood, 2-0, in 12 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Lakewood, Simpson also threw out a runner at home late in the game to 
protect a tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's play came during a stretch when Fullerton pitcher Angie Fancuberta 
was struggling, and it allowed Fullerton to remain in contention for the 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkbride had singled to left field and reached third on Raquel Alvarez's 
single to right. Needing a run against Fancuberta, who had surrendered two of 
the three hits allowed to that point in the sixth inning, there was never any 
question Kirkbride would try to score. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson had a big night. She also scored the winning run in the 10th. She was 
safe on an error by first baseman Kristina Chavez, took second on a hit 
batsman, third on a sacrifice. After McAulay was walked intentionally, Simpson 
scored when Alissa Sorrell was walked with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defensive play was more exciting to me," she said. "If I don't make that, 
the game's over."

FULLERTON'S FANCUBERTA USES ARM, BAT TO WIN; DIVISION II SOFTBALL: SOPHOMORE 
PITCHER'S KEY HITS HELP INDIANS BEAT LA PUENTE BISHOP AMAT, 4-1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fullerton softball Coach Scott Weber repeatedly has said the secret to his 
team's success this season has been hard work and team effort. 
</P>
<P>
 But a large dose of sophomore Angie Fancuberta has been a big key for the 
Indians, especially in their run through the Southern Section Division II 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fancuberta again was the heroine Saturday night at Mayfair Park, as she gave 
up three hits over 10 innings and had the key hit in both of the Indian rallies 
as Fullerton knocked off third-seeded La Puente Bishop Amat, 4-1, at Mayfair 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Fancuberta struggled in the middle innings, giving up her only earned run in 
45 innings of playoff action. She walked three and struck out 11. At the plate, 
she doubled to lead off the fourth, helping the Indians take a 1-0 lead, then 
had the only Fullerton base hit in a three-run 10th inning that sealed the 
Indians' (19-13) first Southern Section softball title in 10 years. It was 
their 10th victory in a row, and they beat the Nos. 4, 1 and 3-seeded teams in 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton took advantage of the Lancers' (22-5) generosity in putting together 
their game-winning rally. Two errors, a hit batsman, and an intentional walk 
loaded the bases with one out. Losing pitcher Chrissy Gil then walked to Alissa 
Sorrell, forcing in the winning run. Fancuberta singled to make it 3-1, and 
Deborah Hargrave contributed an RBI groundout to make it 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton opened the scoring in the top of the fourth inning. Fancuberta 
singled to right. Gina Luna tried to make a diving catch, but the ball caromed 
off her glove and into center field, allowing Fancuberta to advance to second. 
</P>
<P>
 Hargrave followed with a ground ball to third. Pinch-runner Ashley Jones 
alertly waited for the throw to first, which retired Hargrave, then broke for 
third and beat the throw across the diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 Nadia Hoerner hit a bouncer to second base, but Jones slid around the tag to 
give the Indians a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Amat took advantage of Fancuberta's wildness in the fifth, scoring the 
tying run without the benefit of a hit. After striking out Rhonda Luna to open 
the inning, Fancuberta issued consecutive walks to Kristina Chavez and Michelle 
Salinas, and a passed ball moved the Lancer runners to second and third with 
one down. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrie Woodward's ground ball to second drove in pinch-runner Laura Gomez, 
tying the score, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Angie just got rattled a little bit," Weber said. 'I don't know why 
-- that hasn't happened to her before -- but you have to remember she's only a 
sophomore and I think things got to her a little."

BULLFROGS HOPE GROWTH SPURT BODES WELL FOR TEAM, RHI; PREVIEW: DEFENDING ROLLER 
HOCKEY CHAMPIONS PREPARE TO OPEN A NEW SEASON WITH ENTHUSIASM ABOUT THE SHAPE 
OF THE TEAM AND THE LEAGUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Could Orange County have its first professional sports dynasty? 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, the Bullfrogs are shooting for what no professional sports 
franchise in the county has accomplished: back-to-back championships. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs won the Roller Hockey International championship last season and 
open defense of their title by hosting their Pacific Division rivals, the Los 
Angeles Blades, in the season opener at The Pond of Anaheim at 7 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so it's just roller hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 The fledgling league heads into its second season amid snickers from some ice 
hockey officials but growing support from others. 
</P>
<P>
 And consider these facts: 
</P>
<P>
 -- RHI expanded from 10 to 24 teams, and new owners include New York Rangers 
star Mark Messier, Pittsburgh Penguins owner Howard Baldwin, and former 
Montreal Canadiens great Yvan Cournoyer. The league now has franchises in most 
of the major markets including Montreal, Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 -- According to American Sports Data, Inc., in-line skating is the fastest 
growing activity in the nation. There are more than 5,000 amateur roller hockey 
leagues in North America and 1.6 million people are playing some form of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- ESPN agreed to a multiyear contract with the league. ESPN2 will broadcast a 
game of the week on Mondays and three playoff games and ESPN will carry three 
games, including the all-star game July 9 in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 "The league will be playing in the Montreal Forum," Bullfrogs President Nelson 
Silver said. "I think that says something, since hockey is such a revered sport 
in Montreal." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs hope to build a championship tradition and appear to have all 
the pieces in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten of 14 players return from last season, including leading scorer Victor 
Gervais, playoff MVP Bobby McKillop and team captain Kevin Kerr. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad McCaughey, the team's second-leading scorer, also returns. In addition to 
playing, McCaughey will be assistant coach and assistant general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm wearing a few different hats, but once the game starts I'm focused on 
just playing," McCaughey said. "There's no doubt that the team we have now is 
better than the team we finished with last season." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chris McSorley, older brother of Kings defenseman Marty McSorley, led 
the Bullfrogs to the title last season but left to become part-owner and coach 
of the expansion Buffalo Stampeders. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant Sonier, who served as McSorley's assistant last season, takes over as 
head coach this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year I thought I would be in jail for getting paid to coach roller 
hockey in California for the summer," Sonier said. "This season, we know it 
will be a lot tougher because everyone will have a team of ice hockey players 
like us." 
</P>
<P>
 One newcomer Sonier believes will be effective is Darren Langdon, a 6-foot-1, 
205-pound forward who played with the Binghamton Rangers of the American Hockey 
League this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darren will help create some team toughness and he'll make our physical 
presence entertaining as well," Sonier said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs' third-round draft pick, Yuri Krivokhija, and sixth-round pick 
Jim Brown also made the roster. Last season, the Bullfrogs retained no players 
from the free-agent draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Krivokhija is a talented, 6-3, 210-pound defenseman who played with the 
Milwaukee Admirals of the International Hockey League and Brown is a 
20-year-old with great offensive skills, Sonier said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Word spreads among the players," Sonier said. "We've had about 80-90 players, 
the bulk who were ice hockey players, who expressed interest in trying out this 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 Said McCaughey: "We've been able to pick and choose guys who will fit in with 
our chemistry. We have 17 guys who hate to lose."

BOWE HAS BACK INJURY, CANCELS FIGHT WITH MATHIS SET FOR JUNE 11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A back injury has forced former heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe to pull out 
of his scheduled June 11 bout against Buster Mathis Jr. at Caesars Palace in 
Las Vegas, Bowe's second canceled fight in four months. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowe suffered the injury May 27, saw a chiropractor and a doctor last week and 
could not get out of bed Friday.He has been told to stop training for about a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear whether the current injury will affect his July 15 bout at 
Hollywood Park against Larry Donald, who knocked out Juan Antonio Diaz 1:27 
into the sixth round Saturday at Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to play it by ear," Bowe's manager, Rock Newman, said Saturday. "A 
lot of things are up in the air." 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Bowe suffered a cut over his right eye in training that forced the 
cancellation of his Feb. 5 bout against Francois Botha, also scheduled for 
Caesars. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowe has not fought since he lost his World Boxing Assn. and International 
Boxing Federation titles to Evander Holyfield last November. 
</P>
<P>
 The three undercard fights on the Bowe-Mathis show probably will be held as 
scheduled on June 11, but be moved to the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Including its scheduled June 13 card, that would give the Forum two fight 
cards in three days. TIM KAWAKAMI

 The New York Jets released defensive lineman Leonard Marshall on Saturday, a 
little more than a year after signing him to a three-year, $4.5-million 
free-agent contract. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Dick Steinberg said a combination of the salary cap and 
Marshall's injuries forced the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 After 10 years and two Super Bowl rings with the New York Giants, Marshall, 
32, signed with the Jets. He started the first 12 games, then suffered an 
injured left forearm in Game 12 against Indianapolis and sat out the rest of 
the season.

BORDER CROSSING; UNHINDERED INTERSTATE BANKING IS ABOUT TO ARRIVE. FOR THE 
FIRST TIME, ACCOUNTS WILL FOLLOW CONSUMERS ACROSS STATE LINES. AND MEGA-BANKS 
ARE SURE TO GROW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The banking world of tomorrow is going to be one vast national forest where 
some big lenders will range at will across state borders, chewing up local 
competitors, while others aggressively defend their turf. 
</P>
<P>
 And like speedy ferrets, hundreds of the leanest independent banks will 
continue to thrive -- on the lookout, as always, for entrepreneurs who want to 
do lunch and arrange a quick line of credit. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what the financial landscape should look like in 1997, when the last 
barriers to interstate banking are likely to fall, flattened by the growth of 
big banking empires, modern computer communications and the diminished 
political clout of small banks. 
</P>
<P>
 The revolution will be completed by a historic piece of legislation virtually 
certain to be approved by Congress later this year as it rushes to catch up 
with the modern realities of the financial world and to put an end to a 
piecemeal system more suited to a time without interstate highways, computers 
or automatic teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens on Capitol Hill is often an "earthquake phenomenon," explained 
Washington banking consultant Edward Furash. "For a long time nothing seems to 
be happening, and suddenly something does. Then people understand there were 
tremors building up for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, banking has changed more in the past 15 years than at any time since 
the Depression: Mega-banks sprang up and moved across state lines, while about 
2,700 banks and thrifts disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Consolidating those trends, the interstate banking bill -- which awaits the 
approval of a House-Senate conference committee and would be implemented in 
phases within three years -- promises common-sense conveniences and alluring 
new business opportunities for consumers and lenders alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Customers will be able to do business with their bank across state lines -- 
making deposits, writing checks and borrowing money without regard to borders. 
They shouldn't have to open a new account whenever they move to take a new job, 
go on a long vacation or buy a retirement home. 
</P>
<P>
 * All 50 states will be wide open for acquisitions. Any bank will be able to 
venture into a state to buy any other bank. 
</P>
<P>
 * Banks that already operate in more than one state -- but with separate 
corporate structures in each and computers that can't communicate -- will be 
able to convert all operations into branches of the parent bank. The industry 
savings could total in the billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, there were just 16 interstate bank holding companies, with just $85 
billion in assets. In 1994, there are approximately 190 holding companies 
operating in multiple states, with an estimated $2.5 trillion in assets -- 
about two-thirds of all commercial bank assets, according to James Barth, 
professor of finance at Auburn University. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the assets held by independent banks shrank from $405 billion in 
1980 to $215 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? 
</P>
<P>
 A consolidation began in earnest during the early 1980s, when Congress allowed 
banks and thrifts to acquire failing financial institutions in other states. 
Healthy firms bought the industry casualties -- with generous financial help 
from the federal deposit insurance funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In other cases, sound lenders eager to expand persuaded state legislatures to 
allow reciprocal entry with other states. The results were the so-called 
regional compacts, in which states opened their banking markets to their 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 But the wave of consolidation, while it brought more total assets to the 
growing banks, did not make life easier for customers. While a banker's name 
and logo may have crossed state borders, convenience didn't travel with it. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, for example, 60 million Americans living and working in 
metropolitan areas that span state lines. These consumers are unable to follow 
their banks across the geographical boundaries for something so simple as 
making a deposit or cashing a check.  
</P>
<P>
 Thus Chase Manhattan customers who bank in Greenwich, Conn., but work in New 
York City cannot walk into Chase offices in New York to make their deposits, 
because the Chase banks in the two states are separate entities. 
</P>
<P>
 This system "doesn't make any sense," said Rep. Stephen L. Neal (D-N.C.), 
chairman of the financial institutions subcommittee of the House Banking 
Committee. "It would be as if Sears in each state had a separate board of 
directors, separate operating systems, separate computers and credit cards." 
</P>
<P>
 Each house of Congress has adopted its own version of legislation that would 
tear the barriers down. Once you had an account, it could go everywhere your 
bank operates. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can keep your same checking and savings accounts when you move from 
Bakersfield to Phoenix or Phoenix to Sacramento," said Luke Helms, vice 
chairman of BankAmerica, which is forced to run separate banking systems in 10 
different states. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Congress acts, there should be no more angry customers like Debra 
Kilpatrick of Richmond, Va., who told a Senate hearing last year about a 
vacation gone awry because of the arcane rules that govern banking.  
</P>
<P>
 Kilpatrick said she didn't have time to deposit a mutual fund check at her 
local NationsBank branch in Virginia before heading south to North Carolina for 
a holiday. "Imagine my consternation," she told the lawmakers, "when the bank 
in North Carolina told me that because of interstate banking regulations, I was 
unable to deposit my check . . . in my own bank account because my account was 
a Virginia account and I was trying to deposit it in North Carolina." 
</P>
<P>
 It is anybody's guess which lenders will become the interstate aggressors when 
the barriers come down. 
</P>
<P>
 As many states began opening their doors over the last 15 years, the 
conventional wisdom was that a handful of gigantic money-center banks would be 
the ones to "watch and fear," Federal Reserve Board member Susan M. Phillips 
told a recent banking conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she noted, local banks grew into super-regionals and leapfrogged 
across the country. "Who expanded?" said Phillips. "It's been the banks from 
Charlotte, N.C.; Columbus, Ohio; Providence, R.I., and Minneapolis, Minn." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips was referring to NationsBank Corp., Banc One Corp., Fleet Financial 
Group Inc. and Norwest Corp., each of which grew from a comparatively minor 
local bank into the ranks of the nation's 15 biggest bank holding companies. 
</P>
<P>
 These super-regional competitors might head right for California once the 
barriers are down completely, according to Julius Loeser, senior vice president 
for government relations at First Interstate Bancorp, the Los Angeles-based 
parent of a pioneer multi-state banking web. 
</P>
<P>
 "California is a very attractive market," Loeser said. "We have hundreds of 
small, inexpensive banks that could be bought fairly easily." 
</P>
<P>
 But California and the other Far Western states may prove a tough region for 
outsiders to penetrate. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still some advantages to markets similar to the ones you operate 
in," said Fred Furlong, vice president for banking and regional studies at the 
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. "Phoenix is more like Los Angeles than 
New York." 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the nation's top 15 bank holding companies are based in California -- 
Bank of America Corp., First Interstate Bancorp, and Wells Fargo & Co. -- and 
all three are concentrating on deepening and developing the markets where they 
already do business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our plate is kind of full right now," said Bank of America's Helms. "We are 
in states with terrific growth opportunities" -- among them California, Nevada, 
Washington and Texas. If somebody wants to grab a piece of Bank of America's 
business, he said, "they're going to have to work pretty hard to take it away 
from us." 
</P>
<P>
 At Chase Manhattan's headquarters in New York, the regional outlook is much 
the same. "We view ourselves as having a corridor of business running from 
Boston to the metropolitan Washington area," said John Hanley, vice president 
for government relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The pending legislation would not have been possible without the grudging 
acceptance of independent bankers, who traditionally have wielded substantial 
political power and long have feared the arrival of big rivals in their local 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The gradual opening of markets, combined with a new Democratic Administration 
in the White House, convinced them that sustaining their opposition would be 
futile. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fight has gone out of it at the state level," said Ken Guenther, 
executive director of the Independent Bankers Assn. of America. "If there are 
only 10 states that do not already have their doors open fully, that means you 
have only 20 senators to fight on your side. The rest don't care." 
</P>
<P>
 And, said Guenther, "President Clinton wanted the bill very strongly." 
Clinton, he noted, sat in the private box of Hugh McColl, hard-charging 
chairman of NationsBank, at the NCAA basketball championship this year in 
Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 McColl was an early and enthusiastic backer of Clinton's run for the 
presidency. For NationsBank, meanwhile, the consolidation of separate state 
units could mean savings of an estimated $50 million or more per year. 
</P>
<P>
 In backing interstate banking legislation, the White House insisted on a 
so-called "clean bill" -- one stripped of many of the things that consumer 
groups wanted: special attention to the credit needs of poor and minority 
neighborhoods, for example, and assurances that banks wouldn't wipe out 
branches in all but the most affluent sections. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were steamrollered," said Michelle Meier, lobbyist for Consumers Union. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how much the giant banks grow through interstate expansion, many 
independent bankers are confident they will keep their profitable niche of 
dealing with up-and-coming manufacturers, distributors and vendors, as well as 
wealthy professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 For these customers, the "personal financial situation is intertwined with 
their business," said George H. Benter Jr., president and chief operating 
officer of City National Bank in Beverly Hills. Such clients might need rapid 
approval for a loan to make a corporate acquisition or advice about some 
personal investments. Or they might just want to have lunch with the bank 
president to talk about where interest rates are going. 
</P>
<P>
 At another independent, Marathon National in Los Angeles, president Chip 
Morrow figures that "a boutique bank like ours serves 3% or 4% of the 
population -- people who want individual service and the ability to talk to the 
president." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow believes he can live peacefully in the new forest of banking, getting 
enough to eat without being trampled by the giants. And if one of the big 
companies makes him a financial offer he can't refuse -- in the form of a 
generous proposal to buy the bank -- that's not so bad, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the nature of the beast," said Morrow. "Anyone running a business 
hopes one day to retire when someone offers a humongous amount of money to buy 
you out." Border Crossing 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last decade, the nation's biggest banking companies have broken free 
of the bonds that tied them to their home states, spreading across state 
borders even without congressional authorization of interstate banking. Of 
today's top 15 bank holding companies, ranked here by total assets, only two -- 
Los Angeles-based First Interstate and Minneapolis-based Norwest -- operated in 
more than one state in 1980. In 1994, only one -- San Francisco-based Wells 
Fargo -- limits its operations to a single state.

<P>
 The obstacles to bank expansion have fallen, bit by bit, over the past 70 
years: 
</P>
<P>
 1927 McFadden Act: Allows nationally-chartered banks to branch within their 
communities, if state-chartered banks are allowed to have multiple branches. 
Banks barred from branching outside their home states. 
</P>
<P>
 1933 Banking Act: Allows federally-chartered banks to locate statewide in 
states where state-chartered banks are permitted to branch. 
</P>
<P>
 1975: First interstate banking law. Maine says a holding company based in 
another state can acquire a Maine bank, if that state allots similar privileges 
to Maine banks. 
</P>
<P>
 1982 Garn-St. Germain Act: Permits acquisition of a large, failing savings and 
loan association (with assets of $500 million or more) in one state by a bank 
from another state, regardless of state laws. 
</P>
<P>
 1983: First regional compact. New England states allow reciprocal interstate 
banking. 
</P>
<P>
 1985-1992: Wave of bank and thrift failures. Encouraged by federal regulators, 
healthy banks and thrifts spread across the country, acquiring ailing or 
insolvent institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 1994: House and Senate pass separate bills opening all states to interstate 
banking. Final version expected to be adopted and signed by President Clinton 
later this year.

TWO CLASSES OF FIRST PENSION INVESTORS FACE DIFFERENT ODDS; INVESTMENTS: A Q&A 
WITH COURT-APPOINTED RECEIVER OF FIRM THAT HANDLED CLIENT FUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a staff of just three employees, attorney Andrew C. Snyder has his work 
cut out for him. 
</P>
<P>
 As court-appointed receiver for Summit Trust Services of Colorado -- the 
company created by the three principals of failed First Pension Corp. in Irvine 
to handle client money -- Snyder is trying to untangle the twisted web of 
thousands of retirement accounts and track down more than $24 million in 
missing investor funds. Summit was seized by Colorado banking authorities April 
22. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as $124 million of the money invested by 8,000 First Pension clients 
may have been lost to fraud and outright theft. Numerous clients may have 
invested in mortgages that did not exist, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the three First Pension principals -- William E. Cooper, Valerie Jensen 
and Robert Lindley -- are cooperating with federal investigators and have 
agreed to eventually plead guilty to some criminal charges in connection with 
what securities regulators have described as an elaborate pyramid scheme, the 
three have yet to cooperate with Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with staff writer Debora Vrana, Snyder describes the 
distinctions between investors who used First Pension only as an administrator 
for their retirement funds and those clients who invested in allegedly 
fraudulent mortgage pools marketed through First Diversified Financial Services 
Inc., the parent of First Pension. He gives investors an idea of what to expect 
in upcoming months.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What are you trying to achieve as trustee for Summit? 
</P>
<P>
 A. My obligation under Colorado law is to sell the company, or, if possible, 
reorganize it. To do this, I have continued to retain Kenneth Lyon, the former 
president of Summit, and two other former Summit employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Our phones have been ringing off the hook. Since the bankruptcy, we've been 
getting about 20 to 30 calls each day from investors, and also some from 
brokers who were responsible for bringing people in, and even some from the 
accountants. We are supervising the daily transactions and affairs of Summit. 
In addition, we are still receiving (client's interest) checks and trying to 
track down the missing money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. At a bankruptcy hearing last week for First Pension, you told investors 
that Summit has only 30%, or about $9 million, of the $34 million in funds it 
is supposed to have. How does this affect investors' chances of getting their 
funds back? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Right now, what we think is left is about 30 cents on the dollar of cash, 
that's not including the mortgage pools. These people took a risk and invested 
in the mortgage pools. And it not my present intention under a yet-to-be 
proposed distribution plan to assist people who invested in the pools in 1982, 
and have been receiving earnings ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Why aren't the concerns of people who invested in the possibly phony 
mortgage pools being addressed under the bankruptcy filing by First Pension and 
the shutdown of Summit? These investors seem to be in the worst straits. 
</P>
<P>
 A. Well, nobody filed a bankruptcy petition for First Diversified or for the 
limited real estate partnerships, so those investors still can't get 
partnership investor lists or determine what assets may still exist. (All 
assets of First Diversified were frozen by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission on May 23, when the assets of its principals, Cooper, Jensen and 
Lindley were frozen.) It's not that we are avoiding any custodial obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Well, who is going to do something about these real estate pools? They are 
just sitting there, and investors can't get any answers. 
</P>
<P>
 A. I understand the frustration about this, and I'm not trying to dodge your 
question. I don't know why we aren't getting off our duffs and doing something 
about the partnerships. Investors in these partnerships need to get organized. 
They need to get together, hire someone to represent them in an attempt to 
replace their assets. It may be they are chasing windmills. 
</P>
<P>
 The probability is that the majority of these mortgage-pool assets were just 
entries on a computer system. You had a lot of sheep here that listened to the 
First Pension wolf. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What are the chances that anyone in the mortgage pools will get their money 
back? 
</P>
<P>
 A. You tell me what the stock market is going to be on Dec. 31 and I will tell 
you if they will get their money back. I think the answer is available when I 
get a chance to question Cooper, Lindley and Jensen about what happened. My 
knowledge will depend on what information the federal authorities will share 
with me. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Is it frustrating that the three principals from First Pension are 
reportedly cooperating with the criminal investigation, yet not providing any 
information or answers yet to you, the receiver? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Hopefully, we will get some information soon. At this point the three have 
agreed to plead guilty, but the charges still have to be filed. After a formal 
guilty plea is entered to the charges when they are filed, then we should get 
some answers. It is my anticipation that we will get some answers before the 
end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What is the most common question you get from investors? 
</P>
<P>
 A. They all want to know "How do I get my money?" And the answer is, "I have 
frozen the accounts, and we are trying to track it down." The other thing they 
all say is, "Gee, I thought my money was insured." Well, the remaining cash, 
the 30%, is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to the tune of 
$100,000 (per account) against the failure of First Interstate Bank of Denver, 
where the remaining money is sitting in accounts. FDIC does not insure the 
funds against fraud or failure of the custodian, Summit Trust, or the 
administrator, First Pension. It only insures against fraud and failure of the 
bank, First Interstate, which is open and fully functioning. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Where do you think the missing investment funds went? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Probably back to the earlier investors, as in the typical pyramid scheme. 
Some was sent to Singapore, and I can't tell you how much went offshore, or 
into (other companies). 
</P>
<P>
 A. It's hard to say whether they are OK; we believe that investors who had 
their funds in trust deeds with other companies and there is an existing 
mortgage or tangible assets, then to my knowledge those are still performing. 
So business and transactions can occur with relation to those assets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Are you conducting transfers or other transactions on those accounts for 
investors? 
</P>
<P>
 A. We just do not have the staff to conduct transfers (to other investments) 
for everyone. First Pension was the pension administrator, and they had a staff 
of about 40 people doing this. We have three. So, it has to be an emergency 
situation. And most people think: "If I don't have any cash, that's an 
emergency situation," but I'm talking about emergencies like being sick or 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. When could another pension administrator, such as California Central Trust 
Bank in Irvine, assume control of the retirement plans of First Pension clients 
and provide such services?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Such a move would be subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court here, 
and the regulators in Colorado. It may take 30 days, or it may take 60 days. 
The most important issue is finding a pension administrator. We think the 
sooner we can get these accounts operating again is more important than the 
price we can get someone to pay you for these custodian assets. I am in favor 
of getting Cal-Trust. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. One investor told me $25,000 of his IRA funds were just sitting in a cash 
account with First Pension. Such funds cannot be transferred or withdrawn, 
correct? And what is the likelihood that they are still there? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Well, the answer is they could move the money when we make a determination 
to unfreeze the assets. If I believe the records show that you have $25,000 and 
you want to transfer $10,000, I may be able to do it. The problem is I don't 
have an administrator right now and we're just not equipped to deal with all 
the administrative duties. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What should investors who want to protect their funds managed by First 
Pension be doing now? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Honestly, there's nothing you can do. The money is frozen and what's left 
is FDIC insured and earning interest. The only people I really want to hear 
from are those who have an emergency need for distribution, not those who feel 
they are losing out on some investment or because they think they have some 
stock tip. Investors should sit tight. We will be sending out letters to 
investors this week giving them an update.

their accounts held at Summit should write to:

JAMES FLANIGAN: CHINA IN ITS CHRYSALIS REQUIRES A DEFT TOUCH BY U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What is really going on in China? Hundreds of people are sleeping at railway 
stations in the rural areas, waiting days for the chance to buy a ticket so 
they can go to Beijing, Shanghai and other cities to find construction work. 
Estimates put the number of people on the move in China at over 100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The trains are slow, but they are the mode of travel in China because roads 
are poor and there is little motor transport. There is insufficient 
electricity, so factories often shut down a day or more per week. That's why 
China is determined to build more than 50 power plants in the next five years. 
It has just arranged $120 million in financing for a power project from a 
syndicate led by J.P. Morgan & Co. and from Nippon Life Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The boom in China's economy is real because it's based in part on more than a 
decade of surpluses in agriculture, which began in the late 1970s when 
Beijing's Communist government first allowed farmers to earn their own money 
and decide their own crops. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is moving into the industrial stage, hence rural people leaving the 
land for big cities in all parts of the country. In Chengdu in Sichuan -- the 
central China province that U.S. restaurants call Szechuan and whose 110 
million people make it larger than most countries -- construction cranes are 
busy day and night and workers can earn the equivalent of $20 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 But growth of almost 14% a year is too fast, and inflation in the cities has 
been hitting 40% -- imposing a hardship even on college-educated elites who 
earn $100 a month, more if they work for foreign companies. Corruption is 
rampant as politicians line their pockets. And robberies and labor unrest are 
on the rise, so the government has been trying to slow development to a more 
manageable pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Such chaos is normal for a developing nation, but China is no ordinary 
country. Its population alone -- 1.2 billion -- gives it great potential. Poor 
as it is today, China has an economy the size of Canada's. And if China could 
lift its economic output per person -- now under $500 a year -- to that of 
South Korea -- roughly $7,000 -- the total Chinese economy would be greater 
than that of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to that China's military power and its role as cultural and political 
leader of Asia and you can understand why President Clinton, tacitly 
acknowledging his own mistake, recently renewed most-favored-nation trading 
status for China. 
</P>
<P>
 He was attacked for "putting profit before principle" in not cutting China off 
as punishment for government persecution of political dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's nice rhetoric and faulty logic. To begin with, the idea of using 
trade as a weapon is flawed strategy. If China doesn't comply with U.S. 
demands, who is penalized? Cutting China's $31 billion in exports to the United 
States, mostly of shoes and apparel, would only make the country more 
economically dependent on Japan while hurting American businesses competing for 
China's market. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, it would sharply reduce U.S. influence in emerging Asia, 
destined to become the wealthiest region on Earth. How far Asia has come can be 
gauged from the fact that 80% of the investments in China today are not from 
Japan or the United States but from business people in Taiwan, Hong Kong and 
Singapore, three city-states that now have a combined capital surplus of more 
than $100 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, entrepreneurs inside China are busily investing in Hong Kong or 
sending money for safekeeping to the United States. Politics aside, commercial 
ties are growing between the United States and China, most prominently in the 
work U.S. companies are doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Caterpillar Inc. has joint ventures to build diesel engines and hydraulic 
excavators in China. Boeing may be about to get a $5-billion order for planes 
to upgrade China's air fleet. AT&T is installing phone systems and upgrading 
China's air traffic control systems. Raytheon and Foster Wheeler are supplying 
boilers and servicing power plants. The list goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but so do arrests by China's government. Has America no choice but to 
trade with the devil? The answer is that America has many choices, as the 
Clinton Administration would realize if it developed a real foreign policy. In 
different circumstances in the past, the United States has kept its principles 
and done what works. Thus it sold wheat to the Soviet Union but kept guns 
drawn; in South Africa, U.S. sanctions cut off international bank credit. 
</P>
<P>
 And in China, a U.S. tactic is working that in fact may represent a shrewd 
policy. U.S. thinking is to let the world market flood the country with 
capital, reckoning that economic growth and modern technology loosen the 
control of totalitarian government. 
</P>
<P>
 Growth is forcing change. Five years after China's army mowed down student 
demonstrators in Tian An Men Square, the focus of dissent is now economic. 
Workers and farmers are protesting conditions and arbitrary rules, organizing 
into unions and cooperatives under the leadership of reformers such as Wei 
Jingsheng, now the most prominent jailed dissident. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports in Washington say such organizations are receiving quiet help from 
U.S. intelligence agencies, as did the Solidarity union in Poland over a decade 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, quiet pressure is the way to go. Trying to push China around 
won't work, nor will it gain the support of Asian allies who don't welcome 
foreigners telling them what to do. "The strongest impulse driving Asia today 
is to erase the humiliation by foreign powers in the 19th Century," says China 
scholar Chalmers Johnson of UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean antagonism to the United States. It means Asian countries 
following their own course and expecting the United States to devise post-Cold 
War policies to deal with them. 
</P>
<P>
 China and Asia represent challenge as well as opportunity. The China that is 
emerging is an energetic place. "They do their homework and learn quickly," 
says Teddy Huang, AT&T's director of Far East switching systems, of Chinese 
personnel installing modern phone systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Another U.S. businessman, who prefers to speak anonymously, compares joint 
venture partners in three countries: "In Russia and India, top people were 
eager but the managers and workers most directly affected didn't really listen. 
In China, everybody listened." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you what America has to do to respond to China today," says a U.S. 
chief executive who is building power plants in Asia. "It has to educate its 
own children, so we won't be left behind."

VIEW FROM WASHINGTON / ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT; SEN. KERRY DOESN'T THINK 
ENTITLEMENTS ARE NECESSARILY A BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT writes about banking, health care 
and other national issues from The Times' Washington bureau. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Bob Kerrey, a maverick Democrat from Nebraska, wants a fearful Congress 
to touch "the third rail of politics" -- the vastly popular entitlement 
programs, such as Social Security and Medicare, that account for an ever larger 
share of federal spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrey is a thorn in the side for President Clinton and the Democratic 
Establishment. As the price for his vote last year backing the Clinton budget, 
he extracted the creation of a commission on entitlement reform. And he's 
stubborn enough to insist that the commission, which he chairs with Sen. John 
Danforth (R-Mo.), won't give birth to one of those impressively thick, but 
unread, reports so often stacked on Washington office shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he hopes to persuade an always nervous Congress and an even more 
anxious group, the millions of Americans who collect benefits, that they must 
make some sacrifices. This could mean such controversial steps as giving up 
part of the annual cost-of-living raises in benefit checks or linking Medicare 
premiums to a person's income -- and then making the affluent elderly pay a lot 
more than the current $41.10 a month paid by everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to persuade people who are beneficiaries that the No. 1 issue is 
that the economy isn't growing as fast as it should," says Kerrey, one of the 
toughest of deficit hawks. He believes fervently that the economy will never 
return to rapid growth if the huge deficit keeps consuming cash that could be 
used for private investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's just an argument over 'Will you cut my benefits, yes or no?' then I 
lose that argument," Kerrey admits. "I lose unless I make this a successful 
patriotic appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 He's fighting against big odds. 
</P>
<P>
 In President Clinton's first budget year, federal spending grew automatically 
by $48 billion, fueled by the big four of entitlements: Medicare, $17 billion; 
Social Security, $17 billion; Medicaid, $11 billion, and pensions for the 
government's civilian and military retirees -- $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 For next year, spending will grow $50 billion more, without benefit of action 
by the President or Congress. Entitlement means just that -- if you are 
eligible for the program, you get the money, and the rolls of recipients grow 
inexorably every year. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Washington headquarters of the American Assn. of Retired Persons -- 
with more than 30 million members the King Kong of the elderly lobby -- they 
regard Kerrey as a man dangerously obsessed with a single issue and offering a 
wrong-headed solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "The federal deficit is only one factor in this country's economic problem," 
says John Rother, director of public policy. "The runaway costs of health care, 
the problems of the education system and other things affecting productivity 
are more important than the deficit." 
</P>
<P>
 AARP says Kerrey's single-minded focus on the deficit blinds him to larger 
realities. Medicare is just part of a bigger problem of runaway health costs 
that won't be solved until the nation adopts major health care reform. And the 
Social Security payroll tax is in temporary surplus, generating $60 billion 
more in revenues this year than the government pays out in benefits to 
retirees, survivors and disabled persons, Rother notes. "You can hardly say 
that's the problem driving the deficit," he contends. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides are in stark, irreconcilable dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50-year-old Kerrey believes that Social Security will be there for him at 
retirement, but he worries about the taxes his children, 19-year-old Ben and 
17-year-old Lindsey, will have to pay in the next century to keep their dad's 
benefit checks flowing. 
</P>
<P>
 AARP says not to worry. Fix the health care system and Medicare will fix 
itself. There's plenty of time to make some minor changes in Social Security to 
assure that the fund doesn't reach the bankruptcy predicted by the trustees for 
the year 2029. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole purpose of Kerrey and Danforth's entitlements commission is to 
attack the AARP point of view and press for major changes in Social Security 
and Medicare. Kerrey says his Democratic congressional colleagues tell him -- 
privately -- that nothing is too sacred for debate, that "everything is on the 
table." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Democrats have feasted in almost every election on Medicare and Social 
Security, proclaiming themselves the party of compassion that will safeguard 
benefits for the elderly, the ill and the retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Kerrey has a different idea. "Neither party is going to win if the United 
States economy doesn't grow," he says. Democrats "are discovering today we can 
win on crime and we can win on welfare," says the former Nebraska governor, a 
Medal of Honor recipient in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a topsy-turvy world where the Cold War ends, the Berlin Wall comes down 
and the Israelis and Palestinians make peace. So maybe something really strange 
can happen -- like a Democratic senator leading a tough national debate over 
the future of Medicare and Social Security.

U.S. GOLF CLUB MANUFACTURER CARRIES A ...; BIG STICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In this golf-crazy land, the Biggu Basa may be the ultimate American import 
success story. 
</P>
<P>
 The Biggu Basa -- as the Japanese have dubbed the Big Bertha golf club made by 
Carlsbad, Calif.-based Callaway Golf Co. -- draws much praise here. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you hit a ball that's on the ground, it's easy for it to go too low or 
off to the side. But if you use the Big Bertha, the ball goes up and falls," 
explained Masayuki Kamioka, a businessman recently found inspecting clubs at a 
discount golf shop here. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobukazu Sakai, an architecture office employee who also works as a golf 
instructor, said Big Bertha's oversized head gives the club an extra-large 
"sweet spot," so that "the ball flies in the right direction and goes a long 
distance." 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps Big Bertha is a tad too successful for Callaway, which recently 
drew the wrath of some Japanese golf enthusiasts for what Callaway 
representatives say was a simple attempt to block fakes imported from Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 The crackdown also netted unauthorized importers of real Big Berthas. These 
so-called parallel importers were helping to meet soaring demand -- and, in a 
small way, reduce Japan's trade surplus with the United States -- all at a 
lower cost to Japan's famously eager golfers. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Callaway's official distributor, Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd., 
imported 180,000 Callaway clubs, modified slightly for the Japanese market. But 
another 150,000 standard Callaway clubs were purchased in the United States by 
independent importers and brought to Japan for resale at prices lower than 
those charged for Sumitomo's imports. 
</P>
<P>
 And, unhappily for Callaway, in recent years some Taiwan-based manufacturers 
have managed to get about 10,000 fake "Big Berthas" a year into Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 When Callaway convinced Japanese customs officials to crack down on 
counterfeits earlier this year, some Japanese smelled a scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Customs officials in January suddenly blocked the import of all Callaway clubs 
except those handled directly by Sumitomo or other importers who had obtained 
Callaway's express permission. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Bertha drivers imported through Sumitomo were selling at the time for 
about $500 each. But independent traders could get them for $200 or less in the 
United States and resell them here at much lower markups. To many, the action 
by customs looked like a blatant attempt to shut down sales of the cheaper 
parallel-import Big Berthas in order to maintain high-priced monopoly sales 
through Sumitomo. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese magazines that had praised "Big Berthas" exploded with angry 
articles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The True Facts and the Repercussions of the Stopping of Callaway Parallel 
Imports! Will You Never Have Another Chance To Get Parallel Import Big 
Berthas!?" screamed a headline in Par Golf magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Callaway Moves to Destroy Parallel Imports," declared Nikkei Trendy, a 
magazine specializing in coverage of popular new products. "Imports are Stopped 
by using Patent Rights as a Shield." 
</P>
<P>
 Yasuo Nakagawa, Callaway's Tokyo lawyer, said in an interview that the entire 
uproar resulted from Callaway's determination to stop the import of fake clubs 
to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Japanese law and customs procedures, he said, once Callaway exercised 
its Japanese-registered "design patent" rights on Big Bertha clubs to get fakes 
blocked, customs began stopping all parallel imports. Basically, he said, it is 
too troublesome and time-consuming for customs officials to differentiate 
genuine clubs handled by parallel importers from the fakes.  
</P>
<P>
 "You could say that, in a way, Callaway is choking its own throat," Nakagawa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stopping of parallel imports will cut Callaway's total sales 
significantly, he acknowledged. "Actually, some factory orders have already 
been canceled in the United States. But Callaway put precedence on its design 
patent right," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The action by customs' officials came as a shock to parallel importers. 
</P>
<P>
 "A total of 500 Big Berthas we tried to import were stopped at customs," said 
an independent importer who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, we didn't know what had happened, because we were importing real 
American products, not fakes," he said. These clubs were being imported for 
clients who "were planning to sell Big Berthas, and had already advertised them 
. . . . They were using Big Bertha as an 'eye catch' for sales, so it was very 
important to them to get them. So this caused big trouble for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Callaway took what it figured was a reasonable approach to this problem: 
Independent importers could bring in clubs stopped by customs, Nakagawa said, 
if they promised to discontinue such imports in the future and paid 2,000 yen 
-- about $19 per club -- in "damages" to reimburse the time and expense of a 
Callaway representative visiting the customs office to handle the procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no legal obligation to issue such consent," Nakagawa added. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parallel importers were insulted, nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Customs wanted us to sign a letter of apology," complained another importer, 
who also spoke on condition of anonymity. "There wasn't room for negotiation. 
They just said, if you want to import those golf clubs, you have to pay 2,000 
yen each, and we were supposed to sign a paper saying we'd never do it again. 
Our feeling was that the way customs treated us it was almost like we committed 
some kind of crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Other importers tried to skirt the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "This golf club was selling like mad," said a U.S.-based Japanese trader. "The 
price is very expensive in Japan, so people like me, parallel importers, sent a 
lot of Big Berthas. If we send a lot of clubs, the price gets cheap. But they 
like to keep the price high . . . It is a very unreasonable decision by the 
Japanese government . . . They are just trying to be mean to us." 
</P>
<P>
 When customs cracked down, this importer was stuck with a relatively modest 
stockpile of clubs in California. So he turned to friends for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked about eight friends to help me carry these clubs to Tokyo," he 
explained. "You say to customs, 'I will give them to my family and friends.' 
But actually, we do business." 
</P>
<P>
 Many parallel importers also point out that if they were allowed to conduct 
their business more freely, they could contribute more to easing the huge trade 
imbalance between Japan and the United States. Japan's surplus ran at $60 
billion last year, provoking a sharpening of trade tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very strange phenomenon, considering the current situation. Japan 
should be buying more American products. So we parallel importers think we are 
contributing to this country," said an independent golf equipment wholesaler. 
"I'm puzzled by the fact that we are forced to stop the imports." 
</P>
<P>
 While the parallel importers were angry, some foreign firms and designated 
importers handling other products thought they saw in Callaway's actions a way 
to maintain monopoly distribution networks in Japan, Nakagawa said. Several 
contacted him for advice. But Nakagawa said he replied that Callaway was 
successful in stopping parallel imports only because its main purpose was to 
stop fakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go to the customs office with the intent to stop parallel imports, the 
customs office will not accept it, because that's clearly against the 
anti-trust law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Callaway's new Big Bertha WarBird clubs have arrived in 
Japan, and sure enough, shops have two-tiered prices, one for Sumitomo's 
imports and a cheaper price for parallel importers' goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Customs has let independent importers back into the business because there 
aren't any fakes out yet on the Big Bertha WarBird, said Yuji Hattori, manager 
of a golf shop in Tokyo's discount-oriented Okachimachi district. "The old 
version has been stopped at customs," he explained. "But the new version is 
coming through."

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: 3 KEYS TO REAL ESTATE: SCHOOLS, SCHOOLS, 
SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 For Les and Deborah Granow it was the $100,000 question. Should their family 
buy the small three-bedroom home in Manhattan Beach or stay in a larger, 
prettier and newer home in Playa del Rey -- just a few miles away. They chose 
the smaller house that was more expensive. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 "Schools," says Les. "If we stayed in Playa del Rey we would be sending our 
kids to private schools. So I paid $100,000 more for a smaller house. And I 
would do it again tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Les, a Los Angeles tax accountant, calculated what it would cost him in 
after-tax dollars to send two children to private schools for 12 years. The 
result was stunning -- more than $200,000. So the extra $100,000 he spent on a 
home in the lauded Manhattan Beach school district, where he plans to send his 
children to public schools, seems like a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Granows are by no means alone. All over the country, parents who are 
forced to send their children to private schools because of poor conditions or 
inferior education at some local public schools find that the cost of private 
schooling can be crippling. Often, instead of paying tuition ranging between 
$2,000 and $10,000 a year, they opt to buy in top school districts even when 
that means they must pay more for a less desirable home. 
</P>
<P>
 Houses in top school districts often sell for tens of thousands -- even 
hundreds of thousands -- more than houses near less desirable schools, adds 
Marvin Smith, president of the San Marino-South Pasadena Board of Realtors. 
Houses on the border of San Marino and South Pasadena underscore the point, he 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Los Angeles-area towns are similar in many ways, but San Marino's 
schools are consistently ranked among the best in the state, Smith notes. The 
result is houses on the San Marino side of Garfield Blvd. -- the dividing line 
between the two towns -- can sell for as much as 25% more than houses on the 
South Pasadena side, he says. And South Pasadena schools aren't bad. They're 
just not as highly rated as San Marino schools, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 While the school-based disparity in housing prices may be difficult to fathom 
for those who are not parents, for parents it's a simple dollars-and-cents 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are forced to choose between paying private school tuition or moving to 
a better school district -- even if that means paying tens of thousands more 
for the house -- you're usually better off making the move, financial pundits 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because property taxes and mortgage interest expenses are tax 
deductible. Private school tuition is not, says Steven Friedman, regional 
director of the real estate advisory group at Ernst & Young, a national 
accounting firm. In the end, most people are no worse off paying $10,000 in 
additional mortgage interest expenses each year than they would be if they were 
paying $5,000 annually in tuition, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Nancy Blume, a Miami-area mother of three, who says she didn't pay 
quite enough attention to the quality of schools when they moved to Florida 
from Denver. They bought a house in a second-tier school district because 
houses near the top elementary school cost more and were less attractive, she 
says. Six years and $50,000 in private school tuition later, Blume says she 
would think twice if faced with the same decision again even though her 
children are now in public "magnet" schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But at what point does paying more for real estate in a top school district 
get out of hand? There's a fairly simple calculation to find out. However, 
there are some caveats. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the calculation assumes that everything stays constant, 
including the cost of tuition, tax rates and the comparative values of real 
estate. That's frequently not the case. Over the past several years, the cost 
of private schools and tax rates both have risen. That would argue for buying a 
home in a good school district. You'd avoid the rising private tuition and get 
a comparatively larger mortgage interest deduction on your presumably bigger 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 Realtors maintain that the value of homes in good school districts also tends 
to rise faster than in less desirable districts. However, if the school 
district suddenly loses quality, homeowners could lose, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, if you base your purchase on just one measurement of the schools 
efficacy, you could also be hurt. A recent Times analysis of the new California 
school scoring system, for example, cast doubt on the state's newly released 
school scores that had sent California parents rushing to find either private 
schools or realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times analysis found that the state didn't score enough tests in some 
districts to accurately gauge effectiveness of certain schools. Indeed, in some 
cases, school scores were based on a single student's test answers -- clearly a 
poor depiction of a school's value. And, a troubling fact for anyone who bought 
real estate with those scores in mind. After all, if that student drops out or 
graduates, the school's rating could plunge -- or soar -- overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, you generally only pay for private schools for a dozen years, while a 
bigger home mortgage may be financed over three decades. The calculation 
compensates for that somewhat by assuming higher-than-market interest rates. 
But, consumers who try to figure it out for themselves ought to be 
conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, how do you figure the break-even point? You need two things to 
start: The approximate cost of private school tuition and your marginal tax 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Private school tuition rates currently range from $2,000 to $10,000 annually, 
according to the "Handbook of Private Schools" published by Porter Sargent 
Publishers in Boston. Since that's too wide a range to get a reasonable 
estimate, you should call any private school you're interested in and check the 
tuition and fees. Also ask if the tuition is fairly steady or if it changes 
regularly. And, if you have more than one child, check whether the school 
offers family discounts. Many do. 
</P>
<P>
 Divide the annual tuition number by the inverse of your marginal tax rate. In 
other words, if you pay 30% of your income in state and federal taxes, divide 
the tuition by 70%, or .70. The result is how much you have to earn to pay the 
tuition. For example, if you're in the 30% tax bracket, to pay $4,000 in 
tuition you have to earn $5,714. 
</P>
<P>
 Take that result and, again, divide it by the inverse of your tax rate. In 
this example, the result would be $8,163, or $680 a month. You could pay that 
amount in deductible mortgage interest expenses and be on an even footing with 
someone in your same tax bracket who paid just $4,000 -- $333 a month -- in 
private school tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 How much more mortgage does that translate into? The answer depends on the 
length of the mortgage and the interest rate, but there's an old rule of thumb 
that says it costs $9 a month to service each $1,000 in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 So to find out how much debt you can handle with that $680 a month, you divide 
$680 by nine and multiply the result by $1,000. This individual could pay an 
extra $75,000 for a house and end up roughly even with the person who paid 
$4,000 annually for private schools.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: NO FAST WAY TO GET LOTTO WINNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. I know prizes in the California Super Lotto are paid out in 20 equal annual 
installments. May a winner sell his rights to collect those winnings to gain 
immediate cash? How do groups of winners collect their winnings? Does the 
lottery allow more than one individual to claim a portion of the prize? Or 
would the group have to set up a trust or corporation? How are taxes computed 
on group winners, and how are they paid? -- A.P . 
</P>
<P>
 A. All Super Lotto winnings, as well as Big Spin winnings in excess of $1 
million, are paid out in equal installments over 20 years from annuities and 
bonds the state purchases to cover its lottery obligations. State law specifies 
that the right to collect such long-term payments cannot be transferred or 
assigned to another person except in the event of death or a legal judgment 
such as divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 Players who pool their stakes and play as a group are paid their shares 
individually. Upon winning, each member of a group must complete a special form 
delineating the share he or she is due. To avoid conflict, state lottery 
officials recommend that people playing as a group firmly establish how any 
winnings will be split before the first bets are placed. The state has drafted 
a model agreement that is available by sending a self-addressed, stamped 
business envelope to the California Lottery Public Affairs Office, 600 N. 10th 
St., Sacramento, CA 95815. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal taxes -- California lottery winnings are not taxed by the state -- are 
deducted before winnings are paid. The state withholds 28% on behalf of the 
federal government; any additional tax must be paid by the winner. Don't Bail 
Out of Ginnie Mae Investment 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I have invested about half my savings in Ginnie Mae mutual funds operated 
by two separate national brokerages with good reputations. I am getting good 
returns and until recently my investments had even grown. However, now that 
interest rates are rising again, the value of my investments has dropped 
dramatically. Are they still safe? We are thinking of selling because we can't 
afford to lose our principal. -- R.L . 
</P>
<P>
 A. Be calm and stay put; the last thing you want to do when interest rates 
start to gyrate is panic. According to our financial planning experts, 
Government National Mortgage Assn. securities -- better known as Ginnie Maes -- 
are a fine choice for you. And the experts say you were wise to purchase these 
securities through a mutual fund with a strong track record. Still, there are a 
few points we should cover about them. 
</P>
<P>
 As you no doubt know, Ginnie Mae securities are invested in mortgages issued 
to homeowners by the nation's thrifts. These mortgages are collected in large 
pools, given the backing of the "full faith and credit" of the U.S. government, 
then resold to investors either directly or through mutual funds. On average, 
these bonds yield returns from 1% to 2% higher than U.S. Treasury notes and 
bonds. The government guarantees repayment of the principal but not payment of 
the interest -- although every effort is made to pay the interest, and it 
normally is.  
</P>
<P>
 But although the government guarantees the basic safety of your money, your 
investment is not completely predictable or fixed. When interest rates tumble, 
homeowners rush to refinance, and Ginnie Mae investors are paid off early. 
Although the initial maturity of Ginnie Maes extends 15 to 30 years, experts 
say investors should figure on a seven- to 10-year lifetime. This means 
investors often find that they get their money back sooner than expected and at 
a time when interest rates are lower than those they'd been getting from their 
Ginnie Maes. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the trading -- or secondary -- value of Ginnie Maes does not 
remain constant. When interest rates drop, the value of higher-paying mortgage 
pools rises. When rates rise, the value of a particular Ginnie Mae fund could 
fall.  
</P>
<P>
 But these fluctuations shouldn't affect you unless you are actively trading 
your Ginnie Maes. If you are merely holding them for the income, you should 
ignore the market gyrations. You haven't really "lost" any money in recent 
months because of rising interest rates any more than you "made" money over the 
last several years when interest rates fell.  
</P>
<P>
 What you had were paper gains you never realized. Now these gains have been 
eroded. Your principal is completely safe, and you have received -- and are 
highly likely to continue to receive -- your regular interest payments. It 
doesn't sound as if it's time for you to bail out, does it? Using 'Buy-Sell' to 
Divide Assets 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I own an apartment house 50-50 with a partner. I want to dissolve our 
partnership, but we can't sell the property in this market. I made my partner a 
"buy-sell" offer at a price I was willing to pay or accept, at his option. He 
says my approach isn't reasonable. Am I missing something? -- M.D.P . 
</P>
<P>
 A. Our experts say a "buy-sell" offer such as you have described is the 
standard, and perhaps the best, method for arriving at a mutually acceptable 
price when dividing or allocating assets. If you think about it, it makes 
sense: You are either willing to pay that price for your partner's share or 
accept it as payment for your own. (This is also used in splitting marital 
assets in a divorce.) 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, such an arrangement is specified in the initial partnership 
agreement as the method to be used if the partnership is terminated. However, 
you should not set your "buy-sell" price without some professional help; get at 
least one appraisal from a reputable professional. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is your partner balking? Perhaps he is trying to thwart the dissolution of 
your business relationship. Another possible scenario -- and one that shows a 
downside of the "buy-sell" method -- is that he cannot afford to buy your share 
at any price now and thinks you are offering too low a price for his.

DESIRE FOR FREEBIES SPAWNS INDUSTRY OF BOOKS, GUIDES, LISTS; GIVEAWAY: THE 
BIGGEST SOURCE OF GRATIS GOODIES IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, SAYS A PUBLISHER. 
SOURCES DO CHARGE FOR THEIR HELP.

<P>
 When Dr. Robert Spiegel decided to expand his decade-old practice, he did what 
banks, supermarkets, politicians and many others have done for years: He gave 
stuff away. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baltimore dentist mailed out 1,500 refrigerator magnets and gave free 
T-shirts to new patients and for referrals from existing ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great concept," said Spiegel, who added 75 families to his patient 
base over the past year. "They'll always think positive of you . . . and they 
(the giveaways) are a constant marketing tool since they have my name and phone 
number on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have patients who tell me their grandchildren are fighting over who gets to 
wear the T-shirts." 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal of consumer freebies is stronger than ever these days as Spiegel 
and many businesses and groups have discovered. The national recession may be 
over, but frugality lingers among people still struggling with layoffs, 
stagnant wages and a feeling that the American Dream may be slipping away. 
</P>
<P>
 The desire for freebies has spawned a multimillion-dollar industry of books, 
magazines, catalogues and newsletters that provide lists of free or nearly free 
items people can send away for. (The publications are not free, however.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The lists are enormous. . . . The problem is most people don't know what to 
ask for," said Matthew Lesko, who runs Information USA Inc. in Kensington, Md., 
which publishes dozens of books on free or low-cost offers. Among his latest: 
"1001 Free Goodies & Cheapies," which sells for $19.95. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've all been trained to buy things. When you and I have a problem, 
we think the only way out is to buy something -- a service or a product. It's 
such a shock when people see you can get it for free." 
</P>
<P>
 Lesko says the government is the biggest source of free information and 
services, although they are funded with taxpayer dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Many agencies do give out gobs of things for the asking. The White House, for 
example, will send greeting cards on request for special anniversaries and 
birthdays or to console grieving families. The Natural History Museum in 
Washington will provide free educational "Shark Kits," complete with books, 
videos and freeze-dried sharks. (Shipping is extra.) 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone else seems to have their own promotions as well: Cereal makers hide 
free toys among their breakfast kernels; supermarkets serve sample goodies to 
shoppers; lawyers advertise introductory consultations; big corporations give 
gifts to shareholders; and politicians circulate engraved pencils or coffee 
mugs. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a way of making oneself known, introducing a product, expanding business 
or just promoting good will. 
</P>
<P>
 But how much of what's out there is really gratis, or worth having? 
</P>
<P>
 Not a whole lot, if you ask Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the 
Consumer Federation of America in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is rarely a free lunch," Brobeck said. "Sellers offering free products 
or services at best will use your name for future marketing or sell it to other 
marketers, and at worst you will be subjected to bait-and-switch selling 
tactics in which you face enormous pressure to purchase a product." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas D. Walsh, an assistant attorney general with the Consumer Protection 
Division for Washington state, says he's all too familiar with complaints about 
health clubs offering trial memberships with intense verbal workouts from 
salespeople or travel companies that overcharge for accommodations while 
providing "free" air fare. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole concept of 'free' is fraught with the capacity to mislead a 
substantial number of consumers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some freebies are relatively harmless. There are the hats or bats given at 
baseball games, which most people know are included in overall ticket prices. 
There are the complimentary cosmetic-counter toiletries, which are really 
nicely packaged free samples that don't have a true retail value as claimed 
since they're never sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are not so harmless -- like the phony telemarketer who tries to steal 
credit card numbers with the promise of bogus prizes or products. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Trade Commission has strict guidelines against deceptive pricing, 
including what merchants can call "free." For example, conditional offers, such 
as buy-one-get-one-free deals, must be spelled out prior to a sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really have to ask yourself, 'Independent of this free offer, is this 
something I'd want to own?' " said Walsh, who is also co-author of "Getting 
Unscrewed and Staying That Way, The Sourcebook of Consumer Protection." 
</P>
<P>
 While many might not need or want them, the allure of freebies is often so 
irresistible that some people will pay money to find them. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Lansky, who runs the children's book publisher Meadowbrook Press in 
Deephaven, Minn., says his "Free Stuff For Kids" book, which costs $5, is 
consistently among his top three sellers, having sold nearly 4 million copies 
since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Stephens, owner of Publisher Inquiry Services in Boca Raton, Fla., 
which advertises shopping catalogues, says the most popular titles include 
"1001 Things You Can Get Free," and "Free Stuff From Uncle Sam," each costing 
$2. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies sponsoring giveaways have their own success stories. 
</P>
<P>
 About a year ago, Banc One Inc. in Austin, Tex., added $5 million in checking 
account deposits from University of Texas freshmen following an on-campus 
promotion that included free T-shirts and memo boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer Associates International Inc. in Islandia, N.Y., which recently gave 
out 1 million copies of personal finance software, says about half the takers 
continue to use the software and are likely to buy updated versions. 
</P>
<P>
 And Dr. Spiegel, the Baltimore dentist, says he expects to take on even more 
patients and recoup the $5,000 he spent on his promotion within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult to measure all the products or services that are given away. 
However, the Specialty Advertising Assn. International estimates 15,000 types 
of promotional products (the stuff with company logos on them) are handed out 
each year, with apparel and writing instruments leading the pack. It said $5.2 
billion in promotional products were sold to corporations or groups that gave 
them away. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the freebies have very little value, perhaps a few cents, or a few 
dollars for a shirt or cosmetics. Lesko admits that much of the giveaways are 
actually rubbish. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, there are bona fide freebies worth knowing about. 
</P>
<P>
 Eileen Langevin, of North Providence, R.I., learned through one of Lesko's 
books about a drug giveaway program in which several pharmaceutical companies 
participated. 
</P>
<P>
 The retired office manager, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, says the 
free drugs she received saved her $600 a month in prescription costs for about 
a year. She's now on public assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took my whole Social Security check to get my medicine and there was 
nothing left," Mrs. Langevin said. "It took a little perseverance . . . and a 
lot of letter writing" to get the medicine, "but it was worth it."

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; GREAT EXPECTATIONS; AS HEAD OF RLA, LINDA GRIEGO HAS 
DEFINITE IDEAS ABOUT GETTING THINGS DONE. STILL, SUPPORTERS SAY HER CHANCS OF 
MAKING A REAL DIFFERENCE WITH THE TROUBLE AGENCY ARE SLIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a long morning of nuts-and-bolts meetings, RLA President Linda Griego is 
running late for her noon appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Striding with the grace of a racehorse through an elegant Biltmore ballroom 
set for a luncheon, the lanky Los Angeles riot recovery czar stops momentarily 
for a handshake at the Catellus Development Corp. table, smooches from two 
attorneys at the Latham & Watkins table, and a succession of hugs from women in 
conservative business suits and a bearded man topped with a turban. 
</P>
<P>
 Griego has barely stopped smiling when a waiter plops down her lunch -- a hunk 
of salmon swimming in an unidentifiable beige sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do they have to do this to a nice piece of fish?" she says with a sigh, 
giving up after a single bite. "I like things simple." 
</P>
<P>
 An hour later, the architecture awards ceremony of the Los Angeles Conservancy 
is still droning on. Griego rises ("I never stay beyond 1:30 -- that's it. I've 
got to get back to work") and returns to her functional 8th Place office. After 
scanning her phone messages, she slips out the back door and through an alley 
festooned with razor-wire fencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Her destination? A Mexican food stand in the Downtown Carwash at Figueroa and 
Olympic where she orders the usual: a tostada sans guacamole and a Diet Pepsi. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now this ," she says, munching contentedly before heading off for yet another 
appointment in City Hall, "is good stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 For Griego, life sometimes seems a high-speed blur, with as many twists and 
turns as Madonna has had make-overs. 
</P>
<P>
 Small-town, Spanish-speaking youngster to Washington, D.C., Senate staffer; 
telephone company field crew supervisor to deputy mayor of Los Angeles; chili 
stand operator to Downtown restaurateur; mayoral candidate to newly appointed 
head of the much-maligned nonprofit assistance agency initially known as 
Rebuild L.A.  
</P>
<P>
 The few constants have been her dogged persistence, brimming optimism and keen 
ability to move with ease among the diverse worlds that make up the crazy-quilt 
megalopolis commonly referred to as Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very approachable and she doesn't have ego problems," says City 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. "She's a businesswoman who is guided by results, 
not by the assertion of power for the sake of exerting power." 
</P>
<P>
 Those qualities are sorely needed at RLA, which has had its own slew of 
make-overs since its inception as the city's primary response to the 1992 civil 
unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agency's first leader, 1984 Olympics chief and Orange County 
resident Peter Ueberroth, RLA focused on a single source of aid, corporate 
America, after government declined to dish out big-time financial help. 
Although major firms pledged several hundred million dollars for job training 
and other community-involvement efforts, Ueberroth, in a recession-racked 
economy, failed to persuade large corporations to create the tens of thousands 
of jobs needed to revitalize inner-city neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, RLA earned the reputation of being arrogant and out-of-touch with the 
long-neglected neighborhoods hit by the brunt of the fires, lootings and 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ueberroth stepped down last year, its four remaining co-chairs -- 
selected more on the basis of ethnic diversity than on their ability to run the 
agency in tandem -- concentrated on securing money for small- and medium-size 
businesses. But the quartet of bosses, since departed, stumbled over each 
other. Today, one lending fund has yet to be launched and a second, now 
operating independently, has distributed only a handful of loans. 
</P>
<P>
 As RLA teetered on the brink of oblivion, Griego and Arco Chief Executive 
Officer Lodwrick M. Cook agreed in February to come to the rescue, he as 
voluntary chairman and she as a hands-on, $150,000-a-year, seven-day-a-week 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 For the ambitious Griego, it was a relatively swift return to the public 
spotlight after her unsuccessful run for mayor. She won only 7% of the vote 
last spring but finished a respectable fifth among 24 candidates. And she will 
long be remembered in local political circles for her TV ad, a striking example 
of niche marketing: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty hard to change things when you're just like all the other guys at 
City Hall," Griego, in a bright red jacket, declared as she walked amid a sea 
of black-and-white cardboard cutouts of her male opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months into her new job, Griego, who is noncommittal about a second run 
for mayor, has given the floundering agency a new sense of life. 
</P>
<P>
 On a typical afternoon this month, she ran the gamut of Los Angeles public 
life, speaking to the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce board of directors 
in their wood-paneled meeting room and accepting a public service award from 
the Central American Resource Center (CARACEN), a Latino immigrants rights 
group. Also sandwiched in was an interview in Beverly Hills with a corporate 
RLA volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are only a handful of individuals who can bridge a lot of the gaps 
between different parts of a city," says First Interstate Bank President Bruce 
Willison. "Linda has the confidence and respect of the business community, both 
large and small. She empathizes with the segment of our community looking for 
RLA to assist them and the city in rebuilding and enhancing our socioeconomic 
conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Griego does not have the same long-term roots in the city's Latino 
neighborhoods as such top elected officials as Gloria Molina. She is friendly 
with the owners of the chi-chi Patina restaurant on Melrose Avenue, for 
example, but has never visited the blue-collar mercado shopping and restaurant 
complex on the Eastside. Still, Latino community leaders know her and see her 
as an ally. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's built bridges between the community, grass-roots groups and people in 
the corporate world and does a real good job by being honest about it to boot," 
says Roberto Lovato, executive director of CARACEN. "Sometimes when you are a 
bridge-builder you end up becoming one side of the bridge and disconnecting the 
other. Linda has kept up both parts." 
</P>
<P>
 Griego's foremost goal at RLA is to help small businesses expand their markets 
and create jobs. To do that, she plans to establish voluntary networks linking 
groups of up to 20 firms that manufacture the same type of commodities, such as 
textiles, electronics parts and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 She has also begun reaching out to the more than 300 property owners whose 
lots remain empty and weed-strewn since burning in the riots. Eventually, 
Griego hopes to get them tax breaks or financing to help them rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 Such strategies play directly to Griego's strengths as a successful small 
businesswoman, most notably as co-developer of Engine Co. No. 28, a posh and 
popular restaurant she owns with several investors in a carefully restored 1912 
Renaissance Revival structure Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet they also represent a giant step back from RLA's original mission of 
turning around the living conditions in Los Angeles' poorest neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It probably is a lowering of expectations. It's more of a pragmatic, 
realistic approach," Griego acknowledges. "But to me, a lot of small changes 
equal one big change." 
</P>
<P>
 At this early stage, she has had few successes. And despite her exuberance and 
vast network of contacts, it's unclear whether Griego has the herculean 
management skills and support required to make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "From restaurateur to deputy mayor to RLA president makes an interesting 
profile," says a former co-worker in the Bradley Administration who requested 
anonymity. "But you have to ask, besides putting together a menu with meatloaf 
on it, what do you have to say for yourself? When it came to governance, I 
don't think she cast a long shadow from City Hall." 
</P>
<P>
 With the riots a receding memory, even Griego's strongest boosters predict 
that her impact will be limited. 
</P>
<P>
 But that won't hurt her career, they add. The RLA post is a no-lose situation, 
they say, offering Griego a platform from which to further her reputation as a 
consensus builder in a city whose demographics are becoming increasingly 
Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 "This job gives her publicity, without many expectations, while providing her 
with a chance to hone her public-speaking skills," says Dan Garcia, a former 
city police and planning commissioner. "She's intelligent and she listens. 
She's not somebody who's easily deterred from her mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "And she doesn't carry her ethnicity on her sleeve like a lot of politicians 
who use it as a knife." 
</P>
<P>
 It's six hours after the Conservancy lunch, and salmon is once again on the 
menu. This time, though, Griego is pleased. The fish has been prepared simply, 
and tastefully, on an outdoor grill by her husband, Ron Peterson, a Downtown 
business lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The leisurely dinner is complemented by an 180-degree view of Los Angeles from 
the living room of their Baldwin Hills abode, a bold cinder-block-and-glass 
structure built at the edge of a cliff in 1957 by Southern California Institute 
of Architecture founder Ray Kappe. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about ethnic diversity. Griego, a Latina, and Peterson, an Anglo, have 
lived for the better part of two decades in a largely African American 
neighborhood above the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza. The exquisitely furnished 
house, designed by a leading proponent of the stark, angular International 
style of architecture, has a distinctly Japanese feel. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime friends say the ethnic eclecticism has wider meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 "She makes a real statement in terms of her willingness to be part of the 
community -- it predates any political interests or motivations," says Brenda 
Shockley, who heads Community Build, a rival post-riot economic recovery agency 
founded by Rep. Maxine Waters. "Of course, she also has a great home." 
</P>
<P>
 The sparkling house on a hill is a long way from Griego's modest origins in 
the rolling ranch lands of New Mexico, three hours east of Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
 She was born in Tucamcari in 1947 and raised by her grandparents, whom she 
refers to as her father and mother. He was a railroad worker and she a baker. 
Her biological mother lived there too, and Griego looked upon her as an older 
sister. The situation never seemed awkward to her and was not unusual in her 
town, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, growing up as the youngest of seven in her grandparents' home, rather 
than as the eldest in her mother's fledgling household, gave her a grown-up 
perspective at an early age, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're living with older family members, you're treated like an adult by 
the time you're 7 years old. You sit at a dinner table where your brothers and 
sisters discuss politics, or if they are looking for a job, you're privy to all 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of her relatives and childhood friends remain in tiny Tucamcari, but 
Griego, who learned English in the first grade, had a hankering to explore the 
world beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 She attributes her wanderlust to a love of reading and to the feisty spirit of 
her grandmother, now 85. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was young, I remember her buying a car even before she was able to 
drive," Griego recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Years later, Griego jokingly reminded her grandmother of that incident when 
she asked Linda, an inexperienced cook, why she planned to open a 
restaurant-food market, the Chili Stop, in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I answered, 'Remember that car you once bought?' says Griego, whose specialty 
at the family bakery was slicing and wrapping. 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing high school in 1967, Griego moved to Washington, D.C., to work 
as a clerk for her hometown congressman, Democratic Rep. Thomas Morris. She got 
the job through an old grade-school teacher, Morris' wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting off loneliness, Griego grew to relish the big-city lifestyle. When 
Morris was defeated in 1969, she joined the staff of newly elected California 
Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston. There, she met Peterson, a summer intern from 
Yale Law School; they married a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 After a late honeymoon spent camping for five months in the wilds of East 
Africa ("My mother still doesn't understand that one," Griego says), where they 
had close brushes with elephants and wart hogs, the couple moved to Los 
Angeles. Griego continued working for Cranston while attending college at 
Pomona and UCLA. Nine years after beginning school part time, she received her 
bachelor's degree in history from UCLA in 1975, becoming the first member of 
her family to graduate from either high school or college. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, she took a job as a telephone company field supervisor after being 
challenged by a phone company executive who belittled the blue-collar skills of 
women. Griego occasionally climbed telephone poles and wrestled, verbally, with 
chauvinist customers who refused to have equipment installed by a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chili Stop, which lasted a couple of years, was next. Then, a short-lived 
enterprise operating outdoor flower stands Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a tremendous amount of rewards, both the businesses that don't make 
it and the ones that do," she says. "If you knew all the things you'd run into 
in opening one, you wouldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 To establish her next enterprise, Engine Co. No. 28, Griego got a contractor's 
license and scrapped successfully for more than 50 city zoning variances. 
Although she rarely has time to eat at the restaurant -- never mind run it -- 
she remains a general managing partner. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, after serving on a few city boards (and a less successful fling with 
an Engine Co. spinoff in West Hollywood), Griego was appointed by Bradley as 
deputy mayor in charge of economic development. The riot occurred several 
months later, and much of her time was spent monitoring the meager flow of 
money from Washington and assisting individual business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think anybody who was here during that period of time would feel less than 
satisfied about the way things went," Yaroslavsky says. "Not only Linda, but 
the city got overwhelmed by the problems caused by the riots." 
</P>
<P>
 With RLA's start-up momentum long depleted, Griego is much like a salmon 
swimming upstream as she seeks to produce significant results before RLA's 
scheduled shutdown in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet if anything, she stresses, she is a tenacious soul. Or, as her husband 
jokes, stubborn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was concerned if this agency was closed down (this year), it would have 
been very bad symbolism for the city," says Griego, seated in a long, narrow 
office brightened by a pair of framed South American tapestries and an antique 
hotel reception desk she purchased at an auction. "I think about being a 
longtime resident, and what I experienced two years ago driving through all 
that smoke, and feeling in the bottom of my stomach, 'My God, how can this be 
happening?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I just really feel you can't continue to ignore the systemic problems. No one 
is going to solve them for us. It has to come from the people who live here." 
</P>
<P>
 Griego has taken firm charge of the financially shaky agency in recent weeks, 
slashing its paid staff in half to 15 people -- mainly minority women -- and 
hiring several consultants to help with her plans to establish small-business 
consortiums. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, she has kept the $150,000 salary that was approved by RLA's 
corporate executive-dominated board. Her pay is far higher than that of heads 
of comparably sized nonprofit corporations. The figure has been privately 
questioned by some community leaders, but Griego says she has received no 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 On many days, Griego serves as a one-stop ombudsman, the host of a sort of 
"Tell It to Linda," as business people share their plans and woes. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent afternoon, she met with the owner of a riot-torched Figueroa Street 
strip mall and with a young real estate developer researching a project whereby 
he would make a living by building affordable housing units for homeless 
veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 Griego called the bank that holds the strip-mall owner's mortgage to stave off 
a foreclosure sale for at least a month. She asked the developer to keep in 
touch if he makes any progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Griego later explained that RLA chairman Cook had asked her to meet with the 
developer, whom she believed to be well beyond the vision stage. 
</P>
<P>
 At this stage in her tenure, miscommunication and missteps are not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 To explore methods for assisting the sidewalk vendors who peddle food and 
clothing near MacArthur Park, Griego recently toured downtown Santa Ana. Not 
until she was en route to Orange County did she learn that the carts there are 
operated by merchants from adjacent shops. The MacArthur Park vendors in 
Westlake, on the other hand, work independently in a setup that many shop 
owners strongly oppose. 
</P>
<P>
 The $150,000 park RLA is building on the grounds of East Los Angeles College 
is another example. 
</P>
<P>
 When Griego arrived at RLA, the campus green space was on a list of 
unfulfilled commitments, so she asked capable RLA project manager Virginia 
Oaxaca to get it constructed as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 What Griego didn't know -- and did not learn until she heard a progress report 
from the college's acting president at an RLA board meeting -- was that the 
park had first been promised a decade earlier by Ueberroth's Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The project symbolizes Griego's ability to get things done. But it also raises 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, with the myriad problems in South-Central Los Angeles, Pico-Union and 
other high-intensity riot zones, would RLA invest its limited funds and 
woman-hours to plant sod and ivy miles away in Monterey Park? 
</P>
<P>
 "The correlation I see," says Griego in her characteristically unflustered 
fashion, "is that community colleges are very important to us. . . . It's who 
they educate here who goes to work in the small and medium-size businesses we 
want to help." 
</P>
<P>
 With the park nearing completion, Griego is making a visit to East Los Angeles 
College at the invitation of its acting president, Ernest Moreno. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving east on the 10 freeway with two associates, the RLA president learns 
that Moreno plans to pitch her about joining the board of a foundation he wants 
to jump-start. 
</P>
<P>
 After half an hour of waxing eloquent about the college's illustrious alumni 
and pressing needs, Moreno springs the request. 
</P>
<P>
 Griego listens intently, letting him finish his sales talk before tactfully 
responding that she is overbooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get spread very thin," says Griego, who is already a director of 
organizations ranging from KCET to Scripps College to the Los Angeles 
Conservancy to First Interstate Bank. "I don't want to go on a board just to 
put my name on a board. 
</P>
<P>
 "(But) I can help you in two ways," she adds. "I would not mind acting as an 
adviser to the board. And I can provide you with a list of maybe half a dozen 
names of people who I think would be interested in serving. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's great," interrupts Moreno. "That's music to my ears." 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, you have to do a little arm-twisting sometimes," Griego continues. 
"But I think that you could get this foundation off the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 On her way out a few minutes later, Griego is asked whom she might include on 
the list of potential directors. "Ueberroth," she replies with a smile. "He's 
not off the hook yet. It's not over until it's over." Linda Griego 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 46. 
</P>
<P>
 Native: No. Born in Tucamcari, N.M., lives in Baldwin Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Family: Married to attorney Ron Peterson; no children ("It just never 
happened," Griego says). 
</P>
<P>
 Interests: Traveling to such far-flung destinations as East Africa and Nepal. 
</P>
<P>
 On being raised the youngest of seven children: "When you're living with older 
family members, you're treated like an adult by the time you're 7 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 On starting a small business: "If you knew all the things you'd run into in 
opening one, you wouldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 On redefining the goals of RLA: "It probably is a lowering of expectations. . 
. . But to me, a lot of small changes equal one big change." 
</P>
<P>
 On maintaining myriad directorships on boards citywide: "I get spread very 
thin."

VILLA TERMINI; TERMITES ARE TREATED TO DINNER 'ON THE HOUSE' AS PART OF UC 
BERKELEY STUDY OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ALTERNATIVE EXTERMINATION METHODS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. J. DIAMOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Diamond is a Los Angeles free-lance 
writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ah, these Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 First they take some prime real estate in the San Francisco Bay area. Then 
they build a custom home. And then they give it to . . . termites? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the house wasn't exactly a gift. It was part of a scientific experiment 
on the UC Berkeley campus. The termites were placed in the house in waves, and 
each wave was attacked by a different method of extermination -- heat, cold, 
electric shock, microwave, fumigants -- to see which works best. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers dubbed the house "Villa Termiti." 
</P>
<P>
 Cute idea, and a real media draw. When the first body counts were announced 
two months ago by the co-investigators at Berkeley and the U.S. Forest Service, 
reporters rushed  
</P>
<P>
 to the battlefield -- even CNN, as everyone involved likes to point out. 
</P>
<P>
 The war was such fun, the conclusions were almost buried. The data proved that 
nontoxic "alternative" methods can kill drywood termites. But it also showed 
that for a real no-survivors, no-escape victory, nothing beats, or even equals, 
whole-house fumigation. 
</P>
<P>
 After the media blitz, California homeowners swamped Berkeley's extension 
office with requests for more information on the experiment. "I love my work 
but given the demands and the lack of resources, the attention has gotten to be 
a drag," said entomologist Vernard Lewis, Ph.D., one of the principal 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 The interest is understandable. Drywood termites are a big problem in 
California. Each year, Californians spend an estimated $300 million to $400 
million to fight termites, most of it on drywood rather than subterranean 
termites. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was undertaken, Lewis said, to try to answer the questions of both 
consumers and the industry about the effectiveness of alternative termite 
treatment methods as well as traditional fumigation techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors of alternative methods have been marketing nontoxic treatments -- 
freezing termites right in the walls with liquid nitrogen, roasting them, 
zapping them with "Electro-Guns." These are appealing because they seem 
environmentally benign, impressively high-tech and there's no telltale Baggie 
over the house advertising the presence of termites and the absence of 
occupants. 
</P>
<P>
 But do the alternatives really work? The consumer can't tell. The only visible 
evidence of live termites is little piles of droppings; there's no evidence of 
termite death. 
</P>
<P>
 The study of alternative methods includes projects at both UC Berkeley and UC 
Riverside. It is funded by grants from the state's Structural Pest Control 
Board and donations from the pest control industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pest control operators need to have as many tools available to them as 
possible, because people may have a real or perceived objection to pesticides," 
said Harvey Logan, executive vice president of the Sacramento-based Pest 
Control Operators of California. "We hoped the study would show alternative 
methods safe and effective, that they worked." 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Termiti, built at Berkeley's Forest Products Lab, is really only a 
20-by-20 foot room (the size of a two-car garage) finished in gray stucco with 
a green shingle gabled roof. 
</P>
<P>
 The villa has four identical sides, each with a door and windows, and an attic 
and crawl space. It has no insulation, no pipes, no heat and the main room is 
just drywall over framing. (The drywall has already had to be replaced three 
times over the months of testing.) 
</P>
<P>
 The house was ready for occupancy last August, but the termites weren't just 
ushered in and allowed to choose their own rooms. They were hand-placed in 
Douglas fir boards that were divided into three "galleries" with 25 termites in 
each gallery, for a total of 75 termites per board. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Lewis said, the boards "were randomly placed in the villa. The studs 
were exposed, the boards were affixed to the studs and the drywall was put 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 The villa was treated 11 times with six drywood termite eradication methods -- 
two fumigants, heat, liquid nitrogen, microwave and electrogun. Pest control 
operators specializing in each method performed the treatment, with the 
exception of the liquid nitrogen method, which researchers applied because 
Tallon Termite & Pest Control, whose Blizzard System advertises that "We freeze 
their little buns off," refused to participate in the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the six methods were full-house treatments, involving 48 boards (and 
3,600 termites) -- 12 in the attic, 24 behind the drywall, 12 in the sub-area. 
The microwave people couldn't do the sub-area, and the liquid nitrogen was put 
only into the walls. In all cases, the boards were pulled out and the survivors 
counted within a couple of days and carefully put aside, Lewis said, because 
"if you leave them too long, the ants find them." 
</P>
<P>
 The results: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sulfuryl fluoride ("Vikane"), a fumigant gas injected into the tarp-wrapped 
villa: No termites survived, no damage to structure. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Synergized methyl bromide ("MAKR"), a fumigant gas cut by carbon dioxide 
and injected into the tarp-wrapped villa: No termites survived, no damage to 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Heat, in which propane heaters in the tarp-wrapped villa raised the 
internal temperature of the wood to 120 degrees (and the room air to 187 
degrees): About 35, or 1% of the 3,600 termites survived, those closest to the 
concrete foundation. Minor warping of some boards. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Liquid nitrogen (292 degrees below zero), sprayed into the wall voids of 
the villa's main room: No termites survived. Minor warping of drywall panels. 
Holes drilled into the drywall for the procedure required repair. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Microwave, over 500 watts, administered through a funneled device the size 
of a toaster oven set on a tripod close to the wall. Almost 8% of termites 
survived. Some boards severely burned.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Electric shock, administered by electrogun through pinholes drilled in the 
drywall: About 50% of the termites survived, but another 30% expired over the 
next several weeks. Pinholes in the drywall required repair.  
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is obviously that (all methods) kill insects," Lewis said. 
"But if you're looking for 100%, some fall short, and in the field, they 
probably fall shorter yet. If you want 100%, you're in the chemical area." 
</P>
<P>
 Spot treatment might be good enough, but only if all the spots of infestation 
are located, which can be difficult. The UC researchers used acoustic detection 
equipment not yet commercially available to pick up signals that humans can't 
hear -- in this case, the sound of wood fibers being torn by tiny mandibles. 
"If the industry had the tools I have, maybe they could use spot techniques," 
Lewis said. "And still, if I picked up termites in three or four different 
areas of a house, I'd fumigate." 
</P>
<P>
 At least, he added, "I now have data that says: first, if you treat for 
termites, treatment methods are not always 100%, but second, even with the 
Electro-Gun, 80% are killed. Given all that, someone (who is) chemical-phobic 
could make a decision." 
</P>
<P>
 The industry reaction to the news from Villa Termiti was mixed. Jay Tallon, 
owner of Tallon Termite, although "tickled pink by the conclusions," criticizes 
both procedure and results. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people didn't have the foggiest notion of how much (nitrogen) to use," 
he said, having refused to give them the information. And he thinks the 
conclusion bears out his suspicion that the purpose was "to come out and (show) 
fumigation still the best way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pest Control Operators' announcement of the results ("Some Non-Chemical 
Termite Treatments May Fall Short in Their Claims, Study Finds") seems to 
support his assertion. But, Logan said, it was "intended to be realistic, not 
negative." The association considers the study "somewhat encouraging," but 
"basically a laboratory experiment, using more of the (alternative) product 
than what's used in the field." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is support in the industry for the nontoxic techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 "The industry would accept the fact that all alternative methods are effective 
spot treatments," said Carl Doucette, vice president of American City Pest 
Control in Lawndale and an industry member of California's Structural Pest 
Control Board. "The problem is they guarantee the whole house." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, there aren't many vendors using alternative methods. 
</P>
<P>
 While Villa Termiti was being alternately infested and attacked, researchers 
at UC Riverside examined 20,000 termite inspection reports filed in three 
Southern California counties. They found that nontoxic alternatives were used 
in fewer than 10% of termite control jobs. Most consumers stick to conventional 
methods -- either spot treatments with chemicals or whole-house fumigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Villa Termiti study isn't definitive, but it's a first and a useful step, 
the researchers said. The public response to it certainly proves that the 
question of drywood termite treatments in general and alternative methods in 
particular is of wide interest. Further study is needed, Lewis said, with more 
resources and more manpower, so he and his fellow entomologists can get off the 
phones and back to work.

HOT PROPERTY: HE'S ANCHORED IN THE VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FRED ROGGIN, host of the syndicated "Roggin's Heroes" sports blooper show and 
an Emmy-winning sportscaster at KNBC Channel 4, and his wife, Richel, have 
purchased a four-bedroom home in Sherman Oaks for close to the $595,000 asking 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 Roggin, 37, hosted two "Top Secret Television" specials for NBC last year, 
featuring clips from unusual TV programs around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 A KNBC sportscaster since 1980, Roggin anchors four sportscasts a day during 
the week and hosts the Emmy-winning Sunday Nights Sports, also on Channel 4. He 
made an appearance last year on the NBC show "Blossom" and had a cameo role in 
the NBC movie "Witness to the Execution," which aired in February. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our first permanent home together," he said of the Sherman Oaks 
residence. "I couldn't be happier." 
</P>
<P>
 The Roggins, who were married in April of last year, bought a smaller house in 
Studio City shortly after their wedding, but they regarded that as a temporary 
abode, which they've leased out now that they've moved into their new home. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in the early 1960s, the Roggins' new home was extensively updated by its 
former owners, a retired couple who moved to the La Costa area. The 
3,200-square-foot home has a Valley-lights view; pool, spa and yard, designed 
for entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roggins' former home has three bedrooms and a game room in 2,500 square 
feet. It was leased to Steve Levesque, a music publicist who has represented 
such stars as Paul Anka, Carol Channing and James Brown. Levesque works for 
veteran Hollywood publicist Lee Solters. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Underwood of Fred Sands' Sherman Oaks office represented the Roggins in 
their purchase and lease. Diana Liekus, at the same realty office, represented 
Levesque. 
</P>
<P>
 Def Leppard bassist RICK SAVAGE has put his condo overlooking Beverly Hills on 
the market at $549,000, furnished. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Savage and four other British teen-agers got together to make music 17 
years ago, their "light-metal" band suffered the death of its original 
guitarist, Steve Clark, and the loss of drummer Rick Allen's left arm in a 
serious car accident. Allen relearned to play the drums using one arm and his 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The band last appeared in Los Angeles 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're in Ireland and don't spend enough time here to merit having the 
condominium," said listing broker Elaine Young of Coldwell Banker, Beverly 
Hills, who shares the listing with Paul Czako, of the same realty firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The condo, which Savage bought in 1988, has two bedrooms in almost 1,700 
square feet. It's in a 32-story building with vast city views. The 146-unit, 
nearly 30-year-old building is where actor George Hamilton bought a condo in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor JOHN C. McGINLEY -- who appears in the 1994 films "Surviving the Game," 
"On Deadly Ground," "Mother's Boys," "Car 54, Where Are You?" and the upcoming 
"Wagons East," the late John Candy's comedy Western -- has purchased a 
three-bedroom home with ocean and canyon views in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 McGinley, who began his film career with appearances in "Platoon" (1986) and 
"Wall Street" (1987), bought a two-story traditional on a bit more than an acre 
for close to its last asking price of $729,000, sources say. Built in 1986, the 
house originally had been priced at nearly $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk Murray and Chris Frost of Jim Rapf & Associates in Malibu represented 
McGinley in the purchase, and Jay Rubenstein, of the same firm, represented the 
seller, described as a home builder. McGinley had been renting a Malibu 
apartment for the past four years, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 THOMAS CALABRO, who plays the lying, womanizing louse Michael Mancini in 
"Melrose Place," and his actress wife, Liz, have moved into a Studio City home 
that they purchased for $300,000, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional-style, 2,000-square-foot residence, built in the 1950s, had 
been listed by Nicki Marcellino of Prudential California, Sherman Oaks, who 
also represented the Calabros. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAUDIA CHRISTIAN, who stars as the icy brunette Commander Susan Ivanova in 
the sci-fi TV series "Babylon 5," and her husband, Rod Dyer, a graphic designer 
in the film industry and a restaurateur (Pane e Vino on the Westside), have 
leased a Bel-Air home for close to its monthly asking price of $7,500, 
furnished, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-bedroom, 3,200-square-foot home has a woodsy yard and a wine cellar 
built into a hill. Cecelia Waeschle, Rodeo Realty in Beverly Hills, had the 
listing, and Phillip Spalding, of the firm's Brentwood office, represented 
Christian and Dyer.

CONDO Q&A: NEW LAW AFFECTS HOW ASSOCIATIONS SETTLE DISPUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Hickenbottom is a past president of 
the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the Community Associations Institute (CAI), 
a national nonprofit research and educational organization. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: My friend owns a home in a planned development in Santa Clarita. Her 
homeowners' association sent a letter to all owners about a new law that 
requires alternative dispute resolution. The letter said that all associations 
are supposed to inform their homeowners of the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 I own a condominium unit in Sherman Oaks. I have not received any notification 
from my association yet. Is my association in violation of the law? Please 
explain alternative dispute resolution. In what situations must the association 
use it? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: The new law went into effect Jan. 1. It amends California Civil Code, 
Section 1354, which explains that an association's declaration may be enforced 
by any owner, or the association, or both. 
</P>
<P>
 Your association should send notification to all members. The law states that 
all community associations are required to send a summary of the law to all 
owners annually. The summary can be included in a newsletter or other written 
communication, or it can be mailed along with the pro forma budget information 
that is sent out prior to the beginning of the association's fiscal year. (For 
a summary of the law, see story, K6.) 
</P>
<P>
 Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) is the term for several conflict 
settlement processes that can be used before or instead of going to court. The 
new law requires that the two parties in a disagreement try to resolve the 
conflict through mediation or arbitration prior to commencing a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The law specifies that ADR is not necessary when an association is attempting 
to collect delinquent assessments from an owner. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there are other situations that may not require ADR before 
obtaining an injunction or other forms of legal action. For instance, if an 
owner is in the process of violating an architectural restriction by building a 
pool without permission, the association is allowed to take legal action to 
immediately halt the construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new law applies only to two types of disputes regarding the association's 
governing documents, which include the declaration of covenants, conditions and 
restrictions (CC&Rs), bylaws, articles of incorporation, and rules and 
regulations," said attorney Herbert Strickstein, a Century City lawyer with 
more than 30 years of experience in community association law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first type of case is 'declaratory relief.' In this type of case, a party 
is asking the court to declare or interpret the parties' rights and obligations 
under one or more of the governing documents. For example, an owner may want to 
ask the court who has the responsibility for maintaining a balcony, patio, 
windows or doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The second type of case is 'injunctive relief.' For instance, a party (the 
association) is asking the court to order the other party (a homeowner) to do 
something, or to stop doing something. Examples would be an order that a 
homeowner stop parking in guest parking spaces, or an order that the 
association fix a leaking roof. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either type of case may also include a claim for money damages as long as it 
does not exceed $5,000. The new law does not apply to cases that seek only 
money damages." 
</P>
<P>
 The ADR procedure begins when one of the parties in the dispute gives the 
other party a "Request for Resolution" form. By signing the form, the parties 
agree to submit the dispute to mediation or arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 James P. Lingl, a Camarillo attorney who is active in community association 
legislation and the representation of community association clients, said the 
"Request for Resolution" must include a brief description of the dispute, a 
request for mediation or arbitration and a notice that the party receiving the 
request form has 30 days to respond to the request, or the request is deemed to 
be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "The request for resolution is to be served in the same way that a small 
claims action is to be served," Lingl said. "If both parties to the dispute 
agree to use ADR, it should be completed within 90 days, unless both parties 
agree in writing to conclude the ADR at a later date. The costs of the ADR will 
be divided between the parties." 
</P>
<P>
 Strickstein said that refusing arbitration or mediation does carry a risk. If 
the court awards attorneys' fees and costs, it may consider a party's refusal 
to arbitrate or mediate when deciding the amounts to be awarded. A party might 
be required to pay more attorney's fees if that party does not agree to 
arbitration or mediation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mediation and arbitration are two distinctly different procedures. The two 
parties involved in a dispute might be inclined to choose arbitration rather 
than mediation depending upon the nature of the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 What is arbitration? 
</P>
<P>
 When arbitration is used, the two parties present their testimony to an 
arbitrator, a third party who hears both sides of the argument and then renders 
a judgment. Arbitration can be binding or non-binding. 
</P>
<P>
 What is mediation? 
</P>
<P>
 Mediation uses a mediator, a third party, who listens to both sides and 
encourages open discussion between the parties about the reasons for the 
conflict. The mediator ensures the active participation of both parties by 
facilitating the communication, thereby assisting the two parties in exploring 
various ways to resolve the problem. The two parties then agree to a solution 
that they have helped to shape. 
</P>
<P>
 In community associations, the two parties involved in the conflict are often 
neighbors who will continue to live in the association after the conflict is 
resolved. Therefore, all parties should be interested in preserving a friendly 
atmosphere by using a constructive approach to resolve problems. Having served 
as a mediator on many occasions, I am convinced that mediation promotes the 
healing of bruised egos and combative attitudes of the two parties. After using 
mediation, the association is then better equipped to handle future problems. 
</P>
<P>
 ADR can save the association member's time, energy and money by resolving 
problems quickly and efficiently without going to court. The new requirement to 
attempt to mediate or arbitrate will have a positive impact on the workload of 
the court system. In addition, effective conflict resolution promotes a 
cooperative attitude among all of the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Litigation, on the other hand, is often expensive, creates dissension among 
the owners, and takes a great deal of time and energy that could be used in 
more constructive ways. Litigation is often stressful to the participants and, 
in some cases, interferes with the owner's ability to sell or the buyer's 
ability to obtain a mortgage loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Who is responsible for finding a mediator or arbitrator? 
</P>
<P>
 The person or persons who initiate the request for resolution form are usually 
the ones who find the mediator or arbitrator and engage the services on behalf 
of both parties. Since both parties share the cost, either party can suggest a 
mediator or arbitrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Where does one find a mediation or arbitration service? 
</P>
<P>
 There are several services, such as HomeOwners Arbitration and Mediation 
Services (HOAMS), that specialize in community association dispute resolution. 
HOAMS was formed as a joint enterprise of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation 
Services (JAMS), and Kate M. Rinaldi & Associates, a law and mediation firm. 
HOAMS was formed specifically in response to the new requirements of Civil Code 
1354.  
</P>
<P>
 "We contact all of the parties and coordinate the time and place for the 
hearing," said attorney Kate Rinaldi, president of HOAMS. "Our mediators are 
seasoned professionals who have years of mediation experience as well as 
specialized training in homeowner association matters." HOAMS can be reached by 
calling (800) ADR-1354. 
</P>
<P>
 Lingl said, "In addition to the ADR services that have personnel trained in 
community association disputes, each county has a low cost/no cost ADR service 
that is partially funded by court filing fees, such as Dispute Resolution 
Services in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Lingl has trained some of their mediators to provide them with information 
about the large body of law that governs community associations. Dispute 
Resolution Services can be reached at (213) 896-6526. Callers will be referred 
to one of several branch offices in Pasadena, South Bay, Lakewood, Santa Monica 
or East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Another way to find mediators is to call the Southern California Mediation 
Assn. at (213) 896-6540. The association maintains a referral service. Callers 
can request a mediator with specific experience and training. Dispute Workshop 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Kate Rinaldi, president of HomeOwners Arbitration and Mediation 
Services (HOAMS), will conduct a workshop on alternative dispute resolution for 
community association managers from 8:15 a.m. to noon June 17 at the Hyatt 
Regency Hotel in Irvine. Managers will learn how to help their association 
boards of directors comply with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop is being presented by the California Assn. of Community Managers 
(CACM). Managers can call CACM at (714) 476-4542 for more information. Here's 
the Law: Clip 'n' Save 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Neuland, an attorney with Hickey & Neuland, an Orange County law firm 
specializing in community association law since 1970, has prepared the 
following summary of the law, which can be used for distribution to association 
members. Associations must distribute a summary to their members each year.  
</P>
<P>
 Summary of Civil Code Section 1354 
</P>
<P>
 Effective Jan. 1, 1994, the California Civil Code, Section 1354, was amended 
to enact "Alternative Dispute Resolution" (ADR) procedures. The law requires 
that before a common interest development (homeowners association) or an 
individual homeowner files a lawsuit against the other, solely for declaratory 
relief or injunctive relief in connection with a claim for money, under $5,000 
(other than association assessments) or for enforcing the association's 
governing documents, the filing party "shall endeavor" to submit the dispute to 
alternative dispute resolution. Forms of ADR include mediation, negotiation and 
arbitration and may be binding or non-binding. 
</P>
<P>
 The ADR process is initiated by one party serving a "Request for Resolution" 
form upon the other party to the dispute. The form must include (1) a brief 
description of the dispute, (2) the request for ADR, (3) a notice that a 
response must be received within thirty (30) days or it will be deemed 
rejected, and (4) a copy of Civil Code Section 1354. Service of the Request for 
Resolution should be by personal service or Small Claims Court procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 If the individual receiving the request form agrees to ADR, the ADR process 
must be completed within ninety (90) days unless otherwise extended by the 
agreement. The cost of the ADR process is to be paid by the participating 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time a civil suit is begun by the filing of a Complaint, the filing 
party must also submit to the Court a Certificate of Compliance indicating that 
they have complied with the requirements of Civil Code, Section 1354, or 
stating any excuse for not doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 If no Certificate is filed, it may be grounds for challenging the suit. Proper 
excuses include (1) a party refused ADR, (2) that fast injunctive relief is 
necessary, (3) the right to bring suit will expire within 120 days following 
the filing of the action, or (4) dismissal of the suit would harm the filing 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil Code, Section 1354, also allows the Court to send a lawsuit to ADR upon 
agreement of the parties. The procedures and requirements of the law do not 
apply to the filing of cross-complaints. Failure by any member of the 
association to comply with the pre-filing requirements of Section 1354 may 
result in the loss of the rights to sue the association or another member of 
the association regarding enforcement of the governing documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the winning party shall be awarded reasonable attorney's fees and 
costs, the Court may consider a party's refusal to participate in ADR prior to 
starting the suit. Unless the two parties agree to the disclosure, evidence 
made and documents prepared for the ADR process are not admissible in a later 
civil action.

YOUR MORTGAGE; IS IT WISE TO BUY OR WAIT FOR RATES TO FALL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIAN HYMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Should I buy now or wait for interest rates to drop? 
</P>
<P>
 As interest rates rise, some home buyers are debating whether to buy now or 
wait for rates to come down. Others are racing to buy before rates climb 
further. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages have increased more than 1.5% during 
the past few months. As rates go up, so does the cost of a new house. Buyers 
who don't have the financial ability to pay for more expensive housing have 
several options. They can scale down their housing requirements and buy a less 
expensive house. They can switch from fixed to adjustable-rate financing, which 
makes qualifying easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Or they can drop out of the house hunt altogether and wait for housing to 
become more affordable again. Buying a less expensive house makes sense as long 
as you buy a house that will suit your needs for four to five years. Moving is 
costly. It wouldn't make sense to buy a house that you know you'll outgrow in a 
year or two, particularly if you're buying into a market where home values are 
stable or where they're declining. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if you buy into a booming market where home prices are rising 
rapidly, buying a short-term house can be an excellent investment. In this 
case, postponing a purchase could cost you more than it would to buy now and 
move again in several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Even buyers who can afford fixed-rate loans are switching to adjustable rate 
mortgages (ARMs) to save money. ARMs are still available with start rates in 
the 5% to 6% range. Buyers who are having difficulty qualifying at higher 
interest rates, should shop around for an ARM program that qualifies borrowers 
based on the starting interest rate. If the initial ARM rate is a discounted 
rate, lenders often require that you qualify at 2% above the start rate (that 
is, at 7% rather than 5%.) 
</P>
<P>
 When considering an ARM, always look at the worst case scenario. How long will 
the initial interest rate be in effect and what will the interest rate be after 
the first adjustment? How high can the interest rate go if interest rates 
continue to climb? How long will it take for the ARM rate to reach the maximum 
allowed under the loan program? 
</P>
<P>
 First-Time Tip: Buyers who intend to move again within the next five years 
will probably save money by taking an ARM because of the current cost of 
fixed-rate financing. But, make sure that you won't be charged a payment for 
early prepayment if you do plan to move again soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers who can't live with the uncertainty of mortgage payments that fluctuate 
should consider one of the hybrid loan products. These loans have interest 
rates that are fixed for 3, 5, 7 or 10 years. At the end of this time, the loan 
either converts to an ARM, or to another fixed rate, or it must be paid off in 
full. The initial fixed rate on these loans is lower than the rate on a 
fixed-rate loan that's due in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Another option for buyers who are nervous about the interest rate fluctuations 
is to select an ARM with a relatively stable index. Ask a mortgage broker to 
explain the different index options to you. 
</P>
<P>
 The Closing: It's risky to wait for housing to become more affordable again 
before you buy. Although no one knows for sure which way rates will go in the 
future, there's speculation that interest rate increases lie ahead. If home 
values rise while you wait for rates to come back down, you'll end up spending 
more for a house, not less.

GREEN THUMB; GLIDE INTO SOME RELAXATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLINGSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glide into some well-deserved rest and relaxation on your patio, porch or 
lawn. There is little that helps relieve tension and stress after a long day 
like the gentle back-and-forth motion of a patio glider.Glider swings have long 
been a part of the American "relaxation" scene, and one sitting can take a 
person back to the days of big front porches and band concerts in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Measuring 51 inches long and built to last, this version is made from Douglas 
fir and plywood. However, one can easily substitute redwood for the fir to give 
a more rustic look. A detailed step-by-step plan features more than a dozen 
photos, along with drawings, instructions and handy finishing tips. The gliding 
assembly is simple and will give years of trouble-free operation.

HOME WISE: GREEN THUMB; LARGEST WATER-USER IN HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: My wife and I are planning a remodel of our guest bathroom and want 
to install a water-saving toilet. We want to do our part to conserve water, but 
we were shocked when a neighbor told us about problems with these toilets. Can 
you give us some more information on problems with low-flush toilets? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Your neighbor may be suspicious of low-consumption toilets clogging 
your sewer or drain-field, but studies locally and in other cities concluded 
that clogging is not an issue. Like all products, some low-consumption toilets 
perform better than others. Check out the July, 1990, issue of Consumer Reports 
magazine for performance test results on a group of low-consumption toilets. 
</P>
<P>
 With toilets as the single largest water user in the home, this is a good 
place to start saving water. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical pre-1975 toilet uses between 5-7 gallons per flush (g.p.f.). New 
low-flush toilets use just 1.6 gallons. An average family of four can save 
about $100 a year in water and sewage charges, just by switching from a 
standard 5 g.p.f. toilet to a new 1.6 g.p.f. low-consumption toilet. Less water 
per flush also means less sewage to be treated. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously this is a savings in the amount of water you use when you flush. 
Aside from running out and replacing all your toilets, another way to save 
water is to flush the toilet less often. Unnecessary flushing to dispose of 
items such as facial tissues, spiders, food waste or other items should be 
discontinued and those items disposed of in a more appropriate manner. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're not going to replace the other toilets in your house, there are some 
things you can do to reduce the amount of water these toilets use. Perhaps the 
easiest is to displace some of the water in the tank. This can be done using a 
plastic laundry or dish soap container, or any plastic container with a tight 
fitting lid. Fill the container with water or sand and carefully place it in 
the toilet tank. Be careful not to let the bottle interfere with the flush 
mechanism. Do not use a brick. Bricks may deteriorate over time and result in 
expensive plumbing problems down the road. You should also check with your 
local water utility . . . many have free water saving devises to retrofit into 
toilet.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: PALM SPRINGS; SLIP SLIDIN' AWAY; SIZZLING FAMILY FUN, AND 
DRAMA, AT THE OLD WATER PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jessica's dad and I scrambled barefoot up the stairs, dribbling water and 
debating whether to launch ourselves down the Rattlers, or the Sidewinder, this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Mark's eyes widened and he pointed up, forcing me to confront the biggest 
drag an adult faces in taking children to water parks: Every now and then, 
you've got to act like an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 There, on a platform high above the desert floor, my waif of a daughter stood 
behind a dozen or so wiry, hormone-emboldened adolescents, casually awaiting 
her turn to plummet 70 feet in a virtual free fall on the most horrifying slide 
in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Ashley's ninth birthday, and my wife, Pam, and I had taken her and her 
friends, Annie and Jessica, along with our own younger children, Emily and 
Bobby, for a three-day and two-night vacation package offered by the Oasis 
Water Resort Villa Hotel in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oasis' advertised summer-package rates ($119 a night weeknights, 
three-night minimum, including 10 water-park passes) get more complicated and 
expensive when a weekend is involved, and the representatives I talked to on 
the phone, uniformly afflicted with that weary whine of young Southern 
Californians, were not eager to help. 
</P>
<P>
 But check-in at the enormous complex, about a mile from the water park, was 
painless, and within minutes we were hauling suitcases and presents into a 
clean and sprawling two-bedroom, three-bath condominium with a full kitchen, 
two TVs and fold-out sleeper and a view of two pools, a fountain and the San 
Jacinto Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 That evening, our friends Mark and his wife, Clare, who were staying at a 
friend's place nearby, dropped in and we grilled a feast of salmon, shark and 
Chilean sea bass on the condo's patio barbecue. Then, with the light on the 
tram visible high in the blackening San Jacintos, but the desert air still hot 
and clear, we trooped out to the nearest pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Palm Springs, with its eerie, daylight ghost-town demeanor and streets named 
after Dinah Shore, tends to give me the creeps. Now, though, as I ferried the 
kids on underwater dolphin rides, the pool's lights cast quavering shadows in 
the water, and I slipped back to my own childhood when summer nights in the 
Southern California desert were as dazzling as a mirage. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday morning, Pam and I let the kids bicycle, roller skate and 
roller-blade to the resort's free breakfast spread of cereals, muffins, juice 
and coffee, served poolside at the main clubhouse. As they rolled back, 
exploring the serpentine sidewalks that connect the pools, tennis courts 
(grass, clay and hard-surface) and 110 condos in the 27-acre complex, the lawn 
sprinklers hissed on, drenching and delighting them. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the water park doesn't open until 11, I decided to occupy the kids 
with a dare. "I wonder how long it would take you to swim in every pool in this 
joint?" I asked, tapping my watch. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls were off in a blur of flower-patterned spandex. Darting over the 
lawns and past puzzled sunbathers, they hurled themselves into each of the 
resort's eight pools, in what I suspect is a world record: 18 minutes and 47 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time they caught their breath, the park was about to open. 
</P>
<P>
 At 21 acres, the Oasis is small compared to other water parks. But that's an 
advantage when you're trying to keep an eye on seven kids (my sister, Laurie, 
had shown up with Peter, 11, and Stephanie, 6). 
</P>
<P>
 Our first step was to stake out turf in a far-too-rare swatch of shade. Then, 
with the kids sprinting ahead, we set out to face the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby, at 3, dug sliding down Mr. Frog's padded tongue in the "squirt city" 
area next to the chaotically choppy wave pool. The 6-year-olds immediately took 
to the gentle Tortoise and Hare kiddie slides. But other rides, which spit 
swimmers into pools at speeds that mock the wildest playground contraption, 
forced the gang to confront their bravado. 
</P>
<P>
 Adults, meanwhile, grappled not only with their physical daring, but with 
another question: Did they have the guts to risk looking dorky in public? 
</P>
<P>
 I had answered that question a few years back, when I discovered water parks. 
I found myself trotting anxiously from slide to slide, driven by a nagging 
fear: These things are so much fun, someone's certain to declare them illegal 
any minute now!  
</P>
<P>
 I still felt that as I lay on my back on the Rattlers, and hurtled down the 
cork-screwing, translucent tubes, sloshing ecstatically up the side, dropping 
abruptly, and banking again at speeds attendants say can reach 43 m.p.h. 
Kicking up fantails of water as I skittered to a stop, I was as exhilarated as 
if I'd surfed a big wave, as relaxed as if I'd had an hour massage. 
</P>
<P>
 Other pleasures are soothing, if less frenetic. At one point, for instance, I 
grabbed an inner tube and plopped into the "river" that meanders in a lazy 
circle through the park. One by one, the kids paddled up on their tubes and 
"docked," locking on with arms and legs, until we resembled one of those barge 
conglomerations that float down the Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 By afternoon, most of the children had gathered their nerve and were blasting 
down the Roadrunner or spinning along in the open flume of the Sidewinder. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Annie had remained timid. Finally, peer pressure persuaded this 
7-year-old cutie to give a moderately thrilling slide called the Centipede a 
try. 
</P>
<P>
 Annie stepped into the water and stared into the slurping tube that would 
carry her spinning into God-knows-what-sort-of aquatic nightmare. Behind her, a 
long line of impatient patrons watched as the attendant gently cajoled her 
forward. Slowly, Annie's face worked itself through a subtle array of 
expressions: anxiety about the ride, anxiety about her fears, fear about her 
friends' reaction to her anxiety and finally, simple terror at the whole 
dramatic spectacle, which manifested itself in heart-rending sobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaving through the line, I escorted her back down the stairs: "It's brave not 
to let people pressure you to do something you really don't want to," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, Mark pointed out Ashley, who was working her way up . . . 
the Scorpion! 
</P>
<P>
 When I tried the Scorpion earlier, it felt as if I'd stepped off a seven-story 
building: My internal organs log-jammed in my esophagus as I dropped straight 
down, then rattled chaotically while my rubbery carcass hydroplaned to a 
jarring stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Figuring Ashley might not be ready for that, I sprinted up the stairs and 
reached her just as she stepped onto the fiberglass chute. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley looked me in the eyes, then inched forward to stare far down at the 
sweeping panorama of desert. Waves of vertigo hit as I followed her gaze. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ashley," I said, knowing that I needed to finesse this, "I'd feel a lot 
better if you not do this today." 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly the raw fear on her face faded, and she replaced it with a familiar, 
eye-rolling scowl of tolerant annoyance -- a look that also contained, I 
discerned, a dash of something more tender. Our hug as I carried her off the 
slide was the highlight of my trip.

HIKING: NORTHERN CALIFORNIA; STANDISH UP FOR THE EEL RIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The redwood groves at Standish-Hickey State Recreation Area, about 60 miles 
north of Mendocino, are always pleasant to walk through, but visitors come to 
this park for the Eel River and its swimming holes, steelhead and salmon 
fishing, campgrounds and hiking trails at its banks. 
</P>
<P>
 The park's premier arboreal attraction, which is an hour's hike from the 
parking lot, is the Capt. Miles Standish Tree, a scarred redwood giant that is 
225 feet tall, 13 feet in diameter and estimated to be 1,200 years old. The 
tree honors the early pilgrim. Standish family descendants and a local family, 
the Hickeys, donated many of the 1,020 acres to form the park, which was 
established in 1922. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eel passes through some of Northern California's most inspiring scenery on 
a long journey from its headwaters in the Yolla Bolly Middle Eel Wilderness to 
its mouth at Eureka's Humboldt Bay. The river has sculpted impressive towering 
bluffs along the two-mile South Fork stretch within Standish-Hickey. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the rain-swollen Eel River floods so often, its banks, bottom and 
swimming holes change each year. All the park's footbridges are removed during 
the winter, effectively making most of the trail system inaccessible eight 
months out of the year. Even so, high water sometimes knocks out a bridge or 
two in late spring and early summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Standish-Hickey's three-mile round-trip Lookout Trail gives hikers a good look 
down at the Eel, but I prefer the more intimate view of the park offered by two 
loop trails -- Big Tree and Mill Creek. Both are open from May through August. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: From U.S. 101, a mile north of Leggett, take the 
Standish-Hickey State Recreation Area exit. Once inside the park, continue 
straight past the entrance station, taking the very steep road down to the 
seasonal bridge across the Eel River and over to Redwood Campground. Bear right 
after campsite No. 108 to the day-use parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: Join signed Big Tree Trail for a short distance to a fork and bear 
left. The path soon leaves the banks of the Eel and begins a mellow ascent 
through the redwoods. 
</P>
<P>
 A mile out, the trail passes a junction with the other leg of Big Tree Trail, 
crosses Page & Gates Logging Road and arrives at the Capt. Miles Standish Tree. 
From there you can choose whether to return via the other branch of Big Tree 
Trail and complete your hike, or join Mill Creek Loop Trail. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter path crosses meadowland and ascends through the woods to a slightly 
scary-looking landslide area above Mill Creek. The trail descends to cross the 
creek, then climbs again, traveling along a ridge, descending again toward the 
Eel River. 
</P>
<P>
 The path meets Page & Gates Road very close to the mouth of Mill Creek where 
it flows into the Eel River. Go right on the road for a short distance. Follow 
the trail signs that take you back into the creek bed for a short detour around 
the now-unsafe bridge over Mill Creek, then resume walking on Mill Creek Loop 
Trail, which ascends a bit at first before leveling out through lovely Big Tree 
Meadow. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at Miles Standish Tree, you'll join Big Tree Trail's left fork on the 
other side of Page & Gates Road, descending to the river and crossing Cabin 
Meadow. When you reach the banks of the Eel, near the park's swimming area, 
you'll cross a little log bridge; follow the trail over the opposite gravel bar 
to a second wooden bridge to Redwood Campground and the trail head. Big Tree, 
Mill Creek Trails 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE: Standish-Hickey State Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 DISTANCE: 2-mile loop via Big Tree Trail; 6-mile loop via Mill Creek Trail. 
</P>
<P>
 TERRAIN: Redwood-Douglas fir forest, towering bluffs of Eel River. 
</P>
<P>
 HIGHLIGHTS: Miles Standish Tree, grand river views. 
</P>
<P>
 DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY: Moderate. 
</P>
<P>
 PRECAUTION: Main park trails accessible only during summer when footbridges 
over Eel River are in place.

DESTINATION: HAWAII; THE PAGET FAMILY IS BACK, AND OFF TO THE ISLANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DALE PAGET and SUSAN PAGET 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The plan is simple enough. Take two weary parents in need of a second 
honeymoon, add three little kids, a wallet full of credit cards, a tent, 
swimsuits and a map, and set them loose for the summer on the Hawaiian Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a fantasy adventure for us -- a cross between "Gilligan's Island" and 
"The Swiss Family Robinson" -- only we'll have a plane flight to rescue us in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for this holiday came to us after a long day of working and parenting 
in our home/office in Cardiff-by-the-Sea, just north of San Diego. The kids 
were down at last and we collapsed on the sofa and flicked on the tube. We 
channel surfed to images of palm trees, white stretches of beach and turquoise 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 The coconut dropped. And we began plotting how we could go tropical for the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The scariest part is thinking about the financial damage that everyone says we 
are about to bring upon ourselves. Travel agents and friends warn us that our 
adventure in the 50th state will max out our credit cards. We're told that 
resorts rule the islands nowadays, and paying $300 a night or more is not 
unusual. A night ! We've got to make $300 last a week. 
</P>
<P>
 But, just in case, we'll be carrying every bit of plastic we own. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to funding more than 66 days away, we still have to hold down the 
fort at home. With rent, the usual bills, etc., we came close to reconsidering. 
But it's our dream to travel and write. 
</P>
<P>
 We hope to prove that our family of five can explore all of Hawaii without 
losing our muumuus. 
</P>
<P>
 Wondering how we are all going to pull the vacation off keeps us tossing and 
turning all night long. Butterflies are doing triple lutzes in our stomachs. 
It's been like this ever since we booked our plane flights to paradise. The 
excitement has rubbed off on the two oldest kids, who march around the 
apartment wearing fully loaded junior backpacks looking like Marines training 
for battle. "I'm bringing a calculator, binoculars, a red pen and rubber 
bands," reveals Henri. 
</P>
<P>
 Matilda isn't leaving without her purple headband and Barbie lipstick. "You 
need to look pwetty in Hawaii," she explains. Presley, the baby, has no idea 
what she is in for. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll get off the beaten track during our two weeks at each of the more 
popular islands of Oahu, Maui and Hawaii. Traveling by boat and plane, we've 
set aside three weeks to venture onto Kauai, Molokai and Lanai. 
</P>
<P>
 Our quest for paradise will take us on a treasure hunt for real, 
polyester-free luaus, live volcanoes and coconut pancakes. This is a BYO 
goggles and snorkel vacation. Heck, we may even sling back a Mai Tai with Don 
Ho. 
</P>
<P>
 Our living room has been turned into Hawaii Central, and everyone has joined 
in on the action. A big map of the islands from the Automobile Club is on the 
wall. A collection of guide books from the library is stacked on shelves and 
tables. The children have been flipping through coffee table picture books. We 
even rented the video of "Hawaii," based on James Michener's famous epic novel, 
and have found a reason to watch old episodes of "Magnum PI." 
</P>
<P>
 Henri, who will miss the last three weeks of second grade, has been given a 
special work contract by his teacher to write a journal, calculate our daily 
meal costs and keep a list of the new Hawaiian words he learns. 
</P>
<P>
 The first order of business has been getting the best airline fare. We 
compared prices by calling travel agents, airlines and charter companies. The 
cheapest, a charter air-fare package for $219 round trip from LAX, allowed only 
a stay of seven days; other major carriers allowed only a 30-day stay for their 
lowest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Plane fares fluctuated with the day, date, time and type of flights, Tuesdays 
and Thursdays appearing to be the least expensive departure days. Our final 
choice was Hawaiian Airlines. The round-trip fare of $377 for adults and $340 
for Henri and Matilda was about the average discounted ticket price. Presley 
sits on our lap for free. Grand total: $1,434. Cha-ching! 
</P>
<P>
 After landing on Oahu and spending three nights at a Waikiki hotel, we will be 
winging it, looking for the best deals on hotels, car rentals and 
island-hopping air and ferry transportation. We don't mind camping or catching 
a bus if it will help us keep the costs down. It's also a great way to meet the 
locals. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything we need for this extravaganza will have to be carried on our backs. 
We've invested in a couple of good quality packs and have a portable stroller 
for Presley. Where the diapers will go -- we haven't a clue. 
</P>
<P>
 With the tickets issued and bags stuffed to the brim, our island survival 
training camp on the mainland is almost over. 
</P>
<P>
 We know from the moment we step on the plane that things are not going to go 
exactly as planned. But for this family of Hawaii honeymooners, not knowing 
what will happen next is all part of the magic of this journey.

AT HOME; YOUNG, NEW FAMILIES AND PIONEER RESIDENTS MAKE FOR CHARMING MIX; 
WESTPORT HEIGHTS: OCEAN BREEZES, "INTERESTING TOPOGRAPHY" BECKONS FAMILIES WITH 
CHILDREN TO AREA WITH OLDER RESIDENTS. 
</P>

editor.

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Dave Cagle and his family moved into their home in the Westport Heights 
section of Westchester in December, 1991, there were only a handful of kids on 
their block. Now there are 13 young children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The child population has mushroomed in Westport Heights," said Cagle, the 
public affairs officer of the UCLA School of Dentistry, who has two children of 
his own. "There are young families moving in here every day." 
</P>
<P>
 A walk around Westport Heights confirms Cagle's observation. Young couples 
pushing strollers can be found on practically every street of this northeast 
Westchester neighborhood, bounded by Sepulveda Boulevard on the west, La Tijera 
Boulevard on the east, 74th Street on the north and 85th Street on the south. 
</P>
<P>
 Westport Heights realtors agree that young couples comprise the majority of 
new residents in the area. Lois Becker, a realtor with Kent/Prudential, said 
the newcomers cite as one of the area's attributes the cool ocean breezes that 
blow the smog to the east and lower the temperature on most afternoons. They 
also enjoy the "interesting topography" -- the curved streets and rolling 
hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Westport Heights' location, close to the San Diego Freeway, Los Angeles 
International Airport, Marina del Rey and Downtown, makes for relatively easy 
work commutes to most parts of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Westport Heights offers the best value for single-family homes on the 
Westside," said Roberta Trousdale of Re/Max Beach Cities Realty. Prices range 
from $200,000 to $225,000 for a two-bedroom, one-bath ranch-style house to 
between $250,000 and $275,000 for a three-bedroom home. A sprinkling of 
high-end homes list at $400,000 to $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the homes in Westport Heights were built by the Nowell Brothers 
construction company in the 1940s. Owners of such homes proudly point out the 
brothers' trademark features of coved or sculptured ceilings, arched doorways, 
hardwood floors and bay windows. Cagle, who paid close to $300,000 for his 
1,200-square-foot, two-bedroom, one-bath 1941 Nowell house, vouches for its 
quality construction: He put the home's roof, plumbing and wiring through a 
rigorous prepurchase inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 Many original buyers in the 1940s and 1950s still occupy their Westport 
Heights homes. The older residents staying put results in an unusual 
multi-generational mix in Westport Heights. The retirees, home during the day, 
mingle on the street with stay-at-home parents walking their infants. Both 
groups keep an eye on the neighborhood from 9 to 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Cagle says this easy coexistence between Westport Heights' new faces and its 
pioneers contributes to the area's charm. "When we were moving in, we could 
barely get the stuff out of the truck because people kept stopping by to shake 
our hands," he said. Neighbors trade tools, share fruit from their back-yard 
trees and baby-sit for each other's children. 
</P>
<P>
 Such friendly relations result in a safer neighborhood, Cagle added. "Where we 
used to live in Brentwood, we had seven instances of crime against us 
personally in two years," he said. "Here we've had nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Mel Plew, the Los Angele Police Department's senior lead officer in Westport 
Heights, agrees that the area has a good safety record. "I've seen an 8% 
decrease in crime in Westport Heights in the last year (from 1992 to 1993)," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He credits much of the decrease to residents' active participation in the 
Neighborhood Watch program. The LAPD's new training academy, slated to open 
later this year on the corner of Manchester Avenue and Osage Avenue, just south 
of Westport Heights, will beef up police presence in the neighborhood, Plew 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 All the emphasis on safety and neighborhood cooperation appealed to Pam Wiltz 
when she bought a home down the street from the Cagles in September, 1993. 
Wiltz, a 37-year-old manufacturer/designer of children's bedding and 
accessories, paid $257,000 for the 1,600-square-foot, three-bedroom home she 
shares with her 5-year-old son, Trevor. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was single and footloose, living in Brentwood was fine," Wiltz 
explained. "But once I became a mother, I felt disconnected there. The hustle 
and bustle was not geared to a mom and a child." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Lefferman, who lives on Vicksburg Avenue around the corner from 
Wiltz, says she and her neighbors have found a rewarding way to bring their 
street together. Four or five couples and their children gather every two weeks 
at each other's homes for a casual back-yard barbecue. During the day, these 
same families walk together to the nearby YMCA for exercise classes and 
children's activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The moms hang out together so much, these kids have been raised practically 
as siblings," Lefferman said.  
</P>
<P>
 Lefferman, a program-development consultant, has lived in Westport Heights 
with her psychologist husband since 1989, when they paid $330,000 for a 
1,400-square-foot, two-bedroom, one-bath home. Lefferman says she's been 
pleased with the community as a whole, but admits she's undecided about 
eventually sending her 3-year-old son to Westport Heights Elementary School. 9 
</P>
<P>
 Like many Westport Heights parents, she's heard mixed reviews about the 
performance of this Los Angeles Unified School District campus. Some parents 
like the multi-ethnic mix, while others say the diversity creates language 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 George Claseman, a 72-year-old retired truck driver who 30 years ago paid 
$29,000 for his Westport Heights home, says the demographics of the entire 
neighborhood have changed, not just those at the grade school. 
</P>

 "It was much quieter around here in the early days," he said. "The homeowners 
were mostly couples in their 50s and 60s." He's also noticed a deterioration of 
the shopping district along Sepulveda Boulevard. "I used to feel safe going 
there after dark -- now I wouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents echo Claseman's complaint about the quality of the area's 
commercial establishments. "I miss the variety of choices I had in Brentwood 
for shoe repairs or gift shops," Wiltz said. "Now I either have to use the 
local shop or drive further." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners who previously lived in Santa Monica or other trendy Westside 
locales have to trek back to their old neighborhoods to buy such specialty 
items as rosemary bread or black-bean pasta. "With all these young families 
moving in, the stores around here should start stocking more yuppie items," 
Cagle said. He would also like to see more restaurants and coffeehouses within 
strolling distance of his house.  
</P>
<P>
 But for other residents, the modest commercial zone contributes to Westport 
Heights' small-town atmosphere. "I like the fact that the shopping district 
hasn't been gentrified," said Rob Thais, 45, who's lived in Westport Heights 
for seven years. "It would be cool and hip if the stores went upscale, but it's 
nice that they've been untouched by time. It makes Westport Heights different 
from other parts of the Westside. It gives the area a tranquil, relaxed 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Thais, an English teacher at Santa Monica High School, grew up outside of 
Baltimore and wanted to buy a home in an area that reminded him of his suburban 
childhood. He and his wife Linda, also a teacher, selected a 1,500-square-foot, 
three-bedroom, 1 3/4-bath home on Airlane Avenue, for which they paid $235,000. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Thais says that geographic buffers on three sides of Westport Heights -- the 
ocean to the west, the airport to the south, Ballona Wetlands to the north -- 
reduce heavy congestion in the area and contribute to the quiet environment he 
sought. 
</P>
<P>
 "This area is 15 minutes away from anything fun we want to do," Thais said. 
"It's close to where we want to go, but not right in the middle of it. It's 
boring for adults and great for kids -- that's why we love it." Westport
