 But would Elvis take them to court?: KBIG-FM, you may have heard, was sued by 
representatives of Barry Manilow for bragging that it didn't play his 
recordings. The suit has since been settled but KBIG could have avoided legal 
problems in the first place if the station had instead unearthed an old KQLZ-FM 
theme:

 Caltrans -- speeding things up!Yes it's true, at least in the case of a Ft. 
Lauderdale, Fla., trucking firm struggling to deliver 54,000 pounds of relief 
supplies to quake victims through a sea of red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Amerijet International had donated a truck for the nonprofit group, Neighbors 
Helping Neighbors, to deliver the cargo. First, the truck was halted by a state 
weight station in Pensacola because it exceeded the legal highway weight limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida relented after Amerijet manager James Bassett persuaded Alabama, 
Mississippi and Louisiana to allow the truck to cross its borders. "I was 
talking to state officials for three days," Bassett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Texas resisted. "We had to sneak through Texas," Bassett said. 
</P>
<P>
 California also refused to waive the weight limitation. But Caltrans persuaded 
a local company to take part of the load when the truck reached Blythe. The 
cargo arrived in L.A. over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just heard from Texas today (Monday)," Bassett said, laughing. "They said 
OK."

 Banking's a beach: We recall more affluent times when male bank tellers wore a 
dress shirt and tie to work every day. Alas, like everyone else, bankers seem 
to be suffering the effects of the recession. The other day, in a Bank of 
America branch in Long Beach, we spotted a teller decked out in a green T-shirt 
(and no tie).

 Our greatest fan letter: We thought the note from Atco, N.J., was the first 
request of us for an autographed photo -- until we noticed that it was

 In 1785, four years after settling L.A., the inhabitants grew worried about 
being isolated from Mexico. So, in order to ensure their safety, they decided 
to really arm themselves. They sent for 35 pounds of gunpowder and 800 bullets.

AL MARTINEZ: A TALE OF TWO RUBINS: THE ORCHID POTTER AND THE 'WOW' PEDDLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let's clear this up instantly. There are two Jerry Rubins. One is a Venice 
peace activist who makes $6 an hour potting orchids. The other is a Famous 
Ex-Radical who paid $85,000 in personal income taxes last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Venice Rubin is relatively soft-spoken and says please and thank you and 
had to resort to potting orchids because peace is ruining his paid anti-war 
activism. 
</P>
<P>
 The Other Rubin jumps in your face waving health powders like "Wow!" and 
displays the kind of relentless energy that drove the Establishment crazy 25 
years ago, first when he was a screaming yippie and then a member of the 
Chicago 7. 
</P>
<P>
 When the two Rubins are together, there is no confusing them. The Venice Rubin 
is tall and curly-haired, wears shorts, a tank top and sneakers and doesn't 
speak unless spoken to. 
</P>
<P>
 The Other Rubin is shorter and neatly trimmed and wears a gray pin-striped 
suit and red patterned tie and darts around his $5,000-a-month high-rise 
apartment like a chipmunk in a forest, demanding redress. 
</P>
<P>
 The redress he is demanding is clarification. He wants the world to know he is 
not the orchid-potting Jerry Rubin but the Rubin who, like Ollie North, leaped 
from the ashes of a former career to achieve success in a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 The new endeavor is network marketing in association with a company called 
Life Extension International, which is about as far removed from political 
activism as Howard Stern from the Bishop of Canterbury. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin and LEI hustle health potions like the aforementioned "Wow!," an 
orange-flavored confection which the Famous Ex-Radical urged me to drink, 
promising it would make me feel stronger and smarter within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he turned to the Venice Jerry Rubin, fixed him with a stare hard enough 
to pierce armor and said, "I can make you rich." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This all began with a nice little column I wrote a fortnight ago about the 
Venice Jerry Rubin, whom I shall call Rubin 1. He is director of the L.A. 
Alliance for Survival and made his living taking half of the alliance's profits 
from its anti-war activities. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the Berlin Wall came down, Russia fell apart and the peace movement 
began going to hell, all of which impacted on the $6,000 a year Rubin was 
making to live on. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony of a peace activist suffering from the agony of peace appealed to 
me, so I wrote about Rubin, a 50-year-old guy who, by his own assessment, had 
no skills, couldn't drive and had only $2 in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Two things happened. Rubin got a job potting orchids for $6 an hour and 
probably would have been happy potting orchids the rest of his life. But then 
along comes the Famous Ex-Radical, the 1960s yippie turned yuppie, a 
description, as columnist Dan Akst says, that runs through his life like a 
Homeric epithet. 
</P>
<P>
 This Rubin, Rubin 2, who is either 47 or 53, depending on whom you believe, 
moved to L.A. recently from New York and was busily making his bid as Health 
Powder King of America when suddenly he begins getting telephone calls from 
people asking if he wants to borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
 They have read my column on the Venice Jerry Rubin and assume, upon an 
inability to perceive details, that it is he. 
</P>
<P>
 He pays little attention at first, but then women begin calling to say they 
are not going out with a guy who has only $2 in the bank. Where could he 
possibly take them? Then his landlord, whose confidence in Rubin's ability to 
pay is badly shaken, begins demanding several months' rent in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 At least this is what I hear in a series of telephone calls from Rubin, his 
women, his lawyer, his ex-wife and I don't know who else. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin himself calls maybe half a dozen times, begging, cajoling, pleading and 
demanding. The confusion of Two Rubins is ruining his life, he says. He even 
gets Rubin 1 to take time away from potting orchids to call and say maybe we 
ought to clear the whole thing up. 
</P>
<P>
 The assault is endless. I am beginning to feel like Lyndon Johnson during the 
Vietnam War. Hey, hey, LBJ, how many babies have you killed today?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both Rubins love publicity. They sense media potential the way a tiger shark 
detects a bleeding seal. By smell? Vibrations? Color alterations in the 
atmosphere? Who knows. Science is working on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin 2 was the one orchestrating a thrust for clarification, since he has the 
most to gain. Whenever his name appears in print, another 500 cases of "Wow!" 
are sold throughout the known world. 
</P>
<P>
 But the prospect of more ink also appeals to Rubin 1, so he takes a bus to 2's 
high-rise in Westwood. The security guard says who would you like to see and he 
says, "Jerry Rubin." 
</P>
<P>
 The guard says, "Name please?" and he says "Jerry Rubin" again. 
</P>
<P>
 The guard says, " Your name," and he sighs and says, "We're the same." 
</P>
<P>
 I am told this story by Rubin 1 in Rubin 2's 11th-floor luxury apartment where 
we have gathered for the Clarification Session. "See!" says Rubin 2 
triumphantly. "There's confusion everywhere!" 
</P>
<P>
 In order to end the confusion, 2 launches into a narrative of his own success, 
in contrast to 1's pathetic orchid-potting existence. He shows me copies of his 
personal and corporate income tax forms to prove his worth and says he has made 
more money in one year than Rubin 1 will make his entire life. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a strange monologue coming from a guy who once placed money in the same 
category as the John Birch Society, but he delivers it with a verve not to be 
denied. Suddenly, by his narrative, "Wow!" is transformed into something on a 
level with mother's milk and holy water. 
</P>
<P>
 1, meanwhile, seems content to leave the show to his more famous counterpart, 
mumbling occasionally that he still loves peace and doesn't mind potting 
orchids, but that's not good enough for 2, whose kinetic personality is not 
unlike that of a mongoose in a tank of cobras. He is everywhere at once. Even 
when he is sitting he is standing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is at this point that 2 offers to make 1 rich. "I want you to work for me," 
he says. "I want every Jerry Rubin in America to work for me." 
</P>
<P>
 He offers to train 1 to sell his health potions, even as he has trained 
thousands of others. Rubin calls his networking "people's capitalism," a phrase 
that manages an egalitarian cant even as it holds out the prospect of ease and 
opulence through entrepreneurial magic. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin 1 mumbles something in response, to which 2 says, "What? Speak up, 
what'd you say?" in words that whistle by 1's ear like .50-caliber bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to think it over," 1 says uneasily in a tone only slightly louder 
than before. Clearly, he would like to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin 2 is not happy with the offer left dangling but lets it go at that. I 
suspect 1 will go right on potting orchids for $6 an hour and 2 will go right 
on hustling "Wow!" until he is Wow King of the World. He is already planning a 
news conference based on our Clarification Session, and who knows what else. 
Oprah? Donahue? Geraldo? 
</P>
<P>
 For my part, I am no happier or smarter for having drunk "Wow!" and hope never 
to hear from another Jerry Rubin for the rest of my life. It would almost be 
worth another world war just to keep them all busy working for peace. How could 
it hurt?

WASHINGTON FIRST, NOW SACRAMENTO; BUT CAN STATE POLITICIANS MOVE AS QUICKLY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was impressive. The Clinton Administration and Congress moved with speed 
and efficiency in response to the nation's costliest natural disaster. Less 
than four weeks after the Northridge earthquake devastated vast parts of Los 
Angeles, Congress authorized $8.6 billion in aid. It was indeed, as President 
Clinton said Saturday when he signed the bill, "the most comprehensive national 
response ever to a region experiencing a natural disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so you cynics out there say what this shows mainly is that Clinton already 
has his eye on reelection and on California's 54 electoral votes. Fair enough, 
but the bottom line is that California's delegation, with Clinton's support, 
has shepherded the most federal aid ever for a single U.S. disaster. And that's 
something. 
</P>
<P>
 THE FEDERAL CHECK: It's too bad that the federal aid -- $8.6 billion plus $900 
million already spent -- doesn't cover the whole bill. Losses stemming from the 
6.8 earthquake on Jan. 17 have been estimated by Gov. Pete Wilson's office at 
between $13 billion and $20 billion. Wilson has put the state's share of the 
repair costs at $1.9 billion and local governments' at $135 million. Private 
insurers are expected to cover $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 A good chunk of the federal aid -- $4.6 billion -- will go to the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency, which under the very able guidance of James Lee 
Witt has been the central coordinating agency for federal relief. The $8.6 
billion will be used for housing aid and the reconstruction of highways, 
schools and other public facilities as well as for loans to offset damage 
suffered by renters, homeowners and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress also included a controversial denial of long-term assistance to 
illegal immigrants -- aid extending more than 90 days. That was a politically 
necessary compromise. However, it is not too much to ask that the "reasonable 
steps" required by the bill to determine the legal residency of long-term 
beneficiaries be fully monitored. There must be no discrimination based on race 
or ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
 THE STATE'S TURN: Now Sacramento must turn its attention, quickly, to raising 
more funds for relief, repairs and rebuilding. The most fiscally responsible 
approach is pay-as-you-go, adding, on a temporary basis, a few cents to the 
price of a gallon of gasoline and a quarter-cent to the sales tax. Revenues 
from the temporary gas tax hike would be for vitally needed seismic safety 
retrofitting of bridges and overpasses. The sales tax increase would go for 
other earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge to state legislators is to act as swiftly as Congress and the 
Administration, which have set an example of decisive response to a natural 
disaster. The spotlight's on Sacramento now.

CHILD CARE ISN'T CHILD'S PLAY; PARENTS RELY ON GOVERNMENT INSPECTION TO THEIR 
FOLLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In some child care centers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Nevada and 
Wisconsin, raw sewage recently was found in play areas, fire exits were locked 
or blocked, broken glass and roaches were evident and children had access to 
toxic chemicals including bug spray and antifreeze. In Los Angeles, the 
Northridge earthquake uncovered problems of a less disturbingly obvious but 
still serious sort. More than 200,000 children are cared for daily in licensed 
facilities subject to no requirements for safety glass, bolted bookcases, 
emergency food and water supplies or even flashlights. 
</P>
<P>
 With a majority of parents of young children in the work force now, the demand 
for high-quality institutional child care continues to grow, far outpacing the 
supply. With that growth has come problems that public agencies alone, with 
chronically strained budgets, simply cannot solve. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, according to the federal General Accounting Office, states, which are 
almost exclusively responsible for regulating the quality of child care, have 
cut their budgets and enforcement personnel in agencies that license and 
inspect day care centers. Federal auditors, making unannounced inspections at 
sites in the four states mentioned above, found widespread hazards. Because 
states receive federal child care grants, some in Congress are calling for a 
stronger federal presence -- and federal regulations -- in the operation of 
child care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal standards make some sense, as do state regulations that would require 
preschool and day care facilities to meet the same earthquake safety standards 
that govern elementary schools. However, even with tougher government standards 
and a cadre of vigilant inspectors to monitor compliance, consumers -- parents 
-- have to be responsible too. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors can't be there every day, but parents usually are. Look carefully, 
ask questions and listen to what teachers and your child tell you. Learn what 
the law requires in terms of health and safety and make sure for yourself that 
the facility is clean and safe.

NO STABILITY WITHOUT THE ZULUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In yet another challenge to democracy in South Africa, the Zulu-based Inkatha 
Freedom Party plans to boycott the nation's first free multiracial elections. 
This protest isn't expected to derail the election of Nelson Mandela as the 
country's next president; he clearly is the favorite of most black South 
Africans, including some Zulus, and he can also count on limited white support 
in the April balloting. But Mandela and President Frederik W. de Klerk must 
figure out some way to resolve the concerns of Zulus or, as Monday's 
demonstrations indicated, face more threats to the hope for peaceful democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of Zulus protested outside a meeting between De Klerk and Zulu King 
Goodwill Zwelithini. Shots were fired and at least one person was killed. The 
killing provides another reminder of the rivalries in the new South Africa. 
What's needed now is hands-on negotiation, perhaps led by a more aggressive 
Organization of African Unity. 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk's session with the Zulu king did not go well. The king insisted that 
Zulus would reject the new constitution and defy the new government. They want 
nothing less than their own independent state. This political impasse is yet 
another consequence of apartheid. That philosophy, advocated for decades by De 
Klerk's National Party, resulted in the creation of so-called "independent" 
black homelands. Zulus rejected total independence but accepted self-government 
and all the perks, patronage and public dollars that rewarded that obeisance. 
</P>
<P>
 Their elected leader -- another Zulu chief, Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi -- 
stands to lose power when Mandela takes over. In April, Buthelezi will also 
have to give up his dream of becoming the first black president of South 
Africa. That dream had been nurtured for years by white leaders who appreciated 
Buthe- lezi's anti-communist stance and his opposition to economic sanctions 
and the political struggle advocated by Mandela's African National Congress. 
Buthelezi was quickly eclipsed by Mandela after the latter's release from 
prison four years ago, but the Zulu leader refused to acquiesce without a 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zulu nation's current course is a not very well disguised demand for 
respect. Parties that have influence with Inkatha must understand this but in 
the end prevail on all Zulus to participate in the new democracy.

POLITICIAN WATCH; PENSIONS PLUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors will have the chance today to 
modify -- although not, unfortunately, eliminate -- one of the more flagrant 
taxpayer rip-offs in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago then-Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon initiated, 
and the supervisors oh-so-quietly approved, a plan to permit the cost of 
benefits to be treated as compensation when calculating county pensions.Thus 
benefits such as medical and dental insurance and -- for supervisors and others 
lucky enough to have them -- car allowances now count as salary when 
determining pensions. That sweetener will boost taxpayer costs by as much as 
$400 million over the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gloria Molina, who was not a member of the board when the 
pension-spiking scheme was adopted, says that it's costing about $300,000 a 
week to fund this particular goody. She's supporting recommendations made by 
the Economy and Efficiency Commission to control the plan's abuses. Among other 
things, benefit costs would be excluded when figuring pensions for future 
employees and the dollar amount allowed for current employees would be cut or 
frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 All this is of course worth doing. Regrettably it won't roll back the 
windfalls that pension spiking already has made possible. One non-elected 
official will retire next month, for example, with an annual pension about 
$35,000 higher than his current salary. This program is a scandal. It will be a 
far greater one if the supervisors don't act today to curb it. Taxpaying voters 
are waiting and watching.

CLINTON HEALTH CARE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Thank you for your editorial on the Clinton health reform plan (Feb. 3) 
which is generally right on the mark. Doctors, individually, and collectively 
through the American Medical Assn., agree with The Times that this enormously 
complex piece of legislation (unfortunately and inexplicably developed in 
secrecy) while admirable in stated goals, does require major modifications if 
these goals are to be achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill as it stands, Clinton's rhetoric notwithstanding, would require 
extensive cost controls imposed by government. As Alain Enthoven and virtually 
all economists have pointed out, cost controls in any sector of economics 
simply don't work. 
</P>
<P>
 Further technological advancement would be subject to a government review 
board and not to market forces. Advances in medical care could be impeded.  
</P>
<P>
 This bill threatens the malpractice reforms enacted in this state and could 
drive up medical costs. Since we have costs contained in this state by managed 
care, the result could be ruinous with severely impeded access. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally you laud Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi's plan and with this we 
respectfully disagree. You have previously credited Garamendi with being a 
prime mover behind the Clinton plan. Garamendi favors a single-payer system. A 
single-payer system, if government, is socialism and, if private, is monopoly. 
History teaches us that no matter how good they sound, neither works. Nor for 
that matter will the Clinton approach.

 * Re your editorial: CalPERS does not control costs. It shifts them. At our 
local hospitals, CalPERS Blue Shield pays a per diem rate of between $830 and 
$950. A three-day hysterectomy stay would be approximately $2,500-$2,900. An 
indemnity-insured or cash-paying patient would pay between $7,000 and $9,000 
for the exact same services. 
</P>
<P>
 Given such disparity in prices, not only does CalPERS not pay its own way, it 
does not contribute to the financing of welfare or charity cases. 
</P>
<P>
 It is agreements such as CalPERS that drive indemnity plans out of the 
marketplace, and shift the costs to those who often can least afford it -- the 
cash-paying patient.

 * Your editorial discussed Clinton's health plan. In this as well as all other 
media presentations, a concern is always raised about another governmental 
bureaucracy to be created. No one in the media mentions the massive bureaucracy 
that is encountered in dealing with insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies, as are all big businesses, are interested in one primary 
individual -- the stockholder. Clinton's plan is also interested in one 
individual, but that one is the person who needs health care now and can't get 
it.

<P>
 * Let me talk about real gouging that takes place in the medical insurance 
field by large insurance companies.  
</P>
<P>
 I was paying $307 per month for medical insurance as an individual. I was 
advised that due to inflation, rising health costs, and that many insurance 
companies no longer will cover this type of insurance, my policy unchanged in 
any way will now cost $466 per month. I believe if my math is correct, that is 
a 52% increase per month. I know from The Times, many hospitals and doctors are 
struggling to survive financially, but I have not heard of any insurance 
companies going out of business.

<P>
 * The Times correctly notes that Clinton's health plan will shut down private 
medical practice (Commentary, Feb. 2). The Clintons would outlaw the purchase 
of medical care directly from a doctor. The Clinton plan would close doctor's 
offices by the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 This deprives Americans of their freedom to choose their own private doctor. 
When the few remaining doctors are herded into corporate or government-run 
HMOs, their new allegiance is to their paymaster, not their patient.  
</P>
<P>
 To preserve private practice, and the quality it embodies, the citizen's 
constitutional right to buy care must remain the bedrock of any plan. This 
Congress should develop job-portable, tax-free medical savings accounts. These 
permit the consumer to buy care directly without the intervention of government 
bureaucrats, or insurance company rationing.

GERRY ADAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * At last, an article by an American columnist who really understands the 
situation in Northern Ireland, the nature of the IRA, and the true character of 
its spokesman, Gerry Adams! I couldn't agree more with every statement made by 
Edwin M. Yoder Jr. (Commentary, Feb. 6). 
</P>
<P>
 What is so disturbing beyond the fact that Adams "gulled" talk show hosts who 
do not understand the situation in Northern Ireland, is the hero's welcome 
accorded Adams upon his arrival in the U.S. Now it is clear just where the IRA 
gets its seemingly endless funds with which to purchase its weapons of death 
and destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 IRA interference in the affairs of Northern Ireland so enrages the Protestant 
majority that it actually hampers the peace process.  
</P>
<P>
 JOAN MORRISON 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * The anti-Irish column by Yoder attacks Adams of Sinn Fein (the political arm 
of the IRA), President Clinton for allowing him 48 hours to present his case in 
discussion of the Northern Ireland situation, and the "talk show airheads" who 
let him speak his mind. When it comes to Ireland, there is plenty of blame by 
all sides to pass around -- not just to the IRA. There is little to be gained 
from suppressing different points of view. 
</P>
<P>
 The British press could have written the column. Gerry Adams may not have been 
ready to present breakthrough proposals for peace but he did stir up others, 
such as the British government, to improve their offers, which might lead to 
possible developments.  
</P>
<P>
 The problems in Northern Ireland involve primarily economic oppression cloaked 
in bigotry and religious persecution. Yoder clearly has no knowledge of this 
situation but he is the one that is paid to mouth off.

'SUGAR HIGH' STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Feb. 3 article "No Evidence of 'Sugar High' In Children Found" was at 
best misleading. Misleading because the experiment was done comparing sugar 
with aspartame (or Nutrasweet) and saccharin, two additives that have been 
implicated in children's hyperactivity.Had the sugar been compared with a diet 
free of artificial additives, a much different picture would have been painted 
-- with vast improvement in the behavior of children on the additive-free diet. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of children used in this study was pitifully low (25 children ages 
3-5, and 23 children ages 6-10) to make such a statement of finality. 
</P>
<P>
 One can't help but wonder who funded the grants for this study. Was it the 
drug manufacturers or aspartame and saccharin? Was it the sugar industry?

EYEWITNESS: HELEN BERNSTEIN; CARING PEOPLE, SINKING MORALE; TEACHERS: THEY WERE 
'THERE' FOR OUR KIDS AFTER THE QUAKE; WHEN WILL SALARIES, SCHOOL FUNDING, 
REFLECT THEIR VALUE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By As told to Robert Scheer, Times Contributing Editor; Helen Bernstein, 
president since 1990 of United Teachers-Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Unified 
School District union, is a history teacher on leave. She grew up in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I thought it was remarkable the way teachers responded to the earthquake. They 
have really risen to the occasion. Teachers are holding classes in their homes. 
Teachers are calling parents to see how the kids are, giving them assignments 
over the phone. People have really gone above and beyond what was necessary.  
</P>
<P>
 This has been very heartwarming, considering the fact that most of the people 
we're talking about are incredibly demoralized. They just took a 10% pay cut, 
and they don't really feel a commitment toward this district, don't have very 
much faith in its leadership and where it's going. They're confused. They just 
came out of this big battle of having to defend public schools (over the 
voucher proposal), and they see themselves entering into another battle over 
the next budget and feel very underappreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 I was eating lunch in the cafeteria at a school in the San Fernando Valley 
last week during an aftershock. Instead of dropping under the tables, the 
teachers just ran out to the kids, and I said, "Where are you guys going?" They 
said, "We've got to be with the kids!" And they get out there and their kids 
are all eating lunch and aren't the least bit frightened. Actually, the 
teachers were much more shaken up about the earthquake than the children were. 
</P>
<P>
 So I want to reassure people who are afraid to let their kids go back to 
school, to let them know that the people they are leaving their children with 
are really caring people and their kids will be safe.  
</P>
<P>
 I think schools are always safer than the streets, but in this case I'm 
talking about emotional stability for kids, about people who are really loving 
and caring and understanding. And I'm not sure that the average parent who 
never talks to their child's teacher, who really doesn't have much connection, 
understands this -- because we have so much transiency in Los Angeles, and so 
many kids who are bused. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a matter of just having kids come back to school and drawing a 
picture saying what's wrong -- in fact it gets kids more frightened to do that. 
What you have to do with kids, and what I've seen teachers doing as I'm going 
around from school to school, is say to them: "What would make you feel better, 
what do you need to feel less afraid?" It's helping the kids put together a 
picture in their heads that they actually have some control over this -- not a 
lot; you can't stop the earth from shaking -- but there are things you can do. 
They talk about safety and about where you should be and how you should take 
care of yourself and what you should have packed up at home, and they've been 
really responsible about all this.  
</P>
<P>
 I think it's funny -- it's not as if teachers all went to a workshop on 
Tuesday after the earthquake and were told: "When you get back to class here's 
what you need to do." They all instinctively -- at least the vast majority of 
them -- knew what they needed to do, and there was no curriculum guide. And 
maybe that's the way we have to have schools, where you allow the classroom 
teacher to just do their own thing, instead of (being directed by) this 
terrible bureaucracy.  
</P>
<P>
 What inspired me the most is that teachers were doing this despite their own 
problems -- 20% of our teachers in the Harbor area live in the Valley -- that's 
a huge percentage traveling across town -- and we have thousands of teachers 
who live in the Santa Clarita area. On the Monday that school opened after the 
earthquake, we had the highest attendance among teachers of any Monday in the 
school year! At my school, Marshall, we had 100% teacher attendance -- I can't 
remember when we ever had 100% teacher attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a compelling feeling that we had to come back and be there for the 
kids and get things back in order. When they were under a great deal of stress, 
when it would have been easy to say, "Listen, I've got to take care of myself," 
they were at school helping kids. 
</P>
<P>
 I think that people who can react this way, and who are trusted with the 
safety and well-being of the young people of this city, ought to be treated 
with more respect and certainly be reimbursed in a way that they can stay in 
the profession and not be driven out. 
</P>
<P>
 I was at a Federal Emergency Management Agency meeting and they said that a 
family of four is considered in the poverty range at a starting teacher's 
salary -- $25,000. There's something all screwy about that. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a master's degree and I've been with the system for 25 years and I make 
a big 47-something. I get a teacher's salary as union president. That's the top 
teacher's salary. I don't consider that, for a lifetime of work and a master's 
degree, all that fabulous.  
</P>
<P>
 If I lived in Des Moines, that would be one thing, but it's not very much in 
Los Angeles. I, for instance, could not afford to buy my own house back. I 
wouldn't even qualify for a loan. But the principal at my school makes $90,000. 
The custodian at my school makes as much as a teacher. Bus drivers make $52,000 
with overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Our children spend a third of their day in school under the influence of a 
teacher. Why someone with that much influence is relegated to the bottom of the 
ladder is beyond me -- but that's the case.  
</P>
<P>
 It was just a mere year ago that all the counselors that everybody wants in 
the schools now (after the earthquake) -- the counselors, psychiatric social 
workers, psychologists -- were being laid off. The irony is that now 
everybody's so concerned about the conditions of the schools and getting the 
kids back into school. We're talking about 650,000 kids influenced by these 
very same people that everybody a year ago was saying, "Aw, what the hell, cut 
their pay 10%." 
</P>
<P>
 People are really concerned about the school buildings and how they held up in 
the earthquake, yet they haven't passed a bond issue for the schools in 20 
years. Do people think the schools can somehow be retrofitted for free?  
</P>
<P>
 The educational tax rate in this state is 47th out of the 50 states. New York, 
New Jersey, Pennsylvania pay twice as much per student as we do. And they're 
getting it from somewhere. There are districts in New York state that spend 
$12,000 on a student -- we spend $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 We opened the school year in September and there were 1,000 vacant teaching 
positions. It's going to be worse next year. Every district in the L.A. Basin 
pays higher salaries than the L.A. Unified School District. I think we're 41st 
out of 43 districts in terms of teacher salaries. Three years ago we were 
first. Our principals, our school secretaries and other staff positions rank 
first, second or third in their categories in terms of salary of the 43 county 
districts. Los Angeles has one of the highest-paid superintendents. Teachers 
are at the bottom. And the working conditions are worse here -- class sizes are 
bigger, for example. The last class I taught had 39 kids. 
</P>
<P>
 In a crisis like this, schools are the one place that bring a community 
together. Where is it they put all these Red Cross centers and tent cities? 
They're in the schools, in the gymnasiums. They're the center of the community. 
The public school building means a lot emotionally to people in the United 
States, and it's getting lost. Yet when we have a crisis, it's the first place 
people turn to.

COLUMN RIGHT/ STEVEN S. LUCAS: GENDER EQUITY HAS THE LAPD OVER A BARREL; 
DOUBLING THE PROPORTION OF WOMEN APPLICANTS WOULD REQUIRE A LOWERING OF 
STANDARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN S. LUCAS, Steven S. Lucas, a lawyer in Los Angeles, served as counsel 
to the Webster Commission, which evaluated the LAPD's preparation for and 
response to the 1992 riots. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council will soon be tackling the politically charged 
issue of determining whether the face of the "new" LAPD should mirror that of 
the public generally. The proposal on the table -- the brainchild of a feminist 
legal-rights organization and introduced by Council members Jackie Goldberg and 
Zev Yaroslavsky -- would require that all incoming LAPD classes be at least 
43.4% female, the precise proportion of women in the work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in a politically correct world could such a proposal, which was made 
without any supporting data or study, rise to the level of political 
salability. Under closer scrutiny, however, it is clear that the so-called 
gender-equity plan would not only be disastrous for the morale and 
effectiveness of the department; it also would present a very real danger for 
the safety of the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the plan acknowledge that the 43% quota cannot be reached under 
the LAPD's current hiring practices; there are simply insufficient numbers of 
qualified women candidates able to pass the department's physical abilities 
test. Even now, only 55% of female applicants -- as compared with 93% of male 
applicants -- are able to pass the test. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents nonetheless suggest that the quota can be reached because certain 
elements of the physical testing, such as scaling "the wall" and several other 
tests of upper body strength, do not relate to job performance and should be 
abandoned. This is simply feminist fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers, whether male or female, must have the strength and the 
endurance to use force effectively when it becomes necessary to do so, 
including the upper body strength to apprehend suspects and to climb obstacles 
during a foot chase. The safety of the public in some instances depends on 
these abilities. The criteria for upper-body strength must therefore be 
maintained, unimpeded by the political agenda of those who have the ear of 
certain members of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of the Goldberg-Yaroslavsky motion attempt to draw attention away 
from the physical requirements of the job by focusing on the "feminist approach 
to policing," the perception that women officers possess a unique ability to 
defuse tense situations. Yaroslavsky supports this argument by pointing to the 
Christopher Commission's finding that female officers are involved in incidents 
of excessive use of force at rates substantially below those of male officers. 
This finding, however, is by itself an insufficient basis from which to draw 
any conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christopher Commission, restricted in its inquiry by the narrow directive 
of the Police Commission, never studied the many other factors relevant to 
gender-based assessments of performance, such as the relative rates of force 
used against, and the relative effectiveness of the use of force by, female and 
male officers. 
</P>
<P>
 More fundamentally, the gender equity plan ignores the substantial progress 
the department has already made in adding women to the force. Over the past 12 
years, the department's hiring goal, which was raised to 30% in 1992, has 
resulted in a fivefold increase in the proportion of women in the corps of 
sworn officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal to again raise the hiring goal is founded on the unexplained 
principle that somehow it is satisfactory for certain professions to be skewed 
in relation to women in the work force, but others, such as policing, must 
display perfect symmetry to that same benchmark. No reasoned argument has ever 
been advanced for why this must be the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In their urgency to reach this result, and in disregard for their 
responsibilities to the city, Goldberg and Yaroslavsky also ignore the legal 
exposure that the gender equity plan would create. In recent years, only 22% of 
LAPD applicants have been women (a figure that is substantially higher than the 
13%-17% average of other California law enforcement agencies). The plan 
requires that women be hired at a rate that is double their proportion in the 
LAPD's applicant pool. Doing so would cost the city enormous sums to defend 
reverse-discrimination claims brought by male applicants passed over in favor 
of lower-testing female applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiring more female officers is an admirable and worthwhile goal. However, the 
Los Angeles Women Police Assn., an organization committed to this end but 
nonetheless opposed to the gender-equity plan, recognizes the appropriate 
ordering of priorities: The proper issue for the Police Department and the City 
Council is not how many women should be hired, but rather how more women can be 
hired without sacrificing the effectiveness of the force.

COLUMN LEFT/ ALEXANDER COCKBURN: CLINTON DOES A QUAYLE WITH FACTS OF LIFE; HIS 
SHAMELESS LECTURING ON 'FAMILY VALUES' ONLY REINFORCES THE MYTH OF TEEN WELFARE 
MOMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER COCKBURN, Alexander Cockburn writes for the Nation and other

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the start of February, President Bill traveled to the poor neighborhood of 
Anacostia in Washington, D.C., where the kids, ready with questions about NAFTA 
and the Clean Water Act, were treated to his headline-seeking homilies about 
"personal responsibility" and sex. 
</P>
<P>
 The searing cynicism of this documented philanderer grandstanding about sexual 
mores to impoverished eighth-graders in a crumbling inner-city classroom almost 
beggars description. 
</P>
<P>
 But using the most defenseless members of our society as stage props for a 
"family values" campaign snitched from Dan and Marilyn Quayle doesn't bother 
our brave commander in chief. The 1980s Reagan-Bush paranoia against 
adolescents has evolved into 1990s Clinton hostility. When all else fails, even 
the most hack politicians can get a headline by picking on teen-agers as the 
source of all social ills, from dissolute welfare-leeching to murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The present public delirium about a (black) teen-age sex epidemic, born of 
irresponsibility and lack of family and religious values, is a cruel fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The supposed epidemic of "children having children" simply doesn't exist. In 
only a negligible number of births -- about 20,000 annually -- are both 
partners under the age of 18. Sociologist Mike Males of Occidental College, who 
has done fine research on this issue, points out to me that this represents 
only 4% of births among teen-age girls and less than 1% of the total births 
each year in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton remains fired with the urge to lecture people about their moral 
values, he should preach to men 20 and older. These are the fellows who mostly 
leave teen-age girls pregnant and with sexually transmitted diseases, including 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't expect consistency from the President. A week after his repulsive 
performance in Anacostia he visited a GM plant in Shreveport, La., where he 
raised some good-ol'-boy laughs with a rib-nudging reminiscence about the 
Astroturf in the back of his El Camino pickup in the 1970s, and "You don't want 
to know why." 
</P>
<P>
 No lectures about values to this crew, who were more likely than 
eighth-graders to ask Clinton what qualified him to be a preacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth: An increasingly nonegalitarian society pushes poor teen-agers further 
and further to the margin and then blames them for lack of "responsibility." 
Poverty, not age, is the problem among all ages and racial groups. Higher rates 
of poverty provoke higher birth rates. 
</P>
<P>
 As Males points out, the term "teen-age pregnancy," in most cases where it is 
labeled a social problem or assigned "public costs," is simply a euphemism for 
the much larger category of "low-income pregnancy." 
</P>
<P>
 And contrary to elite lore, a wide majority of teen-age parents appears to 
adapt well to parenthood: Most unmarried teen mothers are married within five 
years, most have jobs and few receive welfare. Teen-age child-bearing creates 
more public costs than adult child-bearing because teen-agers are poorer. A 
mythic teen-age rutting boom fueled by a supposed absence of "family values" 
has produced an imaginary baby boom in which "irresponsible" teen mothers 
inseminated by feckless black youths are lodged on lifetime welfare instead of 
having Norplant under their skin as they train for those mythical good jobs at 
good wages. 
</P>
<P>
 This can scarcely be a secret to Clinton's advisers on these issues, such as 
Marian Wright Edelman of the Children's Defense Fund, Hillary Rodham Clinton 
and Donna Shalala. Scholarly work by Edelman's group exposes the myth, even as 
Edelman chimes in with the opportunistic Clinton line, thus betraying the poor 
kids her organization professes to speak for. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least two-thirds of pregnant teenagers," Males tells me, "have childhood 
histories of violence and sexual abuse in their homes. This makes Clinton's 
threat in the State of the Union to cut off teen-age mothers from welfare and 
force them to live with a parent or grandparent doubly cruel." 
</P>
<P>
 When writer Jonathan Kozol visited a public school in Anacostia, he asked the 
principal what he found most frustrating about working with young people. "On 
Fridays in the cafeteria," the man answered, "I see small children putting 
chicken nuggets in their pockets. They're afraid of being hungry on the 
weekends." And this President, fresh from cutting public spending, lectures 
them about responsibility. It should be the other way around.

By ANITA M. MANGELS is executive director of the Laguna Fire Relief Coalition, 
a nonprofit organization founded after the firestorm last October. She told The 
Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the aftermath of a disaster, relief agencies can't make everyone "whole." 
That's where the local citizenry can step in, not just to help with immediate 
needs, but with the gaps that surface later. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Fire Relief Coalition, for example, offered short-term financial 
assistance to survivors in need. Now, many of them are finding that insurance, 
loans and government programs won't cover their costs of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Together with the Community Clinic, we continue to administer FEMA-subsidized 
mental health programs, such as crisis counseling. We are replacing 
fire-destroyed tools, enabling some folks to resume the business of making a 
living, and we are still distributing food, clothing and other supplies.  
</P>
<P>
 But it takes a lot more than just handing out canned goods and cash to heal a 
community. So our extensive network of volunteers maintains close contact with 
people who were once their neighbors, but who suddenly found themselves with no 
neighborhoods. This personal link to the community, while intangible, is 
perhaps the most important recovery effort of all. Because it's not buildings 
that define a neighborhood, it's people.

OVERTIME ISN'T FUN TIME FOR THE KINGS AGAIN, 3-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Kings must dread the NHL's five minute overtime period this season. 
</P>
<P>
 They lost to the Calgary Flames, 5-4, with 38 seconds remaining in overtime on 
Feb. 5 at the Forum and they lost to the New York Rangers, 5-4, with 1 1/2 
seconds remaining in overtime on Jan. 27 at home. 
</P>
<P>
 After scoring two third-period goals to overcome a 2-0 deficit and force the 
Boston Bruins into overtime Monday night at the Forum, the Kings lost, 3-2, 
when right wing Glen Murray scored his eighth goal of the season on a 15-footer 
with 56 seconds remaining in the extra period before a sellout crowd of 16,005. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenseman Alex Zhitnik gave away the puck at the right boards to center Ted 
Donato, who fed right wing Steve Heinze in the circle. Heinze set up Murray, 
who was uncovered in the slot and he put it past the legs of goalie Kelly 
Hrudey. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenseman Rob Blake, who sent the game into overtime when he scored his 16th 
goal of the season with 5:39 remaining in the third period, took the blame for 
the loss because he was too late in getting to Murray. 
</P>
<P>
 "You feel the weight of 24 guys when you make a mistake like that," Blake 
said. "It was just coverage and we go over that day in and day out in practice 
and when you let it go . . . It's just a mental mistake, not being in the right 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should have been closer to him. I should have been on him very much 
sooner." 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a year after making the Stanley Cup finals for the first time in 
franchise history, the Kings are in jeopardy of failing to make the playoffs 
for the first time since 1986. If the season ended today, the Kings (21-29-6) 
wouldn't be in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's do or die, and if we don't get it going we're going to be out of it," 
King center Pat Conacher said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third period, the Kings did get going, scoring twice in a 2:34 span to 
tie it at 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Gretzky, the NHL leader with 98 points before the game, assisted on both 
goals to record the 14th 100-point season of his 15-year NHL career. He leads 
the NHL with 72 assists and 50 points on the power play. 
</P>
<P>
 Jari Kurri scored his fourth goal in the last three games with 8:13 remaining 
on a pass from defenseman Doug Honda. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings got a chance to tie the score only four seconds later when they went 
on a power play after left wing Dave Reid was penalized for hooking. Blake tied 
it when Gretzky set him up from behind the net. Blake beat Bruin goalie Vincent 
Riendeau for his fifth power-play goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings, who were outshot 141-69 in their last three games, were outshot 
18-2 by the Bruins in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to motivate his team, King Coach Barry Melrose inserted center 
Brian McReynolds and left wings Dave Tomlinson and Keith Redmond in the lineup. 
All three had been recalled earlier in the day from the minor league affiliate 
in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been playing well and I had to get some guys who play hard in 
there," Melrose said. Melrose benched right wing Tomas Sandstrom, who hasn't 
scored a goal in his last six games. It was the second time this season that he 
has been scratched. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm (mad) about not playing, but he's the coach and he makes the calls," 
Sandstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
 King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Tavares, the Mighty Duck club president whose comments about Wayne 
Gretzky influencing officials inspired Gretzky to a five-point performance in 
the Kings' 5-3 victory over the Ducks on Friday, said he has learned a lesson. 
"The bottom line is what I was trying to accomplish was to push Wayne away from 
the referee and vice versa," Tavares said. "Instead, what happened is I pushed 
him toward the net." Tavares stands by his claim that Gretzky influences 
officials. "Anyone who has achieved what he has is going to have influence with 
officials," Tavares said, although he said he realized Gretzky was upset that 
he said he "cries all the time" to officials. "We all learn lessons in life, 
and I prefer to learn mine from the best," Tavares said. "He's a good teacher, 
and I'm a fast learner." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Granato, suspended for high-sticking Chicago Blackhawk defenseman Neil 
Wilkinson, will appear at an hearing today in New York.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Those interested in entry-level jobs in baseball should apply for 
commissioner. . . . The owners got their wish when they emasculated the 
position. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Robin Yount, who played 20 years with the Milwaukee Brewers, belongs in the 
Hall of Fame someday alongside Carl Yastrzemski, who played 23 years with the 
Boston Red Sox and was inducted in 1989, and George Brett, who played 21 years 
with the Kansas City Royals. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Yount and Yaz each had a career batting average of .285. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Where the ex-Dodgers are now: Dave Anderson will manage the Detroit Tigers' 
farm team at Jamestown, N.Y., of the New York-Penn League, and R.J. Reynolds 
will try to make the Cincinnati Reds' roster after spending two years in Japan. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Tom Lasorda on National League realignment: "We're very happy to get the 
Atlanta Braves out of our division." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Left-handed pitching being so important at Yankee Stadium, the New York 
Yankees made a good deal when they sent the overrated Bobby Munoz and two minor 
leaguers to Philadelphia for Terry Mulholland. The Yankees now have three 
southpaw starters -- Jim Abbott, Jimmy Key and Mulholland. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 New Orleans would be the best place for Jim Everett to attempt to resurrect 
his career. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams believe they can get a second-round draft choice in exchange for 
Everett. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, they also thought they would make the playoffs last season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A one-game suspension was the least Temple Coach John Chaney should have 
gotten after barging into Massachusetts Coach John Calipari's news conference, 
accusing him of intimidating officials, shouting obscenities and having to be 
restrained after charging the podium. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yes, Chaney also threatened to kill Calipari. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I don't care about the pressures of the job.There was no excuse, either, for 
the shouting match between Arizona's Lute Olson and California's Todd Bozeman 
on the sidelines. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky never will make the fashion Final Four with its new uniforms. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Look-alikes: Jason Kidd and Andrew Young. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shaquille O'Neal's limitations were exposed at the All-Star game. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Orlando Magic should hire Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to give O'Neal a crash 
course on the sky hook. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Then he might average 40 points a game instead of a mere 28.5. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Gentleman Prefers Blond: Dennis Rodman of the San Antonio Spurs is 17-1 as a 
blond. . . . Wayne Gretzky, who soon will break Gordie Howe's record with goal 
No. 802, scored NHL goal No. 1 on Oct. 14, 1979, against Vancouver goaltender 
Glen Hanlon. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The New York Rangers are interested in trading for Canuck property Petr 
Nedved, who is playing for Canada in the Olympics. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 There is something weird about a hockey game, the Quebec Nordiques vs. the 
Rangers at Madison Square Garden Friday, being postponed because of snow. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 Biggest star at the Sunkist track meet Saturday at the Sports Arena might be 
one of the smallest performers --  
</P>
<P>
 5-foot-3, 114-pound Gail Devers, who will compete in the 50-meter hurdles. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Craig Stadler's galleries at the L.A. Open were packed with admiring, 
heavyweight spectators.. . . 
</P>
<P>
 One of the problems facing CBS is that there aren't enough appealing events in 
the Winter Olympics to fill two weeks of coverage. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 My favorite venue is the Viking Ship. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The fourth annual welcome-home celebration for Mark Carrier, the Chicago 
Bears' All-Pro safety, Saturday at the Long Beach Hilton will benefit 
earthquake relief. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I'm picking Region to win the Santa Anita Handicap on March 5. He ran well in 
the San Antonio despite a troubled trip that resulted in his being placed ahead 
of disqualified second-place finisher Hill Pass. And basically, it was a prep 
race for trainer Richard Mandella's 5-year-old gelding. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Steve McCain, the NCAA high-bar champion last year as a freshman, and Kareema 
Marrow, who scored a perfect 10 on the vault recently, will lead the UCLA men's 
and women's teams in the UCLA/Gilda Marx Invitational Saturday night at Pauley 
Pavilion. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Todd Steussie, the offensive tackle from California and Agoura High, made a 
big impression at the NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Pro football mecca Las Vegas has two teams -- the Posse of the Canadian 
Football League and the Sting of Arena Football. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Last add Bud Wilkinson from Oklahoma graduate Stan Rosenfield: "I was in the 
student section in 1957 when Notre Dame ended our 47-game winning streak. There 
was stunned silence. Finally, someone yelled: 'Fire the coach!' "

IT'S ANOTHER TRIUMPH FOR THE HOME TEAM; CROSS-COUNTRY SKIING: ALSGAARD UPSTAGES 
MORE FAMOUS TEAMMATES WITH VICTORY AS NORWEGIANS FINISH 1-2 IN 30K RACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE KUPPER, TIMES ASSISTANT SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Monday was Norge Day at the Birkebeineren ski stadium, just as many had hoped 
it would be, in the 30-kilometer men's freestyle cross-country ski race. 
</P>
<P>
 It also was well below zero. But the sun was out. So naturally, the place went 
nuts. Bands played. Flags waved. People cheered. One side of the jammed stadium 
sang, "Heia, Norge! Heia, Norge! Ole! Ole! Ole!" Then the other side sang it. 
And that was before anyone had started skiing. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, a couple of hours later, when Bjorn Daehlie, one of the stars in the 
Norwegian constellation, strained across the finish line, bumping Finland's 
Mika Myllylae out of the lead before collapsing face-first in the snow, the 
place went nuts again. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Thomas Alsgaard, another Viking, steamed across moments later, to 
chants of "Oy! Oy! Oy!" surprisingly knocking Daehlie out of the lead, well, it 
was Mt. St. Helens East. 
</P>
<P>
 That gave Norway the gold and the silver -- Myllylae took the bronze -- and 
the only thing better would have been a sweep. Small matter to the hardy 
Norwegians, who weren't about to let either a missing bronze medal or a little 
chill spoil their day. 
</P>
<P>
 The stand-up stadium was filled with 31,000, and officials estimated that at 
least that many more, watching free, lined the course. There were tents and 
camp stoves out there, indicating that some of them had spent the night, and 
skier after skier remarked about how the exuberant fans had urged him on. 
</P>
<P>
 Alsgaard, 22, a power skier who had never won an international race, made the 
most of the moment, moving into the lead after the first seven meters, holding 
it the rest of the way and finishing in 1 hour 12 minutes 26.4 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 He was at a loss to explain his victory, though. "I don't know," he said, when 
asked how he had won. "To be sure, I don't know. I never expected it. I had a 
little hope for maybe a bronze but I never thought of gold."  
</P>
<P>
 He finally realized that he might win, he said, with about seven kilometers 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowd began to sing and I started to think of the gold medal," he said. 
"Then I tried to ski faster." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about beating his more celebrated teammate, Daehlie, winner of three 
golds and a silver two years ago at Albertville, France, Alsgaard said: "I'm 
afraid of what he's going to do to me tonight. Maybe beat me up." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Daehlie, 26, paid tribute to his young teammate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought my race was a super race," he said. "On the uphills, I was skiing 
as fast as I've ever gone, and he still beat me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the race, I didn't think of Thomas as the favorite. I thought more of 
(Vladimir) Smirnov (of Kazakhstan, winner of five of six World Cup races this 
season). I know Thomas is quite good, but I was a bit surprised he was so fast 
in the middle of the race." 
</P>
<P>
 Smirnov finished 10th, and Vegard Ulvang, another of the Norwegian stars, 
skipped this race because he does not ski the skating freestyle technique as 
well as he does the classical style, where each ski is in a track. 
</P>
<P>
 Alsgaard said he hadn't felt the cold during the race. "But afterward, my 
chest hurt," he said. "I don't think racing in such cold conditions is good for 
the body." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there was talk beforehand of postponing it until a balmier day. By 
then, though, fans had begun to arrive at the stadium and the course walkers 
were already lining the track. Norwegians tend to be somewhat reserved 
everywhere but at ski races, and depriving them of this day in the sun might 
not have been a wise decision. "There is nothing to prepare you for crowds like 
this," American skier Carl Swenson said. "I was really tired out there, but 
they made me feel better. I was psyched by the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, U.S. skiers did not fare particularly well by international 
standards. Luke Bodensteiner of West Bend, Wis., was the first American, 
finishing 36th in 1:20:13.0. 
</P>
<P>
 John Aalberg of Salt Lake City, a native Norwegian who became an American 
citizen before the Albertville Games, was 44th. Swenson, of North Conway, N.H., 
was 46th, and Marcus Nash of Fryeburg, Me., was 66th among 72 finishers.

 If two entrepreneurs have their way, the king of beers may soon be making way 
for the president of beers. 
</P>
<P>
 Billary Beer, named for Bill and Hillary Clinton, is elbowing in here on a 
crowded market dominated by self-proclaimed "king of beers" Budweiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Presidential Bottlers' co-founders say their beer is made from "Bill barley 
and Hillary hops mixed with slightly tainted Whitewater water . . . "  
</P>
<P>
 President Carter's brother Billy also had the distinction of having a beer 
named after him -- "Billy Beer."

 You gotta have a cookie. 
</P>
<P>
 Now! 
</P>
<P>
 One with chips big enough to satisfy this urge for chocolate that is making 
you crazy. Should you or shouldn't you? 
</P>
<P>
 When a craving is this intense, enjoy, say some researchers. Indulging 
occasionally might satisfy you enough to stay on the nutritional 
straight-and-narrow the rest of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoa, say others who counter that a little willpower is what's needed: Eating 
a nutritious, low-fat diet can reduce and even eliminate cravings. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the all-in-your-head approach: Rescript your mental image of 
craved foods to make them seem less appetizing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Chemical Connection: When certain brain chemicals increase, so do 
cravings, according to Sarah Leibowitz, a neurobiologist at Rockefeller 
University in New York, who has studied the effects of some brain chemicals on 
animals' appetites. High levels of a chemical called neuropeptide Y increase 
urges for carbohydrates, she says, while high levels of galanin make the 
animals choose fat-filled foods. 
</P>
<P>
 A taste for carbohydrates is highest in the morning, she says, while urges for 
fatty foods increase throughout the day, often peaking around dinner time. She 
says that is probably true for animals as well as people -- although abundant 
human data is lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 Another researcher, Adam Drewnowski, professor and director of the Human 
Nutrition Program at the University of Michigan, agrees that a variety of brain 
chemicals can trigger cravings. But for humans, he says, there are other 
factors that also influence what foods you crave. 
</P>
<P>
 Physiological factors such as pain, along with psychological factors such as 
depression, can bring on cravings, he says. Cultural and socioeconomic factors 
can come into play too. Consider the change in dietary habits in Japan, which 
has undergone drastic Westernization. "Fat intake there has tripled in the last 
25 years," he says. "But I am assuming their galanin levels have not tripled."  
</P>
<P>
 Food cravings often occur in response to a painful or stressful situation, 
Drewnowski says. "Sugar and fat may act as natural analgesics." 
</P>
<P>
 Some cravings are strongly tied to habit: You always eat popcorn dripping in 
butter at the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Gender Differences: Women tend to crave more often than men, Drewnowski 
has also found, although he does not know why. Women are likely to crave foods 
filled with fat and sugar, such as candy and cookies. Men are apt to want foods 
high in protein, fat and salt -- like a juicy steak. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wishing Away Those Cravings: Never mind those brain chemicals or life's 
stresses. The trick to controlling your cravings, says Linda Tatum, a Beverly 
Hills hypnotherapist, is to teach yourself to regard foods you crave as neutral 
or, better yet, unappetizing. 
</P>
<P>
 She asks clients with cravings to visualize the object of their desire -- say, 
a chocolate chip cookie -- on a large screen. Then she interrogates them about 
their mental image. Is the cookie in color? In a frame or free-floating? How 
does it smell? Is it on a plate? In clear focus? 
</P>
<P>
 Once that mental picture is firmly implanted, she asks the same questions 
about a food the client loathes -- say, cottage cheese. "In every case, 
something is different," she says. A cookie is likely to be pictured in 
mouth-watering color; cottage cheese in unappetizing black-and-white. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, clients learn to transpose mental pictures of the unappetizing food to 
the irresistible food: to see the cookie in black and white, for starters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Nutritious Approach: Eating right can reduce or eliminate cravings, others 
say. "If you are providing your body with optimal nutrients, you should not be 
experiencing cravings," says Diane Grabowski, a dietitian and nutrition 
educator at the Pritikin Longevity Center, Santa Monica, where the menu 
emphasizes very low-fat diets. 
</P>
<P>
 Concentrate on eating a diet with about 75% carbohydrates, 15% protein and 10% 
fats, Grabowski says, and your body won't want sugary, fried or fatty foods. 
She emphasizes eating carbohydrates that are unrefined -- apples instead of 
apple juice, for instance. Those who switch to a low-fat, balanced diet and eat 
frequently -- six mini-meals a day -- can expect cravings to disappear within a 
week, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Long View: Drewnowski acknowledges that some people -- but very few -- 
seem to adapt to low-fat diets without cheating, but if you're not one of them, 
an occasional indulgence might actually keep you healthier in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women who go on severe diets (with little fat or sugar) appear to be at 
greater risk of alcohol and drug use," he says, citing preliminary results of a 
current study. 
</P>
<P>
 Someday, drug treatments might target overwhelming cravings by normalizing 
levels of brain chemicals associated with them. Meanwhile, depriving yourself 
too much might have adverse long-term consequences, Drewnowski says.

BOOK REVIEW / SCIENCE; IN SEARCH OF THE 'LITTLE MAN' IN THE BRAIN; THE 
ASTONISHING HYPOTHESIS: THE SCIENTIFIC SEARCH FOR THE SOUL, BY FRANCIS CRICK , 
SCRIBNER'S; $25, 317 PAGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEX RAKSIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Francis Crick wants to know where "you" live. He isn't interested in the name 
of your street, nor in the color of your skin, nor even in the nature of your 
genes, which he, along with James Watson, helped discover in the 1950s.  
</P>
<P>
 His "Astonishing Hypothesis" is that "you -- your joys and your sorrows, your 
memories and your ambitions, your sense of personal identity and free will -- 
are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and 
their associated molecules." 
</P>
<P>
 And he wants to know the precise location in your pudding-textured brain of 
the cells that assemble "you." 
</P>
<P>
 Truth be told, while most of us are not likely to warm to the hypothesis that 
we are little more than pudding, few scientists today would call it 
astonishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Descartes' dualist theory of a separate mind and body began unraveling in the 
Renaissance, when physicians realized that such earthly afflictions as strokes 
could radically alter the spirit. It has all but collapsed in recent years, as 
scanning technologies with such spunky acronyms as PET and SQUIDs have 
localized the brain metabolisms that lead to feelings like sorrow and joy. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, it's one thing to localize and another to understand, and the 
hard truth is that even persevering and punctilious researchers like Crick have 
so far been unable to find a central core of being.  
</P>
<P>
 Neuroscientific thinkers seemed able to contain their frustration until 1991, 
when an audacious philosopher named Daniel Dennett published a book called 
"Consciousness Explained" (Little, Brown), in which he argued that there was no 
such core, no "homunculus" or "little man in the brain" who dutifully assembles 
our sense of self.  
</P>
<P>
 The book managed to directly insult Crick, who goes on in these pages to 
attack Dennett and other leading consciousness theorists, from Roger Penrose 
("The Emperor's New Mind," Penguin, 1989) to Gerald Edelman. In turn, Edelman, 
in his 1992 book "Bright Air, Brilliant Fire" (Basic) has criticized Crick, 
scoffed at Dennett ("His is not a theory of consciousness") and dismissed 
Penrose: "He's in over his head."  
</P>
<P>
 The battles seem less evocative of the elegant Salk Institute in La Jolla, 
where Crick works by the sea in an office designed by Louis I. Kahn, than of a 
place several miles south: the Primate Wing of the San Diego Zoo. And no 
wonder, for it can be argued that since cerebralism makes humans Top Primates, 
the person who comes to understand that cerebralism gets to be the Top Primate. 
</P>
<P>
 As in most battles, though, the warriors turn out to hold views that are more 
similar than they care to admit. 
</P>
<P>
 Crick begins this book by staking out a position antithetical to Dennett's: 
"There must be structures or operations in the brain that in some mysterious 
way behave as if they correspond somewhat to the mental picture of the 
homunculus." 
</P>
<P>
 But he ends by endorsing a notion similar to Dennett's "Multiple Drafts Model 
of Consciousness," wherein there is no single homunculus. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, probably out of annoyance at the legions of glib popularizers who 
analogize the brain to a computer, Crick snaps that "a brain does not look even 
a little bit like a general-purpose computer." But he ends up contending that 
computer-simulated "neural networks," while "far removed from the complexities 
of the brain," may indeed provide the key to understanding the brain's 
behavior.  
</P>
<P>
 (As Isaac Asimov pointed out in a 1967 article, computers are "far removed" 
from the brain largely because they are less complex: A modern, 
neural-networked computer may have fewer than 20,000 on-off connections, for 
instance, whereas the brain has about 100 billion cells with 100,000 billion 
highly complex connections.) 
</P>
<P>
 So if the ideological differences between Crick, Dennett and others are not 
dramatic, then why are their battles so heated? Because there is little 
agreement on where neuroscience should go from here.  
</P>
<P>
 At one end of the spectrum stand wildly speculative theorists such as Penrose, 
who says the answers may lie in physics. Crick's criticism of Penrose is 
unsparing but accurate: "At bottom, his argument is that quantum gravity is 
mysterious and consciousness is mysterious and wouldn't it be wonderful if one 
explained the other."  
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the spectrum are researcher's researchers, such as Crick. 
Crick's description in these pages of a more scientific approach to studying 
consciousness -- one that attempts to connect today's billowing, abstract 
theorizing to hard chemical evidence -- may prove daunting to some lay readers. 
But Crick himself is never intimidating.  
</P>
<P>
 On the contrary. Arguing that science cannot progress without laypeople like 
you and me asking basic, even stupid questions, he begins one chapter with this 
quote from economist Vilfredo Pareto: 
</P>
<P>
 "Give me a fruitful error any time, full of seeds, bursting with its own 
corrections. You can keep your sterile truths for yourself."

ART REVIEW; THE PAIN AND PASSION OF PICASSO'S 'WOMEN'; 'WEEPING WOMEN' AT LACMA 
REVEALS HOW THE INTERSECTION OF POLITICAL EVENTS AND THE ARTIST'S TANGLED 
ROMANTIC LIFE CONSPIRED TO GIVE US THESE REMARKABLE PICTORIAL ESSAYS ON HUMAN 
SORROW.

<P>
 Is it possible for an exhibition to fully coax forth the sources of a 
painter's compelling imagery? Can the mysterious soup of thought, feeling and 
accident that meld in making a work of art really be laid out? Can a show truly 
burrow inside an artist's head? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer of course is no. Some things are finally impenetrable. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, a marvelously engaging exhibition that opened Sunday at the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art comes as close as is likely possible to accomplishing that 
formidable feat. Beginning with a single painting and building outward to 
encompass both the personal and political history of the artist's life at the 
moment the picture was made, "Picasso and the Weeping Women: The Years of 
Marie-Therese Walter and Dora Maar" makes a convincing and unusual contribution 
to Picasso studies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The painting in question is the Spanish artist's "Weeping Woman With a 
Handkerchief," which he executed on June 26, 1937. It was a gift to LACMA just 
18 years later, from Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Mitchell. (He was the erudite 
character actor who famously played Scarlett O'Hara's father in "Gone With the 
Wind," won an Academy Award for "Stagecoach" and collected books and art -- 
Rembrandt, Whistler and Van Gogh among them.) Not the least of the show's 
achievements is the way it brings the small Picasso to vivid life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Weeping Woman With a Handkerchief" has always seemed to be a little gem, but 
the exhibition frames it in such a way as to reveal it as far superior than 
otherwise recognized. By the time the show is over, you look at the painting in 
a new way -- which is to say that now you really look at it. 
</P>
<P>
 The canvas is not large -- 21 5/8 by 18 1/8 inches -- but it packs a 
considerable punch. It shows the bust of a Spanish woman (she wears a mantilla) 
sobbing into a handkerchief. In just six colors, plus black and white, Picasso 
created an indelible image of mortal grief. 
</P>
<P>
 The bean-shaped head, balancing precariously on the point of a triangular 
neck, is surrounded by heavy blackness. The resulting sense of compression is 
enhanced by the flattened forms of the mantilla, whose open weave of lace is 
paradoxically represented by thick, crisscrossing lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's skin is bright white. Her nose and cheek are flushed with hot 
magenta, her acidic green lips shaded with pale, icy blue. The vivid yellow 
blouse framing her knotted fingers shrieks against the blackness of the 
background, while her red-orange hair hums against the complementary greens of 
the mantilla framing her head. 
</P>
<P>
 The sobbing eyes and the handkerchief are marvelous inventions. Thick, black 
lines stream weightily from the eyes, which are themselves shaped like 
teardrops. The handkerchief adjacent is a crumpled cloud, which Picasso has 
muddled with an agitated storm of scribbled pencil lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1955 gift of the picture was important for LACMA, because the Picasso was 
a special prize. It was painted within a week or two of the completion of his 
famous monumental picture of the brutal fascist bombing of the Spanish town of 
Guernica, a picture to which the small canvas bears an obvious relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 As the exhibition further demonstrates, for the first time, it also represents 
the resolution of an important theme that had absorbed Picasso in the months 
leading up to "Guernica" and that preoccupied him for several months after. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Almost never did Picasso paint faces that portrayed intensely descriptive 
emotion. The series of weeping women, which appear in about 60 drawings, prints 
and paintings throughout 1937, are an anomaly. Where did they come from? 
</P>
<P>
 The show's organizer, Judi Freeman, convincingly shows how the intersection of 
political events, represented by the Spanish civil war, and of personal 
relationships, in the artist's notoriously tangled romantic life, conspired to 
give us these remarkable pictorial essays on human sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 And with a gentle swipe at the admittedly insightful "boy's club" of scholars 
who dominate Picasso studies, the show's fine catalogue suggests that their 
admiring identification with the artist has kept them from seeing the unusual 
significance of the pictures of weeping women. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is divided into galleries with portraits of each of the principal 
women then in Picasso's romantic life. (There were also a few passing affairs.) 
He was estranged from his wife, Russian ballet dancer Olga Koklova. He was 
growing tired of his mistress, Marie-Therese Walter. And he was embarking on a 
new liaison with Surrealist photographer Dora Maar, who helped him to create 
"Guernica." 
</P>
<P>
 The political trauma of the Spanish civil war, in which the devastation of the 
Basque town was not unlike that in Sarajevo today, is necessarily represented 
by reproductions because "Guernica" cannot travel. A photograph (to scale) of 
Picasso's monumental painting, and of a dozen studies for figures in the mural, 
is accompanied by an eight-minute, unfinished documentary film, commissioned in 
1949 from the legendary director of "Nanook of the North," Robert Flaherty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The photo-mural and the film flank a gallery with four drawings, seven prints 
and six paintings of weeping women. Although no weeping women are in the final 
version of "Guernica," the relationship between the mural and the smaller 
pictures is plain to see. 
</P>
<P>
 So is their connection to the forms employed in his portraits: the sharp, 
angular, skull-like heads of the bitterly estranged Koklova; the sumptuously 
erotic, organic images of Walter; the keen-eyed intelligence of Maar. Personal 
passions merge with political ones in the weeping women, in a manner unique in 
all of Picasso's oeuvre . And LACMA's picture is where those conflicted 
passions are initially resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is of further significance because museums regularly pay empty lip 
service to the idea of exhibitions that illuminate their own collections. Like 
1989's "The Dada and Surrealist Word-Image," also organized by Freeman at 
LACMA, and which examined the historical context for the museum's famous 
Magritte masterpiece, "This Is Not a Pipe," this one actually does it -- and 
brilliantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman, who until last summer was a LACMA curator and is now in that post at 
the Portland (Maine) Museum of Art, has assembled 36 works to tell her story. 
Among them is the "Weeping Woman" from London's Tate Gallery, the greatest of 
the series, to which LACMA's runs a close second. The presentation may not be 
huge, but it's more absorbing than any number of museum exhibitions twice its 
size.

 Jackson Testifies in 'Dangerous' Case: Michael Jackson took the witness stand 
at the Denver Federal Courthouse on Monday, singing parts of his song 
"Dangerous" and testifying that he wrote its melody and lyrics. Jackson's 50 
minutes of testimony in the latest of his legal battles came as part of a trial 
resulting from Denver songwriter Crystal Cartier's $25-million lawsuit claiming 
that Jackson stole "Dangerous" from her and infringed on her copyright. Jackson 
testified that he wrote the lyrics for "Dangerous" while sitting in the dark 
and listening to the bass track of another of his songs, "Street Walker." 
Cartier, 38, claims she had sent Jackson a tape recording of her song of the 
same name before he first recorded "Dangerous" in September 1990. The song 
later became the title track for Jackson's 1992 album, which sold 14 million 
copies. Jackson testified that he doesn't listen to unsolicited tapes "because 
of the danger involved, like this situation."

 A good portion of Bobby Vinton's repertoire at the Long Beach Terrace Theatre 
on Sunday afternoon made it strikingly clear why we needed Lennon & McCartney 
in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Making a rare Los Angeles appearance, the king of early rock love songs worked 
through such Top 40 chestnuts as "Roses Are Red," "Blue on Blue," "Tell Me Why" 
and "Blue Velvet."The overflow audience clearly must have adored Vinton in the 
'60s, and they adored every minute of this performance as well.

 But what was most appealing about Vinton was not his re-creation of puppy-love 
hit tunes -- which he seemed willing to dispense with fairly quickly -- but his 
poise as a complete entertainer. Filled with energy and high spirits, 
constantly in movement, interacting amiably with his audience, Vinton almost 
produced a convincing presentation with his engaging personality, even for the 
few skeptics in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening act was Reunion -- actually a Lettermen revival group featuring 
Jim Pike and Bob Engemann from the best-known version of the trio, joined by 
Ric de Azevedo of the King Family vocal ensemble. As with Vinton, the 
Valentine's Day love-song theme dominated in their affable readings of familiar 
Lettermen hits. DON HECKMAN

JAZZ REVIEW; RONNY JORDAN'S SEPTET SIZZLES AT TROUBADOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 British guitarist Ronny Jordan, whose mix of straight-ahead jazz, pop, R&B and 
hip-hop is earning him a solid following, knows how to heat up an audience. His 
septet's sold-out show on Friday at the Troubadour was built around numbers 
that sizzled. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan, 31, delivers a dandy, luminous tone a la Wes Montgomery and ushers in 
his lines with plenty of rhythmic whammy. He scored with a no-nonsense version 
of "My Favorite Things," and a dashing romp through "Blues-grinder," where he 
cranked out one steaming idea after another. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get to Grips" and "Season for Change," featuring rapper Radical MC, were 
effective, as was the coupling of the rousing "Come to Me" with a hip-hop take 
on "So What." On these numbers, his band gave him exuberant, if overly loud, 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jordan's show faltered when he dropped in such mushy, mired-in-pop/jazz 
ditties as "Show Me" and "Tinsel Town," which paled in comparison to his other 
material. Jordan also plays Tuesday at Ole Madrid in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist Charlie Hunter, who does a swell job of playing bass lines while he 
simultaneously knocks out a solo, opened for Jordan. Hunter, vigorous tenor 
saxophonist David Ellis and spiffy drummer Jay Lane were first rate, offering a 
five-tune set of smart and lively jazz-meets-alternative-rock originals. ZAN

MUSIC REVIEW; PERLMAN OFFERS SOME PLEASANTRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some great performers take their listeners on spiritual odysseys, all the 
while enlightening them, challenging them, invigorating them. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, violinist Itzhak Perlman took his 
listeners for a stroll around the block. Everything was familiar, comfortable, 
friendly. Neither arduous music nor arduous music-making blotched the 
atmosphere of peace and tranquillity in Mr. Perlman's neighborhood. He should 
have worn a cardigan, not a tux. 
</P>
<P>
 Beethoven's congenial Sonata No. 8 in G, Schumann's urgent Sonata No. 1 in A 
minor (congenial in Perlman's hands) and, a rarity, Stravinsky's Divertimento, 
based on music from "The Fairy's Kiss" (Stravinsky at his easiest), made up the 
printed agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was when Perlman brought out a stack of music at encore time that the 
audience went into rapture, and when Perlman played some of it he seemed at his 
best. Here, in two Kreisler transcriptions, a Heifetz transcription, in Elgar's 
"Salut d'amour" and Saint-Saens' Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso, musician 
and music were in perfect harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, things proved less convincing. The 48-year-old violinist gave the 
Beethoven sonata the easy once-through, slighting its contrasts, smoothing out 
its playfulness. The giddy finale refused to take off, thanks to some 
less-than-stellar ensemble work between Perlman and his accompanist, Janet 
Goodman Guggenheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Schumann's lofty music sounded pleasant and earthbound, with Perlman offering 
all-purpose richness and lyricism yet little sense of the longer line, and a 
sometimes resourceful Guggenheim, the piano lid almost closed, too often 
settling for a supporting role.  
</P>
<P>
 Stravinsky's Divertimento found Perlman apparently more involved, lending its 
Tchaikovsky tunes a gentle warmth and curve, its Stravinskian rhythms a 
bounciness and light drive. Here, the ease of his technique added to the charm 
of the music. 
</P>
<P>
 He revealed the full sugar content of his encores, sparkled gracefully in the 
virtuoso bits, offered some mild quips in between and earned an instant 
standing ovation for the fluffiest of the fluff, the Saint-Saens standby. 
Almost everyone seemed satisfied. TIMOTHY MANGAN

JAZZ REVIEW; INTERNATIONAL SOUNDS AT TWO-DAY PARTY AT BILTMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By LEONARD FEATHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The third annual International Jazz Party, held Saturday and Sunday at the 
Biltmore's Grand Avenue Bar, followed the pattern of its predecessors. Japanese 
musicians alternated with Americans and occasionally played alongside them. 
</P>
<P>
 Eiji Kitamura, the clarinet virtuoso, was again the principal visitor, playing 
mostly traditional swing-era songs. His technique seemingly improved with age, 
he conjured up a head of steamy excitement with a solo of Benny Goodman-like 
virtuosity on "The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise." 
</P>
<P>
 Top honors Saturday went to Bruce Foreman, a guitarist from San Francisco 
graced with phenomenal fluency, who teamed with the more conventional but 
empathetic Yoshiaki Miyanou. Their guitar duets brought out the best in both 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman appeared again Sunday in a pleasant collaboration with tenor 
sax-player Scott Hamilton. They were followed by an all-Japanese group with 
agreeable but derivative piano by Kotaro Tsukuhara, drummer Sabao Watanabe and 
bassist Sammy Asami. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunday evening session came to a roaring climax with Bill Berry's band. 
With Berry conducting, playing an occasional cornet solo and contributing a 
colorfully textured original, the band succeeded in areas tackled less 
successfully last week by the Lincoln Center Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Both bands leaned heavily on Ellington material, but Berry's musicians have a 
more natural feeling for it. Only in the closing "Diminuendo and Crescendo in 
Blue" did they fall momentarily short, when Scott Hamilton's tenor sax failed 
to generate the kind of passion created last week by Joshua Redman with the New 
York ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everyone in the Berry band had significant spotlight time, most notably 
such regulars as Marshal Royal, Ross Tompkins, Snooky Young and Frank Capp. 
Other members included Supersax singers Ernie Andrews and Polly Podewell, 
pianist Gerry Wiggins, bassist John Clayton and drummer Gregg Field. LEONARD

WITH OR WITHOUT PARENTS: ACTING 'MASTER CLASSES' WITH VISITING WISCONSIN TROUPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 So, you have an 8-year-old who loves center stage? A yen to tread the boards 
yourself? Children, moms and dads are invited to pick up some acting basics 
from professional actors in two free "Master Classes" offered by the Great 
American Children's Theatre of Wisconsin at the central Los Angeles Public 
Library's KLOS Story Theatre this Saturday and next from 10 to 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In town for its L.A. tour of the L.M. Montgomery classic "Anne of Green 
Gables" at the Wilshire Theatre in Beverly Hills, Wednesday through Feb. 27, 
the theater company's cast members will present the free classes as part of a 
pilot program to promote learning through reading and the performing arts. 
Since space is limited, the classes are available on a first-come, first-served 
basis. Information: (800) 852-9772. 
</P>
<P>
 Classics for Kids: If Beethoven and Brahms are the ticket, check out "A World 
of Music," a child-sized classical concert/workshop for ages 4 and up at 
Kidspace Museum in Pasadena twice on Sunday. Pianist Polli Chambers Sazar will 
play excerpts from Chopin, Scarlatti, Rachmaninoff, Beethoven and other 
composers as part of two interactive music workshops at 2:30 and 3:30 p.m. 
Children participate through discussion and movement. Free with museum 
admission. Information: (818) 449-9144. 
</P>
<P>
 They're Not Kidding Around: Talk about an early career boost. At ages 9 to 13, 
the newest deejays at Radio AAHS' 24-hour children's radio station KPLS-AM 
(830), fit right into the station's target audience of 2- to 12-year-olds. 
Ashley McCormick, David Harris, Kyle Ellison, Mara Stringfield and Jennifer 
Gonzalez are the new stars of the all-kids show, "AirForce Kids," airing from 2 
to 4 p.m. on Saturdays. Playing music, reporting on sports, entertainment, 
education and the environment, the five were chosen from 150 applicants in 
December for their writing ability and presentation skills. Besides 
"age-appropriate music," listeners will hear critiques of books, computer 
software, music and movies, plus celebrity gossip, interviews and nature news. 
And, yes, although the budding broadcasters won't be socking away a fortune, 
they do get paid.

DANCE REVIEW; NEW GENERATION BOOSTS PEKING ACROBATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Currently on its sixth North American tour, the Peking Acrobats performed in 
Pasadena Civic Auditorium on Sunday. As usual, the company members were listed 
but not specifically identified in the house program, and the souvenir booklet 
on sale in the lobby featured a different generation of performers doing 
different tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest tour showcases very young Peking Acrobats (seven women, 15 men as 
listed) who wear lots of glamour makeup, make lots of mistakes in their 
routines and seem to be evolving toward a freer, more mobile virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, there's been a major change in the traditional pagoda-of-chairs. 
Normally, as you'll recall, furniture is stacked on the floor or a platform 
until the pile reaches the top of the proscenium. Then somebody does handstands 
off the highest point. 
</P>
<P>
 Not anymore. These days, all those chairs -- plus a bench and the youth 
handstanding on top of it -- balance on a tiny platform on a pole that a 
hunkier youth manages to support on his head. No hands. Not even when he climbs 
a ladder to walk on a giant moving ball. 
</P>
<P>
 You like Chinese dancing lions with two performers inside each costume? The 
latest pride can do backflips off high platforms and roll up-and-over 
teeter-totters with gymnasts balanced on their backs. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in Act II, male gymnasts dive through a four-level wall of wooden hoops 
-- brilliant at mid-air contortions, sudden changes of direction and 
unpredictable linkups with their colleagues. Toward the end of the program, 
however, they become the hoops, forming a high, human Great Wall of China that 
provides both apertures for others to dive through and balconies off which the 
women hang in the air and spin. 
</P>
<P>
 So it goes: an ancient ribbon-dance performed atop a high pole with the dancer 
hanging by her teeth. A contortionist balanced on the outstretched arms of a 
gymnast. New variants on familiar displays of dexterity with whips, flying 
ceramic bowls, spinning ropes, hanging straps, tiers of glasses, uni- and 
bicycles. Plus a 9-year-old boy impersonating the Peking Opera Monkey King.  
</P>
<P>
 Better keep an eye on that kid: No telling what new feats his generation has 
in store. LEWIS SEGAL

MARKET FOCUS; COLA INVASION STIRS UP INDIA'S NATIONALIST FEELINGS; SOCIALISTS 
DENOUNCE IT AS A NEW FORM OF COLONIALISM AND THREATEN TO PICKET.

 "Quit India!" 
</P>
<P>
 More than half a century ago, with the Japanese army advancing toward the 
Indian frontier and seemingly unstoppable, Mohandas K. Gandhi, the "Great 
Soul," launched the call for the British to leave his country, immediately and 
unconditionally. His target was the injustice and humiliation of colonialism. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a coalition of alarmed Indian socialists has dusted off his slogan and his 
tactics of nonviolent protest to battle a more recent foreign foe: 
"cola-onalism," the fizzy, ubiquitous drinks made by Coca-Cola and Pepsi. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the two most aggressive agencies of pushing in what I consider 
American culture. That includes a lot of things, from junk food to Madonna to 
Michael Jackson," said George Fernandes, a former minister, labor organizer and 
leader of the Janata Dal party. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the soft-drink giants leave India voluntarily by the month's end, 
starting March 1 their bottling plants and retail outlets will be picketed and 
trucks carrying their products will be blocked, Fernandes announced on behalf 
of Samajwadi Abhiyan, an umbrella alliance of socialists. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandes, responsible for driving Coke out of the Indian market in 1977 (Coke 
returned last fall), claimed that movement organizers can count on the support 
of 200,000 nationalist students in universities in the New Delhi area, as well 
as "millions" worried that jobs in Indian enterprises are in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Those forecasts seem preposterous. 
</P>
<P>
 But regardless of how many people lie down in front of delivery vans or agree 
to boycott Coke and Pepsi, the "quit India" campaign, freighted with the 
symbols and strategy of the fight against imperialism, is a reminder of how 
touchy some Indian leaders and intellectuals still are about foreign 
penetration of their once nearly hermetically sealed economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world has changed in 50 years,"' objected P. M. Sinha, managing director 
of Pepsi Foods Ltd., who claims that Fernandes and his backers just haven't 
kept up. "The country today exists in a new environment of global integration." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepsi, he said, will stand pat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quit India" redux may be one of the last gasps of the ideal of a 
self-sufficient, import-free India minted in the heyday of Gandhi and 
Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last year, a new, more open India attracted more foreign investment 
than during the whole of the 1980s. American, as well as European and Japanese, 
companies are arriving en masse. Many will watch the anti-cola campaign to see 
whether the old slogans have any life left. 
</P>
<P>
 The experiences of Cargill, the U.S. grain-trading dynasty, indicate that, at 
least in some economic sectors or regions, foreigners may be in for a bumpy 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
 The Minneapolis-based company, one of America's largest privately held 
corporations, sells hybrid sunflower and corn seed in India; in December, 1992, 
hundreds of militants attacked its office in Bangalore, looted the seedlings 
and computer records and tossed them in a bonfire outside, said Cargill's India 
general manager, Raza Hasnain. Last July, a mob was back, laying waste to 
sections of a seed-processing plant under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Cargill was targeted because of a provision in the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade, then being debated, that allowed the patenting of new 
strains of seeds. Fernandes warned at the time that multinationals like Cargill 
"will hook farmers to their products, then raise prices. In the process, our 
agricultural base will collapse." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the destruction, Cargill says that it still intends to do business in 
India. "Neither attack has deterred us from our initial intentions: We're here 
to serve the Indian farmer," said Hasnain, whose office is now guarded by a 
security agent armed with a double-barreled shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandes, who also tangled with Cargill over its proposal to create a giant 
coastal salt farm, says his concerns are economic. In an interview in the 
white-washed Delhi bungalow that serves as his command post, the bespectacled 
lawmaker claimed that over the next three years, Coke and Pepsi combined would 
siphon almost half a billion dollars in royalties and profits out of India. 
That sum, he said, would be enough to pay for the construction of 600 miles of 
broad-gauge railroad and to employ 30,000 people to run it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a country where four-fifths of the villages are without potable 
drinking water," Fernandes said. "The law of the market cannot be allowed to 
operate." 
</P>
<P>
 Although his party's clout has waned, Fernandes knows that soft-drink 
companies pay attention when he speaks. As minister of industry in the Janata 
Dal government in 1977, he demanded that Coca-Cola turn over a majority share 
of its holdings and reveal its secret formula if it wanted to continue doing 
business in India. Instead, Coke left. 
</P>
<P>
 The world's most popular soft drink returned to the Indian market last 
October, opening a bottling plant in a dusty little industrial town near Agra, 
site of the fabled Taj Mahal. That, and the Coke garden umbrellas that have 
sprouted in eateries near the Taj, is an unmistakable sign that the country 
that had battled imports to the point of developing domestic alternatives to 
Coke -- Campa Cola and Thums Up -- has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 To secure a launch pad in the Indian market, Coke entered into a $70-million 
"strategic alliance" with the maker of Thums Up, an Indian drinks manufacturer 
named Parle that boasted a 60% market share. Business insiders say the deal is 
a barely disguised takeover by Coke. Pepsi, meanwhile, has seized 24% of 
India's cola trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepsi naturally rejects the socialists' line of reasoning and arithmetic. It 
entered the Indian market three years ago, subject to a raft of government 
restrictions (including the addition of the Hindi word for wave, lehar, to its 
brand name). Its executives say that far from sucking money out of India, they 
are enriching it. 
</P>
<P>
 "In three years, we have grown to be one of the largest exporters; in the next 
five years, we should be one of the top five," said Sinha, the Pepsi manager. 
"As of today, we have almost brought in $50 million in foreign exchange. I 
don't think that in the next 10 years a single cent will go out of this 
country. We are now in an investment phase." 
</P>
<P>
 In Madras, Pepsi is building a $27-million plant to manufacture plastic 
bottles. The company just received a $20-million order to ship returnable glass 
bottles to the Persian Gulf. Pepsi also plans to open Kentucky Fried Chicken 
and Pizza Hut restaurants, thereby creating more Indian jobs, Sinha said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cola merchants look upon India with unconcealed ambition because of its 
growth potential. Soft-drink consumption averages a paltry three bottles per 
capita each year, compared to a reported 750 in the United States and more than 
1,100 in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandes says that India already has its own colas and that foreign 
concoctions are really no different, so India isn't getting any advanced 
foreign technology in return for permitting market access. 
</P>
<P>
 In a larger sense, he is concerned about India as it exists today -- a country 
where vast private wealth and 60% illiteracy and widespread poverty coexist. 
"Unless there is a return to Gandhi, we are lost," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Fernandes and his followers dusted off another Gandhian action -- 
the famed "salt march" staged by the Indian nationalist in 1930 to protest the 
British government monopoly on salt -- and used it against another Cargill 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on whom one listens to, the campaign worked, or it didn't. Cargill 
wanted to build a salt works in the Gujarati port of Kandla and promised the 
Indian government to export its entire 1-million ton annual output of 
industrial salt. The government gave its approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their plant would have meant massive unemployment in the salt sector, where 
150,000 Indians are employed," Fernandes claimed, disputing Cargill's 
contention that it would not produce for the domestic market. He launched a 
civil disobedience movement he says mobilized 20,000 people in Uttar Pradesh 
state alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasnain acknowledges that Fernandes did slow the project. But there were other 
factors, he said, including suspicions by some Indians of CIA involvement. The 
clincher proved to be the economic downturn experienced by Japan, the plant's 
target market. When it became clear that Japan wouldn't be able to absorb an 
additional million tons of industrial salt, Hasnain said, Cargill shelved the 
idea, at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Pondering the arguments of socialists like Fernandes, India-born Hasnain 
rejects them as having failed miserably. "Our umbilical cord always was to the 
Soviet Union. We regarded foreign investment as an enemy. And look where we are 
today," the Cargill executive said. "In 1960, South Korea and India had the 
same gross domestic product per capita. Today, South Korea's is 10 times 
higher."

THE WEEK AHEAD: BUENOS AIRES; OIL OVER THE ANDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Presidents Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina and Patricio Aylwin of Chile 
officially open a new pipeline today that will carry Argentine petroleum over 
the Andes to the Chilean port of San Vicente, near Concepcion. 
</P>
<P>
 The 260-mile-long, $230-million line, built in 15 months, provides an 
important outlet for the oil fields of Argentina's southern Neuquen province 
and low-cost transportation for Chilean oil imports. Argentina produced more 
than 200 million barrels of oil in 1993, exporting about 20% of it. Chile 
imports most of its petroleum; its national production has fallen by about 40% 
in the past 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 After opening the spigots, Menem and Aylwin will fly to Concepcion for further 
ceremonies and meetings.

 Of the 31 Anglican provinces worldwide, 12 already ordain women -- including 
those in the United States. But the issue has prompted an outcry in England, 
making it perhaps the most divisive since the establishment of the church more 
than four centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading prelates have argued that the move clashes with English church 
tradition, and some have taken drastic measures. Preliminary approval has 
resulted in several prominent Anglican prelates seeking acceptance within the 
Roman Catholic Church, which still bans female priests.

<P>
 British Prime Minister John Major meets today in Moscow with Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin for talks centered on the West's involvement in the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd, Major is expected to assure the 
Russians that the Western powers do not intend to become deeply embroiled in 
the military situation around Sarajevo. Aides in London say the British leader 
will try to persuade Yeltsin that the NATO decision to threaten air strikes 
against Bosnian Serb forces around the embattled city was justified and to seek 
Russian support as a step toward resolving the crisis. The Russians have 
supported the Serbs, who are fellow Slavs, in the conflict.

REGIONAL OUTLOOK; THE WELFARE COSTS THAT ARE DRAGGING DOWN...EUROPE; THE 
CONTINENT'S 'GOOD LIFE' IS GETTING TOO EXPENSIVE, TOUCHING OFF PROTESTS AND 
STRIKES.

 Life is good for Myriam Gerard, Alain Dubois and their little family. 
</P>
<P>
 With two incomes, they net $3,500 every month, own their own home in the city 
that calls itself the capital of Europe and enjoy the benefits of Belgium's 
liberal welfare democracy -- the 13th-month salary (an extra month's pay each 
year), the 14th-month salary (a second extra month's salary each year minus 
15%), automatic inflation-indexed pay increases, a company car, free gasoline, 
a gift from the state of $850 for the birth of each child, subsequent child 
benefits, food stamps and, of course, six weeks annual vacation, heavily 
subsidized medical care and the security of a generous state pension. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty miles west of the Gerard-Dubois home, in the small Flemish town of 
Lembeke, Karel Boone finds the going tougher. He struggles to keep his 
family-owned cookie business from sinking under wage costs that he says have 
gone out of control. "If this doesn't change, there's going to be a catastrophe 
in our country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Brussels, Jan Smets, who heads the Belgian government's Cabinet 
office, sits in a room a few doors down from Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene 
and mulls the problem of how to rein in a national debt that in relative terms 
is already more than twice that of the United States and growing fast. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gerard-Dubois benefits, Boone's struggle and Smets' dilemma are all part 
of a painful reality that has spread far beyond the borders of this tidy little 
nation to afflict virtually all the democracies of Western Europe: The 
tax-supported welfare states that have anchored the region since World War II 
can no longer be sustained. That realization is making political waves that 
have washed into the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 While the deepest recession in decades has played its part, the crisis that 
grips Western Europe's social democracies goes far deeper than any economic 
downturn. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the difficulties lie in the worrisome structure of the welfare state 
and intractable problems such as rapidly aging populations, a large and growing 
army of long-term, hard-core unemployed and spiraling health care costs. All 
have increasingly sucked up resources, driving the welfare bill to untenable 
levels. Traditional sources of funding such as payroll taxes can no longer bear 
the load. Wage costs in the region have gone so high that they are beginning to 
price Western Europeans out of competitive world markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall of the Iron Curtain just over four years ago was the final straw, 
unleashing a new flow of immigration that has swamped already strained Western 
welfare systems and placing an array of cheap industrial goods at Western 
Europe's doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've reached the top of the flagpole," former Economics Minister Otto Graf 
Lambsdorff of Germany warned his country's Parliament in a speech last year. He 
called Germany's network of social benefits "too expensive, too inflexible, too 
static, insufficiently entrepreneurial and dynamic." 
</P>
<P>
 Although his comment was directed at Germany, it was valid for the entire 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've hit the peak; we're looking at the downhill side," Tony Vandeputte, 
chief executive officer of the Federation of Belgian Enterprises, said in an 
interview. "Even within the trade unions and elsewhere on the political left, 
people are aware that dramatic changes are needed." 
</P>
<P>
 For Western Europe, the idea of questioning the welfare state is an emotional 
process that represents far more than a discussion on how to resolve an 
economic crisis. The debate touches the very foundation on which the Western 
Europeans have built their post-World War II social order. 
</P>
<P>
 The region's generous welfare systems have not only erased poverty as a social 
blight, they have provided the glue of social cohesion and stability. And 
during the postwar decades, these social safety nets have become a part of a 
collective identity, one that Western Europeans believe sets them apart from 
industrial societies in America and Asia. (Belgian official Smets, for example, 
in trying to explain his country's basic commitment to the welfare state, spoke 
of "the very European idea of solidarity.") 
</P>
<P>
 Western Europeans have carved out a level of affluence that matches that of 
most Americans, and they have provided for everyone along the way. That ideal 
is now cracking under the weight of economic imperatives. The budget cutting 
has already begun, and the only certainty about the future is that deeper cuts 
will follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most radical rollbacks so far have come in Sweden -- the nation 
whose mixture of affluence, welfare and social justice dates from far earlier 
in the century. Since taking office in late 1991, conservative Prime Minister 
Carl Bildt has pushed $20 billion in government spending cuts through the 
Swedish Parliament, reducing maternity and sick leave benefits, introducing 
small fees for medical services and making citizens contribute to their own 
pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 More fundamentally, the very value of complete, comprehensive welfare as a 
social good -- once an unquestioned given -- is undergoing a rethink. A report 
published last year by the Swedish Ministry of Finance drew a troubling 
conclusion: 
</P>
<P>
 "What was considered as a central achievement of the Swedish welfare state 
only a couple of decades ago is now being evaluated differently. Costs have 
skyrocketed, while effects on economic growth . . . have been increasingly 
detrimental."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A reduced work ethic characterized by alarmingly high absenteeism, an 
unemployment rate that has increased sixfold in five years and the 
industrialized world's highest per capita budget deficit all helped contribute 
to this conclusion, as did the country's sharply reduced growth over the last 
two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The re-evaluation in Sweden has been an important signal for Europe 
psychologically, because it served as a model to many of the war-torn nations 
of Western Europe in the late 1940s and early 1950s as they searched for new 
vision in a post-fascist era. It was from Sweden, for example, that influential 
leaders such as Germany's Willy Brandt and Austria's Bruno Kreisky carried home 
new political ideas gathered during their wartime exile there. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, governments throughout the region are following Sweden again -- this 
time in the politically unpleasant task of taking away what they once gave so 
generously. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, the reaction has been intense. Late last year in Germany, 
steelworkers demonstrated against the abolition of guaranteed lifetime liberal 
unemployment benefits. (A four-year limit was placed on them instead.) Later, 
more than 100,000 angry construction workers descended on Bonn to protest a 
government decision to abolish "bad weather money" -- a government subsidy 
established during the late 1950s that effectively pays workers even when 
weather conditions shut down a building site. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with growing budgetary strains, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government has 
cut education support, begun to shift health care costs onto the consumer and 
reduced unemployment insurance. It has yet to confront the implications of an 
aging population on the country's welfare system. One in every four Germans 
will be over 65 by the third decade of the next century, decreasing the 
economically productive percentage of society. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, employers, straining under the costs of benefits they help finance, 
are telling trade unions the era of big wage hikes has passed. "The idyllic 
life is over; turbulent years are ahead," the leading German news weekly, Der 
Spiegel, predicted in its 1993 year-end issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture is similar elsewhere: 
</P>
<P>
 * In France, since his election last May, Prime Minister Eduard Balladur has 
frozen public service wages, extended the number of working years required to 
draw a full state pension from 37.5 to 40 years and said he hopes to trim more 
than $500 million from health care spending this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Italy, over the next decade, the minimum legal retirement age will be 
increased by five years to 65 for men and 60 for women as a way of cutting 
pension costs. But fraud remains rampant, and the government has yet to crack 
down on a system that is estimated to dole out some form of pension to more 
than one-third of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Spain, which embraced the welfare state wholeheartedly only with the 
Socialist election victory in the early 1980s, reductions in health care and 
jobless benefits triggered a national general strike last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Many experts believe that the cuts so far represent the beginning, not the 
end, of a painful, socially sensitive process. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle in Belgium is an example with parallels throughout the region. 
Despite the fact that 47% of the country's national income flows into 
government coffers, it is no longer enough to finance what over the years has 
become one of Europe's most comprehensive welfare systems. 
</P>
<P>
 For Belgium, the price for this luxury has become the highest national debt 
(in relative terms) in the industrialized world and a system of financing 
benefits that many argue has become counterproductive. For example, 
private-sector employers such as Boone, the man with the cookie business, claim 
that the costs of welfare benefits are now so high they have become a 
disincentive to employ new people. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had a new product with a guaranteed market but that product was 
labor-intensive to make, I would be a fool to launch it here," Boone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Prime Minister Dehaene's coalition government, which includes a number of 
Socialist ministers, agrees that wage costs must come down. Last year, Dehaene 
launched an austerity program that included a wage freeze in real terms, a cut 
in child benefits, a cap on health care spending and a retroactive tax 
surcharge. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to shift some of the burden of benefits financing away from 
industry, the government has also agreed to cut business contributions to 
welfare in half for low-wage employees. It hopes to make up the difference by 
increasing indirect taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 What industrial leader Vandeputte called "a very cautious beginning" -- and 
the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development dismissed 
as wholly inadequate -- was nonetheless viewed as a disaster by trade unions. 
They called Belgium's first general strike in 58 years last November to protest 
and have vowed to continue the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Little wonder that other politically sensitive areas, such as the extremely 
high civil service pensions (90% of working salary for the lower-paid employees 
and 80% for others), remained untouched. "We are going to live through more and 
more social unrest," predicted Robert Voorham, national secretary of the large 
FGTB trade union. "The (economic) pressures from Central and Eastern Europe 
have only just begun." 
</P>
<P>
 Voorham agreed that wage costs must drop but insisted that the existing 
welfare net can -- and must -- be preserved by a combination of new indirect 
taxes and serious government attempts to cut down on tax fraud. He argued that 
trimming the welfare state at a time of record unemployment would risk new 
tensions that could rupture the fragile social peace that exists between 
Belgium's 5.5 million Dutch-speaking Flemings and its 4.5 million 
French-speaking Walloons. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just can't do that here," he said. "There's too much cultural, 
nationalistic conflict." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Xavier Mabille, director of the Center for Socio-Political Research and 
Information here, went further, claiming that repeated government calls for 
more sacrifice run the danger of discrediting the entire political mainstream 
and driving voters to the extremist right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Europe is becoming a powder keg," he said. "The fires have already started in 
some places." 
</P>
<P>
 But not all are so pessimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in Denmark, the government has found a new source for financing its 
expensive welfare system: exporting its expertise. So far, revenues are 
admittedly modest, but the Danish Social Affairs Ministry has formed a company 
called Exsos (Export of Social Systems) and landed contracts in eastern Germany 
for setting up retirement homes for the elderly and in Estonia to assist in 
building that country's first social security program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not exporting the level of our welfare--we're selling our know-how," 
stressed Leif Lytken, the ministry's chief consultant on the venture. "There's 
a lot of good opportunities out there." Tallying Up the Welfare State The 
Employer 
</P>
<P>
 Gross salary is just part of an employer's cost in Western Europe. Karel 
Boone, DEO of Corona-Lotus, a medium-sized producer of cakes and cookies in 
Belgium, provided this braeakdown for an average employee, using the salary as

THE WEEK AHEAD: MOSCOW ; THE YELTSIN AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Boris N. Yeltsin is scheduled to give his first Russian version of a 
State of the Union address on Friday, as required by the country's newly 
adopted constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking for widespread acceptance, he has invited lawmakers from both houses 
of Parliament, members of his Cabinet, leaders of all the republics in the 
Russian Federation, foreign ambassadors and the press to hear the speech in the 
Kremlin's Marble Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The president is expected to lay out his legislative and political agenda for 
the first time since he crushed a revolt by hard-line lawmakers last October. 
His administration is taking special pains to cultivate the new Parliament, but 
early indications suggest that the Duma, or lower house, may prove as hostile 
to Yeltsin as the Supreme Soviet he dissolved.

 Last week's decision by NATO countries to deliver an ultimatum to Bosnian Serb

as President Clinton declared that the warplanes will attack if the guns are

NATIONAL AGENDA; HONEYMOON IS OVER FOR TURKISH PRIME MINISTER; AFTER A SLEW OF 
SETBACKS, TANSU CILLER'S POLITICAL RIVALS ARE CHALLENGING HER LEADERSHIP. 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS IN MARCH WILL TEST HER PARTY'S POWER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Few people go to Sarajevo to get away from it all, but Turkish Prime Minister 
Tansu Ciller's recent solidarity visit to the embattled Muslims of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina must have seemed almost a relief after a disastrous January 
that has almost derailed her 7-month-old premiership. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even applause from her countrymen and the outside world for her brave 
defiance of Bosnian Serb gunners in the Sarajevo hills could quite put Turks 
back under the spell of 47-year-old Ciller and her ever-present television 
smile, foreign diplomats and Turkish commentators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the end of the Ciller dream," said one foreign envoy in Ankara, the 
Turkish capital, where knives are being sharpened by her embittered rivals for 
leadership of the center-right True Path Party, which leads Turkey's coalition 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 January dealt blow upon blow to this Muslim country of 60 million people, 
which has tried to present itself as an island of stability and secular 
government astride a devil's triangle of the Balkans, the Caucasus and the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 The Turkish lira dived almost 20%, the stock market crashed to half its dollar 
value, interest rates shot up and an inflation rate of 70% seems set to rise 
sharply. Police beat demonstrating civil servants, and the U.S. State 
Department again criticized its NATO ally's human rights record, citing torture 
and excessive use of force by officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the human rights violations allegedly occurred in Turkey's ethnically 
Kurdish southeast, where another 273 people were killed in January in the 
nation's ever-bloodier 10-year-old conflict with separatist Kurdish rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey also saw its hopes set back of creating a Turkic commonwealth with five 
former Soviet states that share dialects of the Turkish language. The six -- 
Turkey, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan -- 
failed to hold a planned summit in Baku, Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
 Disorganization and the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict played a part in the 
postponement, but pressure from a resurgent Russia also played a role. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, in yet another blow to Turkey's ambitions, its first satellite had 
to be destroyed shortly after takeoff, victim of a rare fault in the European 
Ariane rocket program. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no need to panic. These problems are nothing to what we have faced 
before," President Suleyman Demirel kept repeating in public speeches. With 
grass-roots dynamism feeding an estimated 7% growth in its gross national 
product in 1993, it is true that Turkey is in a much better position than its 
last major financial-political crisis the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 That period was capped in 1980 when Turkey's armed forces staged their third 
coup in 20 years, arresting Demirel and an entire generation of squabbling 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The army may be worried again now. But it appears to receive everything it 
wants from Ciller and has huge statutory influence in government. Diplomats do 
not expect it to intervene directly in the latest crises. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the latest financial problems have proved the resilience of Turkey's 
free foreign-exchange regulations and a stock exchange that many experts deemed 
the world's No. 2 emerging market last year. Foreign investors are sensing a 
buying opportunity as Turks feed on gloomy sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The future of the market may not be clear, but foreign investors are coming 
back in. Shares are now very cheap," said Hakan Ulutas, a broker at Istanbul's 
Ottoman Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 But such considerations take little pressure off Ciller as she plunges toward 
the test that will decide her political future: nationwide municipal elections, 
scheduled for March 27. The former economics professor's headstrong nature and 
inexperience made her seem fresh and strong but have proved a disastrous mix. 
</P>
<P>
 In one example, the Central Bank last month wasted $180 million supporting the 
Turkish lira just hours before the currency was devalued by 12%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bulent Gultekin, Ciller's hand-picked governor of the Central Bank, resigned 
his post in protest over what he termed the poor communications and bad 
decision-making associated with the lira defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government decision-making system is completely locked up," Gultekin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Altan Oymen, chief commentator of the nationalist daily Milliyet, observed: 
"It's not a question of there being no coordination in government. There is not 
even dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of recent events, Gungor Mengi, an editorialist with Turkey's 
biggest-selling newspaper, Sabah, searched his soul for an explanation as to 
why he and others had been so enthusiastic when Ciller was chosen to be 
Turkey's first woman prime minister in June. "As our old proverb says, 'Those 
who fall in the sea will embrace a snake.' The fact that we embraced Ciller was 
just another mistake of our adventurous character," Mengi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey fell into the sea when the main architect of the country's reforms 
since 1980, President Turgut Ozal, died last April. Ozal left Turkey 
deregulated and dynamic, but with mounting financial and political problems 
that needed careful management if they were not to burst out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 A consensus is growing that if the March municipal elections show a collapse 
in public support for Ciller's center-right True Path Party, then general 
elections should be conducted sooner than the planned 1996.  
</P>
<P>
 Ozal's Motherland Party, now led by Mesut Yilmaz, leads Ciller in polls. But 
ideological differences between the two parties are so small they are each 
running candidates poached from each other in the mayoral race for Turkey's 
biggest city, Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either by the ballot box or by party executives, the two big center-right 
parties must be made one for political stability," said Hasan Cemal, a 
left-wing editorialist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the absence of such a strong lead, even Ciller has said her supporters are 
drifting off to the pro-Islamic Welfare Party. Some polls say the Islamists are 
now the second party, backed by the most energetic house-to-house activists in 
Turkish politics and financial support from Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 As the discredited political classes snipe at each other in their struggle for 
lucrative patronage, the bureaucracy is gridlocked, and the state's financial 
problems continue to mount. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 budget deficit was triple its target. Up to a fifth of the budget is 
being spent on the war against Kurdish rebels, tax revenue is inadequate, a 
flood of imports have sent the trade deficit off the chart and privatization 
has failed to solve the problem of overstaffed and inefficient state 
industries.  
</P>
<P>
 "With these policies, neither inflation nor interest rates will fall," said 
Sakip Sabanci, a leading Turkish industrialist. "I'm afraid that the mistakes 
will make both of them rise. Politicians now think of nothing except running 
after votes. (Democracy) no longer tastes so good." Turkey's Troubled Month 
January dealt several setbacks to new Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, left, and 
her nation's image as an island of stability amid the turbulent Middle East, 
Balkans and Caucasus: * 
</P>
<P>
 * Turkish lira dived almost 20%. * Stock market crashed to half its dollar 
value. * Interest rates shot up. * U.S. State Department criticized Turkey's 
human rights record -- especially in ethnically Kurdish southeast. * A summit 
between Turkey and five former Soviet states fell through, hurting Turkey's 
hopes for creating a Turkic commonwealth. * Turkey's first satellite had to be 
destroyed shortly after takeoff.TURKEY

CULTURE; EGYPT UNWRAPS A DISPUTE ON ANTIQUITIES; IS IT WORTH THE RISK ANY MORE 
TO SEND PRICELESS TREASURES ABROAD? SOME EXPERTS SAY NOT, AND A CAIRO COURT HAS 
DEMANDED THE RETURN OF AN EXHIBIT FROM JAPAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 His golden face, serene in its youthful majesty, has enchanted millions who 
sought in it a glimpse of Egypt's Pharaonic past. But ever since Egypt's King 
Tutankhamen treasures went on traveling exhibit at museums around the world, 
there has been a nagging question about the famous burial mask: Is it real? Or 
was it switched? 
</P>
<P>
 The longstanding suspicion that a fake mask was substituted in an exhibit in 
Japan -- a rumor ridiculed by most Egyptologists but that persists nonetheless 
-- has fed a growing tide of discontent here over the country's traveling 
antiquities exhibits. It now threatens the future of Pharaonic exhibitions 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 In a case brought by archeologists and academicians who fear Egypt is risking 
its cultural heritage by sending it out on the road, a Cairo court ruled 
earlier this month that a major new exhibition of Egyptian antiquities in Japan 
is illegal and ordered its immediate return. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision raises doubts about Egypt's ability to send its prized 
antiquities to international museums, a program through which millions have 
discovered the treasures of the country's 5,000-year-old civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal battle underscores growing political rifts within the Egyptian 
Antiquities Organization, which oversees archeologists and adventurers from 
around the world and some of the most priceless antiquities in the Middle East. 
It is an authority already rife with intrigue and ferocious back-biting. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy has raised serious questions in Egypt, a poor, populous nation 
seeking to capitalize on its heritage to boost its revenues. Critics ask: How 
much is the country risking its ancient treasures in an effort to make them 
more accessible to the international public and more lucrative for the 
government? 
</P>
<P>
 Egyptian officials say the items are pointless if no one sees them. They say 
the international exhibitions of Pharaonic treasures have not only raised 
millions of dollars in revenues but boosted tourism and opened a window on the 
world to Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have built up in the last 20 years with these exhibits a wonderful image 
of Egypt in the outside world. It helped us very much in letting the world 
understand our point of view, to understand Egypt's role in the Middle East, 
especially after its peace treaty with Israel," said Mohammed Saleh, director 
of Cairo's Egyptian Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents include Aly Radwan, dean of archeology at prestigious Cairo 
University, and others who believe that the money and prestige Egypt earns by 
sending its antiquities abroad are not worth the risk to a heritage that is 
priceless. 
</P>
<P>
 Neemat Ahmed Fouad, professor of Egyptology at Helwan University and a 
well-known writer on archeological issues, argues: "There is now a diarrhea of 
these exhibits, and for what? We are sending away to every country in the world 
the most precious gifts we have. Do we knock on everybody's door and say, 'Here 
are our antiquities, take them'? Or do we wait for people to come here to see 
them?" 
</P>
<P>
 The underlying feelings in the debate go back to the last century, when 
Egyptians watched helplessly as European and American archeologists uncovered 
the secrets of Egypt's past and carried them away to museums and galleries 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1952 revolution that eliminated Britain's influence in Egypt also brought 
a new sense of nationalism to Egyptology, and foreign archeologists work in 
Egypt now only under strict controls. The antiquities organization is 
controlled by a cadre of experienced Egyptian professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Farouk Hosni, the culture minister and an artist with strong ties to the West 
who has been behind the move to open up Egypt's culture to Western 
sensibilities, has run afoul of the nationalist tide in the current debate; the 
controversy has focused not only on foreign exhibitions but also on expanding 
public use of Egyptian temples and monuments for theater performances and 
concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 A storm erupted over the ministry's plans to build a 17,000-seat amphitheater 
at the base of the Sphinx -- a plan later withdrawn. Another blew up when the 
ministry tentatively talked about concerts at the temple of Hatshepsut in 
Luxor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The department has turned a deaf ear to the cries of all concerned lovers of 
Egypt and of Egyptian art and history," said newspaper columnist Mohammed Shebl 
in a "Stop the Concerts!" plea two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can people sleep safely at night with nightmares of 'megaspeakers' thundering 
the 'Ode to Joy' and the aroma of freshly grilled steaks, competing for 
livelihood with age-old colored drawings of Horus and Anubis, while the 
admiring claps of thousands of spectators slap the pharaohs and queens of Egypt 
across their faces?" he demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Fouad, sitting in her Cairo apartment cluttered with old vases and paintings, 
was more succinct in her discussion of the culture minister's plans for Egypt's 
antiquities. "If the devil was in his place," she said, "he would not destroy 
Egypt like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Egypt's exhibitions abroad began in the modern era at the Exposition 
Universale in Paris in 1867, when the nation dispatched figurines of the 
Pharaoh Khafra and Sheik al Balad and the jewels of Queen Iah-Hotep to the 
international fair. 
</P>
<P>
 But the showings really took off beginning in 1976, when the treasures of 
young King Tut attracted enthusiastic American and British audiences, amassing 
$9 million for Egypt. The Tut exhibit appeared at the Los Angeles County Museum 
of Art in 1978. It was followed by a growing number of international exhibits, 
including "Egypt Today"; "The Golden Pharaoh," a popular collection of items 
from the period of Ramses II, and "Pharaohs' Gold." 
</P>
<P>
 The current 72-piece exhibit of items depicting the lives of Egyptian women 
from the Old, Middle and New Kingdoms, "The Ancient Queens of Egypt," debuted 
last week at the Edo-Tokyo Museum; it contains some of the museum's most 
valuable items, including sculpted heads of Hatshepsut and Cleopatra. 
</P>
<P>
 An administrative court in Cairo ruled the antiquities are the "property of 
the Egyptian people and state, and transferring their ownership to an authority 
or organization, which would deal in them, is inconceivable." It said it was 
the responsibility of the president of Egypt to approve all programs for 
outside exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
 In arguing their case, archeologists have pointed to a history of damage -- 
most of it minor -- to antiquities exhibited. The harm includes breakage of the 
headpiece of the goddess Selkit in the King Tut exhibit (the work later was 
restored); after the Ramses II exhibit in America, experts found that 22 items 
in the 25-piece collection had damage, mostly scratches; a 1988 Australian 
display left some pieces discolored (that too was later repaired). 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, damage can happen anywhere. Even in the museum here, when you are 
cleaning a showcase, it can happen," said Abdel-Halim Nureddin, director of the 
antiquities organization. "We have had a few cases where there was a kind of 
slight damage. A scratch. Because of that, we have insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tokyo exhibit is insured for $24.5 million and will earn Egypt about $1.7 
million. Egyptian authorities emphasize it does not include, as critics allege, 
masterpieces from the museum in Egypt. Rather, they said, it features statues 
similar to some of the best-known pieces but of lesser quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the antiquities organization said they would immediately appeal 
the court ruling; in the interim, they plan to leave the Tokyo exhibition in 
place.

NEXT STEP; ISRAELI SEES TOURISM AS PEACE DIVIDEND IN MIDEAST; CABINET MINISTER 
UZI BARAM WANTS JOINT VENTURES BY ISRAELIS AND ARABS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Israeli Tourism Minister Uzi Bara looked up from the lunch table with eyes as 
wide as his future vision of the profits that peace will reap. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he said, will come the Christian pilgrims -- millions of them from the 
world over, flocking to the holy sites where Jesus was born, where he lived and 
died -- the fruits of the recent peace between Israel and the Vatican after two 
millennia of estrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the Muslims will come, flocking to the rock where the Prophet Mohammed 
rose to heaven, filling Jerusalem's gold-domed Al-Aqsa Mosque in a pilgrimage 
that, for decades, has been just a distant dream for most. 
</P>
<P>
 The minister can see it all, joint-venture resorts, sprawling spas, towering 
hotels and beach clubs -- built, owned and run by Arabs and Jews together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Already there is one project in the works on the Dead Sea," said Baram, who 
describes himself with pride as "one of the leaders of the dovish wing" of 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 "But my idea is different. I am talking about an entire international tourism 
area run by Jordanians, Israelis and Palestinians, with major hotel chains and 
five-star facilities. I was even thinking about a package tour -- Mecca, Medina 
and Jerusalem -- the holiest shrines of Islam." 
</P>
<P>
 Such, it seems, are but a handful of the infinite prospects peace would bring 
to an ancient yet disputed land so long in conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 True, Baram conceded, his vision remains in the talking stage, as Palestinian 
and Israeli negotiators still appear at least several weeks away from a final 
agreement to begin Israel's promised troop withdrawal and Palestinian self-rule 
in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. And, Baram is the first to admit, "So far, it is 
just thinking. We didn't do much to make it concrete yet." 
</P>
<P>
 But the minister is convinced that the march the Arabs and Jews have begun 
toward peace now is irreversible. And Baram is not alone in his vision. In 
fact, as their leaders continue to haggle out the toughest, last details of 
peace between Israelis and the Palestinians after decades of occupation, 
rebellion and death, Baram's proposed Arab-Israeli resort on the Dead Sea is 
just one of many examples of concrete cooperation between Arabs and Jewsquietly 
taking shape at the grass-roots level in Jerusalem and throughout the occupied 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the positive images of a quietly emerging peace that have been lost 
amid the simmering scenes of hostility and violence as delays in the autonomy 
plan have fueled frustration and despair. They are the images of hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Sunday, for example, rehearsals began in the Al Kasabi Theater in East 
Jerusalem for a joint, Arab-Israeli production of Shakespeare's "Romeo and 
Juliet." Arab producer George Ibrahim said Romeo's family of Montagues will be 
played by Jews from an Israeli theater company in West Jerusalem; Juliet's 
Capulets will be portrayed by Arabs from Ibrahim's East Jerusalem troupe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very deliberate," Ibrahim said of his drama. "The play, after all, is 
about stopping hatred. We are saying with this play, 'Stop the killing and 
bloodshed, and we will have peace.' 
</P>
<P>
 "For decades, we knew the Israelis only through the soldiers, the police and 
the guns. They knew us only through the intifada (Palestinian uprising), the 
stones and the anger. I think now it's time to start with different aspects." 
</P>
<P>
 Ibrahim, who worked on Israeli productions before the intifada began eight 
years ago, conceded that, in the disputed city of Jerusalem, politics is never 
far away. The undecided final venue for the play, which is scheduled to open in 
May, is a case in point. Ibrahim said he hopes he can stage it "somewhere in 
the open air" where Arabs and Jews can gather together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to let Arab and Jew work together," the producer said. "Of course, we 
will have some problems, because each group will bring their culture with them. 
But we have to start somewhere, and I believe that through culture it is the 
best way to start." 
</P>
<P>
 Per Erik Johansen could not agree more. He is the manager of a Norwegian rock 
band who spent last week auditioning Palestinian and Israeli rockers in East 
and West Jerusalem. His vision: a joint Palestinian-Israeli concert sponsored 
by the Norwegian government. The original plan of his government, which helped 
broker last September's historic declaration of the principles for peace, was 
to stage the Woodstock-style festival in a newly autonomous Jericho. "We hoped 
to have the concert in the spring, but this may be difficult now," Johansen 
said, adding that the prolonged political negotiations to establish that 
autonomy may force the organizers to hold the concert on neutral ground -- in 
Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 It is in the higher-stakes realm of corporate joint ventures -- projects such 
as Baram's proposed Dead Sea resort -- that cooperative efforts will prove most 
difficult. The Dead Sea resort is a prime illustration. Baram's idea for the 
model project surfaced briefly late last month when Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shimon Peres, the government's chief negotiator, brought it up in Palestine 
Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat in Davos, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Peres called me and said, 'A Palestinian will call you up' to discuss the 
project," Baram recalled over lunch. "So far, he didn't call." 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, though, Baram's director general, Eli Gonen, interrupted to say 
how highly both Israelis and Palestinians view the potential for joint-venture 
tourism -- financially, as well as symbolically -- not merely in Jericho and 
Gaza but in the disputed city of Jerusalem and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been several informal discussions and informal meetings between 
top officials of our ministry and representatives of Palestinians dealing with 
tourism," Goren said. "We spoke about joint planning . . . and we decided to 
plan together the entire region -- where to have five-star hotels, where to 
have three-star hotels, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Formally, the next meeting of the joint Israeli-Palestinian economic 
committee in Paris, in fact, is going to be focused entirely on tourism. You 
see, we are sure this region will be flooded with tourists, when this problem 
between us will all be settled." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, he explained, the Israeli government spends about $100 million a year 
to promote tourism and develop tourist sites in Israel and the occupied 
territories. Last year, it paid off. A record 2 million tourists -- for the 
first time, half of them Christians -- visited the holy lands and generated 
revenues of nearly $3 billion, according to tourism ministry figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Baram then described just how far his vision extends -- far beyond the 
Palestinian autonomous zones to an era of peace between Israel and all of its 
Arab neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of ideas for joint tourism -- opening the gate between Eilat and 
Aqaba (to link the beach resorts of Israel and Jordan), sending a lot of 
Israeli pilgrims to Petra (Jordan's most famous ancient site)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Baram seemed to catch himself in midflight. He paused and reflected for a 
moment. "To be on the safe side, of course," he said, "We have to wait for all 
that until we have a peace treaty with Syria." Future Tour? Israel's tourism 
minister, Uzi Baram, envisions a package tour of Islam's holy sites that would 
bridge the Israeli and Arab worlds. Baram also hopes to see the gate opened 
between Eilat and Aqaba, and Israelis visiting Jordan's Petra.

DOING BUSINESS; AMERICAN RIDES WAVE OF SURF BOOM; A SECLUDED SPOT IS NOT SO 
SECLUDED ANY MORE, THANKS IN PART TO A FORMER LAGUNA RESIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gregg Henderson has found a surfer's paradise, a house five minutes from some 
of the best waves in South America, well-shaped beauties, rarely crowded. He 
has a little surfboard factory and shop that earn enough for him and his 
Chilean wife to live on. He helps organize an occasional surfing contest, and 
he rides the waves whenever he wants. 
</P>
<P>
 What more could a boy from Laguna desire? 
</P>
<P>
 On an overcast Saturday morning in the South American summer, Henderson is 
wearing shorts and a T-shirt, looking out from a rocky point at endless sets 
rolling toward a distant beach. Only a half-dozen surfers can be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last summer was the first time I saw anything here that resembled a crowd," 
he says. "I counted and there were 25. In California it would be 150." 
</P>
<P>
 But he worries about that. Maybe he shouldn't be doing so much to promote 
surfing in Pichilemu. Maybe he should try to keep it more to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I'm helping to create too much of a Chilean crowd here," he 
says. "The sport is just booming now. It's happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Since he opened his Seawolf Surf factory last March, he has sold about 100 of 
his custom-made boards for more than $300 each. When he helps local merchants 
organize a contest, 5,000 people show up to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 The surf at Punta de Lobos (Wolves' Point), about three miles south of town, 
can be spectacular on good days: waves of 15 feet and higher. It isn't always 
that big, but there is usually something to catch, Henderson says. "This is 
like California, but with consistent surf." 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson, 34, grew up in Laguna. He began surfing young and loved the sport 
but hated the struggle on a crowded wave, he says. "I quit surfing in 
California when I was 20 because I was sick of getting in fights in the water." 
</P>
<P>
 He attended universities in Colorado, California and Hawaii. He worked as a 
carpenter, surfboard maker, bartender, cook and ski instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, he left California, headed for Latin America in his pickup. He took 
his time -- a year -- surfing Central and South American beaches along the way. 
On the snowy Andean slopes east of Santiago, the Chilean capital, he found work 
as a ski instructor and met his wife-to-be. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santiago, he went looking for Chilean surfers, then a rare breed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found about 10," he says. "One of them brought me here. We showed up here 
and it was breaking. It was so good I freaked out. And here I am." 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, about eight years ago, the waves of Punta de Lobos were empty. 
But now, middle-class Chilean youths are suddenly discovering surfing. They 
often start surfing on beaches west and northwest of Santiago, but they soon 
find Pichilemu. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any Chilean who surfs, surfs here," Henderson says. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfer magazine, published in California and distributed internationally, has 
printed information on Pichilemu, including a full article about two years ago. 
"Now," he says, "people come from all over the country and all over the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The word is out. Pichilemu is in. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, he says, about 40 foreigners have come to surf, and if the 
water here were warmer there would be more. The Chilean coast is washed by the 
cold Humboldt Current, which comes from Antarctica, and wet suits are 
customary. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the water here is no colder than Northern California's, Henderson says. 
"Guys from Santa Cruz say the water is identical." 
</P>
<P>
 Pichilemu fell from fashion decades ago as a beach resort. It is 150 miles 
southwest of Santiago by road, some of it rough and unpaved. Most of the 
visitors were provincials, and they did not bring much money. But the surfers 
still come. 
</P>
<P>
 An organization of local merchants called Friends of Surfing has sponsored 
annual contests since 1990. Washington Saldias, vice president of the Pichilemu 
Chamber of Tourism and a founder of the club, says more than 30 foreign surfers 
have participated in each contest, and many more Chileans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a public attraction because of the publicity it gets on television and 
in the press," Saldias said. The media coverage has given millions of Chileans 
a glimpse of the town's quaint charms, including horse-drawn taxis called 
cabritas , and its many miles of gray-sand beaches, interrupted by picturesque 
outcroppings of brown rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the publicity, more tourists are coming. New motels and restaurants 
are opening. A four-story apartment building, Pichilemu's first "high-rise" 
building, is near completion. And a Chilean businessman is looking for 
financing to build a four-star hotel, Saldias says. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to make Pichilemu into a mini-California," said an article in the 
Sunday magazine of El Mercurio, Santiago's leading newspaper. "And they are 
succeeding." 
</P>
<P>
 The road into the town is being fully paved, and land prices are skyrocketing. 
Henderson says his lot is worth 10 times what he paid for it 3 1/2 years ago. 
It lies on three acres of piney slopes near Punta de Lobos. The house is a 
trilevel, California-style home with wood siding and decks. A geologist from 
Santa Barbara has bought a nearby lot and a cardiovascular surgeon from Santa 
Cruz is eyeing another one. Both are surfers, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surfing has revitalized this town," Henderson says. "I knew it was going to 
boom with surfing, but I never had any idea it would be this fast. The 
merchants are stoked." 
</P>
<P>
 One businesswoman especially stoked is Adriana Padilla, owner of the small 
Hotel Chile-Espana, where many foreign surfers stay. When she began operating 
the hotel four years ago, Padilla says, it received 10 or 15 surfers a year. 
"Now there are 50 a year." 
</P>
<P>
 She looks through the day's page in her registry and finds six Australians, 
three Argentines and two Brazilians. Two Frenchmen have just arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surfing has made Pichilemu known around the world," Padilla says. "When they 
make comparisons of the surf, many say it is like a second California." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Eady, an electrician from Australia, is staying at the Chile-Espana. 
After a day in the water, his face is sunburned and his eyes are red. 
</P>
<P>
 "Came here about three weeks ago," Eady says. "Just doing a little surfing 
trip." He says he plans to stay for two months. Two friends from Australia, 
also electricians, have recently flown over to join him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The surf is great," he says. "The waves are very good quality. Probably the 
best thing is that the ride is very long, so there can be a lot of surfers on 
the water." 
</P>
<P>
 Just after lunch, Henderson is staring out at Punta de Lobos from a table in a 
restaurant. "The waves are pretty big now. Surf's up, definitely," he says. "I 
should be out there."

 "This is pretty good, hard to beat, but I've found places that are just as

ENVIRONMENT; FURY GREETS CHILE'S PLAN FOR A RIVER; A HUGE HYDROELECTRIC DAM 
THREATENS A WAY OF LIFE FOR THE PEHUENCHES PEOPLE. IT SYMBOLIZES THE STRUGGLE 
BETWEEN DEVELOPMENT AND PRESERVATION.

 In the mountain watershed of the Upper Bio-Bio River dwell wide-ranging 
communities of Pehuenches, the Araucaria Pine People. When autumn unfurls the 
cones of the araucaria pine, families move through the woods gathering its 
nuts, an important part of their diet. They cherish and protect the stately 
tree almost as kin. 
</P>
<P>
 "To cut down an araucaria pine is like putting a mother to death, because that 
is what feeds our people," explained Jose Antolin Curriao, a Pehuenche 
chieftain. Such ancient traditions may soon be tested in a time of change on 
the Bio-Bio. 
</P>
<P>
 Curriao and other Pehuenches are alarmed by dam construction on the river, 
fearing that their homeland of wooded mountains and roaring rivers, the essence 
of their culture, will be spoiled forever. 
</P>
<P>
 After futile protests and failed legal suits by opponents of development, 
workers and machines already are building the Bio-Bio's first hydroelectric dam 
near this village, 300 miles south of Santiago. A much bigger second dam, still 
in the planning stages, would displace some 1,800 Pehuenches from their 
ancestral lands, their supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our community would disappear," said Curriao, 60. "We want to follow the 
example of our ancestors. We don't want to disappear." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pehuenches are not the only ones worried about dam projects on the 
Bio-Bio. Sports enthusiasts, for instance, have flocked to the river in recent 
years because it provides a spectacular white water rafting experience. But its 
most thrilling rapids will be inundated if the second dam is built. 
</P>
<P>
 Ecologists, meanwhile, warn that important habitats for some species of fish 
and other wildlife are endangered by the dam projects, which also will put 
pressure on the fragile alpine environment flanking the river. University 
engineers who have studied the area say dams could disrupt the ecological 
balance of the whole Bio-Bio basin, one of Chile's most important river 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 An environmental organization called Action Group for the Bio-Bio is leading 
the campaign against the hydroelectric projects, and the Bio-Bio has become a 
prime symbol of the contest between economic development and environmental 
preservation in South America. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of decades ago, few people in South America worried about protecting 
wilderness areas from the onslaught of development. That was a problem for 
North America, where vast natural tracts had been tamed in the name of 
progress. The process was still young in the southern reaches of the 
hemisphere; the desire for development overshadowed environmental cautions 
here. In recent years, however, South Americans have awakened to the dangers of 
degrading their natural environment as environmental and conservation movements 
have gained increasing strength and influence. 
</P>
<P>
 The shrinking Amazon rain forest has received much of the attention, but 
Amazonia is not the only part of South America where nature is in trouble. From 
the majestic Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in Colombia to the chill forests of 
Tierra del Fuego, ecological damage is advancing at often alarming rates. 
</P>
<P>
 There is so much wilderness in South America that it sometimes seems hard to 
focus on piecemeal destruction and localized threats. In southern Chile, 
hydroelectric dams on several formerly pristine rivers are a widely accepted 
part of this country's impressive development thrust. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chilean economy has grown at an average of more than 6% a year for the 
past decade. More energy is needed to keep the economic dynamo turning, and the 
southern rivers are an abundant source of power. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, however, development also is beginning to pollute the clear waters 
of many southern Chilean lakes. And chain saws are ripping through native 
forests, already shrunken by earlier settlement and exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle over the Bio-Bio has become an emblematic showdown partly because 
it is a historic frontier as well as a strikingly beautiful river that tumbles 
down jagged Andean canyons in a torrent of blue crystal and snow-white froth. 
It also stands out because the fate of a unique native culture may be at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pehuenches are among Chile's poorest people, but their culture is rich in 
traditions rooted in the Andean lands where they gather nuts, herd flocks of 
sheep and goats, and grow wheat and other grains. They belong to the Mapuche 
nation, which kept Spaniards and Chileans at bay along the Bio-Bio frontier 
until the 1880s, when an military offensive against the Mapuches opened the way 
to settlement south of the river. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of this century, southern Chile developed slowly. But a national push 
for export growth in recent years has brought rapid growth in the south's 
agricultural, fishing, fish-farming, wood and cellulose industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Endesa, a formerly government-owned power company that was privatized in 1988, 
has been keeping pace with development by increasing the generation of 
electricity. And the Upper Bio-Bio River, with its huge hydroelectric power 
potential, is a resource that Endesa wants to exploit. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on the Bio-Bio's first dam, called the Pangue, began in 1993 and 
is scheduled to be finished in 1997. It is budgeted at $470 million and will 
produce 450 megawatts of electricity. Its reservoir will cover 1,200 acres, 
flooding nearly nine miles of the river's course, including several miles of 
scenic and raftable rapids. 
</P>
<P>
 But hydraulic engineers at Chile's University of Concepcion say the 
environmental impact of the Pangue dam may be greatest on the Lower Bio-Bio. 
Andrea Nardini and Hernan Blanco, engineers with a university environmental 
research center, say the dam may reduce the river's flow to a trickle in some 
places on summer days. "To dry up a river means killing its ecosystem," Nardini 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the upper Bio-Bio, the impact is clear. Pangue S.A., a subsidiary of Endesa 
that is building the dam, acknowledges that it will be "unfavorable" for some 
river fish, including two endangered species of native catfish. In a recently 
published brochure, the company also admits a "possible increase of erosion and 
deforestation in the basin" of the river because of increased water in upland 
areas around the dam. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few Pehuenches will be displaced by the Pangue, but its influence on 
nearby native communities has been the subject of heated debate. The company 
brochure says the dam may lead to accelerated loss of Pehuenche cultural 
identity, if countermeasures are not taken, but argues that it will help 
relieve the extreme poverty of the communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Pangue S.A. says the project will provide up to 2,500 jobs at the peak of 
construction and the reservoir will be a valuable future center for 
income-producing recreation and tourism. In response to criticism, the Endesa 
subsidiary has created foundations for promoting community development and for 
ecological preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is in the interest of Endesa that the environmental impact be the least 
possible," said Esteban Skoknic, a company planning engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 The chieftains of two Pehuenche communities on the Upper Bio-Bio have taken 
jobs with Endesa and support the dam project, but five others oppose it. "We 
don't want to work for Endesa," said one, 82-year-old Manuel Neicuman. "We want 
them to leave our lands alone so that we can pass them on to our sons." 
</P>
<P>
 Neicuman, Curriao and three other Pehuenche chieftains gathered on a recent 
Sunday at a cabin downstream from the Pangue construction site. With them was 
Rodrigo Valenzuela, an anthropologist with the Action Group for the Bio-Bio. As 
the chiefs drank red wine and ate spoonfuls of spiced and coagulated goat blood 
in preparation for a late outdoor lunch of roasted goat, Valenzuela told a 
visitor that converting Pehuenche men into low-paid construction workers would 
unravel their cultural link to the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the extent that the Mapuche loses his ties to the earth, he is losing part 
of his identity," the anthropologist said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pangue is more than one-third finished and impossible to stop, its opponents 
concede. Preliminary plans for the second Bio-Bio dam, called Ralco, have 
recently been submitted by Endesa for consideration by the National Energy 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralco's reservoir would cover more than 8,000 acres, dwarfing the Pangue lake. 
Valenzuela said Ralco would displace 300 Pehuenche families; Skoknic said 
Endesa estimates that 90 families would have to be moved. 
</P>
<P>
 But Valenzuela emphasized the impact would not be limited to displaced 
families. With Ralco, much more of the Bio-Bio's beautiful and ecologically 
unusual canyons and valleys would be inundated, as would those of some 
tributary rivers. With new roads, land companies would buy up acreage and 
lumbering would spread into previously inaccessible areas, he said. More roads, 
more construction jobs and more outside influence would undermine Pehuenche 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "In economic, social and cultural terms it is the end of a people, its 
extermination," said Valenzuela.

 Point guard Kevin Johnson of the Phoenix Suns once invented an evil alter ego 
for himself, he told Arizona Republic columnist David Casstevens, a 
fast-talking bad guy named Mevin Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put these dark glasses on and start talking slang, like a hip-hop guy," 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Casstevens wonders if the alter-ego bit is carrying over to Johnson's play on 
the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "KJ doesn't have a split personality," Casstevens writes. "However, his 
involvement in two ugly incidents on the court have led some to wonder about 
him. . . . Dear Sweet Kevin almost removed Steve Kerr's face in the closing 
seconds of last week's nationally televised Suns-Chicago Bulls game. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . Maybe this wasn't Kevin. Could it be his other half taking over? 
'Yeah,' KJ said. Like a B horror movie, the suggestion amused him. He thought 
of Mevin. Evil triumphs over good. 'Good guy turns bad.' "

 Greg Foster is still in the record books. Two days after Britain's Colin 
Jackson thought he broke Foster's 60-meter hurdles record of 7.36 seconds, 
embarrassed track officials acknowledged that Jackson had only tied the mark. 
</P>
<P>
 A review of the photo-finish print from Jackson's run Saturday at a 
Britain-U.S. meet at Glasgow revealed that his time was fractionally slower

NOTEBOOK; TRANSPORTATION AGAIN EMERGES AS MAJOR GLITCH

<P>
 Some observers, remembering the transportation problems that plagued the Lake 
Placid Winter Olympics in 1980, figured the same thing might happen here, where 
the arrangements are much the same. And it did. 
</P>
<P>
 But, officials are saying, the problem has been rectified. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 spectators arrived late for the men's downhill skiing event Sunday 
at Kvitfjell because of long bus lines -- gold-medal winner Tommy Moe's father 
and stepmother nearly missed his big moment because of that -- and about 100 
figure skating fans in Hamar were stranded until early Monday morning because 
they were unable to get onto overcrowded buses. 
</P>
<P>
 Private transportation has been cut off in the Olympic region and Games 
spectators must rely primarily on buses supplied by Olympic organizers. That 
kind of arrangement fell apart at Lake Placid because there were not enough 
buses, and for much of the first week of competition, fans were left fuming in 
parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday was a better day here, according to Einar Spurkeland, duty officer at 
the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee's transport section. 
</P>
<P>
 "We redeployed 20 buses at our disposal, which enabled us to transport 38,000 
spectators to the various venues," Spurkeland said, adding that buses to the 
cross-country ski stadium, the luge and bobsled track at Hunderfossen and the 
Alpine skiing area at Kvitfjell all were on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who arrived too late to see Sunday's skiing will receive ticket refunds. 
Another 50 to 100 who turned back when they realized they could not get to 
Kvitfjell on time, will also get refunds.

 Because he won the Olympic downhill, everyone wants a piece of Tommy Moe. Make 
that an exclusive, please. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kelly, director of media relations for the U.S. ski team, is trying to be 
diplomatic. Monday night, Kelly had to deny interview requests from Norwegian 
and German national broadcast networks. "They didn't take it well," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem is, there's only one Moe to go around. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday was a whirlwind. Moe didn't wrap up his day until 10 p.m. He did two 
separate interviews with print reporters, three segments for CBS and a live 
spot with CBS' "This Morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday morning, after five hours' sleep, he finished third in the downhill 
portion of the Alpine combined. Later, he had to cancel a scheduled television 
spot with TNT because of a training schedule change for the men's Super-G. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing like a ski race to mess up a television career. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For winning the gold, Moe will receive $15,000 from the U.S. Olympic 
Committee. "All right!" said Moe, who wasn't aware of the USOC's cash prize 
schedule. "Thanks for that news. That's pretty surprising. It made my whole 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moe, an Olympic champion for less than 48 hours, already pines for the days 
when he can rest on his laurels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was down in New Zealand this summer and I saw Franz Klammer and Bill 
Johnson and a lot of the top skiers from the past," he said. "And they were 
smoking cigars and having a good time, and I said, 'That's the way to do it. 
Retire from ski racing and go play golf and smoke a cigar.' " 
</P>

 AJ Kitt, who finished 17th in Sunday's downhill, did not race in Monday's 
combined downhill. He will ski in Thursday's Super-G, then return home to rest 
before the World Cup races in North America next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't have a good downhill here, but I'm not going to give up on the 
guy," said Ueli Luthi, the U.S men's coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitt has long been the most consistent U.S. downhill racer, and remains the 
only American to have won a World Cup downhill since Bill Johnson in 1984. Kitt 
also won the bronze medal in last year's World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Kitt knows that in America, they only remember Olympic champions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Luthi said Moe's downhill success will be a tremendous boost for the U.S. 
team, which has been under fire of late. "It was a great victory," Luthi said. 
"It came at the right time. It was one of the first Olympic events, Mrs. 
Clinton was here. The political side kind of zoomed in on our sport. There were 
not 200 other sports going on. The benefits will be great." CHRIS DUFRESNE

 Garth Snow will make his Olympic hockey debut tonight, one game earlier than 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow will replace Game 1 starter Mike Dunham when the United States faces 
12th-seeded Slovakia at Gjovik Cavern Hall.Coach Tim Taylor's tentative plan 
was for Dunham to start the first two games and switch to Snow for the third 
game against Canada because of the latter's strong record against Canada, but 
the plan was changed after Monday's practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunham, who alternated in goal with Snow at the University of Maine, played 
capably in Sunday's 4-4 tie against France. Although rarely tested severely, he 
made several crucial saves during a French power play in the waning minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunham has faced Slovakia once, in a 5-5 tie on Nov. 21 during the Telehockey 
Cup tournament at Lillehammer last November. Snow has never faced Slovakia. 
Snow is 4-1-0 against Canada with a 3.01 goals-against average and .903 save 
percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've said all along that we have a strong goaltending tandem in Mike Dunham 
and Garth Snow, and we've said all along that both players would contribute," 
Taylor said. "We saw how well Mike is capable of playing for us in the final 
minutes of our game against France. It's now Garth's turn." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow, 24, has already made his NHL debut. He was 3-2 during a brief stint with 
the Quebec Nordiques. "Slovakia is a really solid team," Snow said. 
"Offensively, they're probably up there with us. Maybe they don't have quite 
the speed we possess but they're good, especially Peter Stastny. He's really 
smart with the puck." HELENE ELLIOTT

FANTASTIC FINNS ROUT RUSSIANS, 5-0; HOCKEY: BIG RED-FACED MACHINE HANDED ITS 
WORST OLYMPIC DEFEAT BY CONFIDENT FINLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new world order is dawning in hockey, signaling the end of the Big Red 
Machine and the rise of the glacial blue and arctic white of Finland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Finns, who long lacked the assurance to match their world-class skills, 
scored the most significant victory in their hockey history Monday with a 5-0 
rout of top-seeded Russia. It was the first Olympic shutout, and worst defeat 
absorbed by a Soviet team or its descendants. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Group B games Monday, Germany improved to 2-0 with a 2-1 victory over 
Norway, and the Czech Republic defeated Austria, 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The Soviet Union won seven of nine gold medals from their Olympic debut in 
1956 through 1988; the Unified Team, born after the Soviet dissolution, 
continued the tradition in 1992. Together, the Soviet teams and the Unified 
Team were 60-6-2 and had lost only once by more than a goal, an 8-5 defeat by 
Canada in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia won its tournament opener Saturday against Norway but was overwhelmed 
Monday. The seventh-seeded Finns have never won an Olympic or world 
championship, but they have impressively defeated two higher-seeded opponents 
here. Finland opened Olympic play Saturday with a 3-1 victory over the Czech 
Republic, the tournament's third-seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really happy about it (because) I don't think you have so many chances 
to shut the Russians out," said Finnish right wing Mikko Makela, a former King. 
Makela set up the fourth goal with a perfect pass from behind the net to Janne 
Ojanen, who slipped a backhander between the legs of goaltender Andrei Zuev. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did a good thing tonight and we have a chance to do well, but we only have 
played two games and we still have seven more," Makela said. "We never had 
confidence before, but now we have some NHL experience (on) our team and that 
has helped us. We try to tell the young players they are something, because 
they are. Now, we play a mental game more than we ever did before." 
</P>
<P>
 Every facet of their game was superb Monday. They neutralized seven Russian 
power plays, built a 28-11 edge in shots on goal and produced several goals 
that would make the highlight film of any hockey league. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Finnish team was stronger and faster today," said Igor Dmitriev, Russia's 
assistant coach. "We were not ready for this level of play. . . . The game of 
our goalie (who was replaced by Sergei Abramov after two periods) was not so 
bad. The game of the old (experienced) guys was not so good and not good for 
this level of play." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a lofty level, three fast and exciting periods in which the Finns used 
the broad ice surface -- 100 feet wide, 15 feet wider than most NHL rinks -- to 
outskate the Russians.  
</P>
<P>
 If the 8,751 in Hakon Hall were entertained by Finland's first goal, a 
backhander by Jere Lehtinen while in a crowd in front of the net, they were 
dazzled by the second goal. It was a brilliant sequence that started when Janne 
Laukkanen intercepted a pass by defenseman Sergei Sorokine along the right-wing 
boards in Russia's defensive zone. Laukkanen found Ville Peltonen in the left 
faceoff circle, and Peltonen made a quick pass to Saku Koivu, the Montreal 
Canadiens' top draft pick last June, for a dead-on shot from the slot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Finns' 1-7 Olympic record against Soviet teams was forgotten Monday. Mika 
Alatalo gave Finland a 3-0 lead with his 12-foot rebound at 11:32 of the second 
period. Ojanen, a former New Jersey Devil, added a flourish with his second 
tournament goal, at 19:03, and defenseman Marko Kiprusov turned the game into a 
rout 10 seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very, very satisfied with the team now," Finnish assistant coach Hannu 
Aravarta said. "It's almost touching how the players are fighting for pucks. 
They are giving 110%." 
</P>
<P>
 Finland owes much of its success to first-year Coach Curt Lindstrom, a Swede 
who formerly coached the Swedish national team. Lindstrom has instilled 
confidence in Finn players through constant positive reinforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm working very much since training camp in August with individual 
discussions to make them stronger mentally," Lindstrom said. "My main key word 
is not only self-confidence but confidence (in general). I try to give them 
confidence and an understanding they must take responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "They work with heart now. Skills, we have. I try to tell them they are good 
enough to beat any team." 
</P>
<P>
 Without question, they were good enough Monday.

L.A. UNIVERSITY BEAT / WENDY WITHERSPOON; USC'S WOMEN SWIMMERS SPORTING NEW 
LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Add a couple of world-class swimmers and one of the world's most highly 
respected coaches to your college program and look what happens: You start 
breaking traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 That is what Mark Schubert has done in his first year as coach of the USC 
women's swimming team. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is why USC defeated UCLA, 163-135, Saturday at UCLA for the first 
time in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans' improvement starts with Schubert, coach of the 1992 U.S. Olympic 
women's team. He took over the USC men's program in '92 after leading the Texas 
women's team to two NCAA titles and two second-place finishes in four years. 
Schubert took over the USC women's program as well after former USC women's 
coach Darrell Fick resigned after last season. 
</P>
<P>
 In 23 years as a club and collegiate coach, Schubert has placed 22 swimmers on 
Olympic teams. 
</P>
<P>
 And the next Schubert-trained woman to reach an Olympic team figures to be 
USC's KristineQuance. 
</P>
<P>
 Quance, the nation's top recruit last spring, decided to attend USC when she 
heard that Schubert would be the coach. Quance set an American record in the 
200-meter breaststroke in December at the U.S. Open, and has a good chance to 
become the Trojans' first NCAA women's champion since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Swimming in consecutive events Saturday, Quance won the 200 butterfly in 
2:00.27 and the 200 breaststroke in 2:15.65. 
</P>
<P>
 Another talented swimmer for USC is sophomore Ayako Nakano, a 1992 Japanese 
Olympian from Yokohama, Japan. Nakano finished fifth in the 200-yard freestyle 
and ninth in the 100 freestyle at last season's NCAA championships. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the biggest name at USC these days is Janet Evans. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-time Olympic gold medalist is in her second season as a student 
assistant coach, and is training with the Trojan Swim Club while completing her 
undergraduate work in communication. 
</P>
<P>
 Having the likes of Schubert, Quance, Nakano and Evans hanging around the pool 
has charged the atmosphere at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that has pleased me the most is the way the upperclassman have 
responded to the new people who have come in," Schubert said. "The whole team 
has really raised itself to a new level, which has really been a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 USC next competes in the Pacific 10 Conference women's swimming championships 
at Belmont Plaza Pool in Long Beach, beginning Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is how much tension there was at Saturday's USC-UCLA dual meet: 
</P>
<P>
 Both schools' top teams in the 400 medley relay were disqualified for false 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps adding to the tension was the fact that UCLA Coach Cindy McCullam 
Gallagher swam under Schubert's guidance at the club level. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The transition from high school to college is not always smooth for athletes, 
but it has been for Quance, who finally has time to relax. As a student at 
Granada Hills High, she had two hours of commuting time every day to swim 
practice at CLASS Aquatics in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to that, college life is a breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, I just get up and walk over to the pool," Quance said. "For me, it's a 
lot easier, and I schedule my classes around my swimming and around my nap 
time. I just think it has worked out really well." 
</P>
<P>
 But Quance does not exactly live a life of leisure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think because of the improved conditions, she can put more time into some 
of the other areas that she wasn't able (to do before)," Schubert said, "which 
I think is going to make a big difference in her speed." 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Pepperdine women's swimming and diving team will compete in the Pacific 
Collegiate Swim Conference championships Wednesday through Friday. The Waves' 
top individual performers are sophomore Jennifer Antimarino in the freestyle 
middle distances, sophomore Becky Early in the 200 individual medley, junior 
Ericka Keithly in the 100 and 200 backstroke and 200 individual medley, and 
junior Evy Wild in the sprints. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick McLaughlin, Loyola Marymount men's volleyball coach, was named coach of 
the U.S. national boys' volleyball team, the U.S. Volleyball Assn. announced 
last month. McLaughlin is in his second season as Loyola coach and is the 
younger brother of USC coach Jim McLaughlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Local golf teams are beginning their spring seasons. The Pepperdine men 
finished tied for sixth place with New Mexico in the Arizona Invitational last 
week, and sophomore Kevin Marsh tied for second place with Patrick Lee of 
Oklahoma and Marcus Jones of Texas at eight-under-par 205 on the 54-hole 
Randolph Park golf course. . . . Pepperdine will play in the 24-team Big Island 
Intercollegiate tournament at Waikoloa Kings golf course at Waikoloa, Hawaii, 
Saturday through Monday, along with UCLA and USC. . . . The USC and UCLA 
women's golf teams will open the spring season in the Arizona Invitational at 
Tucson Monday and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Former UCLA gymnasts Scott Keswick and Chainey Umphrey placed second and 
fourth, respectively, and UCLA sophomore Steve McCain was 10th in the Winter 
Cup Feb. 4-5 at Colorado Springs to earn a spot on the U.S. national team. 
Keswick and Umphrey also qualified for the World Championships in April and the 
Goodwill Games in July.

GIRLS' BASKETBALL; THE WORST PART MIGHT BE OVER FOR 23-0 MISSION HILLS ALEMANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR

<P>
 Melissa Hearlihy feels good about her team's chances in the Southern Section 
girls' basketball playoffs, which begin this week. She figures the toughest 
part is past. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearlihy is the coach at Mission Hills Alemany (23-0), the top-seeded team in 
Division II-A. The Indians will play host to Anaheim Katella in a first-round 
game Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a difficult road to the playoffs for Alemany. Hearlihy skipped 
four games in December because of the birth of her first child. Then the school 
was condemned after last month's earthquake. Classes are being held at a nearby 
seminary, while the team practices in Burbank and plays all of its games on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials must now try to come up with a site for Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Pairings were released Monday in 10 divisions. This year's field has 231 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 All wild-card games and first-round games in three divisions will be played 
Wednesday. Everything else will start Saturday. The tournament concludes with 
finals on March 4-5. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's pairings look similar to last season's. Defending State Division I 
champion Lynwood is seeded No. 1 in Division I-AA. Brea-Olinda, which has won 
three consecutive state titles, is No. 1 in III-AA. Ventura Buena, which won 
the I-A championship last season, is that division's top-seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
 Pairings were set mainly along geographical lines this year because officials 
wanted to lessen anticipated travel hassles and increased costs caused by the 
Jan. 17 earthquake.

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: VIOLENCE SHOULD HAVE NO PLACE IN PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Let's hope that the high school basketball playoffs, which begin today, are 
without any of the ugly incidents that have occurred this season. There have 
been too many cases of unnecessary shoving, punches thrown and benches cleared. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches have become too abusive to officials, and in some cases, to each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 High school basketball in the Southland is looking more like the game on the 
collegiate and professional levels, and we are not talking about the caliber of 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 There are numerous examples: 
</P>
<P>
 --Last month, assistant boys' coaches at Santa Ana Mater Dei and Dana Hills 
got into a fight before a game and had to be separated by campus police at UC 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 --A week later, Dean Bradshaw, boys' coach at Simi Valley, was suspended for 
grabbing one of his players and shoving him to the floor during a game against 
Westlake. Bradshaw is suspended for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 --Three weeks ago, players, coaches and fans came onto the court of a boys' 
game between Gardena Serra and Santa Monica St. Monica. One parent was arrested 
for carrying a concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 --A similar incident took place last Tuesday in a boys' game between Riverside 
Poly and Riverside Rubidoux. A fight involving players, coaches and fans broke 
out in the third quarter, and officials called the game. 
</P>
<P>
 --The Long Beach St. Anthony boys' team had violent incidents at two of its 
games last week, and Southern Section officials are investigating. 
</P>
<P>
 Punishments have been left to the individual schools and leagues and have 
ranged from suspensions to reprimands. In most cases, however, they have not 
been tough enough. Sitting out one game for fighting is too easy. How about 
five games? 
</P>
<P>
 Fans who get involved in tussles should be barred from the gymnasium for the 
rest of the season. Coaches who fight or are thrown out of the games should sit 
out at least a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hope high school sports can be different than the rest of our society," 
said Mike Vanta, boys' basketball coach at Riverside Poly. "But I think that 
may be a little wishful thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Three days after his son set a national prep record for most three-point shots 
in a game, Stan Bickley was not offering any apologies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team wanted Chad to get the state record for three-pointers," said 
Bickley, boys' basketball coach at Santa Maria Valley Christian. "We didn't 
really think or imagine anything beyond that." 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Bickley, a 6-foot junior point guard, made 20 of 35 three-point attempts 
and finished with 89 points in a 130-48 victory over Cuyama Valley at Valley 
Christian. The 20 three-pointers is a national record, the 89 points a state 
record. Chad's previous high was 39 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only have eight players and they all played," Stan Bickley said. "We 
didn't press on defense and we didn't try to run up the score. We would have 
scored that many points whether Chad played the whole game or not. It was never 
our intention to rub their nose in it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Brea-Olinda girls' basketball team, which has won three consecutive state 
titles, enters the Southern Section playoffs this week on a roll. The Ladycats 
(25-0) have won their last five games by an average margin of 75 points. It 
started with a 112-23 victory over Anaheim on Feb. 1 and ended with a 110-16 
victory over Anaheim Savanna last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach John Hattrup, who replaced Mark Trakh last summer, said he is not 
embarrassed by the big margins. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sad thing is that most people look at those scores and assume we're just 
running up the score," Hattrup said. "And that's not at all true." 
</P>
<P>
 Hattrup said all 12 of his players get into most games and the reserves often 
score more points than the starters. In lopsided games, starters are normally 
pulled in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Hattrup said his reserves are better than most starters on other teams, a 
sentiment echoed by opposing coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Brea's junior varsity team would be a strong contender in our 
league," said Lori Giroux, Anaheim's coach. "Their program is just that good." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 College recruiters are finally knocking on the door of Sarah Hagman, a senior 
basketball player at Crescenta Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 They are coming to watch the 5-foot-9 guard, who has been setting various 
three-point shooting records this season. The latest occurred Wednesday, when 
Hagman made four three-point baskets in a victory over Pasadena. That gave her 
115 for the season, breaking the Southern Section record of 112 set by Amee 
Pina of Chino last year. The state record is 169, set by Danielle Vigilone of 
Fair Oaks Del Campo in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagman also holds the Southern Section record for most three-point shots in a 
game with 13 against Arcadia last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Prep Notes

 Theaters: Iwerks Entertainment has agreed to design and build four "Turbo Tour 
Theaters" featuring ride simulation equipment for family entertainment 
complexes being developed by Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. The locations of 
the centers have not yet been disclosed. Iwerks added that it plans to produce 
films to screen exclusively at the Blockbuster theaters.The theaters will allow 
viewers to watch a film while the seats move in a way that makes the audience 
feel as if it's moving along with the action on the screen. For Blockbuster, 
which recently announced a merger agreement with Viacom Inc., the deal is part 
of the company's strategy to expand beyond its main video rental business and 
into such areas as the development of large family entertainment centers.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: JOB INSECURITY PERVADES PARAMOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Viacom Inc. poised to take control of Paramount Communications, rumors 
surfaced on Monday that company President Stanley Jaffe and studio chief Sherry 
Lansing are already scouring Wall Street for funding to revive their film 
production company. 
</P>
<P>
 Others flatly denied such a move, which would violate their contracts. But 
sometimes even bad speculation speaks to the mood of an industry -- which in 
this case gives many of Paramount's top executives little or no chance of 
keeping their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 People who do business with Paramount widely expect Viacom Chairman Sumner 
Redstone to reshape the company in his own image after the dust has cleared 
around the $10-billion deal. There are two reasons for that: One is that new 
owners almost always assign their own lieutenants to carry out new management 
plans -- often as part of a cost-cutting strategy. The other is that 
entertainment executives traditionally have no job security, even under the 
best circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount Chairman Martin Davis has already largely taken on a caretaker's 
role, following a court decision that voided his friendly merger agreement with 
Viacom. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaffe has also conceded that he's on slippery ground, since Redstone has a 
strong No. 2 man in Viacom President Frank Biondi. While no one's confirming 
anything publicly, sources say the temperamental executive is examining several 
job possibilities. One report had Jaffe, an avid sports fan, trying to arrange 
financing to buy Paramount's two professional teams -- basketball's New York 
Knicks and hockey's New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaffe declined comment on Monday. A Paramount spokesman responded by saying: 
"None of the assets are for sale, and we don't comment on speculation." 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, Jaffe and Davis won't go hungry. One report valued Jaffe's 
exit package of stock and stock options at about $60 million, and Davis's at 
$155 million. 
</P>
<P>
 If Jaffe goes as expected, many people take for granted that he and Lansing 
will resume their production partnership, while resulted in successes such as 
"Fatal Attraction" in the 1980s. But the studio chief's fate may not be so 
clearcut. 
</P>
<P>
 People close to Lansing say it's wrong to assume that she would necessarily 
reunite with Jaffe. Some see her going her own way. Others say that Redstone 
might even decide to leave Lansing in place if the studio continues to make 
headway during the next three to six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Redstone could also keep Lansing around for continuity, since the studio has 
had three chairmen in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Lansing is personally popular with other Hollywood executives, and analysts 
are high on upcoming films such as the third "Naked Gun" installment, "Beverly 
Hills Cop 3" and "Clear and Present Danger." 
</P>
<P>
 With more than a dozen movies set to go into production this year, Lansing 
also has fostered relationships with such A-list producers such as Gale Anne 
Hurd ("Terminator 2"), Walter Hill ("48 Hours"), Barry Levinson ("Rain Main") 
and the team of Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy, who previously worked with 
Steven Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The studio chief, who was in Indiana on Monday for a premiere of "Blue Chips," 
Paramount's next release, had no comment on speculation about her future. 
Sources close to Lansing, however, said it's only natural to conclude that she 
presently "has no job security," as one put it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost certain Sherry will go," another source maintained. "There may be 
a polite period where she hangs in there. But with Stanley out either way -- 
which has been made clear -- there's no motive for Sherry to stay and work for 
Redstone." 
</P>
<P>
 Lansing's modus operandi so far has been to operate the studio as usual. "It's 
more than business as usual there," said one executive close to the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Lansing survives, however, many people close to the company fear that 
there will be mass upheaval in Paramount's legal and business affairs 
departments -- since Viacom has its own fully staffed divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves Paramount Television Group Chairman Kerry McCluggage, who might 
also be toppled under some doomsday scenarios. One school of thought has Viacom 
putting all of Paramount's television operations, under Biondi or MTV head Tom 
Freston -- who's seen as being on a fast track at Viacom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Viacom already knows the TV market and syndication business," one source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's also a reasonable argument to be made that Viacom will leave the 
television operation in place, since it's operating so successfully. 
Paramount's network programs include "Frasier" and "Wings." In the lucrative 
first-run syndication market its programs include "Entertainment Tonight," "The 
Arsenio Hall Show" and two Star Trek spinoffs.

 Meet the new boss: Ted Turner, Hollywood's newest mogul, addressed his troops 
for the first time at a meeting at the Cinerama Dome Theatre on Sunset 
Boulevard last week. The meeting brought together employees from his New Line 
Cinema, Castle Rock Entertainment and Turner Pictures. Turner reportedly had 
many words of encouragement, but no word on who will head Turner Pictures, 
which has been up in the air for months. "We're still working on that," said 
one executive.

SCOTT HARRIS: 'MR. EARTHQUAKE' AND THE LIVES NOT LOST; WITH QUAKE SAFETY BACK 
ON THE FRONT BURNER, BERNSON NOW HOPES TO SEE THESE QUAKE PROGRAMS RESTORED. HE 
ALSO HOPES FOR NEW ORDINANCES . . . 
</P>

<P>
 To look at City Hall, you'd think that Los Angeles is in a state of official 
mourning. The flag is not at half-mast but, nearly one month after the quake 
that claimed 61 lives, the upper floors of the white landmark tower remain 
wrapped in a kind of black band. 
</P>
<P>
 This is actually nylon netting hung to catch crumbling chunks of facade -- an 
expression not of grief but prudence. 
</P>
<P>
 We practice prudence so we don't have to practice grief. And though much has 
been said about how lucky Los Angeles was that the Northridge earthquake struck 
while the city was sleeping, how the death toll would have been far greater, 
it's also true that some prudent quake codes adopted in the last decade 
probably saved many lives Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In normal times, seismic safety isn't sexy politics. But then Councilman Hal 
Bernson isn't a sexy politician. If you are familiar with the Jeff MacNelly 
comic strip "Pluggers," suffice to say that Hal Bernson is a plugger. But if 
any politician deserves credit for making L. A. semi-ready when the earth 
moves, it's Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
 It was ironic, then, that Bernson's district would be hit harder than any of 
his colleagues'. As one veteran council aide put it: "He's Mr. Earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the vaulted chamber of the City Council one recent day, downing a quick 
sandwich while waiting to chair a meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee on Earthquake 
Recovery, Bernson remembered on the happenstance that helped make him City 
Hall's champion of quake preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
 The year was 1979. Freshman council members, as Bernson was at the time, are 
not given plum committee assignments. "You're assigned to committees where we'd 
get in the least amount of trouble." Bernson was made chairman of the Building 
and Safety Committee, considered something of a yawner. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Bernson stumbled upon some measures that were proposed after the Sylmar 
earthquake in '71, but never enacted. One would require the seismic 
strengthening of all buildings constructed of unreinforced masonry. Engineers 
agreed that these old brick structures were potential death traps in a major 
quake. With seismologists warning that the San Andreas could rupture any time, 
Bernson decided to push for this ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 At City Hall, where some council members do little more than fix potholes or 
posture, and some just seem to posture, this is no small matter. More than 
8,000 buildings in the city of Los Angeles would be affected, very few of which 
were within Bernson's northwest Valley district. Property owners lobbied hard, 
saying the cost of retrofitting their buildings was prohibitive. Some apartment 
owners bused in elderly tenants to testify that their rents would go up and 
they'd be out on the street if such a law was passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson, a conservative who is considered friendly to business and property 
owners, didn't blink. He pushed through the ordinance -- a tribute to 
perseverance. "His seismic safety law is . . . a very serious accomplishment," 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said of Bernson in a 1991 interview. "If he did 
nothing else, he could be proud of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson, who has served on the state Seismic Safety Commission, has championed 
other quake laws and pushed for the creation of annual quake drills. Budget 
cutbacks in recent years have eliminated some of these programs. "But," Bernson 
adds, "the fact is the city was very well-prepared for this. That's why we 
responded so well." 
</P>
<P>
 With quake safety back on the front burner, Bernson now hopes to see these 
quake programs restored. He also hopes for new ordinances that would require 
the reinforcement of wood-frame structures and thus minimize the possibility of 
another deadly disaster like Northridge Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, landlords have warned Bernson's quake committee that new ordinances 
would make it too expensive to do business. Greig Smith, Bernson's chief 
deputy, remembers a once-angry Sherman Oaks landlord. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'If you force me to do some of these things, I'm not going to 
rebuild. It costs too much!' To which Hal said, 'What is the cost of a life?' 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a poignant comment and it just kind of shut him up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Did the retrofitting of unreinforced masonry buildings save lives? 
</P>
<P>
 "What if?" is always a tricky question. Larry Brugger, chief of the earthquake 
safety division in the city's Building and Safety Department, thinks it may 
have. Back in the early '80s, 8,093 buildings were placed in the program. 
Owners decided to demolish rather than retrofit 1,617 of those buildings. 
Another 5,708 were strengthened; of the rest, more than 200 have the work under 
way and another 500 have yet to comply. According to a Bernson aide, the 
retrofitted structures included 1,300 apartment buildings that contained 37,000 
units and may house more than 200,000 people, given the crowded tenements of 
Hollywood and Pico-Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Several masonry buildings, reinforced and not, were damaged in the quake. No 
lives were lost in these structures. 
</P>
<P>
 The story might have been very different if not for the prudent measure that a 
freshman councilman discovered, dusted off and pushed into law. 
</P>
<P>
 Were it not for that, Brugger suggests, then maybe, just maybe, some of those 
old brick buildings would have collapsed like so many chimneys. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; A LESSON IN HOW-TO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The county is considering some controversial proposals for the Tustin Marine 
Corps Air Station after it closes in 1997. And these ideas, which include 
detention facilities and a police training center, are not what the Tustin Base 
Closure Task Force, the local group planning for the base, has in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The process is remarkable nonetheless. The discussion between county and local 
planners is being conducted in a cooperative atmosphere, unlike the 
contentiousness over nearby El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. While there is 
local opposition to what the county hopes for, community leaders have renounced 
the "not-in-my-back-yard" approach. 
</P>
<P>
 In so doing, they are providing a "how-to" model for El Toro, where there are 
many agendas and little consensus so far. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the approach in the Tustin planning is a recognition that a 
cooperative front is needed when presenting plans to Washington for screening. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Board of Supervisors is scheduled to consider asking the U.S. 
Department of Defense to allow detention facilities and a jail for prisoners on 
daytime work furloughs, a second juvenile hall, an alcoholism rehabilitation 
center and a law enforcement training facility.  
</P>
<P>
 Tustin Mayor Jim Potts says, "We're all working on this together." A member of 
the task force says, "Within reason, everything is viable." Already, there 
appears to be room for negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Are the folks quarreling over El Toro paying attention?

JIM MURRAY: IT'S TOUGH TO FIND THE TRICK TO THIS CONFIDENCE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're a golfer, every year at this time, the heart pounds a little faster, 
you hyperventilate a trifle and you get this surge of euphoria. 
</P>
<P>
 The world's best players are coming through this part of the country, and you 
get this little thrill thinking contact with them will finally get you the clue 
that will lock your game into place and enable you to win all the presses the 
guys at Bel-Air can throw at you. 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, these players are always going around shooting 63s and winning all 
these millions of dollars -- so they must have some secret to the game the rest 
of us don't possess. 
</P>
<P>
 You know how Americans are. They're always convinced someone is holding out on 
them. They believe implicitly there's some single secret to success and it's 
transferable or transmittable. If only someone will level with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody from Thomas Edison to Arnold Palmer has told them the secret is 
long, hard work, that the one element of genius is sweat. But, the Yank 
figures, what do they know? 
</P>
<P>
 So, you talk to the pros and it's disappointing. They don't tell you the vees 
are pointing in the wrong direction or that the whole essence to the game is an 
upright swing. 
</P>
<P>
 To a man, they tell you the game is mental. You have to believe in yourself. 
The equipment, the position at address, the swing plane is secondary. First, 
you have to get in the right frame of mind. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not what Americans want to hear. They want simple solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The pros won't give it to them. For instance, a lot of people couldn't wait to 
hear what Craig Stadler would have to say about the fact he went nearly eight 
years without winning and then won twice in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Stadler brushed right by any technical explanations for the turnaround. "I got 
my confidence back," he explained simply. 
</P>
<P>
 Confidence!? You were hoping he would steer you to a new grip or stance -- 
something you could copy. Instead, he steered you to the uncharted territory of 
the mind. 
</P>
<P>
 But golfer after golfer echoed Stadler. Success is not a weight shift, it's a 
mind set. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important club in the bag is confidence. And it's not a brand name. 
You can't turn to the caddie with your hand out for him to give you that stick. 
You don't go into the locker room and say: "Anybody here seen my confidence? I 
had it here a minute ago, but I mislaid it and I'm on the tee in five minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 The whole answer to golf, they tell you, is believing in yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 That's easy for them to say. You know how they are. They step up to the tee, 
and you say, "Watch out for that water on the right!" And they say, "What 
water?" I had a pal once who told me that what Jack Nicklaus does is, "He wills 
the ball into the hole." A few minutes later, he asked me what I had done on 
the hole, and I told him, "I willed it into the water." 
</P>
<P>
 Golf, you have to know, is one of the great confidence-destroyers this side of 
your mother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a heartless old strumpet. Sooner or later, it will make a fool out of 
you, whether you're Bobby Jones at the Royal & Ancient or a weekend hacker at 
Camarillo. No harlot in high heels and net stockings ever made a bigger chump 
out of a guy who wooed her. Golf is the ultimate in unrequited love. A great 
part for Bette Davis. Golf the heartbreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 They tell you to picture the shot coming off textbook perfect. Try as you 
might, though, negative thoughts creep in. Doubts multiply. 
</P>
<P>
 I had a caddie once come up to me on a long par-four at Riviera and try to get 
me to change clubs. "You've got too much club there," he told me. "You'll go 
over the green." "My boy," I told him, "I've never been over a green in my 
life. But I've been short of a green about a hundred thousand times." 
</P>
<P>
 He was upset. "You'll never play the game that way," he grumbled. I suspect 
he's right. 
</P>
<P>
 But we see the water. We know the sand's there. We know we can top it into the 
barranca. Probably will. Golf is an unplayable lie. Trust me. If the pros are 
worried about their confidence, we should be lighting candles. I have seen 
Nicklaus shoot an 83, to give you an idea. And then go out the next day and 
shoot a 65. Ben Hogan made a 12 on a hole in Jacksonville once. And made a 
birdie two on the next hole. 
</P>
<P>
 But we don't do that. We shoot 102 one day -- and 108 the next. Golf is just 
toying with you. She's a world-class trollop. She'll take your money, your 
health, your well-being and leave you standing on a corner with flowers in your 
hand wondering who's kissing her now. Robbing you of confidence is what she 
does best. Ever stop to think, you almost never see a cocky golfer? Nobody does 
sack dances on a green here. Because they know the old gal is just waiting to 
cut you down to size. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why these guys never come into the press tent to tell you that going to 
a new driver or a long-shafted putter or a cross-handed stroke made the 
difference. They know what wins. No fear of failure. 
</P>
<P>
 But they're as scared of this two-timing floozy as you are. They know she'll 
turn on them without a qualm. The minute she sees a self-doubt cross your mind, 
she's gone. 
</P>
<P>
 So, if you come down to the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic this week in the hopes 
of finding the swing change that will make all the difference in your game, 
forget it. Don't expect the pros to give it to you. If you want to be a better 
player, don't go to a pro, go to a church. Never mind Greg Norman. Try that 
other Norman -- Norman Vincent Peale.

KENNEDY LOSES GAMBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Fly or die!" was his motto for the Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, Duncan Kennedy did a little of both Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 While generating a record pace at an estimated 75 m.p.h., the U.S. luger 
crashed in the third heat of the four-heat event won by defending Olympic 
champion Georg Hackl of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm . . . as hell," Kennedy said. "I just crashed in the Olympics. What can I 
say?" 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy lost it coming out of Turn 13 and was disqualified for not finishing. 
Hackl beat Markus Prock of Austria by 13/100ths of a second as they repeated 
their 1-2 finish of the 1992 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Armin Zoggler of Italy was third. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendel Suckow went from ninth to fifth, the best Olympic finish ever for a 
U.S. man. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, fourth after Sunday's two heats, seemed on his way to passing Zoggler 
in the third heat, meaning he would have been third with the final heat to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in the medals, no doubt about it," U.S. luge official Bob Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ron Rossi, executive director of the U.S. Luge Assn.: "I'm disappointed 
for him but proud that he went out there trying to win. His attitude was he 
wasn't going to leave anything on the track. Isn't that what you try to instill 
in every athlete?" 
</P>
<P>
 A cautious Kennedy finished 10th and 14th in his two previous Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 He came to Norway determined to be aggressive, so amid Monday's frustration 
there was a sense of satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "That wasn't me," he said of the 1988 and '92 Games. "That wasn't sliding the 
way I can. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a huge disappointment, but I can accept it because I did my best. My 
attitude was to really attack. I knew there was some risk there, but I wouldn't 
have been happy hanging back and finishing in the teens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, I was going for it. That was my goal, but I apparently crossed the 
line. I brought a little too much pressure out of 13. I carried a little too 
much edge. When the ice is as hard and fast as this, you pay a price." 
</P>
<P>
 How fast was it? 
</P>
<P>
 Hackl, first out, heated up the sub-zero morning by breaking the track record 
he had set Sunday. Prock, sliding next, promptly broke Hackl's record. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy then was only 4/100ths off Prock's pace as he picked up speed on the 
lower part of the course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it would be tough beating Hackl and Prock, but I was confident I could 
finish third, and I wanted that record," he said. "I felt the record would be 
satisfaction in itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's mistake, Rossi said, was a subtle one on uncompromising ice. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in the sweet spot of the curve, but he carried the line a little too 
long," Rossi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of coming out in the middle of the straightaway, Kennedy was cutting 
across the straightaway and tried to compensate by raising his head and 
dropping his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
 He promptly cut back the other way, bouncing first off the right wall, then 
off the left before he began to lose the sled in Turn 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "By that time I was trying to relax and not fight it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's suit was torn, but he was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hard to believe at 75 m.p.h.," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Betsy, was near tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Kennedy had advised her to watch from Turn 13 "because that's 
where the action is." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of a mother's prerogative to be heartbroken," she said. "It kills 
me. I can't tell you how much it hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy said he generally crashes once or twice a season, but he couldn't 
remember when it last happened in a race and not practice. 
</P>
<P>
 What was his initial thought? 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe it," he said. "I thought, 'Oh, no. Not now. This can't be 
happening.' " 
</P>
<P>
 When the disconsolate Kennedy returned to the starter's house at the top of 
the hill, teammate Suckow wasn't sure how to react. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what to say or what's right to say," he said. "I just patted 
him on the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what he did to me when I crashed in Oberhof (Germany, during a World 
Cup race). It's part of racing, but it's hard to accept." 
</P>
<P>
 Suckow said he was generally satisfied with his finish.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's also a disappointment to think about what I might have had," he said. 
"My starts are consistently terrible, and yet I can still slide with these 
guys. It's something I have to continue to work on. I think it's natural to 
wonder what I'd be doing if my starts were better." 
</P>
<P>
 Suckow, 26, said he would take it a year at a time now, unsure if he will 
still be sliding in '98, when the Winter Games are held in Nagano, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, also 26, voiced similar thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The disappointment is going to be there for a while, but life goes on," he 
said. "Hopefully, there'll be other chances. If not, I've had a lot of good 
races and a lot of good years. I can't complain -- only a little bit."

DEATH HITS DAYTONA ONCE AGAIN; AUTO RACING: RODNEY ORR BECOMES SECOND DRIVER IN 
FOUR DAYS TO DIE IN CRASH AT SPEEDWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second time in four days, a Winston Cup stock car driver was killed in 
a single-car accident at Daytona International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Orr, 31, of Panama City, Fla., who had never before attempted to 
qualify for a Winston Cup race, was killed Monday when his family-owned Ford 
Thunderbird hit the wall on the driver's side as it came out of the second turn 
during a morning practice session. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash occurred as many drivers were preparing to leave the track and fly 
to Hueytown, Ala., to attend funeral services later in the day for veteran 
driver Neil Bonnett, who was killed last Friday in a shockingly similar 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Orr appeared to lose control as the car came through Turn 2. The back end came 
around in a typical spin situation, but when the car dropped down on the apron, 
Orr apparently attempted to correct the problem. Instead, the car flipped on 
its side and shot up the embankment into the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial impact came at the top of the windshield area. Observers said Orr 
probably was killed instantly, although he was taken to Halifax Medical Center, 
where he was declared dead at 10:06 a.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances closely paralleled Bonnett's fourth-turn crash Friday and 
another accident Thursday that left ARCA driver Andy Farr hospitalized with a 
broken sternum and a bruised heart. All three accidents involved drivers who 
had either little or no recent experience on the high-banked superspeedway at 
Daytona. 
</P>
<P>
 Orr had never driven a Winston Cup car until last month; Farr had never driven 
at Daytona in any kind of car, and Bonnett, although he had been in 362 Winston 
Cup races, had not raced at Daytona since 1990, when tire compounds and 
aerodynamic equipment were different. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning the NASCAR Goody's Dash Series for four-cylinder stock cars last 
year, Orr was attempting to make a big jump into the eight-cylinder Cup cars, 
by passing the intermediate Busch Grand National class. Goody's Dash cars run 
at about 155 m.p.h., about 35 to 40 miles slower than the Daytona 500 cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Orr and his father bought a new Thunderbird in the off-season and had veteran 
engine builder Ernie Elliott prepare a motor for the car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to go out there and try to look good and run it professional and 
attract a major sponsor," Orr told the Palm Coast News-Tribune on Friday. "I 
would just like to get some experience. I just want to make the (starting) 
field." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was one of only seven drivers to better 190 m.p.h. during 
preseason testing at Daytona, Orr did not attempt to qualify Saturday when 
another rookie, Loy Allen Jr., won the pole with a speed of 190.158 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Orr was preparing to take his qualifying run later Monday when he crashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Orr's Goody's car was sponsored by Bobby Brooks' Exxon station in 
Robbinsville, N.C., where Orr was raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Orr's family moved to Panama City, north of Daytona Beach, two years ago, 
where Orr did most of his racing at Volusia Speedway in nearby Barberville. 
</P>
<P>
 The deaths of Bonnett and Orr were the first in Winston Cup racing since 
August of 1991, when J.D. McDuffie died from injuries in a crash at Watkins 
Glen, N.Y. The last previous stock car racing fatality on the Daytona track was 
that of Joe Booher, in last year's Daytona Dash.

MIKE DOWNEY: 'WHY CAN'T THIS POOR GUY WIN THIS ONE DARN RACE?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He's the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 A winner. A champion. A hell of a human being. Everybody who knows him admires 
him. Adversaries respect him. Year in, year out, he defeats them. He's as good 
as anybody out there. He belongs out there on his sport's biggest day. But does 
he win? At Winter Olympics XIV -- no. Winter Olympics XV -- no. Winter Olympics 
XVI -- no. And now, Winter Olympics XVII -- no. 
</P>
<P>
 People get sentimental about him. Just once, they want him to win. Behind his 
back, some call him a choker. He's the best in the business. The U.S. coach 
calls him the "Carl Lewis of skating." But he hasn't won a gold, hasn't won a 
silver, hasn't won a bronze. The track's either too soft or too hard. He's 
either too distracted or too focused. He slips, he falls, he fails. He's the 
Gerald Ford of skating. 
</P>
<P>
 Man, oh, man. Maybe Dan Jansen is a choker. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a choke. It's not, it's not," Pat Kelly is saying. 
</P>
<P>
 He is shaking his red-haired head. Pat skates for Canada. His dad was Red 
Kelly, the hockey great, the former Detroit Red Wing and Toronto Maple Leaf who 
later served in Parliament. Pat Kelly competed in Monday's 500-meter men's 
speedskating final here. His time was 37.07 seconds. Jansen's was 36.68. Pretty 
close, which is crazy, because Pat is in Dan's race, but he is not in Dan's 
league. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly says: "Your nerves just get going. Everybody has problems now and then. 
Dan Jansen's the best skater in the world, and we all know it." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah. If only he could show it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, yeah," Kelly says. "But I'm sure Dan isn't going to kill himself over 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course not. Dan's smart. Dan's stable. As his coach, Peter Mueller, the man 
who compared him to Carl Lewis, pointed out, Dan Jansen is still the greatest 
sprinter in skating, still a perfect gentleman. As his best friend, skater 
Andrew Gabel, pointed out, Dan Jansen is still married to a lovely woman, still 
father to a lovely daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 He just isn't an Olympic medalist. Again. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Walters, who coaches Kelly and the Canadian team, can't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dan Jansen has been in, what, 300 races? He's been the most consistent skater 
in the world. But he's stayed a nice guy with the same size head. It's almost 
like everyone wants him to win -- even the people racing against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why can't this poor guy win this one darn race?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Ireland, the Canadian who skated alongside Jansen this time, couldn't 
believe it, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't see him slip," he said. "I just saw some chunks flying. I heard some 
major scratching going on, like ice breaking. It sounded like a major slip to 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened? Did he say?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jansen said he wasn't sure what happened. He said the ice was a little hard. 
He said he was skating fine. He said he felt great. He said he slipped around 
Turn 3, which had never given him any trouble before. He said, "That's why I 
can't believe it." He said, "Without the slip, I win." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it just isn't meant to be, he said. Funny, that's what the Buffalo Bills 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jansen follows pro football. He even wore a Carolina Panthers' cap -- it's an 
NFL expansion club -- after Monday's race. And he handled the situation as 
graciously as the Bills did, handled the disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Having had so much practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who I feel sorry for is my family," Jansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not for yourself? 
</P>
<P>
 "No. Maybe later." 
</P>
<P>
 On Valentine's Day, his heart was broken. Make that re-broken. The winning 
time was 36.33 seconds. He doesn't slip, Dan Jansen beats 36.33, easy. One 
slip. One teensy slip. Not a stumble. Not a fall. A slip. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Jansen said, "Four Olympics. I don't get it. What is this?"

GOLDEN SLIPPER STILL DOESN'T FIT JANSEN; SPEEDSKATING: OLYMPIC WOES CONTINUE AS 
HE SKIDS TO EIGHTH IN THE 500 METERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For anyone who has suffered with speedskater Dan Jansen through his sad Winter 
Olympic history, the events of Monday in the Olympic Hall no doubt inspired 
numerous feelings. Disbelief should not have been among them for the only truly 
incredible result would have been a Jansen triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, his wife, Robin, sat among the crowd with their infant daughter long 
after Jansen's fourth and probably last chance to win a medal in the 500 meters 
had literally slipped away and searched for an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I saw him slip, I said, 'Why, God? Why again?' " she said after 
his eighth-place finish. "God can't be that cruel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure some day we'll find out. Someday, we'll understand." 
</P>
<P>
 But for Monday, in an arena designed to look like an overturned Viking ship, 
it was their lives that once more had been turned upside down. 
</P>
<P>
 Were it not for the knowledge that he has been the most star-crossed Olympian 
in recent memory, Jansen, 28, would have been the overwhelming favorite. No one 
else has skated the distance in under 36 seconds, and he has done it four 
times, most recently in lowering the world record to 35.76. 
</P>
<P>
 Seemingly relaxed as he stepped onto the track purported to be the world's 
fastest, a track on which he set a world record in December, he said later that 
he was confident of victory even as he entered the final turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, 150 meters from the finish, his left skate slipped. Panicking because he 
knew that he had lost time, he tried to compensate by pushing himself harder. 
He slipped again, this time touching his left hand to the ice to prevent a 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 His time at the finish was 36.88, slower than nine of his last 10 races, and 
.35 of a second behind Russia's Aleksandr Golubev, who won in an Olympic record 
36.33. Golubev's teammate, Sergei Klevchenya, was second in 36.39, and Japan's 
Manabu Horii was third in 36.53. 
</P>
<P>
 After his race, Jansen put his hands on top of his head in frustration, then 
donned sunglasses and left the arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "No questions, please," he said as he brushed by reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty minutes later, he returned to face the questions, many of which he 
could not answer without having seen a videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," he said when asked what happened on the final turn. "I was 
fine up to that point. That's not a place where you would normally slip. That's 
why I can't believe it. I just can't explain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a great morning. I slept great. I was less nervous than I was for the 
World Championships two weeks ago. I thought I was going to break a record. 
</P>
<P>
 "For as much time as it cost me, I still was only three-tenths of a second off 
a medal. I think I would have won by quite a bit if I hadn't slipped." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he felt sorry for himself, Jansen said, "No, I might later. Right 
now, I don't know what to say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it wasn't meant to be. Everybody knows I'm the best in that race. It 
just didn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Jansen said the ice was harder than it had been during his practices. But some 
skaters said the ice was soft, and others said it was perfect. They all agreed 
that he should have been the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that Jansen is the fastest sprinter on earth, so the eighth place 
he took today just does not fit," Russia's Klevchenya said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Jansen's coach, Peter Mueller, "It just doesn't happen at the Games for 
him. That doesn't take away from what he is, the greatest sprinter of all time 
and a great gentleman. It's just not meant to happen, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Jansen, from the Milwaukee suburb of Greenfield, skated in his first Winter 
Olympics at 18, finishing a surprising fourth in the 500 in Sarajevo in 1984 
and establishing himself as a rising young star. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was still precocious, he was considered among the medal contenders 
four years later in Calgary, Canada. But in the early morning hours on the day 
he was to compete in the 500, he received word that his sister, Jane, had died 
after a lengthy battle with leukemia. He was distraught, but he skated anyway, 
and fell. Four days later, hours before returning home for his sister's 
funeral, he skated in the 1,000 and fell again. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next four years, he was constantly reminded of the tragedy in 
interviews, and, by the time he arrived in Albertville, France, for the 1992 
Winter Olympics, he was filled with anxiety, he admitted later, about whether 
he could put Calgary out of his mind and focus on the task at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 He could not. In the 500 meters, a race in which he figured to finish no worse 
than second, he hesitated entering the final turn, the same turn where he 
slipped here Monday, and finished fourth. In despair, he later finished 26th in 
the 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But he and his coach, Peter Mueller devised a new strategy in the two years 
before these Games. They would not talk about past Olympic disappointments, 
focusing all their energy on succeeding here. 
</P>
<P>
 It is still possible that they will. Jansen is scheduled to compete Friday in 
the 1,000, not a dominating event for him like the 500 but one in which he is 
among the world's fastest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a quitter," Jansen said. "I won't give up. I'll just go out and 
skate. If it happens, it does. If not, I'll go on. Same old thing." 
</P>
<P>
 That is not entirely true. Since the last Winter Olympics, Jansen's wife has 
given birth to a daughter. They named her Jane, after Jansen's late sister. He 
said earlier this year that going home after races to play on the floor with 
her has taught him that life is not just a 500-meter race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life goes on," Robin said upon reflection Monday. "Our life doesn't revolve 
around skating. We'll be fine."

ZERO TO 40 IN FOUR MINUTES FLAT; AGING STEVE SCOTT FINDS HE STILL HAS MILES TO 
GO BEFORE HE RETREATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack Benny would be appalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a guy who can't wait to turn 40. 
</P>
<P>
 But Steve Scott still has a long wait -- he turns 38 in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the rush? He wants to be the first 40-year-old to run a 4-minute mile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every so often, I compute how many months are left," he said between workouts 
for his record 15th appearance in Saturday's Sunkist Invitational at the Sports 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be a great challenge for me -- as important to me as anything I've ever 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 Four-minute (or faster) miles are feats with which Scott has some familiarity. 
He has run 136 of them, believed to be a record. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, sub-fours become a bit more difficult the closer one gets to 40. 
And Scott must first sweat out assaults on the first sub-four for a 40-year-old 
by athletes slightly older. 
</P>
<P>
 "My main competition right now is Eamonn Coghlan of Ireland," Scott said. 
"Eamonn is 41, and had a pretty good run at it last year. He got down to 4:01. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sort of looks to me like Eamonn might not make it, particularly if he 
doesn't get it in this indoor season. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if he doesn't, then the top prospect would be Dave Moorcroft of England, 
who recently turned 40. He ran a 4:02 last summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Once, a four-minute mile was a bad race for Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 His 3:47.69 at Oslo in 1982 is still the fastest mile run by an American. He 
still calls that race, only three-tenths of a second off the world record at 
the time, the high point of his career.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Sunkist, he'll be returning to the scene of his first four-minute mile, 
when he ran 3:59.7 as a 20-year-old in 1977.  
</P>
<P>
 He says the transition from running the mile in his peak years to "senior 
citizen" competition is more mental than physical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't notice any problem with training until I was 34 and 35," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "That was a tough transition for me. I first noticed then that I needed 
extended recovery periods from workouts. Before, I went hard every day. All of 
a sudden, I needed three and four days to recover from a tough workout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mentally, it was tough to accept that. I mean, I wanted to do what I did in 
my 20s. I finally had to understand that while I was as good a miler at 35 as I 
was at 25, I needed different training methods to get the same results. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been at this so many years, I have a great strength base. I've created a 
miler's body, essentially. But I've reached an age where I just have to apply 
more intelligence to my training." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott said he dropped off the list of America's top 10-rated milers last year 
for the first time since the 1970s, but added that he isn't all that far 
removed from his prime.  
</P>
<P>
 "If I have a long time to peak for one race, I'm pretty close to my best," he 
said. "But I can't run great races close together." 
</P>
<P>
 When old milers break down, he said, they do so very quickly. He cited the 
cases of two old rivals, New Zealand's John Walker and Ireland's Coghlan. Both 
are now close friends of Scott's.  
</P>
<P>
 "John came down with an Achilles' (tendon) problem when he was 34, that he 
should have taken care of surgically at the time," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he didn't and he kept trying to run on it. It just got worse. Now, he 
can't even jog. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eamonn tells me he's had a lot of problems with slow-healing injures since he 
turned 38. Now, he says if he gets the slightest calf or hamstring pull, he 
stops and takes care of it immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 If anyone else out there is considering a sub-four mile at 40, or any other 
high-level running performance, Scott has another tip: Get a coach. 
</P>
<P>
 He's presently coached by Irv Ray, cross-country coach at Azusa Pacific.  
</P>
<P>
 Why would a guy who has run 136 four-minute miles need a coach? Is there 
anyone out there who knows more about running the mile than Scott himself? 
</P>
<P>
 "You need someone to bounce ideas off of, more than anything," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "And I need someone to pull in my reins. Ray puts my program together. No 
matter how much you know, you need someone to monitor what you're doing, and to 
tell you when to back off. 
</P>
<P>
 "From 1985 through '87, and from '90 through '92, I didn't have a coach. But I 
should have, in all those years." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, who lives in Leucadia, says he does one quality interval workout a 
week, at UC San Diego or a Del Mar golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 "A typical workout now might be three miles of 200 (yards), each between 30 
and 40 seconds, followed by a two- or three-mile run on grass," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Then I do six repeat 300s, at 43, 45 and 47 seconds. I used to do something 
like that three times a week, then do six- to 10-mile runs in between.  
</P>
<P>
 "I hurt all over the next day now. At 25, it was no problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Finding the exact blend of world-class workouts and rest isn't as easy as it 
sounds.  
</P>
<P>
 "My last three years have been very frustrating," he said. "I just couldn't 
get it right, training versus rest.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a problem with overtraining most of my career, not just now. When 
you're overtrained, you come to a point in a race where your legs suddenly feel 
like tree trunks.  
</P>
<P>
 "You can overtrain for a month and not notice anything. But it comes on very 
quickly and then you need rest. Now, I kind of have it figured out. I'm more 
aware than ever of the importance of rest. I went from my (UC Irvine) days 
through 1988 with no time off at all." Scott grew up in Upland, the son and 
brother of doctors. He and his wife, Kim, have three children -- son Corey, 12; 
daughter Megan, 10, and son Shawn, 1 1/2. Corey, he reports, is a comer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has potential," Scott said. "He's got a very nice stride, but he's had no 
training." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 20 years ago, Scott arrived at UC Irvine as a track prospect of modest 
credentials: He ran a 4:16 mile in high school, and finished second in the half 
mile at the State meet. 
</P>
<P>
 He talks a lot these days of concessions to age in gearing his workouts, of 
being wary of even minor injuries.  
</P>
<P>
 One thing he has had plenty of, however, is the desire to run.  
</P>
<P>
 "Enthusiasm has never been a problem," Scott said. "I still love to run. I 
look forward to my meets now as much as I ever did."

TEMPLE'S CHANEY IS SUSPENDED; BASKETBALL: THE COACH APOLOGIZES FOR THREATENING 
TO KILL MASSACHUSETTS' CALIPARI AFTER GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Chaney, Temple coach, was suspended for one game Monday, a day after he 
publicly threatened to kill Massachusetts Coach John Calipari. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaney apologized for his outburst after the Owls' 56-55 loss to 13th-ranked 
Massachusetts. But Temple President Peter Liacouras suspended Chaney from 
Wednesday night's game at St. Bonaventure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Chaney overstepped the line this time," Liacouras said in a statement. 
"I believe the university must pursue the highest standards in competition, and 
even his sincere apology, he agrees, is insufficient in these circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 The Atlantic 10 Conference said it is investigating the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time Chaney has been disciplined in 12 years during which he 
led the Owls to nine NCAA tournament appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released by Temple's athletic department, Chaney extended his 
apology "to everyone for yesterday's unfortunate incident following the 
basketball game . . . to the Atlantic 10 Conference, the University of 
Massachusetts, the teams, those persons who were present and those who 
witnessed the incident, everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaney planned no further comment, spokesman Gerry Emig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple spokeswoman Harriet Goodheart said Liacouras would not comment beyond 
the statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Chaney's outburst, Calipari was seen berating the referees in the 
hallway after the game and was still complaining vociferously about the 
officiating as he waited his turn at the microphone at a postgame news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaney then charged the podium where Calipari stood. Three Massachusetts 
players moved quickly to intervene, and Chaney was restrained before reaching 
Calipari. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll kill you," Chaney was heard to say. "You remember that." He also said he 
would have his players confront Massachusetts players when the teams play again 
in Philadelphia on Feb. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 When order was restored, Calipari said: "Some things never cease to amaze me. 
And I am going to leave it at that. I am not going to comment any further 
either here or on radio or television." 
</P>
<P>
 Moments before the outburst, a milder Chaney had said: "We made some bad 
decisions at the end. We didn't make the stops we usually make. And some of it 
was due to my own poor judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the first time the successful coaches had tangled. They had to be 
separated in Amherst, Mass., in 1990 after getting into a shoving match at 
midcourt during a triple-overtime game.

THERE IS NO PULLING RANK IN THE RINK; FIGURE SKATING: DESPITE PLEAS FROM U.S. 
OFFICIALS, KERRIGAN AND HARDING WILL HAVE TO PRACTICE TOGETHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Despite pleas by the U.S. Olympic Committee and the U.S. Figure Skating Assn., 
the International Skating Union informed those organizations Monday that the 
decision to place figure skaters Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding in the same 
practice group during the Winter Olympics is irrevocable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remarks have been made that we aren't concerned about Nancy Kerrigan," ISU 
Vice President Lawrence Demmy of Great Britain said. "I think we are doing that 
by keeping things normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always practice as countries. If we change now, we create a massive 
problem. We might have one couple say, 'I'm not skating with this other couple 
because her husband is sleeping with my wife.' We might have one man say he 
doesn't want to be with another because he is gay." 
</P>
<P>
 Expected to arrive here from Portland, Ore., Wednesday afternoon for the 
women's figure skating competition that begins Feb. 23, Harding is scheduled to 
practice twice the next afternoon with a group of five other women, including 
two Czechs, a Bulgarian, a South Korean and Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan's coaches, Evy and Mary Scotvold, have complained that she might be 
distracted by having to share a rink with Harding, who has been implicated by a 
U.S. Figure Skating Assn. hearing panel in the Jan. 6 assault on Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 The concern of the USOC and the USFSA is that the pairing will attract so many 
media that the practices will be disrupted. Already, numerous television crews, 
photographers and reporters who usually cover the women's competition are 
gathering each day at the Olympic Amphitheatre to see Kerrigan. She arrived 
here last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we take (Harding) out of one group and put her in another group, it could 
be considered distracting to the other skaters," Demmy said. "Why should we 
disturb those who have had nothing to do with this?" 
</P>
<P>
 He said the ISU received the latest request from the USOC and the USFSA on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The USFSA's team leader, Gayle Tanger, said the USOC and the USFSA accepted 
the decision, adding that the ISU guaranteed that one of its two technical 
delegates, Demmy or Chuck DeMore of the United States, will attend each of the 
practices involving Harding and Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they see anything disruptive, they will intervene," Tanger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Demmy said he does not expect a problem between the two. "When you think about 
it, Kerrigan will be protected," he said. "Harding will stay as far away as she 
possibly can in practice."

DATELINE / LILLEHAMMER; SKIING OVER SNOW IS NORWEGIAN WAY TO GO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Little League baseball. Age-group swimming. Pop Warner football. Toddler 
gymnastics. Tiny-tot tennis. These are the sports Americans grow up with. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Norway, it's skiing. Cross-country skiing. It's the national pastime 
here. The country's most celebrated sports heroes are cross-country skiers 
Vegard Ulvang and Bjorn Daehlie, triple gold-medalists in the 1992 Winter 
Olympics at Albertville, France. 
</P>
<P>
 In the States, a dedicated but definite minority skis cross-country, and 
mostly recreationally. So, it's small wonder that America's best cross-country 
skier in recent years is a Norwegian. 
</P>
<P>
 John Aalberg, who left here in 1983 to attend the University of Utah, and 
became an American citizen in time for the Albertville Games, is enjoying every 
minute of his return home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great to ski through the Norwegian pines again and to eat the food I 
used to," he said. "I'm very excited to ski for the U.S. and try to beat some 
Norwegians." 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't figure to happen for the U.S. though, because at 33, Aalberg is a 
bit beyond his prime, and because the other Americans have not had the benefit 
of his Norwegian training. 
</P>
<P>
 "Norway is the heart of the sport," Aalberg said. "I started skiing in 
competition when I was 10 or 11. Before that, I was with my friends out on 
skis. Because of all the attention it gets, the best (athletic) talent goes to 
cross-country skiing. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started racing, we had individual age groups and in some of those 
races we'd have almost 200 kids in each class. In the States, if you have 200 
people in all age groups, that's a big race." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for all of this? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the culture and tradition, something Norwegians have done for many years 
and maybe it has something to do with the Birkebeiner story." 
</P>
<P>
 The story of the Birkebeiners -- it means birch leggers, for the birch-bark 
leggings worn by the skiers involved -- dates to 1205, when there was a power 
struggle for the Norwegian throne. The Birkebeiners were entrusted with getting 
the crown prince, 18-month-old Haakon, from Oslo to Trondheim, a long and 
perilous journey on skis. They did, and Haakon grew up, was crowned king in 
1217, united the country and reigned until 1263.

 "Other than that, it's a good way of staying healthy," Aalberg said. "It's 
great exercise. And it's something that's easy to do even when you get older." 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like something Californians could get into. MIKE KUPPER

PICKING UP THE PACE; TOP U.S. SCORING LINE HOPES TO SHOW ITS STUFF AGAINST 
UP-TEMPO SLOVAKIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Todd Marchant is the playmaker, a center who prefers passing to shooting. Left 
wing Craig Johnson is the digger, the dervish who spins into the corner to 
fight for the puck.Right wing Peter Ferraro is so natural a scorer that, 
according to Marchant, "he just shoots and the puck finds ways to go into the 
net for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the three pose the most formidable scoring threat for the U.S. 
Olympic team. But they had only one goal, combined, in Sunday's 
tournament-opening 4-4 tie with France, and will have to be more effective 
tonight against Slovakia for the U.S. team to stay in medal contention.  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the defense-oriented French team, Slovakia plays an up-tempo style. 
That means the Johnson-Marchant-Ferraro line should be in its element; they are 
the three fastest U.S. skaters and were 1-2-4 in scoring in pre-Olympic play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Craig adds the power to our line because he can score goals and he can hit," 
said Ferraro, who scored 30 goals for the U.S. team in 60 pre-Olympic games. 
"Todd adds good speed and I try to be somewhat creative and add scoring punch. 
I think we have very good line chemistry." 
</P>
<P>
 Led by former NHL star Peter Stastny, Slovakia is seeded 12th in its Olympic 
debut, but has players with significant international experience. The same 
teams played a 5-5 tie at the Telehockey Cup tournament in Lillehammer in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you're going to see a different offensive game from our team 
(today)," Marchant said after practice here Monday. "We're really going to try 
to bury our chances, especially on the power play. . . . We can't float it in 
and hope it trickles through. That's what we were doing against France instead 
of taking the puck with initiative." HELENE ELLIOTT

YOU CAN CALL THE DUCKS' HEBERT ANYTHING -- BUT UNHAPPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the last row near the rafters in Anaheim Arena down to the seats on the 
glass at ice level, thousands of voices join together to shout at the Mighty 
Ducks' goaltender in a roaring chorus. 
</P>
<P>
 "G-e-e-e-e-e-k!"  
</P>
<P>
 At least that's the way his name used to sound to Guy Hebert's Little League 
baseball teammates growing up in Troy, N.Y. The boys who knew Hebert from 
hockey put the Lafleur touch on the name of a kid whose mom had named him Guy, 
as in Lombardo. But the boys who played only baseball were baffled. He didn't 
seem like a geek to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Goalies are sometimes seen as the left-handed pitchers of hockey -- 
high-strung, quirky, flaky. But Hebert is from a different mold, an easygoing 
young man who loves to fish, is polite to reporters who think he's 
French-Canadian, and will answer to whatever name you want to call him. Even if 
it's occasionally Bobby, the nickname some college buddies came up with when 
they decided it was easier to borrow the NFL quarterback's name than pick a 
pronunciation of Guy. 
</P>
<P>
 His ability to go with the flow has been valuable during the Ducks' first 
season. He and Ron Tugnutt have shared the starter's job most of the season in 
a rotation even they could never quite predict -- until just recently, when 
Coach Ron Wilson dropped his "Nos. 1 and 1-A" designation and called Hebert his 
"big-game" starter, at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in his NHL career, Hebert is a regular starter. The closest 
he's ever been to that role before was during a two-week stretch last season 
with the St. Louis Blues. He was sitting on the bench as Curtis Joseph's 
understudy when Joseph suffered a minor knee injury. Hebert responded with his 
first career shutout and a four-game winning streak that earned him notice as 
co-NHL player of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like 15 days of glory for me -- I played seven or eight (games) in a 
row," said Hebert, who turned 27 last month. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, he and Tugnutt are playing more than either one ever has. They 
simply haven't known when they would play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tugger and I could never figure out what we had to do to play the next game," 
Hebert said. "We don't even really speak in terms of a No. 1 and No. 2. We're 
both here trying to play the best every night for the team. I feel fortunate 
that I've gotten to play several games now. But nothing's ever taken for 
granted around here. . . . You just take each game as it comes and try to play 
the best you can so they'll be forced to put you back in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they have been the Ducks' answer to Florida's John Vanbiesbrouck. 
It's now clear that the remarkable success of the NHL's two newest teams is 
largely the result of expansion guidelines that allowed existing teams to 
protect only one goaltender, instead of two, from selection in the expansion 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida took a proven veteran, while the Ducks drafted two talented young 
backups. At times this season, Hebert and Tugnutt have both had goals-against 
averages under 3.00 and save percentages above .900. 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt got the team's first victory, over the Edmonton Oilers on Oct. 13, and 
Hebert was in goal for the first road victory, beating the New York Rangers at 
Madison Square Garden on Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert posted the first shutout when he beat Toronto, 1-0, on Dec. 15 at Maple 
Leaf Gardens; Tugnutt answered with a shutout of the New York Islanders at 
Nassau Coliseum on Dec. 28, and Hebert added another for good measure when he 
shut out Vancouver on Feb. 4 at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, they have maintained an easy camaraderie, rooming together on 
the road and dressing next to each other before home games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure Tugger is champing at the bit," Hebert said during a recent stretch 
when he started six consecutive games and 10 of 12. "Things can change 
overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt, who is most remembered for making 70 saves for the Quebec Nordiques 
in a 1991 game against the Boston Bruins only to end up with a 3-3 tie, fell 
out of the Ducks' rotation about the time he stayed home from a two-game trip 
because of the approaching birth of his first child, Jacob Ronald Alfred, on 
Jan. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the baby came, I really had my mind on other things," Tugnutt said. "I 
had a few worries in my life. I stayed home from that trip, Guy came in and 
played very well in those games. . . . My confidence is fine, I'm fine. I'm 
staying ready, so when I get the chance to play, I'll play well." 
</P>
<P>
 At least for now, Hebert is the closest thing the Ducks have had to a No. 1 
goalie all season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think I have more and more confidence going into every game," said 
Hebert, who has a 2.80 goals-against average and a 12-17-3 record. "If things 
are going well, each game kind of carries over into the next. You don't have 
time to think. Once you start thinking, you think, 'Oh, I had a bad game, I'll 
have to sit out this one and wait for the next game to come.' It's good that 
the coaches have confidence in me, and if you have maybe an off period, they 
leave you in and let you work through it. It's a great position to be in right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a position Hebert didn't realize he was in until Wilson told reporters 
that Hebert would start the big games. 
</P>
<P>
 It was no problem for Hebert, who said: 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaches go about their business. I guess his way of saying he has 
confidence in me is by starting me right now. For me, that's good enough. He 
doesn't have to come and pat me on the back or anything. When he comes in and 
says, 'You're going tonight,' that's a good enough vote of confidence right 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just feel very fortunate to be playing pro hockey for a living. I couldn't 
have a better job in the world right now. For me, to get a chance to play 40-50 
games this (season) is just a great thrill. I'm sure Tugger's happy playing 
more often than he did last year." 
</P>
<P>
 As for any fatigue from the extra workload, Hebert said: "I'm sure there's 
some fatigue, but I've been waiting for the chance to do this for quite a few 
years. And you've got to take the bull by the horns when you get a chance 
because you might never get a chance again." 
</P>
<P>
 When Hebert told his older brother, Paul, about the crowd at Anaheim Arena, 
they could only laugh and say in agreement: "Wait until Mom and Dad hear that 
."

FORMER KING LOACH FINALLY IMPRESSES THE DUCKS ENOUGH TO GET CALLED UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lonnie Loach, who was taken from the Kings by the Mighty Ducks in the 
expansion draft last June but has spent the entire season in the minor leagues, 
was called up by the Ducks Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Loach, 25, scored 10 goals in 50 games with the Kings last season but didn't 
make the Ducks' squad at the end of training camp.He was assigned to San Diego 
of the International League. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, even his prolific minor league scoring pace -- 32 goals and 36 
assists in 55 games -- had been unable to earn him a spot with the Ducks, but 
General Manager Jack Ferreira saw him score four goals against a visiting 
Central Red Army team Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He played very, very well," Ferreira said. "I was just thinking about it and 
debating it and I just decided he deserves a shot. . . . He scored four goals 
and they were really good goals. They weren't just tap-ins, they were 
sniper-type goals." ROBYN NORWOOD

DIVISION III; PACIFICA PLAYERS MAKE REACHING GOALS A HABIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach Bob Becker's run-and-stun Pacifica Mariners attained their first goal -- 
the playoffs -- nearly a month ago. Their second goal -- a Garden Grove League 
title -- has been clinched for a couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But their third goal, a Southern Section Division III-A championship, might 
not come quiet so easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Mariners finished the season 23-1 and 14-0 in league, they were 
seeded behind North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake (22-2) and La Canada (19-2) in 
the III-A tournament draw. 
</P>
<P>
 But Becker didn't seem concerned about his seeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to (complain) about any playoff brackets; you have to play 
everybody anyway," he said. "There are seven teams that can win the III-A." 
</P>
<P>
 And Becker said his team is ready for anybody, including Estancia (15-10), the 
No. 3 team from the Pacific Coast League, whom they play in Friday night's 
opening round. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our whole season is based on getting prepared for playoffs," he said. "We 
aren't going to be affected by fouls. Before the first quarter is over, we've 
already played 12 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen a lot of different looks and we've been able to adjust to every 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 But La Quinta Coach Jim Perry, whose team was beaten twice by Pacifica, said 
there is simply no way to prepare for some of the more hostile environments 
encountered on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have to travel to Yucca Valley or Temescal Canyon, you can get cooked 
in a hurry," Perry said. "You put yourself in a bus for four hours, you better 
be strapped up and ready to go. I don't know if they're ready to go to Lompoc, 
where the whole town shuts down and they just dare you to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, Perry said there won't be many teams that are able to deal with 
Pacifica's depth. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have 10 guys that could start for us," he said. "I mean, how much more 
does the deck have to get stacked?" 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said he sees a team like top-seeded Harvard-Westlake, which has 6-foot-8 
twins Jason Collins and Jarron Collins giving Pacifica the most problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything hurts Pacifica, it's their inside game," he said. "We felt we 
could compete with Pacifica as long as (Jon) Surface and (Chris) Vlasic play 
outside. We were tied with them until Surface decided he wanted to go down low 
the last three minutes. Against the kind of people they're going to play, 
they're going to have to be more imaginative offensively." 
</P>
<P>
 Becker agreed that solid post play will be a key for his team. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the playoffs, the best defensive teams run off the floor," Becker said. 
"We're going to have to do a good job of defending the post. There's more good 
players in the post than out of the post in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta (15-10, 9-5 in the Garden Grove League) isn't blessed with the size 
or depth of Pacifica, but Perry said he's not ready to concede anything to any 
team in the III-AA playoffs. The Aztecs play Friday at Santa Margarita (20-6), 
the Sea View League's No. 1 team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sat down with these kids before the season and set some goals," he said. 
"The kids have hit them right on the head. They've come from just getting 
hammered night in and night out to be a very respectable team. Anybody that 
takes us for granted is taking a chance. We're not the most talented team, but 
we have kids with great heart. Collectively, they believe they have a lot to 
prove to themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Becker also gives Bolsa Grande (14-10, 10-4), which finished second in the 
Garden Grove, a shot at pulling an upset or two in the III-AA playoffs. The 
Matadors open Friday by playing host to Servite (17-8), the No. 3 team from the 
Sunset League. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really believe that Tom Cardoza and (Ron) Inman should be coach of the 
year," Becker said. "If I were a league champion, I sure wouldn't want to play 
Bolsa." Division III-AA at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion: Inglewood Morningside. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded teams: Sonora (22-5), Lake Arrowhead Rim of the World (21-3), Santa 
Margarita (20-6), Magnolia (18-7). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark horse: Bolsa Grande (14-10). A team with no one over 6 feet 2 that nobody 
wants to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Top players: Travis Bates (Moreno Valley Rancho Verde), Brian Baughman (Bolsa 
Grande), Ken Cauley (La Habra), Craig Clark (Sonora), Chris Dee (Foothill), 
David Downs (Servite), Davon Dural (Compton Centennial), Brad Finneran (Santa 
Margarita), Chad Fister (Sonora), Frank Henderson (Magnolia), Sergio Hernandez 
(Sonora), Greg Greenfield (La Quinta), Brandon Hearvey (Magnolia), Andrija 
Kristich (La Habra), Sean Morris (Foothill), Dante Marks (Pomona), Kareem 
Mutrie (Torrance Bishop Montgomery), Tuan Pham (Bolsa Grande), Jayson Sanders 
(Bishop Montgomery), Keith Sanders (Murrieta Valley), Mark Seaton (Servite), 
Todd Snyder (La Quinta), Paul Tayyar (Newport Harbor), Todd Wilson (Savanna), 
Kevin Ward (Murrieta Valley). 
</P>
<P>
 Best draw: Rim of the World (21-3). The second-place team in the Sunkist 
Leagueis second-seeded and has a fairly easy route to semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst draw: After beating Fullerton to reach the playoffs, La Habra (17-10) 
must travel to Pomona (17-10). If it wins, it could get third-seeded Santa 
Margarita in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: The key to Santa Margarita's hopes might depend on whether forward 
Brian Finneran can come back from his broken foot. Without Brian Finneran, 
opponents can key on his twin, Brad Finneran. Division III-A at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion: Sherman Oaks Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded teams: North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake (22-2), La Canada (19-2), 
Pacifica (23-1), San Dimas (21-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark horse: La Canada Flintridge St. Francis (19-6). Led by 6-11 center Chris 
Ott and 6-8 forward Braden Weber, the Golden Knights finished second in the Del 
Rey League to Bellflower St. John Bosco, the fifth-ranked team in Division II. 
</P>
<P>
 Top players: Ramon Alliman (Pacifica), Chris Beerman (Cathedral City), Jamar 
Bailey (San Dimas), Jamal Childs (Covina), Jason Collins (Harvard-Westlake), 
Jarron Collins (Harvard-Westlake), Manuel Escamilla (Santa Paula), Billy Fields 
(Bellflower), Clay Franz (Estancia), Scott Garson (Harvard-Westlake), Mark 
Gozun (Covina), Michah Hanson (Moorpark), Chris Moreland (Duarte), Chris Ott 
(La Canada St. Francis), Pete Paciorek (San Marino), Cliff Parker (Lompoc), 
Charlie Petit (La Canada), Jecarl Riggins (Pasadena Blair), Eric Sanchez (La 
Canada), Jon Surface (Pacifica), Jeremy Veal (San Dimas), Chris Vlasic 
(Pacifica), Brandon Weber (St. Francis), Yaphet Wiltz (Bellflower). 
</P>
<P>
 Best draw: La Canada (19-2). The Spartans lost one more game than Pacifica, 
but they were seeded higher and a much easier first-round matchup than the 
Mariners, who must play Estancia (15-10). 
</P>
<P>
 Worst draw: San Dimas (21-4). The Saints lost only four games, one to 
second-seeded La Canada and another to Glendora, the fourth-seeded team in 
II-AA, but could meet talented St. Francis in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Veal, a 6-3 senior guard, has already signed a letter of intent with 
Arizona State. He is averaging 30 points, eight rebounds, four assists and is 
shooting 55% from three-point range. "He's legitimate," Pacifica Coach Bob 
Becker said. "I saw him on film and he made this flying dunk on the baseline 
over a couple people. Our guys can dunk but they can't dunk with people in 
their face."

DIVISION II; VALENCIA COACH, PLAYERS HAPPY TO BE COMPETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Southern Section Division II boys' basketball playoffs begin Friday, 
there will be some stark contrasts in the opening round for Orange County 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 First-year Coach Dean Yoshimura and Orange League champion Valencia will play 
host to a Division II-A first-round game Friday against Katella. Yoshimura's 
counterpart is Coach Tom Danley, who has won 513 games during his 27-year 
career and seen many playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing has been real exciting for us," Yoshimura said. "This school 
has only won three league championships in 60 years. It's a big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Unseeded Valencia (14-10) tied Magnolia (18-7) for the league championship 
with a victory Friday over the Sentinels. Magnolia is the fourth-seeded team in 
Division III-AA. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valencia-Katella winner will play the Tustin-Los Amigos winner in the 
second round, Feb. 22, so at least one county team will make the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin (19-7), the fourth-seeded team that tied Santa Margarita for the Sea 
View League championship, plays host to Los Amigos (11-14) Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tillers are led by Coach Andy Ground, who was an assistant coach when the 
Tillers won a Southern Section and State championship in 1991, and junior Doug 
Gottlieb, one of the best point guards in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, Don Grable helped Los Amigos reach the Southern Section semifinals; 
now he is in his first year as the Lobos' coach. This year, the Lobos finished 
fourth in the Garden Grove League after a 7-16 record last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy won the Freeway League championship for the first time since 1986, but 
the Warriors have a tough draw. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first round, the Warriors will play host La Mirada, a team that 
defeated Troy this season, 79-54. If Troy advances, second-seeded Bellflower 
St. John Bosco and 6-foot-6 point guard Jelani Gardner, one of the top players 
in the state, loom in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Division II-AA, four of the five Orange County teams are grouped in a 
bracket with second-seeded Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, Trabuco Hills plays host to Woodbridge and Huntington Beach plays host 
to Loara in the lower half of the draw. The two winners meet in the second 
round, Feb. 22, and the second-round winner qualifies for the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View is in the top half of the draw and travels to El Monte Mountain 
View for the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're glad we don't have to play Mater Dei," Huntington Beach Coach Roy 
Miller said. "We played them enough last season." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers, who finished second in the Sunset League, dropped from Division 
I-A where they lost to the Monarchs last season in the Southern Section 
regional playoffs.

DIVISION I; TOUGH BREAKS HAVEN'T BROKEN FOUNTAIN VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If ever there was a recipe for disaster, this was it. Nothing, and that means 
nothing, seemed to go in Fountain Valley's favor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons lost player after player. Heck, they didn't even have a gymnasium 
to call their own until January. So how did this team, with so much going 
against it, end up as Sunset League champions? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, it surprised me, too," Coach Gordon Billingsley said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, through hell and high water, Fountain Valley won. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons (20-5) finished above .500 for the first time since 1989. They were 
12-2 in the Sunset League, winning their first league title since 1985. 
Fountain Valley even finished in style, winning its last 10 games and will play 
host to Long Beach Millikan tonight in the first round of the Southern Section 
I-AA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite a list of accomplishments for a team that has only seven of its original 
11 players left. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a little luck," Billingsley said. "But we've made our own luck once 
in a while. I just have a bunch of overachievers. They battle." 
</P>
<P>
 They've had to. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the season began, the Barons were faced with adversity. Vandals 
trashed the Fountain Valley gymnasium, causing nearly $200,000 in damage. 
Repairs were not completed until early January. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons were forced to practice at a church, which had only two baskets. 
They didn't play a home game until Jan. 5, against Westminster in the league 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
 And still they won. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley won the Arroyo Grande tournament and were consolation 
champions of the Orange tournament. The Barons also reached the consolation 
final of the Cerritos-Gahr tournament where they lost in overtime to Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons have won all eight of their home games since the gym reopened. A 
fact not lost on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, the kids keep telling me it has to be the new floor," Billingsley said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Barons had other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 As the season went on, their absentee list grew. They lost Mike Arvesen and 
Matt Byrd before the first game. Arvesen, who was coming off knee surgery, was 
discovered to have a heart arrhythmia. Byrd was lost because of grades. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been joined on the sideline by Javiar Scalini and David Arvesen. 
Scalini broke an ankle and Arvesen was told not to play by his dentist after 
having a tooth pushed in by an elbow against Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we had a pretty solid team coming into the season," Billingsley 
said. "But at one point, I just thought it wasn't meant to be." 
</P>
<P>
 And still they won. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley was 2-2 in league play, having lost to Huntington Beach 
(53-33) and Servite (62-38). Then the Barons got rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of their victories have been by six points or less, including one-point 
victories over Huntington Beach and Servite. 
</P>
<P>
 Billingsley said the key moment in league play came during the second 
Huntington Beach game when the teams were tied for first. The Oilers jumped out 
to a 20-6 lead and appeared to be well on their way to their second title. Then 
Fountain Valley went on 17-0 run in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Arvesen, who had been knocked out of the game with an elbow to the tooth, came 
back and hit a three-pointer to give Fountain Valley a 57-56 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any superstars and I think that's why we always end up winning 
close games," Billingsley said. "Our kids don't care about flash. They just 
care about the ball going in the hoop." 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon Leimbach and Phil Domingo -- the only two Barons taller than 6 feet 2 
-- are the team's leading scorers. Leimbach, a 6-3 forward, averages 18 points 
and Domingo, a 6-5 center, averages 15. 
</P>
<P>
 But Billingsley credits point guard Danny Hoppie with much of the team's 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 "He dictates what we do," Billingsley said. 
</P>
<P>
 And what they do is win. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Billingsley: "The mental makeup of this team is that they think they can 
play with anybody." Division I-A at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion: Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded teams: Mater Dei (26-0), Newhall Hart (21-1), Orange (20-3), Loyola 
(19-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark horse: Warren (20-6). 
</P>
<P>
 Top players: William Antonio (Arroyo Grande), Ryan Bailey (Los Angeles 
Loyola), Toby Bailey (Los Angeles Loyola), Dinari Bates (Capistrano Valley), 
Jeff Bone (El Toro), O'Real Cotton (Walnut), Schea Cotton (Mater Dei), Gil 
Gonzales (Orange), Thomas Harmon (Century), Jason Hartman (Thousand Oaks). 
</P>
<P>
 Best draw: Mater Dei. Hey, is there anyone out there who can give the Monarchs 
a game? 
</P>
<P>
 Worst draw: Orange. The Panthers are seeded third, but could face Corona 
(20-4), a solid league champion, in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: This would be a wide-open division without Mater Dei, which seems 
destined to win its third-consecutive I-A title. The Monarchs are ranked second 
in the nation by USA Today. Division I-AA at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion: Long Beach Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded teams: Fontana (25-1), Los Alamitos (21-4), Long Beach Poly (20-6), 
Santa Ana Valley (23-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark horse: Lynwood (17-8). 
</P>
<P>
 Top players: Darnell Adamson (Santa Ana Valley), Joe Austin (Lynwood), Michael 
Batiste (Long Beach Wilson), Corey Benjamin (Fontana), James Brown (Long Beach 
Poly), Zerrick Campbell (Long Beach Poly), Travon Carmichael (Fontana), Alvin 
Counts (Ontario), Pharoah Davis (Palmdale Highland), Don Escobar (Bell 
Gardens), Chris Funderburk (Lynwood), Danny Hoppie (Fountain Valley), Brock 
Jacobsen (La Crescenta Crescenta Valley). 
</P>
<P>
 Best draw: Long Beach Poly. Fountain Valley (20-5), which is beat up, is the 
only league champion in its path to the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst draw: Los Alamitos. Several good teams -- Bell Gardens, Simi Valley, 
Canyon Country Canyon, Long Beach Wilson -- are between the Griffins and the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Lynwood finished third in the San Gabriel Valley League, but the 
Knights (17-8) are no ordinary No. 3. They finished behind Compton Dominguez, 
which is seeded No. 1 in II-A, and Warren, one of the top teams in I-A. Lynwood 
might have finished higher had it not lost Funderburk, who missed several games 
with a wrist injury. He returned last week.

DIVISION IV; REAMS TAKE WHITTIER CHRISTIAN TO THE PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE COIL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before this season, Whittier Christian hadn't won an Olympic League title 
since 1988. But before this season, the Heralds never had Trevor and Tyler Ream 
in the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers, who play different styles of basketball, helped the Heralds 
knock off two-time defending league champion Brethren Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler is a small forward with exceptional ability; Trevor is more at home with 
his back to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler is a senior forward and leads Whittier Christian in scoring (14.5 points 
per game), rebounding (6.9) and free-throw percentage (78.1). According to 
Coach Bob Brown, he is "a gifted athlete with great leaping ability who can run 
the floor and play 32 minutes a game." 
</P>
<P>
 Trevor, a junior center, averages 6.1 points and 4.7 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is not the natural athlete that Tyler is," Brown said. "But he works 
exceptionally hard on the finer points of the game. He spends a lot of time 
working on post moves." 
</P>
<P>
 Their styles differ, but they share the same goals: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Win two of three nonleague tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Finish the season with at least a 20-4 record. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Win the Olympic League championship. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Become the second team in school history to win a Southern Section 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heralds won the championship games of the Cerritos Valley Christian and 
Atascadero tournaments, then went on to post a 21-3 record in winning the 
league title. 
</P>
<P>
 That last goal, however, may be a little much to hope for. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier Christian opens the playoffs Friday playing host to the winner of 
tonight's wild-card game between Pasadena La Salle (10-13) and Downey Pius X 
(10-12). If the Heralds win, they will likely face second-seeded Santa Clara 
(15-7) on Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara, the Frontier League champion and winner of 12 Southern Section 
championships -- including four in the past five years -- knocked Whittier 
Christian out of the playoffs in the quarterfinals in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Heralds get past Santa Clara, they would still have to battle a field 
of teams loaded with strong players. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the standouts include, 6-foot-6 Rick Price from Gardena Serra, who has 
signed with Duke; Andre Miller, a Los Angeles Verbum Dei guard who averages 
22.8 points and is being recruited by Arizona, and Troy Collins, a 6-7 junior 
from Pius X who is being recruited by UCLA and others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we have a tough division." Tyler Ream said. "I have played with guys 
from Serra and Verbum Dei. . . . A lot of people still do not believe we 
(Whittier Christian) are for real, and that is an advantage to us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brethren Christian, last year's section Division V-AA champion, has moved up a 
division. After finishing third in the Olympic League, the Warriors (16-8) will 
travel to Santa Monica St. Monica (11-12), the runner-up in the Camino Real 
League, in a Division IV-A wild-card game tonight. The winner will play at 
North Hills L.A. Baptist (15-6), the second-place team from the Alpha League, 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel (13-13), the fourth-place team from the Olympic League, will 
also play a Division IV-A wild-card game tonight when it travels to Sierra 
Madre Maranatha (17-5). The winner will meet second-seeded Santa Clara Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar, the defending section Division IV-AA champion, received an 
at-large berth. The Sea Kings (13-13) finished fifth in the Sea View League but 
still play at home tonight against El Segundo (10-15). The winner will travel 
to third-seeded Twentynine Palms (14-7) Friday. Division IV-AA at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion: Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded teams: Hemet West Valley (19-6), Banning (17-6), Twentynine Palms 
(14-7), Los Angeles Murphy (8-13). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark horse: Corona del Mar (13-13). 
</P>
<P>
 Top players: Ramin Bastani (Corona del Mar), Robert Carrillo (Los Angeles 
Murphy), Jack Hartman (Twentynine Palms), Jason Mora (Santa Ynez), Steve Newton 
(Banning), Matt Sabosky (El Segundo), Roferrel Simpson (Hemet West Valley). 
</P>
<P>
 Best draw: Banning. The second-seeded team gets a bye into the quarterfinals 
and does not have another first-place team in its side of the bracket. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst draw: Los Angeles Murphy. Murphy (8-13) was seeded fourth but must face 
Playa del Rey St. Bernard (12-11), runner-up in last year's championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Corona del Mar finished the season with a 13-13 record, almost 
identical to the 13-12 record it brought into the playoffs last year when the 
Sea Kings won the title. Nine of the 13 teams in the playoffs are the same as 
last year's. Last season's runner-up, St. Bernard, is in the bracket opposite 
Corona del Mar, so a rematch is possible. Division IV-A at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion: Gardena Serra. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded teams: Los Angeles Verbum Dei (20-2), Oxnard Santa Clara (15-7), 
Gardena Serra (15-9), Agoura Oak Park (21-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark horse: Whittier Christian (21-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Top players: Leonard Butler (Serra), Jamal Cobbs (Verbum Dei), Troy Collins 
(Downey Pius X), Reggie Davis (Brethren Christian), Allen Fletcher (Pius X), 
Chris Kuzminski (Mojave), Isaac Leasau (Calvary Chapel), Andre Miller (Verbum 
Dei), Rick Price (Serra), Trevor Ream (Whittier Christian), Tyler Ream 
(Whittier Christian). 
</P>
<P>
 Best draw: Verbum Dei. The top-seeded team meets Kern Valley (9-10), a 
third-place finisher from the High Desert League in the first round. The only 
teams capable of playing with Verbum Dei are Serra, Whittier Christian and 
Santa Clara, and they are on the opposite side of the bracket. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst draw: Calvary Chapel. The Eagles must travel to Sierra Madre Maranatha 
(17-5) for a wild-card game. If they win, the Eagles will be boarding a bus and 
heading to Oxnard to face second-seeded Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Santa Clara has won four of the past five championships. Verbum Dei has 
appeared in the championship game three of the last four years, losing all 
three. Serra has played in the championship the past two years, losing one and 
winning one. Whittier Christian won its only section title in 1989.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; LOVE DRAWS CONNOLLY TO ASSISTANT COACH'S 
POSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A day late, maybe, but here's a Valentine's Day story: 
</P>
<P>
 Merja Connolly has her volleyball jersey retired at UCLA, plays some pro 
volleyball in Italy for a few years and then gets the job as women's coach at 
Cornell. The Big Red made the National Invitational Volleyball Championship 
Tournament -- volleyball's version of the NIT -- in 1992, her rookie year, and 
the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history last season. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman on the move, sure, but whatever happened to upwardly mobile? Connolly 
is leaving Cornell . . . to become an assistant at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's love got to do with it? 
</P>
<P>
 Connolly grew up in Southern California and she's excited about returning 
home. But she's really looking forward to returning to the arms of her fiance, 
Corona del Mar attorney Scott Hanssler. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't imagine I'd love coaching this much and I couldn't imagine I'd 
come to love a university this much, but life is too short to feel emptiness," 
Connolly said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scott and I have fallen madly in love and I'm not the type of person who 
needs security so much that they're afraid to let go of a good thing. It just 
came down to what's more important?" 
</P>
<P>
 Cornell's loss figures to be Irvine's gain. Connolly's ability as a player and 
coach and her famous lineage ought to open a few recruiting doors. Her father, 
Harold (Hal) Connolly, was a gold medalist in the hammer throw during the 1956 
Olympics and her mother, Olga Fikotova, won a gold medal for Czechoslovakia in 
the discus the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 Olga Connolly went on to compete in four more Olympics for the United States 
and was the U.S. flag bearer in Munich in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Merje (the name is Finnish; she was born in Finland) was captain of the 
Bruins' 1984 national championship team and captain of the 1985 U.S. World 
University Games team. Her chance at making the 1988 Olympic team ended with a 
heel injury, but she returned to Italy and played two more years. 
</P>
<P>
 She says those "bloodlines" have helped her as both a player and a coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both of my parents, and my father's new wife, are coaches and I think I 
learned some very important aspects of coaching from them," she said. "I think 
it's a coach's job to clear the path so an athlete has to worry only about 
performing. That goes beyond preparing them physically and mentally to making 
sure every detail is taken care of. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also think I've learned by growing up around athletes that you have to deal 
with them as individuals. We all stress the team aspect, of course, but 
different people have different needs and respond to different motivations." 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Red responded to Connolly with a 36-21 overall record and two 
consecutive Ivy League championships. But she isn't looking back, now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm compromising freedom, yes, and salary," she said, laughing, "but I'm also 
going to work in a conference with the best athletes and the best coaches in 
the nation. Mike (Puritz, Irvine head coach) and I have known each other since 
he recruited me out of Culver City High. I'll have no problem being his 
assistant and I'm looking forward to a new challenge and a new learning 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Viva la difference: Asked the difference between the Anteaters who lost seven 
in a row and the Anteaters who routed Nevada Reno, 99-70, Saturday, Coach Rod 
Baker said, "guys were just challenged." 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't do one thing differently from a technical standpoint," he said. "We 
didn't put in one new thing." 
</P>
<P>
 If it was strictly a matter of effort, why didn't he challenge the guys 
earlier? 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I didn't ask for it in the right way," he said, "Better yet, I didn't 
demand it in the right way." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker held a team meeting Friday, during which he evaluated each player 
individually. He also reviewed his own performance and was more intense, more 
animated and more emotional Saturday than he has been all season. The Anteaters 
seemed to follow Baker's lead, diving for loose balls and rebounding with 
reckless abandon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody needed to take it up a notch, including me," Baker said. "I needed 
to take it up a notch, too. We all had to go like it really meant something." 
</P>
<P>
 Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Is there any such thing as a bad time for momentum? Saturday, Irvine turned in 
its finest all-around performance since a Dec. 29 upset of Iowa, but now the 
Anteaters depart on a two-game trip to Las Cruces, N.M., and Las Vegas. New 
Mexico State and Nevada Las Vegas are a combined 21-2 at home this season . . . 
Former Irvine All-American water polo player Chris Duplanty, after posing with 
Sports Illustrated models for the annual swimsuit issue: "It's the real thing. 
This isn't done by funny-shaped lenses. These women are absolutely stunning. I 
couldn't sleep for a week."

 Anyone who has been to a Saddleback men's basketball game the last two seasons 
knows who Tom McCluskey is.

 Spectators might not know McCluskey by name but his appearance and methods 
make a lasting impression.

 McCluskey, in his second year as an assistant to Coach Bill Brummel, is a 
6-foot-7 blade with a determined and raspy voice, constantly dashing about, 
offering encouragement and criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
 "He brings a tremendous amount of enthusiasm and vitality to our program," 
Brummel said. "His enthusiasm is contagious to the players." 
</P>
<P>
 Brummel and McCluskey met when McCluskey came to Saddleback as a player from 
Redlands High School in 1979. Brummel was an assistant during McCluskey's first 
year and took over as coach for Bill Mulligan the second season. 
</P>
<P>
 McCluskey earned a scholarship to Penn State but suffered a career-ending knee 
injury seven games into his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was as down as a human can be because basketball was too much a part of my 
life," McCluskey said about the knee injury. "Now, I've learned you have to 
have a balance." 
</P>
<P>
 After the injury, McCluskey said he was so depressed he stayed away from 
basketball for most of the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 But a coaching friend persuaded him to sit on the bench at a Fontana High 
School junior varsity game. Suddenly, McCluskey knew what he wanted to do with 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
 His first coaching job was as the varsity coach at Fontana in 1984. He 
remained there for three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved to Tustin for the next five seasons. His teams had a 109-40 record 
and won a Southern Section and a State title. 
</P>
<P>
 But McCluskey, 32, wanted to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every coach internally has that drive to see if they can produce on the next 
level," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1991-1992 season, Brummel was looking for a walk-on assistant and 
McCluskey was ready to move up. 
</P>
<P>
 The two had kept in contact since McCluskey's playing days. Brummel had seen 
McCluskey coach in games and practices and was impressed. McCluskey, not 
coincidentally, has been at Saddleback for its most successful times in the 
last 10 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gauchos won the Orange Empire Conference title last season and are tied 
for first with two games left this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Although McCluskey makes himself known during games, Brummel said his biggest 
contributions come at practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "He makes a tremendous contribution every day that people don't see," Brummel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCluskey also said that coaching in practice is what he enjoys most about 
working on the community college level. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a really positive teaching level," he said. "If you love the game, it's 
a great level because you get to recruit then really work with your own team." 
</P>
<P>
 McCluskey would love to be a community college head coach, but he knows such 
jobs are hard to get. People tend to keep them for a long time. For instance, 
Cypress' Don Johnson is retiring this spring after 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could have an unlimited career," Brummel said of McCluskey. "He could 
coach on this level, Division I or in the pros." 
</P>

 Pizza boy: Jeff Greenfield, the 12-year old son of Golden West men's 
basketball Coach Jim Greenfield, came up the big winner in a halftime 
free-throw shooting contest Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 At halftime of Saddleback's game with visiting Golden West, four tickets were 
drawn and the winners shot for a large pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff, despite a cast on his ankle, limped to the line and, after a miss, made 
two in a row to take home a large pizza. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Record pace: LeAnn Kazmer needs 14 rebounds to set the Orange Coast 
single-season mark. Kazmer, a forward from Wisconsin, has 283 rebounds in 27 
games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Erika Manning had 296 rebounds for the OCC in the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazmer leads the Orange Empire Conference in scoring (20.2 points a game) and 
rebounding (10.5). 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress' Yolanda Hearvey, a sophomore forward, is closing in on the Chargers' 
career-rebounding mark. She has 544 and needs 14 to pass Joyce Rice (1979-81), 
who had 557. 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Roche, a guard on the Orange Coast men's team, set the college's 
single-season record for three-pointers with 75. Roche passed Chuck McGavran 
who had 74 in the 1986-87 season.

BOYS' SOCCER; NO. 4 MARINA WON'T HAVE IT EASY

<P>
 Marina Coach David McLeish wasn't quite sure how to react to his team's being 
seeded fourth in the Division I boys' soccer pairings that were released 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not bad for a second-place team (from the Sunset League)," McLeish 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, Marina must play Fontana (15-5-2), which finished second in the 
Citrus Belt League. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be tough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McLeish sounded envious of second-seeded Santa Ana's draw. The Saints play 
Manhattan Beach Mira Costa (10-9), which finished second in the Ocean League. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have rather drawn someone from that area," he said. "But we've never 
gotten very lucky in the draw. Two years ago, we had a good team and drew 
Damien. We wound up losing in overtime." 
</P>
<P>
 Edison (17-5-1), the third-place team from the Sunset, must play Redondo Union 
Wednesday in a wild-card game and then would travel to top-seeded Simi Valley 
Royal (21-3-3) in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Orange County teams that were seeded: Mater Dei (19-2-4), third in 
Division II; Brea-Olinda (15-4-3), fourth in Division III; and Corona del Mar 
(19-2-4), fourth in Division IV. DAVE McKIBBEN

GIRLS' BASKETBALL; NO SHOCKS: WOODBRIDGE, BREA-OLINDA TOP SEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County teams made it through the playoff selection process unscathed 
Monday. In other words, there were no surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda and Woodbridge, both 25-0, were the No. 1-seeded teams in their 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress was a No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei, Rancho Alamitos and Costa Mesa, No. 3s. 
</P>
<P>
 There were unseeded teams that were happy and seeded teams that were content. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no problems, except for the really picky. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite modified playoff bracketing to reduce travel because of earthquake 
damage, discontent was minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda, gunning for its fourth-consecutive State title, opens with 
Fullerton (16-7) in Division III-AA, where you have to read between the lines 
to find the true seeded teams. Brea will probably face Torrance Bishop 
Montgomery, second-place in the Mission League, in the semifinals; Bishop 
Montgomery is a wild-card team that should play South Torrance (17-6) -- 
technically, the fourth-seeded team -- in the opening round. South Torrance won 
the Pioneer League. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the bracket, Newport Harbor Coach Shannon Jakosky was 
ecstatic about opening against third-seeded South Pasadena (19-2) after three 
years of having to go through No. 1 to reach the finals. Newport Harbor (19-6), 
a second-place team from a tough league (Sea View), is unseeded, but is clearly 
the favorite advance to the semifinals against Inglewood Morningside. 
</P>
<P>
 Sea View champion Woodbridge will play the winner of Wednesday's wild-card 
game between Trabuco Hills and Garden Grove, and would face the Rio Mesa-Villa 
Park winner in the II-A quarterfinals. Ocean View Coach Ollie Martin was 
pleased his team, seeded fourth, will play progressively better opponents 
leading up to Woodbridge in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-seeded Cypress (23-3) won't face unbeaten Mission Hills Alemany (23-0) 
until the II-A finals, though Katella (12-8) faces Alemany in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-seeded Mater Dei (20-3) hosts at-large Westminster (10-15) Wednesday; 
the Monarchs are expected to face Oxnard Channel Islands (22-3) in the 
semifinals. Ventura Buena (20-2) is No. 1 in Division I-A. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa (16-6) is seeded third in IV-AA; Rancho Alamitos (20-6) is third in 
III-A. 
</P>
<P>
 Century (12-11) will visit Division I-A's fourth-seeded team, San Clemente 
(18-5) on Wednesday.

PEPSI MAKES BIG PUSH IN CHINA'S INLAND MARKET; VENTURE: OFFICIALS IN VAST 
INTERIOR AREA ARE GRATIFIED BOTTLING COMPANY AND OTHER FIRMS ARE LOOKING BEYOND 
COASTAL REGIONS FOR INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sixteen years after Communist China opened to the West, the Pepsi Generation 
is coming to this city of 4 million deep in the nation's interior. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pepsi has been bottled and sold along the eastern seaboard since 
1982, the U.S.-based beverage giant is choosing inland locations for a big new 
push into the China market. It recently signed a $28-million deal to bottle its 
soft drinks in Chongqing, a commercial hub of southwest China. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inland cities became very attractive to us," said Miguel Ko, president of 
Pepsi-Cola International for China, before the Jan. 18 signing ceremony. Local 
dignitaries packed a hotel ballroom and sipped samples of Pepsi and its sister 
soft drink, 7-Up, rarely seen in Chongqing before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most multinationals are now looking beyond the traditional cities. They see 
the growth stretching beyond those areas," Ko said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's gratifying news to officials in China's vast interior, who have glumly 
watched coastal regions attract the majority of the foreign investment that is 
fueling a national economic boom. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also welcomed by Chinese leaders, who have been concerned that the 
widening gap between the rich eastern seaboard and the less-developed inland 
areas could arouse civil unrest. Already, an army of peasants from the interior 
are flooding coastal cities for work, overwhelming the railways and threatening 
social order. 
</P>
<P>
 Most foreign ventures have been set up along the coast, particularly in the 
south near Hong Kong, where they enjoyed tax breaks and close proximity to 
export markets. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the east coast wheezing under the sheer weight of that investment, 
which has triggered land speculation, clogged transportation links and sent 
wages soaring, the inland is looking increasingly attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Land costs are low, labor is cheap and the market is good," said Xiao Zuxiu, 
executive vice mayor of Chongqing. He says local laborers will work for as 
little as $23 a month, several times below the going rate along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 There are rich veins of natural resources. Officials in Chongqing and 
elsewhere in Sichuan province also claim a large pool of skilled workers from 
military factories and other heavy industry that were relocated inland decades 
earlier, when Chinese leaders feared a possible U.S. attack. 
</P>
<P>
 They are forever reminding foreigners of the potentially vast market here -- 
Sichuan alone has about 110 million people, more than all of Mexico -- where 
more and more entrepreneurs have money to burn. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sichuan's cities lack the five-star hotels and gleaming office towers 
of the coast and there are large pockets of rural poverty, Xiao notes that 
living standards are improving for many. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the watches and the clothing that our women are wearing," Xiao said. 
"They're not necessarily worse than what you see on the coast." 
</P>
<P>
 In just a few years time, Sichuan's capital of Chengdu has been transformed 
from a sleepy backwater to a city of night clubs, trendy boutiques and hundreds 
of beauty salons, including the Sichuan Haiyun Beauty Center that offers 
everything from facials to workouts at a state-of-the-art health club. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign investment is behind much of that business. Sichuan Haiyun, for 
example, was established by a Chinese American. 
</P>
<P>
 But what the inland really hungers for are large injections of foreign capital 
and technology in basic industry and infrastructure that have typically gone to 
coastal regions granted the greatest leeway in experimenting with capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Several major U.S. companies -- including AT&T, McDonnell Douglas Corp. and 
Procter & Gamble Co. -- already are in Sichuan or are coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the central government finally approved a Chongqing special 
economic zone along the Yangtze River to attract foreign investors that offers 
the same privileges available on the coast. Officials here say they already 
have signed up 166 projects with foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Gan Jiangang, a spokesman for the zone, proudly points to one site where huge 
concrete girders are beginning to form the shell of a factory that will house a 
$60-million joint venture to produce Honda motorcycle engines by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "The price of our land was very cheap, actually we didn't make any money," 
said Gan, noting that Honda was only charged the cost of relocating peasants 
who formerly lived on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 All this added up to a remarkable surge in foreign investment last year. 
Sichuan attracted 1,910 foreign-investment projects in 1993, nearly matching 
the total for all the years since China opened up to Western investors. Total 
contracted foreign investment for 1993 was $2.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 This helped Sichuan record an impressive 12.8% economic growth rate last year. 
Some of its chronically impoverished neighbors did well, too. Yunnan province 
grew 10%, and Guizhou and Qinghai provinces each grew 9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, those results didn't quite match the estimated 13% growth for the 
entire nation, indicating the interior -- far from export markets and weak in 
infrastructure -- is still losing ground to the east. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic growth was 25% in coastal Zhejiang province, where average urban per 
capita income was half again that of Sichuan. Rural incomes were more than 
twice as high. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanghai, a fraction the size of Sichuan, approved nearly twice as many 
foreign-funded projects last year with $7 billion in pledged foreign 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 So Sichuan is scrambling harder than ever for foreign investment. Last year, 
officials went to South Korea, Hong Kong, Thailand and Macao to drum up 
business. In April, they plan to head for Los Angeles and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the provincial governor, Xiao Yang, is preparing a rare trip abroad to 
convince Siemens of Germany to invest in a thermal power plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to go for the important ones, the large-scale projects with big 
investment," he said.

DON'T IGNORE RISKS WHEN DIVERSIFYING PORTFOLIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the art of personal money management, diversification is considered one of 
the great virtues. But, like any other virtue, it can be carried to a fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts say that is precisely what has been happening lately as people 
seek new investment alternatives in an era of low interest rates and high stock 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to a point, they say, it makes sense to mix something like a high-yield 
"junk" bond mutual fund or an international bond fund into a portfolio of 
investments designed to produce current income. 
</P>
<P>
 Such vehicles usually offer higher yields than better-quality corporate bonds 
or U.S. Treasury securities -- and at the same time may be less vulnerable to 
asset-value declines should interest rates rise in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, a solid case can be made for extending stock-market horizons beyond 
American markets, to allow for the possibility that great growth opportunities 
may lie outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the idea of diversifying is carried too far, it can turn into a 
self-deception, allowing the investor to take bigger gambles without 
acknowledging the hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many cases, investors have tried to maintain their income levels by moving 
further out on the risk spectrum into offshore income investments and the 
like," says Greg Smith, investment strategist at Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This necessity to take on ever greater risk in order to satisfy perceived or 
actual needs for income is ultimately a disturbing sign." 
</P>
<P>
 In stock investing, meanwhile, many analysts worry that investors are buying 
funds operating in "emerging markets" nations, going on the false premise that 
these faraway markets are as well-regulated and liquid as the ones they are 
familiar with at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no real quarrel with the long-term hypothesis that the economies of 
many emerging countries will offer the opportunity for better-than-average 
gains," Smith says. "But keep in mind that phrase 'long-term.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe many investors have been willing to take on more risk, sometimes 
rationalizing that it really represents diversification and therefore is not 
that risky. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd argue that many of these emerging markets are every bit as risky today as 
they've been historically. On the way to a long-term positive result, some 
breathtaking dips could shake out many investors who thought they were in for 
the long haul." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Lipper, head of the mutual-fund tracking firm Lipper Analytical 
Services, questions the assumption that spreading money among stocks of various 
countries automatically provides a cushion. 
</P>
<P>
 International and global stock funds often are promoted with the idea that 
other markets might hold steady or rise as U.S. stocks suffer a setback. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lipper suggests that is far from certain. In seven of the past 10 years, 
he notes, U.S. general equity funds, world equity funds, and U.S. taxable 
fixed-income funds all have posted gains together. 
</P>
<P>
 So it would be no surprise for all of them to decline simultaneously at some 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 Much has also been made of the fact that international markets lagged behind 
the performance of U.S. stocks for the three years before 1993, when they at 
last rallied. 
</P>
<P>
 This does not certify all foreign investments as "cheap," however. Standard 
value measures such as price-earnings ratios are high in most overseas markets 
-- even in Japan, although stock indexes there stand at less than half their 
highs of four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 To most experts, the first rule of investment safety is to diversify. But 
diversifying doesn't eliminate the need to understand and manage risks. 
</P>
<P>
 If you buy lottery tickets in several different states, instead of just the 
one you live in, you can tell yourself you have a diversified portfolio. But 
you still are playing the lottery.

 FAT PARTY: Everybody knows Monday was Valentine's Day. But did you know that 
today is another holiday? Mardi Gras enthusiasts do. Today is Fat Tuesday, 
traditionally the last night of Mardi Gras and the day before Lenten fasting 
begins. Among the Creole places celebrating: There's a Fat Tuesday party 
tonight, with saxophonist Paul Carmen, at Randell's Jazz Club at the Hutton 
Centre in Santa Ana. . . . Says spokesman Gary Baume: "Fat Tuesday is the 
post-party party. But my guess is some customers won't know what it is."

 SUDS HEAVEN: Oceans of beer -- poured a sample at a time -- will be washing 
around the Fullerton Hofbrau this weekend. The micro-brewery and restaurant is 
hosting its second annual Karnival of Beers and general manager Russell Brent 
says nearly 50 micro-breweries in the western United States will offer their 
suds for sipping. Designated drivers get $8 off the regular $20 admission price 
and "all the food and soda they can hold."

 SPECIAL APPLE: A great influence on Jan Kraushaar was Dr. Jo Stanchfield, one 
of her professors at Occidental College. So Kraushaar, an experienced 
elementary teacher from Irvine, jumped in when Stanchfield asked her help in 
organizing the American Literacy Corp. First, it must raise money, but 
eventually, it hopes to reward teachers doing special work in literacy. . . . 
"Bonuses and rewards are common in the corporate world," says Kraushaar. "But 
it's not often you see a bonus for teachers."

 FENDER'S WORLD: The Fullerton Museum Center will offer a bonus to its current 
exhibit on the late Leo Fender, a Fullerton resident legendary for making 
electric guitars. On Thursday, the museum will offer three afternoon tours of 
Fender's last factory. . . . It's not the place where he perfected his electric 
guitar, but he worked there the last decade of his life, and his workshop 
remains unchanged. The center warns that reservations for the tour, at $15, are 
a must.

DONALD JUDD; PIONEER OF MINIMALIST ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Donald Judd, prominent American postwar artist who spearheaded the minimalist 
art movement, has died at age 65. 
</P>
<P>
 Judd, who had homes in Manhattan, Marfa, Tex., and in Switzerland, died 
Saturday in New York City of lymphoma. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist preferred to work with solid geometric forms and was best known for 
his repetitive outsize boxes of stainless steel or plexiglass. He refused to 
call his art-form sculpture, claiming that word implied carving when his 
objects were factory built. He also disliked the word minimalist, preferring to 
call himself an empiricist. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is one of the crucial figures of the '60s generation. It is impossible to 
think of American art of that period without him," said Elizabeth C. Baker, 
editor of Art in America. 
</P>
<P>
 After studying philosophy at Columbia University, Judd was an abstract 
Expressionist painter in the 1950s, then moved to sculpture in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people I learned from were Jackson Pollock, Barnett Newman and Mark 
Rothko," Judd told The Times in 1984. "I learned in a very remote way. My work 
doesn't really resemble theirs, but I learned from them and there's no excess 
there. That's certainly clear." 
</P>
<P>
 Judd was known not only as an artist but as an outspoken art critic and 
defender of his work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody who defends their work is going to get in trouble," he once told 
The Times. "I'm difficult because my pieces cost a lot to make, they are large, 
I insist that they be installed well and that they be handled well." 
</P>
<P>
 Judd exhibited frequently in Southern California, as well as across the 
country and in Europe. In 1971, Times art critic William Wilson described a 
metal and plexiglass Judd display at the old Pasadena Art Museum as "a science 
fiction ghost town." 
</P>
<P>
 Judd could evoke unusual reactions simply by making his boxes in unexpected 
sizes and scale, Wilson noted, calling the exhibit "the Minimal Magician's 
Magical Media Mystery Show." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Margo Leavin Gallery exhibited 20 years of Judd's works in 1987, 
Times art writer Suzanne Muchnic evaluated: "The gleaming surfaces of Judd's 
stainless steel boxes, the structural variations of a 10-unit floor piece and 
the unexpected juxtapositions of color in recent painted wall pieces all 
project the idea of Judd as an innovator who pushes the limits of a rigid 
genre. 
</P>
<P>
 "A new, untouchably gorgeous work of anodized aluminum and copper confronts us 
with the sensual aspects of an artist who has long chafed against his 
minimalist label," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Judd also designed furniture, beginning with items for his children. That, 
too, was an outlet for his unique style of art. 
</P>
<P>
 "All natural wood and sharp right angles, Judd's tables and chairs are 
designed for the eye rather than the body," commented Times writer Kristine 
McKenna when Judd exhibited his furniture at Angles Gallery in Santa Monica in 
1985. "His pristine, cerebral objects are more concerned with exploring the 
idea of a chair than they are in providing a place to rest one's weary bones." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Excelsior Springs, Mo., Judd served in the Army during the Korean War, 
working on a design and construction team. He later studied painting at the Art 
Students League. 
</P>
<P>
 Judd's work also was exhibited by major museums including the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art, New York's Museum of Modern Art and Whitney Museum of 
Art, and the Kunstmuseum of Basel, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 Judd is survived by his daughter, Rainer, of Los Angeles; his son, Flavin, of 
New York; his mother, Effie, of Excelsior Springs, Mo., and his companion, 
Marianne Stockebrand.

SEVERELY BURNED CULT MEMBER TELLS COURT OF ORDEAL AT WACO COMPOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A weeping, severely burned Branch Davidian member described in videotaped 
testimony how her clothes and gas mask melted onto her skin as she fled the 
cult's burning compound. 
</P>
<P>
 Marjorie Thomas, whose testimony was played Monday at the federal 
murder-conspiracy trial of 11 followers of David Koresh, was granted immunity 
from prosecution.Four agents of the federal bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms were killed as agents stormed the compound near Waco on Feb. 28, 1993, 
and six Davidians are believed to have died. 
</P>
<P>
 The botched raid led to a 51-day standoff, which ended in a raging fire April 
19. Koresh and 78 followers died in the blaze. Eighteen cult members had been 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 As her clothes and gas mask melted onto her, Thomas said, she fell to the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could feel my legs moving furiously," Thomas said. " . . . I don't know 
where I got the strength from, but I managed to get up . . . . I made my way 
towards the light." Despite her fear of heights, she said, she jumped from an 
upper story. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say the fire was part of a mass suicide pact. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, a former Seventh-Day Adventist from Britain, was burned over 51% of 
her body and testified by videotape because of her injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas also testified that she saw defendants Ruth Riddle, Jaime Castillo and 
Brad Branch with guns the day of the shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said that during the standoff, she saw defendants Kevin Whitecliff, 
Clive Doyle, Graeme Craddock and Renos Avraam with guns. Thomas said she also 
had a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Under cross-examination, Thomas said she never heard the defendants plan to 
harm federal agents.  
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys contend the Davidians were acting in self-defense. They face 
up to life in prison if convicted.

815-HOME DEVELOPMENT PLAN WITHDRAWN; VENTURA: BRAD JONES DECIDES NOT TO PRESENT 
HIS PROPOSAL AT COUNCIL MEETING. HE SAYS HE HOPES TO MEET WITH NEIGHBORS WHO 
OPPOSED PROJECT FOR 222 ACRES OF AGRICULTURAL LAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Backing down from the prospect of a messy public defeat, a Ventura developer 
who had hoped to build a large housing project on agricultural land on the 
city's east end withdrew his proposal hours before Monday's City Council 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Jones, in partnership with the property owner, Limco Del Mar Ltd., had 
sought to build 815 houses on 222 acres of lemon orchards just east of North 
Hill Road, between Foothill and Telegraph roads. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the city Monday, Jones said the developers "had received 
comments and critique regarding our application from several city 
representatives and other members of the community, which we would like to 
evaluate before proceeding further." 
</P>
<P>
 In brief remarks to the council Monday, Jones said he wants to meet with 
residents to discuss the project. He declined in an interview later to say 
whether he hopes to pursue a revised version of the development or scrap it 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gregory L. Carson said he encouraged Jones in a meeting last week 
to drop the proposal because a majority of the council would be unlikely to 
support the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson said that voting in favor of the proposal would mean changing the 
city's Comprehensive Plan, which dictates that the agricultural greenbelt be 
off-limits to development until 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him that to get a 'no' vote from the council would be detrimental," 
Carson said Monday. "I think he needs to sell it to the community first before 
selling it to the council." 
</P>
<P>
 Since last week, residents near the greenbelt have been circulating petitions 
and calling council members urging them to vote against Jones' project. 
Residents say new houses are not needed in the area and would create huge 
traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll make this into a slum city," said Sy Einstoss, who lives near the 
proposed development. "We can't accommodate any more people." 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of residents who did not know about Jones' last-minute withdrawal 
showed up at Monday's meeting to oppose the project, some carrying protest 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may just be a delaying tactic," Einstoss said at the meeting. "He may 
come back in six months" to resubmit the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also at Monday's meeting, the council discussed another project that would 
affect the agricultural buffer on the east end. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura-based developer Ron Hertel asked the council for permission to proceed 
with his plan, which involves swapping his 92 acres in the greenbelt for 87 
acres of city-owned land at Telegraph Road and Petit Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Hertel would build single-family houses on the city-owned land, and give the 
city $2 million to build a park on the land he owns at Telephone and Kimball 
roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The council debated late into the evening whether to allow the land swap. 
Council members were faced with deciding whether to permit the plan to go 
forward or rejecting it outright. Even if council members grant preliminary 
permission for the plan to move ahead, they could withhold final approval until 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 The 900-acre greenbelt, which stretches from Foothill Road to the Santa Clara 
River, was established by the City Council in 1989. The land is in an 
unincorporated area of the county, but is surrounded by the city and could be 
annexed at any time with the approval of county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city's Comprehensive Plan dictates that development of the 
greenbelt not be considered before 2010, a majority vote of the council could 
change that policy at any time.

QUAKE VICTIMS ANXIOUS TO START OVER ARE FACING A HOST OF PROBLEMS; FILLMORE: 
LACK OF INCOME AND AFFORDABLE RENTALS MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO FIND NEW HOMES. BUT 
OFTEN, THE SIZE OF MANY FAMILIES IS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE, OFFICIALS SAY.

<P>
 Nearly a month after an earthquake crumpled their dwellings, about 65 Fillmore 
residents still make their homes on cots at a Red Cross shelter -- rejected by 
landlords who shun large families or victims of their own determination to stay 
near their jobs and in a community they love. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the low-income families that cluster in groups at a school gymnasium 
say there are no affordable rentals left in Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 They search for housing when not working in the lemon groves that ring 
Fillmore, and listen for word that government-funded trailers have arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 But many families -- some with five, six or seven children -- still see no 
immediate way out of the clean, new Fillmore Middle School gymnasium. They 
appreciate the accommodations but are eager to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no privacy," Deana Gonzales, 29, said as her three small children 
played nearby. Her 10-month old, Nykidemuz, learned to walk at the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we want to stay here in Fillmore," she said. "I grew up here. It's such a 
nice little community." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gonzales family had expected to be out of Ventura County's only remaining 
earthquake shelter by mid-afternoon. But their hopes were dashed when they 
discovered that a Fillmore landlord agreed to rent them a condo that city 
officials say is still unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 A shelter dweller for 28 days, Jess Gonzales, 29, cried out in frustration: 
"It's a big deal. I have everything ready to go, and I find out the owner had 
us go through all this under a yellow tag." 
</P>
<P>
 Housing authorities said Monday that families still in the Fillmore shelter 
face a number of handicaps not easily overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Some workers who live at the shelter lost their jobs because of damage to 
packinghouses in Fillmore and Piru, said David Roddick, housing director of the 
Area Housing Authority of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That stops some landlords because, even with federal housing subsidies, the 
families must pay 30% of their income as rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Owners still want to run background checks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other workers walk to their jobs or ride in car pools from their old 
neighborhoods, Roddick said. So a move to Santa Paula, where low-cost housing 
is available, is nearly impossible for a worker without a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, the biggest obstacle is the sheer size of the displaced family, said 
Roddick and workers at the Fillmore shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these are large families, and the owners are reluctant. They fear 
the place won't be kept nice," said Lupe Denette, a county mental health worker 
who counsels at the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "One lady came in," Denette added. "She had a four-bedroom house she wanted to 
rent. But when she found out that the families had six or seven children, she 
said she would be back at 3. We never heard from her again." 
</P>
<P>
 Some families are handicapped too because they have never rented a dwelling 
themselves, living instead with members of their extended family, Roddick said. 
Several shelter dwellers who lived at the now-demolished Fillmore Hotel were in 
that situation, workers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two federal housing counselors have begun helping some of the families by 
"taking them by the hand and helping them hunt for apartments," Roddick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, federal workers cannot recommend a specific landlord to prospective 
tenants, but that rule has been waived temporarily for the federal counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the lure of Fillmore itself. A number of the families at the 
shelter Monday said they wanted or needed to stay in town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was born and raised here, and I want to bring my kids up here," said Linda 
Acosta, a 40-year-old mother of four. She knew other families at the shelter 
even before the quake. "So we're all a big extended family." 
</P>
<P>
 But staying in town seems increasingly problematic, she said. "What is left is 
substandard housing," she said. "It won't pass inspection." 
</P>
<P>
 For the displaced, one potential problem never developed. 
</P>
<P>
 The exclusion of illegal immigrants from $8.6-billion in federal quake 
benefits has not been an issue here, Roddick said, because that exclusion is 
handled the same way as the prohibition of gays in the military. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our direction from HUD is essentially the same as the order about gays in the 
military -- don't ask," he said. "Housing authority people do not have the 
training to make sure a green card is good. But if it is known to us, we will 
not issue them a certificate." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, many of the shelter residents said they had lived in the United 
States for many years or decades, and many knew each other long before the 
earthquake threw them together Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they live as a mini-community, their goods stacked in cardboard boxes and 
plastic bags along the gym walls, and their conduct so disciplined that they 
could hardly seem more compatible, said shelter manager Elmer Fulesday, a Red 
Cross worker from Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all from the same neighborhood and all know one another," he said. 
"That's the nice thing about this shelter." 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter is as neat as the homes the dwellers left behind, some said. Each 
of the "shelter moms" keeps her family's area tidy, and all pitch in to clean 
common areas and watch out for the children's safety, Acosta said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody volunteers," she said. "We have our juniors who love wearing their 
Junior Volunteer Red Cross stickers. They even clean up the bathrooms. It just 
works out."

IDOLS INSPIRE FANS TO SPIN ICY FANTASIES; SKATING: WATCHING THE WINTER GAMES 
SPURS AMATEURS TO STRAP ON THE BLADES, BUT TRUE DEVOTEES HAVE A SINGLE-MINDED 
PASSION FOR THE SPORT.

 Shannon Murphy has a long brown ponytail, sleek white ice-skates and dreams 
the size of an Olympic stadium.  
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be a national, an Olympics, a world champion," said Shannon, 13, 
curled up next to a heater at the Conejo Valley Ice Skating Center last week. 
"I want to be every champion there is." 
</P>
<P>
 The scandal surrounding U. S. figure skater Tonya Harding may have tarnished 
the sport in some eyes, but for young fans like Shannon and a hundred other 
dedicated figure skaters who practice at the Newbury Park rink, the appeal 
endures. 
</P>
<P>
 Their days start with a practice session at the crack of dawn. Afternoons are 
spent doing jumps and figures. Other kids run for student council or strive to 
make the school basketball team, but for serious young figure skaters, hopes 
begin and end at the rink. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Valley Ice Skating Center -- which will soon move to larger 
quarters in Simi Valley -- is the only commercial ice-skating rink in Ventura 
County and a home-away-from-home for would-be Kristi Yamaguchis and Wayne 
Gretzkys. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And with the start of the Winter Olympics, it is also a crowded hot spot for 
those trying to emulate the moves that look so beautiful and graceful on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 "In an Olympic year . . . people get all fired up about ice-skating," said 
Bette Robinson, Shannon's grandmother and the rink's office manager. "They all 
want to skate." 
</P>
<P>
 Every Saturday and Sunday in recent weeks, the rink has been jammed with 
novice skaters, many attempting merely to stay upright on the slippery, 
unforgiving surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Twins Sara and Brian Dean, 17, and friends Erin Coepcke, 15, and Scott Feitl, 
18, tried the ice at the Conejo Valley rink Sunday for the first time since 
childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been watching all the ice-skating on TV, and so we came because we had 
nothing else to do," said Sara, a Camarillo resident who was adjusting her boot 
laces by the side of the rink. "But it looks a lot easier on television!" 
</P>
<P>
 With the Olympic skating competitions already under way, some pleasure skaters 
-- especially young girls -- considered their own gold medal potential Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really like it, but I guess I could learn," said Nicole Guilis, 11, 
of Oak Park. "The skates hurt my feet. I like roller-skating because you don't 
fall and, like, get your butt all wet." 
</P>
<P>
 Britt Boisclair, 10, sipping hot chocolate during a skating break, said the 
life of a skating champion would not mesh with her hectic schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not that kind of person who can find the time for all that skating 
because I'm too busy," said Britt of Agoura Hills, who plays street hockey with 
her friends, attends dance and tennis lessons, and plays on a soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, serious figure skating requires a degree of dedication and 
single-mindedness that would deter many children, not to mention their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 For Shannon Murphy, who first wiggled into ice-skates at age 3, the routine 
begins each weekday morning at 5:30, when she hauls herself out of bed and 
dresses for the rink. 
</P>
<P>
 By 6:45 at the latest, Shannon, who lives with her grandmother in Ventura, is 
at the Conejo Valley rink. After stretching exercises with her coach, she 
practices her figures and double axels, along with two dozen other serious 
young skaters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Practice continues until 9 a.m., when Shannon -- whose ice-skating fulfills 
her school's physical education requirement -- gets ready to attend Colina 
Intermediate School in Thousand Oaks at 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, she returns at 2:45 p.m. for another couple 
of hours on the ice. Saturdays are easier: only two hours of lessons and 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's really stressful," said Shannon, who in April placed fourth in 
the intermediate ladies division of the Junior Nationals competition in Great 
Falls, Mont. "I've got so many classes and so much work. I think about skating 
when I'm in class, and I'd rather do skating than be at school." 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, Shannon and her grandmother have been considering pulling her out of 
school and enrolling her in a home study program -- popular with many of the 
most serious junior high and high school skaters. 
</P>
<P>
 When Shannon skated in a recent competition, Robinson said, she had to divide 
her time between competing and getting her schoolwork done by the teachers' 
deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got pressure on both sides, and I don't want them both to cave in," 
Robinson said. "And she's not going to give up skating at this point. She's put 
in too many years and been too successful." 
</P>
<P>
 But adolescents aren't the only ones for whom figure skating is a big 
commitment. Many parents spend a small fortune -- up to $30,000 per year, some 
say -- outfitting future Katarina Witts with two and three pairs of 
custom-fitted skates, heavily beaded costumes and lessons not only in 
ice-skating, but in related fields like dance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's expensive," said Cathy O'Donnell of Woodland Hills, whose daughter 
Elizabeth, 12, trains in Newbury Park and at a rink in Burbank. "We spent about 
$1,000 on one of her costumes. It is solid beads and a beautiful chiffon skirt 
and weighs more, almost, than she does." 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents spend up to $1,000 per month on lessons, and rink time can cost 
an additional $50 to $200 per month, depending on the number of practice 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the money spent on some skaters, the nearly two-decades-old 
Conejo Valley arena looks battered and timeworn. Clothes-changing facilities 
are minimal, lighting is dim in places, and some skaters complain that the ice 
is not as hard as in the best skating rinks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In August or September, Icetime Unlimited Inc. will close the Newbury Park 
rink and open a new facility on West Easy Street in Simi Valley, complete with 
training rooms, a pro shop, and Olympic- and regulation-size ice rinks, said 
Sean McGillivray, president of Icetime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to really serve the public," McGillivray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Figure skating interest at the rink, he said, has been up 30% in the last 
couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Olympics always gives great exposure and drives up participation and, as 
you know, this is our second in two years," he said. "Also, we've had really 
good exposure nationally the last couple years, with national figure skaters 
who paved the way." 
</P>
<P>
 But McGillivray said youth hockey, not figure skating, is where demand 
continues to grow. Five years ago, he said, 85 children belonged to the Conejo 
Valley rink's youth hockey league. Today, more than 400 young hockey players 
practice and compete at the rink. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wayne Gretzky had a tremendous impact," he said, referring to the Los Angeles 
Kings star. "Another reason for it is roller-blading. . . . You see these kids 
skating around with hockey sticks and roller-blades on and it's a natural 
transition. If kids like roller-blading, ice-skating is tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the young skaters, however, eschew any surface but ice and any sport 
but figure skating. For Shannon, who memorizes videos of past Olympics and 
world championship competitions in her spare time, it is the activity around 
which life revolves.

ELECTIONS; 7 OFFICIALS ANNOUNCE THEY WILL RUN JUNE 7; CAMPAIGNS: FOUR 
APPOINTEES ARE AMONG THOSE WHO FILE CANDIDACY PAPERS FOR PUBLIC OFFICE. ONLY 
TWO IN THE GROUP ARE OPPOSED SO FAR. 
</P>

<P>
 Seven of Ventura County's top public officials, including four appointed 
administrators, kicked off their political campaigns Monday by formally 
declaring their candidacies for office. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, County Clerk Richard Dean and Treasurer-Tax 
Collector Harold S. Pittman, all unopposed so far in the June 7 primary 
election, were among those who gathered in the county's elections office to 
take out their nomination papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Larry Carpenter, Auditor-Controller Thomas O. Mahon, county Supt. of 
Schools Charles Weis and Assessor Glenn E. Gray also declared their 
candidacies. All four were appointed to serve out the terms of their 
predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only Mahon and Gray are opposed. Mahon will square off against Simi 
Valley Mayor Greg Stratton and Ventura accountant Scott Weiss, while Gray will 
compete against Ventura Councilman Jack Tingstrom. 
</P>
<P>
 The final date to file papers to run for office is March 11. 
</P>
<P>
 In other county elections, veteran defense attorney James M. Farley said 
Monday that he will challenge Assistant Dist. Atty. Colleen Toy White in the 
contest to replace retiring Superior Court Judge Edwin M. Osborne. 
</P>
<P>
 Farley, a Ventura attorney with 27 years of experience, said he is more suited 
than White to the job because of that experience. He said White has served most 
of her 17 years in the district attorney's office as an administrator, not as a 
prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Superior Court is a trial court," Farley said. "You should have 
experience and know what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 White, whose decision to run for Osborne's post prompted several of her 
colleagues to bow out of the race, could not be reached for comment Monday. She 
announced her candidacy Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of White's peers said she is unbeatable. Bradbury said last week that 
there was no one better qualified for the job, while Deputy Dist. Atty. Matthew 
J. Hardy went one step further, saying, "You'd have a better shot at running 
against Mother Teresa in this county." 
</P>
<P>
 But Farley said he is not deterred. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, Toy White is not Mother Teresa," he said. "And, second, I 
checked with Mother Teresa, and she said I could run." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Bradbury, who is seeking his fifth term as district attorney, said 
he does not expect anyone to challenge him in the June primary. Bradbury has 
run unopposed since he was first elected in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 If returned to office, Bradbury said his top priorities will be to restore 
cuts made to his prosecutorial staff last year and to replace his office's 
antiquated computer system. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system we have now is from the Dark Ages," said Bradbury, who oversees 
nearly 500 employees. "It's important if we want to be able to operate 
efficiently through the year 2000 that we have an updated system." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter, who is running in his first election for sheriff, said his main 
focus if elected would be to continue to protect funding for his department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The financing of law enforcement has to rank as the No. 1 issue in our 
lifetime," Carpenter said. "What I'm going to be working toward is maintaining 
services on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Weis, who was appointed last summer, said improving the quality of education 
in Ventura County schools to better prepare students for the 21st Century and 
developing new strategies to combat increasing incidents of school violence are 
among his top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen a significant increase in violence," Weis said. "It's a problem 
we have to tackle in the community, not just the schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Resolving the problem, he added, "is going to take a community effort between 
law enforcement, parents, kids and school officials."

COMMUTERS, OFFICIALS BREAK IN CAMARILLO RAIL STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shivering in the pre-dawn chill Monday, commuters and transit officials 
huddled in Camarillo's freshly paved Metrolink parking lot, eager to celebrate 
the opening of the emergency train station. 
</P>
<P>
 Riders helped themselves to free coffee, doughnuts and newspapers as workers 
sporting purple Metrolink caps and T-shirts worked the crowd, selling tickets 
and handing out train schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Purple and white helium-filled balloons tethered to a freshly installed 
railing spruced up the otherwise stark station. 
</P>
<P>
 Approved by the Ventura County Transportation Commission just 11 days ago and 
constructed in less than a week, the Camarillo station at Lewis Road and 
Ventura Boulevard contains only the bare essentials: a concrete platform, a pay 
phone, wheelchair ramp and train tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the station was designed to operate for one year to offer relief from 
post-quake freeway congestion, officials said they are optimistic that 
ridership will prompt construction of a permanent stop. 
</P>
<P>
 At the early morning celebration, however, politicians, media and transit 
officials outnumbered riders. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking from a portable podium, County Supervisor Maggie Kildee asked, "How 
many of you are real commuters?" About a dozen onlookers raised their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good," Kildee said. "You are what this is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the second of two morning trains pulled away from the Camarillo 
station, about 90 commuters had boarded the Los Angeles-bound trains, said Mary 
Travis, manager of transit programs for the county Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good start," Travis said. "As the word gets around, we expect the 
numbers to grow." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 earthquake, ridership on the 47-mile Ventura Line has jumped 
40%, holding steady at about 1,500 passengers each way, Travis said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That increase prompted transit officials to seek the $1.9 million needed to 
extend service to Camarillo. If the aid application is approved, the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency will pay 75%, the state Office of Emergency 
Services 18.75% and the county 6.25%. 
</P>
<P>
 Success of the station hinges on whether Metrolink's first west county stop 
will attract new riders or simply offer added convenience for commuters who had 
been boarding the train in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard resident Jack Burger said he first stepped aboard a Metrolink train 
last week when he started a new job as a logistics analyst in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started off on the Moorpark train, but this one is even better because it's 
closer," Burger said. "It's about time we had the chance to take the train to 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Moorpark Metrolink rider Douglas Ernst said he enjoys the hourlong 
ride, which allows him to stretch out in a padded, high-backed chair and work 
on his laptop computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernst, a real estate banker who works in downtown Los Angeles, said he decided 
to try boarding in Camarillo because the station is closer to his Oxnard home. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ernst said the flexibility of the Moorpark Metrolink schedule may entice 
him to return to that station. 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo schedule calls for only two round-trip trains a day, while 
Moorpark and Simi Valley offer five round-trip trains a day and two round-trip 
Amtrak trains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Camarillo is closer, but if I leave my car there, work late and miss my 
train, I'm dead," Ernst said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Newbury Park residents Loris and James Mitchell, the Camarillo stop means 
that the couple will be able to spend more time together. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, a computer analyst who works in Los Angeles, had been spending 
several nights a week in the city to avoid the hassle of riding the daily 
commuter bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just took so long for him to get to work and get home, it was wearing him 
out," Loris Mitchell said. "We tried taking him to the Moorpark station, but 
that was a bit too far to go twice a day to drop him off and pick him up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the first day of Camarillo Metrolink service barely under way, frazzled 
transit officials had already shifted their attention to their next task, 
extending Metrolink service to Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA on Friday agreed to include Oxnard in the earthquake disaster zone, 
clearing the way for the city to apply for federal funding for commuter rail 
service to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Travis said the county has begun negotiating with Metrolink officials to come 
up with a cost estimate to extend service to Oxnard's 4th Street transit 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 If the federal funding is approved, the commission must find enough money to 
cover that cost until FEMA comes through with reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with federal dollars is that you have to front the money and get 
reimbursed," Travis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Travis said the commission should have more details on Metrolink service to 
Oxnard by midweek, including the cost of operating the station and a proposed 
launch date for service. Camarillo Metrolink Service Metrolink trains began 
operating out of the Camarillo station Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: 30 Lewis Road at Ventura Boulevard, just south of the Ventura Freeway. 
Exit freeway at either Carmen Drive or Dawson Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Monday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Times: Trains depart at 5:44 a.m. and 6:34 a.m. and return at 6:30 p.m. and 
7:03 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking: 240-space paved parking lot at the Metrolink station. 
</P>
<P>
 Access: Trains are wheelchair accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: A round-trip ticket to Los Angeles costs $12. A monthly pass is $176.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO DEFRAUDING BANKS

<P>
 A 26-year-old man charged with defrauding seven Ventura County banks out of 
more than $17,000 in a credit-card scam pleaded not guilty Monday in Ventura 
County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Charles R. McGrath set a March 21 trial for David Jeffrey Wilkinson of 
West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. William R. Redmond said Wilkinson remains in Ventura County 
Jail in lieu of $25,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Wilkinson used fraudulently acquired credit cards to withdraw 
money from banks from Thousand Oaks to Ventura, including six Bank of A. Levy 
branches. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Wilkinson faces up to six years in state prison on charges of 
commercial burglary, grand theft and credit-card fraud. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; DANCE FOR DISABLED TEEN-AGERS PLANNED

<P>
 Organizers of a "Wild, Wild West" dinner-dance for Thousand Oaks teen-agers 
with disabilities are looking for donations of prizes for participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of disabled teen-agers are expected to attend the fourth annual event 
Feb. 26, said Cecilia McMullen, therapeutic recreation coordinator with the 
Conejo Recreation and Park District. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is one of the only opportunities for them to be at such a 
large-scale event with all of their friends," McMullen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening begins at 5 p.m. with a barbecue dinner at the Thousand Oaks Teen 
Center. The dance follows from 7 to 10 p.m. The teen center will be decked out 
in Western style, and party-goers are invited to do the same, McMullen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Every participant receives a bag of small prizes to take home as souvenirs, 
McMullen said. To donate items or make a reservation to join the fun, call 
McMullen at 496-2464. 
</P>
<P>
 The admission charge is $3, but the sponsoring Thousand Oaks Youth Commission 
will waive the fee for teen-agers who are unable to pay, McMullen said. BRENDA

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SUPERVISORS MAY SPEND $70,000 ON SAFETY STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County supervisors today will consider spending almost $70,000 to 
study how to make their employees more secure in their workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 The report was requested by supervisors after the deadly rampage that began at 
the Oxnard unemployment office last December and left five people dead, 
including gunman Alan Winterbourne and Oxnard Police Detective James O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least one supervisor said the $69,900 might be better spent elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I would vote for this," said Supervisor John K. Flynn, who 
represents the district where the Dec. 2 shooting began. "I'm very concerned 
about employee safety, but I'd rather spend $70,000 putting in some protective 
windows or hiring a security guard" than on a study. A committee of top 
department heads and other officials was formed following the rampage to study 
ways to tighten security at the county's numerous office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 After each department submitted security alternatives to committee members, 
the panel solicited bids from consultants for a comprehensive security plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract proposal up for consideration today asks supervisors to approve 
spending $69,900 to hire Tomasi-Dubois & Associates of Los Gatos to perform the 
three-month study. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really have reservations about putting that much money into a consultant's 
contract," Flynn said. JEFF McDONALD

<P>
 Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) will meet with local and state officials 
today to discuss emergency responses to the recent earthquake as well as the 
December oil spill at McGrath Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting at Gallegly's Oxnard office will replace a discussion planned Jan. 
18 that was canceled because of the Northridge earthquake.Rescheduling will 
give Gallegly a chance to include the emergency response to the temblor in the 
discussion, said John Frith, an aide to the congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We planned to have this meeting, ironically enough, the day after the 
earthquake, so of course it was postponed," Frith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the invited guests are state Office of Emergency Services Director 
Richard Andrews and local elected and public safety officials, Frith said. The 
meeting is not open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 At least six local agencies were alerted to the McGrath Lake spill the day 
before it was officially announced, allowing thousands more gallons of heavy 
crude to pollute the ecologically sensitive habitat. JEFF McDONALD

 Simi Valley residents seeking quake-related legal assistance are invited to 
attend a public forum at 6:30 tonight at Simi Valley City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 A panel of attorneys, judges and government officials will discuss rent 
payment on damaged residences, insurance coverage and reconstruction costs.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; WOMAN PERJURED IN DEFENSE OF HUSBAND

<P>
 A former Simi Valley woman whose husband was convicted last June of molesting 
a young girl pleaded guilty on Monday to lying for the man during his trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Elba Centobene, 33, entered the plea of one count of perjury and is expected 
to receive probation, authorities said.She is eligible to receive a prison term 
of up to four years under state law. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, 29-year-old James Centobene, was convicted of 25 criminal counts 
in connection with sexual assaults on the girl from January, 1991, to January, 
1992, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona. The attacks occurred while the girl 
was 9 and 10 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury found James Centobene guilty of 23 counts of child molestation, 
including 15 that included special allegations of substantial sexual conduct, 
indicating either sexual penetration or oral copulation. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury also convicted him of two counts of child annoyance, which stem from 
baths he took with the girl, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 During her husband's trial last year, Elba Centobene testified that the man 
never admitted to her that he had molested the child. Police, however, had 
taped a phone call between the two in which the admissions were made. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his conviction, James Centobene has fired his attorney and is 
representing himself. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Friday but has asked 
Superior Court Judge James McNally for a new trial. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; NEW POLICE STATION COULD COST $11.3 
MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley's cramped, aging, earthquake-damaged police headquarters could be 
replaced with a new building within four years at a cost of up to $11.3 million 
if money can be found to pay for it, according to a report released Monday by 
the city manager's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage to the Cochran Street headquarters in the Jan. 17 earthquake can be 
repaired economically, City Manager M. Lin Koester wrote in the report.But the 
damage also "emphasizes the need to examine alternatives for a new police 
facility." 
</P>
<P>
 The two buildings now used by Simi Valley police -- built in 1968 and 1971, 
with additions made in 1973 -- were intended only as temporary buildings and 
were not built to present-day standards, Koester said Monday in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 They would not last the 30 to 50 years that a modern structure would last, and 
some components are aging even faster, he reported. The heating, ventilation 
and air-conditioning system, for instance, is not expected to be economical to 
run for more than another four to five years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Koester's report recommends that the city review the Police Department's space 
needs, identify potential sites for a new headquarters and review methods of 
paying for construction. 
</P>
<P>
 If begun in March, paid for, approved and built every step of the way without 
a hitch, a new headquarters could be ready to occupy by January, 1998, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the city is making extensive repairs to the existing 
headquarters, including jacking it up about six inches to the elevation it was 
before the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs are expected to last about 70 days and cost about $200,000. MACK REED

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: EPA TO RELEASE CLEAN AIR PLAN FOR COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency today will release a plan to clean 
Ventura County skies by imposing mandates on farmers and others who contribute 
to the 10th-worst air quality in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft will allow for a public comment period of at least six months before 
a final air quality plan is approved next year, EPA officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is the result of a series of lawsuits brought against the EPA for 
failing to require local air pollution control districts in the Los Angeles, 
Ventura County and Sacramento areas to comply with the federal Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would allow the three areas, which account for 15 million people and 
half the state's population, 10 years to reach federal health standards for 
clean air. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizens to Preserve the Ojai sued the EPA in 1988, claiming that the 
government failed to adhere to its own air quality standards. But group 
officials earlier this month agreed in a split vote not to contest the 10-year 
attainment schedule proposed by EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 "We asked for a clear, comprehensive plan that the citizens could readily 
understand before 2005, preferably by 2002," said Pat Baggerly, one of the 
opponents of the agreement. "But they just kept saying no." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan to be released today will very likely include mandates that farmers 
restrict the use of certain pesticides that contain air pollutants as well as 
other measures to improve the air quality, EPA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the magnitude of reductions necessary to attain the health 
standard in these three areas, the (plans) will call for emission reductions 
from most every stationary and mobile source of air emissions," EPA spokesman 
Bill Glenn said. JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY URGED TO OK CAR-POOL INCENTIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County employees should continue to be paid to share rides to work 
while alternative plans are drawn up to offer time off instead as an incentive 
to induce them to use car pools next year, a county official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Bandoli, Ventura County employee transportation coordinator, said the 
Board of Supervisors should approve a program today that continues to encourage 
employees to share rides to work. 
</P>
<P>
 But supervisors should also direct department heads to begin studying the 
possibility of establishing a parking fee program to motivate workers to find 
alternatives to driving their cars to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors had earlier asked Bandoli to devise alternatives to the 
cash-incentive plan as a means of saving money. The county spent about $330,000 
on the incentive program last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Rule 210, the county's strict trip-reduction ordinance adopted to help 
curb air pollution, businesses and agencies employing 100 or more people must 
provide incentives to reduce the number of people driving alone to work. The 
initial target is an average of 1.35 people per car. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1997, however, average ridership must rise to 1.5 people per car, or three 
people for every two vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a survey conducted last year, the county is in compliance with 
the current mandate at 1.38 people per car. But the county might have trouble 
reaching the 1.5-people-per-car goal by 1997, as Rule 210 requires, Bandoli 
told supervisors in his report. 
</P>
<P>
 He recommends that the board approve a series of programs aimed at reaching 
the ride-sharing goal, including continuing the four-day workweek for most 
county employees. 
</P>
<P>
 To otherwise reach the requirements of Rule 210, the board could require 
employees to car-pool as a condition of employment, or direct department heads 
to implement individual ride-sharing programs, Bandoli said. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; PLANNERS TO CONSIDER FACTORY OUTLET MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Camarillo Planning Commission tonight will consider approving a 
controversial 22-acre factory outlet mall to be located south of the Ventura 
Freeway between Las Posas Road and Carmen Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will mark the second time that the commission has considered the 
250,000-square-foot mall.Last year, both the commission and the City Council 
approved the proposal only to have those decisions overturned by a lawsuit 
filed by an Oxnard developer and a retired Camarillo businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the lawsuit, a Ventura Superior Court judge blocked the project 
and declared the city's attempt to provide tax rebates to the developer as a 
gift of public funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also required that the site be scrutinized by a full environmental 
impact report. Before the project can be approved, the commissioners tonight 
will have to certify that report and accept its recommendations dealing with 
traffic, noise and air pollution generated by the proposed facility. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the mall will be the second factory outlet complex in Ventura 
County. A similar-size facility recently broke ground in Oxnard, about five 
miles north of the proposed Camarillo mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's meeting tonight begins at 7:30 p.m. at City Hall, 601 Carmen 
Drive. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; WOODEN HOMES BUILT FOR NESTING SWALLOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tree swallows whose Ventura County nesting sites have been lost to agriculture 
or development have found help from a pair of Ventura Audubon Society members 
who are building and mounting wooden houses for the birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Wasserman of Camarillo adopted the bird house project seven years ago and 
enlisted retired Navy engineer Virgil Ketner to help with the woodworking. 
Together, the two have mounted 50 swallow boxes atop predator-proof plastic 
poles at the Saticoy Settling Ponds, owned by United Water Conservation 
District. They have another 150 houses for a variety of birds at the Taft Ranch 
in the Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It brought swallows back to the county," said Wasserman, a former insurance 
claims adjuster who now works full-time on protecting and monitoring the birds. 
"They're such beautiful birds." 
</P>
<P>
 The migratory swallows, which winter in Central America, nest in hallowed 
knots in dead or rotting trees from California to Canada. But with the 
destruction of much of the older stands of trees in the county, tree swallows 
have been forced to find homes elsewhere in recent years, said Cat Brown, 
biologist with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasserman's love for birds began eight years ago when her husband, Harold, 
called her into the back yard to watch as a wild blue jay plucked a peanut from 
her husband's hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "He regrets that to this day because it changed my life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon afterward, she quit her job and became a birder full-time. Her husband 
and his income-tax business, along with assistance from the Audubon Society, 
support her program. They pay for colored bands to mark the birds so that 
Wasserman can tell if the same animals return each year. 
</P>
<P>
 And they do, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They return not only to the same area, but to the same house," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ketner said he got involved with the project when he and Wasserman were 
birding together at the settling ponds three years ago and noticed swallows 
flying around with no place to nest. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasserman, who had already taken over a project under way at John Taft's 
ranch, enlisted Ketner to help her expand the project to the new site, and 
increase the number of houses at the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 The boxes measure about 5 inches by 5 inches by 10 inches high, ample room for 
the tiny birds, which are slightly larger than finches. In past years, all of 
the boxes have had nesters and fledglings in the spring, Wasserman said. More 
than 300 young swallows have been fledged at the Saticoy site and more than 
2,500 of various species have been hatched at Taft Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're excited to see what's going to happen this year," she said. JOANNA M.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; DISTRICT ASKED TO PAY FOR TRACK, SNACK BAR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying the school district may have to spend money to make money, a booster 
club has asked Oxnard school officials to foot the bill for an all-weather 
track and snack bar at the new Oxnard High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard High School Athletics Booster Club has asked the Oxnard Union High 
School District to pay $175,000 for the track and an additional $200,000 for a 
snack bar on condition that the parent group raise funds to repay all of the 
construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The booster club previously agreed to raise $500,000 to build the track, snack 
bar and field house at the new campus, scheduled to open in January. 
</P>
<P>
 But club leaders told the school board last week that the track and snack bar 
would help them reach their fund-raising goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The club could earn money through the track by charging fees for statewide and 
regional track and field competitions, Booster Club President Larry Bumpus told 
the school board last week. And the snack bar would generate revenues from 
refreshment sales. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials agreed to consider borrowing money to finance the track and 
possibly the snack bar, but they said the district must be cautious about 
taking on additional loans for the new school. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district is already borrowing $6.2 million to help pay for 
construction of the school, including $1.2 million for a football stadium and 
swimming pool. MAIA DAVIS

EFFORTS TO SAVE CANINE QUAKE VICTIM FAIL; AFTERMATH: DESPITE BEING AIRLIFTED 
FOR DIALYSIS AT UC DAVIS, BIMBO THE GERMAN SHEPHERD DIES AFTER BEING SEVERELY 
BURNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The top-of-the-line treatment she got failed to save Bimbo. 
</P>
<P>
 Bimbo was the Simi Valley German shepherd severely burned when her master's 
truck was enveloped in a fireball from a ruptured natural gas line in Granada 
Hills shortly after the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite being airlifted to UC Davis for dialysis -- which she needed because 
burns over 50% of her body caused kidney failure -- and an offer of skin grafts 
at the prestigious Sherman Oaks Hospital burn center, Bimbo died Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterinarians at UC Davis, which has the state's only facility for dog 
dialysis, said the 2-year-old dog's condition began to deteriorate late Friday, 
prompting them to begin treatment Saturday afternoon. She improved briefly the 
next morning, but her heart failed at 12:30 p.m., they said. 
</P>
<P>
 A university news release said she probably died of a blood clotting disorder 
common to burn patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave it the college try," said Dr. A. Robert Grossman, head of the Sherman 
Oaks Hospital's burn ward, who helped coordinate the dog's care and had offered 
to perform free skin grafts on Bimbo. "I don't know if we would have had any 
better chances with a human." 
</P>
<P>
 Bimbo and another dog, Shep, were riding in the bed of a pickup truck driven 
by their master, Jim Menzi, a Simi Valley mechanic, a few hours after the 
quake. The truck stalled in a cloud of gas from the broken main under Rinaldi 
Street and Balboa Boulevard, and when he tried to restart the engine, flames 
engulfed him and the two dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Shep was killed, but the badly burned Menzi and Bimbo leaped into a pool of 
water escaping from a broken fire hydrant. Menzi, who was trying to get to 
Santa Clarita to check on his mother, continued on foot. Bimbo turned up at a 
shelter for earthquake victims, where Menzi's name and phone number were found 
on her collar. 
</P>
<P>
 Menzi was hospitalized for several days after the accident with burns over 30% 
of his body but was released a few weeks ago.

DONATIONS POUR IN TO FILLMORE FROM INDIANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a gesture of goodwill that brought tears to the eyes of disaster workers, 
Indiana firefighters Monday delivered 35 tons of earthquake relief supplies to 
the hard-hit town of Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of Indianapolis poured out their hearts," Fillmore Fire Chief Pat 
Askren said. "It renews your faith in people." 
</P>
<P>
 Askren said Capt. Randy Frye and Chief Warren White of the Marion County Fire 
Chief's Assn. in Indiana called him after the Jan. 17 earthquake and asked how 
their department might help the residents of Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations poured in to 30 Indianapolis-area fire stations when the word went 
out. Indianapolis-based Mayflower Transit Inc. donated two 18-wheelers to haul 
the goods, which included a load of food donated by Marsh Supermarkets, also of 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 The cargo of food, diapers, baby formula and other supplies arrived Monday 
morning at St. Francis of Assisi Church in Fillmore, just as relief workers had 
run short of such staples, Askren said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Volunteers had tears in their eyes and people were waiting in line as the 
goods were unloaded," Askren said. "One woman who had a baby in her arms said 
she had no diapers left. It made her day." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Indiana, Assistant Fire Chief Rick Batza of the Washington Township Fire 
Department said Indianapolis residents responded positively to the plea for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your community needed the help this time, but next time it could very well be 
us," Batza said. 
</P>
<P>
 In related news, federal emergency workers announced that disaster application 
centers in Simi Valley and Glendale will close at 7 p.m. Wednesday because of 
decreasing activity. A third disaster center at Calabasas High School will 
close at 7 p.m. Saturday.

2 YOUTHS CHARGED IN SHOOTINGS; CRIME: THEY ARE THE THIRD AND FOURTH ACCUSED IN 
THE WOUNDING OF TWO WESTLAKE HIGH STUDENTS. TWO LATEST DEFENDANTS LIVE OUTSIDE 
VENTURA COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ventura County prosecutors Monday charged an Orange County teen-ager with 
shooting two Westlake High School students in a brawl near the campus two weeks 
ago, authorities said. They also charged a Los Angeles County teen-ager as an 
accomplice in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The two youths are the third and fourth 16-year-olds charged in the case, 
which shocked Thousand Oaks. Last week, two Westlake High School students were 
charged in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges against all four boys stem from a brawl that erupted earlier this 
month when one of the defendants and a school football player met for a 
fistfight at North Ranch Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants and others jumped out of a car and announced, "We're the Asian 
Mafia," police and witnesses say. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants -- all Asian Americans -- then attacked students with bats and 
lumber before shooting into the crowd, investigators said. Three students were 
shot, and others were beaten. All of the injured students have been released 
from local hospitals, including one who suffered a minor skull fracture caused 
by a bullet that lodged in his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. John A. Cardoza said his office will file a petition asking 
that the two teen-agers charged Monday be tried as adults. He has already filed 
a similar motion for the two Ventura County youths. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants from Orange and Los Angeles counties are being held in Juvenile 
Hall and are scheduled to be arraigned in Juvenile Court this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoza said no other arrests are imminent, but that the police investigation 
into the incident is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 He credited Ventura County sheriff's authorities for tracking down leads in 
the case in three counties and swiftly arresting the four suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sheriff's office did a heck of a job putting a lot of information 
together in a short period of time," Cardoza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have said the Asian Mafia is believed to be the name of the Los 
Angeles County gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement sources said Monday, however, that none of the four boys 
charged in the melee is believed to be an active gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoza said the Orange County youth, who is from Brea, shot two of the 
students. He is charged with two counts of assault with a firearm, including 
special allegations that he caused great bodily injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County youth, from Rowland Heights, is charged with two counts 
of assault with a firearm and one count of assault with a deadly weapon.

CLAYMAN IN RUNNING FOR L.A. COUNTY POST; GOVERNMENT: THE VENTURA COUNTY 
OFFICIAL JOINS 4 OTHER CANDIDATES VYING FOR CHIEF OF THE NATION'S LARGEST 
PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 After 10 years at his post, Ventura County Public Defender Kenneth I. Clayman 
disclosed Monday that he is one of five top candidates for the job of Los 
Angeles County public defender. 
</P>
<P>
 The job, with an annual salary range of $99,873 to $149,809, became vacant in 
September with the retirement of Los Angeles County Public Defender Wilbur 
Littlefield. Littlefield had spent 36 years at the largest and oldest public 
defender's office in the United States, the last 17 as its head. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayman, 52, of Camarillo said he loves his work overseeing Ventura County's 
37 public defense attorneys. But he could not pass up a chance to direct the 
nearly 600 attorneys in the Los Angeles County public defender's office who 
represent "the innocent, the downtrodden and even the despicable." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a wonderful job now," said Clayman, who earns a base salary of 
$99,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the Los Angeles office happens to be the largest in the country. There 
are enormous challenges in running it, and when a person makes a career as I 
have out of public defendering . . . of course I want to look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clayman is no stranger to the Los Angeles County public defender's office. He 
worked there for 17 years before the Ventura County Board of Supervisors 
appointed him to his current job in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a trial deputy in Los Angeles for the first 10 years, then won 
promotions to become chief of the juvenile division in 1977 and head of the 
municipal court division in 1981, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he is competing against four other candidates, three of whom have ties to 
the Los Angeles County public defender's office. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The other candidates are Michael P. Judge, 49, a veteran public defender in 
the office; David Meyer, 50, the acting public defender in that office; Mark E. 
Overland, 53, a former deputy public defender in that office and now partner in 
the Santa Monica law firm of Overland & Gits; and Fresno County Public Defender 
Jose R. Villarreal, 49. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors will interview each of the five 
before appointing the new public defender, said Shigeki Kikkawa, executive 
recruiter for the county's chief administrative officer. The interview schedule 
has not been set, Kikkawa said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Public Defender's Office employs a total of 854 
attorneys and other staff and has an annual budget that this year reached $71.4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The job is "the plum job of public defender jobs," said Ventura County 
Assistant Public Defender Duane Dammeyer, who oversees felony cases for 
Clayman. 
</P>
<P>
 Dammeyer said Clayman is an open-minded administrator who "is not looking to 
surround himself with yes men" and has modernized the Ventura County public 
defender's office in his 10 years there. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayman's strengths as a bureaucrat would also suit him well in dealing with 
the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, Dammeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know much about what goes on down there," he said. "But here he takes 
great pains in making sure the members of the board (of supervisors) are 
informed as to exactly what our needs are, what our strengths are and that the 
law mandates that we have service at a certain level." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said his office and Clayman's 
have worked well together. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that I like most, of course, is he works so well with the other 
justice agencies," Bradbury said. "If there's any concern, he picks up the 
phone and calls me, and I'm comfortable doing the same with him. We've been 
able to work together for the betterment of the justice system here."

ARGUMENTS FROM AHMANSON CRITICS TO BE HEARD TODAY; COURTS: THE PLAINTIFFS ARE 
SEEKING TO OVERTURN VENTURA COUNTY'S 1992 APPROVAL OF THE PROJECT NEAR SIMI 
VALLEY. A KEY ISSUE INVOLVES PARKLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Opponents of the $1-billion Ahmanson Ranch project -- which would create a 
mini-city in the rolling hills south of Simi Valley -- will get their day in 
court today. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Superior Court Judge Barbara Lane will hear oral arguments on 
nine lawsuits filed by Los Angeles County and the cities of Los Angeles, 
Calabasas, Malibu, and several environmental and homeowner groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs are seeking to overturn Ventura County's 1992 approval of the 
project, arguing that the development would cause enormous environmental 
damage, snarl traffic and strain public services in the neighboring 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the central issues in the case is whether 10,000 acres of dedicated 
parkland included in the Ahmanson deal outweigh the project's environmental 
impacts. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't know how much it's going to cost the city of Los Angeles to 
mitigate all of the traffic impacts, then how can you say the parkland is an 
overriding consideration?" said attorney Rosemary Woodblock, who is 
representing the environmental group Save Open Space. "You have to know 
specifically what you're overriding." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, said that whatever the outcome, the case will probably be 
appealed. The conservancy hopes to acquire thousands of acres of parkland in 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless there is some kind of side agreement in the appellate process, it 
could end up in the California Supreme Court," Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Supervisors approved the 3,050-dwelling golf 
course community near the Los Angeles County line on the condition that 
Ahmanson Land Co. and its partners turn over to state and federal park agencies 
10,000 acres of mountain land, much of it owned by entertainer Bob Hope. So 
far, only about 3,000 acres -- including Hope's 2,308-acre Jordan Ranch -- have 
been acquired as public parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson expects to donate another 2,633 acres, and it must still deliver two 
other Hope properties -- the 4,369-acre Runkle Ranch northwest of Chatsworth 
and the 339-acre Corral Canyon tract in Malibu -- to complete the deal. Under 
its agreement with the county, the developer has about two years remaining to 
acquire Hope's land if it wants to go forward with its development. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson, concerned how its profit margin from the planned development will be 
affected by the lawsuits, has put its plans on hold until the case is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston said he is concerned that the lawsuits may prompt Ahmanson to try to 
back out of its original development-for-parkland deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty years from now, nobody will give a damn if there are another 500 or 
1,000 extra cars" on the Ventura Freeway and surrounding surface streets, he 
said. "But they will care if we lose this opportunity to gain thousands of 
acres of parkland." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria K. VanderKolk, the county official closest to the deal, said 
she is confident that the judge will find that the environmental impact report 
on the planned development meets all state and county regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think she will rescind" the board's approval of the report, 
VanderKolk said. "It's certainly possible, but I don't think very likely." 
</P>
<P>
 If the judge finds no major problems with the report, VanderKolk said she 
believes that the Ahmanson project will go forward as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 But should there be any drastic changes to the Ahmanson development resulting 
from the court's ruling, "then the entire economic plan and development of the 
project will be completely blown away and we'll have to start all over again," 
she said.

JURORS TOLD TO USE BACK DOOR AT MURDER TRIAL; COURTS: THE JUDGE'S ORDER OCCURS 
AFTER HE RECEIVES THE THIRD COMPLAINT ABOUT THE DEFENDANT'S FAMILY MAKING 
CONTACT WITH THE PANEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A Ventura County judge Monday instructed jurors in a death-penalty case to 
come and go from the courtroom through a back door because of continuing 
complaints that the defendant's family has become too friendly with them. 
</P>
<P>
 The order came after Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch received his third 
complaint in less than a week about defendant Christopher James Sattiewhite's 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-week-old Sattiewhite trial is expected to go to the jury today. 
Sattiewhite is charged with murder, kidnaping and rape in connection with the 
Jan. 26, 1992, slaying of 30-year-old Genoveva Gonzales, the mother of four 
small children. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors filed a motion Monday claiming that a court reporter had witnessed 
family members talking about the case in the presence of the jury on at least 
six occasions in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 During one hallway incident, four family members were seen "forming a U" 
around one juror, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really don't know what conversations took place between the family and the 
juror," Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn told the judge. "They may have 
discussed evidence that was introduced outside the presence of the jury." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The other complaints about family contact with the jury came last week. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 8, Storch refused to admonish a juror who held Sattiewhite's 
2-month-old niece during a break in the trial. The judge said he "would appeal 
to everybody's sense of fair play" -- urging the relatives to do their best to 
avoid bringing the baby into further contact with jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 And Thursday, the bailiff reported to the judge that a family member had 
discussed the case in the presence of the jury during another break outside the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Storch again asked the family member in question to be "fair-minded" and try 
not to influence the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn, however, asked the judge Monday to do more than ask for cooperation. He 
encouraged the judge to question the juror who held the baby and the one who 
was surrounded by the family. 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn called the family members' actions "ongoing and prejudicial." Family 
members have denied talking about the case in the presence of the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Sattiewhite's attorney, Willard P. Wiksell, said whatever had transpired 
between the family and jury was out of his control. Earlier, Wiksell had asked 
Storch not to admonish the jurors, saying it might reflect badly on their 
opinion of his client. 
</P>
<P>
 Storch did not broach the subject with jurors when they first entered the 
courtroom Monday morning. But after testimony for the morning was completed, he 
told the jurors that they no longer would be allowed access to the public 
hallways in front of the fourth-floor courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He told them that they are to enter and leave from the courtroom through the 
back door and take their breaks in the jury-deliberation room. Normally, jurors 
do not make use of that room until after they are ready to deliberate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's unfortunate that jurors come in contact with witnesses and 
family members," Storch said. "I think what the court has done this morning -- 
using the jury-deliberation room as a lounge -- in retrospect should have been 
done from the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Storch on Monday also interviewed the juror who held the baby and the one who 
was crowded by the family. Both said their objectivity had not been 
compromised, and they were allowed to remain on the panel.

SUPERVISORS CAVING IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I can remember the "good old days" when Hoot Bennett, John Conlan, Tom 
Laubacher, Frank Jewett and a few others -- who didn't depend upon a county 
paycheck for their livelihood -- used to make decisions based on what was good 
for the majority of people living in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few years, it seems as if the majority of our Board of Supervisors 
has caved in to the Ojai squeaky wheels on more issues than I care to remember, 
starting with Petrochem (ensuring the demise of the local oil industry), the 
Sespe Creek study, Taylor Ranch college site, Weldon Canyon Landfill and now 
the state-of-the-art Doppler radar that is very much needed to predict weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Personal political best interest and perpetuation of incumbency are in charge 
of county government policy. 
</P>
<P>
 It is way past time for term limits.

BEACH GROIN DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for your coverage of the Greenock groin and Surfrider Foundation's 
concerns about Ventura's plan to build a 100-foot addition onto the existing 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
 We'd like to point out that Surfrider Foundation, Ventura County chapter, has 
never categorically opposed the project.There are two phases to the project, 
and we strongly support Phase 1, which is the reconstruction and reinforcement 
of the existing groin. By doing so, we believe that beach erosion could be 
halted, homes in the area could be protected and currents at Marina Park would 
be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 The second phase, the construction of an offset T-shaped cap on the existing 
groin, is the portion of the project that we question. We have, from the 
beginning, proposed that Phase 1 be carried out and the city then pause to 
assess the impact of reinforcing the groin. If beach erosion would be halted by 
phase one construction, there would be no need to carry out Phase 2, a surfing 
spot could be protected and the city would save money. 
</P>
<P>
 We were informed three years ago that this was an "all or nothing" project. 
Therefore, out of concern for homeowners, we chose not to object to the 
project. Our Paddle Out demonstration was to educate the public as to the 
importance of preserving surf spots and to encourage planning agencies to take 
a conservative, step-by-step approach to any future projects that affect ocean 
and beach use.

NAVY TERM FOR 'KILLING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, the Navy and government officials have come up with another 
politically correct word for killing things. 
</P>
<P>
 I refer to the Article of Feb. 2 on the OK for the Navy to detonate thousands 
of pounds of explosives off the Channel Islands. Their new word for killing 
whales and other federally protected species is incidental take.  
</P>
<P>
 During the ex-President George Bush-sponsored war in Iraq, the word for 
killing innocent civilians was collateral damage . Why can't the Navy just say 
they are going to kill things?

DO THE RIGHT THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was greatly disturbed to read in the L. A. Times (Jan. 28, Ventura County) 
that the majority of the Civic Arts Commission had blatantly recommended an 
oversized marquee for the Civic Arts Plaza in direct violation of Thousand 
Oaks' sign code. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons my wife and I moved to Thousand Oaks were the same as many 
others': the country atmosphere and the well thought-out plans for the orderly 
development of the city by far-sighted people.If I had wanted to live in a city 
atmosphere surrounded by tall storage buildings and flashing electronic signs, 
I would have moved to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems we were wrong. Building codes appear meaningless, and it appears that 
waivers are the rule rather than the exception. The Times stated that 
Commissioner Virginia Davis said, "The City Council has already waived a 
handful of municipal codes for the Civic Arts Plaza and other public buildings, 
such as the teen and senior center and the main library." 
</P>
<P>
 Why not do away with all codes since no one appears to be following them? Or 
are the codes only for the "little people" and not for the "chosen few?"

 My faith in human nature was restored when I read that one commissioner, Larry 
Sparrow, had the courage and integrity to do the right thing and oppose the 
oversized marquee. I applaud Sparrow for his stand and would strongly suggest 
Sparrow consider running for City Council; we need more people with his 
integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 It is my sincere hope that some on the City Council will have the courage and 
integrity to follow Sparrow's lead and do the right thing.

BROWN WATER NAVY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We are approaching the second anniversary of the birth of the Ventura Brown 
Water Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, it is going unheralded. Not a ruffle, not a flourish or drum roll for 
the only event to focus every major TV network and news magazine on our little 
town.Where is our sense of history, our civic pride for the February deluge of 
'92 that spotlighted the oldest permanent established floating RV park in 
California? 
</P>
<P>
 Where else will you find amphibious motor homes? America's eyes were riveted, 
by thunder. The clarion call was bugled nationwide; "Developers. Park your 
cellular Benz's here. Our City Council is user-friendly. If we can issue 
building permits for housing in a riverbed, think of what we can do with 
beaches at low tide." Hey, we talk trickle-down economics at flood stage. Never 
mind how much it costs to protect and save a submersible suburb. We have 
taxpayers for that. 
</P>
<P>
 And a new warning system for the next major storm. First alert will be: "It is 
raining." Second warning: "Be patient; helicopters are on the way." Third 
announcement: "The Ventura Chamber of Commerce disavows all knowledge of this 
project."

NWS RADAR DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am really tired of hearing and reading about the hypocritical elitists of 
the Ojai area. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is the National Weather Service radar installation on Sulphur 
Mountain.These individuals complaining about the installation most likely 
receive far more radiation exposure from their television sets (probably big 
screen TVs) and natural background radiation than what they would ever receive 
from the NWS radar tower. 
</P>
<P>
 What is more ridiculous is that our Board of Supervisors is placating these 
individuals. The board is asking that this facility be moved to an unpopulated 
area. Politically, it would seem to be the right thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same theme, the supervisors will be considering extension of the 
Bailard Landfill. The Bailard Landfill will have a far greater environmental 
impact on the population of Oxnard and Ventura than the NWS radar perceived 
impact on Ojai. If we take the board position on the NWS installation, it would 
appear that the board will request that the Bailard Landfill extension be 
denied and moved to an unpopulated area of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more pressing issues that the board should be spending time on. This 
is not one of them.

LOOKING TO COMPUTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With computer capabilities, it would be possible to produce through cross 
reference of payrolls and their employee data, an introduction service to 
people who would like to share rides to and from work. 
</P>
<P>
 Through this cross-reference process, computers could print out the names of 
people, their addresses and phone numbers of those working in the same ZIP 
codes and living in the same ZIP codes. 
</P>
<P>
 This introduction service matchup would then enable people to team up and 
share rides, thereby helping to relieve the crisis caused by the earthquake.

GAMES IN GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your report on partially hidden or disguised remunerations provided senior 
county employees by a very generous Board of Supervisors trumpets the old saw, 
"To him who has shall be given; from him who has not will be taken away." 
</P>
<P>
 Writing as one of the peasants without the advantages of a county job, I 
deplore the creative game playing of the Office of Personnel and the Board of 
Supervisors.The former spends many highly paid hours dreaming up new forms of 
benefits for county leaders, and a majority of the board unctuously votes the 
requests for civil servants and the thank-you bonuses for the supervisors -- 
with John Flynn invariably objecting, it should be noted. 
</P>
<P>
 The deterioration of morality in our nation is nowhere more obvious than in 
the preoccupation of many rulers with getting what they can from the public 
purse. The fact that private associations within our society tirelessly 
manipulate their constituents to pressure government to collect goodies for 
themselves highlights the cancerous greed in our humanity without excusing the 
various treasury raids by coalitions of senior bureaucrats and elected 
controllers of public money.

RECALL THE BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for exposing the amount of hard-earned money going to a group of 
county officials who are stuffing their pockets with money that we so badly 
need in this county for schools, libraries, welfare and low-cost housing 
("County Officials' Benefits Top $300,000," Feb. 6). 
</P>
<P>
 It's obscene to say the least. I think they should all be recalled with the 
exception of Vicky Howard and John Flynn, who seem to have some sensibility to 
be aware of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 If some of these people were out of work and had to find a job in the private 
sector, they would have a hard time earning $25,000 a year.

ALL-OUT TRADE WAR NOT IN THE CARDS; MARKETS: THE DOLLAR PLUNGES TO SIX-MONTH 
LOW AGAINST THE YEN, SENDING THE NIKKEI STOCK AVERAGE INTO A TAILSPIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dollar plunged to nearly six-month lows against the Japanese yen in U.S. 
trading Monday as investors feared that the Clinton Administration would drive 
the dollar lower against the yen in retaliation for the breakdown of trade 
talks intended to ease the nearly $60-billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The strengthening yen and the threat of U.S. trade sanctions continued to send 
Japanese shares spiraling downward. In early trading today, the Nikkei 
225-share average was down 647.47 points to 18,811.78. On Monday, the Nikkei 
closed off 531.45 at 19,459.25. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong yen tends to spur U.S. exports to Japan by making them less costly, 
while raising the price of Japanese products in the United States. The strategy 
has been used in the past as a way to correct the huge Japanese trade surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, blue-chip stocks settled with modest gains after a rise in 
long-term interest rates cut into the market's initial advance of more than 20 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar started skidding against the yen in early trading in Tokyo, 
although the Japanese central bank bought dollars to support the U.S. currency, 
according to Amy Smith, senior currency strategist at the IDEA analysts 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed in New York at 102.65 Japanese yen, down from 107.20 yen 
Friday. At one point in New York trading, the greenback fell to an intraday low 
of 101.00 yen, a level not seen since Aug. 17, the day the dollar hit a 
post-World II low of 100.40 yen. 
</P>
<P>
 But dealers said they see the dollar testing that level soon because the 
Clinton Administration has shown no sign it is unhappy with the dollar's fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar has dropped 6% since President Clinton announced last Friday that 
top-level U.S.-Japan trade talks had ended without an agreement, setting the 
stage for possible U.S. trade retaliation against Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the President refused to rule out a possible all-out trade war with 
Japan, although he said he would take "some days" to mull the full range of 
options before imposing sanctions on Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite denials by U.S. officials that the White House has plans for a 
campaign to promote a stronger yen, many traders interpreted Clinton's 
statements as indicating such tactics would be used. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 Stocks ended mixed in choppy trading as investors also worried about a trade 
war between Japan and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones average rose 9.28 points to 3,904.06, and advancing issues 
narrowly outnumbered declines on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 But the NYSE's composite index lost 0.05 to 261.26, while at the American 
Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 2.32 to 474.91. Among other major 
market indicators, the Nasdaq composite index rose 4.06 to 785.45. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Board volume came to a moderate 263.19 million shares, up from 213.74 
million in the previous session, which was cut short by Friday's severe winter 
storm in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks swung between positive and negative territory, with an early sharp 
advance of more than 25 points evaporating as the dollar's decline intensified 
and as bond yields turned decidedly higher, pushing down prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks ended mostly lower in Europe. In London, the Financial Times 100-share 
average ended down 15.4 points at 3,363.5, while Frankfurt's DAX-30 average 
closed at 2,116.01, up 1.21% or 25.4 points. Stocks also fell in Paris and 
Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index closed 23.23 points lower at 2,778.83. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * QVC Network gained 1 5/8 to 48 1/2 amid speculation that rival Viacom had 
won the protracted bidding war for Paramount Communications. Viacom class A 
fell 1 5/8 to 34 7/8, and Viacom class B dropped 1 3/4 to 29 7/8. Paramount 
closed down 3/4 to 76 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among gainers, General Motors rose 5/8 to 61 3/4, Chrysler added 3/4 to 59 
3/4 and Ford Motor was up 1/4 to 65 3/4. The auto makers rebounded from a bout 
of profit taking last week. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other strong cyclicals were Whirlpool, which rose 2 1/2 to 70 1/2, and 
Caterpillar, up 7/8 to 106. 
</P>
<P>
 * Compaq Computer gained 7/8 to 91 5/8, and IBM ended up 3/4 to 54. 
</P>
<P>
 * Summit Technology fell 4 3/4 to 31 3/4 after CNBC commentator Dan Dorfman 
made negative comments about the company's Excimer laser system for the 
treatment of nearsightedness. 
</P>
<P>
 * Columbia/HCA Healthcare gained 1 1/8 to 39 3/4. Columbia Healthcare and HCA 
-- Hospital Corp. of America -- completed their merger last week. 
</P>
<P>
 * WMX Technologies gained 1/8 to 24 7/8 after prosecutors in California said 
they wouldn't appeal a decision last week dismissing theft charges against a 
WMX Technologies unit and eight employees. Credit  
</P>
<P>
 Long-term Treasury bond yields rose on fears that the dollar's plunge against 
the Japanese yen would prompt foreign investors to sell U.S. bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The long bond's yield rose to 6.45% from 6.40% on Friday. Its price, which 
moves in the opposite direction, fell 9/16 point, or $5.63 per $1,000 in face 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 But prices of shorter-term maturities barely budged. Short-term Treasuries 
ranged from unchanged to 1/32 point higher, while intermediate maturities were 
unchanged to 1/8 point lower, the Telerate Inc. financial information service 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospects for a weakening dollar sparked fears that Japanese investors would 
dump dollar-denominated securities to cut exchange rate losses, prompting a 
selloff in bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Fears of a selloff by overseas investors spread as the dollar slid against the 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, when that happens, a lot of investors get scared and bail out of 
Treasuries," said Anthony Chan, an economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd 
Government Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said there was little indication that Japanese investors were selling 
off their holdings of Treasury securities. But many U.S. traders sold in 
anticipation of that scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 A report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on regional economic 
conditions also prompted some bond selling, Chan said. The survey showed a 
surge in production by manufacturers who expected to raise prices in January. 
</P>
<P>
 While regional in scope, the report was viewed as an indicator of national 
business conditions and may have focused attention on the timing of the Federal 
Reserve's next move to raise short-term interest rates, Chan said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 Gold for current delivery closed at $383.90 an ounce on the New York Comex, up 
$3.90 from Monday, while silver for current delivery closed at $5.343 an ounce, 
up 9.5 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, warming sunshine spread from the East Coast to the Midwest Monday, 
pushed March crude oil down 59 cents to a seven-week low of $14.13 a barrel.

GETTING INVOLVED: KIDSCAN TURNS TRASH INTO SCHOOL CASH

 On Wednesdays, the lines of students at the playground at Washington 
Elementary School in Burbank don't lead to the swing set or the seesaw. The 
children wait instead to dump their families' and neighbors' empty aluminum 
cans and plastic bottles into four garbage cans set around the yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank students are participants in a new program meant to turn cans into 
cash for computers and other equipment for schools in Los Angeles, Orange, 
Riverside and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is a joint venture of a Los Angeles-based organization called 
Technology for Results in Elementary Education (TREE) and the firm 
Environmental Products Co. of Fairfax, Va., which manufactures automatic 
recycling machines. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the month, 26 schools in the four counties are expected to be 
participating in KidsCan, including the 18 now active in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of computers, Washington Elementary, one of the first to join, plans 
to use its recycling money to buy seeds, soil and spades for its new 
environmental garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's absolutely wonderful to reinforce the idea of recycling," said 
teacher Megan Farnsworth, student council adviser, who heads the school's 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers are needed throughout the program to help at schools, do 
administrative work from their homes and transport containers to recycling 
centers, said Dana Richdale, executive director of KidsCan. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about the program, call (800) 648-KIDS.

ANALYSIS; RAMS FACE TOUGH CHOICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Studying the NFL's free-agent market has never been an exact science for the 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 But now figure in the new salary cap of $33.8 million per team, along with the 
Rams' lack of depth and need for starters at key positions. 
</P>
<P>
 A chemistry experiment just waiting to explode, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have 35 players under contract for $21.8 million, not counting the 
seven restricted free agents on their roster that they have yet to re-sign. 
Depending on which players it keeps, the team could have between $8 million and 
$12 million left to spend on free agents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will need to stretch every dollar because their needs lie at some 
pretty high-priced positions -- quarterback, wide receiver, defensive back, 
defensive tackle and offensive line. With the cap, it could be a buyer's 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 There's talent out there, but the smart shoppers will have to buy early. 
Because of the cap, teams will be snapping up veterans in the first few weeks 
of the free-agent signing period, which begins Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Can the Rams compete? 
</P>
<P>
 A look at what they could do, should do, and probably will do: QUARTERBACK 
</P>
<P>
 Situation: Here's a hint: Quarterback Jim Everett's Orange Park Acres house is 
up for sale. Don't look for T.J. Rubley to be moving in. Everett's on the way 
out and the coaching staff learned that Rubley wasn't the answer when he 
struggled in seven starts last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Conventional wisdom tells the Rams, who pick fifth in the April 24-25 draft, 
to trade up for Cincinnati's top pick or Indianapolis' second selection, and 
take one of the top quarterback prospects -- Tennessee's Heath Shuler and 
Fresno State's Trent Dilfer. But Coach Chuck Knox turns 62 in April, has two 
years left on his contract and may not have the time and patience to develop a 
rookie quarterback. Besides, the Rams want to win now , so an experienced 
quarterback is a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's available: Slim pickings. Detroit's trio of Erik Kramer, Rodney Peete 
and Andre Ware are unrestricted, as well as Dallas' Bernie Kosar, Atlanta's 
Chris Miller and Miami's Scott Mitchell. But Kosar is immobile and throws 
sidearm, Miller is a walking body cast and Mitchell was impressive, 
unimpressive and injured at different times throughout the season. Kramer is 
the best of the Detroit trio. 
</P>
<P>
 Wish list: Remember Dave Krieg, Joe Montana's caddie in Kansas City last 
season? Krieg is unrestricted, played nine seasons for Knox in Seattle and is 
interested in becoming a starter again. He made $1.9 million last year with the 
Chiefs, so the price could be right if the Rams unload Everett's $2.5-million 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade possibilities: Jeff George is unhappy in Indianapolis and could wind up 
in Atlanta. Houston has salary cap problems and will be looking to unload an 
aging Warren Moon or backup Cody Carlson, who earned a combined $6.25 million 
last season. Will Moon, a native of Los Angeles, return home? Not likely. He's 
37 and made $3.25 million last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Who you'll see in Anaheim Stadium next fall: Krieg is 33 . . . and he isn't 
the answer. WIDE RECEIVER 
</P>
<P>
 Situation: The Rams are in desperate need of a wide receiver with speed, 
big-play capabilities and the courage to cross the middle of the secondary. 
(See J.J. Stokes, who's back for his senior year at UCLA). Henry Ellard is 32, 
unrestricted and would likely have to take a big pay cut to stay with the Rams. 
Flipper Anderson, the team's deep threat, had only one touchdown catch in the 
final 10 games last season. Todd Kinchen has undergone knee surgery twice in 
the last nine months, and Ernie Jones busted a finger while dropping a pass in 
the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's available: There's a decent corps of unrestricted free agents in the 
Raiders' Tim Brown, San Diego's Anthony Miller, Minnesota's Anthony Carter, 
Atlanta's Michael Haynes and Houston's Haywood Jeffires and Webster Slaughter. 
The draft has a handful of first-round picks, including Colorado's Charles 
Johnson and USC's Johnnie Morton, but none merit spending a top-five pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Wish list: The Raiders will probably re-sign Brown, and don't look for 
Jeffires and Slaughter to be too excited about playing in the Rams' rushing 
offense. Haynes reportedly wants to stay in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Who you'll see in Anaheim Stadium next fall: Take a guess. DEFENSIVE BACKFIELD 
</P>
<P>
 Situation: When the Rams lost cornerbacks Todd Lyght and Robert Bailey to knee 
injuries, they brought in four cornerbacks off the street in an attempt to fill 
a glaring lack of depth -- Dexter Davis, Wymon Henderson, Sam Seale and 
Mitchell Price. So signing two cornerbacks -- either through free-agency or the 
draft -- is a must. And if the Rams don't re-sign Michael Stewart or Pat 
Terrell, they also will be in the market for a strong safety. Free safety 
Anthony Newman signed a two-year deal in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's available: Buffalo cornerback Nate Odomes, Mark Collins of the New York 
Giants and Houston's Cris Dishman are unrestricted. 
</P>
<P>
 Wish list: Odomes had nine interceptions, tied for the league lead with 
Seattle safety Eugene Robinson. Collins is a former Cal State Fullerton 
standout. 
</P>
<P>
 Who you'll see in Anaheim Stadium next fall: If the Rams somehow work out 
their quarterback problems through free agency, they could take Alabama's 
Antonio Langham, considered a can't-miss prospect, with the fifth pick. Collins 
would start if he signs. OFFENSIVE LINE 
</P>
<P>
 Situation: See defensive backs. No depth. The Rams had to go with Jeff Pahukoa 
and Keith Loneker at left guard when starter Tom Newberry missed the last seven 
games with a knee injury. Darryl Ashmore did a decent job in place of right 
tackle Jackie Slater, who missed seven of the final eight games with a torn 
pectoral muscle. The Rams can't afford to lose long-snapper Blair Bush and 
Slater, both unrestricted. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's available: Dallas' top three guards -- Nate Newton, Kevin Gogan and John 
Gesek -- are unrestricted, as well as Kansas City tackle John Alt, Buffalo 
tackle Howard Ballard, Kansas City guard-tackle Ricky Siglar and San Francisco 
guard Guy McIntyre and New England tackle Bruce Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Wish list: Any of the Dallas linemen. Dallas quarterbacks were sacked only 29 
times last season, the seventh-lowest total in the league. Newton is a two-time 
Pro Bowl selection and Gesek can play center, guard or tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 Who you'll see in Anaheim Stadium next fall: The jury is still out, but 
pursuing one of the Dallas linemen would be the best bet. DEFENSIVE TACKLE 
</P>
<P>
 Situation: The Rams need to sign a strong tackle to take some of the heat off 
Pro Bowl tackle Sean Gilbert, who saw more than his share of double-teaming 
last season. They also must re-sign defensive end Tony Woods, who came on 
strong late in the season. Defensive end Robert Young also must fully recover 
from knee surgery to give the Rams a good pass rush next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's available: Dallas' Jimmie Jones, Philadelphia's William Perry and 
Minnesota's Henry Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Wish list: Jones, an underachiever who didn't start for the Cowboys, made 
$800,000 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Who you'll see in Anaheim Stadium next fall: Jones might factor in the Rams' 
plans. SPECIAL TEAMS 
</P>
<P>
 Situation: A disaster. The team's lack of speed and depth was painfully 
evident on punt and kick coverage last season. Kinchen, their top punt 
returner, blew out his knee and was replaced by an aging Ellard, who was booed 
in the final home game for taking fair catches on punts that might have been 
returned. The Rams must re-sign punter Sean Landeta, on whom they maintain 
right of first refusal. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's available: Buffalo's Steve Tasker is considered one of the league's best 
coverage men. And he's not a bad kick returner, as the Raiders discovered in 
the playoffs. Detroit's Mel Gray was fifth in the NFC in punt returns (8.6 
yards) and fourth in kickoff returns (24.6). 
</P>
<P>
 Wish list: Tasker and Gray. 
</P>
<P>
 Who you'll see in Anaheim Stadium next fall: Neither. Tasker will be looking 
to double his $500,000 annual salary. Gray turns 33 on March 16. Look for the 
Rams to try and pick up speed in the middle rounds of the draft, if there's any 
speed left. Ram Free Agents

COMMENTARY; IT'S TIME TO TOAST MATADORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By rights, Cal State Northridge's 3,000-seat gymnasium should be filled 
tonight, the fans packed like sardines all the way up to the creaky old 
rafters. 
</P>
<P>
 If ever a college basketball team deserved a hero's welcome, the Matadors are 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Northridge is not returning home after rising from the depths of the 
sport's computer ratings to slay a top-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it has accomplished much more. The Matadors have shown themselves, 
and their campus community, a will to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge is not among the best basketball teams, but the Matadors have 
proved themselves a unit to be admired. 
</P>
<P>
 Team Tragedy lives. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 17, the date the Northridge campus was near the epicenter of a 6.8 
earthquake, the Matadors were in Boulder, Colo., preparing for a basketball 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have said that they were fortunate being away. The consensus among 
players is the opposite. Theirs was a feeling of helplessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Between frantic attempts to reach family and friends by telephone, Northridge 
players watched television news reports and tried to console one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, that evening, they went out and played spirited basketball before 
faltering at the end of a 100-85 loss against Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials urged the team to finish the trip by staying in Colorado to 
play Air Force two days later in Colorado Springs. Coach Pete Cassidy, with the 
unanimous backing of his players, chose to return home. 
</P>
<P>
 What the players found, in many cases, were ruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Micelli and Chris Yard were considered the lucky ones. The home they 
share with two friends sustained only minor damage. It quickly became a 
sanctuary for several displaced Northridge athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 19, Nicholas Micelli, Peter's father, stopped at the house to deliver 
water and other needed supplies. Micelli, an attorney and a staunch supporter 
of the Northridge basketball team, was on his way to the Bay Area to work on a 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the last time his son would see him alive. The following day, Nick 
Micelli was found dead of an apparent heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Jolted again. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy called off practice for a week to allow his players to piece their 
lives together. Workouts resumed Jan. 25, the day after Micelli's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after that, the Matadors learned that Yard, one of the team's top 
players, had a torn knee ligament requiring major reconstructive surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Micelli and Yard, no longer the lucky ones.  
</P>
<P>
 Northridge lost when it resumed its season Jan. 29 against Northeastern 
Illinois in Chicago. Then it was on to South Bend, Ind., and Sacramento, 
reporters and camera crews following all the while. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper stories and television reports only briefly mentioned the games. 
Instead, they focused on basketball being "therapeutic" for this hearty band of 
shellshocked coaches and athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy was particularly engaging after a lopsided loss against Notre Dame. 
Faced with persistent questions about how the quake might affect recruiting, he 
launched into an animated dissertation about the odds of a natural disaster 
striking the same place twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge, he proclaimed, might indeed be the safest place on earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Matador players seemed to follow their coach's lead, calmly fielding questions 
that only a seismologist would be qualified to answer. 
</P>
<P>
 When the world shakes, basketball falls fast on the priority list. Yet 
Northridge has not embarrassed itself on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in a 30-point loss against 19th-ranked California, the Matadors played 
hard and well enough to earn smatterings of applause from an otherwise partisan 
Golden Bear crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes time for the roar. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge has not played at home in six weeks. The Matadors deserve a welcome 
befitting the class act they have become. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors, 5-16, will meet Grand Canyon (Ariz.), a 10-12 Division II team, 
tonight at 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Two mediocre basketball teams. There are other shows around town. 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympics are on television. The Lakers are playing the Clippers at the 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking is a problem because of the collapse of an almost new, supposedly 
earthquake-proof, three-tiered parking structure located next to to the 
Northridge athletic administration building. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding the gym might pose an entirely different challenge. Hundreds of 
temporary classrooms have turned Northridge into what looks like the world's 
largest trailer park. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus is a maze. 
</P>
<P>
 The wallet will have to take a $5 hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Come anyway.

LONG WAIT FINALLY OVER FOR DUCKS' LOACH; HOCKEY: LEFT WINGER LED ANAHEIM'S IHL 
TEAM WITH 32 GOALS AND 36 ASSISTS. MONDAY, HE WAS CALLED UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lonnie Loach had stopped asking why a long time ago. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no sense mulling over the Mighty Ducks' decision to send him to San 
Diego at the end of training camp in October. The past was past. What concerned 
Loach was playing well and returning to the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 "All you can do is play," Loach said. "The only way I can get anywhere is to 
play. I'd love to come up to Anaheim and play there." 
</P>
<P>
 Loach's outlook, perseverance and performance paid dividends Monday when the 
Ducks announced that they were recalling the left winger from the San Diego 
Gulls, their International Hockey League affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck General Manager Jack Ferreira saw Loach score four goals against a 
visiting Central Red Army team Saturday and made the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "He played very, very well," Ferreira said. "I was just thinking about it and 
debating it and I just decided he deserves a shot. He scored four goals and 
they were really good goals. They weren't just tap-ins, they were sniper-type 
goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Loach led the Gulls with 32 goals and 36 assists and was the IHL's 
sixth-leading scorer with 68 points. 
</P>
<P>
 His style of play -- a relentless push toward the opponent's goal -- made him 
a favorite among the San Diego Sports Arena's rowdy, beer-drinking gatherings 
of twentysomethings that swell to almost 10,000 on weekend nights. Loach's play 
kept the Gulls in the thick of the IHL's Pacific Division race until recently 
when first-place Las Vegas opened up a 10-point lead over San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 But winning and scoring goals in front of big, happy crowds only goes so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Loach couldn't help but wonder when the goal-hungry Ducks would call, 
requesting the honor of his scoring presence. 
</P>
<P>
 He knew full well that his chance for a promotion boiled down to two basic 
elements of hockey: offense and defense. His excellent offensive skills 
appeared to be in his favor. But his defense and lack of size might have held 
him back. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a goal or two is going to help them get to the playoffs, then I think I 
can help," Loach, who is generously listed at 5 feet 10, 180 pounds, said 
before his call-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Said San Diego Coach Harold Snepsts: "If you need goal scoring and, of course 
he has the speed . . . He's playing a lot better defensively than everybody 
told me he could." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense and goaltending were the cornerstones on which the Ducks were built. 
Swift skaters fond of wide-open, King-style hockey need not apply. The Ducks 
are big, often brutally physical and always determined to keep the opposition 
involved in a grinding game. 
</P>
<P>
 Loach walked into Anaheim Arena on the first day of training camp knowing 
somebody had to score goals and figured he would fit that role as well as 
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, he had made an offensive impact as a King rookie last season, 
recording 23 points (10 goals and 13 assists) in 50 games. And he led the IHL 
with 131 points as a member of the Ft. Wayne Komets in 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
 He also thought he could throw an occasional check if need be. 
</P>
<P>
 "The knock on me is that I'm soft defensively," said Loach, who was claimed 
from the Kings in the expansion draft last June. "But (the Ducks) have so many 
players in the same mold." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Ducks sent Loach to San Diego before their 7-2 opening-night loss to 
Detroit Oct. 8, he was shocked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the last thing I expected," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days that followed, Loach tried to make sense of the move but couldn't 
seem to come to grips with it. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't happen overnight, but Loach finally shook off the effects of his 
demotion. 
</P>
<P>
 He went on to lead the Gulls by example, Snepsts and defenseman Greg Brown 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at his stats," Snepsts said. "He's become a real team leader. Yeah, it 
was a blow to his ego, but I believe he's giving his best effort," 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who played 10 games with the Buffalo Sabres last season, looked to 
Loach for inspiration in tough games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every night, he puts on a show," Brown said. "He's just won games for us. 
It's very comforting when you have a guy like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Ducks, the Gulls weren't overly concerned with crashing bodies and 
low scores. If a game develops into wide-open, fire-wagon hockey, they aren't 
worried. Loach was clearly comfortable playing such a style, seemingly always 
on the lookout for a chance to break toward the other team's net. 
</P>
<P>
 When an opportunity came, he drove toward the goal, looked for a shot when he 
had the puck or a rebound when he didn't. His offensive skills helped land him 
a spot on the Gulls' power-play unit. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he's simply playing to his strengths. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know where to be in my own end," Loach said. "Just because I take chances 
trying to do something offensively . . . that's my job. That's what I do. I 
wouldn't say I'm a bad defensive player." 
</P>
<P>
 Loach will have a chance to prove it Wednesday night when the Ducks face the 
Philadelphia Flyers at Anaheim Arena.

MONTCLAIR PREP BLASTS FORMAT FOR PLAYOFFS; HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL: ABRAMS 
BELIEVES HIS 15-6 TEAM DESERVED POSTSEASON BERTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An angry and frustrated Howard Abrams, coach of the Montclair Prep boys' 
basketball team, criticized the Southern Section playoff system Monday, saying 
his team was unfairly omitted from the playoffs that begin tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mounties, a free-lance team that finished 15-6 and played 18 games against 
teams that advanced to the playoffs, did not receive a berth because there were 
none allotted to free-lance teams in Division IV-A. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell me we're not supposed to be in and I can stand it," Abrams said Monday. 
"Tell me we didn't win enough games, but don't tell me there aren't any spots 
left." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the teams that received berths in Division IV-A, five have losing records 
and three others finished the regular season at .500. All of those teams 
qualified automatically by placing in the top half of their respective leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section Commissioner Dean Crowley said Montclair Prep was excluded 
because of the size of Division IV-A, which uses a 16-team bracket with a 
20-team limit. The majority of divisions use 32-team brackets. Division size is 
based on the number of schools that share similar enrollment levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Under section guidelines, free-lance teams are ineligible for a 16-team 
bracket with a 20-team limit. The division's eight wild-card teams (12 teams 
draw automatic berths) must be drawn from league teams, Crowley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We followed all of our rules and all of our guidelines," Crowley said. "They 
are a free-lance team and free-lance teams are not part of the pool we draw 
from to fill the wild-card spots." 
</P>
<P>
 That answer provided little comfort for Abrams. "Their concept is that they're 
not splitting the atom," he said. "Somebody should say this isn't right." 
</P>
<P>
 Crowley denied that the ruling was related to Montclair Prep's history with 
the Southern Section. Montclair Prep had been banned from postseason play in 
all sports for the 1991-92 school year because of recruiting violations in the 
football program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely not," Crowley said. "The football thing, that's in the past. They 
are a free-lance team and they're not in a league and it's just a difficult 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Two seniors on the basketball team, Aaron Mintz and Jack Pollon, went to the 
section offices in Cerritos immediately after practice Monday morning to plead 
the Mounties' case, but changed no minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair Prep twice beat Sierra Vista (13-10), which earned a Division II-AA 
berth, and also posted victories over playoff teams Campbell Hall, Crossroads 
and Maranatha. Montclair Prep lost by one point to highly regarded St. Francis. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, the Mounties lost to Whittier Christian, 57-44, but practiced 
Friday to prepare for the playoffs. The team met at the usual time again Monday 
morning, unaware that the season was over. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowley intimated that he will suggest a rule change next season that would 
give an automatic berth to free-lance teams that win somewhere between 65% and 
75% or more of its games. He wasn't certain on the exact percentage he would 
propose. However, that does little to appease the Montclair Prep seniors who 
are now turning in their uniforms.

COACH REESE TO REJOIN ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel coach Jimmie Reese, 92, who was too ill to be in uniform the second half 
of the 1993 season, is scheduled to leave today to rejoin the team for the 
opening of their spring training camp in Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese, with the title of conditioning coach, will be entering his 78th season 
of professional baseball and 22nd with the Angels.He was hospitalized twice 
last season, and was unable even to attend games the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be great to have him back," Angel Manager Buck Rodgers said. 
"Jimmie Reese is an original. No one is loved more in all of baseball." 
</P>

MANSION MARKET HEATS UP; REAL ESTATE: A PRICE PLUNGE SINCE THE '80S HAS 
TRIGGERED 'BARGAIN HUNTING' IN O.C. FOR $1-MILLION-PLUS HOMES. 
</P>

<P>
 The same forces driving the stampede to buy that first home are pushing action 
in another arena. Local real estate brokers and experts say they're seeing a 
notable increase in sales of mansions. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the buying binge by the well-heeled are low interest rates, an 
improving economy -- and some rock-bottom deals. Prices of multimillion-dollar 
estates with spacious rooms and breathtaking views have plummeted more than 30% 
since the 1980s. As a result, those who can afford to are deciding that now is 
the time to buy that magnificent estate or ocean-view property, real estate 
brokers and analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen a flurry of activity in homes priced more than $1 million in the 
past six months," said Margaret Goedeke, a broker with real estate company 
Donmar Ltd. in Newport Beach. "The prices have softened, and people are trying 
to scoop those homes up." 
</P>
<P>
 Wealthy buyers today are much more cautious than in the go-go 1980s, brokers 
say, and are more careful not to overextend themselves when they borrow. Also, 
they're being picky -- their prerogative, given the dramatic decline of prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Bargains abound. One 6,000-square-foot home in Linda Isle, off Bayside Drive 
in Newport Beach, sold for $3.6 million in 1989; last year it went for $2.8 
million, according to Dataquick Information Systems, a real estate information 
firm in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
 William Cote, a Newport Beach realtor who specializes in multimillion-dollar 
properties, said he recently sold another Linda Isle home for $650,000. The 
seller had bought the house in 1990 for $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been an increase in sales of $1-million homes in the past couple 
months, but with a discount," Cote said. "There are a lot of bottom fishers out 
there who are buying the foreclosed properties, and I've seen some big 
properties sell recently," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the wealthy, Cote said, are bargain hunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are so spoiled around here. As a result, there is a great level of caution 
among buyers. They just want deals. If you've got a $3-million house on the 
market, they want a $400,000 discount," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The number of multimillion-dollar home sales has steadily declined during the 
recession, according to Dataquick. There were 302 such transactions in Orange 
County in 1990, 246 in 1992 and only 186 last year. For 1994, however, the 
trend may reverse, at least locally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been hearing that properties in the $1-million range are going like 
crazy in both Orange and San Diego counties but not Los Angeles," said John 
Karevoll, an analyst with Dataquick. "The multimillion-dollar sales have really 
picked up in the last three months." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Amstadter, a Prudential California agent for homes in pricey 
neighborhoods such as Linda Isle and Harbor Ridge, about half a mile from 
Pelican Hill, said she is seeing some increased interest in luxury homes, but 
she noted that buyers are extremely careful. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are looking for bargains. They are not speculating like they were in 
the 1980s," she said. "They want homes in perfect condition, they don't want to 
inherit someone else's problems, and as a result they are making great buys." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those buyers is Bob Siemon, who runs his own manufacturing and 
distributing firm. Siemon, who had been planning to remodel his home, recently 
decided instead to invest in a Newport Beach hilltop site and build his dream 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 "The remodeling grew and grew, and it was going to cost an arm and a leg. So 
we decided to take a look at houses," Siemon said. "We looked at about 50 of 
them. It's funny, first you start looking at homes for $1 million, then it's $2 
million, then you start looking at $3 million." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Siemon decided to build. After selecting a prime lot in Pelican Hill, 
Siemon spent the night on the doorstep of the Irvine Co. to make sure he was 
first in line when the $1.5-million lot went on sale as part of the second 
phase at the development. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next guy showed up at 4 a.m., so I beat him," Siemon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. is one of several firms benefiting from the boom. Its ritzy 
Newport Coast development, considered one of the last pieces of coastal 
property in California available for new homes, has been very successful, 
brokers say. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past two years, the company has sold 123 coastal lots in Pelican 
Point, Pelican Hill and Ocean Ridge at an average price of $1 million each. 
Reflecting the upturn in the mansion market, the company has sold 42 custom 
lots, or about six a month, since August -- and in the past four weeks it has 
sold 11 lots at about $1 million apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 "The buyers' level of confidence is clearly increasing as their businesses are 
improving," said Rudy Svrcek, vice president of sales for the Irvine Co. "We 
hear quite often they feel we've hit the bottom of the market, so they want to 
buy now."  
</P>
<P>
 Svrcek said that 51% of the buyers at Newport Coast are business owners, 25% 
are doctors, 12% are chief executive officers of major companies and 7% are 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This signals to us that these buyers are mostly business leaders. These are 
people who have a history of making good business decisions with a keen sense 
of timing," Svrcek said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those buyers, he said, at least 50% are paying cash, so low interest rates 
are not much of a factor in the sales spurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Another exclusive development in the same area has not done so well but may be 
poised for a turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 Smithcliffs, once a private estate, was purchased by developer Greg Brinderson 
for $15 million in 1985. The enclave has 26 ocean-view sites on the cliffs 
above Laguna Beach overlooking Emerald Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of regulatory snags and other delays, the lots were not put up for 
sale until last year, and only one lot was sold during 1993. In January, 
however, three Smithcliffs lots were sold for about $400,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot of interest since Jan. 1," said Jack Chuster, director of 
sales at Smithcliffs, where prices go as high as $4.9 million for a lot with 
water on three sides. "There's an 'up' feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly the sentiment expressed by buyer Siemon, who is building an 
8,000-square-foot house with lots of glass to take advantage of his ocean and 
bay views. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, I'm on top of the world," he said. Top-Dollar Homes 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's five biggest home sales in 1993 all were in the Newport-Laguna 
Beach areas. Neither of the homes in Laguna Beach was damaged in the fire that 
swept through the area late last year. 03,23,20,15 Buyer Address City Winslow

JAPANESE OWNER TO SELL CHUNK OF WESTIN CHAIN; DEALS: MEXICAN CONGLOMERATE WILL 
PAY AOKI CORP. $708 MILLION FOR HOTELS. THEY INCLUDE THE SOUTHLAND'S WESTIN 
BONAVENTURE, CENTURY PLAZA AND WESTIN SOUTH COAST PLAZA.

<P>
 Aoki Corp., a large Japanese developer that owns Westin Hotels & Resorts, said 
Monday that it has agreed to sell a large portion of the lodging chain to a 
Mexican conglomerate for $708 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale marks another retrenchment for a Japanese multinational and is at 
least a partial reflection of global economics. Many Japanese corporations have 
been hurt because of the deep recession in their home country, while many 
businesses in Mexico have benefited from that nation's rapid expansion in trade 
and investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the deal, Westin's brand name, business and operations in North America, 
South America and Europe will be owned by DSC, a large Mexico City-based 
construction and real estate firm with interests in hotels and travel agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Westin currently owns and operates 70 properties worldwide, including the 
Westin Bonaventure in downtown Los Angeles, the Century Plaza Hotel & Tower in 
Century City and Westin South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Aoki, which purchased Seattle-based Westin more than six years ago for $1.53 
billion in partnership with the Bass Group of Texas, will retain Westin's 
properties in Asia, six hotel properties in Canada and several minority 
investments in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "This transaction underscores the interest Mexican companies have in becoming 
global competitors," Bernardo Dominguez, the executive chairman of DSC, said in 
a joint statement with Aoki. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisaku Murakami, a spokesman for Aoki Corp., said the Japanese recession was 
not "a direct cause for this decision. The purpose is to reorganize our hotel 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 "By reorganizing its hotel business and selling hotels, the Aoki group can 
improve its cash flow and earnings," Murakami said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aoki's purchase of the Westin chain from the parent of United Airlines in 
October, 1987, was one of the biggest Japanese takeovers of an American 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other Japanese companies also went on a worldwide hotel buying spree 
during the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has not worked out great for them," Bruce Baltin, a lodging industry 
analyst, said of Japanese hotel investment. "They came into the market late. 
They just paid too much."

SECRET NORTHROP MISSILE RACKS UP SKY-HIGH LOSSES; AEROSPACE: THE STEALTH TSSAM, 
UNDER DEVELOPMENT IN HAWTHORNE, IS EXPECTED TO BE ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE IN 
THE U.S. NON-NUCLEAR INVENTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Northrop Corp. is developing a secret missile that is supposed to be invisible 
to enemy radar, but the weapon's bloated cost has become an all-too-familiar 
sight on the company's balance sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 Intended to be one of the Pentagon's most advanced weapons, the missile is the 
tri-service standoff attack missile, known as TSSAM. (Tri-service refers to its 
ability to be launched by Air Force and Navy aircraft, and by Army units on the 
ground.) 
</P>
<P>
 The TSSAM is expected to be one of the most expensive non-nuclear missiles in 
the U.S. arsenal. The Air Force estimates that the total cost of each Air Force 
TSSAM will be $2.1 million, with each Navy version to cost $5.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 TSSAM remains a military secret, and no photograph or sketch of the stealth 
missile has ever been made public. Under development since the mid-1980s, its 
existence was acknowledged only three years ago, when the Pentagon disclosed 
that the missile was being developed at a Northrop plant in Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, however, TSSAM's costs have become glaringly obvious. Northrop 
recently said its profits last year fell 21%, to $96 million, because of a 
TSSAM-related loss of $201 million. Earnings in 1992 included a similar loss of 
$152 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-based Northrop, which also builds the B-2 stealth bomber, has lost 
more than $600 million on the project since it was launched. "We did not 
anticipate the degree of complexity that's involved," admitted James G. Roche, 
Northrop's head of advanced development and planning. 
</P>
<P>
 The losses are likely to continue -- though not at their present pace -- until 
1997 when the missile will finally be ready for production. The program's 
director, Air Force Brig. Gen. Richard Roellig, has estimated that Northrop's 
total losses could eventually reach $750 million, while some two dozen 
subcontractors could lose another $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop is developing the missile under a fixed-price contract, meaning it 
has agreed to receive a fixed amount of money from the Pentagon for design and 
testing. Northrop has to absorb any costs above the contract amount. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon valued the entire project at $15.1 billion in 1991, but did not 
break out the price of Northrop's research-and-development portion. TSSAM is 
the last of Northrop's fixed-price contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Fixed-price contracts were embraced by the Pentagon in the mid-1980s as a way 
to curb procurement fraud and general military spending. But they later fell 
into disfavor after contractors sustained major losses developing sophisticated 
hardware whose costs soared above initial estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas Corp. and General Dynamics Corp., for instance, are in court 
trying to recoup $1.5 billion from the Pentagon for developing the now-canceled 
A-12 Navy attack jet under a fixed-price contract. McDonnell's trouble-plagued 
C-17 military cargo jet is more than $1 billion over its budget, and Hughes 
Aircraft Co. lost more than $250 million developing the advanced medium range 
air-to-air missile (AMRAAM). 
</P>
<P>
 As for TSSAM, Northrop is confident it can overcome the missile's technical 
obstacles, Roche said. "It's just that we're not able to build the missile 
under a fixed-price contract at the price that was specified." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the TSSAM is classified, Northrop has said the weapon would be a 
cruise missile, meaning that it would use its own engine to fly to its target. 
The missile would have a range of more than 100 miles, and could attack enemy 
airfields, ships and air-defense and command-and-control sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army recently bowed out as a customer, cutting the number of missiles to 
be bought by the Pentagon by nearly one-third and making the "tri" portion of 
the program's name obsolete. But Roche said Northrop still hopes to garner $10 
billion or more in sales from producing the TSSAM into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 While no formal production contract has been signed yet, the Pentagon now 
plans to have one contractor build all the missiles, instead of two as 
originally planned, Roche said. Northrop obviously expects to be the TSSAM's 
sole source. Pentagon officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Army is no longer involved, the Air Force and Navy have told 
Northrop that they're still committed to the weapon, Roche said. But any 
further snags in the TSSAM's development could jeopardize the missile's 
standing in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, the House Appropriations Committee urged that TSSAM be canceled, 
based on a General Accounting Office report that outlined the missile's woes. 
"This program has a history of development problems, cost growth and schedule 
delays," the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop can ill-afford further cuts in the program. The company's sales 
already are expected to drop sharply after 1997, when Northrop will have 
finished building the 20 B-2 bombers ordered by the Air Force.

TRADE WAR FEARS SEND DOLLAR PLUNGING; MARKETS: U.S. CURRENCY DROPS TO NEARLY 
SIX-MONTH LOWS AGAINST THE YEN, SENDING JAPANESE STOCKS INTO A TAILSPIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The U.S.-Japan trade rift sent the dollar plunging to nearly six-month lows 
against the yen Monday, pummeling Japanese stocks and pulling other Asian 
markets down as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's slump, and Asian markets' slide, continued early today, as 
investors feared a damaging trade war could erupt between the two countries. 
Tokyo's Nikkei stock index, which slid 531.45 points to 19,459.25 on Monday, 
was off 501.95 points or 2.6% to 18,957.30 at midday today. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the U.S. stock market shrugged off the concerns, closing mixed 
Monday. Long-term U.S. bond yields rose modestly, while gold gained. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar closed at 102.65 yen on Monday, a drop of 4.2% from 
107.20 on Friday, as traders reacted to the weekend collapse of trade talks 
between President Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton had sought numerical targets for trade in the fight to open what the 
United States contends are unfairly sheltered Japanese markets. But Hosokawa 
balked. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's tough talk after the trade summit immediately raised fears of 
unilateral trade sanctions against Japan. Also, some analysts believe the 
United States now will encourage a stronger yen and weaker dollar in an effort 
to instantly cheapen prices of U.S. goods sold in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence, currency traders quickly knocked the dollar down on Monday. It traded 
at one point at 101.00 yen, a level not seen since Aug. 17, the day the dollar 
hit a post-World II low of 100.40 yen. 
</P>
<P>
 Early today in Tokyo the dollar traded just above 102 yen, before Japan's 
central bank intervened to stabilize the currency. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Tokyo stock market's tumble reflected investor worries that the 
yen's soaring value will crimp Japanese exports, by automatically raising their 
prices here and elsewhere abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Fears of a trade war also weighed on other Asian markets, most of which are 
export economies. Hong Kong's Hang Seng stock index sank 515.22 points, or 
4.5%, to 10,988.81 on Monday, though analysts said worries about rising 
interest rates also hit Hong Kong shares. 
</P>
<P>
 At midday today the Hang Seng was off 50.75 points to 10,938.06. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea's main stock index dropped 15.77 points to 901.38 on Monday and 
was off 2.08 points early today. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the President Clinton refused to rule out a possible all-out trade 
war with Japan, although he said he would take "some days" to mull the full 
range of options before imposing sanctions on Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the U.S. stock market ended mixed in choppy trading Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial index added 9.28 points to 3,904.06, and advancing 
issues narrowly outnumbered declines on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, smaller stocks gained ground, with the Nasdaq composite index up 4.06 
points to 785.45. 
</P>
<P>
 But some broader indexes, such as the NYSE composite, were marginally lower. 
Big Board volume came to a moderate 263.2 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the market had a generally calm reaction to the dollar's plunge, 
traders noted that the Dow was up more than 25 points early in the day, a gain 
that evaporated as the dollar's decline intensified. 
</P>
<P>
 Losses in most European markets overnight, in addition to the slump in Asian 
stocks, weighed on U.S. investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, analysts noted that a falling dollar was bullish for U.S. exporters and 
for auto makers and other industrial companies that compete head-on with the 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end it's going to allow them to penetrate the Japanese market more, 
and in the short-term it benefits them because they become more competitive," 
said Patrick Moriarty, chief investment officer at Bank Julius Baer. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto stocks rose. Chrysler gained 3/4 to 59 3/4, Ford added 1/4 to 65 3/4 
and GM was up 5/8 to 61 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other industrial winners included Whirlpool, up 2 1/2 to 70 1/2; Boeing, up 
1 to 44 5/8; GE, up 7/8 to 108 1/8; and United Technologies, up 2 to 67 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rebounding tech stocks included Adobe Systems, up 1 1/8 to 30; Sun 
Microsystems, up 1 3/4 to 26 1/2; Lotus Development, up 2 1/2 to 58 1/4; and 
Newbridge Networks, up 1 5/8 to 64 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pfizer fell 1 1/8 to 58 1/4 on reports the drug giant is trying to forge a 
strategic alliance with foreign rival Glaxo. Glaxo's NYSE-traded shares gained 
1/4 to 19. 
</P>
<P>
 * QVC Network gained 1 5/8 to 48 1/2 amid speculation that rival Viacom had 
won the protracted bidding war for Paramount Communications. Viacom class A 
fell 1 5/8 to 34 7/8, and Viacom class B dropped 1 3/4 to 29 7/8. Paramount 
fell 3/4 to 76 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * WMX Technologies gained 1/8 to 24 7/8 after prosecutors in California said 
they wouldn't appeal a decision last week dismissing theft charges against a 
WMX Technologies unit and eight employees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Iwerks Entertainment shot up 2 1/4 to 25. The Burbank-bases special-effects 
firm said it will build a series of specialty theaters for a chain of family 
complexes owned by Blockbuster Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Telmex gained 7/8 to 73 7/8 on the NYSE, even though the Mexican stock 
market closed lower again. The Mexico City stock exchange's Bolsa index fell 
23.23 points to 2,778.83. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 Long-term Treasury bond yields rose slightly on muted fears that the dollar's 
plunge against the Japanese yen would prompt Japanese investors to sell U.S. 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year T-bond's yield rose to 6.45% from 6.40% on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But yields on shorter-term securities barely budged. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospects for a weakening dollar sparked fears that Japanese investors would 
dump dollar-denominated securities -- especially bonds -- to cut exchange rate 
losses. When the dollar falls against the yen it automatically erodes the value 
of U.S. securities owned by Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts said there was little indication that Japanese investors were 
selling off their holdings of Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
 A report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on regional economic 
conditions also prompted some bond selling, Chan said. The survey showed a

precious-metals' attractiveness.

RUNNING ON HOPE; STRIP-MALL SHOPS AND SOME LANDLORDS STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE

 From the door of her small shop on Reseda Boulevard, Roya Saberzadeh surveyed 
the scene outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the block, one apartment building after another was condemned, including 
the Northridge Meadows complex just across the street, where 16 people died in 
the Jan. 17 earthquake. The National Guard troops were gone, the sightseers 
dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
 At her shop, Rochie's Greek Row -- which sells clothes and memorabilia with 
insignia from college fraternities and sororities -- Saberzadeh long ago 
cleaned up the broken glass. She reopened two weeks after the quake with only 
one of four sewing machines operating, a damaged heat-sealing machine and 
broken wood-cutting devices. With no earthquake insurance and $50,000 in 
damage, she wonders how she'll pay her $2,000 rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Saberzadeh waited for hours at a Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster 
center, and she's hoping for a low-interest loan from the Small Business 
Administration. But the SBA is demanding extensive records, including tax 
filings and profit-and-loss statements. Loan approval could take two months. 
</P>
<P>
 And even with a loan, Saberzadeh's business would be on shaky ground. Most 
small businesses barely pay the bills. "Where am I going to get the other $600 
or $700 a month to repay the loan?" she wonders. "The economy is already bad 
enough, and my savings are depleted." 
</P>
<P>
 And so it goes for dozens of merchants on this rattled block full of 
strip-mall delicatessens, nail salons and dry-cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
 A month after the 6.8-magnitude quake, many windows along Reseda are still 
boarded up, and some stores remain dark. Saberzadeh's brother, Ramin Bezadi, 
who has two shops in the same strip mall as his sister, has seen only a few 
customers return to his fitness salon -- and none to his tanning salon. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the quake, most of these merchants survived day to day. They 
worked long hours, taking in a few hundred to a few thousand dollars each day. 
Most carried no earthquake insurance because of the high premiums and 
deductibles. And now they wonder if the apartment dwellers and Cal State 
Northridge students who once frequented their establishments have left the area 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one merchant already has called it quits. 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Pass opened the Ten Little Piggies children's shoe store 2 1/2 years ago 
in the Northridge Garden Center strip mall, a few doors north of the Northridge 
Meadows apartments. It had been slow going because of the recession, Pass said, 
and with the store closed by the quake, she is without the income needed to buy 
a spring inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're just hanging on, to come up with more money to pay your bills . . 
. it's just not worth it," Pass said. 
</P>
<P>
 So she is holding a sale in the garage of her Northridge home, selling $40 
brand-name sneakers at half-price. Her store manager, who lived in a 
now-condemned apartment building, is moving to Colorado. Two weeks ago, a 
shopkeeper from Glendora bought some of her wall hooks and displays. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurt," Pass said. "It just hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Hairo and Pierre Hairbetian, father and son owners of Andre's Shoe Repair, 
next to Rochie's Greek Row, said business has been all but nonexistent since 
the earthquake. After 11 years, they will have to cut prices and spend more 
money on advertising to bring customers back -- money they do not have. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mentally, we're destroyed," Pierre Hairbetian said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few doors down, Gianni Fontana di Trevi looked glum as he flipped through 
receipts at his dry-cleaning and tailor shop. In the last few years, although 
business was slow, he paid the bills with his usual $200 in sales a day. But 
more than two weeks after the earthquake, his sales had fallen to about $100 
one day, $50 the next. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, we were happy we were alive," he said. "Now, I worry about the 
business. This is my life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The merchants in these mini-malls aren't the only ones suffering. The 
landlords have their own demons to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Burnam, whose family owns the Northridge Garden Center, has spent the 
last month phoning contractors, meeting with structural engineers, talking to 
tenants and renegotiating her mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 About half the shops in Burnam's strip mall have reopened, but some remain 
yellow-tagged by the city. Some ceiling tiles need replacing, and cracks in 
doors, walls and floors must be patched. For Burnam, even finding an "Open for 
Business" banner proved problematic: Local suppliers were sold out. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnam feels caught between her tenants, who can't afford to pay the rent, and 
her mortgage lender. She estimated that repairs will cost $250,000, and she did 
not have earthquake insurance. Trying to sell the mall would be tough, given 
the depressed real estate market. Allowing the lender to foreclose is an 
option, Burnam said -- but hardly an attractive one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I truly have no money to run the center," she said. "My bills right now 
exceed the money in my checking account." 
</P>
<P>
 Another strip-mall landlord nearby, William Matthews, is in a similar fix. 
Matthews' family owns the two facing strip malls on Reseda where Rochie's Greek 
Row and Zeppelin Cleaners are located, and runs the malls' management company, 
Mat West Co. in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven commercial and industrial properties owned by the Matthews' family 
trust in the Northridge area all were damaged. With no earthquake insurance, 
the repairs could total $750,000, Matthews estimated. At the two Reseda 
Boulevard strip malls, many of the T-bars in the ceilings crumpled, toilets 
were rattled loose, a concrete wall toppled and the roofs ruptured in places. 
Every aftershock added to the damage; a few units remain yellow-tagged. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews has pulled workers from his Upland office to help with the cleanup 
and repairs. Still, he said, "I've only got so many crews, so much time." 
</P>
<P>
 Some shop owners have asked for relief from paying rent, which both Matthews 
and Burnam said they'll consider on a case-by-case basis. As frustrations 
mount, tensions between property owners and some tenants have surfaced. 
Matthews said a couple of unhappy tenants locked his workers out of their 
stores, blocking the repair of broken pipes and causing flooding in some other 
shops. 
</P>
<P>
 At Northridge Garden Center, Bea's Swim & Sport owner Helmut Behensky 
complained that loose roof tiles were in danger of falling. He contended that 
Burnam, the landlord, and some other tenants were rushing to reopen shops 
before proper repairs were made. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnam countered that maintenance workers have been removing the roof tiles 
that might pose a danger, as instructed by the Army Corps of Engineers. "There 
are tenants who don't want the center to reopen" because of the slow economy, 
she said. "They'd rather get out of their lease." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, all is not bleak along this hard-hit block. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura D'Angelo, owner of the Kids at Heart gift shop in Northridge Garden 
Plaza, has reopened and resumed hosting children's birthday parties and crafts 
demonstrations. On her boarded-up windows she painted "Open for Fun" in pink 
and red. One of D'Angelo's new products -- a rubber stamp that reads, "We 
Survived the Northridge Quake" -- sold out quickly, and she has ordered more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some days," said D'Angelo, "I think I can make it through." 
</P>
<P>
 And at Rochie's Greek Row, Roya Saberzadeh vows to survive. She feels she owes 
it to her mother and younger sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Saberzadeh's sister Rochanak, nicknamed Rochie, started the shop three years 
ago, but died shortly after that in a scuba-diving accident. That's when 
Saberzadeh, a civil engineer by training, took over the store. Then, last 
March, her mother died in a fire at the family home in Chatsworth. The house 
was being rebuilt, but now has earthquake damage. And the Northridge 
condominium where Saberzadeh, her brother and father were living has been 
condemned. 
</P>
<P>
 After the earthquake, Saberzadeh didn't mind that she had to go to the Red 
Cross for a $30 allowance to buy new shoes. "When you lose people that you care 
about so deeply," she said, "everything else falls into perspective." Damaged 
Stores 
</P>
<P>
 A block of earthquake-damaged stores, near the epicenter, tries to make a 
comeback.

 '93 Toy Sales Post Modest Rise: American retail toy sales rose 3% to an 
estimated $17.5 billion in 1993 from $17 billion the previous year, John 
Amerman, chairman of American Toy Manufacturers Inc., announced at the start of 
the 91st annual American International Toy Fair in New York.Amerman said 
manufacturers' shipments, in wholesale dollars, climbed 1.6% to $11.7 billion, 
short of the predicted 5% to 7% increase. Including video games, total industry 
shipments in 1993 were up 5.3% to $15.7 billion. The plush-toy category was up 
12%; activity toys grew a healthy 13% increase, and the male action toys 
category surged 26%.

 CalFed Seeks Approval for Offering: Sending a clear and final signal that it 
is spurning Golden West Financial's merger offer, California Federal Bank 
sought regulatory permission to go ahead with its plan to raise $300 million in 
preferred stock and rights offerings to finance its "hold and fix" 
restructuring strategy. The S&L, which expects to receive the proceeds from the 
offerings by the end of March, is also selling its Florida branches to raise

 GM Strike Deadline at Hand: Workers at a General Motors plant in Flint, Mich., 
that supplies important engine parts were preparing to strike this morning if a 
contract dispute over local workplace conditions remained unresolved. A strike 
by the 6,800 workers at the AC Rochester East complex could hurt GM's 
production. GM and UAW negotiators met over the weekend and again Monday but 
reported no progress.

QUAKE GENERATES NEW WAY TO SPELL R-E-L-I-E-F; TAXES: CONSULTANTS ARE CHARGING 
UP TO $500 TO FILL OUT SIX-QUESTION FORM FROM ASSESSOR'S OFFICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The disastrous Northridge earthquake is providing some of the region's more 
enterprising property tax consultants with what could be a once-in-a-lifetime 
opportunity to shake up business. 
</P>
<P>
 Law firms and brokerages, including giant CB Commercial, have turned 
earthquake property tax relief into a new product line, charging up to $500 to 
help clients prepare simple, one-page relief applications -- a practice 
government officials frown on. 
</P>
<P>
 Other professionals, such as Woodland Hills lawyer Stephen Jay, are 
distributing leaflets at community meetings in the San Fernando Valley alerting 
potential clients that he will prepare disaster tax relief applications for 
free. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to get some business later on from the people we help," said Jay, a 
partner with Jay & Easterly, which advises commercial property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners with at least $5,000 damage are eligible for temporary 
reductions in their property taxes. The Los Angeles County assessor's office 
expects up to 200,000 quake-affected property owners to receive average tax 
reductions of $140 this year. The estimate includes residential and commercial 
real estate, such as offices, apartment buildings and shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
 The enormity of the disaster has created a huge pool of potential clients for 
property tax consultants. Two days after the quake, CB Commercial's Century 
City office mailed hundreds of solicitations to commercial property owners in 
the San Fernando Valley, offering to prepare tax relief forms for as much as 
$500. 
</P>
<P>
 CB Commercial tax specialist Peter M. Smith said several commercial clients 
and individuals have paid him to complete the applications. While they are not 
complicated, the applications take time and effort, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for his fee, he said, "it is a nominal charge for paperwork handling." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials disagree. "I find that anything over 29 cents for a stamp is 
more than nominal," County Assessor Kenneth P. Hahn said. "They are taking 
advantage of the situation at a time when people should be coming together." 
</P>
<P>
 The assessor's office says the earthquake-related tax relief applications are 
so simple that anyone can do them. The applications pose six questions, 
including a description of the damage, the cost of damage and the cause. The 
assessor's staff is available to help property owners with the forms either by 
telephone or at its 13 offices throughout the county. The deadline for filing 
the applications is March 17. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New kinds of tax relief often spawn new tax relief businesses. When the 
assessor's office lowered assessments for 300,000 homeowners last spring, 
reappraisal "experts" popped up charging fees for what the government was 
already doing for free. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not illegal to charge for processing earthquake-related tax relief 
applications. And at least some of the big firms in town, such as Arthur 
Andersen and Deloitte & Touche, say they don't charge commercial clients for 
providing applications and offering simple advice. 
</P>
<P>
 The two firms have distributed hundreds of forms to maintain good relations 
with clients who could take their business elsewhere. "We view this as a client 
service," said Patrick Chambers, director of the property tax division at 
Arthur Andersen. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, pressure from the assessor's office has already forced one 
enterprising property tax adviser out of the potentially lucrative 
quake-related tax relief business. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale lawyer Michelle Matti said she realized she made a "big mistake" 
after the county assessor reprinted her newspaper ad -- "Earthquake Damage? 
Reduce Your Taxes! $199" -- in a press release warning consumers about such 
services.  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was doing a public service," said Matti, adding that she got the 
idea when a competing attorney slipped a flyer under her door. "But when I 
heard that the assessor was helping people, I stopped."

 Breast Implant Settlement: Dow Corning Corp. said it would join two other 
leading companies by agreeing to pay $2 billion over more than 30 years as its 
share of a proposed global settlement fund for women claiming injuries from 
silicone breast implants.Together with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Baxter 
Healthcare Corp., the three companies have agreed to contribute more than $3.7 
billion of a proposed settlement fund of $4.75 billion. Attorneys for women who 
have filed suit over the implants have been unable to reach agreement with 
several other defendants over their contributions to the fund. The agreements 
are subject to approval by a plaintiffs' committee and the U.S. judge 
overseeing the case.

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: LATEST BREW-HAHA; BEVERAGE GIANTS BANKING ON 'ICE' 
BEER TO RALLY SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 When John Frank goes bowling Monday nights, he pays almost as much attention 
to which beers his buddies order as he does to the score sheet. That's why 
Frank, who is editor of Beverage Industry magazine, was all ears recently when 
a nearby bowler ordered an "ice" beer -- a newfangled beer brewed at super-cold 
temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It tastes a lot colder than regular beer," Frank recalls the thirsty but 
misguided bowler saying after his first gulp. "That must be why they call it 
ice beer." 
</P>
<P>
 Those words, off-base as they are, make sweet marketing music to the ears of 
the beer giants. Facing years of declining sales, brewers are desperate to 
persuade consumers that they have created a beer that is better than 
yesterday's brew. 
</P>
<P>
 Ice beer is not a frosty mug of beer with ice cubes clinking inside. It is 
simply beer brewed at a temperature so cold that ice crystals form. The process 
was devised in Germany but popularized in Canada, and beer makers insist it 
makes the brew taste richer. Ice beer -- which often has a higher alcohol 
content than regular beer -- is already being marketed as the hottest thing 
since, well, dry beer. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Miller Brewing plans a national rollout of its light ice beer, and 
Coors begins a limited distribution of its own icy brew. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry skeptics say the brewing brouhaha is little more than a marketing 
gimmick aimed at prodding beer drinkers to pay up to 50 cents more for a 
six-pack. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of incessant ad campaigns from Madison Avenue image makers, "nobody 
wants to drink their father's beer," said Frank, who marvels at repeated 
attempts by big brewers to market something new. "I call this the slippery ice 
beer segment." 
</P>
<P>
 But the major brewers call it something else: hope. 
</P>
<P>
 In Canada, where it has been marketed for slightly more than a year, ice beer 
already accounts for nearly 12% of the market. By the end of 1994, industry 
consultants say ice beer could account for 2% of the much bigger U.S. market -- 
worth almost $1 billion in retail sales. By comparison, dry beer sales 
accounted for about 1.7% of the domestic beer market in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every brewer with a marketing department worth its salt is saying: 'Hey, I've 
got to get in on this,' " said Jerry Steinman, publisher of Beer Marketer's 
Insights, a West Nyack, N.Y.-based industry newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why each brewer is already claiming some sort of ice beer "first." 
Labatt's says it was first to sell it in North America. Coors claims it is 
first to use the technology domestically. Anheuser-Busch has first dibs on the 
draft version. And Miller boasts it is brewing the first low-calorie ice beer. 
Can a clear ice beer be far off? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Few have forgotten the huge lead that Miller Brewing took in the light beer 
segment in 1973, when it introduced light beer and everyone else watched it 
steal the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hot time for ice beer," said Lynn Dornblaser, publisher of the trade 
magazine New Product News. One year ago, the domestic ice beer segment didn't 
even exist. Today, however, a dozen or so ice beer products have already been 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will probably be one of the hottest new products of 1994," Dornblaser 
said. "But look for it to fade by 1995." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the industry push for ice beer is almost frantic. That's because the beer 
industry is reeling from five consecutive years of flat sales. The problem is 
particularly acute in California, where per-capita consumption dropped 12% last 
year, according to one consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 The big brewers have spent millions of dollars over the past decade trying to 
persuade consumers to buy new beer products that are "dry," "draft," "clear," 
"light," "low-alcohol," "no-alcohol," "low calorie" and the most recent entry 
-- "ice." 
</P>
<P>
 Several brewers have also just begun promoting "red" beers -- which are 
slightly heavier brews that typically have a reddish tint to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the mid-1970s, brewers mostly sat back and watched sales grow. But 
health concerns led to modified drinking, and some beer drinkers now prefer 
specialty beers from brew pubs and microbreweries. This has forced the brewers 
to battle fiercely for market share. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time in its history, the brewing industry has to come up with 
new ways to develop the beer market," said Bob Weinberg, a St. Louis brewing 
industry consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone approves of the ice beers, most of which have an alcohol 
content of 5.5% by volume, compared to 5% for many regular beers. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a society with 13 million alcoholics, we don't need this kind of product," 
said Thomas R. Neslund, executive director of the Silver Springs, Md.-based 
International Commission for the Prevention of Alcoholism and Drug Dependency. 
"It will appeal to younger drinkers in particular -- who are the least 
well-informed." 
</P>
<P>
 But Anheuser-Busch executives point out that their ice beer has the same 
alcohol content as their regular beer. 
</P>
<P>
 "In today's environment, we certainly don't want to get into an alcohol 
content war," said August A. Busch IV, vice president of brand management. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller Brewing Co. executives say the higher alcohol content in their ice beer 
is only the incidental result of the brewing process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not trying to sell higher-octane beer," said Richard P. Lalley, 
director of new business development for Miller, which makes Miller Icehouse 
beer, and which this week will roll out Miller Lite Ice. "We have a product 
with a taste that consumers say they want." 
</P>
<P>
 But the additional alcohol has also led to some marketing glitches. State laws 
in California and Texas are forcing most of the brewers to refer to the higher 
alcohol brews as "ale" instead of beer in regional advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, it results in some confusion," Lalley said. Still, Miller's ice beer 
sales could account for up to 4% of its market share by the end of the year, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is even a battle raging over the term ice. Labatt Breweries of Canada, 
first to sell ice beer in Canada, recently sued rival brewers Miller and Molson 
for using the term ice brewing in ads, saying it has exclusive rights to that 
phrase. 
</P>
<P>
 Coors Brewing Co., which signed a domestic licensing deal with Labatt, will 
this week begin distribution of Coors Artic (yes, that's how they misspell it) 
ice beer, said Jon Runge, new product development director. And industry giant 
Anheuser-Busch began selling Ice Draft beer in the West four months ago. By the 
end of 1994, ice beer could account for 4% of the company's sales. 
</P>
<P>
 But ice beer has a long way to go to make a believer out of Dan Snook, general 
manager of Stratton's bar in Westwood. Although his tavern has plenty of ice 
beer on tap, few of the UCLA students and professors who frequent Stratton's 
ask for it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a gimmick," Snook said. "In fact, I'm planning to phase it out." 
Briefly . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles agency Asatsu/BBDO has picked up the estimated $5-million ad 
business to help launch a new video component line for El Segundo-based Aura 
Systems. . . . The Los Angeles agency Stein Robaire Helm has picked up the 
$2-million ad account for the Santa Ana-based Orange County Register, which was 
formerly handled in-house. . . . Canoga Park-based Redken Laboratories has 
placed its $6-million account, which has been handled by Stein Robaire Helm, in 
review. . . . The Advertising Industry Emergency Fund is accepting requests for 
financial assistance from qualifying earthquake victims who are ad industry

COMPANY TOWN; GOP GROUP URGES END TO CABLE RATE CUTS; TELEVISION: THE FCC IS 
WARNED THAT MODERNIZATION PLANS ARE IN JEOPARDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just days before the Federal Communications Commission is to consider lowering 
cable rates, a group of House Republicans has warned the agency that further 
rate reductions might hurt the cable industry's ability to help modernize the 
nation's information highway. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sharply worded, two-page letter to FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, nine members 
of the House subcommittee on telecommunications and finance -- including the 
ranking Republican, Rep. Jack Fields of Texas -- warned that "any further 
downward rate adjustment by the FCC can only be read as an expression that you 
do not believe that there is any meaningful role for the cable industry in 
developing the information highway of the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter could complicate Hundt's efforts to get enough votes at the FCC's 
Feb. 22 meeting to lower the so-called benchmark rate on which most of the 
11,000 U.S. cable operators must base their pricing. Before the Republicans' 
Feb. 9 letter to Hundt, several Democratic lawmakers, including the 
telecommunications subcommittee chairman, Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), had 
said they generally favored further rate cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Some political observers say any partisan split over cable rates could 
jeopardize important legislation before the telecommunications subcommittee. 
Two bills intended to lift regulatory barriers that keep telephone companies, 
cable operators and long-distance carriers out of each other's businesses, have 
had strong bipartisan support. But that could change if the FCC presses for a 
rollback. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks, Hundt and fellow commissioners Andrew C. Barrett, a Republican, and 
James H. Quello, a Democrat appointed by President Richard M. Nixon, have been 
at odds over what to do about evidence that cable television rates are still 
rising for millions of subscribers, even after 10 months of federal regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers groups have said the benchmark rate -- based on prevailing rates 
charged by cable operators in 1992 -- was too high, but cable firms say new 
price limits will derail their plans to expand to 500 channels or more by 
replacing copper wires with fiber-optic cables. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the FCC extended its cable rate freeze until May, while it 
considers whether to impose further rate reductions. "We hope (the FCC) will 
have the courage and independence to resist the cable TV lobby and order the 
reduction of still over-inflated cable TV bills," said Jeff Chester, executive 
director of the Center for Media Education, a Washington-based consumer group. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Hundt nor his chief of staff could be reached for comment.

ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS: STATORDYNE REPORTS 2ND-QUARTER LOSS OF $552,011 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Statordyne Corp., a company that is developing equipment to provide standby 
electricity to hospitals, computer labs and other critical facilities in event 
of a power outage, said Monday that it lost $552,011 in its second quarter 
compared to $140,645 in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it is a developmental stage enterprise, the Anaheim company said it 
does not have any operating revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss amounted to 12 cents a share for the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared 
to a loss of four cents a share for the same period a year ago.

BRIEFCASE: TECHNOLOGY; WONDERWARE CORP. LOSES FIRST EXECUTIVE TO FORMAL 
RETIREMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Dean Takahashi, Times staff writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter B. Pitsker has become the first executive to officially retire from 
7-year-old Wonderware Corp., an Irvine-based maker of software that gives 
factory workers greater control over machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 A start-up in 1987, Wonderware had $21 million in sales last year. The company 
went public last July, raising $32 million for a corporate expansion. A second 
offering raised about $2.5 million last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and I thought about taking time to enjoy ourselves, having put four 
kids through college," said Pitsker, 60. "Having my health, I thought it would 
be a good time to retire." 
</P>
<P>
 The company owes its success to software programs that make factory control 
equipment as easy to use as office computers. The software replaces unwieldy 
custom programs with graphics-oriented menus that operate under Microsoft 
Corp.'s Windows software, which utilizes graphics to make PCs easier to use. As 
Windows grew more popular, Wonderware's sales took off. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitsker joined the company in 1988 to help Wonderware founder Dennis B. Morin 
raise venture capital for the fledgling company. He remembers when the company 
sold its first program that year to a Kal-Kan dog-food plant in Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Pitsker was a founder and director of Triconex Corp., a competitor 
for which Morin had worked as an engineer, and a longtime consultant in the 
process-control industry. 
</P>
<P>
 After DSC Ventures in Cupertino and Houston Partners in Texas invested $1.1 
million in Wonderware in 1989, Pitsker became president and chief executive. He 
helped create the company's domestic and international sales operations. In 
1990, he handed the presidency over to founder Morin and became chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitsker was most recently the company's vice president. He and his wife, 
Polly, are moving from San Juan Capistrano to a home overlooking Lake Mead in 
Boulder City, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitsker plans to take up bicycling, jogging and boating. He will also work 
part time as a consultant. His first client: Wonderware.

OFFICE WORKERS' AVERAGE PAY UP BY JUST 1% IN '93; COMPENSATION: WITH THE 
REGIONAL INFLATION RATE AT 2.5%, MANY SAW A DECLINE IN REAL INCOME, SURVEY 
SHOWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Pay increases for office workers in Orange, Los Angeles and San Diego counties 
were almost nil last year, falling short of Southern California's 2.5% 
inflation rate in 1993, according to survey results released by Thomas 
Temporaries, an Irvine-based temporary help service. 
</P>
<P>
 Average wages in Orange, Los Angeles and San Diego counties increased by just 
1% during the past year, causing a drop in real income for many households, 
according to the survey of 1,219 Southern California companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though employers are cautiously optimistic about expanding their work 
forces, they are not optimistic enough to administer pay increases to 
employees," said Gene C. Wilson, president of Thomas Temporaries. 
</P>
<P>
 What little salary growth did occur might actually have been driven by 
corporate decisions to unfreeze salaries previously frozen in a bid to contain 
costs, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County offered the highest pay for office workers in Southern 
California during 1993, but monthly salaries for new hires remained unchanged, 
according to the survey. Pay levels for experienced office workers in Los 
Angeles County remained flat at $1,950 per month. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County ranked second in average pay, according to the survey, but 
monthly wages were basically unchanged from the 1992 levels of $1,625 for new 
hires and $1,935 for those with at least three years' experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Average pay for office workers in Riverside County increased by 6%, with new 
hires earning $1,478 a month and experienced workers receiving $1,791. But 
Inland Empire wages continued to trail the rest of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5%, was conducted by 
Strategic Consulting & Research in Irvine.

CALLING ON CELLULAR PHONES FOR EMERGENCIES; TECHNOLOGY: SALES OF THE PORTABLE 
INSTRUMENTS ARE UP FOLLOWING THE NORTHRIDGE QUAKE. MANY OF THE BUYERS ARE 
WOMEN.

 Aretha Franklin's name doesn't buy her much luck with automobiles. Twice in 
the past year, this 25-year-old single mom from Lake Forest -- no relation to 
the famous rhythm and blues singer -- has found herself by the side of the 
road, broken down, alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the Northridge earthquake, and Franklin decided it was time to buy a 
cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw those cars stranded, and I thought, 'They should have a phone in the 
car,' " said Franklin, who is a marketing representative for the credit union 
at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. "I've shown my 7-year-old son how to use 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cellular phones are growing in popularity as emergency lifelines, according to 
electronics dealers. Regular telephone service was knocked out for more than 12 
hours in parts of Los Angeles County following the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Swain, a manager for West Coast Auto Sound in Tustin, said that 50% of his 
cellular phone sales are for emergency use now, compared with about 20% at this 
time last year. Most of the others are used in business. 
</P>
<P>
 Subscribers can order either emergency or business phone service -- emergency 
service requires a lower monthly payment, but higher per-minute charges than 
phones used for business. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, emergency service carries a $25-per-month charge and costs 90 cents 
per minute for daytime use. There is no charge for calls to 911 on the PacTel 
Cellular system. One of the company's most popular plans for business users is 
based on a $70-per-month basic payment, which entitles the user to 80 free 
minutes; beyond that, the cost is 41 cents per minute in the daytime. The 
phones themselves run from about $100 to more than $500. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of cellular phones are up by 35% since the Northridge quake, said Ray 
Khorramian, owner of Converse Connections in Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 While beepers are popular among less affluent customers seeking to stay in 
touch -- basic models are $20 to $120 -- they don't provide the flexibility of 
a cellular phone. The beepers have not proven as popular, Khorramian said, 
because a person cannot use them to dial immediately for a call. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people want to be able to reach emergency services," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said many customers are women, or men who say they are buying them for the 
women in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven L. Schandler, professor of psychology at Chapman University in Orange, 
observed that people don't want to be out of touch. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have now is a tremendous swelling of insecurity," he said. "Being in 
a period of constant crisis is not normal for Californians." 
</P>
<P>
 PacTel Cellular, which serves the greater Los Angeles area from its Irvine 
office, has awakened to the use of cellular phones as emergency tools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be a tool for improving (business) productivity," spokeswoman 
Melissa May said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her company has organized a system of cells on wheels. These can be 
brought into a disaster area when the regular cells, which are like broadcast 
towers that relay signals, are damaged. Just a (Cellular) Phone Call Away 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers have discovered that cellular phones are good for more than wheeling 
and dealing. Families are buying them for the ability to reach loved ones in an 
emergency, regardless of location. Here is a short course in cellular basics: 
</P>
<P>
 THE PHONE 
</P>
<P>
 Equipment is sold at small retail shops specializing in cellular equipment and 
at large consumer electronics stores. Most stores are also authorized agents of 
PacTel Cellular or L.A. Cellular and will activate, program and repair the 
phones. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Makers: Top manufacturers include Motorola, Nokia, AudioVox, Oki, Fujitsu, 
Panasonic and Mitsubishi. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Price: $100-$700 
</P>
<P>
 -- Activation: Before a cellular phone can be activated and assigned a number, 
the buyer must get approval from PacTel Cellular or L.A. Cellular. A 
$200-$1,000 deposit may be required, depending on credit history. There is also 
a onetime activation fee of about $50 per phone, but some stores include this 
in the purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
 MONTHLY SERVICE 
</P>
<P>
 A variety of plans are available. Here are some PacTel examples: 
04,25,16,17,19 Monthly access Peak period* Off-peak period** Plan charge rate 
per minute rate per minute Personal Communications $25 90 cents 20 cents 
(Emergency) Plan Basic Plan $45 45 cents 27 cents Premium Plan *** $239 45 
cents 27 cents Discount Plans 
</P>
<P>
 A variety of plans are available for high-volume users, but most require a 
12-month subscription agreement. A cancellation fee of $100 or more is charged 
if service is deactivated during the 12-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 * 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. weekdays 
</P>
<P>
 ** 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., plus weekends and holidays 
</P>
<P>
 *** Monthly fee that includes custom-calling charges, such as call-waiting and 
about nine hours of peak or off-peak air time; per minute charges apply to 
additional time only.

DAY RUNNER INCOME DASHES UP 26.7% IN RECORD-BREAKING '93 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Day Runner Inc. on Monday credited a strong fourth quarter and increased 
business from wholesale clubs and large office product retailers for record 
1993 sales and earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Net income rose by 26.7% to $5.6 million, or 93 cents per share, up from $4.5 
million, or 77 cents per share, a year earlier.Revenue rose to $81.9 million 
last year from $71.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnings during the unusually strong fourth quarter rose by 71.6% to $3.2 
million. Fourth-quarter revenue rose to $32.3 million, up from $22.8 million a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fourth quarter of 1993 was the best quarter in Day Runner's history," 
said Mark Vidovich, Day Runner chairman and chief executive. "We believe that 
the solid groundwork we laid earlier in 1993 paid off during the crucial last 
three months of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 While Day Runner historically reports strong second and fourth quarters, the 
final reporting period of 1993 was driven by "significant growth in our sales 
to mass market customers, including wholesale clubs, the office products 
super-store channel and international customers," Vidovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related move, Day Runner changed its fiscal year end from Dec. 31 to June 
30. The change will "allow us to to do our intensive business planning during 
our less busy season," Vidovich said. The company will report a six-month 
fiscal year ending June 30, and begin the 1995 fiscal year on July 1.

MITSUBISHI UNIT PLANS TO MOVE OFFICES, 115 JOBS TO GEORGIA; MANUFACTURING: THE 
CONSUMER ELECTRONICS GROUP IS TRANSFERRING ITS HEADQUARTERS TO NORCROSS TO BE 
CLOSER TO PRIMARY MARKETS.

 Mitsubishi's Consumer Electronics Group plans to announce today that it will 
eliminate an estimated 150 jobs in Orange County and transfer about 115 of 
those positions to a new headquarters in Norcross, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 The subsidiary, which makes and markets consumer electronics products from 
big-screen TVs to cellular telephones, will be relocated by this summer, said 
Tom Chapman, vice president of corporate communications. 
</P>
<P>
 The Consumer Electronics Group is a unit of Mitsubishi Electronics America 
Inc., which is a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Electric America, the U.S. arm of 
Japan-based electronics and computer chip giant Mitsubishi Electric Corp. 
Mitsubishi employs more than 1,000 people in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 35 jobs will be lost after all the transfers are complete, 
Chapman said. He said final figures won't be known until the company determines 
whether employees agree to be transferred.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our management decided to move the headquarters as close to our customers as 
possible," Chapman said. "The majority of our overall company will remain here. 
We are committed to California and are not part of the overall industrial 
flight." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the consumer electronics group's hottest markets are on the East 
Coast, such as Florida and New York, he said. The company's Braselton, Ga., 
factory, where the company makes cellular phones and color TVs, is near 
Norcross and closer to those markets. 
</P>
<P>
 All employees who agree to transfers will be offered relocation assistance, 
Chapman said. Any employees who cannot transfer or are laid off will receive a 
severance package, he said. He did not offer details, except to say that the 
packages would be "generous." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Mitsubishi's Orange County work force will not be affected. The parent 
company of the consumer group, Mitsubishi Electronics America Inc., and 
Mitsubishi Electric America will still have 423 people based in Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsidiaries such as the company's computer chip and computer monitor units in 
Cypress will not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 The Consumer Electronics Group's western regional sales force with 50 people 
will remain in Cypress. The company's big-screen TV assembly plant, with 462 
employees in Santa Ana, will also be untouched by the relocation and a 
distribution warehouse will also stay in Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman said the Consumer Electronics Group, which has sales of about $700 
million, reported excellent sales in December and January. He added that the 
U.S. television industry is largely based on the East Coast.

CHRYSLER FACES SECOND RECALL IN A MONTH; AUTOS: SEDANS NEED WIRING REPAIR. NEON 
FIXES WERE ORDERED EARLIER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chrysler Corp. recalled 110,000 of its 1994 sedans on Monday to fix faulty 
wiring that could cause the engines to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 The action came just 10 days after the company recalled all of its new Neon 
subcompacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's recall affects the Chrysler Concorde, New Yorker and LHS; Dodge 
Intrepid and Eagle Vision models that were built from late July through early 
December of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The defect hasn't caused any injury or accident, Chrysler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The recalls have hit Chrysler as the newly resurgent company introduces new 
models designed to answer Japanese competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The new lines include the 1995 Chrysler Cirrus and Dodge Stratus, as well as 
the Neon, which went on sale Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Chrysler's handling of the recalls will be important. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quality is an issue Chrysler still has to address," said Thomas O'Grady, 
chief executive at Integrated Automotive Resources Inc. "They have to come out 
and stand behind their car." 
</P>
<P>
 David Cole, director of the Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation 
at the University of Michigan, said Chrysler had dealt well with the recalls so 
far, but customer reaction remained to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's important to the customer is that they're dealt with in a forthright 
manner -- no Mickey Mouse, and with a minimum of inconvenience," Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with the sedans could cause wiring to touch part of the steering 
mechanism and short out the car's lights or prevent it from starting, Chrysler 
spokeswoman Pamela Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Feb. 4 recall of the Neon, Chrysler instructed dealers to pick up the 
cars, offer the owners "loaners" and return the cars cleaned and with gas tanks 
filled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Neon recall, for an electrical problem that could cause the engine to 
stall, affected all 15,000 Neons built, but only 1,300 of the cars had been 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Neon recall, the latest recall has no special offers because the 
problem is neither major nor immediate, Gross said. Adding a bracket to hold 
the wire in place -- a step that would take only 45 minutes -- would correct 
the problem, according to Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first recall of the LHS luxury sedans, which had been received well 
by critics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler Concorde and Eagle Vision were recalled in 1992 
for a washer replacement. That recall affected 4,000 cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, 115,000 Jeep Grand Cherokees and Grand Wagoneers were recalled for 
repairs of a defect that could cause loss of steering control. They were also 
recalled in April, 1993 -- 87,000 for repairs to rear-door latches, and an 
additional 30,000 vehicles for suspension bolt repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Last November, 4,000 1994 Dodge Ram full-size pickups were recalled for 
tightening of a front suspension bolt. A month later, Chrysler recalled 17,800 
Ram pickups for a defective latch that made the seats to tilt forward in sudden 
stops. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler's stock rose 75 cents to $59.75 a share Monday on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

 The Grass Is Greener: Chief executives and investors mingled Monday at the 
beginning of investment firm Cruttenden & Co.'s two-day Southern California 
Growth Stock Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the 48 public companies at the sixth annual conference in Newport 
Beach gets about 15 minutes to give a sales presentation to investors and 
analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, David Samuels, former chief executive of accounting software firm 
State of the Art Inc. in Irvine, used the conference as an opportunity to 
review investments, not to give a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to be on the other side of the fence," said Samuels, who has been 
taking care of his family and relaxing since leaving the company in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels said he was taking a close look at State of the Art's larger local 
competitor, Platinum Software Corp. in Irvine, which has grown to 700 employees 
and is Orange County's largest software firm. It sells financial software to 
large corporations and medium-sized companies. After hearing a presentation by 
Gerald Blackie, chief executive of Platinum, Samuels said he was interested but 
hadn't decided whether to buy its stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, investors got to grill David Hanna, Samuels' replacement, about how 
he plans to expand State of the Art. Hanna said the $28-million company hopes 
to make acquisitions and grow at a faster pace than in the past by launching 
new software and expanding the company's international sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if Samuels might one day work for Platinum, Blackie declined comment. 
Samuels said: "I'm not looking for work. If I were, I might consider it."

MTI TECHNOLOGY TO SELL STOCK TO PUBLIC; OFFERING: THE ANAHEIM-BASED MAKER OF 
COMPUTER STORAGE EQUIPMENT PLANS TO RAISE $40 MILLION TO $48 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 MTI Technology Corp., a maker of computer storage equipment, said it plans to 
raise $40 million to $48 million by selling stock to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 In a filing last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company 
said it plans to use the money from the initial public offering to pay off as 
much as $23 million in bank debt. The rest would be used for working capital 
and general corporate purposes, including research and development and 
potential acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, recognized last year by Inc. magazine as one of the 
fastest-growing private U.S. companies, plans to offer 4 million new shares at 
$10 to $12 apiece. Company executives and shareholders also plan to sell an 
additional 1.7 million shares that they now hold.  
</P>
<P>
 Steve Hamerslag, chief executive, plans to sell 300,000 of his 2.66 million 
shares. Ray Noorda, who is chairman of MTI and founder of Utah-based network 
software giant Novell Inc., would sell 650,000 of his 8.06 million shares. 
Noorda and a venture capital firm that he controls would own about 38% of the 
19 million shares after the offering. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock sale, for which no date has been set yet, is being underwritten by 
investment banks Prudential Securities Inc. and Furman Selz Inc., both in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 MTI, which has 600 employees, sells systems such as tape libraries that store 
archives of data. It also sells FailSafe computer systems, which are designed 
to save data even if power is lost. It generates about 90% of its sales from 
products that enhance or work with equipment made by Digital Equipment Corp., a 
computer giant based in Maynard, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fiscal year ended April 3, 1993, MTI reported a loss of $5.7 million, 
compared to a loss of $12.9 million for the previous 12 months. Annual revenue 
was $115.7 million, up from sales of $104 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss for fiscal 1993 included a $10.1-million charge for the settlement of 
a patent infringement lawsuit with Digital as well as costs to shut down the 
company's Lexcel network management software division. The settlement with 
Digital forced MTI to drop down two product lines that allegedly infringed on 
the computer giant's patents. That cost MTI about $6.7 million a quarter in 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 For the previous year, the company reported a one-time charge of $18.3 million 
related to the acquisition of the assets of SF2 Corp., a start-up company that 
owned patented technology for high-end computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, MTI acquired System Industries Inc. in Milpitas. Those costs will 
be included in results for the current fiscal year. For the nine months ended 
Jan. 1, the company reported a profit of $1.5 million on sales of $67.4 
million. That contrasted with a loss of $11.9 million on revenue of $67.1 
million for the same period a year earlier.

 PCC Group Inc.: The Brea microcomputer wholesaler reported first-quarter 
earnings Monday of $135,000, a 70% drop compared to the same period last fiscal 
year, when the company had $458,000 in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said its earnings per share were 4 cents for the quarter ended 
Dec. 31, compared to 21 cents a share in the same period last year.It came on 
revenues of $15.9 million, a nearly 39% reduction over the $25.8 million 
reported in the first quarter of last fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 PCC blamed the earnings decrease on lower sales volume, tighter profit margins 
and high interest costs because of unplanned borrowing. The reduction in 
revenue was blamed on downsizing and a corporate diversification program 
initiated in June, 1993.

NAMES REJECT $1.32-BILLION LLOYD'S OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lloyd's of London said Monday that its offer of compensation to its members, 
aimed at staving off court action, has failed. 
</P>
<P>
 It said a $1.32-billion settlement proposal to 22,000 of the insurance 
market's backers, investors known as Names, had been rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 A balloting of the Names, mostly members of the wealthy families who have 
supported the market since its inception 300 years ago, closed Monday with only 
38% accepting the offer by value. Lloyd's had been looking for 70% acceptance, 
by value. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd's made the offer in an effort to dissuade Names from suing many of their 
agents in the world's largest insurance market. 
</P>
<P>
 The Names have set up more than 30 action groups to investigate and pursue 
allegations of negligence and mismanagement against their agents, since the 
announcement of record market losses of $8.07 billion over the last three 
years. The losses were attributed to claims stemming from a number of major 
natural disasters around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd's Chairman David Rowland said the result of the vote was regrettable and 
that litigation was the only course remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always made it clear that whether or not we achieved a resolution 
would not affect the future development of the Society (Lloyd's)," Rowland said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Lloyd's said the compensation offer had lapsed. Rowland said 
he would concentrate on enacting a business plan, unveiled last year, for 
restoring the troubled market to profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent analysts said last week that the Names also would face losses of 
at least $4.4 billion over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Names' action group leaders said the settlement offer would have stripped the 
Names of too many of their legal rights. They described it as one-sided, in 
favor of market professionals.

 Triconex Corp.: The maker of safety shut-off systems for industrial plants 
said Monday that it has acquired a Louisiana engineering firm that serves the 
petrochemical industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine-based Triconex said it acquired Premier Engineering Inc. of Baton 
Rouge, La., for $1.9 million.It described Premier as a profitable operation 
employing 35 people, with $2 million in revenues last year and strong growth 
projected this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Triconex President William K. Barkovitz said the acquisition should help 
Triconex use the engineering expertise to find solutions for its customers' 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the third major acquisition in a year. Triconex bought Tri-Sen Systems 
Inc., a digital turbo-machinery control maker based near Houston, last year. 
Triconex also has signed a letter of intent to acquire Precision Light 
Measurement Systems Ltd., a maker of infrared combustible gas detection systems 
in Plymouth, England, in January.

O.C. AUTHOR KOONTZ PLANS 30,000-SQUARE-FOOT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Best-selling suspense author Dean Koontz and his wife, Gerda, took advantage 
of the recent bargains in Orange County real estate to buy 2 1/2 acres in 
Newport Coast, where they are planning to build a house. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koontzes reportedly paid about $4 million for the four adjacent ocean-view 
lots that overlook Newport Harbor and have a view of Catalina Island. They hope 
to build an Italian Renaissance-style estate of at least 30,000 square feet, 
which would make it one of Orange County's biggest houses, Koontz said. 
Groundbreaking could start in August, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the county's largest private residences now is a 20,293-square-foot 
Coto de Caza home owned by developer William Lyon, according to Continental 
Lawyers Title Co. in Santa Ana. And Dr. Bakul K. Patel has filed for a permit 
to build a 28,806-square-foot house in San Clemente on a rural seven-acre lot. 
If the Koontzes' plans fall through, Patel's could be the largest home in the 
county, according to building permit data. 
</P>
<P>
 Koontz said he decided to buy the pricey lots in Pelican Hills early last year 
before any perceived market turnaround. He said that getting rock-bottom prices 
in the high end of the market is more difficult today because people sense a 
market recovery. And that, he says, makes sellers drive harder bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 The 48-year-old author, known for novels such as "Cold Fire" and "Hideaway," 
said that, though the couple's luxury estate is still on the drawing board, he 
is certain that one large room overlooking the sea will be designed as a 
writing room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always used to write in very small rooms, little caves really. We just 
never imagined we'd be able to have ocean views in our lives," Koontz said. 
"I'd probably be happy sitting up on those lots in the dirt." 
</P>
<P>
 Because he is a writer, Koontz said, he and his wife want privacy and also 
want to be involved in the design of their home. He would not divulge details, 
such as the number of rooms or any special features. 
</P>
<P>

WIDELY USED DERIVATIVE INVESTMENTS FOCUS OF WALL STREET DEBATE; FINANCE: 
HIGH-TECH, COMPLICATED AND LARGELY UNREGULATED, THEY COULD BE 'TOO MUCH OF A 
GOOD THING.' 
</P>

 When they evaluate the quality and safety of an income mutual fund these days, 
many people now make a point of asking where the fund stands on derivative 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 These types of investments -- high-tech, complicated and widely used -- have 
become the center of a debate on Wall Street reminiscent of the debate over 
computer program trading in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 When derivatives in their many guises are used prudently, their advocates say, 
they can serve to increase yields, reduce risk or limit the costs of investing 
for current return. 
</P>
<P>
 But numerous skeptics complain that they aren't always put to prudent use, and 
that they could cause some big headaches before long. 
</P>
<P>
 "Derivatives are useful and innovative tools when used properly," says Randy 
Merk, a senior vice president and fund manager at the Benham Group in Mountain 
View, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Merk observes in the firm's latest bulletin to investors in 
its mutual fund family, "derivatives prove that you can indeed get too much of 
a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
 To some, that's an understatement. "Critics of the derivatives market, 
including myself, have always feared that there could be some computer nerds 
out there using derivatives to build the financial equivalent of an atom bomb," 
says Raymond F. DeVoe Jr., an analyst at the brokerage firm of Legg Mason Wood 
Walker Inc.  
</P>
<P>
 "Faulted strategies traditionally are discovered under stress," DeVoe adds. 
</P>
<P>
 The term derivatives encompasses a wide variety of financial products with 
exotic names like interest-rate swaps, Treasury strips and collateralized 
mortgage obligations. They are, in effect, synthetic concoctions derived from 
more traditional securities such as stocks and bonds, or from naturally 
occurring economic phenomena such as currencies and loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Their main proponents are large money-center banks, who use them for 
themselves and provide them to a wide array of customers that includes many 
income mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The level of concern is ironic because derivatives are used primarily to 
reduce risk," says James Benham, the Benham Group's chairman, in a commentary 
accompanying Merk's. "Some concern is indeed justified, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "The derivatives market is still largely unregulated. They are typically not 
traded on exchanges and are not subject to disclosure laws and government 
regulation, largely because lawmakers don't understand them well enough to 
write laws to govern their use." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of interest-rate swaps, based on deals between banks, Benham says, 
"swaps increase the possibility of financial market gridlock in the event of a 
crisis such as a global market crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing and pervasive derivative use complicates the identification of banks 
that are in danger of failing. This could cause the financial system to stall 
in a crisis situation until swaps and other interrelationships are sorted out." 
</P>
<P>
 Derivatives are a challenge for mutual-fund investors to comprehend as well. 
While some funds are very helpful in trying to clarify the subject and making 
public how they use derivatives, others don't do such a good job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nearly impossible for the individual investor to know the risk 
characteristics of these," observes Chip Norton, managing editor of the 
financial newsletters published by IBC-Donoghue Inc. in Ashland, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 "You almost have to leave this up to the judgment of the portfolio manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the managers we talk to are very cognizant of the risks," Norton 
adds. "That's not to say all of them." 
</P>
<P>
 At the extreme, Norton suggests, fund investors who decide they absolutely 
don't trust derivatives can seek out a fund that, in its prospectus or other 
explanatory literature, specifically rules them out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a ticking time bomb," Norton says. "But 
it could be a small fire that no one's looking at at the moment."

O.C. ART / WILLIAM WILSON; GOING WHERE THOSE WILE THINGS ARE; AN EXHIBIT OF 
TONY DELAP'S WORK AT CAL STATE FULLERTON SUGGESTS THAT THE MOST FASCINATING 
THING ABOUT MAGIC IS OUR REACTION TO IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tony Delap's art took wing in the '60s among that flock that distilled the 
youth cults of the hot-rod and the surfboard into the Southland Slick School. 
The whole enterprise played to the accompaniment of waves of pop music. The 
pertinent ditty for Delap certainly was the Lovin' Spoonful's "Do You Believe 
in Magic?" 
</P>
<P>
 Now, three decades later, all that is a history to be sorted and mulled, and 
Cal State Fullerton's gallery director Mike McGee is offering contemplation of 
Delap's work in an installation blending re-created works and graphics that 
span the decades, making something of a vest-pocket retrospective. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a handsome catalogue designed by Jerry Samuelson that contains 
ponderable essays by Peter Clothier and David Pagel. The whole flies under the 
title "The House of the Magician," as Delap's art is about our continuing 
belief in certain illusions even after we know how they work. 
</P>
<P>
 The most uncharacteristic but visually delightful piece on view is "Floating 
Lady." The role is played in rotation by a series of female student volunteers. 
At first glance the piece seems to present an approximation of the old stage 
magician's levitation trick. The girl hovers in the air, suspended above a 
folding chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Mind you, it's perfectly obvious that she is resting on a horizontal support, 
a kind of shelf contraption. Yet one wonders how the shelf is held firm by the 
flimsy chair, and how it supports the weight of the young woman. But the 
ultimate fascination takes place in the viewer's mind. Rather than denounce the 
piece to ourselves as a cheap trick, we prefer to maintain it as a wonderful 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Floating Lady" firmly brings to mind the Cool School's old master guru, 
Marcel Duchamp. Duchamp made us see all manner of objects as artworks by waving 
the magic wand of the artist's wit, will and irony. He planted the notion that 
art is a patent illusion that works because artist and viewer alike wish to 
suspend disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 Literal suspension dominates much of Delap's work. "Large Blue Beam" greets 
viewers at the door. It hovers nose-high, seeming to emerge at an angle from 
the far wall passing through a glass pane. "Floating Lady III" is a wood beam 
across the gallery space. Ordinary enough, except a gap in the middle seems to 
make it defy gravity. Oh. A piece of plexiglass spans the gap. That explains 
it. But not quite. 
</P>
<P>
 "Houdin's House" is named for a French magician who inspired Harry Houdini. 
It's a three-sided metal enclosure with two panes of glass angled from the 
center to the open corners. The glass reflects surroundings, but the mirrored 
images seem to be on the metal walls where they don't belong. Delap's deadpan 
delivery makes the illusion delightful. Earnest historians will note that the 
work makes a bridge between the Finish Fetish a la Billy Al Bengston and Larry 
Bell's version of Light and Space art. 
</P>
<P>
 Delap's graphic series is more relaxed fun than his minimalist sculpture. He 
shows a Parisian Ferris wheel with only one spoke, an ace disappearing into a 
prestidigitator's palm, and a stick that levitates from a thumb. It doesn't 
minimize the wizardry at all that these effects are simple cut-and-paste 
graphic design devices. 
</P>
<P>
 Delap's greatest achievement may be in providing an open sesame to the 
Southland aesthetic. To this day, his colleagues from Ken Price to Ed Moses and 
Bob Graham strive to "make it magic." 
</P>
<P>
 Delap's fans also will want to see his work at Santa Monica's Mark Moore 
Gallery, through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The House of the Magician" continues through March 13 (except Saturdays) in 
the Main Art Gallery in the Visual Arts Center at Cal State Fullerton, 800 N. 
State College Blvd., Fullerton. (714) 773-3262. The Mark Moore Gallery is 2032A 
Broadway in Santa Monica. (310) 453-3031.

MUSIC REVIEW; QUARTET SINE NOMINE GETS MATINEE BLAHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A strong case of the blahs infected the local return by the Lausanne-based 
ensemble Quartet Sine Nomine Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The quartet's well-prepared, strong program -- consisting of Haydn's Quartet 
in C, Opus 9, No. 1, the Opus 3 Quartet by Alban Berg and Beethoven's Opus 130, 
with the "Grosse Fuge" -- apparently could not help this attack of 
uneventfulness. Nor could the patient-to-the-end, attentive Coleman Chamber 
Concerts audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside Beckman Auditorium at Caltech, the air was clear, the weather sunny. 
Inside, the atmosphere also had a sense of early spring. Alas, that meant, too, 
that focus and concentration became sometime things. 
</P>
<P>
 Highly praised at its local debut two years ago for its passion and polish, 
the Quartet Sine Nomine from Switzerland -- violinists Patrick Genet and 
Francois Gottraux, violist Nicolas Pache and cellist Marc Jaermann -- this time 
around seemed to have left its passion outside the hall. Its technical polish 
appeared in place, all things mechanical operating at maximum efficiency. This 
is a quartet that thinks and plays together in an easy, unforced ensemble, and 
one for whom intonational or rhythmic problems hardly exist. 
</P>
<P>
 On this occasion, only heat -- and a really potent fortissimo -- was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 The group made no convincing case for Haydn's early quartet; seemed to move 
automatically, if in handsome quietude, through Berg's Opus 3, and produced the 
clean surfaces, if not the subtextual depths, of Beethoven's late B-flat 
Quartet and Great Fugue. There is violence and vehemence in all this music; 
Sunday afternoon, the entire agenda seemed de-clawed. 
</P>
<P>
 Two more local stops remain on the Southland itinerary of Quartet Sine Nomine 
(which means Quartet Without a Name): Wednesday night at 8 in Founders Hall at 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center and Thursday at 8 p.m. in University 
Theatre at UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quartet Sine Nomine will play Haydn's String Quartet in C, Op.9, No.1; Alban 
Berg's Quartet for Strings, Op.3, and Beethoven's String Quartet No.13 in 
B-flat, Op.130 with Grosse Fuge, Op.133, Wednesday at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Curtain: 8 p.m. $20. 
A free concert preview starts at 7 p.m. (714) 556-2787.

MUSIC REVIEW; A DRAMATIC 'ALL-NIGHT VIGIL'; CONDUCTOR WILLIAM HALL AND THE 
MASTER CHORALE OF ORANGE COUNTY GIVE THE RACHMANINOFF COMPOSITION A 
LARGE-SCALE, OPERATIC INTERPRETATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BLISS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 William Hall brought operatic proportions to his direction of the Master 
Chorale of Orange County in its performance of Rachmaninoff's a cappella 
Vespers, Opus 37 ("All-Night Vigil"), at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church on 
Sunday. There is much in the music to justify this approach, and just as much 
to suggest another. 
</P>
<P>
 The composer provided scenes of abundant operatic contrast, exemplified by the 
ninth song, "Blagosloven yesi, Ghospodi" (Blessed art Thou, O Lord), a vivid 
narration of the resurrection of Christ, based on a Russian znamenni chant, 
juxtaposed against a choral response. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall attended to the various rhythms, phrase lengths and musical character for 
effective drama, though his tenor soloist, John Nuzzo, struggled to hold his 
own. The choir pushed impressively to powerful climaxes, such as in "Blazhen 
muzh, izhe ne ide na sovet nechestivih" (Blessed is the man who walks not in 
the counsel of the wicked), made all the more effective by its restrained, 
chordal ending. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, despite all the opportunities to turn outward, Rachmaninoff also 
created a subtle vehicle for intense personal expression. 
</P>
<P>
 The seamless phrases and transparent texture of "Blagoslovi, dusha moya, 
Ghospoda" (Bless the Lord, O my soul), the sad and moving tenor solo in "Nine 
otpushchayeshi raba Tvoyego, Vladiko po glagolu Tvoyemu" (Lord, now lettest 
Thou Thy servant depart in peace) -- both rooted in Eastern chant liturgy -- 
illuminate a private devotion and require great control and subtlety within the 
quiet end of the dynamic spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Master Chorale proved that its 160-plus members could muster an 
isolated pianissimo, its comfort range -- within which flourished great nuance 
and probity -- apparently hovered above mezzo piano. This caused particular 
problems for Nuzzo, who sounded ill-at-ease against his zesty cohorts in this 
reverberant venue. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, a truly profound communication came during the only real opera 
excerpt, Prince Gremin's aria from Tchaikovsky's "Yevgeny Onegin," as sung by 
Louis Lebherz. The bass brought a lush voice and a compelling vibrancy to his 
work.

DANCE REVIEW; NEW GENERATION OF PEKING ACROBATS; PERFORMANCE IN PASADENA SHOWS 
THE GROUP EVOLVING TOWARD A FREER AND MORE MOBILE VIRTUOSITY OF DARING AND 
DEXTERITY. TROUPE ALSO APPEARS IN COSTA MESA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On its sixth North American tour, the Peking Acrobats performed at the 
Pasadena Civic Auditorium on Sunday. As usual, the company members were listed 
but not specifically identified in the house program, and the souvenir booklet 
on sale in the lobby featured a different generation of performers doing 
different tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest tour (which also included two shows at Orange Coast College in 
Costa Mesa on Saturday) showcases very young Peking Acrobats (seven women, 15 
men as listed) who wear lots of glamour makeup, make lots of mistakes in their 
routines and seem to be evolving toward a freer, more mobile virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, there's been a major change in the traditional pagoda-of-chairs. 
Normally, as you'll recall, furniture is stacked on the floor or a platform 
until the pile reaches the top of the proscenium. Then somebody does handstands 
off the highest point. 
</P>
<P>
 Not anymore. These days, all those chairs -- plus a bench and the youth 
handstanding on top of it -- balance on a tiny platform on a pole that a 
hunkier youth manages to support on his head. No hands. Not even when he climbs 
a ladder to walk on a giant moving ball. 
</P>
<P>
 You like Chinese dancing lions with two performers inside each costume? The 
latest pride can do back-flips off high platforms and roll up and over 
teeter-totters with gymnasts balanced on their backs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Early in Act II, male gymnasts dive through a four-level wall of wooden hoops 
-- brilliant at mid-air contortions, sudden changes of direction and 
unpredictable linkups with their colleagues. Toward the end of the program, 
however, they become the hoops, forming a high, human Great Wall of China that 
provides both apertures for others to dive through and balconies off which the 
women hang in the air and spin. 
</P>
<P>
 So it goes: an ancient ribbon-dance performed atop a high pole with the dancer 
hanging by her teeth. A contortionist balanced on the outstretched arms of a 
gymnast. New variants on familiar displays of dexterity with whips, flying 
ceramic bowls, spinning ropes, hanging straps, tiers of glasses, uni- and 
bicycles. Plus a 9-year-old boy impersonating the Peking Opera Monkey King.  
</P>
<P>
 Better keep an eye on that kid: No telling what new feats his generation has 
in store.

COLISEUM PANEL OKS RUSH REPAIR WITHOUT BIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Without knowing how much it will cost, or how much earthquake damage may be 
discovered, Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum commissioners voted 6 to 1 Monday to 
authorize awarding a repair contract without a bidding procedure and to start 
the job immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 In formally declaring an "urgent necessity" to do emergency work, the 
commission majority hired the Tutor-Saliba construction company; a project 
manager, Don C. Webb, and HNTB architects, all of whom have done Coliseum work 
before, and instructed them to do everything necessary to finish the work by 
Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be in time for the start of the regular Raiders and USC football 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the commission president, Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite 
Burke, voted against the motion to give the work to Tutor-Saliba without bids. 
Burke said she feared a violation of regular government procedures and would 
have preferred a seven-day "fast track" bidding process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to go on record," Burke said after the vote. "I don't believe 
one week for bidding would prevent doing this project on time." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission conditioned its contract with Tutor-Saliba "on availability of 
disaster rehabilitation funding to the commission from FEMA and/or other 
federal and state disaster funding sources." 
</P>
<P>
 But Webb and Commissioner Sheldon Sloan said they understood that was assured. 
They said that when Webb told federal and state disaster officials at a closed 
meeting Monday morning that he did not want to start the work unless they 
"intend to fund this all the way," no official raised any objections. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those present were Frank Kishton, regional manager for FEMA, and Richard 
Andrews, director of the state Office of Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Kishton said Monday night: "Clearly this is an eligible structure for 
assistance. We are prepared to work with the grantee (the commission) to 
provide it." He said the federal government would give 90% of the assistance 
and the state 10% under earthquake disaster rules. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kishton cautioned that it is not a blank check. He said FEMA and the state 
will review progress, work with the grantees as they develop their conceptual 
design for the repair of the Coliseum and protection of its historic character, 
and then fund what he called "the eligible costs." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews issued a statement, saying: "Complete repair and full (seismic) 
retrofitting of the Coliseum is extremely important to the economic well-being 
and the spirit of Los Angeles. It remains a priority for the state. Today we 
have assured that the necessary cooperation from the many agencies involved 
will exist." 
</P>
<P>
 Webb has made a preliminary estimate that Coliseum repairs will cost $33 
million. But he told the commission Monday that this is contingent on no 
discoveries of "unrevealed damage" by structural engineers who have not been 
able to view covered areas of the stadium superstructure. 
</P>
<P>
 In the commission vote Monday, Supervisor Deane Dana abstained and Supervisor 
Mike Antonovich was absent. Voting for awarding the contract without bid was 
Los Angeles City Council President John Ferraro and Commissioners Sloan, Dean 
Pregerson, James Dickason, Steven Silberman and Roger Kozberg. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioners acted after hearing Webb, the project director, say that 
with less than 200 days to do the work, they could not afford to let even seven 
days go by before beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 He said structural engineers will be identifying the precise damage, and the 
architects willbe doing the design as the work goes along. 
</P>
<P>
 USC Athletic Director Mike Garrett told the commission that he feared that if 
USC is forced to play next season at either Anaheim Stadium or the Rose Bowl, 
season ticket sales would fall significantly. He strongly supported the fastest 
possible repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraro asked Webb if he is sure the work can be completed in time. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I'm not sure," the project manager said. He noted that the engineers' 
report of damage is "very conditional," and said that a timely completion 
assumes "uninterrupted funding, an unparalleled (speedy) approval process, and 
no as yet unrevealed damage having a substantially detrimental effect on the 
corrective work." 
</P>
<P>
 The motion naming Tutor-Saliba without bids came in part because of its 
familiarity with the stadium and the reliability of its past work there. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm, which did last year's $15-million stadium renovation without bids 
because it was the only company judged to meet the project specifications, has 
been involved in the Metro Rail subway project.

COUNTY MAY STIFFEN RULES ON PENSIONS; FINANCES: A PANEL URGES REFORM THAT COULD 
SAVE $30 MILLION A YEAR. BUT BOARD MAJORITY HAS RESISTED CHANGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 After suffering two years of blistering criticism, the Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors today will consider proposals to scale back its 
controversial pension rules, which boosted the retirement pay for senior 
officials by as much as 20% at a cost to taxpayers of more than $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
 A citizens panel has recommended that the board initiate a top-to-bottom 
reform of the pension system that could slow the drain on the county's coffers 
and improve Los Angeles' relationship with state officials, who condemned the 
pension plan as wasteful and self serving. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal by the Citizens Economy and Efficiency Commission would affect 
virtually all 80,000 county employees and save nearly $30 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a limited, alternative reform plan offered by the county chief 
administrative officer -- to reduce benefits only for new employees -- would 
save the cash-strapped county millions of dollars annually and send a message 
that the purse strings are being tightened at the county these days. 
</P>
<P>
 But thus far, only the two newcomers to the Board of Supervisors have endorsed 
major reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gloria Molina, who fought to bring the issue up for a vote at 
today's meeting, has fully embraced the wide-reaching reforms proposed by the 
commission, while Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke has spoken in more general 
terms about the need for an overhaul. The remaining supervisors, Ed Edelman, 
Mike Antonovich and Deane Dana, remain reluctant to change the rules.  
</P>
<P>
 Molina acknowledged that she is not certain a colleague will second her motion 
to adopt the commission proposal. But she is hopeful that, armed with the 
Economy and Efficiency Commission report and her own colorful 14-page pamphlet 
entitled "Pension Scam Simplified, the Taxpayer's Guide to the Raid on the 
County Bankroll," she can prevail. "The only thing lacking is political will," 
said Molina. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's debate promises to be personal and divisive, as it has been since the 
pension controversy first emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's decision four years ago to increase pensions of the highest-paid 
county employees and elected officials has been criticized in a string of 
investigations, studies, legislation and lawsuits by the Los Angeles County 
Grand Jury, the state Legislature, Gov. Pete Wilson, the state's largest 
taxpayer organizations and even a citizens watchdog group whose members were 
handpicked by the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury called the pension rules "the height of fiscal 
irresponsibility" and urged the board to "set an example of responsible 
government" and rescind them. 
</P>
<P>
 The pension rules, revealed by The Times two years ago, were adopted without a 
public vote of the supervisors or any study of their financial impact. They 
dramatically increased pensions by counting the value of fringe benefits, such 
as health and life insurance, as compensation for the purposes of calculating 
retirement pay. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials interpreted a state law to mean that they were compelled to 
include the amounts in pension calculations. But the author of that law said 
the intent was just the opposite. And after learning how Los Angeles County had 
used the law, state legislators quickly repealed it in unanimous votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's pension decision immediately created a deficit in the employees 
pension fund of about $267 million. The deficit has since grown to more than 
$400 million, after the rules were extended to include rank and file employees 
on a limited basis. The deficit has to be paid off by the county within 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the unusual pension rules, many senior executives and elected officials 
would earn more in retirement pay than they do on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Public Works chief Tom Tidemanson, who is planning to retire in 
March, will earn $193,000 in annual pension pay -- about $35,000 more than his 
current annual salary. Former Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who retired last year, 
collects about $126,000 in annual pension benefits, $27,000 more than his 
$99,000 salary. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the board will be asked to change that for all future retirees. 
</P>
<P>
 The Citizens Economy and Efficiency Commission has recommended that the 
supervisors scale back the pension benefits for existing employees and 
eliminate the rules entirely for all future hires. There apparently is nothing 
that can be done about those who have already retired under the existing rules. 
</P>
<P>
 County Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed, hired last year to replace 
Richard B. Dixon, who was held responsible for the pension changes, said the 
existing pension plan is one she would not have chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed is recommending that the supervisors adopt just one of the Economy and 
Efficiency Commission recommendations as a first step and leave the bulk of the 
reforms for future consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 She is recommending that the county end such pension benefits for any new 
county employees, but leave them untouched for thousands of current workers. 
Reed said she believes the board is prepared to approve that measure. 
</P>
<P>
 But Molina, who was not on the board when the decision to change pension rules 
was made in 1990, said Reed's recommendation falls short. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not good enough" said Molina in an interview. "We have to go for the 
big one" and adopt the full spectrum of the commission's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina is also calling for a policy stating that "any time the county changes 
its benefits package, the financial impacts on the retirement system must be 
quantified and approved by the Board of Supervisors." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a real opportunity," said Molina. "The savings could be dramatic, 
perhaps as high as $27 million a year." Molina calculates that the savings 
could fund 91 libraries for a year, or hire 373 law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, the Board of Supervisors has stood its ground through three 
separate votes on the issue and refused to reverse its policy. Based on the 
opinion of County Counsel DeWitt Clinton, the supervisors have argued that 
their hands are tied. They say that under the law, pension benefits cannot be 
withdrawn once they are granted. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Edelman, who will retire in December, has generally been reluctant 
to amend the rules. Dana has indicated a willingness to end the program for new 
hires, according to an aide, but he is reluctant to take away benefits for 
existing employees. Antonovich said that given conflicting legal opinions, he 
does not want to make any changes until there is a court ruling to clarify the 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 Board Chairwoman Burke, who like Molina was not on the board when the original 
decision was made, spoke out sternly about the pension scandal when she was a 
candidate for supervisor. Last week, through a spokeswoman, Burke said she 
still believes "the pension system should be overhauled" for existing as well 
as new employees. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is unclear if she will have enough support on the board, Molina's 
motion is endorsed by taxpayer advocacy groups, including the Howard Jarvis 
Taxpayer's Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a glaring example of how the system is being abused," said Joel Fox, 
president of the association. Fox's group sued the county in an attempt to 
overturn the county rules, but lost in court. The verdict is being appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The taxpayers who are paying for this don't have anything like it," said Fox 
about the generous benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a study conducted by W.F. Corroon Corp., a consulting firm, for the 
Economy and Efficiency Commission found that there is little precedent for the 
county's rules in either the public or the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county is unique among those surveyed," the commission concluded. In 
fact, a few counties do have similar programs, but the benefits are negligible 
-- a few hundred dollars annually -- compared to the amounts offered in Los 
Angeles, which can be as much as $40,000 annually for some senior executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the county's rank and file workers are also on record 
opposing the pension rules, which they say are skewed heavily in favor of 
senior management but do little for the average worker. Dan Savage, a 
representative of Service Employees International Union Local 660, said the 
union would prefer to see the rules eliminated entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, eliminating the benefits could be a thorny legal issue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The county counsel and outside legal advisers agree that the benefits do not 
have to be offered to new hires. They also agree that in general an employer 
cannot make radical changes in a pension plan once it has been offered, such as 
deleting life insurance from the pension calculations. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal advisers part ways, however, when it comes to scaling back those 
benefits to existing employees. For instance, the Economy and Efficiency 
Commission is recommending that the amount of fringe benefits be reduced or 
frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 The county counsel says that, depending on just how it is done, such a move 
could prompt a lawsuit from employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Molina dismisses the county counsel's opinion: "He's very dedicated 
to his personal retirement. It's called a conflict of interest." 
</P>
<P>
 And, referring to the county counsel's inch-thick report on the topic, Molina 
added, "You have to wonder when lawyers take that much time to explain 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 County Counsel Clinton said he had no comment on Molina's remarks, though in 
the past he has acknowledged that to some degree all county decision makers, 
including the supervisors, have a conflict when it comes to matters of pay and 
benefits.

HEALING THE REAGAN WOUNDS; PATTI DAVIS TALKS ABOUT FORGIVING AND RECOVERY IN A 
DYSFUNCTIONAL FIRST FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MILES CORWIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The seminar is entitled "Recovering From Dysfunctional Families," the cost is 
$39 and the teacher is Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald and Nancy Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, her mother beat her, Davis tells the 25 people gathered at a Culver City 
hotel. Her father refused to acknowledge it. Her mother popped a galaxy of 
pills. Her father abandoned her emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Davis says, she bemoaned her fate as yet another casualty of a 
dysfunctional family. But now she has another perspective she would like to 
share. And this perspective, she explains in a melange of pop psychology lingo 
and New Age jargon, has to do with forgiveness, healing and recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exactly!" shouted a woman at last week's Learning Annex seminar. "What you 
went through is a mirror of what I went through. There was just one difference 
-- my father wasn't President." 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald and Nancy Reagan were not simply dysfunctional parents, Davis tells the 
class. They were dysfunctional leaders of the nation. They had the same 
problems as President and First Lady that they had as her mother and father. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the reasons for the Los Angeles riots, Davis says, was that her father 
was "in denial about the problems in the inner city," just as he was in denial 
about his children's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Los Angeles riots erupted, in part, because of the policies that went on 
in the 1980s -- the cuts in social programs, the climate of elitism . . . ," 
she says. "This was just denial of all the problems going on. In situations 
like this, I watched my parents parent the country much the same way their 
parented my family." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Davis saw the Iran-Contra scandal unfold, she tells the Learning Annex 
class, "she had a sense of deja vu. " Her parents were responding to the 
scandal in the same way they responded to problems at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a whole drama to conceal what was going on behind closed doors," 
Davis says, elaborating on the issue in a later interview. "People were told to 
shut up and people changed their stories. That's the way my family dealt with 
anything that was uncomfortable. What was going on in the White House after the 
Iran-Contra story broke epitomized what went on in our home. It was our 
household magnified. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most ethical way to deal with an unethical situation would be to simply 
say: 'We did something wrong.' But nobody in a family like mine would ever 
respond like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Her father responded to the Iran-Contra scandal, Davis says, in the same way 
he responded to her when she told him as a young girl that her mother was 
"hitting me year after year." He simply would not believe the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time she was infuriated. But now she realizes that, "as an adult child 
of an alcoholic," he was "adept at turning away from things that are painful." 
With her new perspective, she sees her father as "emotionally shy" instead of 
selfish or remote or distant. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Reagan, Davis says, also approached her duties as First Lady and her 
responsibilities as a mother in much the same way. Everything was image and 
many of her efforts, such as the "Just Say No" anti-drug campaign, Davis says, 
were superficial, without ever getting to the core of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the way she tried to get rid of people, like Donald Regan, who she 
thought were messing up," Davis says. "She was just trying to change pieces on 
the board to fix an image, but she didn't dig any deeper. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like if I had friends who didn't have the right appearance, if they 
looked like hippies or something. She'd say: 'Oh, they can't come here. How 
would it look?' " 
</P>
<P>
 She now views her mother with compassion and sees her as "frightened," rather 
than merely cold or abusive. Because Nancy Reagan's "birth father abandoned 
her" she spent the rest of her life terrified. She could only find security, 
Davis says, in her ability to completely control the people and events around 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For almost a decade, Patti Davis has earned a living by parlaying her troubled 
home life into a cottage industry. She wrote three thinly veiled 
semi-autobiographical novels and an autobiography ("The Way I See It") for 
which she earned a reported $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 It might have been a tough childhood, but, unlike others at the seminar, Davis 
at least had a payoff when she reached adulthood. And Davis has been able to 
adapt her message to suit the times. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 1991 novel, "A House of Secrets," is described on the book jacket as the 
story of "a woman coming to terms with her debilitating childhood in a . . . 
successful but destructive family," and her autobiography the following year 
graphically revealed her parents' frailties and failings. At the time, there 
was a ready audience for Davis' prose. The backlash against the Reagan years 
had begun. The economy had turned sour. Acquisitiveness was no longer in vogue. 
And critical attention was focused on the budget deficit, which had ballooned 
while Reagan was in office. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, during an era when victimizers often are viewed as victims and an 
entire genre of pop psychology is devoted to forgiveness and redemption, Davis' 
new message plays well. She tells those at the seminar she once was a drug 
addict and at age 24 had herself sterilized -- a procedure which was reversed a 
decade later -- so that she would not pass on her mother's pattern of abuse to 
another generation. Now Davis has not only forgiven her parents, she says, but 
also has reconciled with them. Davis and her parents were estranged for several 
years and did not talk at all, but they had a rapprochement recently and now 
see each other occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reagans have consistently refused to comment on any of Davis' allegations. 
After her autobiography was released, they issued a statement: "We have always 
loved all of our children, including our daughter, Patti. . . . We see no 
useful purpose for further comment." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis continues to lecture on dysfunctional family life -- last month in New 
York, last week in Los Angeles, this week in San Francisco. But her latest 
novel, "Bondage," is a departure for her. Gone are the familiar portraits of 
the powerful, distant father and the wicked, abusive mother. In "Bondage," the 
father installs air conditioners and heaters and the mother is a down-to-earth 
housekeeper who pads around the kitchen in pink curlers and terry cloth 
slippers. The book, which features a panoply of sexual acts, positions and 
permutations, with an emphasis on sadomasochism, was liberating for her, she 
says, because her writing was finally free of her family. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, dressed in a style that evokes images from the book -- tight black 
skirt and top, lace-up black boots and a wide black leather belt -- has picked 
up some of the public speaking skills of her father. While she has no advanced 
psychological training, or any professional qualifications on the subject of 
dysfunctional families, she is at ease in front of her audience and speaks for 
several hours without notes. Standing behind the lectern and frequently tossing 
her head and running her fingers through her hair, she retains the mannerisms 
of the fledgling Hollywood actress she once was. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who is divorced, lives in Connecticut, is a disciple of New Age guru 
Marianne Williamson, and refers to her teachings a number of times during the 
seminar. She is in California to promote her book and give her lectures on 
dysfunctional families. Those at the lecture in a small meeting room at the Red 
Lion Inn are as interested in learning about the lifestyle of a rich and famous 
dysfunctional family as about Davis' psychological insights. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions to Davis range from the generic -- "Why is it that nice people are 
so boring?" -- to the trivial -- "What was it like having the Secret Service in 
your life?" -- to the Freudian: "Are you attracted to men like your father?" 
</P>
<P>
 There are few fans of the Reagan Administration at the seminar. One man states 
that he was "never a Reaganite. I voted for everyone else . . . " Davis 
interjects: "So did I." 
</P>
<P>
 Another man stands up and announces: "I have to admit that I couldn't stand 
your parents. But after having met you, the word Reagan will never again have 
such a negative association." 
</P>
<P>
 During a break at the seminar, Suzy Wai sits in the front row and reads a 
tabloid article entitled: "I Tried Everything to Get Michael Jackson Into Bed." 
She was intrigued by the advertisement for the seminar because of the "ritzy 
reputation" of the Reagans. During the 1980s, she says, they were the closest 
thing America had to royalty. Wai, a computer programmer from Westwood, 
confides that she recently read a tabloid article about Davis' breakup with her 
boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Wai leans over and whispers, in a conspiratorial tone, "I don't want to 
embarrass her, but do you think I could ask her what really happened?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Davis never could figure out why her political and social sensibilities were 
so different from her parents'. But she gained some insight, she says 
earnestly, during a "a past life regression" with a Los Angeles channeler. 
(This, at least, is one thing she has in common with her mother -- an interest 
in the psychic world.) While with the channeler, she saw herself in a number of 
past lives, as a soldier on a battlefield, surrounded by fighting, and she kept 
muttering to those around her: "This is so wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've held onto that image and it's given me some insight," she says. "I don't 
think it's an accident who our parents are; I believe we choose them. So maybe 
I chose my parents in order to effect change." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis acknowledges at the seminar that she has been roundly criticized for 
exposing intimate family details. People ask her, can't you just keep this kind 
of information in the therapist's office? How can you live with yourself after 
being so disloyal? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't view what I'm doing as disloyal; I'd be disloyal if my motivation 
were to hurt or to cause pain," Davis says. "I just think that when you work 
through something as difficult as this, you have an obligation to share it with 
others."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; QUAKE SURVIVOR WHO LOST THREE ROOMMATES RETURNS 
TO CLASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just a month after his three roommates died around him, Robert Dorsey, 25, 
went back to classes at Cal State Northridge on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 He still has trouble sleeping, still plays the scenes endlessly in his head: 
his ground-level apartment crushed under two upper stories of the collapsed 
Northridge Meadows complex, his roommates suffocated in their beds only yards 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 The rib he cracked trying to shove himself out from under the fallen ceiling 
is healing. He can walk without crutches on the leg that was compressed so hard 
and so long he thought it would be amputated. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the Jan. 17 earthquake killed 16 of his friends and neighbors at 
Northridge Meadows, Dorsey had survived high-speed motorcycle crashes and a 
fiery car explosion. He survived the Persian Gulf War as an Army 
machine-gunner. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he is the lone survivor of Apartment 104. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his roommates' deaths, Dorsey was eager to get back to his computer 
science and math classes at CSUN, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 College is Dorsey's top priority. In his first semester last fall, he earned a 
4.0 grade point average. He hopes to transfer to UCLA or UC Berkeley in two 
years, and later obtain a master's degree. 
</P>
<P>
 And he feels no guilt, he said, over emerging alive from Apartment 104. 
Trapped himself, there was nothing he could have done to save his roommates, he 
said, and he takes comfort in that knowledge. "Certain events I go through and 
I accept, and then I get on with my life," Dorsey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Discharged last summer after six years in the Army, Dorsey enrolled at CSUN in 
September. He moved into a dorm where he met Manuel Sandoval, 24, a fellow 
computer science major who soon became his best friend. 
</P>
<P>
 By Christmas break, the pair had decided to find a cheaper place to live. 
After checking out dozens of buildings, they settled on Northridge Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 They moved in two days before the quake, joining two other roommates who had 
arrived five days earlier, Jaime Reyes, a 19-year-old CSUN student, and his 
girlfriend, Myrna Velazquez, an 18-year-old Valley College student. 
</P>
<P>
 The night before the quake, Dorsey and Sandoval cooked a chicken dinner and 
relaxed in front of the TV. By 1 a.m. Monday, they were asleep in their 
bedroom, and Reyes and Velazquez were asleep in their smaller room nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 When the quake struck at 4:31 a.m., Dorsey leaped out of bed and ran toward 
the door frame. But the wildly heaving floor pitched him atop a three-foot-high 
metal filing cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 Seconds later, the roof caved in, pinning him helplessly, face-down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was smashed into the filing cabinet like somebody stepping on a Coke can, 
crushed right into it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey had the air knocked out of him and could not breathe for a minute or 
so. Terrified that he would suffocate, he heaved himself a few inches forward, 
yanking his chest off the filing cabinet so he could breathe. He pushed so hard 
he cracked a rib. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as he was feeling a bit safer, a sharp aftershock brought the ceiling 
down more, further constricting his lungs.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was taking half breaths," he said. "And every aftershock after that, I went 
from half breaths to quarter breaths. I realized that if they don't get me out 
of here soon, I'll go from quarter breaths to eighth breaths to no breaths at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 One of his legs, jammed under debris, felt like it had lost circulation. When 
he touched it, he felt nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside on Reseda Boulevard, firetrucks raced by, sirens wailing. But none 
stopped. He realized that the quake probably had wrecked lots of apartment 
buildings, and that he might be trapped for days. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey tried to stay calm. To get excited meant his heart and lungs worked 
faster, and that only produced more pain. But when he thought of his roommates, 
he began to scream. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just kept screaming out their names, saying, 'Talk to me, tell me you're 
alive, tell me you're in good condition,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no replies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell you the truth, I felt jealous. Because I was so sure that I was going to 
die that I was thinking, 'Gee, I wish I could have gone painless and quick like 
that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey heard voices from the sidewalk, people talking and laughing just a few 
yards away. But when he started yelling for help, no one responded. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all stopped talking. It was like bystander apathy. They all stood around 
waiting for somebody else to come over." One woman told him to "stop your 
whining." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, a man told Dorsey that Fire Department rescue crews were en route. 
 
</P>
<P>
 After they arrived, the firefighters worked quickly. But they apparently did 
not realize Dorsey's back was jammed against the ceiling, which they were 
trying to cut through from the apartment above. 
</P>
<P>
 A chain saw slashed through the ceiling next to his head. Dorsey shouted to 
his rescuers that they were in danger of cutting him, and they began slicing 
only part way through the ceiling and then cracking it with sledgehammers. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the ceiling was weakened to the point that Dorsey used his arms and 
back to punch through it. Firefighters hauled him out through an apartment 
window, using a door as a makeshift stretcher. He had been trapped in the 
rubble for 2 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 But within minutes, his body filled with new pain -- from his cracked rib, 
compressed leg and assorted cuts and bruises.  
</P>
<P>
 A doctor examined him and sent him by ambulance to Northridge Hospital Medical 
Center.Dorsey had his chest and leg X-rayed and then, because he had no 
life-threatening injuries, was given crutches and asked to leave. Someone said 
they needed his bed. 
</P>
<P>
 With no money and no shoes, Dorsey took a free hospital shuttle bus to the 
CSUN dorms, hoping to find some shelter. But the dorms were closed.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, another student drove him back to the hospital, where he huddled 
overnight, sleepless, on a small mattress in the lobby. His mother arrived the 
next morning and took him to his parents' home in Petaluma. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey does not expect flashbacks of the quake.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a lot of experience with bad, traumatic things. I've come close to 
death several times," he said. "But I have very, very good coping skills. This 
is just one more thing . . . And I think I can deal with it."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; DRUG 
CONSPIRACY TRIAL OF FORMER DEPUTY OPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During opening statements of the drug conspiracy trial of former Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Deputy Rickey Ross on Monday, a prosecutor portrayed him as a 
member of a narcotics organization who sought to purchase 22 pounds of cocaine 
from undercover officers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ross' attorney contends that he is innocent and those testifying against 
him, a government informant and former Los Angeles Dodger Derrel Thomas, are 
"men of questionable background and character." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross and Thomas were arrested in April, 1992, in a McDonald's parking lot with 
$151,000 in the trunk of Ross' rented car. They were there, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Jane Winston contended, to buy 22 pounds of cocaine from undercover agents 
running a sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney David Herriford said that when Thomas takes the stand, he 
will explain why he was there and why he is not guilty of the drug charges. In 
December, Thomas pleaded no contest to conspiring to buy and sell 22 pounds of 
cocaine. In exchange for testifying against Ross, he will face no more than 
three years in prison.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CARSON; SISTERS HELD 
FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER OF GRANDFATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twin sisters who claim they were abused by their grandfather are being held in 
connection with his attempted murder in their Carson home early Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies say the 21-year-old twins, Marla and Ramona Hidalgo, 
arrived at the Carson sheriff's substation at the same time their grandfather, 
Raymond Hernandez, 73, was filing a complaint on the incident a few hours after 
it occurred.The Hidalgos admitted trying to shoot their grandfather, according 
to deputies, and were arrested for investigation of attempted murder. Arrested 
later was Marcelino Conde, 26, who allegedly provided the women with a handgun 
and knew of their plans. The three are being held in lieu of $500,000 bail 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun misfired and Hernandez was not injured. Deputies did not disclose the 
nature of the alleged abuse. Hernandez told authorities he was a strict 
disciplinarian and had recently warned his granddaughters that they would have 
to move out because they were not following the household rules.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BROKEN HEARTS AS BROWN 
DERBY IS DEMOLISHED

 Wearing brown bowlers and bearing red roses and a mock casket, Hollywood 
preservationists Monday bade farewell to the Brown Derby restaurant on Vine 
Street, where Gable proposed to Lombard, Chaplin mixed it up with his wife, and 
Dietrich stunned the world by strolling into the lobby wearing -- gasp! -- 
slacks. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a Valentine's Day heartbreak for the Hollywood Heritage preservation 
group, which has contended that the eatery should have been renovated rather 
than razed after it was damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Jan. 24 bulldozers began plowing over the restaurant, the first 
building in Hollywood to be demolished because of the quake, and the group 
decided to turn what would have been the restaurant's 65th birthday into a mock 
funeral for one of Hollywood's most recognizable landmarks, with a huge derby 
perched on the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 As the sidewalk shook from passing tractors and the rumble of bulldozers and 
drilling filled the air, many railed against the destruction of so many 
Hollywood monuments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where is management, where is the accountability -- who is responsible for 
saving the true Hollywood?" asked Matthew Lesniak, a photographer and Heritage 
member. "Take a look around: Schwab's Drugstore -- demolished. Pickfair -- 
gone. The Hollywood Canteen -- gone. Don the Beachcomber -- destroyed. The D.W. 
Griffith Studios -- leveled. This policy of demolition is taking the heart out 
of Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant became famous for its proximity to the studios, and as the 
scene of spats among its celebrity clientele. Within its wood-paneled interior, 
press agents congregated for a word with the stars, and gossip columnists Hedda 
Hopper and Louella Parsons held court during lunch hour. Marlene Dietrich 
caused an uproar by walking in wearing slacks. Charlie Chaplin and Paulette 
Goddard engaged in verbal fisticuffs. And Irish regulars Ralph Bellamy, Spencer 
Tracy and Pat O'Brien often tippled past closing time. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant closed in 1985 in a lease dispute and the building quickly 
deteriorated from damage by squatters and fires in 1987, 1990 and 1992. The 
quake proved fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to save the building but the Building and Safety Department declared 
it an imminent hazard, and a threat to public safety," said Councilwoman Jackie 
Goldberg, who has been criticized for not saving the structure. "My office is 
still screaming and yelling to save other buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's funeral brought out the idle, the curious and those with fond 
memories. Richard Whitley, a screenwriter and Hollywood buff, remembers picking 
up his girlfriend from the airport in 1981 and driving straight to the Derby, 
where he proposed in Booth 5, the same one in which Gable proposed to Lombard 
in 1939. After 13 years, the Whitleys are still married. 
</P>
<P>
 "After three weeks, there's still part of the building left. I think it's 
haunted -- a lot of celebrity ghosts don't want it torn down," said Christine 
O'Brien, a Hollywood Heritage member.ADRIAN MAHER

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN PEDRO; GUNMAN 
KILLED BY OFFICER AFTER 3-HOUR STANDOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a three-hour standoff, a 29-year-old San Pedro man was shot and killed 
by a Los Angeles Police Department officer Monday after he came out of his 
apartment waving a handgun, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernesto (Ernie) Frank Aurelio, who lived with his parents in the 1300 block of 
South Leland Street, was pronounced dead at the scene after being hit by a 
single shotgun round.No other shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD spokesman Lt. John Dunkin said officers were called about 11 a.m. by 
Aurelio's parents, who said their son had not slept since Friday and was acting 
strangely. Neighbors and friends said Aurelio had a history of drug use, and 
had recently attended a drug rehabilitation program. Police said he had two 
handguns registered in his name. 
</P>
<P>
 Police evacuated the apartment building. About 2 p.m., Aurelio came out the 
apartment's front door, shirtless and holding a 9-millimeter semiautomatic 
handgun. When he pointed the weapon in the officers' direction, Dunkin said, 
one officer fired, killing him.

LOVE, THEN A LIFE, LOST AMID MISUNDERSTANDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 First, Charles Edward Lovinggood lost his love. Then, on Valentine's Day, he 
lost his life. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, just 20 minutes into the most sentimental of days, Lovinggood, 45, 
of Reseda, telephoned his estranged wife, Marilyn Eileen Lovinggood, also 
45.Police said that upon learning that another man was living at her West Hills 
home, Charles Lovinggood threatened to pay them a visit. 
</P>
<P>
 When he carried out that threat, he got into a fight with the other man, who 
punched him twice in the face, police said. And after his head struck the slate 
floor, he died. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said Lovinggood's jealousy was misplaced. They said Harold Steven 
Cartrett, 29, was just a friend of Marilyn Lovinggood. He had been living at 
her house because his home was damaged during the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to have been a lot of misunderstandings here," said Detective 
Rick Swanston. He said charges have not been filed because Lovinggood 
apparently assaulted his estranged wife before Cartrett punched him. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Lovinggood, who had been separated from Marilyn Lovinggood for nearly 
a year, phoned her shortly after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was angry and said he was going to find out who was living there with her. 
. . . He said he was going to pound the door down," Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lovinggood arrived, Cartrett ordered him to leave the house, Swanston 
said, 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Lovinggood grabbed his estranged wife and "began shaking her 
violently," the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cartrett hit Lovinggood twice in the face. After the second blow, he fell and 
hit his head, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was pronounced dead by paramedics at 12:51 a.m.

OFFICER PASSES POLYGRAPH ON GUNPLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The lawyer for Ted S. Teyechea, one of two Los Angeles police officers accused 
of firing at a California Highway Patrol officer during a drunken shooting 
spree last week, said Monday that Teyechea passed a lie detector test when he 
denied shooting his gun at the officer or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Teyechea and Michael V. Herrera were arrested Wednesday after they allegedly 
fired at a CHP officer who had stopped to write a motorist a ticket. The two 
off-duty LAPD officers reportedly had been drinking earlier that day, and 
investigators later determined that they had fired at least nine shots between 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The policemen were booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on a 
peace officer, but Barry Levin, the lawyer who represents Teyechea, said Monday 
that his client was shown to be "conclusively truthful" when he denied shooting 
at the CHP officer or others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ted is being accused of a crime he did not commit," Levin said in an 
interview with reporters from The Times and Channel 11 TV news. "There is no 
way that a man of Officer Teyechea's background would ever, ever commit the 
crime of shooting at a police officer." 
</P>
<P>
 An official with Intercept Inc., which administered the test, confirmed 
Levin's account of the results. Teyechea recorded a score of 19 in response to 
four questions probing whether he pointed his weapon at a CHP officer or anyone 
else and whether he fired his weapon at an officer or any other person. A score 
of six or higher indicates that a person has answered truthfully, the company 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to LAPD sources, Teyechea and Herrera have told friends that they 
were shooting at street signs and never saw the CHP officer during the 
Wednesday afternoon incident, which prompted an embarrassed Police Chief Willie 
L. Williams to forcefully distance the LAPD from the two men. 
</P>
<P>
 If found guilty of drinking and shooting at signs, Teyechea and Herrera could 
still lose their jobs, but the criminal penalties would be far less severe than 
if they were convicted of assaulting a peace officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Levin would not comment about whether his client had been drinking or shooting 
his gun, but he did say that Teyechea had not been questioned about those 
topics by the polygraph expert. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime of assaulting a peace officer with a deadly weapon carries a 
possible prison sentence of five, seven or nine years, while other possible 
charges such as attempted murder of a peace officer could carry as much as a 
life in prison sentence. On the other hand, illegal discharge of a weapon, a 
logical charge if they did not intend to harm anyone, could result in less than 
a year in custody.

SPREADING A SAFETY NET; SALVATION ARMY PROGRAM AIDS THOSE LEFT HOMELESS BY 
QUAKE 
</P>

 Before the Northridge earthquake, Elizabeth Kasper lived modestly in a 
22-year-old mobile home in Newhall with her husband, Jeff, and their two 
daughters, Joy and Grace. 
</P>
<P>
 After the temblor knocked their trailer from its foundation, the Kaspers not 
only found themselves without a home -- they discovered they were ineligible 
for government housing assistance because their yearly household income, 
$29,500, was too high. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fell through the cracks," said Elizabeth Kasper, 32. "We were not 
low-income enough, but we had no place to live." 
</P>
<P>
 But thanks to a new Salvation Army program, the Kaspers are living better than 
ever -- in a two-bedroom condo in Sylmar with a vaulted ceiling, pool, Jacuzzi 
and a private parking garage -- all for $86 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Project Earth (Earthquake Aid for Relocation and Transitional Housing), 
the Salvation Army is helping to fill a void by leasing condominiums -- most of 
them in the San Fernando Valley -- and offering them for low rents to people 
made homeless by the quake. To qualify, the participants must earn between 50% 
and 80% of the median household income for Los Angeles -- too much money to 
receive government assistance but too little to fend for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, $43,000 is 
the median income for a family of four in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Any family displaced by the quake with a household income less than half the 
local median is eligible for housing subsidies through HUD's Section 8 program. 
But Project Earth coordinator Jerry Hill said thousands of displaced families 
in the Valley do not qualify for Section 8, yet are too financially stretched 
to take a government loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is meant as transitional housing, and anyone who stays in the 
condos longer than three months will pay a considerably higher rent. For a 
two-bedroom condo, the rent would jump from $86.40 to $518 for each of the 
following three months. The deadline for moving out completely is Dec. 31, Hill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was created one week after the earthquake, but it took a while to 
get under way because the Salvation Army had to find apartments to lease. About 
100 people have applied to the program as of Thursday and 18 have been 
accepted, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvation Army has leased 45 condos, all owned by HUD, in Pacoima, Arleta, 
Sylmar, Panorama City, Mission Hills, Canoga Park, Valencia and Van Nuys. They 
intend to lease 100 in all, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 People who call inquiring about Project Earth have usually been referred by 
HUD, the Red Cross, Federal Emergency Management Agency or other agencies 
unable to help them, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The application process involves filling out a one-page form listing the 
applicant's former address and landlord, current job, income and some form of 
identification. If applicants pass a brief review they are accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Once people are accepted into the project, Salvation Army workers try to place 
them at the apartment closest to their former home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sherman Oaks apartment where Gloria Wilson and her mother, Trudie, had 
lived for 17 years was condemned after the quake. They moved into a friend's 
home for two weeks and learned about the program from a FEMA worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had gone to FEMA, went through the whole rigamarole," said Gloria Wilson, 
24, a CSUN graduate student who also works. "We were basically shoved around, 
sent from place to place, and we were finally told that we made too much money 
to be eligible for anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very frustrating. You have no home, and the people who are supposed to 
help you say they can't. There are low-income people, and people who can start 
out again, but most people are like me. We're standard middle-class people. We 
work for a living." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At $31,000, the Wilsons' household income was far too high to qualify for 
government assistance but still put them within Project Earth's limits because 
they are supporting Earl Wilson, Gloria Wilson's retired father who lives with 
them. The three Wilsons are now in a two-story, two-bedroom condo in North 
Hills, and plan to stay there until they have enough money for rent and a 
security deposit somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris and Danielle Beck, who were married just three months ago, had acquired 
only a few joint possessions when the quake destroyed their Saugus apartment. 
Now they are living in a one-bedroom Project Earth apartment in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives us a chance to save a little money and replace some of the things we 
lost," said Chris Beck, 21.

SUSPECT IN FATAL CRASH HAD 2 CONVICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A suspected drunk driver who police said crashed into the car of a woman and 
her two children, killing all three in Long Beach on Sunday, had twice been 
convicted of drunk driving, according to Department of Motor Vehicle records. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Ochoa, 47, of Long Beach, was convicted of drunk driving in Los Angeles 
County in 1988 and in Riverside County in July, 1990.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said he ran a stoplight Sunday evening in Long Beach during a 
high-speed chase and smashed his Cadillac broadside into a Toyota Tercel. 
</P>
<P>
 Vicky Lynn Newberry, 35, and her two sons, Tramell, 6, and Travis, 4, were in 
the Toyota, which was beginning to make a left turn. Newberry and her older son 
died at the intersection of Lakewood Boulevard and Spring Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Travis died at Long Beach Community Hospital, said Scott Carrier, a coroner's 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ochoa slammed into the Newberrys he had a blood-alcohol level of 0.25%, 
more than three times the legal limit for drivers, according to Long Beach 
police. The California legal maximum for blood-alcohol content is .08%. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers from Long Beach and Los Alamitos were attempting to stop Ochoa as he 
fled west on Spring Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses who saw Ochoa before the accident told officers he was weaving 
through traffic and seemed to nod off at the wheel while waiting at 
intersections, said Long Beach Police Officer Margarita DeWitt. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos police attempted to stop Ochoa as he raced through their town, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos police continued the chase into Long Beach, where they were 
joined by at least two Long Beach squad cars, Los Alamos Police Sgt. Arl Farris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the crash occurred, police were about a quarter-mile behind Ochoa because 
they had been stopping at traffic lights, Farris said. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if the collision was caused by the police pursuit, Farris said, 
"There's no real way of telling at this point. We were pretty far behind him." 
</P>
<P>
 Ochoa suffered a fractured sternum and a cut lip. He was taken to Los Angeles 
County-USC Medical Center's jail ward and booked on suspicion of three counts 
of gross vehicular manslaughter while under the influence, DeWitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Newberry's family lived in West Virginia, where Newberry lived 
until moving to California.

 In the dark, with a pillow pulled tight to her ear, a weary Denise Reale 
glared at her snoring husband before trudging to the living room couch. Another 
sleepless night with The Bear.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's sooo loud," she said of the nocturnal rumblings created by Thomas, her 
husband of 14 years. "Our daughter has friends come over for slumber parties 
sometimes, and the next morning they giggle and ask about the bear upstairs. 
It's sort of funny, but it can create a lot of stress, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim Hills couple are not alone in their nightly ordeal. One in four 
Americans is a habitual snorer, and the problem worsens with age. For some it 
is a symptom of a more serious ailment, sleep apnea, but for most it is a 
nettlesome, frustrating wedge between them and their sleeping partners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really can't sleep with him," Denise Reale, 37, said. "If it was once in 
awhile it'd be one thing, but every night. . . . I just can't take it." Luckily 
for the Reales, the bear has gone into hibernation -- a quiet hibernation at 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 The help came in the form of a laser surgery devised in Europe in 1989 and now 
used by a handful of Southland doctors. The technique, called laser-assisted 
uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, involves surgical removal of some tissues in the 
throat to open the airway that causes blockage. 
</P>
<P>
 The laser beam is used during three or four outpatient visits to gradually 
shave down the excess tissue that, in effect, acts like the reed of a musical 
wind instrument when the snorer sleeps. 
</P>
<P>
 For Thomas Reale, 41, a single treatment several weeks ago has yielded 
dramatic results. He still snores, but not as often nor as loud. "It's great, 
just great," his wife said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reale's surgeon, Al S. Aly, has performed the surgery on about 15 patients at 
his Santa Ana and Beverly Hills offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "This technique is infinitely better than the procedure that preceded it," Aly 
said. "For the patient, it's like a visit to the dentist, but certainly less 
painful." 
</P>
<P>
 And less painful then the approach most commonly used to reduce the 
snore-producing tissue. That procedure, where a scalpel is used to carve out 
the area, leaves the patient with intense pain during recovery. "Imagine your 
worst sore throat, and multiply by 20," Aly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Less pain, faster recovery and visible results: It isn't difficult to see why 
there is a waiting list for the process. But the procedure isn't without 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still a new and unverified procedure. I think it will be validated, but 
right now it has more publicity than factuality," says Martin L. Hopp, an ear, 
nose and throat surgeon affiliated with the Sleep Disorders Center at Century 
City Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The hype has surgeons eager to learn more about the procedure, said Dr. Yona 
Tadir, medical director of the Irvine-based Beckman Institute for laser 
surgery, a branch of the UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's spreading like a fire," said Tadir, whose institute has performed the 
surgery on about 50 patients. "It's amazing to see how many doctors are 
interested in adopting this surgery. It's a very promising procedure." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Some experts, however, are concerned that the quick-fix laser process might 
inadvertently encourage people not to investigate the reason they snore -- a 
sometimes important medical determination. 
</P>
<P>
 Loud snoring is sometimes a symptom of sleep apnea, a serious condition in 
which the sleeper stops breathing for dangerous lengths of time. 
</P>
<P>
 While the new procedure is billed as way to help people with sleep apnea, 
several doctors said they are concerned that patients may request surgery 
without first getting a thorough evaluation at a sleep disorders clinic to see 
if they have sleep apnea. Those doctors, still skeptical, also want to see more 
studies verifying the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are studies in France, but we want to see it under our hands. Until we 
do that, I'm not comfortable recommending it, " says Dr. Jeffrey N. Hausfeld, 
medical director of the Sleep Disorders Center at Washington Hospital in 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies by French researchers show a high success rate for people with simple 
snoring and apnea, although the studies have involved only a few apnea 
patients. Side effects -- such as bleeding, infection and swallowing and voice 
problems -- have been minimal, the French researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
 The French studies boast of a 95% improvement rate among 620 patients, and 
results from a survey of 199 New York patients who have undergone the procedure 
found improvement in 80% of cases by the third visit. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Snoring is a common problem that has long defied easy solutions. There are 
more than 300 devices registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office as 
cures for snoring, according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology. But, 
the academy notes, "99% of them work by keeping the snorer awake." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the field of sleep disorders therapy has blossomed during the past 10 
years, there are still no sure-fire treatments for severe snoring or apnea, 
Hopp says. And patients with the worst problems -- an estimated 20 million -- 
are often desperate for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not unusual to have someone come in who says, 'I'm getting divorced 
because I can't sleep with my spouse. I snore too much,' " Hopp says. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been few remedies for people who snore in quaking tones, experts 
say. That's why reports that laser-assisted uvulopalatopharyngoplasty can help 
have generated so much enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 In the laser surgery, done in a series of four to six outpatient visits, the 
surgeon trims the soft palate and the uvula -- the pouch of tissue that dangles 
from the roof of the mouth -- with a precise laser beam. 
</P>
<P>
 The laser is useful because it reduces bleeding and swelling and is less 
painful than traditional surgery. Patients can have a moderate-to-severe sore 
throat for up to six days and usually miss a day or two of work. About four 
weeks of healing time is needed between treatments. According to Sharplan 
Lasers of Allendale, N.J., which manufacturers the laser and teaches the 
procedure to surgeons, studies in France show a dramatic reduction of snoring 
in 85% of 345 patients studied.  
</P>
<P>
 But Hopp and other sleep experts accuse the manufacturer and the media of 
hyping the surgery before American studies are completed. The laser is already 
approved for use in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 An ongoing U.S. study of 300 people indicates that the procedure might benefit 
both sleep apnea patients and people with benign snoring. At St. 
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York, 85% to 90% of those with benign snoring 
experienced a drastic reduction in snoring, and about 90% of those with sleep 
apnea saw an improvement in both snoring and breathing capacity, says Dr. Yosef 
Krespi, director of the hospital's ear, nose and throat department. 
</P>
<P>
 "In patients without apnea, the loudness of the snoring is diminished to a 
degree that they can start moving back into their bedrooms," Krespi says. "In 
patients with apnea, we see tremendous improvement in oxygen intake during 
sleep and a reduction in how many apnea episodes they are having per hour." 
</P>
<P>
 Apnea is usually diagnosed after an evaluation at a sleep disorders clinic 
(the patient is tested during sleep) and is often treated with surgery, 
including a non-laser type of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, which is similar to 
the laser technique but usually involves removing more tissue, Hopp says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a traditional uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, the uvula and soft palate are cut 
back and the tonsils removed to open airways. The surgery is done under a 
general anesthetic, and the patient is hospitalized for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 The surgery is about 50% effective, Hopp says. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some cases after the surgery, the patient still has blockage at the base 
of the tongue," he says. "So we were disenchanted with this operation." 
</P>
<P>
 But the surgery is still performed on patients who are thought to be 
particularly good candidates for it, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The advantage of the laser surgery, Hopp says, is that doctors can check the 
patient after each stage of the surgery to see if it's working, and that 
patients may experience less pain and fewer side effects, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But until the U.S. studies are published, many surgeons urge caution. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to tell our first patients that they are guinea pigs," says Hopp, 
who just started offering the procedure at Century City Hospital. St. John's 
Hospital in Santa Monica and Cedars-Sinai are expected to offer the surgery 
after earthquake repairs are made on their buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say they will not recommend the surgery until more is known about it. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential for scarring that might cause permanent swallowing and speech 
problems is especially worrisome, says Washington Hospital's Hausfeld, although 
the French studies last year showed no problems since. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another concern is that the technique will become so popular that patients 
will demand -- and receive -- it without first getting a thorough evaluation. 
Some patients who have sleep apnea may have the procedure and see a reduction 
in their snoring. But they may still have dangerous apnea, says Dr. Nelson 
Powell of the Stanford University Sleep Disorders Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go in and remove this alarm mechanism -- the snoring goes away -- and 
the patient has not been evaluated properly for apnea, then you've really done 
a disservice," Powell says. But, he says, some patients will hear about the 
laser surgery, seek treatment for their snoring and will find out they really 
have sleep apnea. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some respects, the (publicity) this has gotten will uncover a lot of 
people with bona fide sleep apnea. A good head and neck surgeon will do formal 
study and make sure they are doing the right treatment," Powell says. 
</P>
<P>
 The laser procedure costs from $2,000 to $5,000 and probably will not be 
covered by insurance unless patients can show they are being treated for severe 
apnea that endangers their overall health. 
</P>
<P>
 For chronic snorers such as Thomas Reale, the price is a reasonable one in 
exchange for restful nights and a peaceful relationship. If the procedure 
continues to improve his condition, it could mean the end of The Bear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could rest a lot easier, that's for sure."

FAST FORWARD: EARTHQUAKE BED STILL A SLEEPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sales of earthquake kits, flashlights and batteries, cellular phones and camp 
stoves are measuring high on the retail scale. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been no boom in earthquake beds. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be the aesthetics of one model, the Jon Ward Earthquake Bed, a 
650-pound four-poster inspired by the roll cage on a stock car (View, Sept. 
14). Ward, formerly of Agua Dulce, moved to Texas in December. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without lace and frills, it really didn't look good," says John Lundgren of 
Wertz Brothers Inc. in West Los Angeles. "We had one on the floor at $1,500 for 
about 18 months and finally sold it Wednesday -- for $699 plus tax." 
</P>
<P>
 Price is a deterrent, says Gary Wagner, designer of another crush-proof flop 
featuring eight overhead girders. A king-size version sells at the Brass Bed 
Factory in Van Nuys for $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a 900-pound bed that would take a hit from all directions . . . with 
a support underneath in case you went through a floor, high-shear bolts, joints 
that survived a 20,000-pound test, and that's expensive," Wagner explains. "We 
haven't sold one." 
</P>
<P>
 Apathy. Denial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles is saying 'It's over, let's get on with our lives,' " Wagner 
says. "So why strap down the water heater?" PAUL DEAN

COMMENTARY; CAN ONLY WOMEN BARE THEIR ALL IN SPORTS ILLUSTRATED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 This year, in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, the editors of the 
magazine reveal more than models. 
</P>
<P>
 They reveal a hypocrisy that outraged Canadians, prompted an athletic wear 
company to boycott their magazine and spawned charges of censorship, 
double-standards and misogyny. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the story of how Sports Illustrated -- and its traditional defense of 
the annual swimsuit edition, released last week -- lost all credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Adidas Canada Ltd. was introducing a line of soccer wear and its advertising 
firm devised a catchy ad. It was scheduled to run last spring in Sports 
Illustrated's Canadian edition. But right before press time, a Sports 
Illustrated editor in New York decided that the ad would offend the delicate 
sensibilities of his readers. 
</P>
<P>
 So he killed the ad. And he killed the ad because too much skin was showing. 
Male skin. 
</P>
<P>
 There was nothing graphic or prurient in this advertisement. It was just a 
photograph of 11 members of a semi-pro Canadian soccer club posing in a 
traditional team picture. Yes, the players were nude, but trophies, soccer 
balls and hands covered strategic areas. Above the photo was the slogan: "Your 
Team Will Not Be Taken Seriously If It's Not Wearing Adidas." 
</P>
<P>
 You can see as much of the male anatomy any day at the beach in Santa Monica 
as in the picture. And, of course, most of the swimsuit issue layouts are more 
revealing and more provocative. Even the ads in the swimsuit edition are more 
revealing than the Adidas photo. In this year's issue is a full-page watch 
company ad featuring a close-up of a woman who wears either waxed dental floss 
or a skimpy white thong. 
</P>
<P>
 Adidas was outraged by Sports Illustrated's double standard, said Steve Ralph, 
marketing services manager. The company, he said, is very conservative and 
showed the ad to employees, retailers and consumers before sending it to the 
magazine. No one, Ralph said, found it offensive. In fact, many of Adidas' 
female employees liked the ad so much they posted it on their office walls. 
</P>
<P>
 The female managing editor of Sports Illustrated Canada, Ralph said, "not only 
approved the ad, but she loved it." Then Adidas was told by an advertising 
executive that the managing editor of the U.S. edition, Mark Mulvoy, wanted the 
ad killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, the executive told Ralph, was "the male nudity." 
</P>
<P>
 Adidas executives argued that there is much more nudity in the swimsuit 
edition. But Sports Illustrated would not budge. Appalled by the magazine's 
hypocrisy, Ralph said, Adidas declined to ever again advertise in it. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine's decision so outraged Canadian residents that the incident 
became a cause ce le bre. Polls showed that Canadians overwhelmingly opposed 
the cancellation. Adidas and its ad agency, Young and Rubicam, were deluged 
with calls of support. And columnists and editorial writers across the country 
vilified Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cross-border censorship!" one columnist wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beefcake 0, Cheesecake 1," wrote another. 
</P>
<P>
 A Toronto Star columnist wrote that the "annual swimsuit slobberfest" 
regularly features shots of: "Erect nipples straining through wet translucent 
tops, bare buttocks splayed over sand dunes and shorn pubic areas teasingly 
exposed by thongs that pass for water wear. . . . Female nudity is great for SI 
business, but male nudity is offensive to the tender predilections of the 
company's decision makers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sports Illustrated has managed to parlay jiggle journalism into big bucks. It 
aggressively markets the swimsuit models in cheesecake calenders and videos. It 
hypes the issue so extensively, and it has become so popular, that newsstand 
sales are usually up 100%, with ad rates jacked up. 
</P>
<P>
 When contacted last week about the double-standard charges, Sports Illustrated 
issued a tepid response. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't consider it good business to discuss advertiser-magazine relations," 
said spokesman Roger Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 And Managing Editor Mulvoy, the man who made the decision, the man who heads a 
magazine that attempts to persuade athletes to reveal their innermost thoughts, 
would not reveal his innermost thoughts about why he killed the ad. He declined 
to comment on the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, Sports Illustrated, not content with merely hawking the 
upcoming swimsuit edition, ran a 3,500 word article touting it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The SI swimsuit issue . . . has become part and parcel of our culture, like 
Groundhog Day or spring training. . . . A tradition!" the writer gushed. And, 
in a winking aside, the writer referred to the magazine's "mid-winter 
wickedness." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Every year when the issue hits the streets, a debate commences. Some women's 
groups argue that the layouts are exploitative and offensive. Sports 
Illustrated spokesmen contend that swimwear is merely athletic fashion and 
therefore appropriate in a sporting publication. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the dispute may have been a standoff. But in rejecting the recent 
Adidas ad, the magazine has blown its credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest swimsuit edition, probably in an attempt to assuage critics after 
the Adidas fiasco, features a few shots of models with male water polo players 
in the background. But the men are never seen out of the pool. Tammy Bruce, 
president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Organization for Women, 
says the magazine is "obsessed with keeping male bodies out of the magazine." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yet they attempt to exploit women's bodies at every opportunity," she said. 
"This shows that the swimsuit edition has nothing to do with swimsuits -- it's 
just about exploiting women." 
</P>
<P>
 While Canadians were thoroughly disillusioned with American journalistic 
ethics after the ad was banned, Adidas was able to turn a frustrating 
experience into a beau geste.  
</P>
<P>
 The company created a poster out of the banned ad. All 8,000 copies were 
quickly snapped up, and the profits were donated to the Special Olympics.

SUPPORTERS PUT THEIR HEARTS INTO IT; THE WORLD FANTASY PERFORMERS OF NEW YORK'S 
LE MASQUERADE KICK UP THEIR HEELS AT THE BLACK-TIE, 'HOLLYWOOD NIGHTS' GALA IN 
IRVINE.

 Supporters for the American Heart Assn.-Orange County danced their hearts out 
Saturday at the 13th annual Heart to Heart Gala. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all of the 300 guests who attended the bash at the Hyatt Regency 
Irvine spent the evening on the dance floor, joining members of the New York 
dance troupe Le Masquerade in a tribute to "Hollywood Nights." The 
$200-per-person benefit was expected to net about $100,000 for the heart 
association. Heart Beat 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a typical disease ball," said Heidi Miller, chairwoman of the 
1992 gala, who was in charge of this year's silent and live auctions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether you want to or not, you're on the dance floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Heart to Heart Gala is one black-tie benefit that has no 
long-winded speeches, and guests are never in their seats for long. 
</P>
<P>
 The event owes its high energy to the World Fantasy Performers of Le 
Masquerade, a troupe of dancers, actors and mimes from New York City that has 
performed five other times at the galas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before (Le Masquerade), this was a run-of-the-mill fund-raiser," said Craig 
Beam, immediate past chairman of the heart association's California affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, in keeping with the Hollywood theme, Le Masquerade treated guests 
to a Broadway-style revue. Members dressed in lavish costumes and danced and 
lip-synced to numbers from "Grease," "Fame," "Singing in the Rain" and "Viva 
Las Vegas." In between each number, they got people on the dance floor by 
fanning out among the crowd and pulling guests out of their chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is good heart aerobics," said Tom Sifferman, past gala chairman with his 
wife, LeeAnn. Hurray for Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 To create a Hollywood night, organizers decked the walls of the ballroom with 
Art Deco mirrors and blow-up stills of movie stars. Each table had a silver 
star at the center that held glittering branches, movie reels and a miniature 
Oscar statue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We chose the theme because we wanted to do something glamorous," said JoAnne 
Stewart, event chairwoman, sporting a sparkling strapless black gown. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the men wore tuxedos, with a few paying homage to the Heart Assn. by 
donning red bow ties and cummerbunds. Women wore everything from long formal 
gowns with full skirts to short halter dresses -- one in fire engine red 
chiffon. Patti Wellman, event co-chairwoman, turned heads with her red and gold 
brocade jacket with rhinestone buttons and a long, slitted red skirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bought the fabric from Yves Saint Laurent and had the dress designed for 
me," she said. "I've received so many compliments." 
</P>
<P>
 In between dances, guests enjoyed a heart-healthy dinner of consomme of 
pheasant with wild mushrooms, bibb and red leaf lettuce with Cabernet 
vinaigrette, seafood pasta and, for dessert, an almond tulle basket with fresh 
fruit and berries. 
</P>
<P>
 Many support the heart association because they or their friends and family 
members have been affected by heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father has had two heart attacks," said Don Chou, immediate past chairman 
of the Heart Assn.'s Orange County chapter. "He would not be alive without 
their research and programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those attending were: Olav Bergheim, president of Baxter Healthcare 
Corp., which received the association's Lifeline Achievement Award, and his 
wife, Laila, as well as Jim and Mimi Cora, John and Donna Crean, Dirk and Sally 
DeYoung, Margaret Edwards, Sam Goldstein, Ralph and Eva Mann, Vicki and Rick 
Pene, Joe and Dierdra Piegari, Wayne and Carol Plizga, Sheldon and Mary 
Rubenstein, Peter Stearn and Robert and Maureen Zehntner. KATHRYN BOLD

AN EMOTIONAL DECISION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Single-sperm injection has created excitement among infertile couples, some of 
whom had dropped their plans to have a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is one of the big dilemmas in the community: When do you stop treatment 
or try again?" says Judy Rosen, co-president of the Greater Los Angeles 
RESOLVE, a support and information network for infertile couples. 
</P>
<P>
 "We deal with this issue all the time. For many couples, finances, age and 
emotional issues are factors in their decision," she says. (The single-sperm 
procedure generally adds about $500 to $2,000 to the cost of in-vitro 
fertilization, which averages about $7,500 per attempt.) 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Harris and David O'Connell were among the first in Los Angeles to try the 
technique. O'Connell was treated for testicular cancer 14 years ago, which left 
him sterile. Prior to his cancer treatment, however, he stored sperm in a sperm 
bank. But with a limited quantity of sperm, the couple believe that they must 
use the latest technology to have a baby. Two attempts at artificial 
insemination failed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills couple underwent sperm injection late last year, and Harris 
became pregnant. But she had a miscarriage one month later and now questions 
whether to try again. Both she and her husband are 41. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so astounded I became pregnant," Harris says. "I couldn't believe it. 
For such a severe male infertility factor, this is our only option other than 
to adopt. But it's an uncomfortable position to be in because it is so 
revolutionary and new. I'm nervous about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie, who lives in Palos Verdes, says she and her husband will probably try 
sperm injection later this year. They have a daughter born through traditional 
IVF. But four other attempts at IVF have failed to produce a second pregnancy. 
Because her husband's sperm count is abnormal, the chances are greatly reduced 
that a sperm will penetrate the egg.  
</P>
<P>
 They believe that they are perfect candidates for sperm injection, says 
Debbie, who sought anonymity to protect the couple's privacy. 
</P>

 "I was devastated after the fourth IVF cycle failed," she says. "But since 
then I've heard a lot of hubbub about sperm injection. And it's hard for me to 
give up." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the prospect of sperm injection -- the human selection of the egg and 
sperm that could produce their child -- unnerves her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary to me that they pick up one sperm and that there is no natural 
selection," she says. "I don't want to be the first one to try it." SHARI ROAN

HEALTH WATCH; GETTING A LEG UP ON FUTURE KNEE TROUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your stationary exercise bike has been a lovely home for your hanging 
philodendron. But now the time has come to wipe off the dust balls and work on 
protecting your knee from damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Your knee? 
</P>
<P>
 The knee can only take so much abuse before it throws up its hands and says, 
"All right, already!" 
</P>
<P>
 The trick is in developing strength and flexibility in the quadriceps and 
hamstrings -- the muscles that lead down the leg and around the knee. 
Conditioning them helps protect the knee and can also "atone for past knee 
sins," says James Garrick, director of the center for sports medicine at St. 
Francis Memorial Hospital in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to the exercise bike. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say you should start out at a slow pace. They suggest riding for 20 
minutes three to four times a week at a tension on the bike that challenges but 
doesn't overtire. They also note that you should warm up by riding the bike at 
a low tension, then do the hardest part of the workout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody tries to do the hardest part at the end, but that's when you're 
fatiguing and more likely to hurt yourself," Garrick says.

 Prescription for Happiness: Forget what you've heard about physicians 
regretting their career choices and complaining that being a doctor is a drag. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey of 251 California physicians found that most derive considerable 
intellectual and emotional satisfaction from their work. A majority even say 
doctoring is fun. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, conducted in 1992 by researchers from the University of California, 
Davis School of Medicine, contradicts the widely publicized view that doctors 
are so disgruntled that, if they had it to do over again, they would choose 
another career.

TOUGH ROAD AHEAD FOR L.A. CHAMBER ORCHESTRA; BOARD PRESIDENT CITES AN 
'UNPRECEDENTED CONVERGENCE OF ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA ISENBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These are terrible times for the prestigious Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra. 
Kent Twitchell's huge mural of its musicians may look very sturdy from the 
Harbor Freeway, but the organization billing itself as "the orchestra of the 
21st Century" has been battered by the city's economy, riots and earthquakes 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
 As the orchestra celebrates its 25th anniversary, it does so with nearly empty 
coffers. Concert-goers found last weekend's concerts at Royce Hall and 
Ambassador Auditorium were "deferred" until spring, while management scrambles 
to restructure the season, come up with a replacement for quake-damaged Royce 
Hall and work out credit arrangements with musicians and other creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff and salaries have already been trimmed within the institution's 
$2.3-million budget, and creditors gathered on Friday to hear management's plea 
to hold off action. Orchestra members last week voted to accept a diminished 
concert and rehearsal schedule for the rest of the season, and their union on 
Monday was set to file a grievance for back wages and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We faced an unprecedented convergence of economic and environmental issues," 
said board president Jennifer Diener. "The growth of audiences and gifts simply 
didn't keep pace with the orchestra's growth." 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is a high-quality, well-known musical group that has long been 
attracting subscribers and others to concerts at Ambassador Auditorium in 
Pasadena, the Japan America Theatre downtown and UCLA's Royce Hall on the 
Westside. Drawing heavily on Los Angeles' studio musician pool, the orchestra 
has made 26 recordings and toured both domestically and internationally. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I hear about this, my heart sinks," said Deborah Rutter Card, the 
chamber orchestra's executive director until fall, 1992, when she left for the 
same post at the Seattle Symphony. "I hear orchestras across the country, and I 
know the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra is among the very best. I am very 
distraught by the idea that the chamber orchestra would not exist." 
</P>
<P>
 Formed in 1969, L.A. Chamber Orchestra usually presents 15 to 40 musicians, 
depending on what they're playing, and performs world premieres of new work as 
well as more traditional Mozart and Beethoven concertos and symphonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Like so many arts and other organizations, the orchestra grew and prospered 
through the '80s, adding subscribers, halls and patrons. In 1991, the board 
hired German conductor Christof Perick as its fourth music director, following 
prior leaders Neville Marriner, Gerard Schwarz and Iona Brown.  
</P>
<P>
 Then came all sorts of disasters. First the economy deteriorated, and giving 
patterns changed. Contributed income started sliding, Diener said, and by the 
end of last year had dropped to about $1 million from $1.5 million just two 
years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Next came the 1992 riots, which knocked out two concerts downtown during 
curfew nights and changed traffic patterns enough that orchestra officials 
claim their Japan America audiences never returned to former levels. Concerts 
were postponed, and deficits were increasing.  
</P>
<P>
 "If people are out of work and have their houses shaken by declining real 
estate values or earthquakes, it puts a crimp in their serious outside 
interests," said former board member Nicholas Ciriello, the businessman who is 
leading efforts to reorganize the orchestra, "whether (those people are) 
attending or supporting these events."  
</P>
<P>
 Fund-raising is crucial for performing arts organizations like the Los Angeles 
Chamber Orchestra, whose ticket income in no way covers costs. Even if you sell 
out an all-Vivaldi concert, says Ciriello, "you don't make money. You just lose 
less." 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra's subscribers today number about 2,800, more than double the 
1,300 subscribers of the 1986-87 season, and most of what they hear is 
different from that offered by the Los Angeles Philharmonic or other local 
ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
 "A city like Los Angeles should be able to afford two orchestras, and (L.A. 
Chamber Orchestra) is a fantastic chamber orchestra," said Ernest Fleischmann, 
the Philharmonic's executive vice president and managing director. "Its hitting 
really hard times reflects badly on a city like L.A., which perhaps doesn't 
deserve the musical riches it's got." 
</P>
<P>
 One problem, of course, is who will pay for those riches. Fund-raising that 
was already tough for arts groups in a deteriorating local economy got even 
tougher when riots and earthquakes increased the number of people and 
organizations needing aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Deficits at Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra went from about $100,000 in fiscal 
'91 to an accumulated $465,000 debt the following year, said Diener. That 
number climbed to $600,000 in its fiscal year ended June 30, 1993, and totaled 
nearly $1 million by January, 1994.  
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time the institution has deferred concerts either. 
Financially troubled before, although apparently not to this extent, the 
chamber orchestra indefinitely postponed three programs last season, for 
instance. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive director Erich Vollmer said the orchestra is likely to eliminate its 
concerts at Japan America, which represents about a sixth of its audience 
(compared to 50% at Ambassador and the remaining third at Royce). But neither 
executives nor board members indicate concern their nomadic existence is a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody, however, is denying assorted internal problems. For one thing, while 
Rutter Card left for the Seattle Symphony post in November, 1992, Vollmer was 
not hired until last February to succeed her. 
</P>
<P>
 In what one orchestra member refers to as "naivete, not malice," the 
organization also got behind in crucial payments. While Vollmer declines to 
identify the person responsible, he said he discovered last November that 
regular payments were not being made to some state, federal and union agencies 
beginning in the last quarter of 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 Once the discovery was made, said Vollmer, management notified the state, IRS 
and others and "affected a payment plan." Vollmer and Lewis Levy, counsel for 
Musicians' Union Local 47 here, say the orchestra and the union will meet to 
discuss two unmet payrolls as well as delinquent contributions to union pension 
and other funds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There has been a cash shortage at Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra for about nine 
months, Vollmer said. The orchestra's bank reduced its credit line, he said, 
and they lost a major grant when a key funder changed its giving emphasis. 
Another key funder postponed grant action from fall to spring.  
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra's tiny staff of 10 lost one position, the development director, 
and remaining staff salaries were cut 5%. A press release dated Feb. 7 
announced that board members pledged $150,000, and two anonymous donors pledged 
an additional $100,000 a year for five years "contingent upon a satisfactory 
financial plan and matching commitments of $150,000 a year in additional 
funding." 
</P>
<P>
 The board is also "actively seeking angels," said president Diener, who 
estimates she's talking with about two dozen potential major donors. The 
orchestra is also trying to find a new hall to replace Royce in April for the 
American premiere of the restored Charlie Chaplin silent film classic "The Gold 
Rush"; the chamber orchestra was set to accompany the film with its original 
score as a major orchestra fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Postponed concerts have tentatively been rescheduled for late April, Vollmer 
said, but finances could indeed affect programming changes as well. 
Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony No. 2, Op. 38, requires two or three extra 
rehearsals, conductor Perick said, and may be replaced to save extra rehearsal 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, concerts set for Feb. 24 and Feb. 27 at Ambassador Auditorium will 
go on as planned, according to an orchestra spokesman. The Feb. 25 concert at 
Japan America Theatre has been canceled, he said, and ticket holders are being 
asked to exchange their tickets for the Ambassador concerts. The remainder of 
the season is still being discussed, and they hope to announce plans by the end 
of the week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks continue too with musicians and other creditors. While only eight of 118 
creditors notified about last Friday's meeting actually attended, Vollmer said 
those attending agreed to wait for their money until July, and approved of the 
orchestra telling other creditors of their agreement with encouragement to do 
the same. The orchestra's bank had already agreed to wait through June 30, he 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very hopeful that it will all work out and the orchestra go ahead and 
continue," said violinist Jennifer Woodward, chair of the orchestra committee 
and a 14-year Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra veteran. "We love the orchestra a 
lot, and we feel it's very valuable for the community."

RAP FINDS A SUPPORTER IN REP. MAXINE WATERS; POP MUSIC: THE CONGRESSWOMAN 
ALIGNS HERSELF WITH 'OUR CHILDREN' AND DEFENDS THEIR 'NEW ART FORM.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As the debate over the social impact of gangsta rap spills over to Capitol 
Hill hearings, the controversial musical genre has picked up a powerful new 
ally: U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a foolhardy mistake to single out poets as the cause of America's 
problems," the veteran Los Angeles legislator and one of the nation's most 
influential elected African American women said on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are our children and they've invented a new art form to describe their 
pains, fears and frustrations with us as adults. Just because we don't like the 
symbols they use or the way they look, we should not allow that to cause us to 
embark on a course of censorship." 
</P>
<P>
 Waters, a Democrat whose district includes much of South-Central Los Angeles, 
faced off Friday against gangsta rap critics in Washington at a House of 
Representatives subcommittee hearing called to explore the alleged link between 
hard-core hip-hop and crime. A similar Senate judiciary subcommittee hearing 
will be held Feb. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Disagreeing with a growing number of black church leaders, feminists and 
politicians who believe gangsta rap glorifies violence and promotes misogyny, 
Waters has been meeting with key African American executives in the music 
industry to discuss their concerns over the threat of government intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Rap impresario Russell Simmons applauds Waters' efforts to counter the 
anti-gangsta rap views espoused in recent months by other prominent African 
American figures including C. DeLores Tucker, chair of the Washington-based 
Political Congress of Black Women, and the Rev. Calvin Butts, pastor of 
Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people would like to build a wall around the ghetto to keep the rappers 
quiet," said Simmons, the CEO of Rush Communications, whose Def Jam Records has 
released controversial albums. "But Maxine understands the conditions that 
trigger the rage in the music. I've got news for the people who want to shut 
rap down: It ain't going to happen. Because whether they like it or not, this 
is art and it's protected by the First Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over gangsta rap's social impact intensified last year following 
the arrests of some of the genre's biggest stars on charges ranging from murder 
to assault. (Tupac Amaru Shakur was convicted Thursday in Los Angeles for 
battery in one of four cases pending against him in three states. Snoop Doggy 
Dogg is expected to face trial for murder in Los Angeles in March.) 
</P>
<P>
 As sensitivity to the issue heightened, several radio stations across the 
nation -- including Inglewood's black-owned KACE-FM -- pulled the plug on 
potentially offensive songs. Eyebrows in the multimillion-dollar industry were 
raised last month when the owner of one such station was congratulated for 
banning rap in a private letter from Reed Hundt, chairman of the Federal 
Communications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Political Congress of Black Women applauds such moves and 
endorses government restrictions on gangsta rap. Tucker's organization was 
instrumental in encouraging Illinois Democrats Rep. Cardiss Collins and Sen. 
Carol Moseley-Braun to convene this month's anti-rap hearings on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker and Butts are not only calling for rappers to quit creating violent, 
misogynistic songs but also for the major record conglomerates to stop making 
their music available at mainstream record outlets in shopping malls and 
discount centers across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have declared war against gangsta rap," said Tucker, who spoke at Friday's 
hearing. "If the record industry doesn't want to clean itself up, then we'll 
get the government to step in and help them out. We aim to put a stop to the 
distribution of these derogatory negative stereotypical images by any means 
necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Waters, who has sponsored many bills promoting women's rights and worked for 
decades with gang members and church groups to reduce crime in urban areas, 
defended the right of rappers to express their rage. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I find some of the language offensive and hard on the ears, I didn't 
first hear the words whore and bitch from Snoop," Waters said. "It's part of 
the culture. These songs merely mimic and exaggerate what the artists have 
learned about who we are (as a society). And while it is unacceptable to refer 
to any person in derogatory terms, I believe rappers are being used as 
scapegoats here." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government has paid little attention to popular lyrics since 1985 
when Tipper Gore, wife of then-Sen. Al Gore and founder of the Parents Music 
Resource Center, pushed for Senate hearings that pressured the music industry 
five years later to reluctantly introduce a voluntary labeling system to 
identify "explicit" albums. 
</P>
<P>
 The uproar surrounding Miami rap group 2 Live Crew's 1990 obscenity trial 
prompted dozens of state legislatures to attempt to enact restrictions on 
controversial music, but all failed in part due to lobbying by the music 
industry's Washington lobby group, the Recording Industry Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
 The association's CEO, Jay Berman, said his group is closely monitoring the 
current anti-rap backlash and is prepared to finance the battle against 
potential censorship threats looming on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I see it, this isn't just a constitutional issue this time around," 
Berman said. "Rap music has empowered an entire new generation of successful 
young black entrepreneurs. I think some people are more afraid of that than the 
music." 
</P>
<P>
 Waters agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It scares the hell out of people when young black males get aggressive," she 
said. "Before rap, there was no other platform for talented people like Snoop 
or Ice Cube or Latifah to speak their minds. These are artists with a message 
and they're forcing America to listen. It isn't just free speech that we're 
talking about defending here, it's a social movement. And that's what people 
can't stand to confront."

DEFYING RECESSIONS, RIOTS AND DISASTERS; ART: GALLERY OWNER SUE SPAID IS AMONG 
THE NEW CROP OF YOUNG ART DEALERS WHO ARE OPENING DOORS FOR L.A.'S LATEST 
GENERATION OF EMERGING TALENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUNTER DROHOJOWSKA-PHILP, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In her L.A. gallery's cluttered office, Sue Spaid is hunkered over the 
telephone with the editor of a magazine of art world gossip. She's raving about 
the turnout for her artist Carole Caroompas' show at the SoHo gallery P.P.O.W. 
She hints that all the truly important collectors and writers were in 
attendance despite competition from a reception for the more famous artist 
David Salle at the posh Larry Gagosian Gallery. Her remarks are impertinent, 
daring and typical of the upstart gallery owner. "I was just generating some 
hysteria," she explains with a naughty laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Spaid is one of L.A.'s new crop of young art dealers, which also includes 
Richard Telles and Kim Light with their eponymous galleries, TRI's Rory Devine, 
1301's Brian Butler and Food House's Randy Sommer. Seemingly undeterred by 
recessions, riots and natural disasters, these dealers have opened galleries to 
support emerging talent. They are showing the latest generation of art-school 
graduates as well as 40-something artists who may have been overlooked in the 
delirious 1980s. They take pride in championing Los Angeles artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Spaid opened her storefront gallery at 7454 1/2 Beverly Blvd. in 1990 and 
quickly gained an audience among artists, critics and the more adventuresome 
collectors. Her most noteworthy campaign has been on behalf of Caroompas, an 
artist who has had an influential and devoted following but whose work was long 
considered too overtly sexual and difficult for galleries coping with the 
effects of the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Spaid is a willing fan. "I'm obsessed with art that has an equal blend of 
style and content," she says. "To me, beauty is not about appearance, beauty is 
an incomparable task." 
</P>
<P>
 Caroompas says she was willing to be without a gallery for five years, waiting 
for someone who would be truly dedicated to her style of work. She recalls that 
one dealer admired her paintings, which are often about issues of gender and 
representation, but urged her to "get rid of the penises." Caroompas compares 
such a response to Spaid. "If Sue believes in something, she really goes for 
it. She brought back a lot of visibility for me. She's not looking at it as a 
sale but as the building of a career." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Caroompas was among the first to join the gallery, her first show 
wasn't until June of 1992. Spaid uses this example to explain her system of 
"targeting" a specific audience for an artist's work. "I spent six months 
planning Carole's show. I must have sent out 40 sets of slides contacting 
people in New York like gallery owners, museum people and critics. I feel like 
when the show opens, it's almost too late." 
</P>
<P>
 Spaid's efforts led indirectly to Caroompas' inclusion in last year's biennial 
exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, and to the commitment 
from P.P.O.W. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my biggest successes has been getting my artists shows in New York," 
Spaid says. "I try to find matches of personalities and styles. All the L.A. 
dealers told me that I would never be able to get the New York dealers to pay 
me a percentage for showing my artists and every one of them has done it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such efforts have paid off. Her artists Nancy Evans and Carter Potter are now 
represented by respected New York galleries Joe Fawbush and Jose Freire, 
respectively. And she reports another achievement with pride: "All but one of 
my artists have been in museum shows in the last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Spaid speaks in the rapid, no-nonsense tones of big business. The shadowy 
euphemisms of gallery artspeak are mercifully missing from her forthright 
demeanor. A woman with sharp blue eyes and a healthy flush in her cheeks, she 
carries herself with a bouncy, electric impatience as though enthusiasm were 
coursing through her veins. While many art dealers share her passion, few have 
her business experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Spaid's resume reads like the fast lane of a freeway forced onto an 
unpredictable detour. Her earliest years were spent in Saudi Arabia, where her 
father worked as a petroleum engineer. Her family indulged in European 
vacations and she remembers the visits to art museums as an early influence. 
After earning degrees in chemical engineering and economics from the University 
of Texas in Austin, Spaid moved to Manhattan where she worked at a series of 
securities firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1986 and 1988, Spaid was a broker of international bonds for the 
British firm S. G. Warburg Securities. The surprise turn-off took place when 
she found herself developing "a huge addiction." To art. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Spaid moved to Los Angeles to promote and sell a calculator she had 
programmed to figure percentages on junk bonds. That market collapsed three 
months after her arrival. Fortunately, she had made a one-year commitment to 
Gary Kornblau to work as advertising director for the journal Art Issues. 
Simultaneously, she threw herself into writing about art on a free-lance basis, 
a career that pays only nominally better than minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
 Spaid was undaunted. "It seemed the galleries here were only showing New York 
and European artists. I had a dedication to create something in L.A. that I 
could export to New York and Europe. A lot of L.A. dealers made a compromise by 
importing so much. What do they get in return?" Spaid convinced a friend in New 
York to back her gallery with a stipend of $3,000 a month. When she opened in 
June of 1990, she was 28 years old. After eight months, the backer left Spaid 
to do it on her own. 
</P>
<P>
 To support the gallery, she took a series of part-time jobs, and she still 
rides the bus to work. "What I do is more important than the glamour of being 
an art dealer," she says. For Spaid, collecting art is a way of supporting a 
view of what the culture should be. Yet, she believes in art collecting as 
long-term investment. "If you're a rich person, you're better off buying art 
than pretending to make some rate of return off a gallery as a business. My 
artists' prices have outperformed the stock and bond markets. The people in the 
art world who make money are the people who buy art."

WEEKEND BOX OFFICE; 'ACE' ACES THE COMPETITION AGAIN

 Even inclement weather in the East did not stop "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective," 
the family farce starring Jim Carrey, from nabbing impressive box-office 
returns for the second weekend in a row. Running a distant second was "The

list in only its second weekend.

ENFANT SAVANT; BOY, 11, WINS NATIONAL HONORS FOR ENTRY IN POSTER CONTEST TO 
PROMOTE READING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BRAZIL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He expounds on the virtues of Dickens and Twain. He actually wants a new 
dictionary. And he knocks fright writer Stephen King for being too gory. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which would be unremarkable except that Jonathan Westerfield is 11. 
He's supposed to like "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure," not "The Adventures 
of Huckleberry Finn." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing there in his size 6 1/2 Charles Barkley Air Max sneakers at the Boys 
and Girls Club, where he is itching to return to a pickup basketball game, 
Jonathan takes a little time out to shed some light on the subject of 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reading is fun," he shrugs. "Even if your life is full of sadness, reading 
can bring you happiness." 
</P>
<P>
 That is vintage Westerfield, a Kierkegaard-in-the-rough who sees the world 
through the untainted eyes of a child, but who also has a knack for leavening 
answers to the simplest queries with sage observations. They are attributes 
that have recently helped earn him national distinction. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan, the product of a single-parent home whose mother and older sister 
bred in him a love for tales, recently became one of 50 young people nationwide 
singled out for honors in a contest sponsored by Reading Is Fundamental, a 
Washington-based group that promotes the benefits of books. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of schoolchildren from across the country submitted posters to the 
contest, depicting the importance of books in people's lives. Jonathan's entry 
-- done with dark and dreary water colors -- depicted an elfin, shoeless boy 
kneeling before a trash bin and reading a tome he had fished from the garbage. 
In the background: the skyline of a dark, forbidding city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I chose a lot of gloomy blues and grays," Jonathan says. "It's a little 
homeless boy, it's a slum. The message? It means that reading can be fun for 
all people . . . even if you have no home or anything or anyone to turn to." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, Jonathan's mother, Marie Angers, and workers at the Boys and 
Girls Club, where Jonathan goes every day after school, swear Jonathan hatched 
the idea and crafted the piece himself. In fact, his recognition comes as no 
surprise to those at the club, where he has distinguished himself as somewhat 
of a reader-artist-philosopher savant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jon can come up with some really amazing things sometimes," says Erin 
Madeiros, the club's educational director. "He was talking about his sister the 
other day -- she was having a problem of some sort and he was doing something 
to help her out, and Jon said, 'Well, that's OK. She's family, and there's 
nothing more important than family.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Most 11-year-olds don't talk like that," Madeiros says. 
</P>
<P>
 So disturbing and provocative was Jonathan's poster that the Boys and Girls 
Club, which chose local entries to submit to the national contest, nearly 
withheld his submission. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all thought it was the best one, but it was pretty heavy," Madeiros says. 
"We thought they would be looking for the cute 7-year-old's drawing with bright 
colors." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Jones, one of six judges in the national contest, viewed 4,000 entries 
over a span of two years. He says Jonathan's, by far, stands out as most 
memorable. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the others were butterflies and bright colors and flowers and blue sky," 
says Jones, creative director at a Washington-area art design studio. "His was 
from the heart. It was like, if you live in the ghetto, reading is your way 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan's portrayal of a child with limited means addresses a subject matter 
with which he is not entirely unfamiliar. While Jonathan's mother says she has 
provided him, his three brothers and sisters, all in their 20s, and an adopted 
sister with a home filled with love, theirs has otherwise been a mostly 
no-frills existence. The older children have chipped in to help pay the bills. 
Child support from Jonathan's father pays for his "fancy tennis shoes," his 
mother says. And fortunately for Jonathan, he can get free books through the 
Boys and Girls Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a month, Jonathan and his mother make sandwiches that their church passes 
out to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 If art is Jonathan's dalliance, reading is his passion. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was like 5, my mom would read me Encyclopedia Brown books," he 
remembers, referring to the series of children's mystery stories. "And my 
sister Kelly -- she read like two books a day growing up." 
</P>
<P>
 By his own tally, the Imperial Middle School sixth-grader now reads four books 
a week, although some are "those 49-page books by Judy Blume which I finish in 
a day," he confesses. 
</P>
<P>
 He is familiar with, and can analyze, the works of a number of authors many 
11-year-olds wouldn't know from a distant cousin. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Mark Twain, Jonathan says: "When he writes a book, he really gets into it. 
Like if somebody is in pain, Twain writes that he's in pain so bad his eyes are 
'glistening with fear.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Of Charles Dickens: "Sometimes he uses a lot of details, so sometimes it's 
hard to understand what he's trying to say, but it gets your mind working." 
</P>
<P>
 Of James Knowles' "The Story of King Arthur": "The lesson is, don't ever 
underestimate somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 And of John Grisham's best-selling novel, "The Firm": "It was really tense and 
thrilling." 
</P>
<P>
 Did he see the movie? 
</P>
<P>
 "Why? I read the book," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His toughest criticism is reserved for horror story writer Stephen King: "He 
just goes overboard. Like with 'Cujo,' it was just too much. It's impossible 
for a dog to go crazy and go man-hunting. I didn't even get through it. I was 
disgusted with it. I was sick. He talked about blood squirting everywhere and 
guts showing. It was gross." 
</P>
<P>
 But lest you think Jonathan is a bookworm, or a geek, in the lexicon of his 
age group, that does not appear to be the case. 
</P>
<P>
 He watches the decidedly low-brow "Beavis and Butt-head." He owns a boogie 
board. He can rattle off sports statistics about professional basketball stars 
Shaquille O'Neal and Michael Jordan, and possesses a card collection that 
includes All-Stars Sean Kemp and Dominique Wilkins. "When they slam dunk, they 
look really cool," he says, sounding every bit his age. 
</P>
<P>
 He also plays video games, though he limits himself to a half-hour a day. "I 
used to spend three hours a day, but one day I heard that Sonic the Hedgehog 
will give you seizures if you play it too much, so I cut back," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, says Robert Martinez, Boys and Girls Club program director, 
"Jon comes up with things out of the blue, weird things really, that you don't 
think most 11-year-olds would come up with." On the other hand, Martinez says, 
"he can be an 11-year-old and mess around like any other kid." 
</P>
<P>
 As if to illustrate that very point, Jonathan relates that he recently 
attended a Mighty Ducks hockey game, where he, upon seeing the team mascot Wild 
Wing frolicking in the crowd, decided he wanted to be a mascot when he grows 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 When told that your garden-variety sports mascot typically doesn't make a big 
salary, he muses, "Happiness is better than money, so I don't care about money. 
You can get money from an envelope, but you can't get happiness from an 
envelope." 
</P>
<P>
 Ahh. The world according to Westerfield.

FATAL CRASH SUSPECT HAS DRUNK-DRIVING RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A suspected drunk driver who led police on a chase from Los Alamitos to Long 
Beach, where police said he struck and killed a woman and her two sons, had 
twice been convicted of drunk driving, according to Department of Motor Vehicle 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Ochoa, 47, of Long Beach, was convicted of drunk driving in Los Angeles 
County in 1988 and in Riverside County in July, 1990.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said he ran a stoplight Sunday evening in Long Beach during a 
high-speed chase and smashed his Cadillac broadside into a Toyota Tercel. 
</P>
<P>
 Vicky Lynn Newberry, 35, and her two sons, Tramell, 6, and Travis, 4, were in 
the Toyota, which was beginning to make a left turn. Newberry and her older son 
died at the intersection of Lakewood Boulevard and Spring Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Travis died at Long Beach Community Hospital, said Scott Carrier, a coroner's 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ochoa slammed into the Newberrys he had a blood-alcohol level of 0.25%, 
more than three times the legal limit for drivers, according to Long Beach 
police. The California legal maximum for blood-alcohol content is .08%. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers from Long Beach and Los Alamitos were attempting to stop Ochoa as he 
fled west on Spring Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses who saw Ochoa before the accident told officers he was weaving 
through traffic and seemed to nod off at the wheel while waiting at 
intersections, said Long Beach Police Officer Margarita DeWitt. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before the 8:20 p.m. collision, Ochoa had been seen driving his car 
erratically in Los Alamitos, police said. Ochoa hit one car and then continued 
driving, said Los Alamitos Police Sgt. Arl Farris. 
</P>
<P>
 The motorist whose car was hit called 911 on his cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos police attempted to stop Ochoa as he raced through their town, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 They continued the chase into Long Beach, where they were joined by at least 
two Long Beach squad cars, Farris said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the crash occurred, police were about a quarter-mile behind Ochoa because 
they had been stopping at traffic lights, Farris said. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if the collision was caused by the police pursuit, Farris said, 
"There's no real way of telling at this point. We were pretty far behind him." 
</P>
<P>
 Ochoa suffered a fractured sternum and a cut lip. He was taken to Los Angeles 
County-USC Medical Center's jail ward and booked on suspicion of three counts 
of gross vehicular manslaughter while under the influence, DeWitt said. He is 
scheduled for arraignment today. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Newberry's family lived in West Virginia, where Newberry lived 
until moving to California.

2 MAYORS PITCH WEDAA DEAL; POLITICS: COUNTY AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT BOARD MEMBER 
SAYS HE WOULD AGREE TO COMPROMISE THAT ALLOWS HIM TO FINISH TERM IF HE CONSENTS 
TO STRICT CONDITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying the debate over Orange County's representative to the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District "has lingered too long," two mayors on Monday sent 
letters to every counterpart in the county proposing to let him remain in the 
job until November -- if he agrees to strict conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly and Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young, who "have been 
consistent critics" of Henry W. Wedaa as anti-business and for his stances on 
protecting air quality, offered a compromise Monday between "sacking" him later 
this week or reelecting him. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa represents Orange County cities on the AQMD board of directors. He has 
announced that he will not seek reelection to the Yorba Linda City Council in 
November, which means he will automatically leave the AQMD when his council 
term ends. 
</P>
<P>
 But last month, Wedaa failed to win enough votes from the county's mayors to 
retain his seat on the AQMD board until then. In the complex voting system, the 
15 of 29 votes Wedaa received was well short of the required two-thirds 
majority of cities, which also must represent two-thirds of the county's 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 Another meeting of the Orange County League of Cities is scheduled for 
Thursday. Under a new state law, if the mayors cannot agree to retain Wedaa or 
agree on a replacement by March 1, the county will not have a member on the 
AQMD board. 
</P>
<P>
 The "halfway position" proposed by the two mayors would require Wedaa to 
promise to honor his commitment not to run for reelection to the council. It 
also would require that he provide his undated resignation from the AQMD to the 
chairman of a new, seven-member Air Quality Steering Committee of Orange County 
city council members. Wedaa would be obligated to accept as "binding" consensus 
positions of the steering committee. 
</P>
<P>
 While the actual membership of the proposed steering committee would be left 
to the League of Cities Steering Committee, the two mayors suggest as members 
"dedicated individuals like Bill Mahoney of La Habra, John Cox of Newport 
Beach, and Paula Werner of Irvine," with Mahoney acting as interim chair until 
the appointments are made and holding Wedaa's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa, who has served on the AQMD for six years, confirmed that he agreed with 
the compromise, saying the final details were worked out Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see anything wrong with the deal," he said. "It's good for all of us. 
We get a lot people involved in air quality issues. I'm a strong supporter of 
having this air quality steering committee, for example." 
</P>
<P>
 The two mayors wrote that the deal includes a "commitment that he will lead an 
effort to untangle the complex and confusing relationship between the AQMD, the 
Southern California Assn. of Governments, and county transportation agencies." 
</P>
<P>
 "With Hank Wedaa's agreement to these conditions -- and he has told us he can 
accept these conditions -- Anaheim and Santa Ana will change our votes and 
support Henry Wedaa for the South Coast Air Quality Management District Board 
of Directors at the League of Cities meeting on" Thursday, Daley and Young 
wrote the other mayors. "To preserve harmony in the league and to put this 
issue to rest, we urge you to join us." 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach Mayor Ann Christoph, who backed Wedaa in earlier votes, said that 
the compromise "will interfere with his independence to some degree, but if 
he's agreed to do it, that's his prerogative. It's good to have him continue as 
chairman. Something had to give to relieve the impasse." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the AQMD's rulings that has been extremely unpopular requires companies 
in Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties with more than 
100 workers to set up programs encouraging employees to car pool, take mass 
transit or use other means to get to work. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-year-old rule has been criticized for making thousands of businesses 
spend large amounts of money to design elaborate ride-sharing plans. 
Collectively, employers in the four-county area spend about $160 million a year 
on these plans, according to a recent study done for the AQMD. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the AQMD formed a task force to explore new ways to remove single 
commuters from the region's roads. Wedaa said that the task force would look 
for less costly and coercive methods to get commuters to leave their cars at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 As "consistent critics of Hank Wedaa" who have "advocated his removal," the 
two mayors wrote, "we are skeptical of his recent pro-city and pro-business 
positions, which we believe are at odds with his performance over the past few 
years. But, in recent times, Hank has really worked to mend fences. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are concerned that if he is simply appointed, the pro-city/pro-business 
Hank will disappear and the anti-city/anti-business Hank will return. If the 
pressure of immediate removal from his post as chairman is taken away, we fear 
Hank will slip back into his old ways. So, before we can agree to support Hank, 
we need assurances he will remain on the straight and narrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also believe that there is value in healing old wounds and ending a 
conflict that has divided the League of Cities for months. This debate over 
Hank Wedaa and AQMD has lingered too long. It should end with a well-reasoned 
compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 Because "the ink is barely dry" on the letters, Mayor Young said in an 
interview that "we have not gotten any feedback that I'm aware of." 
</P>
<P>
 However, given the large populations of Anaheim and Santa Ana, Young said he 
felt this agreement would push Wedaa "over the top" in Thursday's voting.

STATE PANEL CLEARS HURTT ON COMMON CAUSE CHARGE; POLITICS: FPPC REJECTS 
WATCHDOG GROUP'S COMPLAINT THAT THE SENATOR VIOLATED CAMPAIGN FINANCING LIMITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Fair Political Practices Commission has rejected a complaint against 
state Sen. Rob Hurtt by a political watchdog group that argued the Orange 
County Republican and two political organizations he helped form violated 
campaign contribution limits. 
</P>
<P>
 California Common Cause asked the FPPC in October to investigate whether Hurtt 
(R-Garden Grove) and the groups circumvented the law by contributing $7,500 to 
a Republican candidate in a special election last fall for Northern 
California's 4th Senate District. 
</P>
<P>
 But the FPPC said in a letter made public Monday by Common Cause that Hurtt 
had not violated any regulations and the case would be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt, who had expressed confidence since the complaint was filed that he 
would be exonerated, responded by suggesting Common Cause was on an ideological 
campaign to discredit Republicans -- and that the group owed him a public 
apology. 
</P>
<P>
 "They took a pretty direct potshot and they were proven wrong," Hurtt said. 
"It's pretty discouraging when anyone can file a frivolous complaint like this 
and get a headline." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Holton, Common Cause executive director, said her organization has no 
plans to apologize to Hurtt and suggested the FPPC decision would cause 
problems in future special elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "We frankly are still very disturbed by Rob Hurtt's actions," Holton said. 
"They may be technically legal, but we think they violate the spirit of state 
campaign finance law. We stand by our position." 
</P>
<P>
 Holton also denied that her group, which has long pushed for reforms of the 
state's campaign finance regulations, is out to sabotage the GOP. "I think if 
Mr. Hurtt asked Democrats, he'd discover that they find us just as 
objectionable as Republicans do," Holton said. "We figure we're doing our job 
when both sides are angry at us." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt, a wealthy businessman who owns a Garden Grove manufacturing plant, was 
swept into office last year on a vow to elect more Republicans. Bolstered by 
alliances with such wealthy businessmen as Howard Ahmanson of Irvine, Hurtt has 
talked of bankrolling candidates in hopes of wrenching the Legislature from the 
Democratic Party and boosting himself to a leadership position. 
</P>
<P>
 A first step was the race for the 4th Senate District, where Hurtt supported 
conservative businessman Maurice Johannessen, who marched to easy victories in 
an Aug. 31 primary and Nov. 2 runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The race also prompted the complaint from Common Cause. The watchdog group 
argued that two political organizations -- Allied Business PAC and Citizens for 
Change -- should have been registered with the state as political action 
committees controlled by Hurtt, who wields "significant influence" over both. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Hurtt's hand, Common Cause said, the groups violated a state ban on 
transferring money to a candidate from a political organization controlled by 
an elected official. Allied Business PAC contributed $2,500 to Johannessen in 
August and another $2,500 in September. Citizens for Change gave him $2,500 in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 Common Cause also charged that Citizens for Change should be registered as a 
"sponsored committee" of Allied Business PAC because it is funded entirely by 
the political group and two Allied members. As such, a $2,500 contribution from 
Citizens for Change should have been aggregated with those made by its sister 
organization, meaning they exceeded the $2,500 limit for donations to 
candidates from political action committees, Common Cause argued. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan L. Bobrow, an FPPC counsel, said in a letter to Holton that the agency 
had found no evidence Hurtt, who resigned from Allied's executive committee 
before taking office, controlled the political group.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; U.S.-RUSSIA EXCHANGE IS FROM HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The class project Monday at Bonita Canyon School was to turn pink and red 
pieces of construction paper into "Valentine's Day mailboxes." 
</P>
<P>
 But 12-year-old Sasha Salnikov was distracted by something else. While others 
dutifully cut the colorful paper into hearts, Salnikov sat transfixed in front 
of the classroom's personal computer, gently tapping the keyboard and watching 
the screen intently. 
</P>
<P>
 Salnikov's classmates seemed to understand his intense interest. He is one of 
13 students visiting Orange County from St. Petersburg, Russia, as part of a 
two-week exchange program. 
</P>
<P>
 During their stay, the Russian students will regularly attend classes at 
Bonita Canyon School and stay with families in the area. In turn, the Russian 
teacher accompanying them will give Bonita Canyon students Russian lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitors said their first trip to the United States was both a cultural 
and climatic shock. On Monday, some members of the Russian entourage were 
dressed in shorts and joked about the weather in St. Petersburg, where it 
dipped to 9 degrees below zero. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very good school. The computers here are very good," Salnikov said. 
"It's been fun here." 
</P>
<P>
 The students from the 2nd Street St. Petersburg Gymnasia have been 
communicating with Bonita Canyon students since 1990, when Irvine parents 
donated about $2,300 to purchase an Apple computer for the Russian school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was our first computer, so everyone was very excited about it," said 
Tatyana Guryeva, the Gymnasia teacher who traveled with the students to Orange 
County. "People were astonished by it. Everyone wanted to use it." 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Petersburg Gymnasia, which opened in 1805, is one of the first public 
schools in Russia. The school has about 1,000 students and has traditionally 
specialized in the teaching of foreign languages. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonita Canyon parents are providing room and board for the visitors, but the 
Russian students and their families had to pay for the plane tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 One mother sold her wedding ring so her child could make the trip, and others 
borrowed the money, Guryeva said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parents know how important it is to help the development of their kids," 
Guryeva said. "They know how important it is to develop attitudes between our 
two countries." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonita Canyon teacher Clyde A. Dodge III, the exchange program coordinator, 
said a goal is to help students from both countries better understand each 
other's culture and customs. The Russian students plan trips to local 
attractions such as Disneyland and the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, student Egor Snopkouski, 12, went to Los Angeles to see the 
musical "Sunset Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very nice to see the play," he said. "I liked it very much." SHELBY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; FULLERTON-IRVINE RAIL ROUTE THE TOP PICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 28-mile urban rail route linking the Fullerton Amtrak station with Irvine's 
rail depot emerged Monday as the favorite among six under consideration by the 
Orange County Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, OCTA staff disclosed that it recommended the longer route and 
rejected three others that offered future opportunities for expansion beyond an 
initial starter line. 
</P>
<P>
 If ultimately approved, an initial urban rail project could be operational 
between 2002 and 2004, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday's OCTA board meeting, board members voted to pursue the 
Fullerton-to- Irvine route further in preparation for a final selection April 
11. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the vote, however, a March 14 public hearing will be held. Also, 
results of a public opinion survey will be discussed at OCTA's March 28 board 
meeting, OCTA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Transit Administration prefers that counties submit possibilities 
for long routes seeking federal funds. The purpose, said OCTA officials, is to 
demonstrate that a shorter route -- perhaps 13 miles -- can eventually be 
expanded at both ends to serve far more people. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine officials, who control $125 million in state rail bond money, are 
hoping that an initial 10- to 15-mile segment will include a portion of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some experts contend the initial segment should connect South Coast 
Plaza with Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 The longer Fullerton-to-Irvine route would be included in applications for 
federal funding to supplement the $340 million set aside for urban rail in 
Measure M, the half-cent sales tax for county traffic improvements approved by 
voters in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Urban rail service within one county would have more stops than today's 
inter-county commuter trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics, however, say such projects are too costly.JEFFREY A. PERLMAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; COUNCIL CANDIDATES' FILING PERIOD BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Filing opened Monday for what is expected to be a wide-open City Council 
election June 7, the only council race in the county regularly held in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Three council seats will be open -- those of incumbents Mike Eggers, Eileen 
Krause and Karen Lloreda. Although they have not yet formally announced their 
intentions, Lloreda has held a fund-raiser and is expected to run for 
reelection, while Krause remains undecided and Eggers is not expected to run. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility that two incumbents will not enter the race will undoubtedly 
cause more candidates to jump in, said City Clerk Sharon L. Waits. She said she 
has fielded 10 to 20 inquiries about the election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, a number of people will not run if they have to run against an 
incumbent," Waits said, adding that if an incumbent does not run, the candidate 
filing period is extended. 
</P>
<P>
 The filing period ends at 5 p.m. on March 11 unless an incumbent decides not 
to run, in which case the filing period will be extended until 5 p.m. on March 
16. 
</P>
<P>
 Eggers, who has served on the council for six years, has said that he will 
make a public announcement at the City Council meeting on March 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Two people generally mentioned as potential candidates took out filing papers 
Monday. They are Bill Shepherd, president of the Lantern Village Assn., and 
Robert Moore of Monarch Beach. Moore just missed being elected to the first 
City Council in 1988 when he finished sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Wilberg of Capistrano Beach, a former trustee of the Capistrano Bay 
Park and Recreation District, is also expected to be a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloreda and Ernest A. Nelson, who finished third and narrowly missed being 
elected in 1992, are the only two potential candidates who have raised money in 
the past six months, according to campaign disclosure statements filed Jan. 31 
with the city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloreda leads the duo in campaign money raised in the past six months, with a 
total of $4,000. Her leading contributors are Diane Harkey of Capistrano Beach, 
with a gift of $250, and Newport Beach attorney Paul Hamilton, with a gift of 
$330, according to her statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, a local engineer who raised $2,338 in the past six months, is expected 
to run. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members must be registered voters and residents of Dana Point. They 
are paid $400 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Each candidate must have his or her filing papers signed by at least 20 but no 
more than 30 Dana Point voters. There is no filing charge, although a candidate 
who wants a 200-word statement included in the sample ballot mailed to voters 
must pay $750.LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; MENTOR TEACHER PLAN TO BE STUDIED TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The school board tonight will review a program aimed at helping new teachers 
cope with their first few years in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, part of a $398,000 grant the Irvine Unified School District is 
sharing with several other districts in Orange County, will provide new 
teachers with added instruction and pair them with veteran "mentor" teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 20 "intern" teachers in Irvine are scheduled to take part in the 
program, which is being run in conjunction with the UC Irvine Education 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Intern" teachers are usually people working toward their teaching credentials 
who use their time in the classroom as a way of gaining experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, these interns will receive new training in "teaching survival 
skills" such as how to discipline students and manage a classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a class of 30 students, you have 30 different needs," said Sue Long, 
Irvine's deputy superintendent for personnel. "A new teacher has to be able to 
manage all these things." 
</P>
<P>
 The interns will receive instruction at UC Irvine on new curriculum and 
teaching methods. They will also work closely with experienced teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea to is have someone who really has been there and knows how the 
system is currently operated," Long said of a mentor teacher. "That person can 
serve as an expert and be a tremendous asset." 
</P>
<P>
 School districts in Tustin, Costa Mesa, Newport Beach and Santa Ana are also 
taking part in the program. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; HOAG EXPANSION PLAN TO GO BEFORE PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoag Hospital's expansion plan is scheduled for discussion and a vote before 
the Coastal Commission today in San Diego County.  
</P>
<P>
 The hospital has developed plans to build medical facilities on cattail-filled 
wetlands near Coast Highway.The proposal has generated opposition from the 
planning staff at the Coastal Commission.  
</P>
<P>
 The project, which was approved by the city of Newport Beach in May, 1992, 
anticipates the expansion of Hoag Hospital into a regional medical center 
within 25 years. Though the plan does not lay out specific building designs and 
functions, it does outline a proposed building size and density. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Commission was to vote on the expansion plans at its January 
meeting, but when the staff recommended that commissioners vote against it, 
Hoag officials asked that the matter be postponed until this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials are hoping the commissioners will approve the project this 
time around despite the staff's objections, said Peter Foulke, senior vice 
president at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dec. 28 Coastal Commission staff report urged the hospital to do more to 
offset the wetlands that would be lost. The report questions whether anything 
should be built on a coastal wetland. Commission officials claim there are four 
acres of wetlands, while the hospital says it is closer to 1 1/2 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 The site, which is known as the lower campus, already contains a cancer 
center, a child-care center, a parking lot and a stack to burn methane gases. 
The land also features a 40-foot bluff and a wetland area dominated by 
cattails. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Commission meeting is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. and will be 
held at the Marriott Hotel in Mission Valley at 8757 Rio San Diego Drive. BOB

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; BASKETS CARRY LOVE, HOUSEHOLD GOODIES

 The Laguna Fire Relief Coalition began the pleasant task Monday of 
distributing Valentine's Day baskets, stuffed with items as unexpected as a 
tiny television and as practical as a fly swatter, to victims of the October 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it Christmas?" asked one man, shaking his head as he bent to examine first 
one cellophane-wrapped package and then another. 
</P>
<P>
 Even coalition workers seemed stunned by the weekend delivery of more than 100 
baskets, tubs, planters and other containers bulging with goodies, from spices 
and cookbooks to gift wrapping and radios. The packages were prepared by the 
Junior League of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we first heard they were going to put together treat baskets, we were 
thinking candy hearts," director Anita Mangels said. "This stuff is amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 For some fire survivors, the toughest job Monday appeared to be deciding which 
package to choose. 
</P>
<P>
 Reah Travis, who lost her Canyon Acres home in the firestorm, settled on a 
basket laden with household supplies, including dish towels and toothbrushes, 
and topped with a pink bow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't even believe it . . . what people do for other people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Zech, president-elect of the Junior League of Orange County, which has 
helped fire victims since shortly after the firestorm, said the group's new 
members took on this latest project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were looking for other ways we could help," she said. The new members 
"really took it and ran with it and put it all together." 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Fire Relief Coalition provides a variety of assistance for fire 
survivors from its headquarters in the Boat Canyon shopping center, including 
crisis counseling, food, clothing and referrals to other support agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The baskets will be distributed throughout the week, until they are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to go pretty darn fast and today will be the big kickoff day," 
Mangels said Monday. "Our survivors are just going to be crazy about this 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the coalition office, former Canyon Acres resident Betty Watkins 
wrestled a bulky basket filled with crayons, greeting cards and noodles into 
her Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
 "I chose this one because it had a cordless screwdriver in it and I've been 
missing it," she said. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; CELEBRATION TODAY AT NEW PLAYGROUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 New play equipment in a city park usually doesn't prompt such ceremony and 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 But for residents near Costeau Park and Knotty Pine Park, whose children have 
been without anything to climb and crawl and slide on for a year and a half, 
today is a special day. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials and neighbors will gather at the two parks this afternoon for 
ceremonies to celebrate the installation of "state of the art" play equipment 
that replaces the outdated and unsafe equipment removed in August, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The play equipment in both of these parks was approaching 20 years old and it 
was severely outdated," said Dave Lewis, the city's parks and recreation 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous equipment was installed by the county parks department before 
Laguna Hills incorporated in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The new equipment, which cost $70,000, was selected by the city after a study 
by the Parks and Recreation Commission, with involvement from residents, Lewis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty much state of the art," Lewis said. "It's designed for varying 
age groups and to be challenging physically and socially and, of course, to be 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last 10 to 15 years, there's been a great amount of improvements in 
play-equipment design and construction, as well as safety," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the usual slides, swings and monkey bars, he said, "now they have 
integrated systems that are designed for specific age groups and that are 
intended for specific types of play." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides that, he added, "It looks neat. It enhances the look of the park." 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony at Costeau Park is at 3:30 p.m. and at Knotty Pine Park at 4:15 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Costeau Park is located at Costeau Street and Alicia Parkway. Knotty Pine Park 
is at Mackenzie Street and Knotty Pine Road.RICHARD CORE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SPENDING IDEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crime has emerged as a top concern in Seal Beach since a string of armed 
robberies last summer. The City Council will decide how to spend nearly 
$120,000 of Proposition 172 money later this year.Residents who live in the Old 
Town district want a police substation in the neighborhood. Others say 
resources should not be concentrated in just one area. Here's how council 
members suggest strengthening police services: 
</P>
<P>
 George Brown 
</P>
<P>
 Increase police patrols; would do more to prevent crime than building a 
substation. 
</P>
<P>
 William J. Doane 
</P>
<P>
 Increase police patrols and crime-prevention programs such as Neighborhood 
Watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Gwen Forsythe 
</P>
<P>
 Add a substation or increase patrols at the pier and Old Town; install video 
equipment in troublesome beach areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Bruce Hastings 
</P>
<P>
 Convert a portion of a lifeguard station at the Seal Beach Pier into a police 
substation.  
</P>
<P>
 Frank Laszlo 
</P>
<P>
 Place a police substation in a Main Street retail building in order to deter 
crime in the central business district.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; DETECTIVE GETS AWARD FROM D.A.'S OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Detective Kim Brown has one of the toughest caseloads on the force. 
</P>
<P>
 A father arrested for molesting his son. A woman abducted and raped in a 
parking lot and then again at the suspect's home. A man arrested for molesting 
his girlfriend's two daughters and the woman's friend. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a sample of the cases on Brown's beat: investigating sex crimes and 
sending the weirdos to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a real pleasant topic," Brown said. "In law enforcement, we put on 
our professional face and that's what carries us through . . . You have a 
professional job to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with that outlook, Brown said there are some cases "you can't help but 
think about . . . when you're off duty. Fortunately, those cases don't come too 
often." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was the investigator in the disturbing case of Kyung Mook (Edward) Cho, 
who was sentenced in May to 84 years in prison for 25 counts of rape, 
molestation and assault on his three daughters, one of whom committed suicide. 
Cho hanged himself in December in Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was sad to see the older daughter commit suicide," said Brown, who began 
work on the case in May, 1992. "She wasn't there to see the crime through. I 
wish she would have been there for the verdict because it took a lot of courage 
for her to come forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Victims of sex crimes often are reluctant to report the crime to police, she 
said, noting that the judicial process is often painful for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, however, finds professional and personal satisfaction in seeing an 
investigation turn into a conviction and she recently was commended for her 
investigative work by the Orange County District Attorney's office.  
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley police Capt. Bill De Nisisaid the award is the highest form of 
flattery. "It's just about the nicest compliment a police officer can get 
(because) it's coming from her peers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, 35, began her career with the department in June, 1983, as a patrol 
officer and later worked in crime prevention. She was assigned to sexual 
assault investigation 2 1/2 years ago.

 In addition to the sexual crimes, she also handles juvenile crime, including 
petty theft, assault and battery and trespassing.

 Crimes committed by juveniles, such as vandalism, graffiti, even murder, are 
increasing, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen the crimes become more serious -- more weapons violations, 
vandalism and car thefts," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than $3.7 million in federal block grants will be divided by the City 
Council tonight, with the biggest chunks slated for community centers, parks, 
code enforcement and the Police Department's anti-gang unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The citizens block grant committee and the city staff are recommending that 
the proposed downtown community center get the biggest grant, 
$974,583.Construction of the community center, which will contain a gymnasium, 
senior center and art gallery, is scheduled to begin in about two years. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60 city departments and community groups requested grants, but only 19 
are slated to receive funds. The block grants, from the Housing and Urban 
Development Department, are to benefit low- and moderate-income residents, aid 
in the elimination of slums and blight and alleviate serious immediate threats 
to community welfare. Last year, the city received $3.4 million in federal 
block grants. 
</P>
<P>
 The money must be spent between July 1 and June 30, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Other departments and programs scheduled to receive grants of more than 
$100,000 are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Code enforcement, which would get $718,024 to continue stepped-up efforts 
against dilapidated housing in the Central City, Citron, South Anaheim and 
Patrick Henry neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Community Development Department, which would use $225,000 to administer 
the grants. 
</P>
<P>
 * The proposed Citron Park, which would receive about $225,000 in acquisition 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 * The police anti-gang unit, which would receive $211,562 to continue paying 
eight officers' salaries and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 * The proposed South Anaheim Community Center, which would get about $180,000 
for construction. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Housing Department program for home rehabilitation loans for low-income 
residents, which would receive $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Manzanita Park, which would receive $117,000 for the expansion of its 
parking lot and picnic areas and for landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 The council meeting begins at 5 p.m. at City Hall, 200 S. Anaheim Blvd. TERRY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; RESIDENTS FIGHT PLAN TO BUILD WELL 
STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents living near Hisamatsu Tamura Elementary School hope to sink a 
proposal to build a pump well station on the school property to supply water 
for Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "This site is a lousy site because of the impact on neighbors and the value of 
their property," said resident Bob Moss, who has lived in the neighborhood for 
31 years. 
</P>
<P>
 His neighbor agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "To sacrifice someone else's property and lives is unfair," said Helen Bolen.  
</P>
<P>
 Bolen's husband, Earl, presented a petition with 22 signatures to trustees of 
residents opposing the pump well station at the school. He said he plans to 
continue circulating the petition in the neighborhood, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents opposed to the proposal attended last week's Fountain Valley School 
District Board of Trustees meeting, in which several homeowners addressed the 
board with their concerns during a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees are expected to take formal action on the proposal in March. Two 
wells would be drilled on the school property, Newport Beach officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners believe that building the water facility on school grounds will 
block views, add noise and cause vibrations that may result in damage to 
foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jeff Staneart, utilities department director for Newport Beach, said 
residents' concerns are unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "The activity and any noise around a well site is minimal," he said, adding 
that the pump well would be serviced once a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach has no wells because seawater has contaminated its underground 
water supply, Staneart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Staneart said it is cheaper for the city to produce its own water than to buy 
water from other sources. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fountain Valley is the closest area to Newport Beach that has a very large 
supply of ground water," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the wells would provide Newport Beach with a reliable water 
source should a catastrophic event affect pipelines that bring imported water 
to the city, Staneart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Bob Nigro said alternative sites for a well and pump house should be 
pursued that don't affect nearby homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigro said he understands the district's need to seek additional revenue, but 
not at the expense of residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Ecker, assistant superintendent of administration-business, said the 
school district is currently negotiating a land lease with Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Ecker said the district could get up to $250,000 if a 10-year lease is signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ecker also said the pump well station, which would be built on a 
7,500-square-foot section of the school property with a one-story building 16 
feet to 18 feet high, poses no safety threat to students. 
</P>
<P>
 Staneart said Newport Beach is also seeking a second site in Fountain Valley 
for two wells. The four wells, he said, would supply 80,000 Newport Beach 
customers with water, he said. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; SCHOOL BOUNDARY PLANS UP FOR REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Westminster School district will hold a public meeting tonight to discuss 
a newly revised plan to alter school attendance boundaries for the 1994-95 
school year, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent changes to the plan, which Supt.Gail Wickstrom proposed Feb. 3, will 
primarily affect students now attending Ada E. Clegg, James W. Franklin and 
Cecil B. DeMille elementary schools. Parents of students at those campuses are 
encouraged to attend the public meeting at 7 p.m., spokeswoman Audrey Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neomia B. Willmore Elementary will reopen in September, and Wickstrom has 
recommended that the district close Virginia K. Boos and James W. Franklin 
elementary schools for financial and student enrollment reasons. As a result, 
the district must shift attendance boundaries to balance enrollment throughout 
the southwest portion of the district, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest proposed boundary revisions are intended to eliminate busing while 
maintaining schools' enrollment at acceptable levels. Under the plan, students 
now attending Virginia K. Boos and Franklin would be able to walk to their new 
school. Also, some Clegg and DeMille students now bused from the Land School 
neighborhood would attend C. Fred Schroeder Elementary School, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's meeting will be held at Clegg, 6311 Larchwood Drive, in Huntington 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 A public hearing on the proposal will be held Thursday at Stacey Intermediate 
School, 6311 Larchwood Drive, in Huntington Beach. The Board of Education is 
expected to make a decision on whether to approve Wickstrom's proposal or adopt 
an alternative boundary plan on March 3.JON NALICK

DISGRUNTLED OCTA OFFICIALS SEEK TO SEVER COUNTY TIES TO REGIONAL GROUP; 
TRANSPORTATION: THEY ARE DISMAYED THAT LOS ANGELES' FINANCIAL WOES ARE 
JEOPARDIZING LOCAL HIGHWAY PROJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Reeling from word that a funding crisis in Los Angeles County could delay 
Orange County transportation projects, officials here want to disentangle 
Orange County from the regional group that controls funding and are seeking the 
Clinton Administration's help. 
</P>
<P>
 If something is not done, Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said Monday, "the 
voters' mandate" for $3.1 billion in Measure M traffic improvements in Orange 
County "will be stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to White House Special Assistant Tom Epstein, Wieder expressed the 
board's concern, saying: "If the construction programs are stopped, jobs will 
be lost, and the region is pushed further into recession." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem arises because Orange and Los Angeles counties are partners in the 
same regional transportation and clean-air pacts. To offset the increased 
automotive emissions that could result from cars using new highways, each 
region or county makes a commitment to undertake a number of mass-transit or 
car-pool projects. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority comes up 
short of funds, as it has this year, and cannot fulfill its commitments under 
plans to improve air quality, new highway projects throughout the region come 
under review. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday's Orange County Transportation Authority board meeting, La Habra 
Councilman William D. Mahoney summed up the feeling of the board: "We need to 
cast our own destiny." 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA officials suggested that Orange County sever its ties with the Southern 
California Assn. of Governments, a six-county agency that controls federal 
funding for transportation projects in the region. SCAG must determine whether 
there are sufficient transit projects funded in Los Angeles to offset increased 
emissions generated by planned Orange County freeway improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA officials said last week that SCAG and the U.S. Department of 
Transportation may be forced to take Orange County road projects out of 
regional transportation programs because Los Angeles County is short about $350 
million it needs to complete promised transit and car-pool projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles officials are scrambling to find the money and are considering bus 
fare hikes as well as cuts in bus service. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the issue came before the OCTA board of directors Monday, board 
members were not satisfied by assurances that Los Angeles will find the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Some OCTA officials spoke of lobbying federal officials to treat each county 
separately, at least for purposes of imposing sanctions. Attorneys at the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency have already nixed that idea, although such a 
change was previously enacted for the Virginia and Maryland suburbs of 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Even separate sanctions would not be sufficient, some OCTA officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by alternate board member Eileen Krause, a Dana Point councilwoman, and La 
Habra's Mahoney, OCTA officials said it is time to consider having OCTA -- or a 
similar board -- become the county's own regional planning agency, at least for 
transportation issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said it would take action by Congress and the state Legislature to 
permit such a transition. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA has hired a University of California professor to study the issue, and 
the OCTA staff may make recommendations in March. 
</P>
<P>
 But friction between Orange County and SCAG is nothing new. Until recently, 
for example, the Board of Supervisors did not pay dues to SCAG because of fears 
that SCAG is dominated by Los Angeles-oriented politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Oftelie, OCTA's chief executive officer, simply sees SCAG as an 
unnecessary third layer of government. He believes the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District could check on Orange County's conformity with regional 
clean-air goals. 
</P>
<P>
 SCAG is caught in the middle. On the one hand, it is charged with approving 
funding and making determinations about conformity with regional goals. But on 
the other hand, SCAG has not been able to coordinate transportation planning 
across county borders. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Los Angeles was able to add car-pool lanes to the San Diego 
Freeway that did not connect with those built earlier in Orange County. And the 
Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority has no plans to extend 
one of its rail lines from Norwalk to the Orange County line so that it could 
connect with Orange County's planned urban rail route. As a result, OCTA is 
setting its own urban rail priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 SCAG officials, however, said they think the problem is being exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Pisano, SCAG's executive director, said Monday that Los Angeles will make 
good on its commitments. Moreover, Pisano said, counties such as Orange would 
not be entitled to build some of their new roads were it not for the transit 
projects in Los Angeles.

 The wreckage of a small plane believed to have flown out of Orange County was 
found in rugged mountains near here early Monday, the El Dorado County 
Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue crews reached the crash site and recovered the body of the pilot, who 
was alone in the craft. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's name was withheld pending positive identification. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County deputies said they had received similar information but were 
waiting for fingerprint confirmation of the man's identity.

<P>
 El Dorado County Sheriff's Sgt. Steve Stroot said the four-seater Cherokee 
went down Sunday in the Tucker Flat area near the El Dorado-Alpine County line. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash occurred in heavily wooded terrain shortly after takeoff at 3:51 
p.m. from South Lake Tahoe Airport.

UMBERG FAILS AT VETO OVERRIDE ATTEMPT; POLITICS: HIS BILL WOULD HAVE REQUIRED 
WEALTHY PRISON INMATES TO PAY THE COST OF THEIR INCARCERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move riddled with election-year politics, the Assembly rejected an 
attempt Monday by Orange County Assemblyman Tom Umberg to override a veto of 
his bill that would have required wealthy prison inmates to pay the cost of 
their incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal by Umberg (D-Garden Grove) had sailed through the Legislature on 
a series of unanimous committee and floor votes last year before it was vetoed 
Oct. 11 by Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Assembly on Monday voted 42 to 31 along strict partisan lines, falling 
well short of the two-thirds needed for an override. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Republicans claimed that amendments watering down the bill had been 
slipped in at the 11th hour of last year's session before they had time to 
review the details. 
</P>
<P>
 They also echoed arguments made by Wilson in vetoing the measure -- that it 
was too weak and wouldn't hit all inmates. The bill exempts from consideration 
up to $730,000 in personal assets, including an inmate's home or car, meaning 
that only the wealthy could be forced to pay their costs of incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bill only applies to rich people," Assemblyman Dean Andal (R-Stockton) 
said, adding that "if this bill applied to everyone, we'd support it." 
</P>
<P>
 Andal and other Republicans also suggested Umberg's measure would cause 
gridlock in the courts by requiring extensive hearings to determine a 
prisoner's financial worth. "It would be extremely costly," Andal said. "We 
might as well call it the lawyer's full-employment act." 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg and Democrat backers of the bill said such arguments were unfounded and 
ignored practical realities. Asset hearings could be combined with other court 
proceedings, they said. In addition, even if the bill applied to all prisoners, 
prosecutors would probably only pursue those who actually had the economic 
clout to afford the more than $20,000-a-year cost of a prison stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps this is not a perfect bill," Umberg told his colleagues during debate 
on the measure. "But perhaps one of the people who stand up to oppose this bill 
should explain to me why Joe Hunt of the Billionaire Boys Club shouldn't pay 
the cost of his incarceration? Why shouldn't Charles Keating pay his cost of 
incarceration? Why shouldn't Charles Manson?" 
</P>
<P>
 If the measure tapped funds from just 1% of the prison population, it would 
save the state $38 million a year, Umberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg argued that Wilson had "made a mistake" by vetoing the bill and that 
Republicans were trying to cover for the governor in this election year. "We 
all voted for the bill last year," he said. "Let's vote for this thing again. 
It was a good idea when you voted for it, it's a good idea now." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the bill originally hit all prisoners equally, it was amended in 
committee by liberal lawmakers reluctant to impose strict financial penalties 
that could put a prisoner's family out on the streets and on the public dole. 
The Assembly gave the amended version of the bill final approval on a 77-0 vote 
on Sept. 2, eight days before the close of session. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides appeared to be grappling for political gain in the struggle over 
Umberg's bill. Assemblyman Louis Caldera (D-Los Angeles) suggested that 
Republicans were back-peddling on the measure in part because they didn't want 
to give a political plum to Umberg, who is making a run for state attorney 
general. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Umberg had a good idea here. In fact, it's such a good idea that Mr. 
Andal wants to carry it now," Caldera said, adding that lawmakers should "look 
at the bill on its merits, not on whether Mr. Umberg is running for attorney 
general." 
</P>
<P>
 But in trying to win the override for Umberg's bill, Democrats were also 
playing politics, stocking up on election-day ammunition they hope will make 
Republicans appear weaker on crime.

STUDY SAYS BRACINGS SHOULD HAVE SAVED JUMBOTRON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An engineering study done before the 1988 installation of Anaheim Stadium's 
Sony Jumbotron said the stadium's bracings should have been able to safely 
support the scoreboard during the Northridge earthquake, documents released 
Monday show. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1985 report, the construction firm of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill said 
the original scoreboard that the Jumbotron replaced weighed 38,000 pounds, and 
that the bracings had been engineered to support a scoreboard weighing up to 
42,000 pounds, and perhaps more. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35,000-pound Jumbotron collapsed during the Jan. 17 quake, crushing and 
damaging about 1,000 seats in the stadium's upper left field deck. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have said repairs will probably cost several million dollars, 
and would not be covered under the city's earthquake insurance policy, which 
has a deductible of $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Skidmore, the San Francisco firm that in 1979 built the stadium section where 
the Jumbotron was located, said in its 1985 report that even if a replacement 
scoreboard weighed 4,000 pounds more than the original one, it would be "a 
manageable increase." 
</P>
<P>
 The contract for installing the board eventually went to Sony, which 
subcontracted the work to White Way Sign Inc. of Chicago. It completed the 
installation in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1985 letter to White Way, former Assistant City Manager Cynthia King 
wrote: "The architectural/engineering consultant has concluded that this area 
can be modified to support a weight of no more than (between) 40,000 and 50,000 
pounds without major structural improvements." 
</P>
<P>
 Skidmore officials, Stadium General Manager Greg Smith and City Atty. Jack L. 
White did not return calls Monday. Sony, which has its American headquarters in 
New Jersey, and White Way, in Chicago, had closed for the day by the time 
Anaheim released the documents Monday.

3 ARRESTED IN CREDIT CARD FRAUD RING; CRIME: SUSPECTS ALLEGEDLY USED FORGERIES 
TO BUY COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND RESELL IT FOR PROFIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 U.S. Secret Service agents and police detectives from as far away as Las Vegas 
have been investigating a man suspected of using forged credit cards to buy 
computer equipment and then reselling it locally and overseas, authorities said 
Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 Secret Service agents Friday tracked down Walter Randall Shaw, 57, of Chino 
Hills, to the Fountain Valley Inn, where police arrested him. Shaw then led 
investigators to a 20-year-old accomplice from Westminster, who police suspect 
made hundreds of forged credit cards at his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the pair, along with a Huntington Beach man, defrauded banks and 
credit card holders of about $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a pretty good-sized, decent bust," said Fountain Valley Police 
Detective Sara Long. 
</P>
<P>
 Long said Shaw is scheduled to be arraigned today in Municipal Court in 
Westminster on several counts of credit card forgery. He was being held at the 
Orange County Jail in lieu of $10,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Tin Tri Nguyen, a suspected gang member from Westminster, was released on bail 
Saturday. He also faces several counts of credit card fraud, Long said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police also arrested Tri Dong Nguyen, 19, of Huntington Beach. Long said the 
Tustin Police Department is handling his case. Tustin police detectives could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Long said investigators believe bank employees slipped valid credit card 
numbers, as well as account descriptions and Social Security numbers, to Tin 
Tri Nguyen. He then allegedly used encoding and magnetic striping machines to 
make fake credit cards, Long said. Police also allege that he forged driver's 
licenses to be used with the credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw allegedly used the fake credit cards to buy laptop computers, laser 
printers and other computer equipment at stores where clerks who were in on the 
scheme accepted the forged cards, Long said. That equipment would then be 
resold for a profit, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, who is listed as a nutritionist on his voter registration record, was 
allegedly using a fake credit card when he was arrested Friday morning at the 
Fountain Valley Inn. Secret Service agents, who had been following his trail 
for several months, told Fountain Valley police where Shaw was, and they 
arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
 Long said Shaw then told police that Tin Tri Nguyen was supplying him with the 
forged cards. She said Nguyen cooperated with investigators, leading them to 
his home, where investigators confiscated stolen credit cards, blank credit 
cards, a personal computer and counterfeiting machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't until Friday that . . . the person manufacturing the credit cards 
was identified," Long said. "We got the second half of it and it all came into 
place."

2 ARRESTED IN ALLEGED TELEPHONE SCAM WARNING OF POLICE TROUBLE

 Police arrested two people Monday on suspicion of operating a telephone scam 
in which callers posed as police representatives, and threatened "trouble" 
unless contributions were made, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what we know, lot of calls were made to the Latino community," said 
Deputy Dist. Atty.Jane L. Shade of the consumer protection unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Callers from Tri County Associates identified themselves as representatives of 
Santa Ana, Garden Grove, Orange and Costa Mesa police departments, authorities 
said, claiming on some occasions to be calling for the Fox TV show "Cops." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who refused to contribute were warned they would have "trouble" with 
police, or lose their 911 emergency telephone service, police said. 
Contributors were promised a car window sticker that would afford them 
favorable treatment in the event of a traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana police and D.A.'s investigators executed search warrants at the 
offices of Tri County Associates, in the 1500 block of East Edinger Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested were Richard John Levine, 59, of Orange, the owner of the company, 
and Maria Isabel Gonzalez, 34, of Santa Ana, the manager. Levine is being held 
at the Orange County Jail on $100,000 bail. Gonzalez's bail is $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrest warrants were also issued for Irineo Morales Lopez, 41, and Augustin 
Balle Alvares, 26, both of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 All are accused of one count of conspiracy to commit grand theft by false 
pretenses and one count of grand theft by false pretenses. If convicted, they 
face up to three years in prison, Shade said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Levine is accused of five counts of violating an earlier court 
order, requiring him and his business to refrain from making false and 
misleading statements.

BONE SITES VERIFIED AT BOLSA CHICA WETLANDS; ARTIFACTS: NATIVE AMERICANS SAY 
PLANNED DEVELOPMENT IS ON BURIAL GROUND. IT'S NOT KNOWN IF BONES ARE HUMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 More than 20 concentrations of bones lie in the path of a major housing 
development that the Koll Real Estate Group wants to build near the Bolsa Chica 
wetlands, according to a study commissioned by the Orange County coroner's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Coroner's officials acknowledged the findings Monday, noting that it could be 
months before it can be determined whether the bones belonged to humans or 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 However, one set of human bones believed to be about 8,000 years old was found 
at the site in 1992. And word of this most recent discovery has lent some 
credence to the arguments of Native American leaders, who say the 7.4-acre 
parcel may have once been a prehistoric Indian burial site. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's a dedicated cemetery, that's it!" said Jim Velasques, chief of the 
coastal Gabrieleno Shoshone tribe. "It's sacred. You cannot dig up bones if you 
have six or more burials without the consent of the descendants." 
</P>
<P>
 Koll officials said, however, that the most recent discovery of the bones 
would not affect their plans for a 4,286-home development proposed for 400 
acres near the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that the site is of great importance to the ancient 
history of Orange County," said Lucy Dunn, a senior vice president. "But we've 
designed the most sensitive plan that can possibly be designed. . . . It's not 
likely that a redesign will be necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 The map obtained from the coroner's office details at least 20 sites where 
bone matter has been found. It was prepared for the Koll Real Estate Group by 
Nancy Whitney-Desautels, an archeologist excavating the site. 
</P>
<P>
 While state law does not expressly forbid the destruction of Native American 
cemeteries, experts say, public pressure could persuade county officials to 
require the developer to make major modifications in the project to preserve 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue first drew fire last month when opponents of the project began 
circulating a memo written by a forensic anthropologist hired by the Orange 
County coroner's office to examine the bones found at the site in 1992. In the 
memo, Judy Myers Suchey, a faculty member at Cal State Fullerton, described the 
handful of human bones she had seen as "very old, approximately 8,000 years," 
and therefore of serious interest to archeologists. 
</P>
<P>
 Angered that no mention of the find had been made in the county's draft 
environmental impact report released last year, project opponents gathered en 
masse during a city hearing on the matter that attracted 600 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, a group of Native Americans staged a protest on the steps of 
Huntington Beach City Hall, contending that they had been left in the dark 
regarding the disposition of their ancestors' remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Copies of the map, which had not previously been made public, also were 
circulated at the demonstration. Prepared in August, 1993, the map is covered 
with marks indicating locations described in a legend as "known bone 
concentrations." 
</P>
<P>
 What is not clear, Whitney-Desautels said Monday, is how many of the bones are 
animal and how many human. However, she did not rule out the possibility that 
the area was a Native American cemetery. She described it as "a difficult case" 
because the human bones discovered so far are tiny and intermingled with animal 
bones also found at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the coroner's office said that traditionally about 50% of the 
bones reported to Sheriff's Department turn out to be those of animals. 
According to Whitney-Desautels, two of the more than 20 bone concentrations at 
Bolsa Chica have already been determined to be those of deer and dolphin. The 
rest are in laboratories being studied. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should know in about three months," she said. "At this point it's 
impossible to say how many (human) individuals are there." 
</P>
<P>
 This latest development, however, seemed to have clear implications for Native 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the bones of our great ancestors," said Martin Alcala, chairman of 
the Gabrieleno/Tongva Tribal Council. "They are culturally and spiritually 
significant to us. It would be the same as if we went into your graveyards and 
started digging up your ancestors."

O.C. SUPERVISOR RACE IS OFF TO A SPIRITED START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The top three contenders to replace retiring Orange County Supervisor Harriett 
M. Wieder bolted out of the starting gate Monday, hurling barbs and challenges 
in a three-way cross-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first day for county and congressional candidates to announce for 
the June 7 primary election and the last day for candidates to file for two 
hotly contested Assembly seats, those being given up by Assemblyman Gil 
Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) and Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove), the 
county's only Democrat in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was any doubt that the nonpartisan District 2 contest to replace 
Wieder would be spirited, it was erased Monday when the three main contenders 
-- all from Huntington Beach -- crossed swords. The city's mayor, Linda 
Moulton-Patterson, fired the first shot, followed by developer Haydee Tillotson 
and Councilman Jim Silva. 
</P>
<P>
 During a news conference outside the registrar of voters office that drew 
about 45 supporters, Moulton-Patterson said that her opponents are 
standard-bearers of "business as usual" -- business that is driven by "special 
interests" and the local development community. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton-Patterson said Tillotson, who was recruited by Wieder, is a candidate 
who would "see things more from the developer's point of view." 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech that was as much a criticism of the county's current leadership as 
a statement of her positions on the issues, Moulton-Patterson said she favored 
deportation of illegal immigrants, welfare limits, no new taxes and term limits 
for supervisors, even pledging to limit her service to eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 But even before Moulton-Patterson finished her speech, a Tillotson campaign 
statement was distributed among the crowd, calling on Moulton-Patterson and 
Silva not to seek or accept political contributions from "any business or 
individual who has sought, or is seeking, their vote" on the City Council or 
commissions on which the two candidates serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Tillotson also called on Moulton-Patterson to resign from the California 
Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I resigned from the Orange County Planning Commission when I decided to seek 
election to the Board of Supervisors to avoid even the appearance of any 
conflicts of interest," Tillotson said in the statement. "I am now calling upon 
Linda and Jim to take a first step in rejecting the 'business as usual' 
fund-raising tactics of the past." 
</P>
<P>
 In her statement, Tillotson also said she has raised about $60,000 "from 
individuals, friends and concerned Orange County citizens who had nothing to 
gain except good government in California." 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton-Patterson and Silva, who held his own news conference later in the 
day, both rejected Tillotson's demands, saying they would abide by the campaign 
financing rules that apply to county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 And they pointed out that Tillotson also has received money from the 
development community. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, all three candidates have received campaign funds from the Koll Real 
Estate Group or its top officials, according to campaign finance statements 
filed earlier this year. The development company has raised the ire of 
Huntington Beach environmentalists by proposing that 4,286 homes be built on 
400 acres in the Bolsa Chica wetlands area. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Moulton-Patterson said she quit receiving donations from the Koll Co. 
after 1990, even though they were non-paying members of an honorary host 
committee for a political fund-raiser she held last April. 
</P>
<P>
 While she has accepted financial contributions from the development community 
in general, Moulton-Patterson said, "I will not be beholden to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Silva did not apologize for campaign contributions he has received from the 
Koll Co. or any other group or individual. "I feel I am representing them, and 
they have a right to put money in my campaign," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 During his own campaign speech at the Huntington Beach pier, which drew about 
55 supporters, Silva listed issues similar to those of his opponents: making 
law enforcement the county's top budget priority, opposing higher taxes and 
increased fees and preventing illegal immigrants from receiving welfare 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva characterized the race as a choice between "a candidate that's never 
been elected to an office" but runs on promises -- a reference to Tillotson -- 
and candidates who have established records. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning his attention to Moulton-Patterson, a Democrat, Silva criticized her 
for supporting President Clinton, and for being one who "supports the 
tax-and-spend philosophy of the Democratic Party (and) supported cable 
television tax and trash fee increases" in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In wrapping up his speech, Silva said, "May the best man win." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing at his side were Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) and 
Supervisor Roger R. Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said Silva was "too much of a gentleman" to contrast himself to his 
opponents, so he would take on the task. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes logic, common sense, a deep, sincere concern for the community above 
a concern for one's individual ego and one's individual image," Stanton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Republican leaders who are backing Silva include Rep. Christopher Cox of 
Newport Beach, Rep. Robert K. Dornan of Garden Grove, Rep. Ed Royce of 
Fullerton, state Sen. John Lewis of Garden Grove, Assemblyman Curt Pringle of 
Garden Grove and Assemblyman Gil Ferguson of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates for county offices, including the 2nd, 4th and 5th districts on the 
Board of Supervisors, sheriff-coroner, district attorney and the county Board 
of Education, as well as congressional candidates, have until March 11 to file 
their declarations of candidacy. If the incumbent does not file, the deadline 
to file is extended to March 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the races in the two Assembly districts without incumbents took 
final shape Monday, the last day for candidates to file their declarations of 
intent to run in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 69th Assembly District race to replace Umberg, both the Democratic and 
Republican primaries have drawn a long list of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Four Democrats are seeking their party's nomination: Latino political activist 
Zeke Hernandez; Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce President Michael Metzler; Santa 
Ana Councilman Ted R. Moreno; and Santa Ana contractor John Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans are: Martin Ageson, a Costa Mesa business attorney and member 
of the conservative Republican Lincoln Club who moved into the district to seek 
the Republican nomination; Santa Ana school board member Rosemarie I. Avila; 
businesswoman Judy Buffin-Edge; Republican Party activist and businessman Jim 
Morrissey and businessman Virgel L. Nickell. 
</P>
<P>
 The Libertarian candidate is George Reis of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 70th Assembly District, considered the most Republican district in the 
state, the only contest will be in the Republican primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican candidates are Marilyn C. Brewer, an aide to county Supervisor 
Thomas F. Riley; Irvine attorney Phillip B. Greer; Irvine Councilman Barry J. 
Hammond; Irvine resident Scott McDougle; Irvine attorney Bruce E. Peotter; and 
Newport Beach attorney Thomas G. Reinecke, son of a former California 
lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa lawyer Jim Toledano is the only Democrat to file for the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 In the statewide race for insurance commissioner, three Orange County 
Republicans will be on the ballot. They are former Huntington Beach Mayor Wes 
Bannister, who was the 1990 Republican nominee for the office; Glen J. Dulac, 
also of Huntington Beach, and Jack Harden of La Habra. Candidate Filings 
</P>
<P>
 The filing deadline for the following races in the June 7 primary was extended 
to Monday because the incumbents chose not to seek reelection. Here are the 
candidates who filed at the Orange County registrar of voters office to run in 
those races.

GUNMAN AT TORRANCE HOTEL KILLS 2 POLICEMEN; VIOLENCE: VICTIMS WERE VETERANS OF 
THE PALOS VERDES ESTATES DEPARTMENT. THEIR ASSAILANT DIES IN THE INCIDENT.

 Brandishing two handguns and yelling, "This is a robbery!" a masked gunman 
opened fire on a police motivational seminar at a Holiday Inn in Torrance on 
Monday, killing two suburban policemen before he was subdued and later 
pronounced dead, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two veterans of the Palos Verdes Estates Police Department -- Capt. Mike 
Tracy, 50, of Redondo Beach, and Sgt. Tom Vanderpool, 57, of Torrance -- were 
shot to death in the 3:50 p.m. attack, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 32-year-old assailant, whose name was not released pending notification of 
his family was taken to Little Company of Mary Hospital in Torrance, were he 
was pronounced dead, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said there were some similarities between the gunman, a young Asian, 
and a suspect in the shooting of a Manhattan Beach officer two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the shootings occurred as 13 police and city officials from the 
upscale South Bay community of Palos Verdes Estates were wrapping up an all-day 
meeting in the hotel's 12th-floor meeting room. The deaths were the first 
fatalities in the history of the tight-knit, 35-member department. 
</P>
<P>
 The seminar, which was to have lasted two days, was sponsored by the city, and 
attended by the top brass of the Police Department and City Hall, said City 
Manager Jim Hendrickson, who was among those seated around the square 
conference table. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said it was unclear whether the attacker knew he was shooting at law 
enforcement officers. All the police at the seminar were in plainclothes. And 
the session was identified at the hotel only as a Palos Verdes Estates meeting, 
without specifying police involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of the seminar, Torrance Police Sgt. Dave Smith said, the door 
burst open and a man stepped into the room, his face obscured by a fencing mask 
and hooded sweat shirt, his chest thickened by the bulk of a bulletproof vest. 
</P>
<P>
 When he announced that he planned to rob the group, Smith said, one officer 
stood and was immediately shot. Then, when the second officer stood to come to 
the aid of the wounded man, the attacker fired on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Hendrickson, who was sitting with his back to the door, said events unfolded 
so quickly that at first he believed the gunman was joking, and so did most of 
the officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanderpool, a 13-year veteran of the department, stood and said "in earthy 
language, 'I'm not going to take this,' " Hendrickson said. The gunman fired 
two or three times, hitting Vanderpool in the chest, Hendrickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of us comprehended that this was real," he said. "The sounds went 
pop-pop-pop." 
</P>
<P>
 Then as Tracy rushed to the sergeant's aid, the gunman fired again, hitting 
Tracy in the chest, as three or four other police officers leaped across the 
table and pinned the gunman to a wall, Hendrickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, whose department is investigating the incident, would not say how the 
gunman died. Hospital officials, saying they were acting at the behest of 
Torrance police, refused to divulge the cause of the gunman's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Palos Verdes Estates Police Chief Gary Johansen, who was at the meeting, said 
he did not know how the man died, but he did not hear him being shot. "Nobody 
had a chance to get their guns," Johansen said, adding that "the assailant was 
fighting something fierce. I don't know if he was beaten -- he still had a gun 
in his hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they do not know why the gunman chose that meeting room. "It 
was a regular business meeting. They were wearing regular attire and that's the 
key," Smith said. "We don't know at this point if (the gunman) knew who they 
were or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Smith and detectives at the Manhattan Police Department said they are 
investigating the possibility that the shooting may be linked to the fatal 
attack two months ago on another South Bay police officer, Martin Ganz of the 
Manhattan Beach Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Ganz, 29, was shot to death Dec. 27 during a seemingly routine traffic stop. 
Assigned to a holiday drunk-driving abatement patrol, investigators said, he 
had used his patrol car loudspeaker to pull over a Daihatsu Charade in front of 
a Manhattan Beach mall about 11 p.m., and was shot when he got out of the car. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness to the shooting -- the officer's 13-year-old nephew who happened to 
be with him on a department sponsored ride-along -- said the gunman was a 
heavyset Asian in his 30s, a description that fits the killer in Monday's 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was a stunning blow to the placid seaside community of Palos 
Verdes Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanderpool and Tracy were well-known veterans of the department, with 13 and 
25 years, respectively, on the force. Vanderpool was the oldest member of the 
department and Tracy at one point was a contender for the job of police chief, 
officials said. Each leaves behind three grown children. Tracy was a 
grandfather, friends said. Monday was Vanderpool's wedding anniversary. One 
grief-stricken colleague described them as "everybody's friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Johansen lauded the heroism of the two men. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman, Johansen said, "probably did not know the room was full of cops, 
but we are sure that when he found out, he would have killed everyone in the 
room if given a chance. Capt. Mike Tracy and Sgt. Tom Vanderpool didn't give 
him that chance. Their unselfish valor saved every other officer in that room."

 It's Tuesday morning and the students in Bonnie Park's classroom at Acacia 
Middle School are chanting up a storm. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the classroom of 12- and 13-year-olds sings the praises of 
abstinence, a chorus of critics of the Sex Respect sex education course is 
beginning to raise its voice across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Sex Respect argues that by remaining celibate, you won't need contraception. 
And with chastity, God is always on your side. The program, used in more than 
1,500 school districts nationwide, was created in 1986 as a conservative 
alternative to sex education. It has become a target of Planned Parenthood and 
the American Civil Liberties Union, which call it a tool of the Christian 
right. And a growing number of parents in many districts have begun to agitate 
for a more pragmatic approach to teens and sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Potentially as volatile as debates over creationism and abortion, the conflict 
is fueling lawsuits and school board warfare from Louisiana to Riverside 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents say past educational initiatives have failed to get teens to use 
contraceptives and have even encouraged sex. They contend that adopting a 
safe-sex-is-no-sex approach replaces fear with self-control and self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-week course is based on a textbook written by an Illinois woman who is 
an anti-abortion activist and former Catholic school educator. It focuses 
almost entirely on morality, warning of the dangers of promiscuity and 
premarital sex while extolling the virtues of sex -- but only within marriage. 
Discussion of the reproductive system is limited to two pages at the end of the 
book. 
</P>
<P>
 Responsibility is better than abortion and sexually transmitted disease, its 
proponents argue. Sex education based on maturity and not permissiveness is 
long overdue, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics counter that Sex Respect tests the bounds of law and science by 
favoring moral pleas over clinical information and spurning even the mention of 
contraception. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that teen-agers, especially young ones, be told that it's better not 
to engage in intercourse makes a great deal of sense," said Debra Haffner, 
executive director of the U.S. Sex Information and Education Council. "But the 
problem is that Sex Respect contains many inaccuracies. It is based on a 
premise that young people should not make their own decisions, and it is 
extremely negative about sexuality. It goes beyond teaching them how to resist 
peer pressure and presents them with a single moral message." 
</P>
<P>
 In Hemet, the ACLU and Planned Parenthood teamed with an outraged parent to 
wage battle against Park, who doubles as a teacher and school trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Park introduced the program to Acacia Middle School, where about 900 
seventh-graders each year complete the course that is taught by seven teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 A born-again Christian, Park said Planned Parenthood and the ACLU are "on a 
mission to get rid of Sex Respect because it isn't politically correct. It 
doesn't promote the safe-sex agenda . . . the homosexual agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 She calls two of her grandchildren "condom babies," proving that the "darn 
things don't even work half the time. How can they be counted on to stop the 
spread of HIV?" 
</P>
<P>
 Maureen Bryan, the parent who filed the complaint, calls Sex Respect "a 
fear-based, abstinence-only curriculum that I see as utterly inappropriate 
because of its religious bias, its overt counseling against abortion and its 
perpetuation of stereotypes that don't belong in a public environment." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Bryan took her adolescent son out of the program, which she said 
"taught him he was an animal who would most likely do anything he pleased -- 
his biology made him that way -- and that it was up to the female to control 
his behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, on Page 6 of the Sex Respect book, the text says that "boys tend to 
use love to get sex. Girls tend to use sex to get love." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1986 version of Sex Respect -- which underwent minor revisions in 1990 -- 
also noted that "nature is making some kind of a comment on sexual behavior 
through the AIDS and herpes epidemics." That alone led to Sex Respect being 
banned in Louisiana, where a district judge called the course medically 
inaccurate and fraught with moral judgments. 
</P>
<P>
 With the prevalence of AIDS and the rise in teen pregnancies, school boards 
ponder not whether to teach sex education, but how. Since 1987, 22 states have 
passed laws requiring some type of sex education. Sex Respect has given 
conservatives a vehicle to control the boundaries of the debate. But 
increasingly, it is being met with challenges in the courts and at the ballot 
box. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney for the Hemet Unified School District, Karen Gilyard, recommended 
that Sex Respect be dropped after Bryan filed a stinging complaint. Citing a 
common criticism, the attorney said Sex Respect comes dangerously close to 
blurring the line between church and state. 
</P>
<P>
 In her opinion, Gilyard said the course violates the state education code. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hemet school board, dominated by a conservative Christian majority, 
rejected the complaint, then hinted at getting a new lawyer. But in recent 
weeks, the mood has mellowed. Some board members now favor dropping the program 
or having the state attorney general review it. 
</P>
<P>
 Such volatility is becoming more common: 
</P>
<P>
 * In north San Diego County, the Vista Unified School District is enmeshed in 
a rough-and-tumble recall campaign that may result in its controversial board 
-- also dominated by a Christian right majority -- adopting the program over 
the objections of some parents and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the board order the implementation of Sex Respect -- which would cost 
the district $30 per student more than its current, state-sanctioned program -- 
a parents group has threatened to sue. 
</P>
<P>
 * The program's stiffest challenge came last year in Caddo Parish, La., where 
a state district judge found that portions of the course material violated 
Louisiana law because they contained religious beliefs, counseled students 
about abortion, provided inaccurate medical information and illegally quizzed 
students about religious and sexual beliefs. Sex Respect later was yanked from 
classrooms, a ruling the school district is appealing, while legal fees climb 
past $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * In East Troy, Wis., the state Department of Public Instruction concluded 
that the material perpetuated sex stereotypes but said the department lacked 
the authority to have the text removed. Late last year, however, East Troy 
school trustees voted to drop Sex Respect in favor of more comprehensive sex 
education. (A school district in Sheboygan, Wis., one of the first to use the 
course, dropped it in 1989 after deciding that it was biased and lacked 
credibility.) 
</P>
<P>
 * In Wilmington, N.C., trustees voted in 1992 to adopt a comprehensive sex 
education program that preaches abstinence but concedes the necessity of 
contraceptives. Trustees acted only after parents groups lobbied heavily for 
Sex Respect. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Beaufort County, S.C., a third of parents pulled their children from Sex 
Respect in 1990 and 2,500 parents, educators and students signed a petition 
condemning it. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Enfield, Conn., the school district started a Sex Respect pilot program, 
which it rejected in 1990 after a parents group complained that it taught fear, 
guilt and shame. 
</P>
<P>
 * Last August, school trustees in Modesto narrowly voted to drop Sex Respect 
after a five-year run. Their stand placed them at odds with the program's local 
proponents, who fell short in a recall campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 * In California, the program is under review by the state Department of 
Education, which is trying to determine if Sex Respect falls short of meeting 
AIDS education requirements in a new state law. 
</P>
<P>
 The state mandates the teaching of such subjects as math and science. It does 
not mandate the teaching of sex education, per se. Local districts are given 
broad latitude in how such a subject is taught or whether it is taught. 
</P>
<P>
 Religious bias and a lack of scientific data are among the chief criticisms 
leveled at Sex Respect and the author of its text, Coleen Kelly Mast. She 
developed the text with the help of a $300,000 grant given to the Committee on 
the Status of Women by the Ronald Reagan Administration in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee lost federal funding a year later after settlement of a lawsuit 
that accused the government of using tax dollars to support programs that were 
more religious than educational. 
</P>
<P>
 Mast failed to return phone calls to her headquarters in Bradley, Ill. In a 
videotaped speech to Catholic educators, she said: "This is not me up here. I'm 
weak, a pile of dust. Really, it's the Holy Spirit that reaches these kids. . . 
. We're fighting a war against sin, a war against offenses to God." 
</P>
<P>
 She and her husband operate Respect, Inc., a for-profit corporation that 
carries a line of "Stop at the Lips" T-shirts, "I'M WORTH WAITING FOR" buttons 
and a Chastity Challenge home video. Her supporters include the Rev. Pat 
Robertson and Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents complain that the program is inaccurate. Bryan, the Hemet parent, 
said a reference in one chapter of the Sex Respect book attributes AIDS-related 
data to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta "unless otherwise noted." 
"But in the chapter," Bryan said, "there's only one reference from CDC. The 
others are from some other unreliable source. My biggest beef, though, is Mrs. 
Park telling students in her class that French kissing can give you AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the text devotes four chapters to arguing that AIDS can be spread by 
French kissing and says that "anyone can be carrying your death warrant." A 
section called "Sex Tips for a Safe Date" commands teens to "keep all of your 
clothes all the way on all of the time. Don't let any part of anyone else's 
body get anywhere between you and your clothes. AVOID AROUSAL." 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Kolbe, director of the division of adolescent and school health for the 
Centers for Disease Control, said many of the messages of Sex Respect -- such 
as AIDS being spread through French kissing -- "are the last things young 
people in school need to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
 However, there exists "a remote possibility that the virus can be infected 
that way. But what we need to focus on is helping young people develop the 
skills they're going to need to delay intercourse -- and if they do have sex -- 
how to correctly and consistently use condoms." 
</P>
<P>
 Forty percent of U.S. ninth-graders have had intercourse, Kolbe said, with the 
figures increasing dramatically through high school; 70% of all seniors have 
had sex. One of eight ninth-graders has had four or more partners, while among 
seniors the figure leaps to one of four. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ideal if kids are abstinent, but that message hasn't worked for the past 
10,000 years," said Dr. Sheldon Zablow, a San Diego psychiatrist who 
specializes in children and adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
 "By teaching contraception, we're not going to say it's OK to have sex, but 
rather, 'You need to know what's going to happen if. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
 Zablow dismisses as "sheer propaganda" the program's message that boys are 
more easily aroused than girls. "Society allows girls to talk more freely about 
sexual and emotional feelings, therefore, boys are more apt to act out," he 
said. "Repeated studies show that if you try to repress sexual feelings, they 
may come out later in far more dangerous ways -- sexual abuse, rape. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 But Park says that in many cases the critics of Sex Respect have overreacted. 
She says the course "centers around the idea that humans being really can 
control their behavior, including sexual behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 "It teaches kids how to date, and that they don't have to be sexually active," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The students in Park's class appear to support her wholeheartedly. Some even 
see themselves as the victims of sex before marriage. Had her parents saved 
themselves until their wedding night, a 12-year-old said quietly, maybe they 
would have stayed married. 
</P>
<P>
 One boy said: "I don't want to throw my life away, not like the 15-year-old 
girl I know who got pregnant and had to drop out. I can't imagine anything more 
horrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents say Sex Respect is needed because, in Park's words, so many 
messages encourage premarital sex. To "force-feed students talk of 
contraception" is to whet their appetites for sex, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jennifer Cusworth, 16, a junior at Hemet High School and one of Park's 
former students, disagreed, saying a 10th-grade social psychology course that 
dealt heavily with contraception taught her "100% more than Sex Respect ever 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 Cusworth said she likes Park and considers her a "good person." But she 
dismisses Sex Respect as "nothing more than a church sermon." 
</P>
<P>
 "She told us you could get AIDS from French kissing, and when I heard that 
wasn't exactly true, I just didn't think much of the rest of it," Cusworth 
said. "In the end, I didn't know what to believe."

U.S. EXPECTS TO CITE JAPAN FOR TRADE VIOLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With trade talks broken off, a White House official said Monday that the 
Clinton Administration expects today to declare Japan in violation of a 
telecommunications agreement -- a move that could pave the way for sanctions 
against the Japanese and escalate a trade dispute between the world's two 
largest economies. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton warned Japan on Monday not to embark on a tit-for-tat trade 
war, saying, "I think they would have to think long and hard about it." 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials said that the decision to cite Japan for interfering 
with a 1989 agreement allowing Motorola Inc. to sell cellular telephone service 
in the Tokyo vicinity is not tied directly to Friday's breakdown in 
U.S.-Japanese trade negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the deadline for action today provided a convenient, if coincidental, 
opportunity to begin the sort of retaliatory and punitive measures that 
Administration officials said last week were under consideration, and the 
souring state of Washington's trade relations with Tokyo gives added weight to 
the Motorola decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the talks Friday between Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa gone well, there would have been little likelihood that the 
Administration would take such action today, regardless of the merits of 
Motorola's complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is clearly a warning shot," said a congressional source familiar with 
the Administration's plans. "It is a very low point from which to escalate." 
</P>
<P>
 With the declaration, specific punitive action against Japan can follow. 
Placing tariffs on Japanese communications products sold in this country is one 
measure that could be taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the fallout of the trade dispute landed on foreign currency markets 
Monday. The dollar fell in value by roughly 3% compared with the yen -- making 
Japanese products more expensive in the United States and U.S. goods cheaper in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that more dramatic steps than those anticipated in the Motorola 
case are contemplated, perhaps as early as next week, in a campaign to put 
greater pressure on Japan. Senior officials are expected to meet on an almost 
daily basis to plot their strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is trying to persuade Tokyo to take specific steps in 
compliance with an agreement reached last July to devise objective criteria 
that could be used to measure progress in opening Japanese markets to foreign 
products. The agreement covers automobiles and auto parts, insurance and 
government purchases of telecommunications and medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement is intended to begin reducing Japan's $132-billion global trade 
surplus, nearly $60 billion of it with the United States. In its annual 
economic report, the Clinton Administration said, however, that removal of all 
of the barriers Japan erects to keep out foreign products would reduce the 
United States' trade deficit with Japan by only $9 billion to $18 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa, whose call for continued talks was rejected by the United States on 
Friday, said after his meeting with Clinton that the two sides needed a 
cooling-off period. U.S. officials said they would remain open to new proposals 
from Japan but that they must adhere to the July agreement -- and that, barring 
such progress, the United States considers itself free to take specific steps 
to put pressure on Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 These measures include the likely reintroduction of a trade-code provision, 
known as Super 301, that could lead to the exclusion of certain Japanese 
products from the United States, the imposition of strict inspection standards 
on Japanese autos, the scaling back on tax benefits given to Japanese auto 
makers in the United States and the stepping up of the use of U.S. laws 
prohibiting the "dumping" on U.S. markets of products sold at prices below 
their production costs to undercut U.S. manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Super 301 provision was part of trade legislation passed by Congress in 
1988. It was particularly disliked by Japan because it required an annual 
review of trade barriers abroad and mandated U.S. retaliation if the barriers 
were not lifted. The law expired in 1990, but Clinton could reimpose it with an 
executive order. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton told reporters he would "make a decision within a few days" on whether 
to take other steps against Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to portray the dispute not as one between the United States and Japan 
but as one between those who seek more open markets worldwide and Japan, the 
President said: 
</P>
<P>
 "For those of you who worry about a trade war and other things, this is a 
battle that is raging not just in the United States and in Europe and in all 
other parts of the world that have been exposed to the mercantilist policies of 
Japan. This is a battle that is raging in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Motorola case involves an effort by the communications company to sell 
cellular telephones in a 155-mile swath from Tokyo southwest to Nagoya, 
according to Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who chairs the White House Council of 
Economic Advisers. She described it as a classic example of Japan's efforts to 
keep foreign companies from gaining a foothold in its lucrative market. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Japanese claim that U.S. firms don't try hard enough and that the quality 
of the U.S. products isn't there," a senior Administration official said.

BACK UP BOSNIA THREAT, U.S. ENVOY TELLS U.N. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Trumpeting the new resolve of the Clinton Administration, U.S. Ambassador 
Madeleine Albright told the U.N. Security Council on Monday that diplomacy will 
not stop the slaughter in Sarajevo or the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina unless it 
is "backed by a willingness to use force." 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech to the council during an unusual public session, the American 
ambassador also added a new warning to the Bosnian Serbs: that they will face 
retribution if they attempt to harm foreign relief workers in retaliation for 
any North Atlantic Treaty Organization air raids. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States will advocate strong action by this council if the Bosnian 
Serbs follow through on their threats to restrict the movement of international 
relief workers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As more than 40 ambassadors filled the council chamber with rhetoric railing 
against the savagery in Bosnia, both President Clinton and the United Nations 
denied reports that the international organization intends to ease NATO's 
demand that the Serbs -- under threat of air strikes -- withdraw all heavy 
weapons from the Sarajevo area or turn them over to the United Nations by next 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 News reports had indicated that some U.N. peacekeeping officers would be 
satisfied if the Serbs simply left their artillery batteries in place for 
distant U.N. monitoring by radar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect that the terms of the NATO agreement will be followed," Clinton told 
a news conference. "Keep in mind, the secretary general of the United Nations 
asked us to take action. We agreed to take action. . . . And we were assured 
all along the way that our allies in NATO and . . . the secretary general 
agreed. So, I don't believe there is a fundamental misunderstanding on that 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Sills, spokesman for Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, said in a 
news briefing at U.N. headquarters that "there is no difference in the goals 
being pursued by the U.N. and NATO." 
</P>
<P>
 That seemed underscored in Sarajevo, where Lt. Gen. Michael Rose of Britain, 
commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia, said that "the total exclusion zone for 
heavy weapons around Sarajevo will be implemented" before the end of the week 
and that "any heavy weapons there will be either under U.N. control or subject 
of an air attack." 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbs, however, were a long way from turning over their weapons. Two 
artillery pieces were handed to peacekeepers Monday, bringing the total under 
U.N. control to 28. Some analysts estimate that the Serbs have more than 500 
heavy weapons around Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said in Washington that the few pieces of artillery and other 
heavy weapons that the Serbs had turned in during the previous 24 hours were 
"not significant." "Most of what they were turning in was old, not 
serviceable," one said. "All we've really deprived them of is spare parts." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Charles Redman, special U.S. envoy to the Bosnia peace talks in 
Geneva, met with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in Sarajevo at the start 
of a two-day visit. 
</P>
<P>
 It is assumed that Redman is trying to explore all facets of Bosnia's 
bargaining position at the negotiations. The Clinton Administration, while 
calling for air strikes in Sarajevo if the Serbs fail to withdraw or neutralize 
their heavy weapons, has promised its European allies, in a change of policy, 
to take an active part in the peace negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, the German government announced the arrest in Munich 
of 38-year-old Dusko Tadic, a Bosnian Serb prison guard accused of torturing 
and murdering Muslims in Bosnian detention camps. In denouncing the alleged 
crimes of Tadic and others like him in Bosnia, the German Federal Prosecutor's 
Office said, "Through murder, rape, deportation and the obliteration of whole 
villages, those responsible are pursuing a goal of decimating the non-Serb 
populace." 
</P>
<P>
 The public debate in the Security Council was called at the request of Bosnia 
and several nonaligned governments to discuss the situation in the wake of the 
bloody massacre in a Sarajevo marketplace Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian diplomats joined in the request, seeking to discuss their proposal for 
a U.N. administration in Sarajevo. The council agreed to allow any U.N. member 
to speak, but it ruled that no resolution would be taken up at the session. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting began with Bosnia's U.N. ambassador, Muhamed Sacirbey, hailing the 
threat of air strikes. "For those who only understand the language of force and 
the logic of war," he said, "this step will be the first to counter their 
aggression and terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
 Fears had arisen last week that Russian Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov would use a 
council meeting to try to eliminate the threat to bomb artillery positions of 
the Serbs, who are longtime political and cultural allies of Russia. But, in 
the face of NATO solidarity, the Russians abandoned the maneuver at the end of 
last week, and Vorontsov told the council that a Russian proposal for a U.N. 
administration in Sarajevo is a complement to the air strike threat, not a 
substitute. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian position drew praise from both Albright and French Ambassador 
Jean-Bernard Merimee. "We are happy to state that we share the same position," 
Merimee told Vorontsov. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the good feelings expressed in the Security Council even enveloped 
the United States and France. The two nations had been jousting over Bosnia 
policy several weeks ago. But they embraced each other's positions after the 
Sarajevo marketplace massacre enraged the world and persuaded leaders in both 
countries that something had to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 British Ambassador David Hannay sounded a central theme of the session when he 
stressed that, while the threat of air strikes is real, the need for a 
negotiated settlement is vital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Delay and procrastination do not, in Bosnia, lead to things getting better," 
he said. "They lead to them getting worse."

LOBBYIST GIVEN 6 1/2-YEAR TERM IN CORRUPTION CASE; CAPITOL: CLAYTON JACKSON IS 
ORDERED INTO IMMEDIATE CUSTODY. CO-DEFENDANT PAUL CARPENTER REMAINS A FUGITIVE.

<P>
 A federal court judge Monday sentenced lobbyist Clayton R. Jackson to 6 1/2 
years in prison on political corruption charges and ordered him into immediate 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. John Vincent had sought a nine-year sentence for the 
former top insurance industry lobbyist, convicted in December on 10 counts of 
racketeering, mail fraud and money-laundering. Vincent said he is pleased with 
the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has to be a message sent," Vincent said. "These cases are 
excruciatingly difficult to investigate, and when we are successful in showing 
corruption it is important that a stern sentence be meted out so that people . 
. . will think twice about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The whereabouts of Jackson's co-defendant, former state Sen. Paul B. 
Carpenter, remained a mystery, Vincent said. Carpenter, also scheduled for 
sentencing Monday, disappeared last week and apparently fled the country to be 
treated for terminal cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Edward J. Garcia last week issued a warrant for 
Carpenter's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Garcia said he did not believe Jackson was a risk to flee but 
turned down a plea for bail from Jackson's lawyer, Donald H. Heller, saying 
that to allow him extra time "would only delay the inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned this case has run its course," Garcia said, noting 
that Jackson "received a fair trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Before being whisked away by federal marshals, the 6-foot-6-inch, blue-suited 
Jackson declined to make a statement to Garcia and a courtroom jammed with his 
friends, family, lobbying associates and other supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Heller predicted that an appellate court will release Jackson, 50, and order a 
new trial, saying the government, with the help of former Sen. Alan Robbins 
(D-Van Nuys), had entrapped the kingpin lobbyist, whose firm once earned $2 
million a year from an array of blue chip clients -- more than any other in the 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system of justice in my view has gone out of control in the effort to 
clean up corruption, so to speak, in the California Legislature," said Heller, 
who expressed surprise that his client was immediately taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Defendants in all the other capital corruption cases were given time to report 
to prison and some were allowed to remain free pending the outcome of their 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who lived in Mill Valley and practiced law in San Francisco, also 
faces loss of his attorney's license. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Vincent made it clear that the federal corruption probe, begun a 
decade ago, is ongoing. Eleven other Capitol figures, including Robbins and 
former state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), have been convicted or are 
awaiting trial in connection with the federal probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's sentence of 6 1/2 years is similar to Montoya's. Garcia said he 
could have sentenced Jackson to a longer term but chose to be lenient because 
he was impressed by Jackson's community involvement and letters from 171 
backers, including lobbyists and lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent said that with time off for good behavior, Jackson could be out in 
about 5 1/2 years. In addition to the prison time, Jackson must pay a $50,000 
fine and submit to supervision for three years once he is released. However, a 
condition sought by federal parole officials to limit Jackson's lobbying upon 
release was dropped by Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to Jackson's sentence, Robbins, who resigned his office in 1991 
and pleaded guilty to corruption charges, spent about 18 months in prison and 
is scheduled to be released from a Hollywood halfway house March 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins was the government's star witness against Jackson and Carpenter. The 
prosecution relied heavily on tapes Robbins secretly recorded of conversations 
with Jackson in the summer of 1991 and on his testimony about 
influence-peddling in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 In his testimony, Robbins said Jackson had been bribing him for many years 
before the undercover investigation. A key piece of the case was a tape of a 
conversation in which Jackson offered to pay Robbins $250,000 to switch 
jurisdiction of controversial workers' compensation legislation to a committee 
chaired by Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also pegged much of their case on testimony about an elaborate 
money-laundering scheme designed to illegally benefit Robbins and his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Heller again told reporters that Robbins was not believable. He 
assailed the former lawmaker as "an absolute, complete scumbag" and said "when 
you take a man like Alan Robbins and use him as a lever to extort, in my view 
that's outrageous government conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia made only passing reference to Carpenter, 65, once a powerful lawmaker 
who represented parts of Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Garcia postmarked from the Detroit area, with copies to his 
lawyer and a Times reporter, Carpenter said: "I find my drive for survival 
stronger than my sense of obligation to your legal system." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, FBI agents were distributing a postcard-size wanted notice with 
Carpenter's photograph and a detailed description of the fugitive, who suffers 
from terminal prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his flight, Carpenter remains entitled to state retirement benefits of 
$1,842 a month, deposited electronically into a bank account, according to 
Robert D. Walton, assistant executive director of the Public Employees' 
Retirement System. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislation passed in the 1970s prevents an indicted fugitive from accruing 
additional benefits, but once vested a public official cannot have his pension 
taken away. Such benefits, Walton said, "are contracted rights. They can't be 
impaired."

QUAKE FORCES L.A. TO DROP POLITICAL CONVENTIONS BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles will drop its campaign to be host of the 1996 Democratic and 
Republican national conventions because the city cannot afford to stage the 
political extravaganzas in the wake of last month's earthquake, Mayor Richard 
Riordan announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said in a statement that he was disappointed but that he had to 
terminate the city's bids because of the substantial public investment that 
would have been required. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee lobbying for the Democratic conclave in 1996 had estimated that it 
would cost at least $22.5 million to convert the Los Angeles Convention Center 
into an arena -- complete with podium and network television sky boxes -- and 
to provide housing and office space for the convention staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has not calculated the cost of holding the Republican convention, but 
even preliminary estimates made either event too pricey for a city that faces a 
$150-million deficit, and the potential loss of more than $66 million in tax 
revenue from businesses damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given our fiscal priority for the recovery of all of Los Angeles and for 
making our city safe, we cannot guarantee millions of public dollars" for the 
conventions, Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Riordan and other civic boosters had hoped that having one or both 
conventions would be a psychological balm for a city riven in the last two 
years by recession and a string of disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tragic aspects of this (earthquake) only sort of multiply," said one 
mayoral adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles had been considered a front-runner for the Democratic convention. 
With the city and state still mired in an economic downturn, the Clinton 
Administration has gone to great lengths to boost the region's fortunes. Many 
Democrats believe that holding the convention in Los Angeles -- the site of the 
nomination in 1960 of John F. Kennedy -- would be important symbolically in 
Clinton's effort to hold California in the Democratic column in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very strong candidates," said Alice Travis, director of party and 
government affairs for the Democratic National Committee. "Certainly, we are 
disappointed that Los Angeles can't continue in the bidding process." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Press, who chairs the California Democratic Party, said he was sure the 
city would have won the convention if it had the money. "This convention would 
have come to Los Angeles, without doubt, because it made the most sense for the 
President," Press said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline for bids for the Democratic convention is at the end of this 
month. A White House aide said that Chicago is now a favorite for the event, 
although New Orleans, San Antonio, Kansas City, Mo., and New York are 
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline for the Republican convention bids is not until April and the 
competition for that gathering is said to be more wide open. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan had chosen prominent party members four months ago to form committees 
to bid for the political gatherings. He cited figures that the 1992 Democratic 
convention had infused $188 million into the New York City economy and that the 
Republican convention the same year pumped $140 million into Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 A post-Watergate reform measure requires that money spent on the conventions 
come from public funds. This was an attempt to prevent large private interests 
from tainting the outcomes of the conventions where presidential candidates are 
nominated. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said it would be too much to ask city residents to pay to sponsor the 
events, despite the benefits, with all the other bills coming due. 
</P>
<P>
 One key Riordan adviser noted that the mayor would have to seek the money as 
he enters a crucial phase of his first year in office -- the presentation to 
the City Council of his first full budget. In addition to the deficit and 
earthquake expenses, Riordan's plan to beef up the police force is estimated to 
cost $90 million in the fiscal year that begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a hell of a fight on the budget and the earthquake only made 
the mountain that much steeper," said the adviser, who asked not to be named. 
"The mayor wanted this, he really wanted this. It's important for the city 
psychologically. But it's just not appropriate at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council adopted a resolution Friday to help obtain 
tax-exempt status for the two committees lobbying for the convention. They were 
going to raise funds privately to promote the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But even those efforts were likely to run into trouble, said City Council 
President John Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
 "Times are tough, not only for the city of Los Angeles, but for all the 
businesses here that we would rely on to raise that money," Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's statement touted the city's "family attractions, beautiful beaches, 
and flawless humidity-free summer weather," predicting that Los Angeles will be 
financially robust enough to have both conventions in 2000.

QUAKE-RAVAGED CSUN REOPENS AMID CONFUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Cal State Northridge's portable university began its spring semester Monday, 
two weeks late and plagued by unusable temporary classrooms and confusion as 
15,000 students struggled to find their way on the earthquake-racked campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Students and teachers found two of the 198 temporary buildings had burned down 
and many others were dark and missing furniture as the university tried to 
rebound from the magnitude 6.8 earthquake that caused an estimated $350 million 
in damage to the campus. It was believed to be the most devastating natural 
disaster ever to strike an American college. 
</P>
<P>
 While there were many problems linking students up with classrooms in the 
unlikeliest locations -- "Political science, your class is meeting in front of 
a blue Dumpster," a campus police officer shouted over a bullhorn -- a number 
of state and local officials showed up to celebrate the achievement of 
reopening the campus at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking by phone to a rally attended by more than 100 students and campus 
officials, President Clinton praised the Cal State Northridge staff for getting 
the school back on its feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe . . . you're back open a month later. It's a real tribute to 
you. I'm glad to hear the California spirit is alive and well," Clinton said to 
the cheers of students during a 15-minute phone interview on the Michael 
Jackson talk show on KABC radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan appeared in a CSUN T-shirt emblazoned with 
the campus' post-earthquake motto -- "Not Just Back . . . Better" -- a slogan 
that was challenged by an unforgiving reality Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Credited, and occasionally denounced, for the quick reopening was Cal State 
Northridge President Blenda J. Wilson, who made the decision shortly after the 
Jan. 17 quake to remake CSUN as a university in a box -- or clusters of boxes. 
The school's revival "has been the most extraordinary experience of my life," 
she told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief reference to the chaos surrounding her, Wilson said, "Clearly, it 
will take us a couple days to get the bugs out of this new place." 
</P>
<P>
 The semester was supposed to have begun Jan. 31 but the Northridge quake two 
weeks earlier put all nine primary classroom buildings out of commission. Of 
the 53 major campus buildings, fewer than 15 were in use Monday morning. Among 
the most hard-hit was the Oviatt Library, the largest building on campus. 
Students who need to do research will be taken by bus to UCLA, an hour's 
shuttle ride away. 
</P>
<P>
 To make up for lost course time, the spring break will be eliminated and the 
semester will be extended a week. 
</P>
<P>
 While there was much confusion and difficulty in getting the students together 
with their instructors -- many teachers did little beyond promising their 
students that next time it would be better -- some students seemed to take the 
problems in relatively good humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a comical situation," said Scott Mason Jr., 34, a business major who 
arrived for his 7 a.m. finance class to find that his modular classroom had no 
desks, chairs, electrical power or heat. There were no stairs so students had 
to climb in through a door three feet off the ground, and there was no sign 
identifying the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Others were not so lighthearted. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Taub, 20, of North Hills, arrived an hour before his 9 a.m. class to 
begin hunting for classroom 1326. Trying to follow a map, he went in one 
direction, then in another, looking for his class in the maze of portable 
buildings set up in athletic fields and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 After asking directions twice, he finally arrived, out of breath and just in 
time to answer "Here!" when his name was called. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is . . . hell!" another lost student shouted out. While the students and 
teachers wandered around amid the clusters of buildings, workers continued 
installing electrical wiring. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the anxiety was a magnitude 3.3 aftershock, which rolled through the 
campus at 12:32 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Neumeyer, Taub's teacher, shouted over the roar of a generator that 
she would be teaching concepts for the first three weeks because no writing 
could be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome to a new adventure," she said. "This is the computer center, but we 
don't have computers. We don't know when we will get computers, or if we will 
get computers at all this semester." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Ho, a 22-year-old business major, waited three hours for his 7 a.m. class. 
Finally, at 10 a.m., a man in a hard hat kicked him out of the trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got up at 6 a.m. to get here and stood around for three hours. They should 
have waited until they set up everything before they tell us to come back," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One much-anticipated problem, that traffic and parking would be a nightmare 
because of the collapse of the largest parking structure on campus, failed to 
materialize. Streets in surrounding neighborhoods that are usually closed to 
parking were opened up. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people had to wait as long as 30 minutes for a spot, but a shuttle system 
set up by the university appeared to work well bringing students to campus from 
outlying parking areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Once students made it to the 353-acre campus, attendants at 22 information 
booths gave them directions. More than 24,500 students, about 1,500 fewer than 
last spring, were signed up for classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The classroom situation turned out to be much worse than anticipated. As late 
as Sunday, university officials were assuring people that all portables would 
be in place Monday morning. But the rooms were still arriving Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, many of the temporary buildings already on campus were not ready for 
occupancy. Officials estimated that 120 classrooms, about a third of the total, 
were out of service Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said she did not regret pushing the deadline. If it had not been for 
the rain and then the high winds in recent weeks all the portables would have 
been in place, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the portables burned down Sunday morning. Rolando Canche, 19, 
discovered this when he went looking for his Chicano studies class and instead 
found his professor, Alberto Garcia, holding class in an open field. Fire 
officials have labeled the blaze suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the general disarray Monday, the university's chief spokesman, Bruce 
Erickson, said jokingly, "Problems? What problems? It looks like the typical 
first day after an earthquake to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Erickson added, "It could have been much more chaotic than it is. It was 
a gamble. It was not a foregone conclusion that we were going to be able to 
open." 
</P>
<P>
 Dust from construction blew into the faces of students waiting more than two 
hours in a long line at the Student Union -- converted into temporary 
administration offices -- for their financial aid checks. More than $8 million 
in financial aid had been trapped in the damaged administration building. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been exhilarating," said Freddy Brown, a six-year staff member in the 
student aid business office. "These kids out here -- few of them have been 
impatient considering the circumstances they have been going through -- they 
are great sports." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan to reopen Cal State Northridge in temporary quarters was put into 
action Jan. 27, when Wilson gave the go-ahead to bring in hundreds of portable 
buildings from as far away as Northern California and Nevada. Construction 
teams worked around the clock anchoring the buildings in place and Gov. Pete 
Wilson waived state regulations so that the extra-wide portable buildings could 
be hauled at night to make the deadline for the reopening. 
</P>
<P>
 There were those, however, who felt the deadline should have been extended. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sharon Eisenberg, a 20-year-old junior majoring in communications 
studies, began her search for her 8 a.m. psychology class, she was in good 
spirits. But that mood wore away, along with the soles of her shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy, I'm really late for my class and I might be dropped. I'm really 
nervous," she groused to one of the campus guides, who was unable to help her. 
</P>
<P>
 That was enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "This school is insane. You can quote me on that. I should have transferred to 
San Diego State when I had a chance."

VIACOM APPARENT VICTOR IN BATTLE TO BUY PARAMOUNT; MEDIA: MAJORITY OF 
SHAREHOLDERS SPURN THE OFFER OF RIVAL QVC, SOURCES SAY. BIDDING FOR HOLLYWOOD'S 
LAST INDEPENDENT MAJOR STUDIO EXCEEDED $10 BILLION. 
</P>

<P>
 Viacom Inc. appeared Monday to have won the contentious five-month battle for 
Paramount Communications Inc., sources said, after a majority of shareholders 
accepted its offer to acquire the entertainment giant. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition between Viacom and QVC Network Inc. pitted some of America's 
wealthiest media titans, as both companies jockeyed for advantage in the 
$10-billion-plus bidding for Paramount, owner of Hollywood's last independent 
major studio. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no formal concession from QVC Monday as the midnight deadline in New 
York passed, but the home shopping network is expected to withdraw its 
competing tender offer this morning. Under the auction rules both bidders 
accepted, victory goes to the company which receives 50.1% of Paramount shares. 
By 10 p.m. EST, at least 70 million Paramount shares (of nearly 120 million 
shares outstanding) had been tendered to Viacom, sources said. Those who 
tendered shares to QVC will have until March 1 to switch to Viacom. 
</P>
<P>
 As proxy solicitators counted the shares Monday night, QVC Chairman Barry 
Diller was en route from Los Angeles to New York. QVC sources indicated that 
they expected Viacom to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom's tenacious 70-year-old chairman, Sumner M. Redstone, for his part, 
refused to claim a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until Paramount certifies the winner, there is no winner," he said before 
hosting a birthday party for his wife at New York's tony "21" restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 But Redstone added: "If we're fortunate enough to have Paramount . . . my 
comment would be that it was a marriage made in heaven, dragged through hell on 
the way to consummation." 
</P>
<P>
 Only now can Redstone make light of his marriage analogies made on Sept. 12, 
when he and Paramount Chairman Martin S. Davis announced a friendly merger 
agreement of the two companies in a deal that would have cost about $2 billion 
less. 
</P>
<P>
 Redstone sweetened his bid four times before finally proposing what appears to 
be the winning offer on Feb. 1. The turning point came in January, when Viacom 
struck a deal to merge with Blockbuster Entertainment, the video rental giant. 
That produced another $1.25 billion to keep Viacom in the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom offered to pay $107 per share for 50.1% of Paramount, compared to $104 
per share offered by QVC. Although QVC offered a more valuable package of 
securities for the remaining 49% of Paramount, Viacom won by offering some 
protection against a decline in the value of its shares in the two-year period 
following the merger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sumner kept coming," marveled Comcast President Brian Roberts, a QVC investor 
and ardent supporter of its Paramount bid. "Every time you could taste victory, 
he came back." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Roberts said, Diller balked at the idea of borrowing $1 billion to 
provide protection for the value of QVC's stock. Diller is at heart an 
operator, Roberts noted, and he did not want to burden QVC with short-term debt 
that would require refinancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have said that both companies already had offered too much for 
Paramount, exposing the victor to years of burdensome debt payments. But 
Redstone maintains that the Viacom deal is not nearly as leverged as his 
successful buyout of Viacom in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, criticism sharpened Monday of the Blockbuster-Viacom meger, with one 
institutional investor giving it at best a 50-50 chance of completion. The 
criticism centered on the high cost of Paramount. Others, however, maintain 
this is still Blockbuster's best "exit strategy" from its dependence on video 
retailing. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming no unexpected complications arise, Viacom's takeover of Paramount may 
still take months to formally complete. Paramount Chairman Davis is expected to 
remain on board until power formally changes hands in the takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 Diller is expected to regroup before possibly setting his sights on another 
major target. 
</P>
<P>
 The entertainment executive launched his rival offer Sept. 20, with backing 
from Comcast and Liberty Media Corp., which is controlled by cable TV titan 
John C. Malone. 
</P>
<P>
 Redstone decried the QVC bid, particularly because it came from Diller, whom 
he counted as a close Hollywood friend. In private conversations, Redstone 
complained that Diller would just end up forcing him to spend a lot more money 
-- which is precisely what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Diller, however, was well-received on Wall Street because of his exemplary 
track record as a studio executive. Diller ran the Paramount studio for 10 
years until he moved to Fox Inc. in 1984, where he confounded skeptics by 
creating a profitable fourth television network. In 1992, Diller quit Fox in 
order to search for a company he could control with a greater equity stake. His 
quest led to Pennsylvania-based home shopping QVC Network, where he formed a 
voting partnership with Comcast and Liberty Media. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after QVC launched its bid, Redstone retaliated with a sweeping 
antitrust lawsuit against Liberty Media and its much-larger affiliate, 
Tele-Communications Inc., which together serve nearly one out of every five 
cable TV households in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal antitrust regulators soon raised objections to TCI's role in the QVC 
bid. Finally, TCI's Malone agreed to bow out, allowing QVC to recruit new 
investors for the Paramount bid. Diller ultimately tapped BellSouth Corp., Cox 
Enterprises and Advance Publications as partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Once QVC abandons its quest for Paramount, BellSouth, Cox and Advance will 
still have the option of investing in QVC. QVC sources said Monday they expect 
Malone to remain a QVC investor -- even though TCI has its own mergers pending 
with Liberty Media and Bell Atlantic Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got Malone back as a partner again," said one gleeful QVC board member. 
And a second director affirmed that the Malone-Diller relationship looks solid 
-- though both directors spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom will prorate the cash among all Paramount shareholders who tender their 
stock. Shareholders should receive their cash in March, but Viacom cannot issue 
securities for the remaining 49% until its proposal clears the Securities and 
Exchange Commission and a proxy is mailed to shareholders. Viacom's acquisition 
of Paramount could be completed about the same time Viacom completes a pending 
merger with Blockbuster Entertainment, company sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 In trading Monday, Paramount closed at $76, down 87.5 cents. Viacom A shares 
fell $1.625 to $34.875 -- the lowest the stock has closed since Nov. 5, 1992. 
Viacom B shares closed at $29.875, down $1.75. Viacom's two backers also saw 
their stock prices decline, with Blockbuster Entertainment closing down $1 at 
$24.75 and Nynex down 37.5 cents at $38. 
</P>
<P>
 QVC rose $1.625 to $48.50. Comcast added 75 cents to $21, while BellSouth 
Corp. -- which had pledged $2 bllion to the QVC bid -- declined $1.25 to $56. 
</P>
<P>
 If QVC had won Paramount, BellSouth would have emerged as the largest 
shareholder with nearly 18.2% of the stock. There were indications Monday that 
some QVC investors were relieved that BellSouth would not have the option of 
playing such a big role. Without a Paramount victory, BellSouth has just a 
six-month option to purchase $500 million of QVC's common stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the final week of the contest, there were reports that BellSouth 
and the other partners might announce a plan to buy QVC shares in the weeks 
ahead, which would support the value of the QVC bid. The message alternately 
intrigued and vexed Wall Street traders, but on Sunday QVC announced that it 
would not be raising its bid. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement penned by Diller himself, QVC declared its eagerness to manage 
Paramount, and urged shareholders to consider the long-term merits of its 
offer. "We hope we will be doing that work and if we do, then we'll shut up and 
get on with it," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 If QVC had prevailed, Diller was expected to sell Paramount's television 
stations, theme parks and perhaps other assets -- which include one of the 
nation's biggest book publishing operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Diller reportedly opposed Paramount's plan to launch a new TV network with 
Chris-Craft Industries and other independent stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom Chief Executive Frank Biondi, Redstone's second in command, is expected 
to retain that positon with the new company. Viacom has been more circumspect 
about its broader plans, but it is less likely to sell assets. Redstone, for 
one, is an eager proponent of opening stores to sell Viacom's MTV and 
Nickelodeon merchandise, which will be boosted considerably by Paramount 
products. Redstone has repeatedly cited Blockbuster's expertise in video 
retailing as one of the greatest aspects of that pending merger. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Redstone admitted that Viacom still has not settled on a name for the 
Paramount-Viacom-Blockbuster entity, if both mergers are completed, although 
one possible name that has surfaced is Paramount Viacom International. 
</P>
<P>
 With its Nickelodeon franchise in children's programming, Viacom is likely to 
keep Paramount's Computer Curriculum subsidary in Silicon Valley, which 
produces computer-based learning systems for schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the battle, Diller took enormous pains to conduct an honorable 
battle. His greatest mistake may have been his polite overture to Paramount, 
when he repeatedly asked the board to consider his offer. 
</P>
<P>
 QVC might have gained the advantage by launching a hostile tender offer 
immediately, but Diller preferred to try to negotiate. Spurned, he had to take 
his case to the Delaware courts. 
</P>
<P>
 * RELATED STORIES: A11 A Mega-Merger 
</P>
<P>
 The merging of Paramount Communications Inc. and Viacom Inc, along with the 
expected addition of Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., will create the world's 
fifth-largest entertainment company. With the exception of some overlapping 
sports holdings, the three companies' business operations appear to be mostly 
compatible. Although the hurdles of regulatory approval still need to be 
crossed, it's considered unlikely that the merger will present serious 
problems.

 Viacom-Blockbuster and QVC are both offering cash amounts for 50.1% of 
Paramount stock and packages of warrants and securities for the remaining

<P>
 Cal State Northridge's portable university began its spring semester Monday, 
two weeks late and plagued by unusable temporary classrooms and confusion as 
about 15,000 students struggled to find their way on the earthquake-wracked 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Students and teachers found that two of the 198 temporary buildings had burned 
down, and many others lacked electricity and furniture. The university 
sustained an estimated $350 million in damage from last month's 6.8-magnitude 
quake, believed to be the most devastating natural disaster ever to strike an 
American college. 
</P>
<P>
 While there were many problems linking students with classrooms held in 
unlikely locations -- "Political science, your class is meeting in front of a 
blue Dumpster," a campus police officer shouted over a bullhorn -- a number of 
state and local officials showed up to celebrate the campus' reopening. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking by phone to a rally attended by more than 100 students and campus 
officials, President Clinton praised the CSUN staff for getting the school back 
on its feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe . . . you're back open a month later. It's a real tribute to 
you. I'm glad to hear the California spirit is alive and well," Clinton said to 
the cheers of students during a 15-minute phone interview on the Michael 
Jackson radio talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan appeared in a CSUN T-shirt emblazoned with 
the campus's post-earthquake motto -- "Not Just Back . . . Better" -- a slogan 
that was challenged by an unforgiving reality Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Credited, and occasionally denounced, for the quick reopening was CSUN 
President Blenda J. Wilson, who made the decision shortly after the Jan. 17 
quake to remake Cal State Northridge as a university in a box -- or clusters of 
boxes. The revival of CSUN "has been the most extraordinary experience of my 
life," she told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief reference to the chaos surrounding her, Wilson said, "Clearly, it 
will take us a couple days to get the bugs out of this new place." 
</P>
<P>
 The semester was supposed to begin Jan. 31, but the Northridge quake put out 
of commission all nine major classroom buildings. Of the 53 major campus 
buildings, fewer than 15 were in use Monday morning. Among the most hard-hit is 
the Oviatt Library. Now, students who need to do research may be taken by bus 
to UCLA, an hour's shuttle ride away. 
</P>
<P>
 To make up for the lost classroom time, the spring break will be eliminated 
and the semester will be extended a week. 
</P>
<P>
 There was so much confusion and difficulty getting the students together with 
their instructors that many teachers did little beyond promising their students 
that next class would be better. But some students seemed to take the problems 
in relatively good humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a comical situation," Scott Mason Jr. said, laughing. Mason, a 
34-year-old business major, arrived for his 7 a.m. finance class to find that 
his modular classroom had no desks, no chairs and no electrical power or heat. 
There were no stairs to the door three feet off the ground, forcing students to 
climb in, nor any sign marking the building's number. 
</P>
<P>
 Other students were not so lighthearted. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Taub, 20, of North Hills arrived an hour before his 9 a.m. class to 
begin hunting for classroom 1326. Following a map, he wandered in one 
direction, then in another, looking among the maze of portable buildings set up 
in athletic fields and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 After asking directions twice, he finally arrived, out of breath and just in 
time to answer "here!" when his name was called. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is . . . hell!" another lost student shouted. While the students and 
teachers wandered amid the clusters of buildings, workmen continued assembling 
electrical wiring to the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the anxiety was a 3.3-magnitude aftershock, which rolled through the 
campus at 12:32 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Neumeyer, Taub's teacher, shouted over the roar of a generator that 
she would be teaching concepts for the first three weeks because no writing 
could be done. "Welcome to a new adventure," she said. "This is the computer 
center, but we don't have computers. We don't know when we will get computers, 
or if we will get computers at all this semester." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Ho, a 22-year-old business major, waited three hours for his 7 a.m. class. 
Finally, at 10 a.m., a man in a hard hat kicked him out of the trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got up at 6 a.m. to get here and stood around for three hours. They should 
have waited until they set up everything before they tell us to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 One much-anticipated problem -- that traffic and parking would be a nightmare 
because of the collapse of the largest parking structure on campus -- failed to 
materialize, partly because surrounding neighborhoods usually closed to parking 
were opened up. Some people had to wait as long as 30 minutes for a spot, but a 
shuttle system set up by the university appeared to work well in bringing 
students to campus from outlying areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Once at CSUN, attendants at 22 information booths told the students where to 
go on the 353-acre campus. More than 24,500 students, about 1,500 fewer than 
last spring, signed up for classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The classroom situation turned out to be much worse than anticipated. As late 
as Sunday, university officials were assuring people that all the portables 
would be in place when Monday morning arrived. But more continued arriving 
during the morning. And many of those that were already on campus were not 
ready for occupancy. Officials estimated that 120 classrooms, about a third of 
the total, were out of service Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson conceded that Monday's session was "joyful chaos," but did not regret 
pushing the deadline. If it had not been for the rain and then the high winds 
in recent weeks, all the portables would have been in place, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, two of the portables burned down Sunday morning. Rolando Canche, 
19, discovered this fact when he went looking for his Chicano Studies class and 
instead found his professor, Alberto Garcia, holding the class in an open 
field. The cause of fire is considered suspicious, said acting campus police 
chief Mark Hissong. 
</P>
<P>
 Hissong said the university has hired 10 private security guards to help the 
nine campus police officers protect the portable classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the general disarray Monday, the university's chief spokesman, Bruce 
Erickson, said jokingly, "Problems? What problems? It looks like the typical 
first day after an earthquake to me." Then, Erickson added, "It could have been 
much more chaotic than it is. It was a gamble. It was not a foregone conclusion 
that we were going to be able to open." 
</P>
<P>
 To cope with the chaos, many students did what Angelenos have learned to do 
more and more since the quake hit -- they improvised. Alison LaPietro, a 
21-year-old senior music major, couldn't find her class, so she wrote its name 
on a piece of cardboard and waved it at passersby. "It's no one's fault. I'm 
pretty amazed they're even open today. They're doing their best," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dust from construction work blew into the faces of students waiting more than 
two hours in line at the Student Union, which had been converted into the 
university's temporary administration offices, for their financial aid checks. 
The checks were retrieved from the administration building, where more than $8 
million in financial aid had been trapped since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at the Cal State Northridge Ventura Campus, college officials are 
expecting student numbers to swell because of the high volume of calls they 
received from main campus students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had numerous calls from students from the San Fernando Valley and Thousand 
Oaks areas just after the earthquake asking if classes were available," said 
Joyce M. Kennedy, the director of the Ventura campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to be able to overenroll in a few classes to accommodate the people 
who have been disrupted by the earthquake," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 110 classes offered at the Ventura campus, 40 are already full and 15 
are nearly full, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan to re-create CSUN was kicked off Jan. 27, when Wilson gave the 
go-ahead to bring in hundreds of portable buildings from as far away as 
Northern California and Nevada. Construction teams worked around the clock 
anchoring the buildings in place, and Gov. Pete Wilson waived state regulations 
so that the extra-wide portable buildings could be hauled at night to make the 
Valentine's Day reopening deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, however, felt that the deadline should have been extended. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sharon Eisenberg, a 20-year-old junior communications studies major, 
began her search for her 8 a.m. psychology class, she was in good spirits. But 
that mood wore away, along with the soles of her shoes. "Boy, I'm really late 
for my class and I might be dropped. I'm really nervous," she groused to one of 
the campus' guides, who was unable to help her. 
</P>
<P>
 That was enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "This school is insane. You can quote me on that. I should have transferred to 
San Diego State when I had a chance."

WASHINGTON'S FISH-GOBBLING SEA LIONS MAY BE SENT SOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As many as 60 California sea lions that are devouring large numbers of 
steelhead trout off Washington state would be relocated to waters off Ventura 
and Santa Barbara counties under a proposal to be considered this week by the 
California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which has been criticized by local fishing interests, marks the 
second time that the National Marine Fisheries Service has tried to relocate 
sea lions to keep them from eating the already depressed stocks of steelhead at 
their spawning grounds near Ballard Locks, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, after the fisheries service relocated six sea lions to Southern 
California waters, five returned to Ballard -- a 1,500-mile journey -- within a 
month, according to James R. Raives, a Coastal Commission analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently, as soon as they were released into the water, they headed north 
and high-tailed it back to Washington," Raives said, adding that sea lions in 
Washington all migrated north from California in the first place. "They 
apparently know a good meal when they see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Scordino, deputy chief of fisheries management for the fisheries service's 
Northwest division, said the goal is not necessarily to relocate the sea lions 
permanently, but to provide some relief for the spawning steelhead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, what we are doing is buying some time for the steelhead to spawn 
without them being grabbed by the sea lions," Scordino said. "We do not harbor 
any beliefs that the animals we transport down there will stay there." 
</P>
<P>
 Raives said the Coastal Commission staff will recommend that members approve 
the fisheries service proposal, but local fishing officials said it is a bad 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "The population of sea lions here is already out of control," said Brian 
Jenison, spokesman for the Ventura County Commercial Fishermen's Assn. "It's 
not right that one state's problems are being dumped on another." 
</P>
<P>
 Jenison said the sea mammals often follow sport and commercial fishing vessels 
and effectively shut down their operations, grabbing the catches directly from 
nets and lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the sea lions show up, you have to leave or you'll be wasting your 
time," Jenison said, adding that the sea lions especially enjoy sea bass and 
halibut. "You just hope that they won't follow you." 
</P>
<P>
 Scordino said the Ballard Locks area is the first hurdle of a miles-long 
steelhead migratory path into the Lake Washington watershed off Puget Sound. 
Because the fish are slow to negotiate the locks' fish ladders, they become 
vulnerable to the constantly hungry sea lions. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to protect the steelhead, fisheries service biologists have 
installed underwater devices that emit noise designed to repel the sea lions. 
This works to some extent, Scordino said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The animals that we will eventually seek to relocate are those that penetrate 
the acoustical barrier around the locks," Scordino said. "So far, that barrier 
has worked, but we would like to have the relocation option available to us 
should we need it." 
</P>
<P>
 After capturing the sea lions, officials would truck them south from 
Washington to the Santa Barbara area. The ride would take an estimated 
22-hours, with stops along the way to feed and wet down the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Scordino said the mammals would be released into groups of sea lions near the 
Channel Islands. In peak season, the Santa Barbara Channel is home to more than 
100,000 sea lions, according to official estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 If any of the newcomers remained in Southern California waters, the Coastal 
Commission's Raives said, they would be the larger, sexually mature animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we noticed in 1989 was that all five of the sea lions that returned to 
Washington were young or sub-adult in classification," Raives said. "The one 
animal that stayed in the area was older and bigger and was able to integrate 
himself with the local populations of female sea lions." 
</P>
<P>
 For Jan Mangus, 44, a Santa Barbara-based sport fishing enthusiast, the 
addition of even a few sea lions means more headaches and less fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I view sea lions the same way a farmer views gophers -- a real pest," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is scheduled to come before the Coastal Commission during its 
meeting at 9 a.m. Thursday in San Diego.

BROWN CALLS FOR BAN ON ADS THAT ATTACK; RESPONSE IS CRITICAL; POLITICS: SHE 
ASKS OPPONENTS TO SIGN PLEDGE. WILSON'S CAMP CALLS HER A HEADLINE-HUNGRY 
HYPOCRITE. 'DESPERATE GIMMICK,' SAYS GARAMENDI.

 Calling for elected leaders to "change the way they do business," state 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown on Monday challenged Gov. Pete Wilson and Insurance 
Commissioner John Garamendi to promise -- in writing -- to conduct "positive" 
gubernatorial campaigns and refrain from initiating so-called attack 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 The call for clean campaigning triggered a round of barbed critiques and 
backhanded counterproposals that did not bode well for the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown asked Wilson and Garamendi to join her in signing the one-page treaty, 
titled the "honest and clean campaign pledge," that she said would assure 
California voters that "all the candidates for governor are telling the truth." 
She also called for the creation of a special commission to enforce the pledge, 
which Brown will promote in a 30-second television ad beginning today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I agree to run a different kind of campaign," Brown says in her ad. "No 
negative ads bashing your opponent, but instead an election about the issues. 
So John, Pete -- let's all sign on." 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Wilson's campaign painted Brown as a headline-hungry hypocrite. 
"She's been trashing the living daylights out of us for six months and now she 
wants a positive campaign?" asked spokesman Dan Schnur, who swiftly issued a 
compendium of barbs that Brown has flung at the Republican incumbent in recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, meanwhile, labeled Brown's proposal a "desperate gimmick" intended 
to try to limit the scope of debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a fact that you say you oppose the death penalty, say you will enforce 
the death penalty, but refuse to say whether you would sign legislation 
expanding the death penalty," Garamendi wrote in a letter faxed Monday to 
Brown. "It is a fact that you have taken over $1 million in contributions from 
the investment banking industry that receives huge contracts from the 
treasurer's office. . . . I trust the voters of this state to make up their own 
minds." 
</P>
<P>
 Conspicuously missing from both Brown's ad and her pledge was any mention of 
state Sen. Tom Hayden, who last week entered the June 7 Democratic primary 
race. Brown's campaign explained that the ad was produced before Hayden's 
announcement. In a letter delivered Monday to Hayden, Brown said she would ask 
him to sign the pledge as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden, who said he would not "speak ill of my opponents," late Monday 
chastised Brown for making a 30-second ad whose 81-word message was in a format 
that Hayden said failed to "transmit any meaningful information." Hayden issued 
his own "honest and clean campaign pledge addendum" calling upon candidates not 
to air 30-second ads. 
</P>
<P>
 The call for clean campaigning has become a staple of modern political races, 
but the high ideals often seem to falter in the heat of campaigning, when one 
candidate's aboveboard salvo becomes another's scurrilous attack. "The 
question," said pollster Mervin Field, "is just how do you define negative?" 
</P>
<P>
 There was immediate confusion Monday about how, exactly, Brown was defining 
it. Bill Press, chairman of the state Democratic party, said he interpreted 
"no-negative" to mean a ban on personal attacks -- a proposal he heartily 
endorsed. Ads that pick apart a candidate's public record, however, should 
still be fair game, Press said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Speaking for the party, I think it's very fair and important and honest to 
contrast Pete Wilson's rhetoric with Pete Wilson's record, as we have done and 
will continue to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Michael Reese, spokesman for Brown's campaign, indicated that Brown 
intended her proposals to have a much broader sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 "A negative ad would be defined as any ad that criticizes explicitly or 
implicitly another candidate, named or unnamed," Reese said. "Attacking Pete 
Wilson for doing fund raising with the heads of regulatory agencies in his 
Administration, unfortunately for us, is a negative ad. Saying the economy is 
in trouble would not be." 
</P>
<P>
 Recent polls have shown the 48-year-old Brown to be the front-runner by a 
narrow margin, and to some observers Monday's stay-positive proposal seemed 
designed to shield her from attacks that might nibble away at that lead. Field, 
a longtime analyst of California politics, predicted that Brown's vow to stay 
on the political high road would please some voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is some benefit to being the first candidate to come out and say 
something like that," Field said, although he added that "in this day and age, 
it's almost impossible for campaigns not to get negative. . . . It's almost 
like the Muslims and the Serbs having a truce. It just can't be maintained." 
</P>
<P>
 Some political analysts, however, said that the "no-negative" proposal could 
backfire for Brown, who is fending off criticism that her likable image could 
be a liability in an intense gubernatorial race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Democracy is all about thrust and parry, back and forth and controversy and 
attacks and counter attacks," said Ken Khachigian, a Republican political 
consultant who dismissed Brown's proposal as "semi-whiny." 
</P>
<P>
 "This points up one of her weaknesses: Does she have the stature and the 
strength and the muscle and the conviction and the thick skin to be governor of 
the state of California?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Darry Sragow, Garamendi's campaign manager, hit on the same theme. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is typical of what we've come to expect from Kathleen," he said. "She's 
a very nice person who comes from a family that has included two governors. But 
she tends to think in very simplistic terms." 
</P>
<P>
 Reese, Brown's spokesman, rejected the suggestion that Brown was attempting to 
dodge criticism and said that her call for responsible conduct should be viewed 
as a daring move. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easier to sling mud," he said. "The challenge here is to stay with the 
issues and be positive. That's not 'nice.' . . . That's meeting a demonstrated 
need. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson campaign director George Gorton said the governor might be willing to 
negotiate a code of campaign conduct if Brown first responds to 10 detailed 
questions about state issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorton sent letters Monday to Brown, Garamendi and Hayden demanding answers to 
queries about education funding, cuts in health and welfare, taxes and other 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorton said he did not expect that Brown or the other candidates would answer 
the questions. Instead, he said, the Wilson campaign was trying to make a 
point: that the governor has been making difficult decisions for more than 
three years and his opponents should not be allowed to get away with talking in 
generalities. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we would like to do," Gorton said, "is focus the campaign on the 
issues."

BONE DISCOVERY MAY DELAY BOLSA CHICA DEVELOPMENT; ARCHEOLOGY: NATIVE AMERICAN 
LEADERS SAY HUNTINGTON BEACH SITE COULD INCLUDE AN ANCIENT BURIAL GROUND. 
STUDIES WILL DETERMINE IF REMAINS ARE ANIMAL OR HUMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A study commissioned by the Orange County coroner's office has confirmed that 
there are more than 20 concentrations of bones in the path of a major housing 
development proposed near the Bolsa Chica wetlands in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be months before officials determine whether the bones are human or 
animal. One set of human bones believed to be about 8,000 years old was found 
at the site in 1992. And word of the latest discovery has lent credence to the 
arguments of Native American leaders, who believe the 7.4-acre parcel may have 
been an ancient burial site. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's a dedicated cemetery, that's it," said Jim Velasques, chief of the 
coastal Gabrieleno Shoshone tribe. "It's sacred. You cannot dig up bones if you 
have six or more burials without the consent of the descendants." 
</P>
<P>
 However, officials with the Koll Real Estate Group, which is planning the 
project, said the latest finding would not affect the 4,286-home development 
proposed for 400 acres near the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that the site is of great importance to the ancient 
history of Orange County," said Lucy Dunn, a senior vice president. "But we've 
designed the most sensitive plan that can possibly be designed. . . . It's not 
likely that a redesign will be necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's office confirmed information contained in a map detailing at 
least 20 sites where bone matter has been found. The map was prepared for Koll 
by Nancy Whitney-Desautels, an archeologist excavating the site. 
</P>
<P>
 While state law does not expressly forbid the destruction of Native American 
cemeteries, experts say, public pressure could persuade county officials to 
require the developer to make major modifications in the project in order to 
preserve the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue arose last month when opponents of the project began circulating a 
memo written by a forensic anthropologist hired by the Orange County coroner's 
office to examine the bones found in 1992. In the memo, Judy Myers Suchey, a 
faculty member at Cal State Fullerton, described the handful of human bones she 
had seen as "very old, approximately 8,000 years," and therefore of serious 
interest to archeologists. 
</P>
<P>
 Angered that no mention of the find had been made in the county's draft 
environmental impact report released last year, project opponents gathered 
during a city hearing on the matter that attracted 600 residents. Over the 
weekend, a group of Native Americans staged a protest on the steps of City 
Hall, contending that they had been left in the dark regarding the disposition 
of their ancestors' remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Copies of the map, which had not previously been made public, were circulated 
at the demonstration. Prepared last August, the map indicates locations 
described as "known bone concentrations." 
</P>
<P>
 What is not clear, Whitney-Desautels said Monday, is how many of the bones are 
animal and how many human. She did not rule out the possibility that the area 
was a Native American cemetery. She described it as "a difficult case" because 
the human remains discovered so far are tiny and intermingled with animal 
bones. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the coroner's office said that about 50% of bones reported to 
the sheriff turn out to be those of animals. According to Whitney-Desautels, 
two of the bone concentrations at Bolsa Chica have already been determined to 
be those of deer and dolphin. The rest are being examined in laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should know in about three months," she said. "At this point it's 
impossible to say how many (human) individuals are there." 
</P>
<P>
 The findings seemed to have clear implications for Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the bones of our great ancestors," said Martin Alcala, chairman of 
the Gabrieleno-Tongva Tribal Council. "They are culturally and spiritually 
significant to us. It would be the same as if we went into your graveyards and 
started digging up your ancestors."

BOON TO CROPS GOES BUST -- SOMETIMES; AGRICULTURE: MANY GROWERS ARE UNABLE TO 
DUPLICATE THE IMPRESSIVE RESULTS OF AN EXPERIMENT USING METHANOL. BUT A FEW 
SUCCEED, CREATING A PUZZLE FOR SCIENTISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A dramatic discovery that promised to revolutionize agriculture in the hot, 
arid regions of the Earth is being tested in an extraordinary public crucible 
spanning several continents. But the results have left scientists and farmers 
baffled over why the seemingly simple process has failed to work for most 
researchers, but seems to work so easily for others. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a mystery replete with 40-pound watermelons on one hand and 
disappointing cotton crops on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to replicate the experiments of Arizona botanist-turned-farmer Arthur 
Nonomura spread rapidly around the world after he announced in late 1992 that 
spraying his plants with an inexpensive solution of methanol during unusually 
hot periods increased their growth rate by as much as 100% while reducing the 
need for water. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery, revealed in a research paper published in the prestigious 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, electrified researchers who 
saw it as a possible breakthrough in introducing agriculture to dry areas of 
the planet where starvation is rampant. 
</P>
<P>
 Methanol is readily available in its most common form -- wood alcohol -- so 
anyone with a few acres of land could try their luck with the process -- -- and 
many have. Although some experts have claimed "astonishing" success, other 
researchers insist that methanol did nothing for their crops. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Nonomura and his partner, plant growth expert Andrew Benson of 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, are left twisting slowly in 
the wind, wondering if their reputations will go the way of cold fusion 
advocates or if they have begun the long march toward a Nobel Prize. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have heard comparisons with cold fusion," one scientist said, referring to 
claims by two Utah scientists a few years ago that they had achieved fusion in 
a test tube. But unlike the Utah duo, Nonomura and Benson have published their 
work in professional journals and have cooperated fully with other researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonomura insists he is not surprised by the mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the first year of testing," he said recently. "My gosh, what are we 
talking about? All of this information is preliminary. We can't say anything 
conclusive." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the two scientists were stunned late last year when the Department of 
Agriculture issued a press release suggesting that methanol "either doesn't 
help, or helps only under very limited conditions." The statement came on the 
heels of trials involving 14 crops in 14 states, including Arizona, where the 
technology was expected to work the best. None of the scientists in the 
department's Agricultural Research Service, which carried out the tests, saw 
significant improvement in the crops. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis Nakayama of the department's Phoenix office said methanol was applied 
in a series of experiments in the Arizona desert last summer, and "we did not 
see any improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 That would seem to bury the issue, but other researchers around the world 
reported great success with the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done it, and it's awesome," said Robert M. Devlin, a plant physiologist 
at the University of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 Devlin said he experimented with wheat, oats and peas and saw dramatic 
improvement in all three. He said just for fun he also tried it on his bachelor 
buttons, small blue flowers, and "you wouldn't believe the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 The flowers, he said, were 2 1/2 times as big as those on untreated plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Other scientists in Wyoming, Maryland and several countries also have reported 
positive results. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to that a couple of no-nonsense farmers near Phoenix who claim spectacular 
improvement in treated crops and you have a scientific mystery of Olympian 
proportions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It worked for me," said Santiago Gonzalez, who runs a large farm west of 
Phoenix. Gonzalez said treatments of methanol last summer allowed him to grow 
seedless watermelons that weighed 40 pounds compared to an average of 18. He 
said cotton plants treated with methanol used so much less water that he saved 
about $50 an acre on one 600-acre parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 Another farmer, Arnott Duncan, said his vegetables showed dramatic improvement 
when treated with methanol. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see a great potential for methanol," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other farmers reported similar results. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jack Mauney, a senior plant physiologist who has seen a lot of highly 
promising "breakthroughs" come and go, said: "I'm not buying it." 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran scientist was hired by several cotton growers to conduct 
experiments last summer on three cotton fields in Arizona and one in 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was going to be easy," Mauney said, because the process seemed 
so simple and the effect was supposed to be so great. But because nothing in 
agricultural research works all the time, he said he would have been satisfied 
if his crops showed improvement in 40% of the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead, he said recently, he was skunked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Essentially, I saw no effect at all," Mauney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of results was so disappointing that "most cotton people were ready 
to hang it up" at the end of the last season, he said, but he hopes to do more 
tests next year. Mauney is not ready to abandon the effort because he believes 
methanol may indeed stimulate plant growth, but not for the reasons that 
Nonomura expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonomura began spraying his crops with methanol in 1989 because of research he 
had done at Scripps, finding that it increased the growth of a type of algae 
that he believed could be used as a substitute for gasoline. When he abandoned 
research to become a family farmer in Arizona, he noticed that some of his 
crops wilted during times of high heat stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Remembering his work with algae, Nonomura sprayed some of his plants with a 
solution containing methanol and they straightened up, grew faster and took 
less water. Nonomura believed then, as he still does, that the methanol 
supplied the stressed plants with additional carbon that inhibited a process 
called photorespiration, during which plants reject some of the energy they 
have collected. 
</P>
<P>
 With that as the suspected mechanism, most experiments were conducted last 
summer using solutions containing 30% methanol, but some nutrients Nonomura 
included in his solution were omitted because they were believed to be 
irrelevant. Mauney, for one, believes that may have been a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Mauney said that "if methanol works at all," it may be because it causes the 
plant to absorb nutrients through its leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson, Nonomura's collaborator, believes Mauney could be right. 
</P>
<P>
 Plant leaves do not absorb nutrients easily because they are sealed with a 
wax-like substance, Benson said. Methanol may "soften them up," allowing 
nutrients to "slither through cracks" in the coating. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the mechanism, Benson and Nonomura remain convinced that methanol 
plays a major role in stimulating plant growth, despite the lack of encouraging 
results from so many researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty dramatic," Benson said. Once plants are treated with methanol, 
"they just perk up and get to work." 
</P>
<P>
 If so, then something is different about the way some researchers are applying 
it. If it is as Mauney suspects, then methanol could be an important carrier of 
nutrients that allows plants to take up fuel more efficiently.

FORGING NEW BEGINNINGS; NEIGHBORHOODS: THE EMOTIONAL DISTANCE THAT ONCE 
SEPARATED RESIDENTS OF A LAGUNA BEACH STREET WAS BURNED AWAY BY OCTOBER'S 
FIRESTORM. NOW, FOR THE FIRST TIME, THERE IS A FEELING OF COMMUNITY AND 
FRIENDLINESS.

 During 22 years of living in the peaceful hills above this city's downtown, 
Christian Werner had never learned the name of a single neighbor on Buena Vista 
Way, a quiet, winding street lined with hedges and high walls that provided the 
privacy he cherished. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, says Werner, a geography professor at UC Irvine, his rare, chance 
exchanges with neighbors seldom varied from the ritual: They would greet each 
other, concur yet again on the beauty of the day, then slip back inside their 
hillside havens. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Oct. 27 firestorm destroyed the wooden fences and leafy curtains 
that divided these neighbors, social barriers tumbled as well. The emotional 
distance that many on Buena Vista had carefully preserved for years is now 
shattered, no less a casualty of the fire than the nine houses that burned 
along this narrow, one-block street. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the relationships have changed," said Loretta Edger, 53, who has owned 
a house at 661 Buena Vista for 18 years and visited frequently from her main 
residence in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all much more open now, much more willing to talk and be helpful to 
each other," she said. "There's a feeling that we're all in this together, a 
feeling for the first time of real community." 
</P>
<P>
 Werner, 58, agrees, although at times he wistfully remembers the seclusion he 
enjoyed behind his jungle of exotic greenery at 657 Buena Vista, next door to 
Edger. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a remarkable experience," Werner said soon after the blaze, as he 
fielded phone calls from fellow fire victims he barely knew. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kinds of events tend to establish a commonality among neighbors. I have 
only seen or talked to these people very casually in the past, but they are 
reaching out to me now, and they are proving to be very nice, compassionate and 
open." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly four months after the fire raced down Buena Vista and other nearby 
roads -- incinerating homes, upsetting routines and scarring lives -- the 
neighborhood here is reviving as its residents' relationships grow. Although 
foundations for homes will not be laid for several months, signs of the 
street's regeneration abound. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge, blackened cork oak that stands before Don and Jo Williamsons' 
burned-out lot at 665 Buena Vista has burst into verdant bloom. Bright green 
asparagus ferns have struggled up through the ashes and a scorched Indian 
hawthorne is covered with tiny pink blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the northern end of the street, an architect's sign sprouts from the yard 
of what used to be Sheila Patterson and Shannon Nally's home at 644 Buena 
Vista; down the way, a surveyor's orange flags mark the boundaries of the 
Williamsons' lot -- both preludes to the homes to come. 
</P>
<P>
 In much the same way, friendships between neighbors on Buena Vista have also 
blossomed, ensuring that life here will never return to the way it was. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has changed so dramatically, it can't be the same," said Jackie Allen, who 
says she is looking forward to the more neighborly incarnation of her street. 
"All of us were pretty much into our own lives before, but it'll be a different 
story now." 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Vista Way had never been the sort of street where residents borrowed 
sugar from each other, sweated together over back-yard projects or entertained 
back and forth, several said. Most on the street are busy professionals whose 
limited time for socializing centered more on their offices or long-term 
friendships than on their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 But within hours of the fire, the new bonds were forged, as family after 
family returned to the charred northern end of the street to discover their 
homes in ashes. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, flyers blanketed the block, at first from residents offering 
support to those whose homes had burned, later advertising one fire-related 
gathering after another: a joint thank you presentation for firefighters from 
the lucky ones whose homes still stood; a "we survived the fire" celebration 
for anyone around that first weekend; a three-street block party to honor a man 
credited with saving several dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, residents who had waved casually to each other for years found 
themselves exchanging hugs, often with their names and new phone numbers. Since 
then, they have seen one another in visits to the devastated street and at the 
many meetings here aimed at helping fire victims find their way through the 
maze of insurance claim forms and rebuilding regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who cannot make the meetings are often kept informed by their neighbors. 
Werner, the next-door neighbor Loretta Edger barely knew before the fire, now 
calls her frequently at her home in Illinois and sends her handouts from the 
meetings he attends, Edger said. 
</P>
<P>
 The genteel, almost formal, distance between many here once kept them from 
teasing each other, even gently, about the appearances of their homes or 
gardens. But those barriers, too, have fallen. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for example, a eucalyptus tree that had stood in Werner's jungle-like 
garden and blocked a corner of George Cary's view. 
</P>
<P>
 One day after the fire, Cary and Werner stood together on the street, looking 
out toward the Pacific over their blackened lots, the charred skeletons of 
trees poking up through the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half seriously, half joking, I told him I really hoped that particular tree 
didn't come back," said Cary, who lived at 645 Buena Vista with his wife, 
Marlene Wright, and their infant daughter. "I would never have said that 
before; we didn't even know him." 
</P>
<P>
 As the friendships evolve, residents say they are sharing more than their 
mutual frustrations with the tedious rebuilding process. According to several, 
they are also volunteering specifics of their personal finances, including the 
extent of their insurance coverage and the values of their old homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Werner and Edger have compared notes on the widely divergent ways their two 
insurance companies are determining the values of their old homes. Werner's has 
required that two architects re-create the plans, at a cost of about $3,000 per 
set, while Edger's has assessed her home based on an appraisal of the lot, a 
survey of comparable properties and her description of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Several others, including Sheila Patterson, her next-door neighbor, Tom Homan, 
and Jackie and Jim Allen are sharing information about the amounts their 
insurers are willing to pay architects to draw the plans for the new houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to help each other get through all the bureaucratic 
insanity," Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire survivors said they have begun discussing ways to cooperate as they 
rebuild, efforts that extend far beyond the usual conversations between 
neighbors in Laguna Beach about promising not to obstruct each other's views. 
</P>
<P>
 As they plan their new houses, many on the street are considering hiring a 
single geological firm to reduce the cost of studying their lots -- hoping that 
a comprehensive, joint survey might enhance their knowledge of their land, 
including any risk associated with rebuilding on a slope that has slid at least 
once. 
</P>
<P>
 The city requires such studies before it will issue building permits and 
several Buena Vista owners believe that the current situation provides an 
opportunity to study the entire area for potential problems that might affect 
them all. 
</P>
<P>
 Several on the street, including Werner, also regularly attend meetings of the 
well-organized homeowners association in nearby Mystic Hills, and have returned 
to their neighbors with borrowed ideas for even greater cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Werner said he is interested in exploring whether the group should hire the 
same landscaper, jointly purchase building materials, or try to cooperate in 
scheduling the arrival of construction vehicles along the narrow street. But he 
expects that many of those ideas will not work. 
</P>
<P>
 Cary, a lawyer who has tried to organize the cooperative effort by arranging 
meetings and acting as an information clearinghouse for his neighbors, agreed. 
Cary said the only viable plan involves the geological survey. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just takes a huge amount of time and effort to get everyone together, to 
get the word out, even to make the phone calls," Cary said. "We're still trying 
to do it with the geological (study) but that may end up being the only thing 
we do together." 
</P>
<P>
 The various households, subject to the schedules of their insurance adjusters, 
architects and others, find themselves at widely different stages of the 
rebuilding process. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents have just begun to compile the comprehensive lists of 
belongings required by their insurance companies. Others have completed their 
lists and received settlement checks. A few are working with architects to plan 
the specifics of their new homes, while others have yet to choose an architect. 
</P>
<P>
 Each stage of the process holds the potential to widen the gaps. 
</P>
<P>
 One family has decided to move forward on its own with plans for rebuilding, 
convinced that any group effort on the required studies will take too long. 
</P>
<P>
 For 37 years, the Williamsons had lived in a soaring A-frame designed by Don 
Williamson, an architect and the former director of Laguna Beach's Pageant of 
the Masters. Now 80, he is designing the couple's new home and said he and his 
wife, Jo, 78, have decided to proceed in order to maximize the time they can 
spend in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could just see this going on forever," he said, referring to the 
discussions over the geological study and a recent decision by the group to 
seek a second bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Allen, lamenting the loss of her home of 18 years at 631 Buena Vista, 
has experienced a similar frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "This just takes so long, every step of the way," she said. "My main thing is 
just to get back into that house and try to get back to normal." 
</P>
<P>
 And when she does, she said, she will throw a party for her neighbors, a 
celebration of survival, renewal and newfound friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "When all is said and done, it will be a nicer neighborhood," she said. "We 
will all be better friends because of what we've been through."

CONGRESSMAN MEETS MYANMAR DISSIDENT; ASIA: DEMOCRAT BECOMES THE FIRST 
NON-FAMILY MEMBER TO VISIT NOBEL LAUREATE SINCE HER '89 HOUSE ARREST.

<P>
 A U.S. congressman met with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Monday in 
the first non-family visit allowed the Nobel Peace Prize winner in her nearly 
five years of house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N.M.) also engaged in shuttle diplomacy with the 
ruling military junta to press for her release. But there was no sign of any 
change in the government's position that it will free her only if she agrees to 
leave Myanmar and live in exile abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will not leave the country," the 1991 winner of the Peace Prize reportedly 
told Richardson at her home in the capital, where she has been detained without 
charge or trial since July, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concept of driving somebody out of their own country is totally 
unacceptable to me," she told a New York Times reporter who accompanied 
Richardson, according to today's editions of the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper said she was in good spirits and apparently good health, but 
noted that she had sold much of the house's furniture to buy food. 
</P>
<P>
 She also was quoted as saying she had never been allowed to leave the compound 
of her home during her years in detention. 
</P>
<P>
 Suu Kyi also told the newspaper that she is willing to negotiate other matters 
with the military, other than her leaving the country. But the military has 
"made no moves to have a dialogue of any kind except on the terms under which I 
would leave Burma," she said. Burma is Myanmar's former name. 
</P>
<P>
 Suu Kyi, the daughter of assassinated independence leader Aung San, said she 
is determined to continue the struggle for democracy in Myanmar, an informed 
source reported. She expressed interest in discussions with the junta but said 
she already had been informed that her detention has been extended at least 
until January, 1995. She appeared to be in good health, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson delivered a letter to her from President Clinton, who has called 
publicly for her release. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the junta and Suu Kyi sought to benefit from the meeting, which took 
place a week before the U.N. Human Rights Commission is expected to take up the 
issue of Myanmar's human rights record, described by international monitoring 
groups as one of the world's worst. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the State Department's annual human rights report earlier this 
month, at least 500 people remain in prison for political reasons despite a 
clemency program begun in April, 1992. The junta, which has been trying to 
improve its image, says more than 2,000 political prisoners have been released. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's meeting occurred amid a debate within the U.S. government over the 
sometimes competing interests of upholding human rights and suppressing drug 
trafficking in Myanmar. The country is the world's largest source of illicit 
opium and heroin.

 More than 500 people have been killed in ethnic fighting that has spread 
across northern Ghana, military sources said.Thousands have been made homeless 
in the violence, which erupted Feb. 3, the sources added. One military source 
said the fighting between ethnic Kokombas and Nanumbas has spread to seven 
districts and engulfed other tribes. The Kokombas, settlers from Togo, have a 
history of clashes with the land-owning Nanumbas. They are now demanding 
paramount chief status, which would entitle them to own land as well. The other 
tribes' refusal to give in to their demands has been the main reason for 
conflict.

EPA FINDS WEIGHING BENEFITS, COSTS IS A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the chief regulator and enforcer of the nation's environmental standards, 
the Environmental Protection Agency has silenced many opponents of its rulings 
with a powerful and sophisticated weapon known as the cost-benefit analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 The tool enables scientists and econometrists to tote up the risks to the 
population of a given social ill -- an unregulated pollutant, for instance -- 
and compare it to the costs -- economic and social -- of measures that would 
correct that ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the agency's critics have taken up the same weapon. And they are getting 
some help from members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Clinton Administration was forced to shelve, at least 
temporarily, a plan to elevate the EPA to Cabinet-level status when a majority 
of House lawmakers refused to vote on the question until the EPA agreed to 
conduct a cost-benefit analysis of each of its regulations and policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision -- in which 60 Democrats broke ranks and sided with 167 
Republicans in a key procedural vote -- effectively derailed one of the 
Administration's key environmental priorities and has put the White House on 
notice that all of its environmental initiatives could face similarly stiff 
opposition from a burgeoning coalition of critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said that they already operate under an order to 
conduct cost-benefit assessments on any regulation with an economic impact of 
$100,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 But a requirement to do the analyses in all cases would paralyze the EPA with 
red tape and increase the costs of controlling pollution, they argued. The 
EPA's number-crunchers estimated that the agency would have to spend $25 
million to $30 million more a year and add 50 employees to carry out the policy 
as Congress envisioned it. 
</P>
<P>
 According to many lawmakers who back the idea, however, a cost-benefit 
analysis of new EPA regulations would show that lots of those directives exact 
tremendous economic tolls and deliver insignificant benefits to the public's 
health and welfare. The result, they hope, would be fewer new federal 
environmental regulations and greater circumspection on the part of the 
government's environmental agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the EPA's 24-year history, the cost-benefit analysis has been one 
of the EPA's most effective tools. Through the 1970s, analysts from the newly 
minted agency had little difficulty showing Congress that the benefits of 
controlling toxic pollutants greatly outweighed the costs of not doing so. Many 
U.S. rivers were so polluted they were catching fire, toxic chemical dumps 
littered the landscape and highly dangerous pesticides like DDT were in wide 
use in American communities. 
</P>
<P>
 But with more of the obvious problems now addressed, the EPA has turned 
increasingly to more subtle ones in which the science of risk assessment is 
inadequate and the trade-offs between the costs and benefits of a policy are 
less clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "So what's happened is that people in industry and those inclined to want to 
deregulate have seized on these assessments as a way to trivialize or minimize 
the extent of a given problem," said Adam Finkel, a fellow at the Center for 
Risk Management of Resources for the Future, an environmental think tank based 
in Washington that specializes in economic analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 In other cases, said Finkel, critics of a regulatory initiative use the 
analyses as a delaying tactic, since they frequently can be used to show that 
other environmental hazards should have higher regulatory priority. 
</P>
<P>
 But proponents of the cost-benefit proposal defend it as common sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will force us to set some priorities about issues, particularly since we 
have limited money and because many of these programs fall on local governments 
to implement and they don't have the funds either," said Rep. Gary A. Condit 
(D-Ceres). "I don't think it stops us from having good environment law. It 
forces us to spend our money on the things that are highest risk. It's a 
business application, a common-sense approach."

SALVAGING THE FORTUNE SPENT ON THE COLLIDER; THE ASSETS FROM THE ABANDONED 
MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR PROJECT SIT ON A TEXAS PRAIRIE. THERE ARE SEVERAL OPTIONS, 
BUT THE LAWYERS' DECISION IS AWAITED.

 When Congress canceled funding for the $11-billion superconducting super 
collider last October, lawmakers called for the "orderly" shutdown of what 
would have been the largest scientific instrument ever built. Having decided 
what to do, Congress didn't say how to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 As Dr. Tom Bush, associate director of the laboratory near rural Waxahachie, 
Tex., says: "It's 35 miles out in a cow pasture. What happens to everything 
that's there?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bush doesn't mean the desks and chairs and office supplies. He's talking about 
a $27-million cryogenics facility, where helium is cooled to just above 
absolute zero. A half-built linear accelerator -- about $9 million from 
completion -- which helps generate a beam of charged protons traveling at 
nearly the speed of light. A precisely mined tunnel, 14.5 miles long and up to 
250 feet deep, part of a planned 54-mile underground ellipse. In all, assets 
valued at more than $100 million sit on the north Texas prairie outside of 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush wants to open the lab's superconducting facilities to private industry, 
which could develop new technologies without large additional capital 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 The state of Texas has other ideas. For starters, it wants a refund from the 
U.S. Department of Energy for the $440 million the state sank into the project 
before it was killed. Under the terms of a 1990 agreement, Texas was to get its 
money back if the collider were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount owed Texas is still under negotiation, says Jeff Sherwood, a 
spokesman for the Energy Department. Until talks conclude, the disposition of 
the research labs, the equipment in them and the thousands of acres of land 
acquired from private owners is at a standstill. Also unresolved is whether to 
convert the collider site and facilities for other uses or to simply dismantle 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't do anything until it becomes clear who owns the property," says Greg 
Haas, the Energy Department's chief scientist in Dallas. "Frankly, we're 
waiting on the lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
 The basic mission of the super collider was to discover nothing less than the 
nature of matter. A counter-rotating stream of protons traveling near the speed 
of light would be slung around the underground ellipse. As the protons 
collided, physicists hoped, particles that make up the smallest known subatomic 
particles would shake loose, giving a better understanding of the basic 
structure of matter. 
</P>
<P>
 With the project 20% complete, scientists are scrambling to salvage what was 
built or bought before its demise. Suggestions have ranged from leasing the 
cryogenics facility to researchers who need to super-chill materials to 
finishing the linear accelerator and three energy boosters to create a 
bargain-basement super collider. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hans Mark, former chancellor of the University of Texas system, says that 
the state should finish digging the tunnel, at a cost of about $200 million. 
"The scientific reasons for building the SSC are as good as when we originally 
set the thing up," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finishing the tunnel has to do with nailing down the Texas site. I've been 
around long enough to know that no decision is ever final, and I guarantee you 
that this thing is going to be revisited in a few years. If we do the right 
thing now, it will be built here as originally planned. Right now the 
prevailing opinion is 'pour concrete into the tunnel,' which is stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 The Energy Department is currently sifting through 67 unsolicited proposals, 
ranging from one paragraph suggestions to thick, detailed treatises. Texas Gov. 
Ann Richards appointed a nine-member panel in December to consider collider 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first priority is to make Texas whole in the money already invested," 
said panel member Cathy Bonner, former state commerce director. "This was a 
contract that was broken with the state of Texas." 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting earlier last month, the panel recommended that 100 scientists be 
retained for a year to evaluate the proposals. The Energy Department's Haas, 
who is not on the panel, thinks it will take at least that long to "put 
together the kind of substantive proposals that are needed and to develop 
funding sources." 
</P>
<P>
 Bush, the lab's associate director, wants to get the ball rolling now while 
some of the collider's staff remain on site. Half of the 2,200 workers were 
scheduled to be laid off this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't act soon, obviously the people will be gone, eventually the 
machinery will be taken out, put in warehouses or sold for scrap metal," he 
said.NUCLEAR PARTI

ZULU KING SEEKS INDEPENDENCE FROM S. AFRICA; POLITICS: UNEXPECTED DEMAND GOES 
FAR BEYOND PREVIOUS CALLS FOR REGIONAL AUTONOMY. BUT THERE IS LITTLE CHANCE 
GOVERNMENT OR ANC WOULD ALLOW IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move that creates a dangerous new crisis for this country's troubled 
transition to democracy, the king of the Zulus abruptly announced Monday that 
he intends to set up his own independent state so he can rule as a sovereign 
monarch of South Africa's largest ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
 During a three-hour meeting with President Frederik W. de Klerk in the eastern 
city of Durban, King Goodwill Zwelithini demanded that the government 
effectively restore the traditional Zulu kingdom and cede him exclusive control 
of the apartheid-created black homeland of Kwazulu and the entire eastern 
province of Natal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I demand that you give the Zulu nation the opportunity to become free once 
again and to choose their own destiny for themselves," the king said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Zulu nation, he told tens of thousands of cheering supporters at a 
jammed soccer stadium rally before the meeting, would exist "on its own with 
its own territorial basis and with its own government." 
</P>
<P>
 He insisted that the Zulu people have "an inalienable right to 
self-determination." 
</P>
<P>
 The king, a mercurial figure who commands respect among many of the estimated 
8 million Zulus, said he would not abide by the results of the country's first 
free elections in April and would not respect the recently negotiated interim 
constitution for a post-apartheid government. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would instead promulgate his own constitution to "establish a 
monarchy modeled after the best examples of democratic and pluralistic 
monarchies in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed territory, essentially the northeastern quadrant of South Africa, 
would include all the land conquered by British colonial forces from the Zulus 
in 1834. 
</P>
<P>
 Zwelithini's unexpected demand goes far beyond previous calls by Zulu leaders 
for regional autonomy and adds new pressures on the government and the African 
National Congress. The ANC's president, Nelson Mandela, is expected to become 
the country's first black president after the April 26-28 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 There is virtually no chance that the ANC or government would allow the Zulus 
to secede. But differences between Zulus and Xhosas, especially those in the 
ANC, have been a root cause of the spiral of political violence that has 
claimed more than 13,000 lives in the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the white minority government and the ANC oppose the creation of separate 
territories on the basis of race or ethnicity. Under apartheid, homelands were 
created to separate the races and deny South African citizenship to blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk appeared to downplay Zwelithini's demand, telling reporters after the 
meeting that he would formally respond to the king's "new position" Thursday 
after consulting with his Cabinet. He said the constitution could be amended, 
if necessary, to accommodate "special needs." 
</P>
<P>
 In Cape Town earlier in the day, De Klerk told editors and publishers from 21 
nations attending the annual convention of the International Press Institute 
that the government is prepared to continue negotiations with anyone opposing 
the democratic process. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we cannot accept is a return in any form to racial discrimination and 
minority ethnic domination, or ethnic domination of any nature," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a rally Sunday in Retreat, a mixed-race township outside Cape Town, Mandela 
also ruled out the dismemberment of the nation. "We are not going to give any 
part of South Africa to any single ethnic group, black or white," he told 
several thousand supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Niehaus, an ANC spokesman, dismissed the king's demand as unrealistic. 
"We don't believe there is any possibility that such a separate state could be 
created," he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Niehaus also said the king could be partially accommodated. The interim 
national constitution, he said, does not bar the formulation of a provincial 
charter that would allow a figurehead monarch. The new nation will have nine 
provinces, each with its own constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The king is the nephew of Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, who is chief 
minister of Kwazulu and heads the Inkatha Freedom Party. Buthelezi has drawn 
considerable flak from his own supporters for joining forces with militant 
right-wing Afrikaners who have demanded the right to create a separate white 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance of anti-ANC blacks and pro-apartheid whites has said it will 
boycott the elections, as well as supervisory government structures created to 
ease the transition to a black majority government, unless it wins greater 
regional autonomy and a change in the proposed balloting to allow for 
ticket-splitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations to draw the alliance into the process stalled last week, and 
neither Inkatha nor the rest of the alliance members registered for the 
elections before a deadline expired Saturday night. Nineteen other parties will 
contest the race, but both Mandela and De Klerk have said Parliament could be 
recalled into special session to allow additional parties to register. 
</P>
<P>
 At a rally Sunday in northern Natal, Buthelezi angrily repeated his refusal to 
participate, however, and warned of violence if the elections proceed as 
planned. He accused the ANC of "ethnic cleansing" against Zulus in 
violence-scarred townships near Johannesburg, and he warned that the ANC may 
"try to exterminate the Zulus as the Nazis tried to exterminate the Jews." 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi, a charismatic figure once considered the chief black rival to 
Mandela, has been largely eclipsed in recent months as Mandela and De Klerk 
have launched their election campaigns. Polls indicate Buthelezi's political 
support has fallen steadily and that his Inkatha party is unlikely to win more 
than a tiny fraction of votes if he joins the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview, Ziba Jiyane, spokesman and political director of 
Inkatha, said the king had issued his demand partly because he was upset that 
Buthelezi had not won any of his demands in months of negotiations with the 
government and ANC. 
</P>
<P>
 Jiyane warned that a confrontation now appears inevitable. "The king told his 
subjects that he'll be the first one ready to die. He said he won't beg Mandela 
for the land his forefathers fought for." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "It's terrifying, really. It makes things even worse, if they were 
not complicated enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Zwelithini first spoke to followers at King's Park Stadium. Many wore the 
traditional dress of animal skins and carried ceremonial spears, shields and 
machetes. Chanting and dancing, they later marched into downtown Durban, 
disrupting much of the bustling port city. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said one man was killed and another was wounded when gunshots were 
fired near City Hall, where the meeting with De Klerk was held. Both the king 
and Buthelezi later came outside to calm the crowd. No arrests were made.

FLEEING FIGHTING, THOUSANDS CROWD LIBERIAN PORT CITY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of refugees have fled fighting between two Liberian rebel groups and 
are now crammed into the port of Buchanan, relief workers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 6,000 and 7,000 people are squeezed into the port's two-story Louisa 
Hotel.Others have taken over homes abandoned earlier by residents who are now 
returning to find them occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecile Guillaume of the French agency Doctors Without Borders told reporters 
Sunday that many of those arriving were suffering from malaria, cholera and 
other diseases and that help was urgently needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebel leader Charles Taylor, whose National Patriotic Liberation Front was a 
major rebel force in the anarchic country, said Sunday that his men had been 
driven out of one town by a new armed group, the Liberia Peace Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor told Gbarnga Radio that his opponents had captured the town of Tapeta 
near the border with Ivory Coast and reached Sanoyie, farther east in Bong 
County via the port of Rivercess. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said a curfew was in force in Gbarnga and that frightened civilians 
were fleeing into the forest and to nearby towns.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; QUAKE DAMAGE AT CSUN CHILLS RETURNING 
STUDENTS; AFTERMATH: WRECKAGE AT THE OVIATT LIBRARY -- THE UNIVERSITY'S 
INTELLECTUAL AND PHYSICAL CENTER -- DRAWS STARES AMID OPENING DAY'S CONFUSION. 
</P>

<P>
 Students filed past the main library in chatty groups of twos and threes 
Monday, seemingly caught up in the complaints about classes and schedules heard 
on the first day of most semesters at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Then one by one, they looked -- some with just a glance, others staring, like 
drivers passing a car wreck. 
</P>
<P>
 The sight is irresistible. CSUN's Delmar T. Oviatt Library, the school's 
physical and intellectual center, looks like it got hit by a truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Even among college students, calloused as they might be by age, circumstance 
or television violence, the earthquake's damage has had a chilling effect. And 
nowhere in the city was the damage as concentrated as at CSUN, where students 
Monday finally saw the destruction firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cried when I got onto campus," said Mitzi Albert, a senior psychology 
major. "The pictures on TV can't really show the devastation that hit this 
campus. It's like an emotional aftershock." 
</P>
<P>
 The school's new logo, created last year, is based on the library's towering 
columns. "They chose the library for the logo because they wanted a symbol of 
strength and solidity," said Rabbi Jerry Goldstein, director of the school's 
Hillel Jewish student center. "It's ironic." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, pieces of the roof are missing, the columns have cracked and chain-link 
fencing keeps away all but the hard-hat workers trying to figure out how to 
salvage the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN officials, meanwhile, are crossing their fingers and hoping students will 
not be scared off by such sights, especially after a round-the-clock effort to 
begin the spring semester exactly four weeks after the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus officials spent Monday pointing to the extraordinary work done to 
reopen the school during talks with local politicians, as well as TV and radio 
crews. They wore T-shirts emblazoned with CSUN President Blenda J. Wilson's 
slogan for the rebuilding of the school: "Not Just Back . . . Better!" 
</P>
<P>
 Radio talk-show host Michael Jackson, broadcasting his telephone call-in show 
from the campus, declared the school's opening was the day's unrivaled national 
news story, "eclipsing even Tonya Harding." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as if to underscore the point, President Clinton called to give a best 
wishes-style greeting, which was heard by several hundred students who had 
gathered to listen. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan told the same crowd: "I see pride, I see hope, I see 
resilience." State Sen. David Roberti (D-Van Nuys) said he saw "great spirit, 
great rejuvenation." 
</P>
<P>
 Many students caught that spirit, unwilling to complain much about the long 
lines or the mislabeled classrooms or the prospect of having to perform lab 
work at UCLA or at Cal Lutheran in Thousand Oaks, some of the many 
inconveniences they face. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who have been put under the most trying of circumstances, such as 
history graduate student Richard Martindale, seemed willing to go along. 
</P>
<P>
 Martindale, who is blind, said the once-familiar campus layout has turned into 
strange territory, with walkways blocked and hundreds of temporary classrooms 
erected on formerly open fields. The sounds of construction -- trucks, 
generators and power tools -- have made it impossible to rely on familiar 
landmarks, such as the sound of a flapping flag or the hum of an air 
conditioner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Inside one of the new portable classrooms, chemistry teacher Frank Harris told 
a room packed with students, "As you can see, there are no blackboards. I also 
have no roster, so I don't know if you're supposed to be here or not. But 
congratulations on being here." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, like hundreds of other faculty, has been unable to retrieve anything 
from his office. So he must rely on notes that he kept at home, and a book from 
the campus bookstore, which is one of the few CSUN buildings operating 
normally. 
</P>
<P>
 Music teacher Joel Leach told his Introduction to Jazz class, meeting in one 
of five 70-foot-long tents erected on the campus, "I have an office. It's a 
Honda Accord and it's parked outside." 
</P>
<P>
 But amid the self-congratulation and good-humored improvisation, there is also 
a sense of unease about the school's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, there was an earthquake, but there were a lot of problems before," said 
Joe Lester, 24, a third-year health education major from Sherman Oaks. "No one 
took notice of this school until the buildings came down. Then Riordan shows up 
in a Northridge T-shirt. It's all politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Lester's comments, some of which were broadcast during Jackson's show, 
underscores much of the school's dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is no sense in worrying about all that now, said Kenyon S. Chan, 
chairman of CSUN's Asian-American Studies Dept. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of shock for people coming onto campus today," said Chan. 
"Going into my office for the first time was an emotional experience, seeing 
everything turned over and trashed. Students are going through the same thing. 
So we have to be upbeat. Otherwise, we'd just sit around and cry."

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; THE TRICK TO PARKING WAS MOSTLY LUCK; CSUN: 
WITH ABOUT 7,600 SPACES READY FOR OPENING DAY AND SHUTTLES RUNNING REGULARLY, 
MOST STUDENT DRIVERS ADMIT THEY HAD LITTLE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT.

 On Valentine Monday at Cal State Northridge, finding parking was about as 
fickle an affair as finding love. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Perez arrived late in the morning but was lucky enough to nab "the best 
parking space I've ever had." Mel Holmes tried getting to school early but 
wound up searching for half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 But patience or the luck of the draw paid off for most, and neighboring 
streets and designated parking areas witnessed none of the pandemonium that 
broke out on the campus itself on the first day of class after last month's 
devastating earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected utter chaos, but I was surprised," said Lori Lass, 30, an 
accounting student from Woodland Hills. "Things were running pretty smooth." 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow senior Cindy Levin, 22, agreed. "So you drive around for an extra five 
minutes and find a space when someone's pulling out. It's no different (from 
before). People are just being babies," she said with scorn for carping 
freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN officials had braced themselves for mass parking confusion and huge 
tie-ups after the collapse of a 2,500-space structure -- the university's 
largest -- in last month's temblor. Work crews scrambled to pave new lots in 
recent days, and about 7,600 spaces were ready for opening day, compared to 
9,200 before the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But traffic turned out to be a lesser headache Monday, despite the 
catch-as-catch-can flavor of the parking hunt during prime morning class hours. 
Although a few streets were busier than usual, cars flowed smoothly, motorists 
behaved civilly and free shuttles set up by the university hummed their way to 
and from the campus and outlying parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like the Disneyworld monorail," said Helen Rupp of Westchester, after 
hopping off a shuttle back to her car in the university's north parking lot. 
"It's fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
 At the abandoned Prairie Street School, a former elementary school on the main 
CSUN campus, university officials unlocked the gates early in the morning to 
provide 500 previously unused parking spaces. Attendants said the lot reached 
capacity by 9 a.m. -- as did lots on the west side of campus -- but the 
equilibrium was dynamic: Cars left throughout the morning, quickly replaced by 
others just arriving. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Perez was one of the fortunate. Although he pulled up at 10 a.m., a car 
had just exited, and the attendant waved him in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have problems parking every year. So I figured, what the hell, it can't be 
any worse than it was before," said Perez, 23, a history major from Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez has never put out the money for a campus parking permit and grew used to 
leaving his car on distant streets. "This is actually the best parking space 
I've ever had," he said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
 By arriving at CSUN later than most, he also missed the early-morning traffic 
on Nordhoff Street, which bogged down further with an accident at Gloria Avenue 
just west of the San Diego Freeway about 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, like Mel Holmes of Inglewood, weren't so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes, 19, sat through the congestion for several minutes, then cut over to 
side streets to get to campus. But after that came the half-hour ordeal of 
finding a parking space, with the slow, shark-like prowl ordinarily reserved 
for shopping mall lots at Christmastime. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally Holmes hit pay dirt -- but so did the city, which had a meter set up 
where she left her car. So the biology student sacrificed 25 cents for an 
hour's grace period. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all I had. But I have classes all day, so I can't worry about it now," 
she said. "Hopefully I won't get a ticket." 
</P>
<P>
 To deal with the influx of thousands of students for the new semester, city 
officials have eased parking restrictions on 25 neighboring streets. On 
sections of Etiwanda Avenue and Superior Street, for example, red "No Parking 
Anytime" signs have bowed to green tags advertising temporary parking. 
</P>
<P>
 The change does not go over well with some residents, a few of whom have 
fought for years to have their streets cleared of cars during the morning, if 
not all day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students use my circular driveway to turn around in. The car alarms drive me 
crazy. There's one that's gone off four times already today," said Gail 
Schepler, 33, as she took her two young children on a morning walk along 
Etiwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand the students have to have somewhere to park . . . (but) it's 
annoying," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "CSUN's problem is not mine," added Susan Lieberman, whose Superior Street 
driveway was hemmed on either side by a stretch of cars. "I don't think CSUN 
cares about the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Many students parked on side streets faced walks of up to a mile to the center 
of campus. Frank Moriarty of Simi Valley thought ahead -- and brought along the 
$200 pair of black in-line skates he purchased three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 After his 10 o'clock class, he strapped on the skates and glided back to his 
waiting Honda Accord. "They have a shuttle that'll take you, but I figure I can 
skate faster than that," Moriarty, 19, said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others decided to ride municipal buses or their own bicycles to campus, while 
a few car-pooled. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the shuttles did a brisk business with those who parked at the north 
end of campus along the old Devonshire Downs, where workers created 1,500 new 
spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like a yellow bus, so it's cool," said Puneh Iranpou, 20, a senior 
majoring in biology. "When they said shuttle, I thought, 'Back to high school.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually I'm really impressed. In a way it's really easier, because you don't 
have to find a place to park" closer to campus, she said.

VIACOM'S STRATEGY -- MERGING THE CONTENT WITH DISTRIBUTION; TECHNOLOGY: AN 
ACQUISITION OF PARAMOUNT WOULD PUT THE NEW GIANT IN ENVIABLE POSITION WITH 
'VERTICAL INTEGRATION.'

 In the early 1920s, legendary Paramount chief Adolph Zukor began buying movie 
theaters in a massive acquisition campaign that helped the studio to dominate 
the motion picture business for the next decade. Zukor, who had already built 
the industry's most formidable production machine, understood the value of 
combining content and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a century later, Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone -- who, like Zukor, 
started as a theater owner -- has pursued the same logic in the bitter fight he 
appeared to win Monday for the media conglomerate Paramount has become. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology rationale behind the Paramount-Viacom merger, which has been 
obfuscated throughout the long saga by slogans like "information superhighway" 
and "interactive multimedia universe" is that simple: "It's about companies 
that need content connecting with companies that have content," says one 
entertainment technology executive who has followed the merger closely. "It's 
called vertical integration." 
</P>
<P>
 That integration would, of course, take place against the backdrop of emerging 
new forms of entertainment and communication. And in an age where libraries of 
film and television shows are expected to be leveraged into zillions in profits 
by the rise of video-on-demand and interactive television, the newly combined 
company would be in an enviable position indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bishop Cheen, a senior analyst at Paul Kagan and Associates: "We have a 
field of dreams and now we have a field of Goliaths that are able to dream very 
large dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other Goliaths are Tele-Communications Inc. (which plans to merge 
with Bell Atlantic Corp.), Time Warner and News Corp., each of which brings 
different technological handicaps to the rapidly evolving entertainment and 
communications game. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese consumer electronics firms Sony and Matsushita, both of whom followed 
the Zukor strategy of consolidating content and distribution by buying U.S. 
entertainment firms in the 1980s, are in the midst of negotiating with cable 
and phone companies as it becomes apparent that the future of information and 
entertainment delivery will require wired and wireless networks outside the 
home as well as -- if not in lieu of -- videocassette recorders and compact 
disc players within. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI and Bell Atlantic probably have the most potential for synergy. Phone 
companies have huge networks of high-speed fiber-optic lines and expertise in 
two-way communications. Cable companies have broad-band lines which can carry 
masses of digital pictures, sound and data into homes, and they understand 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, TCI and Bell Atlantic would reach 40% of the nation's cable homes. 
But Time Warner, which last spring announced an alliance with U.S. West, is 
also working on matching its strengths with the phone company's in its Orlando, 
Fla., interactive television experiment. And Time Warner, like the new 
Paramount-Viacom combination, has an extensive programming library on its side 
of the balance sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 News Corp., pursuing Chairman Rupert Murdoch's belief in a "wireless world," 
is focusing on satellite broadcasting as an alternative form of distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 With Nynex Corp.'s $1.8-billion investment in Viacom's Paramount bid, the 
newly merged company would have a telephone component similar to TCI's and Time 
Warner's. 
</P>
<P>
 Nynex has one of the richest territories in terms of population density -- and 
as a result, some of the deepest pockets of all the Baby Bells. And 
Blockbuster's presence in the Viacom alliance adds an element of retail 
distribution that analysts say will be valuable, at least in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
 Which one of these media giants will dominate the shifting new landscape, or 
whether a new one will emerge, will become clearer as interactive television 
trials begin in different communities across the country later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Using "video servers," which can digitally store huge amounts of programming, 
and AT&T switching technology, Viacom's test bed in Castro Valley, Calif., will 
provide 1,000 households with interactive shopping, information and, most 
likely, Paramount movies on demand. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Viacom trial will almost certainly include movies from other studios 
as well, which is why many entertainment executives say they are not concerned 
about their new, reconfigured competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even we are not conceited enough to think our content is enough to drive a 
whole new service that the consumer doesn't even perceive that they need yet," 
said one industry executive. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, content is still king. Said an MCA executive: "I'm assuming 
the customers of Viacom's cable systems will want to have access to programming 
that they hear is good whether it comes from Universal or Disney or Sony or 
whoever. I don't hear of people wanting to see 'Jurassic Park' because it comes 
from Universal -- but they definitely want to see it." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the nuts-and-bolts technology required to build the new 
distribution system acts as something of a great leveler among the new-age 
media giants. Everyone is grappling with the evolution of new compression 
technologies that allow movies not to appear grainy or jerky when sent over 
fiber cables, the design of new chips to support such compression, and server 
technologies that allow the storage and access of tens of thousands of titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes Bob Lambert, vice president for new technology at Disney, "By and large, 
the technologies being touted as new and improved and able to change the world 
are not coming from the companies that are assembling the infrastructure. They 
are coming from a variety of technology companies across the industry -- and 
that puts everyone else in a pretty even horse race."

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; STUDENTS MEET DEADLINES AMID CHAOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID E. BRADY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Not just back. . .better!" 
</P>
<P>
 That feel-good mantra was everywhere -- on T-shirts, bumper stickers and signs 
-- as Cal State Northridge resumed classes Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was a hard sell for the staff of the student newspaper, the Daily 
Sundial, as it struggled to put out its first issue after the quake-delayed 
start of the spring semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Booted from their second-floor Sierra North digs by the Jan. 17 earthquake, 
Sundial staffers found themselves working shoulder-to-shoulder and occasionally 
on the floor of a cramped storeroom in the campus bookstore, sharing a single 
telephone and several rented computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The day began when students arrived to find that the modular classroom that 
was to be the Sundial's temporary home was still being set up -- and indeed, 
many of the portable buildings in its Prairie Street cluster were still 
off-limits hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 Undeterred, staffers gathered in the shade of a campus food court for an 
introduction-cum-pep talk by faculty adviser Henrietta Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll sit down and talk some other time," she said. "Today we work." 
</P>
<P>
 And they did, including first-time staff writer Michael Symes, who by early 
afternoon had written two stories and was awaiting a third. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today has been real hell," the 20-year-old junior said between assignments. 
"Real hectic." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the chaos of opening day and the problems created by the cramped 
quarters, the mood among reporters and editors was largely upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "My staff has performed excellently," said Paul Bond, the paper's 33-year-old 
editor-in-chief. "The core group has performed above and beyond the call of 
duty." 
</P>
<P>
 While praising his staff's ability to publish a 36-page special edition before 
the start of classes, he acknowledged a bit of regret at the temblor's timing. 
"It's a little disappointing," he said. "We don't have an office. The ideas we 
had are all shelved." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, one editor noted that copies of the Sundial's Feb. 7 earthquake edition 
were disappearing from campus bins faster than staff members could refill them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attention the newspaper is getting is very satisfying," Bond said. "I'm 
told people who have never read it are reading it now." 
</P>
<P>
 And while CSUN's administration failed to deliver on many of its opening day 
promises, Bond offered hearty thanks for the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've done a tremendous job," he said. "It's a huge undertaking. We're open 
and running and that's more than I expected." 
</P>
<P>
 Sundial advertising manager Elizabeth Whirledge said although the staff was 
displaced from its offices, the paper would publish under its usual 
Tuesday-through-Friday schedule beginning today. 
</P>
<P>
 Minor inconveniences, however, remained. Lacking any darkroom facilities in 
their makeshift newsroom, Sundial photographers were having their pictures 
printed at an off-campus site -- a one-hour photo lab. 
</P>
<P>
 For others, the day illustrated the problems that they will encounter covering 
a campus that will be dealing with the quake's crippling effects for years to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was excited yesterday," said staff writer Toya Anderson, 25, as she headed 
off to work Monday afternoon, unable -- because of the disruption on campus -- 
to complete the assignment she'd accepted earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today reality set in."

500,000 REMAIN WITHOUT POWER AFTER STORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 500,000 customers from Arkansas to Delaware were still waiting 
Monday for utility crews to repair power lines broken by a winter storm, and 
residents of hard-hit areas of Arkansas may have to go without electricity for 
2 1/2 weeks, utility officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tennessee, where about 129,000 households and businesses still lacked 
electricity four days after the storm coated trees and power lines with several 
inches of ice, a shelter was opened in Nashville for residents without power. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Holmes, a construction worker, said he stuck it out without electricity at 
home on Friday and Saturday, "but it just got too cold." 
</P>
<P>
 The number of people without power was expected to diminish rapidly as the 
weather warms up to around 60 for parts of Tennessee and about 40 by the 
weekend as far north as New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should make real good progress today (Monday)," said Cecil Whaley of the 
state Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The warming brought its own problems in some areas, as water from melting ice 
caused short circuits and softened the ground supporting utility poles. 
Weakened tree branches were still falling. 
</P>
<P>
 At Milford, Del., where two-thirds of the town's 6,000 residents were without 
electricity at one point, crews managed to get power back to all but about 
1,500 before melting ice started to knock out power again. Some customers lost 
service six times, utility company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trees broken by the ice littered the landscape. Tennessee had more than 200 
people from the forestry department working with 500 National Guard troops on 
chain-saw crews, Whaley said. He said the crews already had worn out many of 
the large saws purchased by the state since Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mississippi, the problems facing repair crews were not just broken tree 
limbs and wires. Some of Mississippi Power & Light's 95-foot-high steel power 
line towers collapsed under the weight of more than a foot of ice on the 
cables. 
</P>
<P>
 MP&L engineers estimated that, with three 500-foot cables running between 
towers, the structures collapsed under as much as 39 tons of ice each.

FLORIDA STUDENT KILLINGS TRIAL DUE TO BEGIN TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CLARY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The gruesome serial killings of five college students -- crimes that shocked 
the nation and terrorized a north Florida town three and half years ago -- will 
be revisited beginning today as the murder trial of a rangy Louisiana drifter 
opens in a Gainesville courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Harold Rolling, 39, is charged with five counts of murder in the 
stabbing and mutilation deaths that took place over three days at the beginning 
of the 1990 fall term at the University of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The slayings were particularly savage -- one of the victims was decapitated, 
three were sexually assaulted and all were stabbed several times. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime scenes -- the apartments where the victims lived -- were so horrific 
that the prosecutor has moved to keep police photos of the bodies sealed. "I 
don't think the loved ones should ever have to see these photos," said the 
chief prosecutor, state attorney Rod Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolling, the son of a retired police officer, already is serving a life prison 
sentence after pleading guilty in 1991 to a grocery store robbery and being 
sentenced as a career criminal. He has previous robbery convictions and has 
been linked to several other crimes, including a triple murder in Shreveport, 
La., and shooting his father in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 If Rolling is convicted of the Gainesville slayings, the state will ask that 
he be executed. "Frankly, in my view, if it is proven that he did these crimes 
in this fashion, then there is only one appropriate penalty and that's death," 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is stuck in the collective memory of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the 36,000 students now enrolled in the largest of Florida's 
state universities were not there when the slayings occurred, the killings are 
an enduring stain. "Students couldn't avoid hearing and reading about it, and 
there's been a lot of media attention leading up to trial," university 
spokesman Joseph Kays said. "But it is not something many students dwell on day 
to day." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, perhaps the most indelible reminder of the murders is a police 
security inspection program for off-campus housing and the 34th Street Wall, 
where graffiti artists years ago memorialized the victims by spray-painting 
their names. That section of the wall is never painted over. 
</P>
<P>
 The knife used to kill Christina Powell, 17, Sonja Larson, 18, Christa Hoyt, 
18, Tracy Paules and Manuel Taboada, both 23, has never been found. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors said their case against Rolling is strong and is based chiefly 
on DNA evidence taken from semen found at the scene and from a jailhouse 
statement Rolling made to a cellmate. 
</P>
<P>
 Cellmate Bobby Lewis provided details of the slayings that only the killer 
could know, police have said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, said to be the only inmate ever to escape from Florida's Death Row, was 
in jail at the time of the killings and was never a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolling's attorney, public defender Rick Parker, refused to comment on defense 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection is expected to take up to three weeks, and the trial itself 
could run through April.

 A federal judge in Philadelphia lifted an injunction that had prevented 
Pennsylvania's restrictive abortion law from taking effect. A state spokesman 
said parts of the five-year-old law could take effect immediately. U.S. 
District Judge Daniel H. Huyett III lifted a ban a week after U.S. Supreme 
Court Justice David H. Souter rejected an appeal by abortion providers. The law 
requires women to receive counseling about alternatives to abortion and then 
wait 24 hours before undergoing the procedure.

 A man who police said wanted money to buy crack cocaine was charged in 
Columbia, Mo., with beating to death three convenience store employees.Ernest 
Lee Johnson, 33, was charged with three counts of first-degree murder, armed 
criminal action and first-degree robbery. Police said they found cash, receipts 
and checks taken from Casey's General Store in Johnson's nearby house. They 
said they also found bloody clothing and tennis shoes belonging to Johnson. The 
sneakers match prints the killer left in the blood on the store's floor, police 
said.

 Researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and 
the Scripps Research Institute said they have successfully used human antibody 
fragments in mice to fight a common pneumonia virus.The study was published in 
the latest Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Pieces of human 
antibody were used to treat mice for respiratory syncytial virus, the major 
worldwide cause of pneumonia in infants and children. Single doses applied by 
nasal spray over three days completely cured the infection, the researchers 
said. It may be eventually possible to develop antibody treatments for other 
viral infections, including influenza and the common cold, researchers said.

PACIFIC BELL TO CONNECT 7,400 SCHOOLS THROUGH COMPUTER, VIDEO NETWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California students could debate each other from opposite ends of the state 
via live television under a $100-million campaign to move public schools and 
libraries onto the "communications superhighway." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell announced Monday that it will wire nearly 7,400 public schools, 
libraries and community colleges in its service territory for computer 
communications and "video-conferencing" by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it would spearhead a consortium to provide the service to all 
other California public schools and libraries by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "By offering a base-line capability to access information from anywhere in the 
world and engage in interactive distance learning, we will be providing every 
public school and library an on-ramp to the communications superhighway," said 
Pacific Bell President Phil Quigley. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plan is approved by the state Public Utilities Commission, Pacific Bell 
will wire targeted schools and libraries and waive the usage charges for a

CHANGE IN SLEEPING HABITS MAY HAVE CUT INFANT DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Reuters 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 University of Washington researchers said Monday that advice to parents 
against allowing infants to sleep face down has reduced the incidence of sudden 
infant death syndrome in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes called crib death, it is the most common cause of death in developed 
countries among children between 1 month and 1 year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the balance of the evidence to be overwhelmingly against the 
continued use of the prone position and that a national campaign to inform 
parents on the risk of the prone position in the first six months of life 
should be given serious consideration," said the report from the University of 
Washington in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was published in the February edition of the Archives of Pediatrics 
and Adolescent Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1992, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that the 
face-down position be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ensuing six months there was a 12% drop in the number of SIDS cases 
reported nationally compared to the previous year, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a national campaign to alert parents to the danger, the study 
said, it should also "draw parents' attention to other actions that will lower 
the risk of sudden death -- namely breast-feeding, not smoking, not having the 
baby sleep in the parents' bed and not overheating the baby with too many 
clothes or blankets." 
</P>
<P>
 In an editorial published in the same journal, Carl Hunt of the Medical 
College of Ohio, in Toledo, cautioned that more study is needed before 
concluding that a change in sleeping position is the sole answer to reducing 
sudden infant deaths.

BREA TEEN-AGER IS CHARGED IN SHOOTING; CRIME: THE 16-YEAR-OLD IS ACCUSED OF 
WOUNDING TWO WESTLAKE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN A BRAWL NEAR THE VENTURA COUNTY 
CAMPUS. HE IS THIRD TEEN CHARGED. 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura County prosecutors on Monday charged a Brea teen-ager with shooting 
two Westlake High School students in a brawl near the campus two weeks ago, 
authorities said. They also charged a Los Angeles County teen-ager as an 
accomplice in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The two teen-agers are the third and fourth 16-year-olds charged in the case, 
which shocked the suburban Thousand Oaks community. Last week, two students 
from Westlake High School were charged in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges against all four boys stem from a brawl that erupted earlier this 
month when one of the defendants and a school football player met for a 
fistfight at North Ranch Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants and others jumped out of a car and announced, "We're the Asian 
Mafia," police and witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants -- all Asian -- then attacked students with bats and lumber 
before shooting into the crowd, investigators said. Three students were shot, 
and others were beaten. All of the injured students have been released from 
local hospitals, including one who suffered a minor skull fracture caused by a 
bullet that lodged in his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. John A. Cardoza said his office will file a petition asking 
that the two teen-agers charged Monday be tried as adults. He has already filed 
a similar motion for the two Ventura County boys. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants from Orange and Los Angeles counties are being held in Juvenile 
Hall and are scheduled to be arraigned in Juvenile Court this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoza said that no other arrests are imminent but that the police 
investigation into the incident is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have said the "Asian Mafia" is believed to be the name of a Los 
Angeles County gang. But law enforcement sources said Monday that none of the 
four boys charged in the melee is believed to be an active gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoza said the Brea youth shot two of the students. He is charged with two 
counts of assault with a firearm, including special allegations that he caused 
great bodily injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles youth, from Rowland Heights, is charged with two counts of 
assault with a firearm and one count of assault with a deadly weapon. The 
firearm charges were filed because the boy assisted in the attack, Cardoza 
said. The third charge was filed because the defendant used a weapon -- either 
a stick or a club -- to attack a member of the crowd, Cardoza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arraignments for the two Ventura County youths were continued until Thursday. 
A defense attorney for one of those boys has said that his client took part in 
the assault because he had been racially and physically harassed by a member of 
the Westlake High football team. 
</P>
<P>
 The football player, who was hit with a bat or a piece of wood during the 
attack, denied the attorney's charges.

U.S. ENDS TRADE CENTER BOMBING CASE; COURTS: PROSECUTION ASKS JURY TO CONVICT 
FOUR DEFENDANTS FOR COMMITTING THE 'WORST TERRORIST ACT' IN U.S. HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In closing arguments in the World Trade Center bombing case, a federal 
prosecutor told jurors Monday that the conspiracy to bomb the twin towers began 
five months before the blast, when one of four defendants arrived in the United 
States carrying bomb-making manuals and anti-American and anti-Jewish 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
 Concluding the government's 18-week case, prosecutor Henry DePippo asked the 
jury to convict all the foreign-born defendants for what he called "the worst 
terrorist act" in the nation's history. The explosion killed six people, 
injured more than 1,000 others and disabled for a month one of the world's 
best-known landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys are scheduled to make their presentations todayin the 
courtroom of U.S. District Judge Kevin T. Duffy. The jury is expected to begin 
its deliberations this week. 
</P>
<P>
 DePippo told jurors that the government's presentation had been a lengthy one 
involving so many witnesses -- more than 200 -- "because no one witness could 
tell the whole story." 
</P>
<P>
 Gesturing to the defendants, he said: "These men not only left chaos and 
horror in their wake, they also left behind some important clues. Now it's time 
to put these pieces together." 
</P>
<P>
 The government has attempted to persuade the jury that the plot began when 
Mohammad Ahmad Ajaj arrived at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport in September, 
1992, describing himself as "a Palestinian protester" and seeking political 
asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration authorities found that he had used an altered Swedish passport and 
had employed a string of false identities. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the prosecutor said, authorities discovered among his possessions 
bombing manuals, videos and handwritten notes indicating that he had received 
weapons and explosives training. 
</P>
<P>
 Ajaj was jailed for immigration violations, DePippo said. An associate, Ramzi 
Ahmed Yousef, who had entered the country on the same flight, met days later in 
New Jersey with two other defendants, Mohammed A. Salameh and Mahmud 
Abouhalima, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yousef, who has been declared a fugitive, left the country only hours after 
the bombing -- before authorities had linked him to the act. 
</P>
<P>
 DePippo said the government's evidence showed that Salameh, with whom Yousef 
shared an apartment, opened a joint bank account with the fourth defendant, 
Nidal Ayyad, a chemical engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Salameh and Ayyad opened an account with $8,500 before withdrawing most of it 
in cash," he said. "They then began making a slew of phone calls to chemical 
companies in order to buy chemicals." 
</P>
<P>
 In one instance, the men used 36 $100 bills to purchase ingredients for a 
1,200-pound bomb -- the one Salameh and Abouhalima drove into the trade 
center's underground garage in a rented van, DePippo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Abouhalima, whom federal investigators labeled the "field general" of the 
plot, was linked to the conspiracy through dozens of telephone calls among the 
defendants, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, federal authorities never were able to trace the source of the funds 
deposited by Salameh and Ayyad in a Jersey City bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer disks found in Ayyad's office identified him as the author of a 
letter sent to New York newspapers claiming that, unless the United States 
stopped supporting Israel, more terrorist bombings would occur. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of conspiracy in the bombing, the defendants could be sentenced 
to life imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 A second trial of 15 alleged high-ranking conspirators, including a blind 
Egyptian sheik, is scheduled to begin in the fall. They have been indicted on 
charges of helping plan the World Trade Center explosion as well as the 
intended destruction of the United Nations building and the Lincoln and Holland 
tunnels connecting New York with New Jersey.

CONVICTED HUD AIDE'S NEW-TRIAL APPEAL DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deborah Gore Dean, convicted of 12 felony counts in the Ronald Reagan-era HUD 
scandal, lost bids Monday for a new trial and for a judge to declare her 
innocent of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The former executive assistant to Housing and Urban Development Secretary 
Samuel R. Pierce Jr. could face up to 57 years in prison and $3 million in 
fines when she is sentenced Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 She was convicted Oct. 26 on three counts of conspiring to defraud the U.S. 
government, one count of accepting an illegal gratuity from a consultant and 
eight counts of lying about her activities at HUD. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean was depicted as being instrumental with others in funneling millions of 
dollars to housing projects that benefited politically connected Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 She testified that although she was the contact point for well-connected 
developers, Pierce made all the key decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, who disclaimed knowledge of the high-level misdeeds in his department, 
has not been charged.

MASTERMIND CONVICTED IN TEEN-AGER'S PRAYER KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 20-year-old was convicted Monday of masterminding the slaying of a teen-ager 
who was garroted as he finished reciting a prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court jury convicted Frank Castaldo of conspiracy to commit murder 
and two counts of attempted murder. He faces a mandatory life sentence at his 
March 25 sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Castaldo directed a group of four teen-agers to kill 
17-year-old Robert Solimine Jr. on Feb. 16, 1992. Three of the teen-agers 
testified that James Wanger, then 17, persuaded Solimine to recite the prayer, 
"Hail Mary," as he sat in the front seat of a car, then strangled him from the 
back seat as he reached the last line. 
</P>
<P>
 Wanger was convicted as an adult of murder and sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The other three teen-agers pleaded guilty in Juvenile Court; one received a 
12-year sentence and two were sentenced to 15 years each. 
</P>
<P>
 The juveniles said their group had a Mafia-type hierarchy led by Castaldo, and 
distributed religious medals to show their unity. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the group grew to dislike Solimine after he stopped drinking and 
tried to get them to do the same, and that they considered him a tattletale and 
pest. 
</P>
<P>
 In one unsuccessful murder plot, the teen-agers said, they planned to put an 
aerosol can in the gas tank of Solimine's car, causing it to explode. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second, they hoped to persuade Solimine to handcuff himself to the 
car's steering wheel so they could set the vehicle afire with him in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaldo cried as officers handcuffed him to take him to jail. His parents and 
attorney left the courtroom without commenting. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Passaic County Prosecutor John Snowdon Jr. said it didn't matter 
that Castaldo was not present during the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of this would have happened if it wasn't for Frank Castaldo," he said. 
"You can't let people escape responsibility because they were not there."

FBI TRANSCRIPTS HAVE KORESH, AIDES DISCUSSING FUEL, FIRE AT COMPOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the hours leading up to a deadly blaze at the Branch Davidian compound, 
eavesdropping FBI agents taped David Koresh and his disciples discussing fuel 
and fire, according to transcripts introduced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Four agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were killed 
as agents stormed the compound near Waco on Feb. 28, 1993.Six Davidians also 
are believed to have died. 
</P>
<P>
 The botched raid led to a 51-day standoff, which ended with the April 19 fire. 
Koresh and 78 followers died in the blaze; 18 cult members had been shot. 
Prosecutors contend the fire was set in a mass suicide pact. 
</P>
<P>
 About 6 a.m. on April 19, FBI agent Byron Sage began warning Davidians to 
surrender and telling them that tear gas was being fired into the compound. 
</P>
<P>
 The transcript's first reference to fire was an unidentified man asking 
between 6:05 a.m. and 6:10 a.m., "Got any fuel?" 
</P>
<P>
 About 6:19 a.m., according to the transcript, an unidentified man's sentence 
ended with the phrase " . . . start the fire?" 
</P>
<P>
 According to the transcript, voices belonging to Koresh and his top assistant, 
Steven Schneider, discussed Coleman heating fuel at about 9:20 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11:40 a.m., an unidentified voice was quoted as saying "I want a fire 
around the back." 
</P>
<P>
 The transcript ends with someone saying, "Let's keep that fire going. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The listening device went dead at 11:56 a.m. because a tank ran over it, FBI 
agent Matthew Gravelle testified Monday. The fire erupted about noon after 
armored vehicles battered the compound and tear gas was launched inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors in the federal murder trial of 11 Branch Davidians were to hear 
excerpts today from the conversations described in the transcripts. FBI agents 
made the tapes with electronic bugging devices.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: HUNTWAY PARTNERS REPORTS PROFIT IN 4TH QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Huntway Partners L.P., a Valencia limited partnership that operates oil 
refineries used to produce liquid asphalt for road construction, reported a 
$1.09-million fourth-quarter profit. 
</P>
<P>
 The results reflected improved operating margins and reduced costs due to its 
debt restructuring and shutdown of its Arizona refinery, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 A year before, Huntway lost $3.36 million. The profit turnaround in the 
quarter that ended Dec. 31 was despite a 26% decline in revenue, to $20.2 
million from $27.2 million in 1992's fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 For the year, however, Huntway's loss widened to $18.7 million, including 
$19.3 million in charges from the closure of the Arizona operations. In 1992, 
it had a $14.3-million loss. Its 1993 revenue fell 4%, to $100.9 million from 
$104.9 million.

 PerfectData Corp., a maker of computer and office-care products, reported

contrast with a year-earlier profit of $102,000. Revenue fell 12%, to $1.7 
million from $1.92 million.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: PERCEPTRONICS SHOWS PROFIT OF $749,724 IN 3RD QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perceptronics Inc., a Woodland Hills developer of computer-simulation software 
used for military and commercial training, reported fiscal third-quarter and 
nine-month profits, despite its revenue falling by more than half. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it managed the profits because it paid off 40% of its 
long-term debt, resulting in a one-time gain of $1.37 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In its fiscal third quarter that ended Dec. 31, Perceptronics earned $749,724, 
in contrast with a year-earlier loss of $1.95 million. Its revenue in the 
latest quarter was $721,360, down 58% from $1.71 million in revenue a year 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 For the nine months, the company reported a $174,824 profit, and a 58% drop in 
revenue to $4.04 million. A year earlier, it lost $4.85 million on $9.5 million 
in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Perceptronics said its revenues fell because of a temporary suspension of 
production on one of its software products.

QUAKE INSURANCE: MOBILE HOMES' SILVER LINING; DISASTER: MANY TRAILERS WERE 
KNOCKED OFF THEIR BLOCKS OR BURNED. MOST OWNERS ARE COVERED BUT SOME CAN'T PAY 
THE DEDUCTIBLE. 
</P>

<P>
 If there's a silver lining for owners of earthquake-damaged mobile homes, it's 
that most were insured for quakes, compared with just one-third of all other 
houses in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Although about 5,600 mobile homes -- or one out of 10 in Los Angeles County -- 
were deemed unlivable after the Jan. 17 temblor, most are expected to be 
rebuilt because quakes are usually included as part of a mobile home owner's 
comprehensive insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 85% of the people here didn't think they had earthquake insurance but 
they found out they had it," said Curt Atwell, owner of Crest Mobile Home 
Village in Simi Valley. Atwell said all but two or three of the 40 homeowners 
at his seniors-only park had earthquake coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Earthquake insurance is one of the greatest benefits of a mobile home 
policy," said Ruth Walker, a spokeswoman for Foremost Insurance of Grand 
Rapids, Mich., the nation's biggest insurer of mobile homes, which has about 
150,000 policyholders in California. Walker says Foremost has received 2,707 
claims related to the Northridge earthquake and expects a net loss of $13 
million -- larger than its losses from Hurricane Andrew in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with insurance, however, many residents of mobile home parks who are 
retired or earn small incomes say they can't afford to cover their $2,000 to 
$3,000 earthquake deductible payments. Mobile home policies often come with a 
5% deductible of the property value, compared with 10% deductibles for 
conventional homeowner earthquake policies, which must be paid out-of-pocket 
before insurance kicks in. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance will be crucial to rebuild places such as Tahitian Mobile Home Park 
in Sylmar, where more than 60 of the 240 mobile homes went up in flames from 
the earthquake. Last week charred remains of ovens, car shells and twisted 
metal and ashes littered a large section of the grounds. Many homes were 
emptied of furniture, with only a sign on the windows identifying the insurance 
company and policy number. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you think some people would like to move out here?" asked Jean Priestman, 
who owns a single-wide trailer at space No. 28, just a couple of houses away 
from the hollow remains of a burned trailer. Priestman, 56, bought her trailer 
nine years ago for $30,000. She has a $19,000 mortgage on her property and has 
insurance through Foremost. But the quake has made Priestman fearful of living 
in mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think mobile homes are that safe," she said, sitting inside her dark 
and cold trailer, still without utilities. "It's going to be scary," Priestman 
said before she launched into a description of the pandemonium that reigned the 
morning of Jan. 17 when it appeared the whole park would go up in flames. "I'm 
not anxious to be here alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Priestman said she would rebuild. But some owners at Tahitian and other mobile 
home parks have walked away from their damaged homes, contractors and residents 
say, and others have sold their damaged trailers on the spot for as little as 
$3,000. There are renewed safety concerns at many mobile home communities, and 
many residents worry about further depreciation of their homes, which have 
trouble keeping their values even in good economic times. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobile home owners also face higher insurance premiums as a result of the 
earthquake. Foremost last week applied to the state for a 13.6% rate increase. 
That is on top of a 29% increase granted earlier this year for Foremost and 19% 
for American Federation, a Foremost subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Foremost, among other insurers of mobile homes, currently charges between $200 
and $300 in annual premium for a comprehensive mobile home policy in 
California. That's relatively expensive given that an average trailer sells for 
about $30,000 -- or about one-seventh the price of a single-family house in the 
region. Conventional home insurance premiums typically run $500 to $600 a year 
without earthquake coverage, which costs an additional $2 per $1,000 coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm, the state's biggest insurer of homes, says it charges about $150 
in annual premium for a typical mobile home policy, and it costs an extra 15% 
for special earthquake coverage. State Farm has about 15,000 policyholders in 
the Los Angeles area, but the insurer did not have a breakdown for mobile home 
claims from the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's Housing and Community Development Department reports that of the 
5,600 mobile homes that were severely damaged by the quake, about 4,500 
trailers slid off their tripod supports. Most of these were in the San Fernando 
Valley, but the quake also affected several mobile home parks in Simi Valley. 
In all, state figures show that 184 mobile homes burned to the ground in fires 
ignited mainly by ruptured gas lines from the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The extent of the damage and the pace of repairs since the quake vary widely 
from one park to the next. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sunburst Park Mobile Homes in Chatsworth, all but a few of the 118 homes 
lurched off their tripod piers. Two trailers burned down, one killing a 
92-year-old woman when her home burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
 J K Construction, an Orange County-based contractor that has set up its own 
trailer for an anticipated yearlong repair at Sunburst, said it has already 
raised 80 trailers back on their tripods at a cost of $1,500 to $3,500 each. 
The overall repair bills for a trailer at Sunburst will be much higher, work 
crews said, because floors, aluminum sidings and awnings, wood paneling and 
utility lines all have to be fixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bev Miller, a 17-year resident of Sunburst, says she is fortunate to have 
survived. The earthquake caused her double-wide home to move three feet and 
land on the ground, crushing water and utility lines underneath her trailer and 
causing a main gas leak that wasn't shut off until 24 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said we were real lucky we didn't have a fire," said Miller, who with 
her husband, Jim, have since lived in a rented motor home parked next to their 
trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside her spacious 1,500-square-foot home, the chandelier and ceiling fan 
were both down, walls were cracked and the ceiling was bent. Bev Miller 
estimated total repair bills at around $30,000 -- the price the Millers paid 
for the home 17 years ago. The Millers have an $80,000 policy through Michigan 
Millers Insurance, another specialty carrier based in Lansing, Mich., for which 
they pay $400 a year in premium. And their deductible is $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Millers, who are in their 60s, have applied for a grant from the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency. Bev Miller says she would like to move her trailer 
to Arizona, to get away from earthquakes, increasing crime in the Valley and 
the $400 a month they now pay for space rent. But she said a move was unlikely. 
"A few years ago they said it would cost us $8,000 to move it 100 miles," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the high cost of hauling mobile homes is the main reason most 
manufactured houses never leave their first site. A mobile home, long viewed as 
a stepchild of the housing industry, also does not hold its value as well as a 
conventional house. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last couple of years mobile home values have dropped 25% to 45%," says 
Anne Hetherington, a Remax real estate agent in Granada Hills who has 
specialized in mobile homes for the last 15 years. While Hetherington doesn't 
expect the earthquake to hurt the mobile home market much, she says it won't 
help it, either. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sylmar, at the Tahitian Mobile Home Park, resident Sharon Frick still 
remembers the morning of the earthquake. "Oooh, it was such a boom," she said. 
"The fire started, we had to get out, but the door was stuck. All the gas mains 
were exploding. . . . If there's another earthquake, it's all going to happen 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Frick, too, had insurance, but she wasn't sure she could pay the $2,000 
deductible because she has been laid off from her job. Her employer, a 
Robinson-May Co. store in the Topanga Mall in Canoga Park, was damaged by the 
quake and it may not reopen for several months. "I don't know, it's so 
discouraging," she said. "It looks like a bomb hit this place. All our 
neighbors are gone." 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, at a big, family-oriented trailer park called Simi Country, 
few of the 250 mobile homes that were toppled had been raised back up and most 
were without utility. At space No. 159 one day last week, Connie Lial stood 
nearby her pink trailer. When she saw a visitor pass by, she said eagerly, "Are 
you from FEMA?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lial, unemployed, said she does not have earthquake insurance. "Everything is 
down inside. The roof leaks. The carpet's all wet. I don't have no light, no 
gas, no water. Nothing."

EX-CRAY CHIEF THINKING BIG WITH SMALL FIRM; TECHNOLOGY: JOHN ROLLWAGEN BECOMES 
CHAIRMAN OF PLASMA & MATERIALS, A FIRM WHOSE MACHINES ETCH COMPUTER CHIPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It's a long way from heading supercomputer giant Cray Research, but for John 
Rollwagen, working with a small company often confused with a blood bank is 
like deja vu . 
</P>
<P>
 "I absolutely fell in love with it," he said of Plasma & Materials 
Technologies Inc., based in Chatsworth. "It reminded me so much of Cray in the 
middle '70s, I could hardly stand it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the local Yellow Pages mistakenly lists it as a blood-products 
center, Plasma & Materials Technologies is actually a manufacturer of 
million-dollar machines used to etch materials on the surface of computer 
chips. Last month, it scored an apparent coup, naming Rollwagen as its 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollwagen, 53, is best known as the former chief executive of Cray. For 12 
years, he presided over the growth of a start-up into an $800-million-a-year 
supercomputing powerhouse. Last year he quit Cray and was tapped by the Clinton 
Administration as deputy secretary of the Commerce Department, but he resigned 
as acting deputy secretary before confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes that PMT, like the young Cray Research, has a unique technology 
and is poised to make a breakthrough. In Greg Campbell, 34, one of PMT's 
co-founders, the company has a boyish chief executive the same age as Rollwagen 
when he started at Cray. "This is the year for PMT," Rollwagen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some industry analysts are dubious. Can Rollwagen, who will continue to live 
in Minnesota while maintaining only a part-time position at PMT, give the 
company a credibility boost in a tough market? Can the Cray magic work in a 
different environment? 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Rollwagen was on a completely different track. After a long stint 
at Minneapolis-based Cray, he left for Washington in January, 1993, nominated 
for the No. 2 job at Commerce. It was, he thought, "an opportunity to make a 
broader contribution and pay something back for what I had received myself at 
Cray." 
</P>
<P>
 But disillusionment quickly set in. 
</P>
<P>
 He figured Secretary Ron Brown "could take care of the politics and I could 
take care of the business, so to speak, of the Commerce Department," he 
recalled. "Well, that was naive. I wasn't as much a politician as he. I have 
nothing against politicians, but I'm not one." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When he resigned in May, Rollwagen considered seeking a top position at a 
company of Cray's stature. But he decided to pursue a different kind of 
challenge and lend his expertise to smaller firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollwagen started working as an adviser to St. Paul Venture Capital, a 
financial group that has invested in PMT. St. Paul publicized his arrival in 
its newsletter -- and that made interesting reading for an ambitious, young 
executive in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Campbell, a Ph.D. in plasma physics from UCLA, founded PMT in 1990 with 
his professor, Robert Conn. They developed a high-powered technology for 
producing gaseous plasmas -- ionized gases that when stripped of their 
electrons are highly reactive. 
</P>
<P>
 PMT's technology makes a plasma out of chlorine gas; ionizing chlorine is a 
highly efficient way of creating a chemical reaction with film on top of a 
silicon wafer. 
</P>
<P>
 Semiconductor manufacturers use plasma to engrave the patterns of electrical 
circuits onto the surface of their chips. The complex process requires huge 
plasma machines that commonly cost around $1 million each. With those kinds of 
numbers, as Campbell said, "if you make it in this industry, you make it big." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's also a tough market to get into. About 60% of it is shared by five large 
companies, said G. Dan Hutcheson, president of VLSI Research in San Jose. A 
spokesman for one of the five, Applied Materials Inc. in Santa Clara, said the 
company took in about $300 million in etching sales last year. The worldwide 
market for plasma-etch machines amounts to about $1 billion. At the moment, PMT 
is a pipsqueak, with about 1% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutcheson said credibility is a key issue for any company trying to break into 
the plasma-etch market. "People want to know if they order 100 of these 
machines, can the company build them? Will they go out of business?" 
</P>
<P>
 PMT, which employs 60 people and sells machines under the names Pinnacle and 
Apex, predicts revenues of $11 million for the year ending Feb. 28, and 
Campbell says the company is profitable. In the coming year, it expects to 
reach up to $25 million in sales and do well enough to mount a public stock 
offering. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by $12 million in private financing, which helped PMT develop a 
prototype and make further refinements, the company has made some progress. It 
has contracts with Canon and NEC in Japan. Sematech, the U.S. government-backed 
consortium of computer chip manufacturers, awarded it a contract to develop an 
advanced etching machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell has ambitions well beyond that. "I think we can really explode the 
thing," he said. "Applied Materials will laugh at us, but that's where I see 
us. There's room." 
</P>
<P>
 PMT is betting that it has a technical edge in its product, which enables it 
to produce more ions, which can process more silicon chips per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 To help fuel sales potential, Campbell felt he needed a mentor, someone with 
credibility and expertise who "had been through the ride before." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he read St. Paul's newsletter. He had been looking for a new chairman 
since Conn accepted the job of dean of engineering at UC San Diego, and he had 
been a fan of Rollwagen's since reading a Harvard Business School case study on 
Cray. He called St. Paul and requested a meeting with him. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Rollwagen visited the company in Chatsworth, fell in love and 
agreed to become chairman "on the spot." 
</P>
<P>
 Still based in Minneapolis, Rollwagen devotes about 25% of his time to PMT. 
The rest is divided among other companies he advises in North Carolina, New 
Jersey and the Czech Republic. At each company, he has settled for an equity 
stake rather than a high salary. 
</P>
<P>
 "On that basis, if things work out, everybody's going to be very happy, myself 
included," he said. "If they don't work out, they won't have wasted a lot of 
money on me." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell has no doubts about the arrangement. "John will really help us in 
terms of giving the company credibility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts demur. Plasma etching is more about chemistry than 
electronics, Hutcheson noted. "People from Cray don't have much credibility in 
this industry. It's kind of like if someone came in from Ford. They're so far 
apart.  
</P>
<P>
 "They (PMT) just need to sell something," he added. "It's a matter of can they 
get people to buy it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Jones, general partner of Brentwood Associates, a West Los Angeles 
venture capital investor in PMT, counters by pointing out that Rollwagen dealt 
regularly with semiconductor companies when he was at Cray. Campbell said: 
"We've only just started wheeling him out." 
</P>
<P>
 By using those contacts, Rollwagen can open sales doors for PMT. Campbell has 
also used Rollwagen to help recruit new staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this coming year, if we even sell two machines that wouldn't have sold 
otherwise, that's a huge difference," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Rollwagen believes he can make a contribution just by playing 
the mentor role and helping to keep PMT's entrepreneurial drive going. "I've 
been down the road from zero to almost a billion dollars," he said, referring 
to his experience at Cray. "I think PMT is on that same road and there are some 
lessons to be learned from having done it once." 
</P>
<P>
 He only wishes a John Rollwagen had been around when he started out. "It would 
have saved me some trouble. I could have anticipated certain things and done 
things differently from the way I did. Not hugely differently, but it would 
have been helpful."

HOUSE, CONDOMINIUM SALES PLUNGE 31% IN JANUARY; REAL ESTATE: ACTIVITY WAS 
DISRUPTED BY THE QUAKE. STILL, THE NUMBER OF UNITS SOLD REPRESENTS A 28% JUMP 
FROM THE SAME PERIOD IN '93.

<P>
 Sales of previously owned single-family houses and condominiums plunged 31% in 
January from the 1,080 that sold in December, after disruption caused by last 
month's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 748 houses and condominiums changed hands in January, the San 
Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors reported Monday. Despite the drop from 
December, January's sales marked a 28% increase from the 584 units sold a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The local real estate market ground to a halt for nearly a week after the Jan. 
17 quake, said Alice McCain, president of the local realtors association. The 
Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America said last week that about 21% of pending home 
escrows and refinancings in Southern California were disrupted by the 
earthquake. Also, some economists are predicting that the area will be hit by 
higher unemployment and a short-term drop in real estate prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the real estate business also expect a surge in defaults and 
foreclosures. There were a record 3,650 residential foreclosures in the Valley 
last year -- 20 times more than in 1990, according to TRW-REDI Property Data in 
Riverside. And foreclosures could surge in the coming months because the 
earthquake has left thousands of property owners with significant or 
irreparable damage to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 McCain, however, disputed the notion that the earthquake will affect housing 
prices or delay a recovery of the real estate market that's expected to begin 
this year. After properties were reinspected in the Valley last month, McCain 
said, 75% of the escrows that were pending when the temblor hit closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined average price of houses and condominiums sold in January fell 8%, 
to $218,200 from a $238,100 average a year earlier. The median price also 
declined 8%, to $176,000 from $192,000, meaning that half the units sold for 
more than $176,000 last month and half sold for less. 
</P>
<P>
 The January average price was 5% below December's $229,300 average. The median 
price in January was down 1% from $177,000 in the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
 The association also said its members reported more prospective buyers 
shopping for homes because of low interest rates, a dwindling inventory of 
houses for sale, lower resale prices and -- as a result of the earthquake -- 
people hunting for new places to live. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who have lived in the Valley for a long time and have jobs are not 
fleeing and they are not giving up," McCain said. "They're rebuilding. Or 
they're taking disaster loans and buying a replacement residence." 
</P>
<P>
 Single-family house sales rose 29% to 634 in January, from 492 a year earlier. 
But the January sales figure was down 30% from 908 in December. 
</P>
<P>
 The average price of detached houses sold last month was $234,200, down 9% 
from $256,500 in January, 1993, and 5% below December's average price of 
$246,700. The median house price in January fell 13% to $185,000 from $213,000 
a year ago, and was down 3% from $190,000 in December. 
</P>
<P>
 The average price of condominiums sold in January fell 7%, to $129,300 from 
$139,500 a year before. Last month's average price was 6% lower than the 
$137,700 in December. Meanwhile, the median price of condominiums sold declined 
11% to $125,000 from $140,000 in January a year ago, and was 4% below the 
$130,000 median price in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of condominiums grew 24% to 114 last month, from 92 in January, 1993, 
but fell 34% from 172 in December. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 9,346 houses and condominiums were listed for sale last month, down 
18% from the 11,409 listings in January, 1993, and 4% fewer than 9,759 in 
December. Last month's total included 1,907 new listings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley realty association, the largest in the state, has 7,800 members 
from North Hollywood to Calabasas. Its figures do not include sales of most new 
residences. January Valley Home Sales

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: DATAMETRICS LINKS LOSSES TO EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Datametrics Corp., a Chatsworth maker of computer printers and communications 
products, said it expects to post a net loss for its fiscal first quarter 
because of problems related to last month's Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three months ended Jan. 31 last year, Datametrics earned a profit of 
$300,000 on revenue of $5.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
 The company said the loss it anticipates for the most recent quarter is 
largely due to unrealized sales because the Jan. 17 earthquake and aftershocks 
disrupted its manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 Datametrics said the company is now in full operation and expects to be 
profitable for its fiscal second quarter.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: BENTON SAYS SETTLEMENT OF SUIT ERASES CLOUD ON LEASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Benton Oil & Gas Co., an Oxnard energy concern, said the state of Louisiana 
has agreed to settle its lawsuit with Texaco over the calculation of royalties 
owed by Texaco under certain leases. 
</P>
<P>
 The leases in question are for properties that Benton has stakes in: the West 
Cote Blanche Bay Field, in which Benton has a 43% working interest, and the 
Rabbit Island and Belle Isle fields, in which Benton has working interests of 
25%. 
</P>
<P>
 Benton's interests in these fields, which represent substantially all of the 
company's domestic reserves and production, were originally owned by Texaco 
under leases granted by Louisiana. Benton began acquiring the interests in 
1990. Benton was not a party to the litigation, but the dispute "caused a cloud 
on Benton's title to these properties," the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement is subject to final approval by the Louisiana State Mineral 
Board and a fairness hearing by a U. S. District Court.

approve a 21.8% rate increase for homeowner insurance policies issued by the 
company.Woodland Hills-based 20th Century Insurance Co., a subsidiary of 20th

due to the claims it has paid out after the Northridge earthquake last month.

 20th Century said it was the first time that it has asked for permission to 
raise premiums on homeowner policies since the company began offering homeowner 
insurance in 1982.

amount to $160 million.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; BUSINESSES ON SHAKEN BLOCK FIGHT TO SURVIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the door of her small shop on Reseda Boulevard, Roya Saberzadeh surveyed 
the scene outside. Along the block, one apartment building after another was 
condemned, including the Northridge Meadows complex just across the street, 
where 16 people died in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Guard troops that had patrolled the area in the first days after 
the temblor were gone. The crowds of sightseers that had for weeks packed this 
hard-hit street about a mile from the earthquake's epicenter were dying down. 
And Saberzadeh was left to ponder her future. 
</P>
<P>
 At her shop, Rochie's Greek Row, which sells clothes and memorabilia with 
insignias from college fraternities and sororities, Saberzadeh has cleaned up 
broken glass, replaced merchandise on shelves and repaired ceiling tiles. She 
reopened two weeks after the earthquake with only one of four sewing machines 
operating, a damaged heat-sealing machine and broken wood-cutting devices. With 
no earthquake insurance and $50,000 in damages, she wonders how she'll pay her 
$2,000 rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Saberzadeh waited for hours at Federal Emergency Management Agency centers, 
and is now hoping for a low-interest emergency loan from the Small Business 
Administration. But she was discouraged when the SBA told her she needs 
extensive records, including tax filings and profit and loss statements, after 
which loan approval could take two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with a loan, Saberzadeh said her business would still be on shaky ground. 
Most small business owners, she said, barely pay the bills. "Where am I going 
to get the other $600 or $700 a month to pay for the loan? The economy is 
already bad enough, and my savings are depleted." 
</P>
<P>
 And so it goes for the dozens of merchants in this rattled block of three 
strip malls, full of delicatessens, nail salons and dry cleaners near the 
wrecked Northridge Meadows apartments. These small businesses, and two mall 
landlords, continue to grapple with the recovery from the earthquake -- giving 
rise to some frayed nerves and tensions. Looking to the future, they face the 
prospect that the apartment dwellers and Cal State Northridge students who once 
frequented their establishments may have left the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a month after the 6.8 magnitude earthquake, many window panes along the 
street are still boarded up and some stores remain dark. Saberzadeh's brother, 
Ramin Bezadi, who has two shops in the same mall as his sister, has seen only a 
few customers return to his fitness salon, and none to his tanning salon. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the earthquake, most of these merchants survived day-to-day. For 
many, that was enough to hold onto their dreams, to have a little something of 
their own. They worked long hours, taking in a few hundred to a few thousand 
dollars in sales each day. Most carry no earthquake insurance because of the 
high premiums and deductibles. And now all are waiting and hoping that, once 
walls and ceilings are patched and windows restored, customers will come. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one merchant has already called it quits. 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Pass opened the Ten Little Piggies children's shoe store 2 1/2 years ago 
in the Northridge Garden Center strip mall, a few doors north of the Northridge 
Meadows apartments. It has been slow going because of the recession, Pass said, 
and now the time she would have to stay closed while her shop is repaired would 
mean the loss of income needed to buy her spring shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're just hanging on, to come up with more money to pay your bills . . 
. it's just not worth it," Pass said. 
</P>
<P>
 So she is holding a fire sale in the garage of her Northridge home, selling 
$40 brand-name sneakers for $20. Her store manager, who lived in a 
now-condemned apartment building, is packing up and moving to Colorado. Two 
weeks ago a shopkeeper from Glendora stopped by and bought some of her wall 
hooks and displays. "It hurt," Pass said. "It just hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Hairo and Pierre Hairbetian, father and son owners of Andre's Shoe Repair, 
next to Rochie's Greek Row, said business has been practically nonexistent 
since the earthquake. After 11 years, they will have to cut prices and spend 
more money on advertising to bring customers back -- money they don't have. 
"Mentally, we're destroyed," Pierre said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few doors down, Gianni Fontana di Trevi looked glum as he flipped through 
receipts at his dry-cleaning and tailor shop. In the past few years, though 
business was slow, he paid the bills with his usual $200 in daily sales. But 
more than two weeks after the earthquake, his sales had fallen to $108 one day, 
$53 the next. 
</P>
<P>
 The meager business Fontana di Trevi gets now is mostly to clean clothes 
soiled during the earthquake. "But for how long?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, we were happy we were alive. Now I worry about the business. This is 
my life." 
</P>
<P>
 In the strip mall across the street, Ben Hur reopened his Zeppelin Cleaners 
last Tuesday, having fixed his ceiling and equipment. The next three months, he 
believes, will determine whether he can remain in business. Until then, Hur 
said, he'll open his doors each day and turn on the noisy dry-cleaning 
machines. "After more than three weeks that they were off, it's a good sound -- 
like music." 
</P>
<P>
 The tenants in these mini-malls aren't the only ones suffering. The landlords 
have their own demons to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Burnam, whose family owns the Northridge Garden Center, has spent the 
past month phoning contractors, meeting with structural engineers, talking to 
tenants and renegotiating her mortgage loan. 
</P>
<P>
 About half the shops in Burnam's strip mall have reopened, but some remain 
yellow-tagged for "limited entry" by the Building and Safety Department. Some 
ceiling tiles need replacing, and cracks in doors, walls and floors must be 
patched. Two weeks ago, on plywood put up on a store window in Burnam's mall, 
this message was spray-painted in red: "We Lost Everything. We Will Miss You." 
That depressing sign has since come down. For Burnam, even finding an "Open For 
Business" banner proved problematic as local suppliers were sold out. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnam feels caught between her tenants, who can't afford to pay rent, and her 
mortgage lender. She estimated it will cost $250,000 for all the repairs, and 
she doesn't have earthquake insurance. "I truly have no money to run the 
center," she said. "My bills right now exceed the money in my checking 
account." 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to sell the strip mall would be tough because of the depressed real 
estate market. Allowing the lender to foreclose is an option, Burnam said -- 
but hardly an attractive one. 
</P>
<P>
 The other strip mall landlord nearby, William Matthews, shares similar woes. 
Matthews' family owns the two facing strip malls on Reseda Boulevard, where 
Rochie's Greek Row and Zeppelin Cleaners are situated, and runs the malls' 
management company, Mat West Co. in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven commercial and industrial properties owned by the Matthews family 
trust in the Northridge area are all damaged, and with no earthquake insurance 
the repairs could total $750,000, Matthews estimated. At the two Reseda 
Boulevard strip malls, many of the T-bars in the ceilings crumpled, toilets 
blew off their bolts, a concrete sheer wall toppled and the roofs ruptured in 
places. Every aftershock worsened the damage; a few units remain yellow-tagged. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews has pulled workers from his Upland office to help with the cleanup 
and repairs, but, he said, "I've only got so many crews, so much time." 
</P>
<P>
 Some shop owners have asked for relief from paying rent, which both Matthews 
and Burnam said they'll consider on a case-by-case basis. As frustrations 
mount, tensions between the property owners and some tenants have surfaced. 
Matthews said a couple of unhappy tenants locked his workers out of their 
stores, blocking the repair of broken pipes that flooded other shops with 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 At Northridge Garden Center, Bea's Swim & Sport owner Helmut Behensky 
complained that loose roof tiles were in danger of falling. He contended that 
Burnam, the landlord, and some other tenants were rushing to reopen shops 
before enough repairs were made. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnam countered that maintenance workers have been removing roof tiles that 
might pose a danger, as instructed by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. "There 
are tenants who don't want the center to reopen" because of the slow economy, 
she said. "They'd rather get out of their lease." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, all is not bleak along this earthquake-torn block. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura D'Angelo, owner of the Kids at Heart gift shop in Northridge Garden 
Plaza, has reopened and resumed hosting children's birthday parties and crafts 
demonstrations. On her boarded-up windows she painted in pink and red, "Open 
For Fun," and hopes to pick up some business now that the badly damaged 
Northridge Fashion Center shopping mall a mile away won't reopen until July. 
</P>
<P>
 One of D'Angelo's new products, a rubber stamp that says "We Survived the 
Northridge Quake," sold out quickly and she has reordered more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some days," D'Angelo said, "I think I can make it through." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street, Howard and Elise Kuebler reopened their sandwich shop, My 
Hero, within a week after the earthquake, in time for their 30th anniversary in 
business. The Kueblers feel luckier than most, since their savings will cover 
the $20,000 in damages at the shop. Lunchtime crowds have been brisk since 
reopening. Longtime customers come, Howard said, "hell or high water." 
</P>
<P>
 And at Rochie's Greek Row, Roya Saberzadeh vowed she would survive.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; SURVIVOR RETURNS TO CLASS AT CSUN; AFTERMATH: 
ROBERT DORSEY'S THREE ROOMMATES DIED IN THE NORTHRIDGE MEADOWS COLLAPSE. HE 
STILL REPLAYS THE TRAGEDY IN HIS MIND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just a month after his three roommates died around him, Robert Dorsey, 25, 
went back to classes at Cal State Northridge on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 He still has trouble sleeping, still plays the scenes endlessly in his head: 
his ground-level apartment crushed under two upper stories of the collapsed 
Northridge Meadows complex, his roommates suffocated in their beds only yards 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 The rib he cracked trying to shove himself out from under the fallen ceiling 
is healing. He can walk without crutches on the leg that was compressed so hard 
and so long he thought it would be amputated. He no longer coughs up the little 
white balls that formed in his throat from inhaling drywall dust while pinned 
in the blackness. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the Jan. 17 earthquake killed 16 of his friends and neighbors at 
Northridge Meadows, Dorsey had survived high-speed motorcycle crashes and a 
fiery car explosion. He survived the Persian Gulf War as an Army 
machine-gunner. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he is the lone survivor of Apartment 104. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his roommates' deaths, Dorsey was eager to get back to his computer 
science and math classes at CSUN, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 College is Dorsey's top priority. In his first semester last fall, he earned a 
4.0 grade point average. He hopes to transfer to UCLA or UC Berkeley in two 
years, and later obtain a master's degree. 
</P>
<P>
 And he feels no guilt, he said, over emerging alive from Apartment 104. 
Trapped himself, there was nothing he could have done to save his roommates, he 
said, and he takes comfort in that knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certain events I go through and I accept, and then I get on with my life," 
said Dorsey, a slim man with reddish-blond hair, an earring and a quiet, 
matter-of-fact manner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walk by that (apartment complex) building and two minutes later I'm on my 
way, thinking about what I've got to get done." 
</P>
<P>
 Discharged last summer after six years in the Army, in which he enlisted 
specifically to get college money, Dorsey enrolled at Cal State Northridge in 
September. He moved into a dorm where he met Manuel Sandoval, 24, a fellow 
computer science major who soon became his best friend. 
</P>
<P>
 By Christmas break, the pair had decided to find a cheaper place to live. 
After checking out dozens of buildings, they settled on the Northridge Meadows, 
a well-maintained complex that sported a courtyard pool, putting green and 
barbecue pits and advertised "resort-style living." 
</P>
<P>
 They moved in two days before the quake, joining two other roommates who had 
arrived five days earlier, Jaime Reyes, a 19-year-old CSUN student, and his new 
girlfriend, Myrna Velazquez, an 18-year-old Valley College student. 
</P>
<P>
 The night before the quake, Dorsey and Sandoval cooked a chicken dinner and 
relaxed in front of the TV. By 1 a.m. Monday, they were asleep in their 
bedroom, and Reyes and Velazquez were asleep in their smaller room nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 When the quake struck at 4:31 a.m., Dorsey leaped out of bed and ran toward 
the door frame. But the wildly heaving floor pitched him atop a three-foot-high 
metal filing cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 Seconds later, the roof caved in, pinning him helplessly, face-down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was smashed into the filing cabinet like somebody stepping on a Coke can, 
crushed right into it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey had the air knocked out of him and could not breathe for a minute or 
so. Terrified that he would suffocate, he heaved himself a few inches forward, 
yanking his chest off the filing cabinet so he could breathe. He pushed so hard 
he cracked a rib. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as he was feeling a bit safer, a sharp aftershock brought the ceiling 
down even more, further constricting his lungs. He could see only 12 inches of 
space between the floor and ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was taking half breaths," he said. "And every aftershock after that, I went 
from half breaths to quarter breaths. I realized that if they don't get me out 
of here soon, I'll go from quarter breaths to eighth breaths to no breaths at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 One of his legs, jammed under debris, felt like it had lost circulation. When 
he touched it, he felt nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside on Reseda Boulevard, fire trucks raced by, sirens wailing. But none 
stopped. He realized the quake probably had wrecked lots of apartment 
buildings, and figured that he might be trapped for days. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey tried to stay calm. To get excited meant his heart and lungs worked 
faster, and that only produced more pain. But when he thought of his roommates, 
he began to scream. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just kept screaming out their names, saying, 'Talk to me, tell me you're 
alive, tell me you're in good condition,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval, dead in his bed about 15 feet away, made no sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey felt himself envying his three dead roommates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell you the truth, I felt jealous. Because I was so sure that I was going to 
die that I was thinking, 'Gee, I wish I could have gone painless and quick like 
that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey heard voices from the sidewalk, people talking and laughing just a few 
yards away. But when he started yelling for help, no one responded. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all stopped talking. It was like bystander apathy. They all stood around 
waiting for somebody else to come over." One woman, he said, even told him to 
"stop your whining." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, a man came to Dorsey's aid. He told Dorsey that Fire Department 
rescue crews were en route. Then he began chipping away at the debris with a 
claw hammer. 
</P>
<P>
 After they arrived, the fire fighters worked quickly and efficiently. But they 
apparently did not realize Dorsey's back was actually jammed against the 
ceiling, which they were trying to cut through from the apartment above. 
</P>
<P>
 A chain saw slashed through the ceiling next to his head. Dorsey shouted to 
his rescuers that they were in danger of cutting him, and they began slicing 
only part way through the ceiling and then cracking it with sledgehammers. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the ceiling was weakened to the point that Dorsey used his arms and 
back to punch through it. "It was the best pushup I ever did," he said. 
Firefighters hauled him out through an apartment window, using a door as a 
makeshift stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been trapped in the rubble for 2 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting the overwhelming weight of the collapsed ceiling off him, he said, was 
"beyond relief." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just like being tortured your whole life, and suddenly not knowing 
pain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But within minutes, his body filled with new pain -- from his cracked rib, 
compressed leg and assorted cuts and bruises. Clad only in shorts and a tank 
top, he began shaking violently in the chill morning. He felt himself slipping 
into shock. 
</P>
<P>
 A doctor examined him and sent him by ambulance to Northridge Hospital Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 At the quake-damaged hospital, doctors and nurses in the parking lot were 
frantically seeing which patients most needed medical care. Dorsey had his 
chest and leg X-rayed and then, since he had no life-threatening injuries, was 
given crutches and asked to leave. Someone said they needed his bed. 
</P>
<P>
 With no money and no shoes, Dorsey took a free hospital shuttle bus to the Cal 
State dorms, hoping to find some shelter. But the dorms were closed. Badly 
dehydrated and in pain, Dorsey blacked out three times. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, another Cal State student drove him back to the hospital, where he 
huddled overnight, sleepless, on a small mattress in the lobby. His mother 
arrived the next morning and took him to his parents' home in Petaluma, north 
of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 For two weeks, he could not sleep. He would jump out of bed in the middle of 
the night, hugging the wall and "trying to hold it up," mistakenly believing 
another quake had hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm wide awake . . . I have no problem. It's business as usual," he 
said. "But at night, you just can't fool yourself. Things start to come back. 
You start to rehash everything." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dorsey doesn't expect the flashbacks and night fears to continue for long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a lot of experience with bad, traumatic things. I've come close to 
death several times," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I have very, very good coping skills. This is just one more thing. And I 
think I can deal with it."

MAN DIES IN VALENTINE DAY CONFRONTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First, Charles Edward Lovinggood lost his love. Then, on Valentine's Day, he 
lost his life. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, just 20 minutes into the most sentimental of days, Lovinggood, 45, 
of Reseda, telephoned his estranged wife, Marilyn Eileen Lovinggood, also 45, 
and -- on learning another man was living at her West Hills home -- threatened 
to pay them a visit, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Charles Lovinggood carried out that threat, he got into a fight with the 
other man, who punched him twice in the head. Lovinggood died after his head 
struck the slate tile floor of the house, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said Lovinggood's jealousy was for naught, because Harold Steven 
Cartrett, 29, is just a friend of Marilyn Lovinggood's. He had been living at 
her three-bedroom house for about a month because his own home was damaged 
during the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real shame," said Detective Rick Swanston. "There seems to have been a 
lot of misunderstandings here." 
</P>
<P>
 Charges have not been filed against Cartrett because police said the killing 
appears to have been justifiable. Swanston said Lovinggood had assaulted his 
estranged wife moments before Cartrett punched him. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began after Charles Lovinggood, who had been separated from 
Marilyn for nearly a year, phoned to say he planned to forcibly enter her home, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was angry and said he was going to find out who was living there with her. 
. . . He said he was going to pound the door down," Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
 The door was unlocked when Charles Lovinggood arrived 10 minutes later because 
Cartrett, Marilyn Lovinggood and Marilyn's 14-year-old daughter had just 
arrived home when they received his call and they forgot to lock the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Cartrett had, however, thought to arm himself with a .22-caliber rifle, and he 
ordered Charles Lovinggood to leave the house, Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Lovinggood grabbed his estranged wife and "began shaking her 
violently," Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cartrett put down the rifle, separated the two and slugged Charles Lovinggood 
twice in the face. After the second blow, Lovinggood fell to the floor and hit 
his head, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 He lost consciousness and was pronounced dead by paramedics at 12:51 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation into Cartrett's actions continues, Swanston said.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; BOARD ACCEPTS BID TO BUILD CLASSROOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After nearly a yearlong delay in finding a contractor, the Glendale Board of 
Education has accepted an $8.2-million bid from an Eagle Rock firm to build 35 
additional classrooms at Glendale High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The board hired C.W. Driver & Associates for the project, an 
81,000-square-foot building between the campus cafeteria and girls gym. 
</P>
<P>
 The award brings to a close a nearly yearlong chapter in the district's 
attempt to find a builder for the classroom addition, originally slated to be 
completed by September to relieve crowding at the 2,500-student campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Last April, the board in a 3-2 vote rejected all offers for the project and 
told staff to start the bidding process anew after contractors complained that 
the district's design specifications were not clear. 
</P>
<P>
 As staff went back to the drawing board, the project faced yet another setback 
when state officials told the district to upgrade standards for the building's 
heating and air-conditioning system. 
</P>
<P>
 C.W. Driver officials, who won the contract earlier this month, say they 
expect to complete the building by July 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Groundbreaking is expected to begin Saturday. TOMMY LI

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; YOUTH PROVING HE'S A WINNER IN BOXING RING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the bell rings, Miguel Espino Jr. turns into a 119-pound flurry of fists. 
But at the end of the boxing match, win or lose, he thanks his opponent and 
bows to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Afterward, you have to thank him (your opponent) for a good fight," said 
Miguel, a 13-year-old who after only a few months has become the pride of the 
Los Angeles Police Department's Jeopardy boxing program in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently Miguel, who started competing just two years ago, bested more 
experienced boxers to take second place in the 13- to 14-year-old age category 
at the National Silver Gloves championships in Kansas City, Kan. He lost a 
close bout in the finals to a more experienced boxer from Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his first try at the Silver Gloves title and he is the first LAPD 
Jeopardy boxer to go that far in the championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that he got to the finals in his very first try speaks real well for 
him," said Melanie Ley, a Southern California representative of the USA Amateur 
Boxing Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "He probably doesn't have as much experience as some of the others," she said, 
adding that some boxers his age have been competing for four years, making his 
second-place finish more remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Rodgers, president of National Silver Gloves, said that 300 boxers 
competed in a variety of categories, and that 53 national champions were 
crowned that weekend of Feb. 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these kids obviously will be Olympics-bound," said Rodgers, who added 
that the organization does not aim to make kids into professional boxers -- 
which is what Miguel dreams of becoming. Miguel will be too young to compete in 
the next Olympics, and plans to turn professional when he is 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel trained in the North Hollywood back yard of a neighbor, former 
professional boxer Fidel Briseno, before he joined the LAPD North Hollywood 
Division's Jeopardy program last fall. The program, which meets daily at a Sun 
Valley park, is aimed at keeping kids from joining gangs by offering them 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel first put on boxing gloves when he was 3. Briseno, who was forced into 
retirement because of a detached retina, took him under his wing within the 
last two years, when his training began. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he's ready to go, bang! He really gives a show for you," Briseno said. 
"I give him maybe another year and there will be no other kid who can match his 
ability." 
</P>
<P>
 To succeed, Miguel has had to remain dedicated to the sport, an attitude 
police officers who run the Jeopardy program hope will rub off on the other 
boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's respected," said Officer Manuel Martinez. "He helps coach the little 
guys and they look up to him because he's a proven winner." 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel's father said he knew his son would stick with boxing, not because he 
won his first seven straight boxing matches, but because he stayed with it 
after his first loss in his eighth bout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each loss, I think, is a learning experience," Miguel said. ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; RESIDENTS SOUND OFF ON TV TOWN HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Burbank residents can now berate, applaud or question their city leaders from 
the comfort of their living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a little getting used to," Councilwoman Susan Spanos said of the 
Electronic Towne Hall, a televised half-hour session during which residents can 
telephone City Council chambers and offer their comments on local issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The electronic session, which begins an hour before the first City Council 
meeting of the month, is part of the continuing effort to create more openness 
in local government, officialssaid. 
</P>
<P>
 The next town hall is scheduled for March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last year, televised coverage of City Council meetings has been 
expanded and Mayor George Battey Jr. has created his own "Ask the Mayor" 
program on Wednesday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 The town hall format calls for the mayor, council members and other city 
officials to respond to callers' queries and comments at the conclusion of the 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't quite work that way the first time around on Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our operators are waiting," Battey said as council members readied for the 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
 To fill time, council members and city officials answered a few questions 
immediately after some of the 11 calls that came in during the half hour.  
</P>
<P>
 Residents who called wanted information about earthquake damage, the Magnolia 
Park Neighborhood Committee, the city's cable television contract, the school 
district's $100-million bond issue, development controls and attempts to bring 
in a new industry to replace Lockheed Corp., among other topics. 
</P>
<P>
 One caller, identified as Cheryl, asked about an agenda item in which the 
council was asked to allow a restaurant-club to move into downtown.  
</P>
<P>
 She wondered why that would even be an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to know why that is," Cheryl said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had delayed the matter for three weeks to allow city officials to 
review land-use issues in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Burbank needs more restaurants in that area." 
</P>
<P>
 "What about bringing in bigger employers?" a caller named Doug asked about 
efforts to fill the void left when Lockheed Corp. began a pullout in 1990.  
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the city lost 15,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice if we got more participation," Councilman Bob Bowne said at 
the end of the first town hall session.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they hope more residents will call in as the public 
becomes more familiar with the format. 
</P>
<P>
 "It went well for a first run-through," Vice Mayor Bill Wiggins said. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: CHAMBER TO GET OWN CABLE TV SHOW

<P>
 The San Fernando Chamber of Commerce will merge onto the information 
superhighway -- albeit in the slow lane -- with its own cable-access television 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Conan O'Brien was booked and Chevy Chase unavailable, so chamber member Brad 
Buckley tapped his wife, Danielle Sullivan, for the host position on the show, 
which will feature local politicians, pundits and business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of those things where I'm familiar with her work -- obviously -- 
and, biases aside, she does good work," said Buckley, who heads the chamber's 
business improvement committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan hosts a radio talk show on KMGX, Magic FM, Sundays at 7 a.m., and 
hosts a cable show once a month, Buckley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental Cablevision, which will grant the chamber free air and studio 
time, has not picked a slot for the show, so Buckley has no idea if he will 
compete with shows such as "Married With Children" or a Soloflex infomercial. 
"The idea behind the show is to promote the city, not only to residents, but 
people who live outside the boundaries," Buckley said. "We want to enhance the 
city's image. A lot of people don't know about the city and what it has to 
offer." 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber will spend six weeks training a crew, then begin airing its 13 
shows in April, Buckley said. GEOFFREY MOHAN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: LOS ANGELES; HOUSING PANEL URGES CITY TO HIRE LAW FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles City Council committee recommended Monday hiring a law firm to 
argue for an increased spending limit on a downtown redevelopment project and 
defend against a lawsuit by former Councilman Ernani Bernardi. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardi, a longtime critic of redevelopment projects who retired in June, 
filed a suit in December alleging that closed-door sessions of the Council's 
housing and redevelopment committee and of the Board of Commissioners for the 
city's Community Redevelopment Agency violated the state's open meeting laws. 
</P>
<P>
 In both November meetings, the panels said they held private sessions to 
discuss a plan to lift a spending limit on the city's redevelopment project for 
the central business district. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardi contends that the closed-door sessions violated the Ralph M. Brown 
Open Meetings Act, which requires all government meetings -- with few 
exceptions -- be held in public. One exception allows private meetings when to 
discuss pending litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardi said no litigation was pending and therefore the meetings were 
illegal. To defend against the suit, the City Council's Housing and Community 
Redevelopment Committee recommended that the city hire the law firm of Kane, 
Ballmer & Berkman for a contract not to exceed $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The law firm was also hired to petition a judge to allow the city to lift the 
current $750-million spending cap for the redevelopment project. A judge must 
approve the limit adjustment because the limit was set under a court-approved 
agreement. HUGO MARTIN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; 1ST TRAIN LEAVES NEW METROLINK STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The maiden journey of the first Metrolink commuter train from Northridge took 
place without a hitch Monday, with commuters climbing stairs that still smelled 
of fresh plywood to wait under a canvas awning for morning trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink employees said about 100 people boarded the train at the new 
platform, which abuts equipment yards owned by the city Department of Water and 
Power at the corner of Wilbur Avenue and Parthenia Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Most passengers appeared to be going downtown. A few, who had boarded in 
outlying areas such as Moorpark and Camarillo, got off in Northridge and took 
shuttles to Cal State Northridge, Metrolink officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new stop in Northridge is one of seven emergency stops added to Metrolink 
lines since the Jan. 17 earthquake to help ease commutes, said Metrolink 
spokesman Peter Hidalgo. The Federal Emergency Management Agency provided an 
emergency $63-million grant to pay for the expansion of the Metrolink system 
after the quake damaged several freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge stop is on the Ventura County Metrolink line. Also opening 
Monday was the line's current terminus at Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Northridge and Camarillo stops are the last of the new emergency 
platforms to open. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo said that it was too early to determine whether the number of people 
riding the line had increased due to the new stations. But he said that since 
the earthquake, the number of passengers on the line has increased from 2,300 
to about 3,000 per day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge station will serve commuters in that area for the next 12 
months, said Hidalgo. After that, its fate will depend on how heavily it's 
used, and whether local funds are available to continue operating it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the quake, Metrolink usage increased by about 33% systemwide, said 
Hidalgo. The greatest increase was on the Santa Clarita line, where usage 
increased 21-fold immediately after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who rode the train from Northridge on Monday were a mixed bunch. Some 
were regular Metrolink riders who normally catch the train in Chatsworth. 
Others were new riders, who said the new station prompted them to give the 
trains a try. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Eyster, a Northridge retiree who travels to Downtown Los Angeles for fun 
several times a month, came to look the new station over. Eyster said she 
normally travels about four miles from her home to Chatsworth. The Northridge 
stop, by contrast, lies less than a mile from home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea they were going to do this, it's so close to the Chatsworth 
station," she said. "Suits me, though." JILL LEOVY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; CSUN STUDENTS LAUNCH FUND TO HELP BUY BOOKS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cal State Northridge student government has stepped in to provide 
earthquake aid that relief agencies can't. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN Associated Students have created an emergency fund to help students to 
buy books for this semester.The move followed a special post-earthquake meeting 
to discuss the needs of students, many of whom were impoverished or displaced 
by the Jan. 17 earthquake, Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the works is a housing database that the student government is 
compiling to help homeless students find new homes near campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Student leaders wanted to provide aid that would be specific to CSUN students, 
whose two biggest needs are for books and apartments, said Rodney Lazar, vice 
president of CSUN Associated Students. "Books are one of those things no one is 
even thinking of now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, about $20,000 has been pledged for the book fund from student 
government organizations at other Cal State campuses. CSUN Associated Students 
has committed an additional $5,000 from its own coffers and will match any new 
contributions. The organization is soliciting donations to boost the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Only students who can show financial hardship will be eligible, Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Associated Students began compiling listings of housing 
available within a three-mile radius of the campus after the college 
switchboard received a spate of calls from landlords offering housing. More 
than 100 locations are now listed on computer printouts posted in the student 
union building.

MAN'S BODY FOUND IN DRIVEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman on her way to work discovered the body of a 47-year-old Canoga Park 
man in a driveway next to an abandoned parking lot early Monday morning, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of Bartolo Oronia, a Mexican national who police said had returned to 
Southern California last week after living in Mexico for a year, was found 
about 9:45 a.m. in the 7800 block of Deering Avenue with a gunshot wound in his 
back, said Detective Rick Swanston of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have determined that Oronia was shot at another location before 
his body was dumped in the driveway. Oronia, who lived with relatives, was an 
unemployed laborer, and no motive has been established for his death, Swanston 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oronia's death was the second slaying in a 12-hour period in the area covered 
by the West Valley station, Swanston said. Those incidents were the first two 
killings of the year in that division, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are asking anyone with information about Oronia's death to contact 
detectives at the West Valley station at 989-8546 during regular business 
hours. Call the LAPD's detective headquarters downtown at (213) 485-2504 after 
business hours or on weekends.

EFFORTS TO SAVE CANINE QUAKE VICTIM FAIL; AFTERMATH: DESPITE BEING AIRLIFTED 
FOR DIALYSIS AT UC DAVIS, BIMBO THE GERMAN SHEPHERD DIES OF HER SEVERE BURNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The top-of-the-line treatment she got failed to save Bimbo. 
</P>
<P>
 Bimbo was the German shepherd severely burned when her master's truck was 
enveloped in a fireball from a ruptured natural gas line in Granada Hills 
shortly after the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite being airlifted to UC Davis for dialysis -- which she needed because 
burns over 50% of her body caused kidney failure -- and an offer of skin grafts 
at the prestigious Sherman Oaks Hospital burn center, Bimbo died Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterinarians at UC Davis, which has the state's only facility for dog 
dialysis, said the 2-year-old shepherd's condition began to deteriorate late 
Friday, prompting them to begin treatment Saturday afternoon. She improved 
briefly the next morning, but her heart failed at 12:30 p.m., they said. 
</P>
<P>
 A university news release said she probably died of a blood clotting disorder 
common to burn patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave it the college try," said Dr. A. Robert Grossman, head of the Sherman 
Oaks Hospital's burn ward, who helped coordinate the dog's care and had offered 
to perform free skin grafts on Bimbo himself. "I don't know if we would have 
had any better chances with a human." 
</P>
<P>
 Bimbo and another dog, Shep, were riding in the bed of a pickup truck driven 
by their master, Jim Menzi, a Simi Valley mechanic, a few hours after the 
quake. The truck stalled in a cloud of gas from the broken main under Rinaldi 
Street and Balboa Boulevard, and when he tried to restart the engine, flames 
engulfed him and the two dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Shep was killed, but the badly burned Menzi and Bimbo leaped into a pool of 
water escaping from a broken fire hydrant. Menzi, who was trying to get to 
Santa Clarita to check on his mother, continued on foot. Bimbo turned up at a 
shelter for earthquake victims, where Menzi's name and phone number were found 
on her collar. 
</P>
<P>
 Menzi was hospitalized for several days after the accident with burns over 30% 
of his body but was released a few weeks ago. He is in good condition and will 
not need skin grafts, his physician, Dr. Daryl Carpenter, said Monday.

2 CHARGED IN WESTLAKE HIGH SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County prosecutors Monday charged an Orange County teen-ager with 
shooting two Westlake High School students in a brawl near the campus two weeks 
ago, authorities said. They also charged a Los Angeles County teen-ager as an 
accomplice in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The two youths are the third and fourth 16-year-olds charged in the case, 
which shocked Thousand Oaks. Last week, two Westlake High School students were 
charged in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges against all four boys stem from a brawl that erupted earlier this 
month when one of the defendants and a school football player met for a 
fistfight at North Ranch Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants and others jumped out of a car and announced, "We're the Asian 
Mafia," police and witnesses say. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants -- all Asian Americans -- then attacked students with bats and 
lumber before shooting into the crowd, investigators said. Three students were 
shot, and others were beaten. All of the injured students have been released 
from local hospitals, including one who suffered a minor skull fracture caused 
by a bullet that lodged in his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. John A. Cardoza said his office will file a petition asking 
that the two teen-agers charged Monday be tried as adults. He has already filed 
a similar motion for the two Ventura County youths. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants from Orange and Los Angeles counties are being held in Juvenile 
Hall and are scheduled to be arraigned in Juvenile Court this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoza said no other arrests are imminent, but that the police investigation 
into the incident is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 He credited Ventura County sheriff's authorities for tracking down leads in 
the case in three counties and swiftly arresting the four suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sheriff's office did a heck of a job putting a lot of information 
together in a short period of time," Cardoza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have said the Asian Mafia is believed to be the name of the Los 
Angeles County gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement sources said Monday, however, that none of the four boys 
charged in the melee is believed to be an active gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoza said the Orange County youth, who is from Brea, shot two of the 
students. He is charged with two counts of assault with a firearm, including 
special allegations that he caused great bodily injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County youth, from Rowland Heights, is charged with two counts 
of assault with a firearm and one count of assault with a deadly weapon. The 
firearm charges were filed because the boy assisted in the attack, Cardoza 
said. The third charge was filed because he used a weapon -- either a stick or 
a club -- to attack a member of the crowd, Cardoza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arraignments for the two Ventura County youths were continued until Thursday. 
A defense attorney for one of the boys has said his client took part in the 
assault because he had been racially and physically harassed by a member of the 
Westlake High football team. 
</P>
<P>
 The football player, who was hit with a bat or a piece of wood during the 
attack, denied the attorney's charges.

AHMANSON RANCH FOES GET AN AUDIENCE TODAY; COURTS: THE PLAINTIFFS ARE SEEKING 
TO OVERTURN VENTURA COUNTY'S 1992 APPROVAL OF THE PROJECT NEAR SIMI VALLEY. A 
KEY ISSUE INVOLVES PARKLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Opponents of the $1-billion Ahmanson Ranch project -- which would create a 
mini-city in the rolling hills south of Simi Valley -- will get their day in 
court today. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Superior Court Judge Barbara Lane will hear oral arguments on 
nine lawsuits filed by Los Angeles County and the cities of Los Angeles, 
Calabasas, Malibu, and several environmental and homeowner groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs are seeking to overturn Ventura County's 1992 approval of the 
project, arguing that the development would cause enormous environmental 
damage, snarl traffic and strain public services in the neighboring 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the central issues in the case is whether 10,000 acres of dedicated 
parkland included in the Ahmanson deal outweigh the project's environmental 
impacts. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't know how much it's going to cost the city of Los Angeles to 
mitigate all of the traffic impacts, then how can you say the parkland is an 
overriding consideration?" said attorney Rosemary Woodblock, who is 
representing the environmental group Save Open Space. "You have to know 
specifically what you're overriding." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, said that whatever the outcome, the case will probably be 
appealed. The conservancy hopes to acquire thousands of acres of parkland in 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless there is some kind of side agreement in the appellate process, it 
could end up in the California Supreme Court," Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Supervisors approved the 3,050-dwelling golf 
course community near the Los Angeles County line on the condition that 
Ahmanson Land Co. and its partners turn over to state and federal park agencies 
10,000 acres of mountain land, much of it owned by entertainer Bob Hope. So 
far, only about 3,000 acres -- including Hope's 2,308-acre Jordan Ranch -- have 
been acquired as public parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson expects to donate another 2,633 acres, and it must still deliver two 
other Hope properties -- the 4,369-acre Runkle Ranch northwest of Chatsworth 
and the 339-acre Corral Canyon tract in Malibu -- to complete the deal. Under 
its agreement with the county, the developer has about two years remaining to 
acquire Hope's land if it wants to go forward with its development. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson, concerned how its profit margin from the planned development will be 
affected by the lawsuits, has put its plans on hold until the case is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston said he is concerned that the lawsuits may prompt Ahmanson to try to 
back out of its original development-for-parkland deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty years from now, nobody will give a damn if there are another 500 or 
1,000 extra cars" on the Ventura Freeway and surrounding surface streets, he 
said. "But they will care if we lose this opportunity to gain thousands of 
acres of parkland." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria K. VanderKolk, the county official closest to the deal, said 
she is confident that the judge will find that the environmental impact report 
on the planned development meets all state and county regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think she will rescind" the board's approval of the report, 
VanderKolk said. "It's certainly possible, but I don't think very likely." 
</P>
<P>
 If the judge finds no major problems with the report, VanderKolk said she 
believes that the Ahmanson project will go forward as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 But should there be any drastic changes to the Ahmanson development resulting 
from the court's ruling, "then the entire economic plan and development of the 
project will be completely blown away and we'll have to start all over again," 
she said.

VALLEY INTERVIEW: INTERNAL RIFT DEEPLY DIVIDES BATTERED LAPD, EX-OFFICER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chip Johnson , Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In mid-January, police union officials blamed poor morale, notably the fear of 
discipline and prosecution among officers, for a decline in the number of 
traffic citations and drunk-driving arrests by the Los Angeles Police 
Department. Police officials disputed that conclusion, but a city councilman 
called for a "summit" meeting of city and community leaders to investigate 
police morale. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Meter, who was a Los Angeles police officer for 36 years before 
retiring in June, discussed morale last week with Times staff writer Chip 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Meter worked as a patrol sergeant, watch commander and detective at divisions 
all over the city under officers including future Chiefs Tom Bradley and Darryl 
Gates. He suffered three concussions in the line of duty, one of them from a 
beating, but kept his desire to be a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Did things change after Rodney King? Did the police feel as if they 
were made to bear the brunt of the stigma caused by the officers involved in 
the beating?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Absolutely. I can truthfully say that in my 36 years never, never did 
I dream that one incident was going to cause the havoc that it did. I was at 
Van Nuys when the Rodney King thing went down, and when I heard from the other 
officers about the video, I thought to myself, "Nah, can't be that bad. These 
guys are exaggerating." I saw the video and I could not, in any way, shape or 
form, believe what I was seeing. I mean I could not believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did things change after that? And how did police officers react to the 
change?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The officers were divided on whether or not King should have received the 
punishment that he did. There was no one in the middle. You either had them 
saying no, it shouldn't have gone that far, and others who said he was on drugs 
and you can't second-guess, they were there, and all of that business. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened immediately after that thing went down was that you had all of 
this public pressure on the department. Now, the captains in these various 
patrol divisions, management-type levels, naturally they are captains because 
they have the drive to climb the ladder. They are ambitious people. When that 
thing went down, the division where I worked, Van Nuys, people in that capacity 
were going to show: "I am a firm administrator, and when you do anything a 
little bit out of line, I'm going to nail you for everything there is." So now 
what happens, as an example, in Van Nuys maybe we had about five or six 
complaints going at one time. That would have been about right. These were 
either complaints by the public or complaints made by sergeants. We went from 
this six or seven all the way to the 40s, and once into the low 50s. Instead of 
someone from administration taking a look at why Van Nuys was having such a 
problem compared to everyone else in the city, their attitude was, "We're going 
to be firm. We're going to nail these officers whether it's good, bad or 
indifferent." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How far did this policy go?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Let me give you an example of how far things got out of line and why the 
officers' morale was affected. We had a man that was arrested for a warrant. It 
was a $1,200 warrant and he said, "I want to talk to the watch commander." So, 
fine. I'm the watch commander and I go out and say, "Yeah, I understand you 
want to talk to me." He says, "I do some informing for your people from 
narcotics." "That's nice, how can I help you?" "Well," he said, "I don't think 
I should get booked for the warrant." I told him, "A judge has demanded that 
you be arrested. We have you in custody, and I can't help you. If you want to 
call the people from narcotics and arrange it, I have no problem with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he tells me right in front of the two arresting officers, "If you don't 
let me go, I'm going to say that these two officers took money from me." Is 
that right? Book him. The following day, even though I had logged that this guy 
threatened to frame the officers, he came in and my captain told me to take the 
complaint. This is the type of thing that sent these officers in a spiral 
downwards. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Isn't that an unusual occurrence?  
</P>
<P>
 A: In the aftermath of the Rodney King incident, we had the managers of the 
department running scared. They wanted to show that they were hard-nosed-type 
people and therefore were taking a complaint that in the eyes of patrol 
supervisors should never have been taken. So, now officers were not only 
catching hell from the public for something that they didn't do, but at the 
same time they were not getting any support from the managers. They were in a 
totally no-win type of thing, and that started that downward spiral. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Was it incidents like that that made you decide to leave the department?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Slowly. I always based my retirement on two things: my health and my 
attitude toward the department, and I always loved my job. But it was coupled 
with the riots, which is another extremely sore spot with me and all 
supervisors who are street-patrol people. When that thing went down, you had 
these managers, but the officers out there didn't need managers. They needed 
leaders, and the leadership came from the sergeants and the lieutenants but not 
from the captains, commanders and deputy chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has the department , since the riots, been able to heal that rift?  
</P>
<P>
 A: That's still a deep rift. It's still a deep rift because our officers have 
very little confidence in management.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do officers still feel unappreciated by the public?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yeah, but that's changing. That will heal a lot faster than their lack of 
confidence in our management-type people. That's going to be the biggest thing 
for the department to change and the biggest wound to heal. The other one will 
come slowly and, I'm sure, in time. But as far as these officers having 
confidence and wanting to be led by our managers, that is going to take a long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do career ambitions affect a manager's ability to support and represent 
the men and women under them?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Once they finally arrive in that spot, they don't want to do anything that 
will cause waves. I heard a captain tell Chief Ed Davis, "Commander, I think 
you're full of crap on this decision," and Davis backed down. That would never 
happen now. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do the rank and file confide in their captains about anything?  
</P>
<P>
 A: They will confide in them if they trust them. Supervisors are very 
standoffish. And when we questioned things at supervisors' meetings, we were 
labeled cowboys because we wouldn't go along with the party line. We were 
supposed to sit there, listen to all this stuff, not argue about it, accept it, 
just like a little puppy dog -- yes boss, yes boss, yes boss. If we do that, 
captains aren't hearing the bottom line about how things are really going, 
because they don't want to hear it, we don't want to tell them because we're 
going to be labeled cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What about a rookie and his idealistic notions about what the department is 
like. Have you seen people who've become disillusioned quickly?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. Recently, and the department doesn't like to hear this, we have 
officers who were street-oriented people that did not want this business about 
hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil, and they went off into other 
departments or head to other cities like Escondido and places like that. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the difference between the recruits then and now?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Out of about 30 people in my academy class, 27 of them had been in the 
(military) service. So we knew how to take orders. When we were told something, 
no one ever asked why. These people also had a burning desire to be police 
officers. They didn't care about the pay or the benefits. They wanted it for 
whatever reasons they had, but it meant a lot to them. As the years went by, 
you started getting less and less ex-servicemen, so things got questioned more. 
Your officers now, they're better educated than we were. 
</P>
<P>
 But the big difference is that with my era, it wasn't a job, it was something 
that we were proud of, something we wanted with our heart and soul. Now what 
you get is this: It's good pay, good benefits, and it beats doing whatever it 
was they were doing, and so they decide to become Los Angeles Police Department 
officers. To a lot of people coming on today, it's just a job. You put in eight 
hours. You respond to the radio, do everything you have to do. But it's hear, 
see and speak no evil. If I just pay attention to the radio and I don't stop 
people on the streets because here's maybe a guy selling narcotics, then I'm 
not going to get any kind of complaint or anything, so therefore I'm going to 
put in my time, do what I have to do. As far taking pride in making arrests and 
doing all of the other things go, that has changed.

U.S. PROSECUTORS WILL ACCEPT INSANITY PLEA IN BANK HEISTS; CRIME: GILBERT 
MICHAELS AVOIDS JURY TRIAL ON 18 COUNTS OF ROBBERY. HE WILL LIKELY BE HELD AT A 
MENTAL INSTITUTION UNTIL HE RECOVERS.

<P>
 Conceding that a North Hills man was insane when he stole nearly $1 million 
from nine San Fernando Valley banks, federal prosecutors announced Monday that 
they will accept a defense plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert Michaels, 51, had been scheduled to stand trial March 8 in U. S. 
District Court in Los Angeles. Prosecutors and defense attorneys, however, 
staved off a jury trial by reaching an agreement stipulating that Michaels 
committed the robberies, but that he was insane at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been evaluated by a number of psychiatrists and everybody is of the 
opinion that he was insane when he committed the robberies," Assistant U. S. 
Atty. Christopher Tayback said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michaels was indicted along with James Ambrose McGrath on 18 counts of bank 
robbery with firearms violations. A federal court jury convicted McGrath on all 
counts in October and he was subsequently sentenced to 30 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by prosecutors in the Michaels case to accept the defense's 
insanity claim pleased Timothy Lannen, an attorney representing Michaels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our extensive psychiatric diagnosis regarding Mr. Michaels indicated that he 
suffered from a mental condition so severe it rendered him unable to understand 
the difference between right and wrong," Lannen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently the government could not rebut that diagnosis." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the judge presiding over the case renders a verdict of not guilty by 
reason of insanity, Michaels will most likely be held at a mental institution 
until he recovers, Lannen said. A hearing to determine Michaels' current mental 
state has been scheduled for Feb. 22.

COOPERATION AMONG CITY AGENCIES IS URGED; GOVERNMENT: COUNCIL PANEL CALLS FOR 
NEW POLICIES IN REACTION TO DWP'S REFUSAL TO HELP POLICE IN INSURANCE-FRAUD 
INVESTIGATION. 
</P>

<P>
 Responding to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power's refusal to help 
police in an insurance-fraud investigation, a City Council panel Monday called 
for new policies to improve cooperation among city agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The call for increased cooperation was in response to a November police 
investigation of a Cadillac that police believed had been buried under tons of 
tree clippings in Pacoima as part of a scam to collect insurance money. 
</P>
<P>
 Working on a tip that the 1988 Cadillac Allante convertible was hidden in a 2 
1/2-acre wood pile behind a Pacoima wood-grinding business, investigators with 
the Los Angeles Police Department asked DWP workers at a nearby equipment yard 
to use their machinery to unearth the car. 
</P>
<P>
 But the DWP rejected the request, telling police to hire their own independent 
contractor for the job. The car eventually was uncovered but only with the help 
of employees and equipment from the wood-grinding business. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday's meeting of the council's Public Safety Committee, council member 
Laura Chick called the DWP's action "seriously wrong" and asked the city's 
chief legislative analyst to study ways to increase cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "One example of one agency not cooperating with another agency is one example 
too many," Chick said. 
</P>
<P>
 The analyst is expected to return to the committee with a report by March 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Moore, a DWP director, said the lack of assistance was a mistake, 
which he attributed to DWP workers' confusion about the agency's policy to help 
police.

BOMB FOUND OUTSIDE HOME OF DEPUTY D.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A homemade bomb was found Monday outside the Hollywood home of a deputy 
district attorney assigned to the Van Nuys courts, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad removed the explosive, 
described by police as "a functional device." 
</P>
<P>
 It was found by plumbers about 8:30 a.m. at the home of Richard Size, a 
veteran deputy district attorney, in the 7000 block of Hillside Avenue in the 
Hollywood Hills, said Detective Steven Spear of the Criminal Conspiracy 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosive device was found at the edge of the driveway, said Officer Don 
Cox. The plumbers studied the device for a time before using a car phone to 
contact police -- a dangerous practice with a live bomb, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get an electrical charge from the wires to the gasoline and boom," Cox 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bomb squad detonated the device, but several pieces were left intact as 
evidence, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 No suspects have been arrested and no motive is known, authorities said.

26 VYING TO REPLACE TRIO OF STATE LEGISLATORS FROM THE VALLEY; ELECTIONS: SEN. 
ROBERTI AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FRIEDMAN AND MARGOLIN ARE NOT SEEKING REELECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Twenty-six candidates -- including a peripatetic state senator, a former TV 
sitcom actress and two West Hollywood City Council members -- are running to 
replace three state legislators from the San Fernando Valley who are not 
seeking reelection this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The three seats up for grabs are now held by state Sen. David Roberti (D-Van 
Nuys), who is ineligible to seek reelection under the term-limit law; state 
Assemblyman Terry Friedman (D-Brentwood), who is retiring to seek a judgeship, 
and Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles), who is running for state 
insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday was the deadline for candidates to file for state offices in which no 
incumbents are running. The filing deadline for other seats was last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary election is June 7, the general election Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roberti seat -- situated wholly in the Valley and representing Canoga 
Park, Van Nuys, North Hollywood, Sun Valley, Pacoima, Sylmar and the city of 
San Fernando -- has attracted 10 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Most prominent is state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), a lawmaker 
who recently rented a home in Roberti's district to establish residency there. 
Opponents are already calling Rosenthal, who has long represented Westside 
constituencies, a carpetbagger. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal, 75, said last week that he was running for Roberti's seat because 
the Valley needs an experienced legislator to help get it back on its feet 
after the earthquake. But critics say Rosenthal is running for Roberti's seat 
because he stands little hope of being elected to the Eastside-based seat he 
wound up with when legislative districts were reapportioned in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The race to replace Roberti -- who has taken out nomination papers to run for 
either the State Board of Equalization or for state treasurer -- also features 
Jim Keysor, a Democrat and state assemblyman from the Valley from 1970 to 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Others in the race include three who have been involved in the April 12 
election to recall Roberti. They are Democrat William Dominguez, a systems 
analyst who led the recall coalition, and Republicans Dolores White, a real 
estate broker, and Larry Martz, a contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Running as Republicans for the Roberti seat are David Honda, a contractor, who 
ran in the 1992 special election against Roberti; Al Dib, a retired grocer who 
ran for Los Angeles City Council last year, and Randy Linkmeyer, a gun shop 
owner. Democrat Michael Del Rio is also running as is Peace and Freedom Party 
candidate Gary Kast. 
</P>
<P>
 As of the Monday deadline, eight candidates had filed for the 41st Assembly 
District seat now held by Friedman, which includes Brentwood, West Los Angeles, 
Pacific Palisades and Malibu south of the Santa Monica Mountains, and Encino, 
Tarzana, Woodland Hills, West Hills, Warner Center, Agoura Hills and Calabasas 
north of the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic candidates for the Friedman seat -- all Westsiders -- are 
attorney Bill Rothbard of Pacific Palisades who has been president of Americans 
for Non-Smokers Rights, the group that led the fight for the airline smoking 
ban; attorney Roger Diamond, a homeowner activist in the campaign during the 
1980s to block oil drilling in the Pacific Palisades by Occidental Petroleum; 
Santa Monica resident Sheila James Kuehl, an attorney who played Zelda in the 
1960s television sitcom "The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis"; attorney Edward Z. 
Tabash of Malibu, an activist in the California Abortion Rights Action League, 
and Leslie Devine, a member of the Calabasas City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Running as Republicans for the seat are Peter Eason of Calabasas, Stefan 
Stitch, a recent USC graduate, and Fred Beteta. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the candidates are from the Westside section of the 41st 
District, only 44% of the district's registered voters live on the Westside, 
the others residing in the Valley, Calabasas or Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The other open seat with a Valley constituency is in the 42nd Assembly 
District, now represented by Margolin. Although it is dominated by Westwood, 
Bel-Air, Beverly Hills, the Fairfax district, West Hollywood and Hollywood, the 
district also extends northward into Sherman Oaks and Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Vying to represent this heavily Democratic area are eight people, including 
four current office-holders seeking political promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates are two West Hollywood City Council members -- Paul Koretz and 
Abbe Land -- Los Angeles school board member Mark Slavkin, Los Angeles 
Community College board member Wally Knox; Laura Lake, a former UCLA teacher 
and Los Angeles City Council candidate; Bruce Margolin, a lawyer active with 
the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws; John Duran, a 
lawyer and gay activist, and Stephanie Van Vliet of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Other state legislative seats from the Valley up for election are: 
</P>
<P>
 * The 38th Assembly District. Incumbent Paula Boland (D-Granada Hills) will 
have no foes in the Republican primary. Also filing for the seat are Democrat 
Josh Arce of Chatsworth and Green Party member Charles Wilken. 
</P>
<P>
 * The 40th Assembly District. Incumbent Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) has filed for 
reelection. In the primary, Katz will face Ollie McCaulley of Panorama City. 
Also running are Republican Nicholas Fitzgerald and Peace and Freedom Party 
member Gene Mooney. 
</P>
<P>
 * The 41st Assembly District. Incumbent Barbara Friedman (D-Van Nuys) will 
face Democrat Frank Real in the primary. Also running are Republican Noel 
DeGaetano, Libertarian Kelley L. Ross and Peace and Freedom Party member Marcia 
Silverstein. 
</P>
<P>
 * The 43rd Assembly District. Incumbent Pat Nolan (R-Glendale), who is under 
indictment on political corruption charges, will be challenged by three 
Republicans in the primary -- Mathhew Collins of Burbank, Taryn McNatt-Lorimer 
of North Hollywood and Peter Repovich of North Hollywood, a Los Angeles police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Running as Democrats for the 43rd District seat are Adam Schiff, a former U. 
S. attorney, and Ken Kulpa, a community activist. Libertarian Willard Michlin 
is also a candidate.

FASHION MINUS A SAFETY PLUS; LEGISLATION: RESPONDING TO A NEW STATE LAW, 
STUDENTS SAY THEY OBJECT TO THE WAY BIKE HELMETS LOOK. OTHERS ADMIT THAT THE 
REQUIREMENT WILL PROTECT THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Youngsters don't usually pay much attention when new laws go into effect, even 
to one that has a significant impact on their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of them are aware of the state law that took effect the first of the 
year. In fact, the law weighed on their minds -- literally. 
</P>
<P>
 Youngsters interviewed at three San Gabriel Valley elementary schools were 
familiar with the new requirement that they wear bicycle helmets until the age 
of 18. Their responses were divided between those who considered the law a good 
idea and those who, to put it mildly, did not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate it!" said Andrew Yamada, 10. The fifth-grader at Baldwin Stocker 
School in Arcadia was, nonetheless, wearing a helmet as he parked his bike 
before school. The helmet clashed with way he likes to look, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow students who oppose the law were equally as vocal, and most were 
concerned about how the helmets look. 
</P>
<P>
 "The helmet makes me feel like I'm Einstein, 'cause I have such a big head," 
said Alex Armstrong, 10, a fourth-grader at Mayflower School in Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who agreed that the law is a good one said they felt a little funny 
wearing a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's good for our safety," said Domini Possemato, 10, who attends 
Baldwin Stocker. But wearing a helmet is "kind of embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Lanza, 12, a sixth-grader at Coolidge School in San Gabriel, agreed 
about safety. "Everyone is going to look a little weird. But that's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three schools where students were interviewed, Coolidge had the most 
active helmet promotion program. It held a helmet sale last year and even 
donated some helmets to families that couldn't afford them. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety was the main reason students supported the law. "It's pretty good 
because if a car hits you and you splatter against the windshield, it won't 
hurt you so much," said Chris Beebe, 11, a Baldwin Stocker sixth-grader. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Mahaffey, age 11 and a Coolidge sixth-grader, has a personal reason for 
supporting the law. His friend suffered three concussions riding a bike without 
a helmet. "Now, his parents won't let him out of the house without it," Matt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Van Wye, 10, a Mayflower fourth-grader and a vocal opponent of the law, 
said the safety issue was overrated. "I know you can get hurt, but most people 
don't, and most people don't wear helmets, and they're going to get too many 
unnecessary tickets," he said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 3RD COMMUTER BUS ROUTE TO SERVE AS LINK 
BETWEEN VALLEYS; TRANSPORTATION: THE NEW LINE WILL MAKE 32 ROUND TRIPS EACH 
WEEKDAY BETWEEN SANTA CLARITA AND MAJOR EMPLOYMENT CENTERS IN VAN NUYS.

<P>
 In a move designed to get more motorists off the freeways, city transportation 
officials announced Monday that a third commuter bus route will soon link the 
Santa Clarita and San Fernando valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Wednesday, Line 798 will make 32 round trips each weekday between 
Santa Clarita and major employment centers in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Faculty, staff and students at Cal State Northridge, which began classes 
Monday, can also use the line, which is linked to the campus by an MTA bus 
route. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the city transit authority launched two additional routes serving 
businesses in Chatsworth and Warner Center in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 All three new routes are aimed at commuters traveling to areas in the San 
Fernando Valley west of the San Diego Freeway, said Ron Kilcoyne, the city's 
transit manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically we're finding that Metrolink is not really a viable option for 
those people," Kilcoyne said. "So we're trying to give them an alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 Kilcoyne said although ridership was scant in the beginning days of the 
Chatsworth and Warner Center routes, it is steadily increasing and is expected 
to continue to grow as more businesses open in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
 He said service is expected to continue until repairs are completed on the 
quake-damaged Antelope Valley and Golden State freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the three routes -- estimated at $200,000 a month -- is expected 
to be reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Nuys line, which connects with about 20 MTA bus routes traveling 
throughout the San Fernando Valley, runs every half an hour. The Warner Center 
and Chatsworth routes have three early morning departures from Santa Clarita 
and three afternoon return trips from the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 A one-way ticket on each of the three lines is $2. Monthly commuter passes are 
$65. For details on routes or schedules or other information call Santa Clarita 
Transit at (805) 294-1287.

 "Quit India!" 
</P>
<P>
 More than half a century ago, with the Japanese army advancing toward the 
Indian frontier and seemingly unstoppable, Mohandas K. Gandhi, the "Great 
Soul," launched the call for the British to leave his country, immediately and 
unconditionally. His target was the injustice and humiliation of colonialism. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a coalition of alarmed Indian socialists has dusted off his slogan and his 
tactics of nonviolent protest to battle a more recent foreign foe: 
"cola-onalism," the fizzy, ubiquitous drinks made by Coca-Cola and Pepsi. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the two most aggressive agencies of pushing in what I consider 
American culture. That includes a lot of things, from junk food to Madonna to 
Michael Jackson," said George Fernandes, a former minister, labor organizer and 
leader of the Janata Dal party. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the soft-drink giants leave India voluntarily by the month's end, 
starting March 1 their bottling plants and retail outlets will be picketed and 
trucks carrying their products will be blocked, Fernandes announced on behalf 
of Samajwadi Abhiyan, an umbrella alliance of socialists. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandes, responsible for driving Coke out of the Indian market in 1977 (Coke 
returned last fall), claimed that movement organizers can count on the support 
of 200,000 nationalist students in universities in the New Delhi area, as well 
as "millions" worried that jobs in Indian enterprises are in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Those forecasts seem preposterous. 
</P>
<P>
 But regardless of how many people lie down in front of delivery vans or agree 
to boycott Coke and Pepsi, the "quit India" campaign, freighted with the 
symbols and strategy of the fight against imperialism, is a reminder of how 
touchy some Indian leaders and intellectuals still are about foreign 
penetration of their once nearly hermetically sealed economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world has changed in 50 years,"' objected P. M. Sinha, managing director 
of Pepsi Foods Ltd., who claims that Fernandes and his backers just haven't 
kept up. "The country today exists in a new environment of global integration." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepsi, he said, will stand pat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quit India" redux may be one of the last gasps of the ideal of a 
self-sufficient, import-free India minted in the heyday of Gandhi and 
Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last year, a new, more open India attracted more foreign investment 
than during the whole of the 1980s. American, as well as European and Japanese, 
companies are arriving en masse. Many will watch the anti-cola campaign to see 
whether the old slogans have any life left. 
</P>
<P>
 The experiences of Cargill, the U.S. grain-trading dynasty, indicate that, at 
least in some economic sectors or regions, foreigners may be in for a bumpy 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
 The Minneapolis-based company, one of America's largest privately held 
corporations, sells hybrid sunflower and corn seed in India; in December, 1992, 
hundreds of militants attacked its office in Bangalore, looted the seedlings 
and computer records and tossed them in a bonfire outside, said Cargill's India 
general manager, Raza Hasnain. Last July, a mob was back, laying waste to 
sections of a seed-processing plant under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Cargill was targeted because of a provision in the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade, then being debated, that allowed the patenting of new 
strains of seeds. Fernandes warned at the time that multinationals like Cargill 
"will hook farmers to their products, then raise prices. In the process, our 
agricultural base will collapse." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the destruction, Cargill says that it still intends to do business in 
India. "Neither attack has deterred us from our initial intentions: We're here 
to serve the Indian farmer," said Hasnain, whose office is now guarded by a 
security agent armed with a double-barreled shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandes, who also tangled with Cargill over its proposal to create a giant 
coastal salt farm, says his concerns are economic. In an interview in the 
white-washed Delhi bungalow that serves as his command post, the bespectacled 
lawmaker claimed that over the next three years, Coke and Pepsi combined would 
siphon almost half a billion dollars in royalties and profits out of India. 
That sum, he said, would be enough to pay for the construction of 600 miles of 
broad-gauge railroad and to employ 30,000 people to run it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a country where four-fifths of the villages are without potable 
drinking water," Fernandes said. "The law of the market cannot be allowed to 
operate." 
</P>
<P>
 Although his party's clout has waned, Fernandes knows that soft-drink 
companies pay attention when he speaks. As minister of industry in the Janata 
Dal government in 1977, he demanded that Coca-Cola turn over a majority share 
of its holdings and reveal its secret formula if it wanted to continue doing 
business in India. Instead, Coke left. 
</P>
<P>
 The world's most popular soft drink returned to the Indian market last 
October, opening a bottling plant in a dusty little industrial town near Agra, 
site of the fabled Taj Mahal. That, and the Coke garden umbrellas that have 
sprouted in eateries near the Taj, is an unmistakable sign that the country 
that had battled imports to the point of developing domestic alternatives to 
Coke -- Campa Cola and Thums Up -- has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 To secure a launch pad in the Indian market, Coke entered into a $70-million 
"strategic alliance" with the maker of Thums Up, an Indian drinks manufacturer 
named Parle that boasted a 60% market share. Business insiders say the deal is 
a barely disguised takeover by Coke. Pepsi, meanwhile, has seized 24% of 
India's cola trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepsi naturally rejects the socialists' line of reasoning and arithmetic. It 
entered the Indian market three years ago, subject to a raft of government 
restrictions (including the addition of the Hindi word for wave, lehar, to its 
brand name). Its executives say that far from sucking money out of India, they 
are enriching it. 
</P>
<P>
 "In three years, we have grown to be one of the largest exporters; in the next 
five years, we should be one of the top five," said Sinha, the Pepsi manager. 
"As of today, we have almost brought in $50 million in foreign exchange. I 
don't think that in the next 10 years a single cent will go out of this 
country. We are now in an investment phase." 
</P>
<P>
 In Madras, Pepsi is building a $27-million plant to manufacture plastic 
bottles. The company just received a $20-million order to ship returnable glass 
bottles to the Persian Gulf. Pepsi also plans to open Kentucky Fried Chicken 
and Pizza Hut restaurants, thereby creating more Indian jobs, Sinha said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cola merchants look upon India with unconcealed ambition because of its 
growth potential. Soft-drink consumption averages a paltry three bottles per 
capita each year, compared to a reported 750 in the United States and more than 
1,100 in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandes says that India already has its own colas and that foreign 
concoctions are really no different, so India isn't getting any advanced 
foreign technology in return for permitting market access. 
</P>
<P>
 In a larger sense, he is concerned about India as it exists today -- a country 
where vast private wealth and 60% illiteracy and widespread poverty coexist. 
"Unless there is a return to Gandhi, we are lost," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Fernandes and his followers dusted off another Gandhian action -- 
the famed "salt march" staged by the Indian nationalist in 1930 to protest the 
British government monopoly on salt -- and used it against another Cargill 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on whom one listens to, the campaign worked, or it didn't. Cargill 
wanted to build a salt works in the Gujarati port of Kandla and promised the 
Indian government to export its entire 1-million ton annual output of 
industrial salt. The government gave its approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their plant would have meant massive unemployment in the salt sector, where 
150,000 Indians are employed," Fernandes claimed, disputing Cargill's 
contention that it would not produce for the domestic market. He launched a 
civil disobedience movement he says mobilized 20,000 people in Uttar Pradesh 
state alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasnain acknowledges that Fernandes did slow the project. But there were other 
factors, he said, including suspicions by some Indians of CIA involvement. The 
clincher proved to be the economic downturn experienced by Japan, the plant's 
target market. When it became clear that Japan wouldn't be able to absorb an 
additional million tons of industrial salt, Hasnain said, Cargill shelved the 
idea, at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Pondering the arguments of socialists like Fernandes, India-born Hasnain 
rejects them as having failed miserably. "Our umbilical cord always was to the 
Soviet Union. We regarded foreign investment as an enemy. And look where we are 
today," the Cargill executive said. "In 1960, South Korea and India had the 
same gross domestic product per capita. Today, South Korea's is 10 times 
higher."
