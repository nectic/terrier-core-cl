 On Friday, Inglewood will begin stricter enforcement of curfew for the city's 
8,000 youths under age 18. It will apply to teens out after 10 p.m. on 
weeknights, 11 p.m. on weekends, who are not accompanied by an adult , on 
errands for their parents or returning home from a job, educational or 
recreational activity. Curfew-breakers will be detained in the lobby of the 
police station, where they will be fingerprinted and supervised by trained 
volunteers until parents arrive. Here's what some Inglewood students think of 
the plan. ALICIA WILLIAMS 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I feel that the curfew is a good idea to reduce crime. It may also assist 
those parents who are having a difficult time disciplining their children. 
Maybe teen-agers who don't listen to their parents may listen to the law, 
especially if there is a penalty. In time, repeat offenders may catch on. DAWED 
EWELL 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore, Inglewood High School 
</P>
<P>
 What really upsets me about the curfew is that it sends out the wrong message 
-- that a predominantly African American- and Latino-populated city can't 
conduct itself properly so its youths need to be put on an 8-inch leash. IRMA 
FRANCO  
</P>
<P>
 Senior, Morningside High School 
</P>
<P>
 Some people say that the curfew is a violation of their rights; others say it 
is enslavement. But I think they are just making up excuses. After all, there 
is no reason for hanging out on a corner with friends. The curfew does not 
prohibit friends from talking indoors. BRANDON BAKER 
</P>
<P>
 Seventh grader, Crozier Middle School 
</P>
<P>
 The curfew is good because it might prevent a lot of drive-bys and other forms 
of violence. Some kids say that the curfew takes away their freedom, but I 
don't think so. The issue isn't freedom, it's safety. GREGORY FREEMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, Inglewood High 
</P>
<P>
 I am apathetic about the curfew. Whether I like the curfew or not, it will 
still go into effect. But I am not going to adjust my lifestyle for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't get me wrong. I am no incorrigible. Far from it. I am a member of a home 
where high moral, ethical and religious values are constantly stressed. I am 
valedictorian of my class. But I have been taught to think for myself. I 
strongly feel that this curfew violates my freedom. Who, except my parents, 
should say when I have to be inside? And what do the politicians really gain 
from the curfew? Reelection, of course. MANDISA REMER 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, Inglewood High 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few weeks ago, we mourned the deaths of three of our alumni. When will 
the violence end? Anyone under age 18 shouldn't be outside the house at 1 a.m. 
or 2 a.m. as so many teen-agers are. That's why I support the curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the curfew to work, we as individuals have a responsibility in 
carrying out the law. Parents need to be more responsible by finding out what 
their children do, who they are with and what type of atmosphere they are 
exposed to. And teen-agers under 18 need to accept responsibility by obeying 
the curfew and encouraging friends to do likewise. LORISA YATES 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, Inglewood High 
</P>
<P>
 The Inglewood curfew is only a temporary solution to a permanent problem. It 
will satisfy the residents of Inglewood for a short time, but in time, teens 
will become restless and resentful. The children will soon feel more like they 
are in an institution instead of in a city. YASMIN BASKIN  
</P>
<P>
 Eighth grader, Inglewood Christian School 
</P>
<P>
 I agree with the curfew. But the city should not stop with the curfew. There 
should be after-school and weekend activities for youths. CAMEO WATKINS 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore, St. Mary's Academy 
</P>
<P>
 I think the curfew is unfair. The whole thing about being in America is 
freedom. Why should we be restricted to our houses? Parties don't start until 
after 10 p.m. The City of Inglewood should have the same rules as other cities. 
The same violence that happens here happens in other parts of the county too. 
PORTIA DANIELS 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore, Morningside High 
</P>
<P>
 A major concern for many teen-agers is whether the police will harass us, even 
if we have a legitimate reason for being out past curfew, like returning home 
from a school activity.  
</P>
<P>
 As I see things, teens may learn all the acceptable reasons to be out past 
curfew and manipulate their responses to the police. Then how effective will 
the curfew be? CESAR MARTINEZ 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, Morningside High 
</P>
<P>
 I think the curfew is an insult to all the good teen-agers because they won't 
be able to go out. I think that city officials should only put the curfew on 
those who have prior problems with the police. ADRIENNE GRIFFIN  
</P>
<P>
 Senior, Morningside High 
</P>
<P>
 I think the curfew will be ignored. There are too many teen-agers to try to 
control on weekends anyway. Curfew would just cause more problems in a system 
that already has too many problems.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: SERMON; ON HOW 
SOCIAL ACTIVISM GOES HAND IN HAND WITH SPIRITUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL KAPLAN, Earl Kaplan is rabbi of Temple Beth Israel in Pomona. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Among the greatest medieval Jewish scholars and mystics, few created a legacy 
like Rabbi Isaac ben Solomon Luria. Known to his disciples as "The Ari" -- a 
Hebrew acrostic for "The Divine Rabbi" -- Luria died in 1572 at the age of only 
38. His teachings, however, have endured. Much of The Ari's wisdom evolved 
during years of virtual solitude at Jazirat al Rawda, on the banks of the Nile 
near Cairo. Having renounced life as an Egyptian merchant, young Luria 
retreated to a simple hut by the river. There, without distractions, he sought 
a fuller understanding of the meaning of life. Through several years of 
contemplation and meditation, Luria developed a remarkable collection of 
philosophies and spiritual insights -- including the concept of tikkun olam -- 
"the repair of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Tikkun olam implies that our world is in a fragmented state. Each person must 
do everything possible to repair this damage, to bring a measure of wholeness 
(or shalom) to troubled people. Modern Jewish philosopher Rabbi Michael 
Chernick describes this process as social activism propelled by inner holiness 
and faith in God. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the world reflects the timelessness of The Ari's teaching. Fires, 
floods and earthquakes consume us. Riots and the residue from riots overwhelm 
us. People starve in Somalia, in Sarajevo, in downtown Los Angeles and around 
the globe. Decision-makers allocate millions for hockey arenas and pennies for 
HIV/AIDS research.  
</P>
<P>
 In the face of such despair, a truly spiritual person has no choice but to 
address these and other critical problems in a forthright manner. This vision 
of social activism, described by a mystical rabbi so long ago, has particular 
urgency for our own Southern California communities at a time when we seem so 
polarized and uncertain, so anxious and fearful. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent surveys show that many people are searching for greater meaning in 
their lives. They desire a closer relationship with God. Their quest for the 
spiritual has a most noble purpose but, for some, one aspect of the search 
clearly differs from tikkun olam . 
</P>
<P>
 Where Luria postulated a delicate balance between spirituality and social 
activism, some in this generation postulate spirituality with minimal social 
activism. Some seek God while simultaneously avoiding humanity.  
</P>
<P>
 Renewed interest in spirituality broadens the possibilities of growing closer 
to God, to one another and to our own best selves. Nevertheless, interest in 
spirituality must not preclude our responsibilities for social justice and 
ethical activism. When we lose the delicate balance between them, we lose 
opportunities to extend our blessings to those who lack them. When we maintain 
our delicate balance, we move ourselves closer to a better world, a better 
city, a better family, and a better quality of personal life. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Isaac Luria brought wisdom and light to the 16th Century. That wisdom 
and light would serve us well as we plan for the 21st Century, seeking renewal 
and shalom.

 There is no question that crimes by young people are a big problem. In 1992, 
the most recent year for which figures are available, juvenile homicides, 
forcible rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults climbed to their highest 
levels in the nation's history. And fear among the public is growing along with 
the statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to stem crimes by and against juveniles, Inglewood city officials 
have approved a plan for a curfew for minors under 18 that begins Friday. The 
old curfew was aimed at kids 16 or younger. Santa Monica also instituted a new 
curfew late last year. Curfews have been around for years, but they are being 
enforced more frequently as crimes by juveniles increase. 
</P>
<P>
 In Youth Opinion, kids living in Inglewood give their thoughts on what the 
city's tougher curfew means and how they will respond to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood Police Chief Oliver M. Thompson says the kids have nothing to fear 
if they have a legitimate reason for being out after the curfew. "I'm not only 
a police chief, I'm a father. I live in town. I've got a 17-year-old. He's a 
junior in high school. I've said to my son, 'I don't believe the police are 
going to be hassling you. There's a law that says you shouldn't be on the 
street at a certain time unless you're going back and forth to official 
functions,' " such as sports activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson says gang activity is part of the reason for the new law. "Our gang 
activity in many instances has gone down. But you only need one unfortunate 
situation," says the chief, referring to a 24-hour period in January in which a 
teen-age girl, a toddler and three other people were slain in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson says merchants have complained about kids loitering. "When you have a 
gang of kids loitering or wandering aimlessly, hanging out, merchants might 
say, 'Well, what's in that young person's mind?' It may not be a fear that is 
(based) in reality, but it's a perception of what might occur. And that is what 
we're dealing with." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson says there are some recreational activities for kids in Inglewood 
that would keep them off the streets at night. "Matt Robinson, the parks and 
recreation director and I are working late night basketball Tuesday and Friday 
night. If there are not enough places for kids to go, then that comes back on 
the city adults -- mothers and fathers -- to say if this really is an issue 
then we need to work together to provide a place where our young people can 
go." 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica, a new law was put into effect last September. Police Sgt. 
Gary Gallinot, the chief's adjutant, says the old ordinance was found to be 
unconstitutional because it was not specific about what constitutes loitering. 
He says the new law was enacted after the city started to experience an influx 
of juveniles from other areas in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the city tried to educate the public about the new curfew before it 
went into effect, Gallinot says. "We went out to the community, we went out to 
the schools. We talked to the kids in the schools about what curfew was and 
what it wasn't and how we were going to enforce it." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Gallinot, kids understand the curfew that is in force now "and 
for the most part are respecting it."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: PLATFORM; SMOKING IN 
THE MILITARY: 'COMPLETE BAN IS FOLLY'

 A new Pentagon policy will effectively ban smoking from all military 
workplaces when it takes effect April 8. We asked some Southern California 
current and retired military personnel their views on the subject. TOM TINDALL 
</P>
<P>
 Lieutenant colonel, U.S. Army ROTC at USC 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere I've been over the past five years, I don't think we've been 
allowed to smoke in offices. Maybe that's been local policy that's been 
reinforced by higher headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the 22 years I've been in the Army, we've gotten more and more serious 
about physical fitness in the sense that we challenge our bodies more.  
</P>
<P>
 Each year, more of even the older guys quit smoking. It's mostly a personal 
decision. There's very little overt pressure from above in the sense that a 
boss would make a derogatory comment about someone who's smoking. DOUG SAYERS 
</P>
<P>
 Public affairs officer, Naval Air Station Miramar, San Diego 
</P>
<P>
 As we understand it, it's not going to be a big deal for us. We've 
de-emphasized alcohol and tobacco consumption. You can't go in a building here 
without seeing some sort of anti-smoking poster. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of it is a natural reflection of what's going on in society. We were out 
looking for people who were smoking in designated areas outside the buildings 
and had a great deal of trouble finding any. ROBERT A. WALTER 
</P>
<P>
 Colonel, USMC, retired, Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't smoke until I was 21, when a Japanese battleship off Guadalcanal 
popped 14-inch shells into Henderson Field for two hours. I've smoked on and 
off since then.  
</P>
<P>
 I think they have to be reasonable about this type of thing. They should have 
smoking areas aboard ship or in offices away from nonsmokers, but putting a 
complete ban on it is folly. I think we're coming to a point on smoking where 
it's becoming a Big Brother thing, nothing more than social engineering. If I 
want to shorten my life expectancy by smoking, that's my business so long as I 
am not offensive or endangering other people. FERRIS COOK 
</P>
<P>
 Master sergeant, USMC, retired, Oceanside 
</P>
<P>
 I think it's good. You'd be in a little closed-in room and people would come 
in with cigarettes. I would stop the meeting and tell them: 'You've got 
non-smokers in here; either put them out or leave.' I don't smoke, but there 
were a lot of times, even though no one was smoking in my office, you would get 
the smoke anyway. It was kind of a distraction. When you go to some of those 
military functions where you have from 25 to 50 people there and at least 
one-third smoke, you could tell you'd been there because you had smoke in your 
clothes -- like going into a bar. SHERWOOD DODGE 
</P>
<P>
 Navy veteran, volunteer for the Disabled American Veterans, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 I would agree that there should be no smoking in workplaces. But I don't think 
you can just all of a sudden penalize smokers. You have to provide some place 
for me to be able to puff my brains out if that's what I want to do. And also 
have access to it. I don't think you can say, "Well, gee, you can only have 10 
minutes every four hours in which to go down and have a cigarette." In the 
everyday stress of life, especially now that we've had this earthquake and the 
freeways are shut, there are times when I just have to pull over to the side of 
the road and have a cigarette.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: CONVERSATION WITH F. 
HAYNES LINDLEY JR.; CRIME AND VIOLENCE HAVE REACHED 'CRISIS PROPORTIONS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 F. Haynes Lindley Jr. is president of the Los Angeles-based John Randolph 
Haynes and Dora Haynes Foundation, which provides funding to study social 
problems. This year, the organization will provide $1.5 million for research on 
three of society's major problems. Lindley talked to Times Staff Writer George 
White.  
</P>
<P>
 Question: What is "solutions-oriented research" and how might Los Angeles 
benefit from such a project?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Solutions-oriented research means academic research concentrating on 
solutions rather than causes -- action-oriented research that is particularly 
useful to policy-makers and others attempting to address the problems that 
confront our society. 
</P>
<P>
 Local and regional social-science issues long have been the center of 
foundation-supported research. Our goal with this program is to attract the 
best researchers to focus on solutions to three of the critical problems 
confronting the Greater Los Angeles area -- improving employment possibilities, 
curtailing crime and violence, and building community. 
</P>
<P>
 By signaling the foundation's interest in these areas, top-quality researchers 
will realize the probability of being funded if they develop good proposals for 
problem-solving projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Our organization is 67 years old. For the past 56 years, we've attempted to 
add to the knowledge and understanding of complex social issues by focusing on 
investigating and publicizing their causes.  
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, we concluded that we could have greater impact if we included 
a solutions-oriented component and become more pro-active. Accordingly, we 
developed the Solutions Research Program, adding it to our General Research 
Grant Program -- through which we will continue to fund theoretical 
social-science research. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Why did you select employment, crime and community as topics for funding? 
</P>
<P>
 A. It was an interesting culling process, which took place over a couple of 
years. These three seemed the most crucial. They kept recurring throughout our 
board and committee discussions as the Solutions Research Program was being 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtailing violence and crime is arguably the most critical difficulty we 
face. The problem has reached crisis proportions -- and continues to grow, 
threatening lives and property throughout the region. The consequences of not 
reversing the trend are grave. The challenge is to abate the activity without 
eroding the individual liberties of our free society. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally complex and extremely severe, the problems involving employment and 
the work force are having a profound impact on the region's economy and leading 
to a population that is demoralized and suffering hardship. Corporate 
downsizing, rapid population growth, a technological revolution and a labor 
pool lacking required skills are part of an intricate equation that must be 
solved if we are to avoid regional poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of community may be the central one. A significant portion of our 
population lacks any sense of common ground or common values. People at the 
margin feel isolated, politically impotent and cynical. Angelenos need to 
experience community, empowerment and its concomitant responsibility. Defining 
the appropriate public-policy response to this society-shattering alienation 
would do much to resolve many of our other major problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What kind of impact will this project have on companies and other 
foundations if you fund successful proposals? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Businesses should benefit. Reduction in crime should reduce the costs of 
doing business, while increased employment should stimulate spending. If the 
local economy is improved, new enterprises will be established and out-of-town 
concerns may be attracted to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the research we support does point to meaningful solutions which 
subsequently do influence policy, other foundations may become interested in 
seeking solutions in countless other areas.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MAKING A DIFFERENCE; 
ONE ORGANIZATION'S APPROACH: EDUCATE TO BUILD CHARACTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Agreeing on shared values, ethical conduct and how to teach them to children 
remains a challenge in a diverse society, even though sizable numbers of 
American youths admit to stealing, lying and cheating at school, work and home. 
Since 1963, the Pasadena-based Jefferson Center for Character Education has 
focused on ways to systematically teach children common values and ethical 
decision-making skills that cut across ethnic, cultural and religious lines by 
integrating them into everyday school lessons and activities. The center's 
educational materials promote as character-building values those espoused in 
the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution -- especially the 
Bill of Rights. These values include honesty, respect, responsibility, courage, 
tolerance, justice and politeness. Educators, students and parents work 
together and depend upon each other to create a schoolwide climate that 
reinforces these shared values. Administrators report that the center's 
programs improve student attendance and conduct and enrich the educational 
environment. Nearly 1.5 million students at 4,000 schools in the United States 
and Canada have used materials developed by the Jefferson Center. CHARACTER 
EDUCATION STEPS: 
</P>
<P>
 TEACH CONTENT DIRECTLY 
</P>
<P>
 Use direct teaching to connect specific, desirable values like 
"responsibility" and "respect" with explicit behaviors like being on time, 
completing homework or listening to someone talking. For example, students and 
teacher may discuss the meaning of "courage" and list the ways they can 
demonstrate the concept in the classroom. Showing courage to one group of 
students meant "being nice to kids that other kids tease." 
</P>
<P>
 EMPHASIZE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS 
</P>
<P>
 Promote a decision-making method to help students develop and use skills 
needed to make ethical choices. One approach employs the acronym "STAR" to 
remind students of the program's goal -- Success Through Accepting 
Responsibility -- and a four step process they are expected to consider when 
confronted with a conflict or problem -- Stop, Think, Act, and Review. Provide 
opportunities for students to establish a specific goal and to practice 
choosing alternatives and understanding the consequences of choices in pursuit 
of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 EXTEND SHARED CULTURE 
</P>
<P>
 Keep the concepts and behaviors promoted in class at the forefront of 
students' attention and bring them to the playground, cafeteria, bus and into 
the home and neighborhood. Use visual reinforcement like banners, murals and 
signs and parent support through regular assemblies and volunteer opportunities 
to create a wide environment of approval for conduct consistent with desired 
values and ethical decision-making and to generate positive peer approval. At 
some schools teachers use "caught being good certificates" that name students 
involved in desirable conduct and tape them wherever the incidents occur. QUOTE 
</P>
<P>
 "Character education programs help teach children that no matter where you 
come from, no matter what country you may come from, to be successful here 
there are certain steps to that success like 'be responsible,' 'be healthy,' 
'be a listener and a doer,' and those steps go hand in hand with academic 
learning in a school community."

 Respect. It's all about respect. I've made progress fighting graffiti and 
crime in our neighborhood without any weapon. Of 56 homes on our block where 
I'm the Neighborhood Watch captain, mine is one of only a handful that doesn't 
have guns, although I've had guns pulled on me many times. Instead, I confront 
people with respect. And it works. 
</P>
<P>
 Taggers and gangs put up their signs in graffiti to mark territory. Once a 
neighborhood is marked, other criminals feel safe to move in -- drug dealers, 
prostitutes, extortionists, businesses that buy and sell stolen property. When 
other gangs challenge ownership of that territory, you have drive-by shootings 
and gang wars. When graffiti is all over a neighborhood, it looks as if no one 
cares and anything goes. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's my system: I went out at night to study how the graffiti was put on. I 
photographed the graffiti and put the photos in a big book. I showed the 
pictures to neighbors and asked who had painted them. They began to let me 
know. 
</P>
<P>
 It helped that I know many of the taggers from raising money for neighborhood 
schools. I went to their homes and showed them the pictures, saying I knew 
they'd done it. They always denied it, and sometimes pulled guns. But I didn't 
hassle them as an authority figure, like a cop or probation officer; instead, I 
approached them as a neighbor and asked them to respect their community. If 
they resisted or threatened me, I told them I would report them to the police 
if they didn't stop. I always confront with respect and ask for their respect 
in return. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to stop graffiti, you need to paint it out immediately, before 
morning. Most graffiti goes up on weekends. If you paint it out before other 
taggers see it Monday morning, it takes the fun out of it for them. Criminals 
talk to one another. Criminals want things easy. If you make things hard, they 
lose interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, I made a truce with a gang leader in our area. I asked him to please 
reconsider spraying out of respect for our neighborhood. And mostly his gang 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Respect. It's always respect.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TESTIMONY; ONE 
PERSON'S STORY ABOUT CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES; 'I THINK HE WOULD ENJOY 
COMPANY OF OTHER KIDS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By As Told to ROBERT SCHEER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Illana Katz is the publisher and author of Real Life Storybooks in Northridge. 
One of her books, "Joey and Sam," deals with autism, which afflicts her 
youngest child. Katz praises the Los Angeles Unified School District for the 
services it provides to autistic children.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm the mother of four children. The youngest is 8, the oldest is 25. The one 
that is 8 has autism.  
</P>
<P>
 I knew something was wrong with him when he was 2 1/2. He was speaking a 
little bit at the time. When he was 3, he could say maybe a dozen words, but he 
wasn't waving, he wasn't pointing, his eye contact was poor. I began to suspect 
autism. So I took him to several doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was diagnosed, I was devastated. Our children represent us. Who in 
their right mind wants a child who is so severely different? It's like death. 
You suffer the death of your expectations for your child. At least, temporarily 
you do. You have to find a new set of standards by which you are going to 
operate.  
</P>
<P>
 But once he started speech therapy, he grew by leaps and bounds. Once he 
understood what was going on around him and what I expected from him, he 
started to learn how to communicate better with me. He clearly moved much more 
into this world. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a behaviorist came to my home. The L.A. Unified School District provides 
a lot of services for children with autism, and they sent a behaviorist who 
taught me how to discipline, or to guide, my child. And you know something? I 
wish I had had those techniques when the other three children growing up, 
because it was nothing more than being consistent and making the child follow 
through -- being helpful, rewarding things they do right and not punishing for 
things they don't do as you expected. It has made all the difference.  
</P>
<P>
 And now, at 8, my child certainly spells better than other kids his age; he 
reads better than other kids his age; his mathematics are fair. That doesn't 
mean he understands what he is reading as well as other children, but he's a 
good little reader.  
</P>
<P>
 Is he ever going to be completely normal? Probably not. But he could be close 
enough. Certainly I'll see him go to college; there'll be no problem with him 
getting into college. Will there be a problem with him marrying and having 
children? The jury is out on that one. 
</P>
<P>
 He still doesn't play much with other kids. He tries, though. He's trying. The 
sensory-integration therapy program during which he spends time with 
non-autistic students really helps. But it tears me up when he doesn't get 
invited to their birthday parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Is he lonely? I think he would enjoy the company of a lot of other children. I 
take him to places where there are other children. He loves to be around them. 
He follows them around and tries very hard to socialize with them. But he still 
must be lonely. 
</P>
<P>
 At school, children are very helpful, the non-disabled ones, and they do their 
best to integrate him into a game. But he has to understand the rules of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 With my books, I'm trying to prevent kids from making fun of children with 
disabilities, being cruel because they don't know any better. That's why I'm 
writing. Not only to teach children about the disabilities or the diseases, but 
to help them grow up to be better, more caring people. Lord knows, we could use 
all we can get. Is it naive on my part? Probably. Am I going to try anyway? Of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, disabled kids are integrated full-time with kids who are 
non-disabled, or "normal," or whatever you want to call them (I usually say 
"non-disabled.") And when you explain to children why these other kids are 
different, they become incredibly helpful and wind up reaping tremendous 
benefits. Yes, the child with the disability benefits, but the non-disabled 
child does too. They get a chance to be helpful and caring and loving and 
understanding and, as a by-product, they're proud of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll tell you a little story. My son's regular classroom and his special-needs 
classroom are back to back. It's really nice. Well, there was this one little 
boy -- who happens to be black and comes from the inner city -- and he was my 
son's mentor. My son just loved Seth and, of course, Seth loved him. He 
showered Seth with attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Come the end of the school year, I found out accidentally that this little boy 
had been a problem -- a pain in the neck -- in class until our child started 
coming in. But after that, Seth became a model student; he was helpful, caring. 
I spoke to Seth a few months ago and asked him, "What do you want to be when 
you grow up?" He said, "I want to be a teacher like Mr. Rome. I want to help 
children like Seth." 
</P>
<P>
 That says it all right there. 
</P>
<P>
 I think we find, in general, that people whose siblings or relatives have a 
disability are often more caring and understanding. They slow down long enough 
to feel, long enough to care.  
</P>
<P>
 People search their whole lives for happiness. They'll buy things, they'll do 
almost anything to find this elusive thing called "happiness." But happiness is 
right at their doorstep. I think that when people do something for someone 
else, the by-product they bring themselves is happiness. It's not something 
they're asking for and it's not something they expect, but it's something they 
get anyway. People need to learn that. It's right there for all of us if we'll 
only reach out and touch it. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll tell another story. There's a family with nine children, one of whom has 
severe cerebral palsy. She pretty much just lies there and doesn't do much. But 
one day, she smiled. She's 8 years old and she smiled. The entire family 
celebrated for days because their daughter had smiled. I think this says 
something too. Her smile made a dramatic difference in the emotional well-being 
of everybody else in that family.  
</P>
<P>
 In the past, disabled children were put in the closet, hidden. They were an 
embarrassment to the family. How could we have made one of those things? Or 
parents would send the children to an institution far away, hidden in a valley 
surrounded by mountains -- as far away from the public eye as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was a little girl walking down the street with my mother and coming at 
us was a child in a wheelchair, mother would say, "Don't look! Turn away," 
meaning don't stare -- it's not nice to stare, it's not nice to look. 
</P>
<P>
 I can remember wanting to run up to the child and say, "Why are you in that 
chair? Can you get out? Can I sit in your chair?" 
</P>
<P>
 When all had been said and done -- "What's your name? How old are you?" -- the 
underlying thing would be, "Can we play?" Now that we've gotten everything out 
of the way that, yeah, you've got a problem, and yeah, you're in the chair, 
"Can we play?" That's the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, looking away was what my mother taught me. She was trying to do what was 
right -- "Don't look, don't stare." 
</P>
<P>
 But I'm saying the opposite: Go up to that person, talk to them, they're human 
beings. Be friendly, smile, look straight at them. They may be very lonely.

MOYNIHAN THE PROPHET; BRAVE MARYLAND NAACP IN EFFECT SAYS HE WAS RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a significant breakthrough for the NAACP, the nation's oldest and largest 
civil rights organization, the NAACP Maryland state conference has become the 
first component of the group to embrace welfare reform. (The NAACP's national 
leadership, yet to take a formal position on welfare reform, is expected to 
consider President Clinton's proposals on the issue at its national convention 
in July). The Maryland endorsement eliminates a political obstacle and adds an 
important dimension to the growing consensus for change. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakup of the black family long has been a sensitive subject for African 
Americans. Black leaders, including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., criticized 
now-Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), then a White House aide, when he 
told of a 24% black illegitimacy rate and warned of future consequences in his 
1965 report, "The Negro Family: A Case for National Action." Civil rights 
leaders interpreted his findings as an indictment of African Americans, calling 
it an immoral attempt to "blame the victim." They pressured the Johnson 
Administration to remove the inflammatory topic from a White House conference 
on civil rights, thus torpedoing Moynihan's solutions. He had proposed a return 
to twice-daily mail deliveries to create more jobs, a national family allowance 
modeled after European and Canadian subsidies, and other remedies that were 
affordable then. 
</P>
<P>
 Government coffers now are extremely tight, and welfare has become a financial 
drain on federal and state governments, which share the burden. Cost motivates 
many politicians to champion reforms intended to reduce the rolls and mitigate 
the expense of providing for poor children whose parents cannot provide for 
them. The Clinton Administration currently is debating a panoply of changes 
intended to get poor parents off of welfare and into jobs. But the 
Administration so far has provided no clue to how the nation would pay the 
$6-billion price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare's financial drain is not paramount to the Maryland NAACP leaders. They 
embrace state welfare reform that would limit benefits and require work because 
they believe long-term welfare stigmatizes poor women and victimizes their 
children. They encourage recipients to take advantage of new opportunities 
under the reform to get off welfare. At the same time, they insist that the 
state provide sufficient education, training and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Black leaders have a responsibility to participate -- even though most welfare 
mothers are white -- because black parents are represented disproportionately 
on welfare rolls. By joining the debate, minority leaders can ward off more 
punitive approaches and advocate further incentives that reward poor mothers 
for staying in school or going to work. 
</P>
<P>
 History has proven Moynihan a prophet. The 24% black illegitimacy rate he 
reported nearly 30 years ago has climbed to 68%. And today at least 30% of all 
children born in the United States are born to single mothers. Their vulnerable 
family status puts them at risk of poverty, welfare dependency and a host of 
other daunting social problems. Reversing this trend will take a concerted 
national effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maryland NAACP leaders deserve credit for adding their important voice to 
the debate. Their courageous support has delighted Maryland Gov. William Donald 
Schaefer, who has proposed state welfare reforms largely modeled after the 
Clinton Administration plan and which parallel some of the noteworthy changes 
endorsed by California Gov. Pete Wilson. Common to all of those proposals are a 
limit on how long a person can receive welfare, a requirement to find work, 
provision of community service jobs and a requirement that teen-age parents 
live with parents or guardians. Such proposals now are endorsed by the Maryland 
NAACP. And because of Maryland's proximity to the District of Columbia, 
official Washington is paying attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare reform is political dynamite, but any politician who dares to call 
himself or herself a leader cannot duck the rethinking of this important 
national issue.

AMERICA'S STAKE IN THE AWESOME STRUGGLE OVER RUSSIA'S FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S.-Russia relations, whose course has seldom run smooth in this century, may 
be heading for another rough patch. 
</P>
<P>
 If so it will be familiar territory. Russians and Americans have never made 
war on each other, but more than once they have come uncomfortably close. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Bolsheviks seized control of the Russian Revolution in 1917, the 
United States militarily intervened along with other World War I allies in an 
effort aimed mainly at keeping Russia from making a separate peace with 
Germany. Not until 1933 did Washington extend diplomatic recognition to Moscow. 
But mistrust remained, even during the period of the Grand Alliance that 
defeated Nazi Germany. The hegemony extended by the Soviet Union over Eastern 
Europe after that conflict, the Korean War, the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 
and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 were among the low points of a 
cold war whose sudden end was proclaimed just a few years ago. With that 
proclamation came soaring hopes for a new era of amity and cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Those hopes have faded. The Russia of today is not the Russia of even a few 
months ago. Boris N. Yeltsin remains president and Viktor S. Chernomyrdin is 
still prime minister. But their government seems to have only an uncertain grip 
on the levers of power and a far-from-sure sense of what its strategy should be 
in the ongoing struggle to determine Russia's future. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's long history of authoritarianism has always cast doubts over its 
prospects for moving from despotism to democracy, from a command economy to a 
free economy. Deepening uncertainties about those prospects have prompted a 
quiet and necessary reappraisal of U.S. policy toward Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the rare surfacing, such as the bizarre flap in which he initially 
snubbed the visiting former U.S. President Richard Nixon, Yeltsin, perhaps for 
health reasons, has withdrawn from much of the daily business of governing. 
That detachment correlates with the startling showing made in last December's 
parliamentary elections by an anti-reform bloc dominated by extremists of the 
right and left. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two months ago Yeltsin assured President Clinton that he would stay 
the course on reform. That promise stands suspended. Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin 
have read the election results, which were widely interpreted as resentment 
over the unavoidable pains brought by economic change and which measured the 
success of the neo-fascist demagogue Vladimir V. Zhirinosvky. Their response 
has been to boot out of government the boldest advocates of free-market 
reforms, while re-empowering those whose economic ideas have not progressed 
beyond the stagnant Brezhnev years. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's foreign policy, meanwhile, shows every sign of being propelled by a 
rising wave of nationalism and nostalgia for the recent imperial past. Moscow's 
decision -- with its historical echo of pan-Slavism -- to involve itself on 
behalf of Serbian interests in Bosnia was widely hailed as serving notice on 
the West that Russia had re-emerged as a major regional player. 
</P>
<P>
 The region of most immediate concern to Moscow is the "near abroad," the 
states of the former Soviet Union where Yeltsin and others now talk openly 
about Russia's "right" to intervene.  
</P>
<P>
 The hard policy choices all this presents for the United States are apparent. 
Russia, as it has since the time of Peter the Great, is again arguing with 
itself over the direction of its political orientation. There is a realistic 
chance that out of this fierce debate could come policies and actions that will 
demolish the dreams that communism's collapse encouraged. This debate could, 
alternatively, rage inconclusively for some time. Thus the United States must 
remain steady and sure about where its own permanent interests lie, and gear 
its policies accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those interests is to encourage progress toward a free-market economy, 
however hard a slog that may be. The picture is not wholly bleak. Most U.S. aid 
to Russia supports privatization and entrepreneurship, and progress in these 
areas is impressive. More than 75% of Russia's retail stores and small 
businesses are now in private hands. More than 25% of the labor force already 
works in the private sector. Expansion of the market economy should be 
nourished. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States should also continue to enlist Russian cooperation in vital 
areas, for example, in nuclear non-proliferation. At the same time the Clinton 
Administration must support the independence and territorial integrity of the 
former republics of the Soviet Union. That doesn't mean extending NATO defense 
guarantees to these states, many of them embroiled in their own internal power 
struggles. It does mean making clear that Moscow will pay a high political 
price if it uses force to reassert Russian control in its former empire. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917 inaugurated a tumultuous era in Russian 
and world history. The struggle over Russia's future that has ensued in the 
wake of communism's collapse could be tumultuous as well. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. policy toward Russia must be rooted in realism, free from romantic 
illusions as well as from exaggerated fears. Europe's and America's interests 
would of course be best served if democratic reformers triumph. But outside 
powers can influence that outcome at best only marginally. Ultimately, as in 
1917, the forces that will decide and define Russia's fate lie almost wholly 
within Russia itself.

INNER-CITY PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After all this time, Craig Haney still doesn't get it (Column Left, March 3). 
By once again fixing the blame for the inner-city crisis on "heartless" 
government fiscal policies, Haney resurrects the same, tired old arguments that 
have been rejected everywhere in the world except the American academe. If the 
lack of job-training programs, neighborhood recreation centers, teen counselors 
and summer jobs programs are responsible for inner-city blight, how does Haney 
account for the fact that America's cities were in much better shape before 
these "compassion" programs were even conceived of? Does Haney really believe 
Reagan to be the first "heartless" President in our history? Were Kennedy and 
Johnson the most heartless, since the era of inner-city violence began on their 
watch? 
</P>
<P>
 As it happens, the new Democrats are just starting to come around to the 
understanding that Republicans reached 13 years ago: that these problems have 
their root causes in cultural shifts that have been occurring over the past 40 
years or so, and as such are probably not solvable by knee-jerk spending 
programs evolved by those who claim to be compassionate. What we further 
understand is that the very programs imposed by the "compassionate" to solve 
these problems are now a major contributing cause of the persistence of 
inner-city poverty, draining the self-esteem of those who become dependent upon 
them.  
</P>
<P>
 It is the destructive messages sent out by ideologues like Haney that 
frustrate the cultural corrections just now being formulated to overcome the 
complex problems of our inner cities. If Haney really wants to help keep youths 
out of jail, he should stop preaching the gospel of the discredited left, and 
encourage a return to the individual empowerment and personal responsibility 
that once made America great, a genuine national resource that has long been 
buried beneath tons of good intentions in the inner city.

'THREE STRIKES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three hoorays for "three strikes"! Charles Ernest Bentley has inflicted enough 
misery upon people ("50-Cent Caper Could Be Ex-Convict's Last Strike," March 
10). As the victim of Bentley's alleged crime was a 60-year-old homeless man, 
this case demonstrates how three strikes will protect the people who are 
wounded by crime the most -- the poor.Bentley's 52-page rap sheet, including 
manslaughter and kidnaping, shows he is one of the degenerates who are 
responsible for a large percentage of crimes, making the expense of his 
incarceration cost-effective relative to the cost of the crimes he would 
continue to inflict upon people if he is returned to the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times should publish an article detailing Bentley's 52-page rap sheet.

 On March 8 I read that the three strikes bill passed with enthusiasm. A few 
pages over, I read that our "state is abandoning its children." Doesn't anyone 
understand that poverty and crime have one long arm? That to warehouse a human 
being without any attempt at rehabilitation or treatment is in itself a crime 
of great magnitude? What is going on in this society?

TRANSFERRED PRIEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is not surprising that Hispanic Catholics at St. Thomas Aquinas Church in 
Monterey Park feel frustrated and demoralized because the archdiocese 
transferred the parish's Spanish-speaking priest and shifted the parish mission 
to attract Asians ("A Painful Choice Between a Parish and a Church," by George 
Ramos, March 7). 
</P>
<P>
 The divisiveness and loss of control experienced by parishioners show the 
inevitable problems of any organization that makes ethnic numerical goals 
overriding ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the Catholic Church predominantly hold social and political views 
far to the left of their parishioners. But ironically, many of their parishes 
turned into ethnically divided, segregated conclaves. Ethnic groups cling to 
priests of similar backgrounds. Clubs, activities and liturgies are designed 
for people of individual ethnic groups rather than to appeal to everyone in a 
parish, with charges that the church caters to particular groups. 
</P>
<P>
 This mentality has torn apart parishes spiritually and distracted parishioners 
from what should be the church's goal of bringing people closer to God. The 
archdiocese cannot ignore the problem, nor can it downplay its crisis of parish 
disunity.

 The treatment St. Thomas Aquinas Parish is receiving from the Los Angeles 
Archdiocese is an outrage which makes me ashamed to be Catholic. Cardinal Roger 
Mahony refuses to meet with the Hispanic representatives and also with 
Councilman Sam Kiang. Father Gregory Coiro offhandedly comments that the church 
is a hierarchy, not a democracy! 
</P>
<P>
 Allow me to suggest that the church is the last vestige of the feudal system 
and that in this case the prince does not care to mingle with the peasants. 
</P>
<P>
 No, I am not Hispanic, but I have deep respect for the significance of the 
parish to our Hispanic Catholic families. Why does this seem special to me, and 
not to those who are ordained to represent Jesus in this world?

PLATFORM; WHY BACK REFORM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS V. SEIDITA of Northridge comments on why those with adequate health 
care should be concerned about reform. The following is adapted from his 
remarks at the Sepulveda Unitarian Universalist Society. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What does creating a national health system have to do with me? 
</P>
<P>
 Because I'm frightened of what our market system health care may do to deny 
needed care to my children and grandchildren.Because of what long-term illness 
could do to impoverish my wife and myself, as it did to my two widowed aunts. 
</P>
<P>
 Because, today, my loved ones can be denied treatment at emergency facilitiies 
that have been closed or packed by the emergencies of children, women and men 
who can't afford more economical preventive primary care.  
</P>
<P>
 Because of what marketing health care is doing to 37 million Americans without 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Because I fear the reappearance of tuberculosis and other once-conquered 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of what soaring health costs are doing to undermine American business 
in an interdependent world market. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, I fear what the growing health crisis and its denial are doing to our 
economy, our democracy and to our people.

LOOK WITHIN FOR THE PERSONIFICATION OF EVIL; HEBRON MASSACRE: JEWS AND THEIR

 The 111 rounds fired from Baruch Goldstein's assault rifle in the mosque at 
Hebron didn't only take the lives of 30 or 40 Palestinians; Goldstein's bullets 
also pierced the hearts of every justice-loving and peace-seeking Jew. And, 
since he was a religious man who chose to murder innocent human beings while 
they were kneeling in prayer, in a place sacred to both Jews and Muslims, on a 
day celebrating the Jewish festival of Purim, his shots also rent the holy 
Torah and sullied the Jewish tradition. What, then, 
</P>
<P>
 does the religious community have to offer in response to this obvious act of 
"holy terror"? It is, after all, the expositors of the tradition who bear an 
extra measure of shame and culpability for the atrocity and must provide both a 
moral critique and guidance to fellow Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 In and around the Jewish world, one commonly hears that Baruch Goldstein was 
insane or that he was not a real Jew "because real Jews do not kill innocent 
people." Sadly, neither explanation is creditable, as they reflect the 
apologetic contention that the murderer was not really one of us, not part of 
our community and, therefore, we are not to blame. Lamentably, Goldstein was 
very much a part of us. He was an officer in the Israeli reserves and the 
leading physician in Kiryat Arba, the Jewish settlement adjacent to Hebron. He 
also was a known extremist. His militant outlook and his violent program were 
shared by other settlers and his worldview took root in Israeli soil. Most 
significantly, the strength of his conviction was drawn from the classical 
sources of Judaism. Goldstein, in short, represents the evil within, the dark 
side of Jewishness that is the product of centuries of internalized oppression. 
During the course of the greater part of the last two millennia, we had no 
power to act on these malevolent impulses. But in post-Holocaust Israel, where 
we bear the psychic weight of the 
</P>
<P>
 6 million while being confronted by a seemingly intractable enemy, whom we 
dominate, the temptation to embrace the seductive appeal for vengeance is 
almost irresistible. That is why it is all the more urgent for Jews to 
acknowledge the allure of this inclination as an initial step in a process of 
cleansing and ultimately purging ourselves of our demons. In order to move 
beyond our obsessions, we first must admit that they are ours. 
</P>
<P>
 Next comes the most difficult move for traditionalists: acknowledging that the 
sacred teachings of Judaism contain passages that, when presented uncritically, 
constitute incitement to violence. Consider the commandment to annihilate 
Amalek: "Therefore, when the Lord your God grants you safety from all your 
enemies around you, in the land that the Lord your God is giving you as a 
hereditary portion, you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven. 
Do not forget" (Deuteronomy 25:19). Amalek has most often been identified with 
the particular foe that persecuted the Jews in each generation, whether they 
were Haman's Persians in antiquity or Hitler's Nazis in the modern period. 
Recently, it has become common for some Jews to refer to Palestinians as the 
contemporary incarnation of Amalek. This viewpoint leads to only one logical 
outcome -- Baruch Goldstein and the Hebron massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 When scriptural doctrine is bound to temporal ideology -- and to a gun -- the 
combination is often explosive. For this reason it is incumbent upon religious 
teachers to publicly condemn Goldstein's literal application of the Amalek 
injunction and declare it immoral and contrary to 
</P>
<P>
 Torah. Not to do so is to be an accomplice to the deed and to implicate the 
Jewish tradition -- and even God. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbinic authorities, especially those in Israel, also must clearly assert 
that the Amalek injunction is of no practical significance. Either it is to be 
understood as referring to evil in the abstract -- the verse reads "blot out 
the memory of Amalek," not the people -- or, as a parallel text in Exodus 
suggests, the war against Amalek may be a divine and not a human prerogative: 
"The Lord will be at war with Amalek through the ages" (Exodus 17:16). It is, 
however, probable that Amalek symbolizes the evil that lurks deep inside each 
of us, and that the eternal battle against him is the inner human struggle in 
which we are constantly engaged. 
</P>
<P>
 I would suggest that the test to be applied to all of our teachings is whether 
we would feel comfortable circulating them before a mixed audience of Jews, 
Christians and Muslims. Does Torah reflect a universal ethic of tolerance or a 
chauvinistic legacy of hatred and bigotry? In that vein, it seems that all Jews 
ought to examine their attitudes toward Arabs and Palestinians. Too many of us 
view them as subhuman and are indifferent to the consequences bred by such 
prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a question to ponder: Why is it that, in the Middle East, the peace 
forces are led by secularists while the guardians of faith in both the Muslim 
and Jewish communities tend to be numbered among the fanatic opposition? 
Perhaps those of us in pursuit of peace should begin with this problem. It is 
the key to a future of mutual respect and reconciliation between the children 
of Isaac and the children of Ishmael.

PERSPECTIVE ON IMMIGRATION; BORDER CONTROL: SMOKE, MIRRORS; THE 
ADMINISTRATION'S GET-TOUGH STANCE -- MORE PERSONNEL, HARDWARE -- ONLY RAISES 
THE RISK OF ILLEGAL CROSSING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WAYNE A. CORNELIUS, Wayne A. Cornelius is director of the Center for 
U.S.-Mexican Studies at UC San Diego. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno's $540.5-million plan to tighten border control is 
already being implemented with, among other measures, the installation of 62 
stadium-style lights along a two-mile segment of the San Diego-Tijuana border. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic elements of the Clinton Administration initiative are not new: 
putting more Border Patrol agents on la linea; continuing the "blockade" 
strategy in the El Paso, Tex., sector; supporting the development of a 
forgery-resistant worker identification card, and hiring more investigators to 
help enforce the 1986 law that prohibits employers from hiring undocumented 
immigrants.  
</P>
<P>
 These measures fall considerably short of a borderwide "militarization" effort 
to choke off illegal immigration -- a step for which U.S. law-enforcement 
officials readily admit there is still insufficient political will. Further 
proof of that is the cold shoulder given to Sen. Barbara Boxer's proposal, 
approved by Congress, authorizing governors to deploy National Guard troops to 
assist border authorities. Not one border-state governor has taken the 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the political reality, the Clinton Administration is pursuing a more 
modest goal. As stated by Alan Bersin, U.S. attorney for the Southern District 
of California, it is "the cumulation of incremental measures . . . so that an 
effective degree of border control is established." Thus, the door will be 
closed, but slowly, and with little expectation that it will completely shut 
off the flow of undocumented immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, however, a difference in how the new border enforcement resources 
will be applied. They will be concentrated in just a few, heavily transited 
points of entry for indocumentados, mainly in the San Diego and El Paso 
sectors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton plan is perhaps significant more for what it does not explicitly 
say or include than for what it does. Examples: 
</P>
<P>
 The principal approach to immigrant control embodied in the 1986 Immigration 
Reform and Control Act (IRCA) -- changing the hiring behavior of employers 
through fines and criminal penalties -- is given short shrift. Only $38 million 
(7%) of the more than half-billion dollars allocated for Clinton's border plan 
has been earmarked for tougher enforcement of employer sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 As Atty. Gen. Reno said, in announcing the Clinton plan on Feb. 3, "Our 
strategy to control the border is deterrence through prevention (of entry)." 
The Clinton Administration has chosen to take its stand at the border, raising 
the barriers to illegal entry rather than systematically hunting down 
undocumented immigrants in areas away from the border after they have become 
employed. 
</P>
<P>
 The one policy alternative that could conceivably have a significant deterrent 
impact on illegal immigration in the short term is getting really tough with 
employers, of all types and sizes, by seizing their assets or by imposing such 
heavy fines that they could be driven out of business. But the political costs 
of such tactics are daunting, which explains Gov. Pete Wilson's striking lack 
of enthusiasm for this approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Seriously targeting employers also would be highly disruptive to sectors of 
the economy that are heavily dependent on immigrant labor, at a time when much 
of the country is still struggling to recover from the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 In sum, it is much less costly, politically and economically, to go after 
migrant workers and their dependents as illegal entrants or users of social 
services.  
</P>
<P>
 Equally significant in the Clinton plan is the omission of any reference to 
the strategy of immigration control promised by the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. The Clinton Administration and other supporters of the treaty 
frequently argued that cutting off unauthorized migration at its source, by 
creating new, trade-generated economic incentives for Mexicans to stay home, 
was the only approach likely to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, chafing under criticism from those unwilling to wait for NAFTA to work, 
the Administration is rushing into place law-enforcement measures that 
supposedly will achieve an "effective degree of border control" in the 
foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
 The most likely immediate consequences of the Clinton plan are twofold: an 
increase in the potential for violence along the border, and a shift of 
attempted illegal crossings to remote areas away from the newly fortified 
sectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence involving Border Patrol agents, illegal immigrants and the "coyotes" 
whose business is smuggling them into the United States has been on the decline 
for several years. This trend could be reversed, however, as ever-larger masses 
of determined would-be illegal entrants form along the Mexican side of the 
border and make increasingly desperate attempts to surmount the new barriers to 
entry. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who care about human rights and the state of U.S.-Mexican relations, 
this is not a trivial problem. Violent altercations between the Border Patrol 
and Mexican citizens have a highly inflammatory effect on Mexican public 
opinion, which generates pressure on Mexican officials to "do something." Thus 
the Clinton Administration's project to fortify border controls has the 
potential to put new stress on the bilateral relationship at a particularly 
delicate moment in Mexico's internal political evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's emphasis on stronger controls in the San Diego and El 
Paso areas will probably rechannel the existing flow of undocumented immigrants 
without reducing it appreciably. The measures now being implemented are 
analogous to tossing a few more boulders into a swiftly flowing stream.  
</P>
<P>
 Evidence of what seasoned Border Patrol agents refer to as the "balloon 
effect" -- squeeze it in one place, and it just bulges somewhere else -- is 
readily available. The apprehension of illegal entrants along the Arizona 
section of the border has risen sharply since the El Paso "blockade" was 
initiated. Similarly, a build-up of border enforcement hardware and manpower in 
the San Diego sector will simply shift the paths of migrants eastward. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate futility of this approach has been demonstrated by numerous 
changes is Border Patrol tactics and capabilities over the years, to which 
highly motivated illegal border crossers and those who assist them have quickly 
adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
 This picture is unlikely to change in any significant, enduring way unless the 
fundamental demographic and labor market forces that drive Mexican migration to 
the United States are altered. Politicians armed with symbolic "solutions" will 
have little or nothing to do with this transformation, if indeed it ever 
occurs.

PROZAC IS MEDICINE, NOT A MIRACLE; DEPRESSION: MEDIA STORIES ARE DISTORTING 
THIS DRUG'S VALUE; IT'S NOT A 'COSMETIC' 'SELF-INDULGENCE' TO CORRECT A BRAIN 
DYSFUNCTION. 
</P>

<P>
By RICHARD J. METZNER, Dr. Richard J. Metzner is an associate clinical 
professor in the department of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at UCLA. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of my psychotherapy patients, a very bright 41-year-old woman who used to 
suffer from suicidal depressions and is now taking steps to acquire the Ph.D. 
she always wanted, recently came into my office visibly annoyed. "Have you seen 
Newsweek?" she asked. "They're saying that the antidepressant I'm taking has 
turned me into somebody I'm really not. What are they talking about? I feel 
more like myself than ever!" She isn't the only person I know who is appalled 
by this latest outburst in the media's love/hate relationship with Prozac. 
</P>
<P>
 I have prescribed this medication for hundreds of patients in the past six 
years, and I don't know of one who has experienced the kind of miraculous 
personality change that is being discussed so much on talk shows and in the 
popular press. Quite the contrary: Appropriately selected recipients of the 
SSRIs (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors) and other new antidepressants 
find that their longstanding symptoms give way to what most of them would call 
simply "feeling normal." Is it any surprise that this improved sense of 
well-being creates sometimes dramatic increases in self-confidence, 
assertiveness and initiative? 
</P>
<P>
 If you can't actually change your personality with a pill, where did this 
fantastic notion come from? 
</P>
<P>
 It's right there in psychiatrist Peter Kramer's introduction to his 
best-seller, "Listening to Prozac": "I wrote about patients who became 'better 
than well,' patients who acquired extra energy and became socially attractive. 
My mnemonic for this effect was 'cosmetic psychopharmacology.' That two-word 
phrase, as it happened, did for me what Prozac had done for certain of my 
patients: It made me instantly popular." 
</P>
<P>
 While Kramer merits some praise for his diligent scholarship and articulate 
writing, the glib and inaccurate catchword that brought him into the limelight 
has threatened to undermine the credibility of psychopharmacological therapy, 
frighten away patients in need of treatment, demean current users and seduce 
the wrong people into seeking prescriptions. The problem is that he 
characterized as "cosmetic" rather than therapeutic the corrective effects of 
Prozac on the more subtle chemical imbalances that fall outside accepted 
definitions of psychiatric disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Although we don't have familiar names like "depression" and "panic disorder" 
for manifestations of serotonin depletion such as irrational anger, 
hypersensitivity to rejection, chronic pessimism, obsessive worry and fear of 
risk-taking, the personal and social consequences of these symptoms can be 
extreme. How many individuals who resort to alcohol and illegal drugs have been 
trying unsuccessfully to medicate their own chemical imbalances? How many 
murders and suicides have resulted from such disturbed states? 
</P>
<P>
 Partly hereditary and partly acquired through severe or inescapable 
environmental pressures, these well-documented disorders can cause otherwise 
high-functioning people to experience painful problems in their relationships, 
their work and their inner lives. No amount of psychoanalysis, psychotherapy or 
homeopathy can budge the manifestations of chemical imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
 As with any physical disorder, underlying causes must be addressed first 
before any other treatment can be effective. Patients have the right to expect 
all health-care providers to become adept at recognizing these conditions and, 
if unable to render skilled treatment, to make appropriate referrals. Since any 
medicine can create problems if used improperly, careful and ongoing 
professional attention to symptoms, side-effects and dosages is essential. 
Furthermore, the self-defeating patterns that typically form while people are 
chemically depleted will often continue to place an undue burden on their 
neurotransmitter systems unless they somehow learn how to manage their lives 
more effectively. Research shows that the combination of medication and 
psychotherapy works better than either method alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, there are still many professionals and self-help organizations that do 
not recognize the difference between SSRIs and addictive drugs. The fact is 
that, unlike addictive drugs, these medications have no effect on people who do 
not suffer from the chemical imbalances they treat. Although Kramer's 
description of the "better than well" patient might conjure up the image of a 
drug-induced "super-self," what he was actually observing was just the natural 
human response to having a longstanding biochemical burden lifted for the first 
time. There is nothing "cosmetic" about having a brain that works the way it 
should. If we would just set aside the American fixation on self-lifting 
bootstraps, we would recognize that the people who benefit from these 
medications aren't spoiled, self-indulgent individuals trying to escape the 
responsibility of being themselves. Nor are they frivolous thrill-seekers 
looking for a new kind of "high." They are human beings who know quite clearly 
that there is something wrong with the way they feel. 
</P>
<P>
 I genuinely hope that Kramer's trivializing and the misleading publicity that 
it has spawned won't dissuade too many people with these often treatable 
conditions from seeking or accepting help. Unfortunately, headlines and sound 
bites about "personality pills" and "legal drug cultures" seem to find their 
way into the media much more readily than do accurate and well-moderated 
representations of medical and scientific breakthroughs.

BOOK REVIEW / MEMOIR; HOME IS WHERE A MAN'S HEART IS? BELIEVE IT; A FAMILY 
PLACE: A MAN RETURNS TO THE CENTER OF HIS LIFE BY CHARLES GAINES ; ATLANTIC 
MONTHLY PRESS, $20, 195 PAGES 
</P>

<P>
 In public at least, embracing freedom and dissing family has been a favorite 
pose of male writers from Francis Bacon ("He that hath a wife and children hath 
given hostages to fortune") to Groucho Marx ("Marriage is a wonderful 
institution, but who wants to live in an institution?"). 
</P>
<P>
 As W. Somerset Maugham showed us in his 1919 novel "The Moon and Sixpence," 
however, the subtle truth is that most guys chase after freedom not because 
they are oblivious to responsibility, but because they are obsessed by it. The 
"policeman in their hearts," Maugham explained, won't for a second let them 
forget their duties and dependencies:  
</P>
<P>
 "Man's desire for the approval of his fellows is so strong, his dread of their 
censure so violent, that (he) has brought his enemy within his gates; and it 
keeps watch over him, vigilant always in the interests of its master to crush 
any half-formed desire to break away from the herd." 
</P>
<P>
 Intended as one man's paean to his marriage and children, "A Family Place" 
ultimately shows that men are still a long way from coming to terms with these 
conflicting urges. 
</P>
<P>
 Superficially, Charles Gaines' story is simple: He-Man Turns Family Man. In 
fact, early in this memoir, Gaines is almost a caricature of machismo: An 
ardent hunter, ice climber and scuba diver with a "hair-trigger contempt for . 
. . sensitive males," he makes his living as a sports journalist, writing books 
with such titles as "Pumping Iron" (written with Arnold Schwarzenegger), "Yours 
in Perfect Manhood" (a biography of Charles Atlas) and -- I kid you not -- 
"Staying Hard." 
</P>
<P>
 "I ordered steak and organ meats at restaurants when everyone else was eating 
pasta," Gaines writes, "and took to drinking my bourbon from a water glass 
without ice, just as my father had."  
</P>
<P>
 Realizing that the face in the mirror may well be his father's gives Gaines 
pause, as it has for many men raised by distant '50s and '60s dads. But not 
until the day he finds himself alone in a redwood phone booth on the edge of a 
sheep meadow in Tasmania does he truly awaken. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife is on the line, telling him, "Come home. Now." When he explains that 
he's busy fishing for barramundi, she coolly asks for a divorce.  
</P>
<P>
 As he flies home, Gaines poignantly flashes back on his joyful days as a 
father:  
</P>
<P>
 "Our life was the sweet warmth of a child on your lap while watching 
television, making cinnamon toast with Greta, taking Latham for his first canoe 
ride, taking all three of them out to dinner at Pizza Hut. . . . Seeing new 
emotions and thoughts cross over their faces like the shadows of clouds. . . . 
Nothing had prepared me for the riot of familial love and happiness Patricia 
and I harvested in those days, or for the exhilarating feeling we had of 
overwhelming completeness, of needing nothing other than each other and the 
kids to found the city of Rome if we wanted, or fly to the moon." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Fred Barthelme's protagonist Del Tribute, who finds in storms a kind of 
"rapture . . . a swoon of well-being and rightness," Gaines looks to Mother 
Nature for a force to revive his marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife buy 160 acres in Nova Scotia. "With its clean glimpses of 
ocean everywhere, its cool, bracing air and straight ahead, cheerful people," 
it is, Gaines writes, one of the world's "last, best places." Along with his 
three kids, now in their 20s, Gaines builds a "family place" there and finally 
settles into "the peace of familiarity that makes sleep dreamless."  
</P>
<P>
 Or so, at least, goes the Cliffs Notes' version of Gaines' story. In truth, 
the man who embraces the peace of family and familiarity might only be Gaines' 
wishful self-caricature. Gaines' kids leave after several weeks to reclaim 
their very independent lives. And only a few pages after construction ends on 
his supposedly "solid, rooted place," Gaines, with a straight face, writes of 
building "a bigger house out on the cape," more cabins "for family and friends, 
and maybe even, someday, for use as a summer camp for underprivileged city 
kids."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gaines' manic energy may be his way of dodging the "smaller and smaller steps" 
he anxiously sees his friends taking through middle age. It leads him to some 
pretty unrealistic goals, as in this quote from John Ruskin that begins "A 
Family Place":  
</P>
<P>
 "When we build, let us think that we build forever. . . . Let it be such work 
as our descendants will thank us for; and let us think, as we lay stone on 
stone, that a time is to come when those stones will be held sacred because our 
hands have touched them." 
</P>
<P>
 It's grandiose, to be sure. But it's also a refreshing antidote to the 
cynicism of many of Gaines' contemporaries, whose sentiments are perhaps best 
expressed by the Talking Heads song, "We're on a Road to Nowhere/Come On 
Inside!"

POP MUSIC REVIEW; ROCK EN ESPANOL : RESPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LOPETEGUI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It took a little help from some American friends, but the Mexican rockeros -- 
playing a major L.A. venue alongside English-speaking bands for the first time 
-- responded fully when it was needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Revolucion '94," a five-hour, fast-paced festival held Saturday at a packed 
Universal Amphitheatre, was strong rebuttal to the skepticism that plagues rock 
en espanol , especially -- and ironically -- on the part of Spanish-language 
radio stations that consider the genre unmarketable and elitist. With fine 
performances by four Mexican bands and three U.S. acts, it was a night that 
might have marked the coming of age of rock en espanol in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicano Secret Service's bold humor between the acts and an art exhibit by 
Chicano artists Los Four in the lobby added a broader cultural dimension to the 
event, but the focus was on the music, which began with an acoustic set by 
American progressive-rock guitarist Adrian Belew, who has has produced albums 
by two of the Mexican bands on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing the sentiments of the other Mexican bands and most of the 
predominantly Latino crowd, Santa Sabina's singer Rita Guerrero dedicated the 
group's set to the recent rebel uprising in Chiapas, Mexico. Her mention of the 
guerrilla Zapatista Army for National Liberation drew loud and emotional 
cheers, and Santa Sabina followed up with 30 minutes of Guerrero's Middle 
East-tinged, high-pitched moanings and the group's experimental funk-tinted 
music. Santa Sabina's solid playing -- and the charisma that's made Guerrero a 
counterculture pop icon -- compensated for their coldness. 
</P>
<P>
 Their label-mates La Castaneda, with their brassy sound and punk attitude, 
added more urban wildness than dark experiments. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Pennsylvania-based group Live provided the night's first pure musical 
highlight, with an aggressive showing by singer-guitarist Edward Kowalczyk. 
Longtime L.A. favorites Redd Kross (mostly playing material from the 
"Phaseshifter" album and a passionate version of PJ Harvey's "Oh My Lover") 
seemed to be enjoying themselves and were received with respect and interest. 
</P>
<P>
 A hard act to follow, but Maldita Vecindad turned in perhaps the best concert 
they've ever played in L.A. With singer Roco and saxophonist Sax constantly 
running across the stage, the group effortlessly switched from punk to ska to 
rancheras to funk, ending with a humorous, punkish version of pop star Juan 
Gabriel's "Querida" while the crowd yelled Mal-dee-ta, in soccer-game fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "La Maldita" has surpassed the show's headliner, Caifanes, in terms of musical 
vitality, but as Mexican rock's first commercially successful alternative band, 
Caifanes still enjoys the respect given to true pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
 Caifanes closed the concert with its first performance since its recent lineup 
change. Even without two of its founding members, the band looked relaxed and 
ready for its second chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 It'll take some time to appreciate the full impact of "Revolucion '94." For 
now, it's at least a good reminder that the charts don't always tell the full 
story about Latin music.

 Nancy the Host: Nancy the media darling . Nancy the brat . Skater Nancy 
Kerrigan poked fun at both images as host of NBC's "Saturday Night Live" on 
Saturday. The Olympic silver medalist even spoofed her own skating -- doing a 
slapstick pairs number with chunky cast member Chris Farley in which she spun 
gracefully around her sweating, lurching partner. Kerrigan displayed a 
less-than-silver tongue as she tried to make the jump from lutz to laughs, but 
some of her punch lines did manage to break the ice. During her opening 
monologue, she took questions from "the audience," including a performer 
dressed as gold medalist Oksana Baiul -- who couldn't stop crying. She also 
took a question from "Tonya," who asked jealously who was scheduled to host the 
show next week. And Kerrigan alluded to a comment she made during a Disney 
World parade, calling it "the horniest" -- not the corniest -- thing she's ever 
done.

 Pilots, Prepare for Take-Off: Pilot season is well under way in TV-land, with 
various projects vying for air time next season already in the works. Comic Mo 
Gaffney taped a presentation for CBS Thursday -- which she co-wrote and 
co-produced with partner Lisa Amsterdam -- titled "Days Like This," set at a 
women's magazine. "LAX 2194," a science-fiction sitcom for Fox about workers at 
an intergalactic customs office at LAX 200 years in the future, is scheduled to 
be shot Wednesday. Stand-up comic Steve Harvey plays the widowed father of 
three sons on a pilot he's doing for ABC. And Warner Bros. is casting "Medicine 
Balls," a drama about young doctors. MOVIES

 'Guarding' No. 1: "Guarding Tess" jumped into the top spot at the box office 
during the weekend, its first in release. The comedy from TriStar, starring 
Shirley MacLaine as a feisty former First Lady, took in $7.1 million, according 
to early industry estimates. Next was another newcomer, Savoy Pictures' 
"Lightning Jack," a Western starring Paul Hogan, with $5.5 million. Warner 
Bros.' "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" dropped to third place with $4.1 million. 
In fourth was yet another new release, Touchstone Pictures' "The Ref," with 
$3.5 million. Rounding out the top five: Universal's "Schindler's List" holding 
strong with $3 million and a cumulative gross of $54.4 million.

 Lovey-Dovey?: The on-again, off-again marriage of actress Melanie Griffith and 
actor Don Johnson appeared to be on again Saturday, just 24 hours after it was 
off again. Griffith petitioned for divorce from Johnson Friday in Los Angeles 
Superior Court, nearly five years after they were married for the second time. 
But TV and radio reports said the two were together at their ranch in Aspen 
early Saturday, trying to reconcile their differences. And then the couple were 
seen looking quite chummy at the American Cinema Editors awards ceremony in 
Beverly Hills on Saturday night. Johnson, who presented the best feature film 
editing award, told the audience jokingly that he and Griffith were late to the 
event because they had to stop off at the courthouse to retrieve some papers.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; SCORPIONS' ROCK OF AGES PAST A WELCOME CHANGE AT FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're starved for old-fashioned arena hard-rock, even the Scorpions sound 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the Nirvanas and Pearl Jams dominating rock these days, with their 
intensity, insight, Angst and preoccupation with the offbeat, it was a pleasant 
change on Friday at the Forum to stroll down memory lane with a dinosaur like 
the Scorpions, who are dedicated to mindless, party-time, straight-ahead hard 
rock. 
</P>
<P>
 While sometimes rousing and gloriously anthemic, the Scorpions' music was most 
often shallow, with hardly a memorable lyric. For the pumped-up Scorpions 
crowd, though, that's not a negative. When you're grooving to "Rock You Like a 
Hurricane" you're not looking for words of wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 The German quintet does try its hand at meaningful music -- "Wind of Change" 
is a homage to the turbulent changes in Russia. The result: well-meaning but 
pretentious. 
</P>
<P>
 After 23 years on the rock circuit, they don't rock as hard as they used to. 
There was a mechanical, rote feel to some of the music. Lead singer Klaus Meine 
sounded out of tune and strained at times, but, as usual, the band did a fair 
job of covering up his mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scorpions show may have been occasional fun and a welcome change from a 
steady diet of alternative rock, but you could see why their kind of arena 
hard-rock is dying out. DENNIS HUNT

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; UNSUBTLE SET FROM PALADINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Paladins may be veteran road warriors, putting 75,000 or so miles on their 
van in a year, but all that experience couldn't save the San Diego roots-rock 
trio from a bad sound mix before a packed house at the Whisky on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stand on one side and get trebly blasts of Dave Gonzalez's dexterous 
guitar.Stand on the other and hear Tom Yearsley's upright bass pumped to a 
volume that would have made Motorhead's Lemmy smile. Stand at the corner of the 
upstairs bar and there was a tolerable balance -- of course, you couldn't see 
anything from there. 
</P>
<P>
 But a funny thing happened when Los Lobos' Cesar Rosas, who produced the 
Paladins' upcoming album, joined the band for the last half of its 90-minute 
set. On such Rosas-penned Lobos tunes as "Why Do You Do," "Don't Worry Baby" 
and "I Can't Understand," such things as song craft and dynamics came into 
play, and suddenly the bad sound wasn't nearly as bothersome. DON SNOWDEN

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: FILMFORUM'S NOW SCRATCHING THE BELLY OF VIDEO; 'CUTTING 
EDGE MEDIA' SHOWCASES EXPERIMENTAL FILMS BY KEY ARTISTS THAT HAVE BEEN 
PRESENTED OVER THE YEARS AND, MORE COMPREHENSIVELY, A SURVEY OF VIDEO WORKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Filmforum's monumental "Scratching the Belly of the Beast: Cutting Edge Media 
in Los Angeles, 1992-94" presents "L.A. Video: Scratching the Surface," at 
Hollywood Moguls (1650 N. Hudson Ave.), tonight at 8 p.m. and on Wednesday at 8 
p.m., "Fitful Flashes," a program by filmmakers who have been showcased by 
Filmforum over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Both programs are daunting and range widely from the self-indulgent and murky 
to the challenging and captivating. The video survey is far more accessible and 
comprehensive, chronicling how artists began to explore the possibilities of a 
brand-new medium. The second half of the video program is more engaging. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights of this portion include Wendy Clarke's "Love Tapes" (1981-), in 
which she turns her camera on her subject and asks that he or she discuss for 
three minutes the meaning of love. Especially poignant is a young disabled 
Japanese man who tells us, via subtitles, that "love makes it possible to open 
hearts closed by fear of rejection." Later, a bright fifth-grader, as part of 
her definition, tells us that adults forget what it's like to be a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Nina Sobell's similarly ongoing "Electro-Encephalographic Video Drawings" 
(1972-) involves a breathtakingly ambitious and complex experiment whose 
starting point involves getting the brain waves of two individuals in sync as a 
way of exploring the possibilities of nonverbal communication. Both Chris 
Burden and Bill Viola represent successful attempts to get brief experimental 
work on mainstream TV.  
</P>
<P>
 In the '70s, Burden created several amusing verbal and visual gags that had 
wide repeated play, where a decade later Viola created his "Reverse Television: 
Portraits of Viewers," a series composed entirely of individuals ranging in age 
from 16 to 93 sitting silently in their homes for his camera. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, Kit Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz, founders of Santa Monica's 
Electronic Cafe, recorded, as "Hole in Space," their video-camera experiment 
that enabled, via satellite, passersby in Century City and in Lincoln Center to 
communicate through wall-sized video projections of each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Program notes tell us that "Fitful Flashes," which was curated by former 
Filmforum programmers Terry Cannon and Albert Kilchesty, represents the work of 
artists "who have shaped Filmforum's artistic vision over its first 19 years." 
Actually, countless presentations by the organization have been far more 
rigorous and impressive than this offering. While it's true that not all the 
films were available for preview, those that were more often were turn-offs 
than turn-ons.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the best is Craig Rice's "Zulu as Konoe" (1980), an experimental in 
split-screen multiple imagery that provides distancing necessary to absorb the 
full impact of a repeated shot of a particularly savage act of brutality. Betzy 
Bromberg and Laura Ewig's "Marasmus" (1981) is a rambling but often beautiful 
collage expressing feminist sentiments and typifies much of the program in its 
bits-and-pieces fragmented style.

 Chaney Double-Bill: The Silent Movie (611 N. Fairfax Ave.), has an intriguing 
Lon Chaney double feature Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m., "Mr. Wu" (1927) and 
"The Scarlet Car" (1917), both of which are being presented in excellent 
prints. 
</P>
<P>
 The first is one of the five most successful films Chaney made at MGM, a 
highly theatrical adaptation of a 1914 British play in which Chaney plays both 
a Chinese mandarin and his aged grandfather. A variation on "Madame Butterfly," 
it tells of the seduction of the mandarin's sheltered, innocent daughter (Renee 
Adoree) by an Englishman (Ralph Forbes).  
</P>
<P>
 This is classic Chaney material: He was drawn to stories of men who loved 
their daughters or wards a little too much. He loved to disguise himself -- his 
Chinese makeup here is one of his best efforts, especially for the aged 
grandfather -- and he had a passion for tragic revenge themes.  
</P>
<P>
 The handsome "Mr. Wu" has typical Metro gloss with superb production design, 
whereas "The Scarlet Car," a rambling tale about a proud bank cashier (Chaney) 
wrongly accused of stealing $35,000, is a modest Universal production. It's not 
very involving, but its historic importance is considerable: It is only one of 
11 of the 107 films he appeared in at that studio between 1913 and 1918 known 
to exist.

DANCE AND MUSIC REVIEWS; IRONIC VIEW OF 'PARADISE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dominated by dream logic, arresting film-noir references and cinematic 
editing, the ironically titled, 50-minute duet "Welcome to Paradise" received 
its first West Coast performances over the weekend in the Keck Theater at 
Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
 The work was danced by creators Joelle Bouvier and Regis Obadia, founding 
directors of L'Esquisse (A Sketch), one of eight modern dance companies chosen 
in 1986 by French national and regional governments to be given permanent 
homes. L'Esquisse is in residence in Angers. 
</P>
<P>
 Seen Friday, Bouvier and Obadia met on a desolate landscape undefined except 
for a rope harness and a desk chair. There they re-enacted a series of sexual 
encounters in which the man tended to dominate, but both characters appeared to 
be fighting against their own drives -- tender as well as aggressive -- as much 
as against each other.  
</P>
<P>
 One coupling resounded to the grand vistas Brahms provided in the opening 
measures of the C-minor Symphony. But such grandeur was undercut by being 
followed by Marilyn Monroe singing "I Want to Be Loved By You." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Roudier was responsible for the sound collage, which also incorporated 
music by Janacek, Shostakovich, Verdi, Arvo Part and the soundtracks of several 
Hollywood films. Marc Oliviero created the moody lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole was framed by funereal suggestions -- both the opening and closing 
evoked a graveyard, not exactly a hopeful prognosis for modern love. But the 
energy, commitment and clarity of the dancers' movements, plus their fluid, 
free-fantasy invention, kept the work consistently engaging. 
</P>
<P>
 To complete the program, two short black-and-white films by Bouvier and Obadia 
were screened. With its stylized postures of nine socially repressed, sexually 
frustrated women, who eventually get rained on and roll on the dirt floor, "La 
Chambre" (The Chamber), the second film, made obeisance to the obsessions of 
Tanztheater of Wuppertal director Pina Bausch. CHRIS PASLES

DANCE AND MUSIC REVIEWS; LEONARDO TRIO GRACEFUL AT DOHENY MANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The New York-based Leonardo Trio, making its third appearance for the Chamber 
Music in Historic Sites series, may have been familiar to the audience 
attending its concert on Friday at the Doheny Mansion. It was, however, a first 
encounter for this listener and, it is hoped, not the last. 
</P>
<P>
 The Leonardo Trio, comprising pianist Cameron Grant, violinist Erica 
Kiesewetter and cellist Jonathan Spitz, is as accomplished an entity as any in 
its field: interpretively alert, technically secure, optimally balanced in tone 
and temperament. 
</P>
<P>
 The players were able to make distinctions both broad and minute between the 
repertory works offered, the young Beethoven's delectably flashy Trio in 
E-flat, Opus 1, No. 1, and, from Schubert's ripest maturity, the mighty Trio, 
D. 929, also in E-flat. 
</P>
<P>
 For Beethoven, the Leonardo offered bright, edgy sonorities, with brittle 
phrasing in the three fast movements and a plush sonic ambience for the 
seraphic slow movement. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Schubert, individual and ensemble sonority became rounder, dynamic 
contrasts more extreme. An interpretation of power, subtlety and grace. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandwiched between these disparate monuments was the local premiere of a 
20-year-old Trio by Korea's Isang Yun, once an icon of the international 
avant-garde, at least as much for his outspoken (and cruelly punished) 
opposition to the repressiveness of the South Korean regime of the 1960s as for 
his music. 
</P>
<P>
 At this remove, the Trio sounds like a relic, with its arhythmic lines and 
mistily "Eastern" sonorities, replete with sul ponticello keenings, col legno 
scrapings and, inevitably for its time, (or even earlier), plucked and strummed 
piano strings. 
</P>
<P>
 To judge by the Leonardo Trio's expertise elsewhere, the performance, 
sponsored by the Da Camera Society of Mount St. Mary's College, must have been 
authoritative.HERBERT GLASS

A DIFFERENT MORAL STANDARD; USING THE MUSIC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would like to add a dimension to David Hockney's statement that "the Music 
Center is the least user-friendly of any place I know" ("Music Center: Heal 
Thyself," Feb. 7). My perspective is from a person who uses a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion is wheelchair accessible with 
handicapped-accessible toilets. This is fine, but the only area where one can 
remain in a wheelchair is the last row of the orchestra -- an impossible 
location to enjoy opera, much less see supertitles. Some with a disability find 
it hard to transfer to a seat and, when they do, can create problems for 
patrons who must "climb over" them. Perhaps this is a problem the Founders 
could address.

A DIFFERENT MORAL STANDARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kevin Weston wants us to judge a group of individuals on a different moral 
standard because they are African Americans ("Kids Weren't Laughing at 
Holocaust, Just Movie," Feb. 28).This is an injustice to all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Their behavior was inappropriate and unkind. This was a group of teen-agers 
that behaved poorly.

GEORGE RAMOS: BACK IN THE BARRIO, ONE MAN FINDS A NEW BOTTOM LINE; GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Louis Barajas has proved author Thomas Wolfe wrong. You can go home again. 
</P>
<P>
 The 32-year-old tax and financial consultant was uncomfortable with a secure, 
well-paying job in Newport Beach that came with a nicely appointed office and a 
view of the Pacific and the benefits of handling the financial portfolios of 
some of Orange County's wealthy and powerful. He wanted to come back to his old 
neighborhood in East L.A. and help the working-class folks he grew up with. 
</P>
<P>
 After long thought and with the blessing of his attorney-wife, he gleefully 
chucked the corporate job two years ago and set up shop in an office above a 
Mexican seafood restaurant on Whittier Boulevard. He put up a handwritten sign 
announcing that he was open for business. 
</P>
<P>
 When I caught up with him the other day, he was in a blizzard of income tax 
paperwork, struggling to make ends meet. He's averaging between 60 and 80 hours 
a week, charging much less in most instances than he did in Orange County, and 
it shows. He hasn't turned a profit yet. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's never been happier in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so happy doing what I'm doing," he says, "I wouldn't trade this for 
anything else in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When I learned of Barajas' bold move, I had the same reaction as some of my 
friends, Chicano professionals who grow up in the barrio and then think of 
going home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great idea but I'm too afraid to try," one friend says. "I won't make 
enough money to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Those with growing families dismiss such dreaming easily. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, we concluded that the only real pull for us to go home was a 
feeling of guilt that we had done well and should be giving something back. We 
are proud of our achievements but also a little embarrassed that we made it out 
of the barrio, leaving old friends and familiar ways behind. 
</P>
<P>
 So, anxious to make amends, we think of going home. If we can't, we get 
involved in community-based groups as a way of giving back. 
</P>
<P>
 In Barajas' case, there was no guilt. There was no fear of being a financial 
failure back home. There was no need to be in the faster-paced outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 "People look at what I did," he says, "and tell me: 'What are you doing in 
East L.A.?' They say it like a joke but they aren't really joking. But this is 
where I am from." 
</P>
<P>
 Since he came home in January, 1992, Barajas, according to many, has been 
making a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 He's introduced a new way of thinking to the old neighborhood: he talks of 
mutual funds, of setting aside money for retirement, of making plans for their 
children to go to college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never heard of mutual funds," says one Barajas customer in Spanish. "He 
explained it to me and said many people invest money in such things. Well, I'm 
now into these funds." 
</P>
<P>
 Barajas, who has a bachelor's degree in sociology from UCLA and an MBA from 
the Claremont Graduate School, pores over income tax returns with the idea that 
the taxpayer, regardless of the annual pay involved, can save around $5,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I prepare a tax return, I just don't see a taxpayer as having two or 
three dependents," he says. "I see a man with a wife and maybe with two kids. 
They ought to be saving for those two kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Barajas' best work, he admits, has nothing to do with money. He refers 
people who walk in off the street looking for a helping hand with a legal, 
medical or political problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may not be able to help them right away," he says, "but I'll eventually 
find someone who can." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes he meets resistance. For example, some potential customers won't 
come to him for income tax work because he refuses to guarantee refunds in 24 
hours as others do in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father asks why I don't do it, because he thinks it's a good thing," 
Barajas sighs, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
 He patiently explains that the so-called 24-hour refund really isn't one. It's 
a losing proposition because it's a loan for the amount of the refund that 
includes interest and a service charge to process the loan, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't come back to the barrio to rip it off. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like my fearful friends, I'm glad Barajas wasn't scared off. He's got the guts 
to do what some of us dream about but won't follow through on. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two years since he's been home, his persistence is paying off. He's 
talked another Latino from Orange County, certified public accountant Bill 
Torres, into joining him on Whittier Boulevard. He has garnered the area's 
respect and, in the process, new clients, including East L.A. boxer and Olympic 
gold medalist Oscar De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing is," Barajas says, "you have to dream. This is my dream and I'm the 
guy to do it."

CONSISTENT DIVAC FUELS THE LAKERS; PRO BASKETBALL: HIS 18 POINTS, 13 REBOUNDS 
HELP BEAT THE TIMBERWOLVES, 90-88, FOR L.A.'S THIRD VICTORY IN A ROW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Forget for a moment that Vlade Divac hasn't exactly faced Hall of Fame centers 
of late, that the only one in the last six games with any real credibility, Vin 
Baker, is probably really a power forward. Forget that because Divac has done 
just as much damage this season against David Robinson and Hakeem Olajuwon as 
against Lorenzo Williams and Luc Longley. 
</P>
<P>
 Divac had 18 points and 13 rebounds against the likes of Mike Brown, Tellis 
Frank and Stacey King as the Lakers scored a 90-88 victory over the Minnesota 
Timberwolves on Sunday. This was the Lakers' third victory in a row and fifth 
in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most consistent stretch of his most consistent season, Divac is 
averaging 17.6 points, 12.8 rebounds and 5.6 assists the last 21 games. His 
work in front of 17,255 at the Target Center came one game after he joined 
Scottie Pippen, Kenny Anderson, Ron Harper and Robinson as the only players to 
have more than one triple-double this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Divac has also led the Lakers in assists in nine of the last 17 games, has 
already established a single-season career high in that category with 23 games 
remaining and trails only Robinson in assists among all centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what makes me so happy," Divac said. "Last year, I really tried to 
find myself, especially after the injury (a back problem in 1991-92). People 
were booing. I don't deserve that. I know the Lakers pay me a lot of money, but 
that was not fair. So I decided that when I finish playing, I don't want to owe 
anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing for me is the confidence. When I've got confidence, 
I feel great, that I am a great player. When I lose confidence, I'm so bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never played so long at the same level. No more up and down games -- 
today 20 points, tomorrow two. Now, I just keep going." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers are going along, too, having come to to rely on Divac and Sedale 
Threatt as their only consistent players. Coach Randy Pfund went so far as to 
call Divac the go-to guy, words that as recently as last season would have 
sounded hollow. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the Timberwolves, Divac scored six points in the fourth quarter to 
help the Lakers overcome a four-point deficit to a team that came in with a 
seven-game losing streak and was without its two best players, injured 
Christian Laettner and Doug West. Divac's two free throws with 16 seconds 
remaining gave the Lakers an 89-86 lead they never lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The Timberwolves had a chance to tie and tried to get the ball to three-point 
specialist Chuck Person. But Person dropped the short pass from Micheal 
Williams along the left sideline, allowing George Lynch to pick it up and 
preserve the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to take credit for that steal," said Lynch, who played a more 
significant role by scoring eight of his his 12 points in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fouled immediately, Lynch made one free throw to give the Lakers a four-point 
lead.

WILKINS HAS CLIPPERS BELIEVING IN THEMSELVES; PRO BASKETBALL: L.A. BEATS THE 
WARRIORS, 120-117, IN OVERTIME FOR ITS THIRD CONSECUTIVE VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Clippers are playing like a different team since acquiring forward 
Dominique Wilkins last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins has helped rejuvenate the Clippers, who defeated the Golden State 
Warriors, 120-117, in overtime before an announced crowd of 10,086 at the 
Sports Arena on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're a better team and a faster paced team (with Wilkins)," said 
Warrior rookie forward Chris Webber, who had 35 points, seven rebounds and six 
blocks after sitting out three games because of a hip injury. "I think they're 
more confident. They've been in the same position for so many years, and maybe 
he brings a big light of hope." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who have won a season-high three consecutive games, are even 
starting to think about the remote possibility of overtaking the Denver Nuggets 
for the eighth and final Western Conference playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're definitely looking at the box scores, looking for the miracle on 
Figueroa Street," Clipper Coach Bob Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Mark Jackson, who had a season-high 16 assists in his last game, got his 
first triple-double of the season with a season-high 17 assists, a career-high 
13 rebounds and 11 points as the Clippers got their first victory over a team 
with a winning record since Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look on the right side of me and there's Ron Harper, and I look on the left 
and there's Dominique, and I'm trying to run the show," Jackson said. "We feel 
good about our position down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a team that will be very dangerous. We are right now, but just imagine 
if we played this way (the entire season)." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, who had averaged 31 points in his last two games, had a season-high 39 
points, one shy of his career high. Harper, who had 26 points, 10 rebounds and 
10 assists in his last game, barely missed his second triple double in a row, 
getting 11 rebounds and nine assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, who had averaged 30.6 points in his first seven games with the 
Clippers, had 24 points, six rebounds and three steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie forward Charles Outlaw, signed for the remainder of the season last 
week, had a season-high 19 points and 12 rebounds and center Elmore Spencer had 
14 points and 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing their first two games with Wilkins, the Clippers have won four of 
their last six. The Clippers, who averaged 101.5 points in their first 52 
games, have averaged 113.4 points in eight games with Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of Wilkins also seems to have had a positive effect on Jackson 
and Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who averaged 11.4 points, 8.4 assists and 4.5 rebounds in 52 games 
before the trade, has averaged 9.3 points, 5.4 rebounds and 10.5 assists in 
eight games since. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, who averaged 19.5 points, 6.1 rebounds and 4.2 assists in 51 games 
before the trade, has averaged 27.2 points, 7.5 rebounds and six assists in six 
games since. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who lost their first three games to the Warriors this season, 
including a season-worst 46-point defeat in Oakland on Dec. 23, almost let this 
one get away. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Clippers leading by 110-106, Billy Owens made two free throws with 
1:03 remaining and Chris Mullin, who had 26 points, made a 17-footer with 30 
seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors had a chance to win it in regulation after Jackson missed a layup 
and Spencer missed a tip-in with two seconds remaining. Golden State called 
time out to set up a play, but Outlaw stole Mullin's inbound pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers scored the first six points of the extra period to take a 116-110 
lead as Harper, who had 25 second-half points, had a layup and a tip-in. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors pulled to 118-117 on Latrell Sprewell's basket with 16 seconds 
left, but Harper made two free throws with 11 seconds left.

NHL ROUNDUP; DEVILS WIN AGAIN, CLOSE IN ON THE RANGERS 
</P>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The New Jersey Devils got 28 saves from rookie goaltender Martin Brodeur to 
beat the Dallas Stars, 4-0, Sunday night at East Rutherford, N.J. It was 
Brodeur's third shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 The Devils reached the 88-point mark, one more than the club record set in 
each of the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory also extended New Jersey's unbeaten streak to nine (7-0-2), also a 
team record. The Devils have lost once in their last 13 outings (9-1-3). 
</P>
<P>
 The Devils are again challenging the idle New York Rangers for the top spot in 
the Eastern Conference. The Devils are within four points, their smallest 
deficit since they trailed the Rangers by three points on Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers were dealt a blow Sunday when forward Mike Hudson was suspended 
following a high-sticking incident involving the Pittsburgh Penguins' Kjell 
Samuelsson. Hudson was assessed a match penalty for deliberate injury of an 
opponent in Saturday's 6-2 loss to Pittsburgh. Hudson is expected to miss 
tonight's game against Florida and the league will determine later how long 
Hudson's suspension should be. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 3, Hartford 2 -- Jaromir Jagr scored the deciding goal for the 
Penguins at Hartford. Jagr, after taking a pass from Larry Murphy, backhanded 
in the goal at 14:53 of the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 Jagr also scored the deciding goal in a 7-6 victory over Hartford on Dec. 7, 
but that one came in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 5, Vancouver 2 -- Michel Goulet scored a goal and assisted on Jeremy 
Roenick's 37th and 38th of the season as the Blackhawks ran their unbeaten 
string to six games with a victory over the Canucks at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Roenick also had two assists in the Blackhawks' eighth victory in 11 games 
(8-1-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 5, Tampa Bay 5 -- Eric Lindros scored his 39th goal of the season 
with 38 seconds left in regulation at Philadelphia, enabling the Flyers to gain 
a tie with the Lightning.

reintroduced to expansion's worst example on Sunday afternoon, and breezed to a 
5-1 victory before 17,174 at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 They led, 3-0, before the first 20 minutes were over, and were ahead, 5-0, 
before the Senators spoiled goaltender Mikhail Shtalenkov's bid for a shutout 
in his first NHL victory. Dennis Vial's goal at 8:43 of the third period was 
the only one of 28 shots Shtalenkov didn't stop. 
</P>
<P>
 But Duck Coach Ron Wilson had hardly finished sighing with relief that the 
Ducks have broken out of their offensive doldrums before he started worrying 
that their defense was regressing against the NHL's worst team. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get a 2-0, 3-0, lead halfway through the first period and it's hard to 
get any team to play hard and focus for 60 minutes," Wilson said. "I'm not 
trying to knock the Ottawa Senators, but they've had a long season and a lot of 
teams at this point would take them lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was disappointed with a lot of our effort defensively, but on the other 
hand I sort of expect it. I've been with real good teams like Vancouver in the 
past when they're playing one of the uh, newer teams. You get an early lead and 
you try to play easy. . . . I was more concerned halfway through the game that 
I made sure we didn't get into bad habits and sort of cakewalk our way into the 
L.A. game." 
</P>
<P>
 It is strange but true that a first-year team can look on the second-year 
Senators with sympathy. The Ducks have won 26 games -- 16 more than the 
Senators' 10 this season. Ottawa has won only once in the last 21 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got to be frustrating. They seem to want to play the season out," said 
Duck defenseman Mark Ferner, who was briefly a Senator last year but was 
actually deemed not good enough -- only to find a role with the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 The game against the Kings on Wednesday at Anaheim Arena looms large. The 
Ducks are six points behind eighth-place San Jose in the Western Conference 
standings. The Kings are nine back -- and they get a chance to cure themselves 
first against Ottawa on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Shtalenkov, who became Guy Hebert's backup after Ron Tugnutt was traded to 
Montreal, probably will oppose the Kings -- especially since Hebert hasn't 
beaten them in four tries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mikhail did a great job," Wilson said. "To a lot of people he might not have 
been the difference but to me he was. . . . At the moment, if Mikhail's going 
to be as hot and solid as he is, we'll go with him for a while. . . . I think 
you'll probably see Mikhail on Wednesday against the Kings." 
</P>
<P>
 Proof that the Ducks have recovered a bit from their disastrous offensive week 
came at 5:27 of the first -- when they scored a power play goal for the first 
time in their last 20 attempts, and only the third in 61. Troy Loney got a pass 
from Stephan Lebeau in front of the net and swept the puck in around goalie 
Craig Billington after Billington went down early.  
</P>
<P>
 A couple of minutes later, Billington was embarrassed by a shot from Todd Ewen 
that slipped out of his glove and over his head, then dropped in front of the 
goal line and bounced over. 
</P>
<P>
 Billington allowed a third goal to defenseman Sean Hill and was pulled for 
Mark LaForest after the first period, but it didn't get better. 
</P>
<P>
 Garry Valk and Bob Corkum also scored, Corkum notching his 23rd goal and 50th 
point of the season -- the first Duck to reach that milestone.

ROBINSON SCORES 49; PURDUE WINS BIG TEN TITLE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Glenn Robinson, the nation's scoring leader, had a career-high 49 points as 
No. 6-ranked Purdue beat Illinois, 87-77, Sunday to win its first Big Ten title 
since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue (26-4, 14-4) finished one game ahead of Michigan, which dropped out of 
a first-place tie with Saturday's overtime loss to Northwestern.The victory 
also snapped a six-game losing streak to Illinois (17-10, 10-8). 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, averaging 30.3 points a game for the season, had nine during a 
two-minute flurry late in the first half and 11 straight in another run in the 
second half after the Illini came within two points. His 49 points bettered his 
previous career best of 42 against Wisconsin last year and were the most by a 
Purdue player since Rick Mount's school-record 61 against Iowa in 1970.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; NORTH CAROLINA DEFEATS VIRGINIA FOR ITS 13TH ACC 
TOURNAMENT TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 North Carolina, ranked No. 4 in the nation, used strong inside play and the 
shooting of Donald Williams down the stretch to defeat Virginia, 73-66, in the 
Atlantic Coast Conference tournament championship game Sunday at Charlotte, 
N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of Williams' 13 points came in the final 45 seconds. Jerry Stackhouse, 
named the tournament's most valuable player, led the Tar Heels (27-6) with 14 
points. Eric Montross had 12. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 13th tournament championship for the Tar Heels and the 12th for 
Coach Dean Smith, who on Saturday got his 800th coaching victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia (17-12) used the tournament as a stepping stone to an at-large berth 
in the NCAA tournament. Freshman Harold Deane, who scored 19 points, made a 
three-pointer and two free throws to draw the Cavaliers to 66-64 with 54.5 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Williams went on his personal, decisive run. The highlight was a 
jumper in transition with 45.9 seconds left. BIG EIGHT TOURNAMENT 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Danny Nee just took another step to putting that other program at 
Nebraska on the map, as Nee and the Cornhuskers beat Oklahoma State, 77-68, in 
the final of the Big Eight tournament at Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first tournament title for a basketball team accustomed to playing 
in the shadow of the school's football program. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a giant step for the Nebraska program," Nee said after the 
Cornhuskers (20-9) went through Oklahoma, No. 3 Missouri and No. 23 Oklahoma 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamar Johnson scored 19 points to lead Nebraska. Oklahoma State (23-9), which 
had beaten No. 11 Kansas in the semifinals, got 21 points from Randy 
Rutherford. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant Reeves, the Cowboys' 7-foot, All-Big Eight center, made just six of 18 
shots as Oklahoma State shot only 35%. Reeves finished with 18 points. SEC 
TOURNAMENT 
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky won its third consecutive Southeastern Conference tournament 
championship by defeating Florida, 73-60, at Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky gave Florida a dose of its own medicine. The Gators shut down Alabama 
in the semifinals by packing a 2-3 zone around the basket, a deployment 
Kentucky used on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida's all-SEC guards, Dan Cross and Craig Brown, hit 11 of 25 shots -- but 
only two of 11 three-pointers -- and combined for 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodrick Rhodes, suspended from Kentucky's opening round game for a violation 
of team rules, sparked the Wildcats off the bench with 12 of his 15 points in a 
decisive 22-4 spurt in the second half. Kentucky (26-6) also got 13 points each 
from Tony Delk and Jeff Brassow, and 10 from tournament MVP Travis Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 17 Florida (25-7), making its third appearance in the title game and first 
in five years, was led by Cross with 17 points. BIG EAST TOURNAMENT 
</P>
<P>
 Providence got 16 points and 16 rebounds from tournament MVP Michael Smith and 
defeated Georgetown, 74-64, in the Big East championship game at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friars (20-9) were making their first championship game appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgetown (18-11) had three starters foul out, was hit with three technicals 
-- one against coach John Thompson -- and one intentional foul, but was still 
within 67-63 with 1:45 left. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Hoyas, making their record ninth appearance in the championship game 
and winners of six titles in the league's 15-year history, never got any 
closer. METRO TOURNAMENT 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford Rozier had 20 points and 17 rebounds as Louisville (26-5) beat 
Southern Mississippi, 69-61, at Biloxi, Miss., to win its fifth Metro 
Conference tournament title in seven years. It wasn't easy after the Cardinals 
struggled through the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Rozier, the two-time Metro Conference player of the year and the tournament's 
most valuable player, had consecutive inside baskets as Louisville opened the 
second half with a 13-3 run to take the lead for good. He had 14 points and 10 
rebounds in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Haslett had 16 points for Southern Mississippi (15-14). MEAC 
TOURNAMENT 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina A&T defeated South Carolina State, 87-70, in the championship 
game of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference tournament at Baltimore and will 
face Arkansas in the first round of the NCAA tournament. Phillip Allen and John 
Floyd scored 21 points apiece for the Aggies (16-13). SWAC TOURNAMENT 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Granger scored 31 points and grabbed nine rebounds, leading Texas 
Southern past Jackson State, 70-67, at Baton Rouge, La., for the Southwestern 
Athletic Conference tournament title. Texas Southern (19-10) will meet Duke in 
the first round of the NCAA tournament. NONTOURNAMENT 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa 83, Ohio State 74 -- Jess Settles scored 17 points and grabbed 10 
rebounds to become Iowa's all-time freshman scoring and rebounding leader as 
the Hawkeyes beat the Buckeyes at Iowa City. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Kingsbury had 18 points for Iowa (11-16, 5-13). Ohio State (13-16, 6-12) 
finished with a losing record for the first since 1976-77. Jamie Skelton led 
the Buckeyes with 23 points.

IRVINE'S DREAM DIES IN FINAL SECONDS; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: BROWN'S 33 POINTS ARE 
NOT ENOUGH AS ANTEATERS FALL TO NEW MEXICO STATE, 70-64, IN BIG WEST FINAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a season fraught with near misses and overtime losses, perhaps it was 
appropriate that UC Irvine finished a few seconds and a few points shy of 
becoming the best story among NCAA Tournament teams with virtually no chance of 
winning a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters' improbable run for the Big West Tournament title went to the 
wire Sunday, but ended in a 70-64 loss to regular-season champion New Mexico 
State in front of 4,052 fans at the Thomas & Mack Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of those special dreams that you have," Irvine Coach Rod Baker 
said. "It was a good story that continued to build each day, but tomorrow, it 
would have been a great story. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were striving for greatness and we were one day away from greatness. Nice 
is nice, but greatness is something else again. I mean, nice beats the hell out 
of going out with a whimper, but I wanted greatness." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters (10-20) accomplished one thing they had failed to do during the 
regular season. They proved their long-held contention that they weren't really 
a last-place team. Not in their hearts, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 For four days, they battled and, in the end, they went down swinging 
roundhouse haymakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks in great part to 11 three-pointers by tournament co-Most Valuable 
Player Chris Brown, the score was tied, 62-62, with 2:40 remaining, and the 
Anteaters were only one of Brown's bombs away from a tie with as little as 37 
seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a prize fight," Baker said. "We took punches, they took punches. 
We fell down, they fell down. And in the end, they were the ones left 
standing." 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico State (23-7) hung on to the victory by doing something they have 
failed to do often while losing four of the last five games. The Aggies, who 
made just seven of 29 free throws in the second half of a regular-season-ending 
loss to San Jose State, made eight of 12 in the final 2:23. 
</P>
<P>
 "Irvine played with a lot of courage," Aggie Coach Neil McCarthy said. "It 
wasn't decided until the final minute when we finally made some free throws to 
wrap it up." 
</P>
<P>
 With 41 seconds to go, Brown's 20th three-point attempt went in and out of the 
basket and Irvine's quest was over. Lloyd Mumford, Irvine's senior point guard 
who had helped bring this team to the verge of the greatness, was forced to sit 
and watch the Aggies cut down the net. Mumford had 12 points and 10 assists in 
his final collegiate game.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were so close," Mumford said, "just a couple of seconds away, but we 
couldn't pull it off." 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico State guard Skip McCoy, who made the all-tournament team along with 
Mumford, said he thought that playing four days in a row began to take it's 
toll on the Anteaters down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gave everything they had, but I think they finally ran out of gas," 
McCoy said. "I just think we were a little fresher." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Aggies had to survive another last-ditch three-point attempt by 
Brown, who finished with 33 points. His final three of the season was an 
NBA-range, off-balance shot that bounded off the rim with less than 10 seconds 
left. It would have cut the New Mexico State lead to three. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way he was shooting, the odds were in his favor," said forward James 
Dockery, the co-MVP with Brown who led the Aggies with 19 points. "But he 
finally missed one." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's early accuracy -- he made his first three attempts in the first 4 1/2 
minutes as Irvine jumped out to an 11-4 lead -- forced the Aggies to abandon 
their beloved match-up zone and switch to a man-to-man defense. But their 
characteristic board-crashing dominance -- they had 16 offensive rebounds -- 
and defense on the rest of the Anteaters kept them in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Brown will beat you if you play good defense on everyone else 
and if you're scoring," said McCarthy, whose team is making its fifth 
consecutive appearance in the NCAA Tournament after its fifth consecutive 
23-victory season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was concerned if we would be up for this game after getting such an 
emotional win (over Nevada Las Vegas) just 12 hours earlier. But we came out 
playing hard and I saw a re-emergence of that emotion in the last 10 minutes."  
</P>
<P>
 Baker, whose team came close to matching it's conference victory total (four) 
in one heady weekend in Las Vegas, was clearly disappointed but remained 
upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned how to win in during this weekend and I'm not sure it's something 
we knew when we got here," he said.

MOTOR RACING ROUNDUP; IRVAN GETS HIS FOURTH VICTORY SINCE JOINING YATES TEAM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ernie Irvan led seven times for 207 laps Sunday, including the final 45, on 
his way to winning the Purolator 500 -- his fourth victory in nine starts with 
the Robert Yates Racing team -- at Atlanta Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvan, who also finished second in the season-opening Daytona 500 and leads 
the Winston Cup standings by 101 points over Mark Martin, bought out the 
remainder of his contract with another team in order to take the seat left 
vacant in July when Davey Allison died in a helicopter accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great race team and they showed it again today," Irvan said. "The car 
kept getting better and better and faster and faster." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Morgan Shepherd, who led one lap all day and finished second: "We were 
just too even. One car was as quick as the other there at the end. We gave it 
all we had and he beat us." 
</P>
<P>
 Darrell Waltrip, in a Chevrolet Lumina, and Jeff Burton, in a Ford -- the only 
other drivers in the lead lap -- also mounted challenges during the race, but 
wound up finishing third and fourth, respectively. Martin finished a lap down 
in fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvan, who won $86,100, averaged 146.136 m.p.h. during his 11th Winston Cup 
victory, his first at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Russell took his Kawasaki 750 from the 62nd starting position to win the 
American Motorcyclist Assn.'s Daytona 200 at Daytona International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell, the reigning world superbike champion and 1992 Daytona 200 winner, 
averaged 85.010 m.p.h. around the 3.56-mile road circuit to win by 2.918 
seconds. He earned $16,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernhard Schick crashed on lap 31 of the 57-circuit race, allowing Russell to 
catch eventual runner-up Troy Corser, who held a 10- to 15-second lead on 
Russell at the time of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was making the progress I needed to make before the red flag," Russell 
said. "But it definitely helped me. It allowed me to close the gap all at once 
instead of taking 20 or so laps to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Another key was Russell's crew's decision to bypass a tire change on his final 
pit stop on lap 46. He was sent back on the track in only 9.9 seconds with 
another tank of gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Schick, of Germany, crashed his Ducati 926 because of front-wheel failure at 
nearly 175 m.p.h. He suffered cuts on his left knee and scrapes on his hands.  
</P>
<P>
 Corser, from Australia, finished second in his Daytona 200 debut, followed by 
Eddie Lawson.

SAILING; LAST-MINUTE CREW ON TIME IN BRITISH CAPTAIN'S UPSET WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A month ago, Britain's Chris Law didn't have an invitation to the 30th 
Congressional Cup. A couple of weeks ago, he didn't have a crew. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the help of a few colonials, Brittania ruled the waves of Long Beach 
this weekend as Law won 14 of his 18 races to finish two ahead of Rod Davis, 
the defending champion and four-time winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, while Davis and Marc Pajot brought cores of their America's Cup teams 
from Australia and France, respectively, Law collected a crew of four Americans 
-- Wally Henry, John Hufnagel, Rich Matzinger and Steve Flam -- and Gavin Brady 
of New Zealand.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry to throw it all together and come in and win," Law said, "but it's 
good for the sport. If the America's Cup can be about that rather than all 
money and technology, it will be better, too."  
</P>
<P>
 Henry, the bowman who with Hufnagel was on the America 3 team that won the 
America's Cup in 1992, said, "Considering that three of us had never met, this 
was the best pickup crew I've ever been on. The chemistry couldn't have been 
any better."  
</P>
<P>
 Davis, an American expatriate ranked second on the Omega World Match Racing 
circuit, had special praise for Flam, the Long Beach sailor who was Law's 
tactician after sailing the circuit with Roy Heiner of The Netherlands for a 
year and a half.  
</P>
<P>
 "Steve Flam gets the man of the series award," Davis said, intending no slight 
of Law. "We've sailed against Chris a lot, and Chris is stronger with Steve 
Flam than we've seen him before."  
</P>
<P>
 Law entered his last three races Sunday with a one-race lead over San Diego's 
Peter Isler and two over Davis and Kevin Mahaney of Bangor, Me. But in winds 
fading from 10 to eight knots through the afternoon, all of his rivals sailed 
themselves out of contention before any showdowns developed.  
</P>
<P>
 Davis lost badly to Steve Grillon of King Harbor Yacht Club after misjudging a 
wind shift. Mahaney and Isler shared third place at 11-7.

TENNIS; MARTIN AND LENDL OUSTED FROM FLORIDA TOURNAMENT

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Todd Martin and Ivan Lendl were eliminated in third-set tiebreakers in the 
second round of the Lipton Championships at Key Biscayne, Fla., on Sunday, but 
top-seeded Pete Sampras and Steffi Graf both won easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, who will play for the U.S. Davis Cup team at India in two weeks, lost 
to Byron Black of Zimbabwe, 4-6, 6-2, 7-6 (7-5). 
</P>
<P>
 A finalist at the Australian Open, Martin continued his recent slump by losing 
for the third time in five matches. The American, ranked ninth in the world, 
said he is weary from already playing in six tournaments this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I just need a few days off, and hopefully I'll get the energy back in 
my legs and in my head," Martin said. "I'll just do something other than run 
around on a piece of cement." 
</P>
<P>
 Lendl, meanwhile, squandered two match points, including one on a disputed 
call, and lost to Jan Siemerink of the Netherlands, 3-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras, the defending champion, ousted Diego Nargiso, 6-2, 6-2, and 
fourth-seeded Jim Courier rallied to defeat Jeff Tarango of Manhattan Beach,

GOLF ROUNDUP; PRICE STILL THE HOTTEST DESPITE DALY'S RALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Daly, playing his first PGA tournament since his November suspension, 
made a startling run in the Honda Classic on Sunday at Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., 
before finishing four strokes behind golf's hottest player -- Nick Price. 
</P>
<P>
 Price shot a five-under-par 66 to win by one stroke. It was his seventh 
international victory in less than 12 months. Price's 276 total, eight-under, 
left Craig Parry one back. Parry had a closing 67. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his great play, Price doesn't consider himself the best in the world 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm probably in the top three or four," he said. "But to be No. 1 in the 
world, well, you have to have some majors in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly, the PGA's longest hitter and one of the game's big draws, closed within 
two strokes of the lead with a three-under 68 and finished in a fourth-place 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had a hat on, I'd take my hat off to myself," Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandel Chamblee, who led or shared the lead through the first three rounds, 
birdied the last hole to match par 71 and was third -- his career-best finish 
-- at 278. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly was tied at 280 with Masters champion Bernhard Langer of Germany, Davis 
Love III and Curtis Strange. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Albus shot a one-over-par 73, but maintained his wire-to-wire lead and won 
the Vantage at The Dominion PGA Seniors tournament at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 Albus finished at eight-under-par 208 to win his third Senior Tour event, his 
first since the 1993 GTE Suncoast Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished one shot ahead of two-time tournament champion Lee Trevino, Graham 
Marsh of Australia and George Archer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Andrews, who carried a three-shot lead into the final round of the 
Ping-Welch's Championship, survived a one-over-par 73 at Tucson, finishing at 
12-under 276 to defeat Judy Dickinson and 1992 champion Brandie Burton by three 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickinson carded a 68 -- a spectacular performance amid the problems created 
by 25- to 35-m.p.h. gusts -- but couldn't make up an eight-shot deficit.

NBA ROUNDUP; BARKLEY DOES HIS MAGIC IN VICTORY OVER ORLANDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles Barkley looked well again, and to the Phoenix Suns, that meant more 
than Sunday's 100-93 victory over the Magic at Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley, in his best performance since returning from a knee injury that 
sidelined him 17 games, scored 30 points and grabbed 20 rebounds to lead the 
Suns, who also got 30 points from Kevin Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the first game since he's been back that he looked like Charles 
Barkley," Phoenix Coach Paul Westphal said. "Now I hope he can bounce back. If 
he can, then the prognosis for our team looks real good." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the injury that forced him out of the lineup, Barkley was averaging 
24.1 points and 12.5 rebounds per game. In his first nine games after the 
layoff, last season's MVP averaged only 19 points and seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, though, he and Johnson scored 19 of Phoenix's 21 points in the fourth 
quarter and the Suns withstood a 39-point performance by Shaquille O'Neal by 
beating Orlando on the boards and getting 10 points from Joe Kleine off the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody played well," Barkley said. "Kevin was tremendous. Joe Kleine 
played well, Mark West -- they did the best they could on Shaq. But it's been a 
struggle for me to come back. I'm almost 100%, and I'm glad I'm getting 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Miami 106, Boston 87 -- Rony Seikaly had 36 points and 16 rebounds as the Heat 
won at Boston. Miami extended its franchise-record road winning streak to six 
and improved to 19-12 on the road. That mark is tied with New York's for best 
road record in the Eastern Conference and just a half-game worse than Seattle's 
league-leading mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Harris came off the Boston bench to score a career-high 22 points, but 
the Celtics made only 13 of 40 shots in the second half. Harold Miner added 16 
points for the Heat, which gained a measure of revenge for Boston's 112-110 
victory on March 7 in Miami that snapped a franchise-record seven-game winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 114, Washington 97 -- The 76ers hadn't won in five weeks, but 
they ended a 15-game losing streak -- the second-longest in team history, with 
a victory over the Bullets at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarence Weatherspoon scored 28 points and grabbed 12 rebounds to lead the 
76ers. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 114, Portland 102 -- Kendall Gill scored 13 of his 23 points in the 
third quarter when the SuperSonics broke open the game at Seattle. The Sonics 
led 95-67 after three quarters and coasted to their eighth victory in nine 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle was without Detlef Schrempf (flu) and Vincent Askew (suspended for one 
game). Nate McMillan returned after missing eight of the past nine games with a 
pulled stomach muscle and had 13 points, eight assists and four steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 100, Dallas 93 -- Vernon Maxwell scored 27 points and Robert Horry had 
all 13 of his points during a third-quarter surge as the Rockets were able to 
hold off a late charge by the Mavericks at Dallas.

SANTA ANITA; LAKEWAY REMAINS UNBEATEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Owner Mike Rutherford and trainer Gary Jones probably won't come down with the 
ailment that afflicted Allen Paulson a year ago at this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Struck by Derby fever after Eliza won the Santa Anita Oaks last year, Paulson 
chose to run her against males in the Santa Anita Derby. Although she ran well 
to be third behind Personal Hope and Union City, the Mt. Livermore filly was 
never the same. The Oaks was her last victory and she hasn't run since 
finishing fourth as the 3-10 favorite in the Princess Stakes last June 19 at 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Perfect in four starts against her own sex after a comfortable victory in the 
$212,800 Santa Anita Oaks on Sunday, Lakeway will keep running against the 
girls. The next major target for the best 3-year-old filly in the country is 
the Kentucky Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the (Santa Anita) Derby goes, we'll have to wait and see, but I 
really don't anticipate her running in that race," Jones said. "I've always 
felt, and so has Mike (Rutherford), that the Kentucky Oaks is just as 
prestigious a race for fillies as the Kentucky Derby is for colts." 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-10 favorite against five rivals, Lakeway tracked the pace set by Flying 
In The Lane and stablemate Beautiful Gem on the outside, took the lead in 
midstretch and went on to win by 1 1/4 lengths under Kent Desormeaux in 1:41 
3/5 for the 1 1/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Dianes Halo, a 10-1 shot, rallied to be second, three lengths in front of 
Flying In The Lane, then came Beautiful Gem, Fancy 'N Fabulous and Tulgey Wood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always tough on you when your horse is that big a favorite," Jones said. 
"I've known all along this filly was going to be good, but they still have to 
go out and do it. I can tell you this much, it sure feels a lot better to be in 
here (the winner's circle) this weekend than it did last weekend, and I'm not 
kidding about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was referring to the Santa Anita Handicap, when his Stuka was declared 
the winner after the controversial disqualification of The Wicked North. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lakeway, a daughter of Seattle Slew, has yet to lose, Desormeaux said 
she still is learning. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was just playing at the end," he said. "If she kept to her task, there's 
no telling how fast she can be. She's still got tons of play in her, which 
means if someone would come to her, she would go on, without any doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody could have ridden her. She just gallops around there. She's just 
fast, period. I'd still rather see her in the Kentucky Oaks with the fillies 
rather in the Kentucky Derby. I've just seen that done too many times." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In their last major workouts before next Sunday's $200,000 San Felipe Stakes, 
Brocco and Valiant Nature both went satisfactorily Sunday morning, according to 
their trainers. 
</P>
<P>
 With regular rider Gary Stevens aboard, Brocco worked seven furlongs in 1:25 
1/5 while Valiant Nature went a mile in 1:37 3/5 with Goncalino Almeida riding. 
</P>
<P>
 "He finished up real big," said Brocco's trainer, Randy Winick. "I couldn't 
have drawn a map to go any better. Gary said he's as good right now as he was 
before the Breeders' Cup." Brocco won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile by five 
lengths and is unbeaten in two starts at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Valiant Nature, who upset Brocco in his stakes debut in the Hollywood 
Futurity, had the fastest of five works at the distance Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He worked well, I was satisfied with it," trainer Ron McAnally said. "We 
might have a little blowout later in the week, but essentially he's ready to 
run." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The day before the seven-year anniversary of Laffit Pincay's seven-winner day 
at Santa Anita, the world's second-winningest jockey won four times Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The only loser Pincay rode in the first five races was Chevalier Charlie, the 
favorite in the second who probably should have been scratched after being 
extremely fractious at the gate. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning the first with 7-1 shot Toknight, Pincay came back with 
favorites D'Hallevant and Lil' Jessica Rose in the third and fourth races, 
respectively, then won wire-to-wire on 5-1 shot Western Man in the fifth.

SPRINT PLANS $350-MILLION UPGRADE IN NETWORK; COMMUNICATIONS: NEW FIBER-OPTIC 
EQUIPMENT WILL ASSURE UNINTERRUPTED SERVICE AND MAKE FASTER TRANSMISSION 
POSSIBLE, THE COMPANY SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sprint, the nation's third-largest long-distance company, plans to invest $350 
million in the next three years to install an advanced form of fiber-optic 
transmission equipment in its 23,000-mile network. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprint said the upgrade would assure its customers uninterrupted service when 
lines are damaged and give them the ability to send video and data traffic over 
its network at speeds two times faster -- to 2.5 gigabits per second -- than is 
currently possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kansas City-based company planned to announce the investment today. 
</P>
<P>
 "For voice customers, whether they are business or residential, this means 
they won't get cut off," Tony Alotto, director of technology integration for 
Sprint's technology planning group, said.  
</P>
<P>
 That's because the upgrade will allow a cut to a trunk line to be restored 
instantly, spokesman Jim Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a line is cut now there is a system that restores that, but it takes 
minutes to hours, depending on how severe the cut," Bowman said. "With the 
equipment we're deploying, we will be able to make it restore itself 
instantly." 
</P>
<P>
 The new technology will rely on an advanced form of a fiber-optics 
transmission called SONET -- short for Synchronous Optical Network. It will be 
installed in each of Sprint's 338 locations where the long-distance network 
connects with local telephone companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The company described the new technology as an innovation in the electronics 
that provide the light pulses for fiber-optics -- very thin strands of glass, 
for carrying voice, video or data information. 
</P>
<P>
 Alotto said the installation is taking place in three phases and should be 
completed by mid-1996. The first phase is under way already and the second 
phase will begin in 1995, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The upgrade will allow consumers to have quicker access, for instance, to 
remote databases from their desktop computers and will allow much faster 
transmission of video on demand, when it becomes available, and interactive 
services, Alotto said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, he said, businesses will be able to use the upgraded 
network for high-speed computing and faster transmission of other services that 
may crop up on the so-called information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even a superhighway has to grow in size and capability as new business and 
multimedia services emerge, and Sprint is already launching the next phase to 
stay ahead of the curve," said David Dorman, president of Sprint's Business 
Services Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcatel Network Systems of Richardson, Texas, and NEC America Inc. of 
Melville, N.Y., will supply equipment to Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprint said the new technology will also be a part of the 2,500 miles in new 
routes it will be adding, boosting total network miles to 25,500 miles.

ART REVIEW; DOWELL WORKS PROVIDE POWERFUL LIFT TO SO-SO SHOW; TOM KRUMPAK IS 
SUPPOSED TO BE THE STAR OF RANCHO SANTIAGO EXHIBIT, BUT OTHER ABSTRACT 
PAINTINGS OUTSHINE HIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If anything is likely to motivate you to visit the abstract painting 
exhibition at the Rancho Santiago College Art Gallery (through March 22), it 
won't be the title. " 'Very' Visual Dialogue"? Give me a break. 
</P>
<P>
 As artist Tom Krumpak writes in the accompanying brochure, he selected his own 
work from the past decade along with work by six Los Angeles-area artists whom 
he believes have influenced his style. Despite the self-serving theme, the 
exhibition has some wonderful things in it -- most of them by Roy Dowell. 
Dowell's paintings are so delicious to look at, so pleasing in a purely visual 
way, that even a small sprinkling of them elevates a so-so show into a 
must-see. 
</P>
<P>
 Dowell's small pieces have become more complex over the years while retaining 
the lush unexpectedness, the breathtaking rightness in matters of line, color, 
texture and shape that eludes so many others. His earliest work in the show is 
a gouache painting, "Untitled No. 264" from 1982, in which a straight-edged 
design becomes an improbable, hi-tech flower, poking out of a body of water 
alongside a curvy abstract shape that looks like a cross between a bug and a 
miniature atomic explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 In his painting and collage "Elegant New Culture" from 1987, the 
tongue-in-cheek reference is both to artistic and laboratory-spawned forms of 
"culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Rows of brushy concentric orange circles with brown centers (petri dishes?) 
are interrupted by a square of sand striped in green and white and an oblong 
patterned area. (Quasi-architectual scratchings of white and black on a brick 
red ground have a 1940s stage-decor look, recalling the work of Eugene Berman.) 
On top of this adroit melange, Dowell painted an airy linear pattern with 
Matisse-like curlicues in thick swipes of royal blue. Very elegant, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent Dowell on view is "Untitled No. 589," a collage from last 
year. In the jostling rhythms of this piece, the Ben Day dots used in 
photoengraving take on a decorative life of their own, alongside unidentifiable 
fragments of advertising photographs and snatches of printed lettering and a 
few identifiable objects. By collecting clues -- like the human eye, the 
picture frames, the magnifying glass and the strips of what appear to be false 
eyelashes -- a viewer might perceive a larger theme about the artist's role: 
containing and concentrating what the eye sees. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the other paintings in the show comes close to the levels of richness 
-- and optical pleasure -- in Dowell's work. A dispiriting thinness, glibness 
or tiredness haunts much of the work. 
</P>
<P>
 William Lane's paintings are cautious experiments in color layering in which 
the rows of rectangular swatches sometimes have the effect of superimposed 
fabric scrims. In an interview published in the exhibition brochure, Lane 
explained that these works are influenced by "the space and imagery of the 
churches" he has seen on annual trips to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Lies Kraal makes monochrome grid pieces that recycle minimalist austerity like 
so much low-key wallpaper. A piece in which tiny bumps of modeling paste mark 
the interstices of a faintly penciled grid on a white ground is unconvincingly 
titled "Buddhist Silence No. 2." 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell Hendler's work is high on conceptual whimsy, packaging instantaneous 
viewing experiences as amusing little objects. He paints a small pegboard 
yellow as the "lite" version of some forgotten immense minimalist wall piece 
("Little One") and covers a piece of pine wood with multiple coats of resin 
("Sand and Sea Club") that exaggerate the notion of a desirably shiny surface 
into a three-dimensional presence that seems more engaging than the object it 
covers. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Flaten Pixley is represented by three self-effacing drawings in an 
abstract, gestural vein that many others have pursued over the past three 
decades. "Dessin" ( drawing in French) is a spacious field of markings knitted 
together with gray and orange Prismacolor pencils. It's clearly a serious 
piece, but it doesn't effectively hold up its end of the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Krumpak's own work seems to have the most in common with John de Heras' recent 
paintings. Harsh colors, flat, eccentric shapes and repeated linear elements 
give de Heras's "Tower of Shame and Abandonment" a formal tension vaguely 
suggestive of a game board. 
</P>
<P>
 In Krumpak's big canvas "For the Boys," jumpy, brightly colored lettering and 
flat, curving imagery offer an unexpected counterpoint to a prayer that begins 
in English and segues to Spanish and Italian. The jaunty visuals are like a 
keep-up-your-spirits tune whistled by someone terrified of getting through the 
day in a violent part of town. This is all very well, but the work doesn't take 
us onward from there; it seems too wrapped up in conveying one unambiguous 
message. 
</P>
<P>
 For anyone who walks away from the gallery feeling less than encouraged about 
the state of abstract painting today, it should be said that there are 
up-and-coming artists doing insouciant and wonderful new things with it -- like 
Adam Ross, Steven Criqui, Nancy Evans and Jason McKechnie -- but they're just 
not in this exhibition. Maybe someone will roll up a curatorial sleeve and show 
Orange County what else there is. 
</P>
<P>
 * " 'Very' Visual Dialogue" continues through March 22 at the Rancho Santiago 
College Art Gallery, Building C , 17th and Bristol streets in Santa Ana. Hours 
: 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 6:30-8:30 p.m. Tuesday and

JAZZ REVIEW; UPCHURCH'S BAND HAS A SPECIAL RINGER TO IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Working with a pickup band -- a group of musicians assembled for a single date 
-- can be a hit-or-miss kind of thing. So when Phil Upchurch had to put such a 
trio together to play Randell's on Saturday, he brought in a ringer. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavy hitter was bassist Darryl Jones. Like guitarist Upchurch, Jones 
hails from Chicago, and from the bandstand Upchurch recalled them working there 
together some 12 years back. He joked that Jones hadn't had as great a gig 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that Jones went on to become one of the most sought-after 
electric bassists in the business: He followed Marcus Miller and Tom Barney in 
the Miles Davis band and then, after a long and fruitful stint, joined 
saxophonist Branford Marsalis to back up Sting. Jones later worked in another 
ensemble led by someone who goes by one name: Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
 But if playing with Upchurch at Randell's was a comedown, Jones didn't show 
it. He seemed really to enjoy adding bottom to Upchurch's quirky treatments of 
jazz standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The other members of the rhythm section also have had their days in the sun: 
Drummer Land Richards currently tours with Gladys Knight and Bobby Caldwell, 
and pianist Mark Massey has worked with violinist Stephane Grappelli, among 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 All that individual experience helped make the evening's first set far more 
satisfying than those you usually get from a pickup band. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that anyone in the combo was unfamiliar with the material. Upchurch sought 
common ground by calling off well-known, post-bop standards -- "Invitation," 
"All Blues," " 'Round Midnight." Massey wasted no time constructing a dense, 
speedy solo on "Invitation." Richards mixed it up on "All Blues," keeping tight 
time while decorating his sound with cymbal and rim-shot embellishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones picked clean on the bass riff of "All Blues" while filling between lines 
with up-register color and ringing, two-note combinations. He stuck to the 
lower register when soloing, allowing melody to dominate, foregoing the 
high-powered fireworks he brought to the Davis band. 
</P>
<P>
 Upchurch was in his usual fine form, with strings of clipped tones and 
suggestive chordal slides. He introduced "All Blues" on the acoustic guitar, 
then switched to electric for his needle-sharp improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
 Switching back to acoustic, he played an unaccompanied version of Gershwin's 
"Prelude, Number Two," providing his own chordal accompaniment while picking 
out the moody melody in a way that created fascinating stops in the piece's 
back-and-forth rhythm. It was the evening's single most impressive performance. 
</P>
<P>
 But the band found its own niche during "People Make the World Go Round," a 
swirling composition that alternates between minor- and major-key feels. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew brought a funk edge to the lyrical number, powered by a low end from 
Jones. Richards kept the piece tight and driving, releasing Massey and Upchurch 
to play some of their most ambitious improvs. If the entire set had been as 
energetic, this show really would have been one for the books.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; SCORPIONS' ROCK OF AGES PAST A WELCOME CHANGE AT FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're starved for old-fashioned arena hard rock, even the Scorpions sound 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the Nirvanas and Pearl Jams dominating rock these days, with their 
intensity, insight, Angst and preoccupation with the offbeat, it was a pleasant 
change on Friday at the Forum to stroll down memory lane with a dinosaur like 
the Scorpions who are dedicated to mindless, party-time, straight-ahead hard 
rock (they also played Saturday night at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre). 
</P>
<P>
 While sometimes rousing and gloriously anthemic, the Scorpions' music is most 
often shallow, with hardly a memorable lyric. For the pumped-up Scorpions 
crowd, though, that's not a negative. When you're grooving to "Rock You Like a 
Hurricane," you're not looking for words of wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 The German quintet does try its hand at meaningful music -- "Wind of Change" 
is a homage to the turbulent changes in Russia. The result: well-meaning but 
pretentious. 
</P>
<P>
 After 23 years on the rock circuit, they don't rock as hard as they used to. 
There was a mechanical, rote feel to some of the music. Lead singer Klaus Meine 
sounded out of tune and strained at times but, as usual, the band did a fair 
job of covering up his mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scorpions show may have been occasional fun and a welcome change from a 
steady diet of alternative rock, but you could see why their kind of arena hard 
rock is dying out. DENNIS HUNT

ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH / A SPECIAL REPORT: BROADCASTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 THE BIG TIME: Anaheim a broadcasting center? Well, perhaps once the National 
Broadcasters Hall of Fame and Museum opens at Anaheim Stadium in May. . . . 
Retired publisher Arthur S. Schreiber founded the museum in small-town 
Freehold, N.J., six years ago, but says it needs Anaheim's tourist traffic. And 
to help attract it, he's scheduled a banquet Oct. 15, and on his list of 
inductees is America's highest-ranking broadcaster: onetime play-by-play 
announcer Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 BROADCAST NEWS: Nowadays Los Angeles TV newscasts include Orange County items, 
but all-Orange County news programs have been short-lived. Public station KOCE 
and commercial station KDOC both tried and eventually quit -- too expensive for 
small broadcasters, says a KOCE official. . . . But cable may be the key to 
success. Orange County NewsChannel, the 24-hour-a-day cable news station, is 
now seen on all cable systems in the county. TV ratings services don't include 
its small audience, says a spokesman, but during the Laguna fires, "viewership 
was so high in Orange County that it passed the threshold" for measuring 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 PIONEER: Six Los Angeles and Orange County television stations have stationed 
news crews in Orange County, but once Jim Cooper had it all to himself. . . . 
Assigned here in 1966 by Channel 2, he spent the next years rushing film to 
Hollywood, sometimes while dangling from a helicopter's rope ladder. . . . Now, 
says Cooper, "they just microwave it in." Cooper, now retired, still produces 
occasional specials for KOCE. 
</P>
<P>
 SUMMER SCHOOL: Brace yourself. This summer, some 100 Fred Roggin wanna-bes 
will invade Orange County in their quest to become sports announcers. . . . 
Sportscaster Camps of America in Newport Beach offers a weeklong workshop in 
which students practice studio newscasts and try calling games at UC Irvine and 
Anaheim Stadium. . . . L.A. Kings broadcaster Bob Miller, a camp instructor, 
says hockey is the hardest sport to call. "It's hard to be accurate and still 
keep up with the action."

EX-REBELS WOO SALVADORAN VOTERS WITH SOFTER IMAGE; CENTRAL AMERICA: FORMER 
LEFTIST GUERRILLAS LEAD RALLIES AND APPEAR IN TV ADS. MOST HAVE RENOUNCED 
MARXISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Leftist presidential candidate Ruben Zamora, flanked by former guerrillas who 
until recently were waging civil war, gazed out Sunday over the smattering of 
red flags waving in this town's central plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "(My opponents) want to look at a past of suffering and explosion . . . a past 
that must be left behind," he told the small crowd. "(We) want to walk to the 
future . . . a future that we dreamed of, fought for, year after year." 
</P>
<P>
 In their first foray into civilian politics, El Salvador's former guerrillas 
have positioned themselves as the country's second major political force going 
into elections next Sunday, polls show. Despite internal divisions and serious 
organizational problems, the guerrillas, in coalition with four leftist 
parties, are expected to capture a number of congressional and mayoral seats in 
El Salvador's first post-civil war election. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 2 million Salvadorans, emerging from more than a decade of 
fratricidal war that claimed about 75,000 lives, will choose a new president, 
an 84-member legislature and 262 municipal governments. Rallies this weekend in 
cities across the country were capping an often violent campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N.-brokered peace accords in 1992 ended the war between Marxist rebels of 
the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN, and a series of 
U.S.-backed governments. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides had fought to an impasse, and with the Cold War winding down, 
both sides were losing their traditional sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the accords, the FMLN disarmed and became a political party in exchange 
for sweeping military and judicial reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Next Sunday's elections are seen as an important test of El Salvador's efforts 
to heal its wounds and build peace and democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora's underdog candidacy still lags far behind the ruling party's Armando 
Calderon Sol. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Zamora coalition has displaced the centrist Christian Democratic 
Party, which governed from 1984 to 1989 but is saddled with infighting and an 
uncharismatic candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 In a remarkable sign of how things have changed in postwar El Salvador, the 
men and women who for more than a decade fought to overthrow the government, 
boycotted elections and burned ballot boxes are now seeking to join the 
government through elections. With money from Los Angeles and supporters as 
far-flung as actor Ed Asner, the people who for years worked clandestinely and 
were branded as terrorists are today campaigning openly. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to soften their image as warriors, they lead public rallies, appear in 
television ads, and most have renounced Marxism. Posters with their pictures -- 
images of older, graying former rebels in suits, ties and tasteful jewelry -- 
are plastered all over Salvadoran cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials and the right maintain that the FMLN's changes are 
superficial and that its talk of democracy and free-market economics is a 
charade. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, many Salvadorans are not convinced that the left is capable of 
governing. Zamora's party, for example, missed a filing deadline and will lose 
several seats in the legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Dr. Zamora is a responsible person, but the political forces that 
accompany him have not completed the transformation process of (becoming) 
forces that can compete in a democratic election," said Hector Dada, a 
political analyst who heads a liberal think tank in San Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 The left is not expected to win the presidential election but is hoping to 
force a runoff, which is required when no single candidate receives more than 
50% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora, 51, trails Calderon Sol, of the government's right-wing Nationalist 
Republican Alliance, or Arena, by a 2-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
 About a third of the voters, however, either haven't decided or refuse to 
reveal their preferences. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora and the FMLN are also hoping to make inroads in local governments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each day we get by with the scene remaining (relatively peaceful), we've 
gained a lot," Joaquin Villalobos, the most successful of the FMLN's military 
strategists, said in an interview. "Really, this is historically the most 
important campaign ever in this country, despite the problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora, whose brother, an attorney general, was killed by a right-wing death 
squad in 1980, headed the political arm of the guerrillas throughout the early 
1980s. He returned to El Salvador from exile in 1987, ran for office and has 
served as a legislator for the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 For this election -- and only after bitter debate -- four leftist parties that 
are grouped around Zamora forged an alliance with the FMLN, itself an umbrella 
organization of five parties. 
</P>
<P>
 The union has not been a smooth one. 
</P>
<P>
 FMLN and Zamora's faction could not agree on a candidate for the critical post 
of mayor of San Salvador -- so each group is backing its own candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 The left's strategy has been to project a moderate face, attempt to overcome 
the fear that many Salvadorans have of the FMLN and reach out to El Salvador's 
vast, apolitical center. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora shaved his beard and looks more like a university professor than an 
erstwhile radical. In his television and radio ads, Zamora is careful not to 
relive the war years. Instead, he focuses on bread-and-butter issues of 
unemployment and medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 This has allowed Calderon Sol and Arena, some of whose leaders in the past 
have been linked to death squads, to exploit the war to their own end, blaming 
all the destruction on the guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zamora and his campaign organizers say they are sure that voters in the 
center do not want to hear about the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to Arena "would put us into an argument about the past, and that's 
not where we want to be," said Bill Zimmerman, a Santa Monica consultant who 
manages Zamora's campaign. "If we get into an argument with Arena over 
anything, we invoke a left-right split that works against us in convincing the 
middle to come over to us." 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy can be seen, with questionable success, at appearances such as 
Sunday's rally in Sonsonate, a town 40 miles west of San Salvador that escaped 
most of the fighting during the war and never lent much support to the 
guerrillas. Venturing into regions like this is an attempt to reach the 
uncommitted, but the crowd at the Sonsonate rally was small and subdued. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy was also evident at the left's largest rally, held Friday night 
in the downtown Civic Plaza to wrap up the campaign in the capital. To focus 
television images of the event on Zamora, senior comandantes of the FMLN were 
kept off the bandstand. 
</P>
<P>
 Villalobos and other top FMLN leaders, wearing red T-shirts and campaign 
baseball caps, milled about under the stage while Zamora spoke to about 10,000 
people who had packed into the plaza and climbed the two soaring bell towers of 
the Metropolitan Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the crowd waved red FMLN flags, however, showing that it is still the 
former rebels who have the drawing power. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora said he will spend about $800,000 on campaign publicity, believed to be 
a small fraction of what Arena is spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources in the campaign estimate that up to one-third of the money is coming 
from exiles and others living in the United States, where Zamora made several 
fund-raising trips to Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Asner, the actor known for his liberal politics, helped with fund-raising 
letters. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign has been marred by violence, underscoring the tensions that 
remain after the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Several militants from the left and right have been murdered in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 Arena's closing rally Saturday afternoon erupted in a furious melee as 
sympathizers of both Arena and the FMLN -- egged on by street riffraff -- 
fought with rocks, knives and guns. More than 40 people were injured and at 
least one was killed.

BOSNIA MUSLIMS, CROATS AGREE ON A CONSTITUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnian Croats and Muslims announced agreement Sunday on a 52-page 
constitution for a new federation they hope to create from the war-ruined 
regions they hold in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recognition that they can move no farther on the road to an overall 
peace settlement without the cooperation of Bosnian Serb rebels, the two 
factions that until a week ago had been battling each other conceded that the 
thorny details of their state-building will have to be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S.-mediated peace talks that have been taking place at the American 
Embassy here for the last 10 days will move to Washington later this week for a 
ceremony to mark what both Bosnian parties emphasized is only a first step in 
resolving the bitter conflict that has ravaged the former Yugoslav federation 
for the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. special envoy for the Balkans crisis, Charles E. Redman, said the 
constitutional agreement will be signed in Washington on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been very successful this week," Redman told journalists shortly after 
the constitutional talks adjourned late Sunday. "The next stage is to talk to 
the Bosnian Serbs to try to agree on an overall settlement." 
</P>
<P>
 The pact setting out a governing framework for the Bosnian federation being 
reconstructed by Croats and Muslims calls for a strong central government, a 
presidency, a prime minister, a federal legislature and an unspecified number 
of cantons that would be largely self-governing, Redman explained. 
</P>
<P>
 But he brushed aside questions about the number and shape of the cantons as 
secondary details, making clear the most divisive territorial issues remain to 
be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials seeking to broker a reconciliation of Bosnia's warring factions 
announced in Washington on March 1 that Croats and Muslims had agreed to end 
the clashes that have ravaged central Bosnia for the last year. The agreement 
included a commitment to build a binational federation within the Bosnian 
territory that the two parties had been apportioned during a year of 
European-mediated peace talks in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
 Those negotiations sought to deed 17.5% of Bosnia-Herzegovina to the Croats, 
who make up about that share of the republic's population, and 33.5% to the 
Bosnian government, representing the Muslim Slavs -- about 44% of the republic 
-- as well as several hundred thousand citizens of other ethnic groups who are 
still committed to a multicultural society. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a large segment of that combined 51% of Bosnian territory remains 
under Serbian occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how much the success of the new Croatian-Muslim federation depends on 
cooperation from the Serbs, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic replied: "A 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Silajdzic and Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic, representing the 
leadership of Croatia, which hopes to eventually forge an economic union with 
the new Bosnian federation, emphasized that the constitutional deal was only 
the beginning of a long process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's hope that this will be the first major step in the peace agreement," 
Silajdzic said. 
</P>
<P>
 Redman sought to portray the Vienna meetings as a breakthrough in the conflict 
that has inflicted the worst killing and displacement in Europe since World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been hard work, but from start to finish it was conducted in an 
excellent atmosphere," the U.S. envoy said of the constitution drafting. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said further work on territorial questions and the eventual 
Bosnian-Croatian alliance would have to wait until the Bosnian Serbs make their 
position clear. 
</P>
<P>
 That third and most heavily armed faction in the 2-year-old Bosnian war has 
shown little interest in joining any common state with the Muslims and Croats, 
which may complicate the other parties' attempts to forge a new state for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's special envoy for the former Yugoslav republics, Deputy Foreign 
Minister Vitaly S. Churkin, has also embarked on what Western diplomats see as 
a two-pronged effort to restore peace in the Balkans, with the United States 
using its influence with the Croats and Muslims while Russia takes advantage of 
its traditional ties with the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Redman and Churkin met in London last Friday to confer on the next steps of 
the East-West peace initiative, before Churkin traveled to Sarajevo to assess 
the prospects for getting the Bosnian Serbs involved in the new 
federation-building process. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has warned that the Muslim-Croatian deal 
appears aimed at isolating and pressuring his rebels into giving up territory 
they have taken, and the president of the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament, 
Momcilo Krajisnik, dismissed the idea of a new federation as "illogical." 
</P>
<P>
 But under pressure from Churkin, the Serbs last month agreed to withdraw or 
surrender heavy weapons that had been bombarding Sarajevo for 22 months and to 
allow Tuzla airport to be reopened for a humanitarian airlift.

ISRAEL OUTLAWS 2 EXTREMIST GROUPS; MIDEAST: THE GOVERNMENT LABELS KACH AND 
KAHANE CHAI TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS. THE DECISION SEEMS A KEY STEP IN MEETING 
PALESTINIAN DEMANDS FOR PROTECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Israeli government, reacting to the massacre two weeks ago of about 30 
Palestinians in the West Bank city of Hebron, on Sunday outlawed two extremist 
Jewish groups as "terrorist organizations" because of their repeated violence 
against Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
 In banning Kach and Kahane Chai, both inspired by the ultranationalist, 
anti-Arab ideology of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, the Cabinet made their 
leaders subject to 20 years in prison, and rank-and-file members, estimated to 
number about 400, liable to five years in jail if they continue their 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Kach, saying it will challenge the government order in court, responded in a 
statement: "We express our disgust at the fascist decision of the government. 
It is a surrender to PLO demands." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision did appear to be an important step toward meeting demands of the 
Palestine Liberation Organization that Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip be protected from Israeli settlers, operating as vigilantes, before talks 
resume on implementing an accord on Palestinian self-government. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO is pressing the government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin for firmer 
action in curtailing attacks by Israeli settlers and strengthening day-to-day 
security for Palestinians before it resumes the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government of Israel intends to continue all measures necessary to ensure 
security within the boundaries of law," the Cabinet said in a special 
communique, seeking to assure the Palestinians of greater protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reaffirms its commitment to promote maximum security to all residents and 
to act with its full authority to prevent a repetition of any acts of murder." 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians welcomed the Israeli move but said more was needed to revive the 
peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a positive development toward redressing a basic injustice in the 
Israeli judicial system," said Hanan Ashrawi, former spokeswoman for the 
Palestinian delegation to the Middle East peace talks, adding that the Israeli 
government must go further to disarm all Israeli settlers and remove them from 
Palestinian cities and towns. 
</P>
<P>
 "These extremists are still walking freely in the streets, near our towns and 
villages," Adnan Dameir, a PLO leader in the West Bank, commented. "It is not 
enough to declare these organizations illegal, but allow its members to remain 
on our streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Michael Ben-Yair said in announcing the Cabinet's decision that the 
continuing violence against Palestinians by members of Kach and Kahane Chai has 
created an extremely dangerous situation in the occupied territories. There was 
"no way to avoid infringing on the basic rights of people in these 
organizations," Ben-Yair said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Baruch Goldstein, who gunned down about 30 Palestinians on Feb. 25 while 
they prayed at the Cave of the Patriarchs, was a longtime member of Kach, as 
are other settlers in Hebron and nearby Kiryat Arba. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of Kach and Kahane Chai have praised as a holy martyr the 
Brooklyn-born Goldstein, who was beaten to death by survivors of the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben-Yair said the new ban will also apply to any organizations with the same 
goals, which include "establishment of a theocracy through all the biblical 
Land of Israel and the violent expulsion of Arabs from that land." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision won immediate support from former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. 
The hard-line rightist had fostered the settlement movement in the West Bank, 
but he nonetheless said: "Our country has no need for such organizations. No 
good can come from them." 
</P>
<P>
 The ban also makes supporting the groups or raising money for them punishable 
by three years in prison. Israeli officials said supporters from the United 
States could be barred from visiting Israel. Both groups raise funds 
extensively among American Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 But some observers warned that banning Kach and Kahane Chai will only work if 
the decision is followed up with tough police action to ensure their members do 
not regroup underground. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition to outlawing the organizations, their leaders and members must be 
personally chased," Ehud Sprinzak, a political scientist at Hebrew University, 
said. "They already believe the government of Israel is totally illegitimate 
and must be opposed by any and all means, including arms. You don't get more 
radical or dangerous than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Kach leader Baruch Marzel, who has been in hiding for the last two weeks, 
immediately telephoned Israel Army Radio to denounce the decision, and he 
warned that the government might do "even worse things" as it hunted Kach 
members down. 
</P>
<P>
 Marzel nonetheless said Kach will suspend its activities pending a court 
ruling on the decision. The Boston-born Marzel, who lives in Hebron, took over 
Kach's leadership after Meir Kahane was murdered in New York City in November, 
1990, and the movement splintered into several feuding factions, including 
Kach, Kahane Chai, Yeshiva of the Jewish Idea and Yeshiva of the Temple Mount. 
</P>
<P>
 But David Axelrod, spokesman for Kahane Chai, said his group was already 
operating secretly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not just underground, but we will operate from jails," he boasted in a 
telephone interview with state-run Israel Radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the Cabinet authorized the detention without trial of five 
leaders from Kach and Kahane Chai, including Marzel, restrictions on the 
movements and activities of 18 more members and the disarming of some settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cabinet acted under a 1948 law originally drafted by the British for use 
against underground Jewish forces fighting for Israeli independence. The law 
was later employed against extremist Jewish groups, then against the PLO and 
other Palestinian groups. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Israeli sources, Rabin wanted the ban before leaving today for 
Washington, where his talks with President Clinton will focus on reviving 
negotiations the PLO on Palestinian autonomy.

COLUMN ONE; TARGETING TAIWAN FOR ARMS DEALS; THE INDUSTRIAL POWERS FLOCK TO 
THIS SMALL BUT WEALTHY NATION IN THE POST-COLD WAR PUSH TO SELL WEAPONS. 
COMPETITION HAS PRODUCED A BOUNTY OF RICHES BUT ALSO CHARGES OF CORRUPTION, 
EVEN MURDER.

<P>
 Early one morning last December, a fisherman found Capt. Yin Ching-feng's body 
floating in the sea off Taiwan's northeastern coastline, a huge wound 
disfiguring his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators concluded that Yin had been murdered, and they soon found out 
why: As chief of the arms procurement office for Taiwan's navy, he had 
threatened to expose a pattern of bribery in which arms dealers and retired 
Taiwan military officials, representing European companies, paid active-duty 
officers for help in winning weapons contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the homicide, eight Taiwan naval officials have been arrested, 
and officers as high as former vice commander in chief have been implicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Yin's murder underscores the intensity of competition here, and the growing 
importance of arms sales in the post-Cold War world, as the leading industrial 
powers battle for exports and contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is that competition more fierce than in Taiwan, whose $87 billion in 
foreign exchange reserves make it one of the world's richest nations. Moreover, 
its government remains transfixed by the need to defend the island from 
invasion from the Chinese mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 Selling advanced weaponry to such eager buyers as Taiwan has become an 
important element of foreign policy for the United States and other industrial 
countries. Arms sales make up a big part of post-Cold War dollar diplomacy -- 
and franc, mark, lira, pound and ruble diplomacy too. 
</P>
<P>
 Freed of the need to join ranks against the Soviet Union and facing declining 
defense budgets at home, U.S. and European defense companies are competing to 
sell warplanes and frigates, tanks and submarines. And their governments, 
having overcome whatever reluctance they might have had about spreading deadly 
conventional weapons around the world, are lending a helping hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cold War system ended, and the defense companies in the West faced 
shrinking defense budgets," said Ding Shou-chung, a prominent member of 
Taiwan's legislature. "Their markets at home were shrinking. Before, there were 
limits on selling weapons to Taiwan. But the companies pressured their 
governments to reduce the limits." 
</P>
<P>
 While Yin's murder may be unique, the broader procurement scandal is not. 
South Korea's armed forces, for example, have been in the midst of similar 
upheavals, beset by allegations of corruption and waste in contracts for 
foreign weapons systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition to sell arms has raised questions about whether governments 
such as Taiwan's are being persuaded to buy more than they need. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to France, and they received me royally," said Wei Yung, chairman of 
the Taiwanese legislature's foreign affairs committee. "The Mirage is a 
beautiful aircraft. But it's too expensive. They cost $50 million apiece. . . . 
For every aircraft, you could start a new university on Taiwan." 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan is even being urged to buy new tanks, although it is an island whose 
only potential threat comes from the air or water. Taiwan's armed forces would 
probably either repel an invasion at the outset or lose the war. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, Taiwan relied almost entirely upon the United States for its 
arms. Military officials received U.S. supplies and training and even many 
perks that American officers enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1979, the United States severed diplomatic ties and broke its mutual 
defense treaty with Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the 1980s, Taiwan coped and tried to diversify, but other countries 
were willing to sell it only a limited amount of military hardware. 
</P>
<P>
 No one, including the United States, wanted to offend the People's Republic of 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, President Ronald Reagan, whom Taiwan had considered its strongest 
friend in U.S. politics, signed a communique with Beijing in which the United 
States pledged to phase out its arms sales to Taiwan, which had reached a high 
of $830 million in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan's star rose again as China's fell in 1989. After the deadly crackdown 
on pro-democracy demonstrations at Tian An Men Square, Beijing's ties to 
Western countries became frosty, and governments in Europe and the United 
States imposed restrictions on military sales to China. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tian An Men gave Western countries the excuse to have a freer hand" in 
selling arms to Taiwan, one Taiwan defense source said. And, he noted, Taiwan's 
ability to buy arms overseas was given an even bigger boost by the breakup of 
the Warsaw Pact and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, which reduced the 
market for advanced weaponry in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 In Taiwan, which spent about $8 billion, or 5% of its gross domestic product, 
on defense in 1989, top military leaders hurriedly switched the focus of their 
strategy -- de-emphasizing research and development of Taiwan's own weapons 
systems and stressing instead the procurement of advanced hardware from 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 France became the pioneer in launching the new era. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1991, French officials were making frequent visits to Taipei. 
</P>
<P>
 They broke the ice with a multibillion-dollar contract to sell six 
Lafayette-class light frigates to the Taiwan navy. And France offered other 
advanced weapons systems up to and including the Mirage jet fighter, a plane 
far more sophisticated than any being used at the time by Taiwan's air force. 
</P>
<P>
 A French source said the change in France's arms policy was approved by 
top-level officials in Paris, with Dassault, the company that makes the Mirage, 
actively lobbying for permission to sell to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Europeans followed suit. The Germans offered minesweepers, and the 
Belgians hawked rocket guidance and propulsion systems. British, Italian and 
even Russian military officials and contractors began prospecting in Taipei. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan was flattered by the attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "For decades, the United States was the only supplier of weapons to our 
country," said Huang Huang-hsiung, an opposition legislator on the 
legislature's defense committee. "Sometimes, I felt the United States' attitude 
was very harsh, very tough. With the European countries, we felt more respected 
and friendly." 
</P>
<P>
 The Europeans were a bit more cynical about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense contractors began to offer "commissions" for weapons sales. This was 
particularly the case, one European businessman confided, in instances where 
the military need for a company's wares was not so obvious and where Taiwan 
military officials could help get the required defense budget allocations. 
</P>
<P>
 The European arms dealer said he believed that Taiwan was becoming as corrupt 
as "Shanghai in the 1940s. . . . It's so easy (to sell arms) now. And sometimes 
it doesn't even take money. All it takes is some girls in Paris." 
</P>
<P>
 Europeans are not constrained by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which 
makes it illegal for U.S. companies to pay commissions or other fees to land 
contracts. In Taiwan, some defenders of this system of cash payments insist 
that it is the normal way of doing business on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're in the military and I win a contract, I may give you something as a 
gift -- some money," explained a Taiwan employee of a Western defense 
contractor, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. "It's not a 
bribe. That's just the way it is here." 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan's Nationalist government would not permit anyone in its National 
Defense Ministry to be interviewed for the record on the procurement scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Because officials in Taiwan had relied for so long on the United States as 
their sole arms supplier, they had little experience in handling competition 
for arms sales. And because most Western governments do not recognize Taiwan, 
it would have had a difficult time setting up a formal, 
government-to-government military procurement system even if it had tried. 
</P>
<P>
 So a shadowy subculture emerged in Taipei of foreign defense companies and 
retired Taiwan military officials, all working on arms deals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The value of (arms) procurement became higher and higher, and so did the 
profits," one retired Taiwan general explained. "That's why people retired" 
from the military. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan's legislature was in no position to serve as a restraint on this 
procurement system. Only recently has it had any power. Until three years ago, 
many of its legislators were elderly retainers holding permanent seats that -- 
in a weird fiction Taiwan has since abandoned -- claimed to represent districts 
on the Chinese mainland, which they had not seen since the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after the legislature was strengthened and made democratic, Taiwan's 
elected legislators found it impossible to scrutinize arms procurement. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we saw on the budget books was a name (of an arms deal) and a number," 
Ding said. "Anything more than that, the Defense Ministry said was secret." 
</P>
<P>
 From 1990 until today, Taiwan spent about $10 billion on weapons procurement, 
Ding estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been getting quite a lot of defense items," Taiwan Foreign Minister 
Frederick Chien said in a recent interview. "When everything is in place, our 
defense position will be one that is quite adequate." 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose, Chien said, is to assure investors that Taiwan has the capacity 
to defend itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan's burst of spending for arms had a significant impact on the behavior 
of foreign governments. In 1992, about half of all French arms sales overseas 
went to Taiwan. And by that year, the pressure from France and other European 
competitors helped to bring about a major change in U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of his reelection campaign, President George Bush announced that 
his White House was opening the way for the sale of 150 American F-16 warplanes 
to Taiwan, a transaction worth about $6 billion for General Dynamics (now 
Lockheed). 
</P>
<P>
 Over the previous decade, Taiwan had repeatedly sought permission to buy those 
planes, only to be turned down on grounds that the sale might violate Reagan's 
1982 agreement with China. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush Administration officials argued that the sale did not violate the 
agreement because the F-16s merely replaced Taiwan's increasingly outmoded 
airplanes. But later that year, Taiwan bought 60 French Mirages, thus reducing 
its reliance upon the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. companies, spurred on by the F-16 sale, have been urging Congress to 
adopt a new provision sponsored by Sen. Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska) that 
would guarantee that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan would not be restricted by the 
agreement between the Reagan Administration and China. 
</P>
<P>
 The provision, which has already been adopted by the Senate, would open the 
way for unlimited U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Soviet Union is no longer a threat, and the defense industry doesn't have 
what it used to," said David Laux, head of the U.S. trade group that promotes 
business links with Taiwan. "Here's this one rich customer, Taiwan, and we 
can't sell them what we want because we have to please this pariah, the 
People's Republic of China. . . . It just doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
 The widely publicized sales of the F-16s and Mirages attracted still more arms 
dealers to Taipei, offering more commissions and putting more retired generals 
and admirals on their payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
 "This corruption problem is universal," one retired Taiwan general said, 
sighing. "Everyone wants to buy something for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 He added hastily, "Of course, I hate corruption." 
</P>
<P>
 So did Yin, the Taiwan navy captain, who last fall had apparently decided to 
do something about it. He was, by all accounts, a sincere, dedicated officer, 
high-ranking enough to be chosen last fall to testify at a legislative hearing 
about changing the way Taiwan buys its weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 His murder is still under investigation, but prosecutors here believe that he 
was killed as he was preparing to expose a system of covert payments for arms 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, prosecutors found an audiocassette made by Yin discussing the 
payments and showing that he was not involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan's Defense Ministry announced last month that it had uncovered a series 
of bribes paid to navy officers in the purchase of weapons systems from French 
and German companies. 
</P>
<P>
 One navy captain who was a colleague of Yin's has admitted taking a bribe of 
about $360,000 from a Taiwan arms dealer who was the agent for the French 
defense contractor Thomson, the Defense Ministry said. Seven other navy 
officers and four Taiwan arms dealers, three of them former navy officials, 
have also been arrested in what is by far the most serious scandal to hit 
Taiwan's national security apparatus since 1985, when top-ranking intelligence 
officials were implicated in the California murder of writer Henry Liu. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the arrests, Taiwan is scrutinizing all its arms purchases, and 
legislators such as Ding and Huang are pressing for a complete overhaul of the 
country's arms procurement. 
</P>
<P>
 Yin's murder "is not a single case. This case is the tip of the iceberg," Ding 
said. "The procurement procedures are the same for the navy, army and air 
force." 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, seven Taiwan generals appeared at a news conference to 
apologize to the people for the procurement scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Asserted Gen. Shih Tsuo-ching: "The corrupt deals have not only dealt a 
serious blow to the image of the military, but have also hurt our national 
interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Mann was recently on assignment in Taiwan.

SCHOOL SCORES CAN MAKE OR BREAK A NEIGHBORHOOD; EDUCATION: REAL ESTATE AGENTS 
USE THE RESULTS. AND THE HOME BUYER GRAPEVINE IS IMPORTANT TO PROPERTY VALUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They may be subjective, they may be arcane, they may not even be right. But 
for a pinched little pile of numbers, the new school assessment scores have, as 
usual, packed a mighty punch. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hermosa Beach, Cathy McCurdy, school board member and mom, could not wait 
to show off. "D'ja see the scores?" she called to people along funky Pier 
Avenue. "D'ja see the scores?" she asked the Kiwanis Club. 
</P>
<P>
 They had. In fact at the Kiwanis luncheon, as McCurdy anted up a requisite 
"Happy Dollar" to the club pot, the Hermosa Beach city school district's scores 
in the California Learning Assessment System got a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 For too long, the city had struggled to throw off its reputation as a singles' 
sort of town. Now, it seemed, McCurdy's hometown was poised at an image-making 
moment: Its school district had scored among the county's best. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cerritos, where Whitney Junior-Senior High School rated No.1 in almost 
every subject area gauged, real estate agent Greta Aqui was smiling and smug. 
The questions may have been broadened, the test's name may have changed, but 
her local school, as usual, came out on top. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, she sold a dog of a property, three teeny bedrooms with a vinyl 
-- vinyl! -- pool for $285,000, based on its proximity to the coveted Whitney 
school, which takes only the best students in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't even know if their kids will test into the school," Aqui 
marveled. "They buy anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Life, she cooed, is sweet for the real estate agent who can boast: "Walk to 
Good Schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile in Brentwood, Carole Schiffer was, as usual, putting the latest test 
scores in her clip-and-save pile for use as a preemptive strike. She, too, is a 
real estate agent, but her market falls into that terrifying turf that her 
colleagues only whisper about -- Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that some of the state's best schools are in the district, and that 
educators chide that a good student will learn anywhere. The home buyer 
grapevine has it that the district is a ticket to Stupidville and a resale 
"Don't." 
</P>
<P>
 For her, the test scores are a form of early disclosure, like letting the 
buyer know right off that an ax murder occurred two doors down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We acknowledge that fear and concern, and they see we have nothing to hide," 
Schiffer said solemnly. 
</P>
<P>
 To many Californians, the periodic rite of school assessment is an esoteric 
exercise that seems mostly to yield reams of box scores for a game they are not 
sure they understand. This year's edition did not make things easier: In an 
effort to better reflect actual achievement, the tests were changed, toughened 
and renamed, but the new numbers are even more confounding than the old ones. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lexicon of modern parenthood, the number of points your child's school 
scores on what used to be called the CAP test, and is now called the CLAS test, 
is a crucial statistic, right up there, say, with hours of labor and the square 
footage of your house. 
</P>
<P>
 What percentage of your child's classmates passed muster in reading, writing, 
math? Were the scores better or worse than the year before? And then there are 
the extra credit questions: Does this mean you should shell out the money for a 
private school? Or sell out and move to a "better" district? Or just stew about 
it and consider the value of bedtime stories by, say, De Tocqueville instead of 
Dr. Seuss? 
</P>
<P>
 In the palm-lined suburbs of Southern California, an entire mythology has 
sprung up around what constitutes a "good" neighborhood, real estate agents 
say, and to the extent that there is a backbone to that pecking order, it is 
the school assessment test. Any home shopper can tell you that the South 
Pasadena schools routinely score higher than those across the Pasadena city 
line, and that the Westside school scores leap for the sky as you cross the 
boundary into Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Any real estate agent is well versed in the argument that you actually save 
money by paying more for a house in a "good" school district because mortgage 
interest is tax deductible, but private school tuition is not. 
</P>
<P>
 So never mind that, under the new and improved tests, it takes a good 20 
minutes and a calculator to gauge the effectiveness of your neighborhood 
school. In the rarefied world of parents-with-school-aged-children, the CLAS 
scores have become Topic A. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schools are just a real vital part of what makes a community," said Rick 
Learned, who owns a lumber store in downtown Hermosa Beach. For too long, he 
and other families in the sleepy beach community complained, Hermosa Beach had 
a reputation as a single person's town, a funky outpost of surfboard shops and 
biker bars. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a place to date, maybe, but not to mate, a place where the majority 
rented rather than owned. A lot of things came to mind when someone mentioned 
Hermosa Beach, but the public school system was not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The schools have been good for a long time," Learned said, "but the 
recognition has been a long time coming. . . . I think this will cause a lot of 
people to view us better than they did before." He added: "I know that the big 
thing real estate agents sell about an area are the schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Broadhurst, a real estate broker in Hermosa Beach, has already begun to 
picture the possibilities. Until now, she said, South Bay home buyers usually 
had two locales in mind if they had school-age children -- the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula and Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "People would sacrifice lot size, or move from a two-bathroom to a 
one-bathroom house, just to get into the Manhattan Beach schools," Broadhurst 
said. "Now, people will come in saying: 'I want to live in the Hermosa Valley 
section of Hermosa Beach because it's beautiful and quaint and a block away 
from one of the best schools in the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Broadhurst and others say that aside from the CLAS scores (or the CAP scores 
in years past), it is hard to say how a "buzz" develops singling out one school 
district from others that are equally good. Yet even newcomers to Southern 
California often choose their neighborhood based on the grapevine grading 
system that has sprung up to help parents pick the best school for their money 
when they buy a house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't seem to be based on much factual information," said Teresa Howe, 
director of relocation services for Jon Douglas Co. real estate. "It's water 
cooler talk. People will move here saying, 'We hear the Las Virgenes school 
system is good,' but they won't know much more than that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have companies Downtown where everybody (from out of state) will want to 
end up in Santa Monica," she said. "Why Santa Monica? Why not some other place 
with good schools? Well, a lot of times, it will be just the boss saying, well, 
'My kid goes to school in Santa Monica,' and people feeling pressure to follow 
the boss." 
</P>
<P>
 In Cerritos, Aqui said she has clients from other countries who have asked her 
to call the moment she gets a property in the highly regarded ABC Unified 
school district, especially if it is near Whitney High. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter what the house looks like," she said. "I put Whitney High 
School (on the listing) and boy, it sells real fast." 
</P>
<P>
 But Schiffer in Brentwood said she tries to encourage her clients to ignore 
the conventional wisdom and make their own decision about schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually tell them that I went to Hamilton High, which, when I started 
there, was one of the top-rated schools in the country," she said. "Then it 
went in the toilet, then it came back, then it went up and down again and -- 
well, I tell them, look at how I turned out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually," she said, "we end up laughing."

BREAST IMPLANT LITIGANTS CLOSER TO $4-BILLION DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Significant progress was made this weekend toward a record-setting 
$4.2-billion settlement to compensate thousands of women claiming injuries from 
silicone breast implants, according to attorneys for the women and three major 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a done deal," said a representative of one company, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. Negotiators met over the weekend in Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 Another defense lawyer and attorneys for the women made similar comments, 
although they were not quite as definite. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made terrific progress with the Big Three and some of the smaller 
defendants," said attorney Stanley Chesley of Cincinnati, one of five plaintiff 
lawyers involved in the negotiations. The Big Three he was referring to are Dow 
Corning Corp., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Baxter Health Care Corp., the three 
chief distributors of the implants. 
</P>
<P>
 A $4.2-billion settlement would be twice as large as any settlement of a civil 
case in U.S. history, according to legal experts. 
</P>
<P>
 The money would provide funds to settle silicone implant litigation worldwide 
over the next 30 years. For the plaintiffs, the settlement would compensate 
women for a wide range of medical problems, with the amount of compensation 
depending on the severity of injury. For the defendants, it would erect a 
partial ceiling on liability for companies participating in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Two major defendants, 3M and General Electric Co., have not joined the 
tentative settlement, according to Chesley and Michael Gallagher, a Houston 
lawyer who is on the plaintiffs' negotiating committee. 
</P>
<P>
 At a court hearing in Birmingham on Friday, U.S. District Judge Sam E. Pointer 
Jr., who is presiding over the thousands of breast implant suits represented in 
this negotiation, expressed concern that a tentative settlement disclosed in 
September had not come to fruition, and a March 8 deadline that he had set for 
a final version of an accord had come and gone. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday afternoon, Pointer directed representatives of the companies and the 
plaintiffs to stay in Birmingham until they had drafted a deal. Lawyers worked 
late into the night Friday and Saturday, concluding their sessions at 2 a.m. 
Sunday, according to sources on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 They gave the judge a copy of their draft agreement Sunday morning, and are to 
meet with him Wednesday. Any deal would have to be approved by Pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 One major point that has been resolved, according to lawyers on both sides, is 
how Dow Corning's share of the settlement -- more than $2 billion -- would be 
guaranteed. Dow Corning is jointly owned by Dow Chemical Co. and Corning Inc., 
and there have been questions about what role those parent companies would play 
in funding the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Dow Corning was the world's largest maker of silicone breast implants until it 
stopped manufacturing them in 1992. The Midland, Mich., company also supplied 
silicone gel to many other implant makers for decades. The company said in 
January that it had been named as a defendant in more than 6,800 lawsuits 
relating to silicone breast implants. 
</P>
<P>
 Use of the implants was restricted by the Food & Drug Administration in 1992 
after mounting complaints by women and after new information raising questions 
about implant safety was revealed in civil lawsuits. It is estimated that about 
1 million women worldwide have breast implants. Lawyers on both sides have no 
clear idea how many women would file claims if the settlement is approved. 
About 12,000 lawsuits have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Dow guarantee has been satisfactorily taken care of," Gallagher said. He 
said escrow accounts would be set up and other mechanisms put in place to make 
sure that the funds would be available. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very pleased about that development," said Sybil N. Goldrich of Beverly 
Hills, co-founder of the Command Trust Network, a nationwide nonprofit 
information clearinghouse for women with breast implants. "I was quite 
concerned that the deal might fall apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Any settlement would have to be cleared by a plaintiffs' steering committee of 
17 attorneys, as well as by the boards of the three companies. The companies 
also have to notify their insurance carriers, which would have to foot a hefty 
portion of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, it was anticipated that 3M and GE would be part of a $4.75-billion 
settlement, along with Dow, Bristol Myers and Baxter. But snags arose as to how 
much of the package those two would fund. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources, 3M's desire to participate in the settlement was 
heightened considerably this month after a Houston state court jury awarded 
more than $30 million in compensatory and punitive damages and legal fees to 
three women with health problems stemming from breast implants. 
</P>
<P>
 3M's general counsel, Thomas Boardman, negotiated with Gallagher over the 
weekend, but sources said they remained far apart on how much 3M's share of the 
deal would be. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point the plaintiffs had asked 3M to contribute $500 million. Gallagher 
said Sunday that they were now asking for less, but declined to say how much. 
Nor would he say how much 3M offered in the weekend negotiations, but it was 
previously reported that the company had proposed something in the range of 
$250 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our (position) is non-negotiable," Gallagher said. "They've had ample 
opportunity to come to the program. They have waited too long. They will become 
the focus of a separate class-action suit," Gallagher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still negotiating," said 3M spokeswoman Marsha Arko. She declined to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 One issue that has surrounded the breast implant litigation since the proposed 
global settlement surfaced in September was what portion of the money would go 
into a fund for the women claimants themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, there has been considerable criticism that victims of "toxic 
torts" have not received nearly enough of the money stemming from trial 
victories or out-of-court settlements. 
</P>
<P>
 RAND studies have noted that only one-third of the money paid out by companies 
in asbestos litigation went to victims, while two-thirds of the funds went to 
litigation costs, including lawyer fees on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Pointer said it was his goal to ensure that women get 75% of the 
settlement fund and that 25% goes for legal fees and other costs. That would be 
far more than claimants have gotten in prior settlements of this type. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not aware of any other large settlement where transactional costs were 
held to 25%," the judge said. "But I think there's a way to do it. I'm looking 
for ways to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge acknowledged that 25% of $4.2 billion "is a lot, but if we can hold 
it at that, we'll be doing well."

NEWS ANALYSIS; DOUBTS CLOUD PRESIDENT'S JOB CONFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was nearly a year ago that President Clinton and his senior advisers began 
kicking around the idea of hosting an international conference to figure out 
why high unemployment rates seemed to have become a fact of life in the world's 
industrialized nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The phrase "jobless recovery" was in vogue among American economists, who were 
trying to explain why the U.S. economy was bouncing back from recession but the 
number of working Americans was not. In ailing Europe and Japan, no one was 
even talking about recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Clinton opens the international jobs conference today, the increasing 
strength of the U.S. recovery and a steady decline in domestic unemployment are 
causing economists to question the usefulness of seeking global solutions to 
national problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, however, said in Detroit on Sunday that he will present a proposal 
today calling for efforts by Japan and Europe to do more to stimulate their 
economies through tax and interest rate cuts and other measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials, meanwhile, are struggling to lend an air of 
relevance to the gathering they dreamed up a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are trying to make it more of a low-key event than they originally 
intended. They don't feel as strong a political need," said Marvin Kosters, 
director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute and an 
economist in Gerald Ford's White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even if the political need has dissipated, the underlying problem remains 
perplexing. Many of the world's most affluent nations have found that the 
pursuit of prosperity has been accompanied by an unexpected and to some extent 
unexplained side effect: A growing legion of able-bodied men and women in 
Europe and the United States have either dropped out of, or been driven from, 
the work force and appear to have poor prospects of rejoining it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 24 most-industrialized nations of the world, about 30 million people 
are now without work. If all the developing nations are taken into account, a 
staggering 3 billion people are out of work or earning too little to live a 
decent life -- proportionally the worst global unemployment figures since the 
Great Depression, according to the United Nations' International Labor 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined unemployment rate among the 12 members of the European Union is 
nearly 11% and is expected to reach 12% by the end of the year. In the United 
States, unemployment has dropped to 6.5%, but government and labor officials 
say the overall rate understates the true extent of the nation's employment 
malaise. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of thousands of people have simply given up the search for work, 
dropping out of the labor pool and getting by on public assistance. Forty-six 
percent of unemployed Europeans have been out of work for at least a year, 
compared to 6% in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 With nearly 9% of American men between the ages of 25 and 55 not working, said 
Lawrence H. Summers, Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, "I 
don't think you can say we are without problems in the employment sphere." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a related phenomenon is causing increasing concern in the developed 
countries. It is broadly known as underemployment : highly trained workers 
toiling at jobs that require few of the skills they possess, and employees 
making do in part-time or temporary positions paying considerably less than 
they once commanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewed in this context, Administration officials argue, the international 
conference is needed to avoid go-it-alone policies that could send living 
standards into a collective downward spiral as individual nations try to take 
market share away from each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the United States is not Europe is not Japan. Conditions in each place 
are different. Embattled political leaders agree that they share a common 
problem, but they have been unable to identify acceptable joint solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 A strategy that could cause economic hardship on one continent might not on 
another; similarly, a remedy that could solve a problem on one side of the 
Atlantic might not work on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, political and social traditions that shape worker benefits in 
industrial France -- free child care and lengthy vacations, sickness pay and 
comprehensive health care -- have no history or little political weight in 
rust-belt Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference will be attended by economics, finance and labor ministers from 
the Group of Seven industrial nations: the United States, Britain, Canada, 
France, Germany, Italy and Japan. One key objective is to help political 
leaders determine the extent to which their unemployment problems are 
"cyclical" or "structural" in nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyclical problems are linked to the inevitable economic ebb and flow of 
recession and growth. While they cause real pain, history shows that relief 
will come with the next recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Structural problems, which appear to be increasing in scope, are attributable 
to fundamental, long-term trends that may be irreversible. Examples include the 
changes wrought by technology, permanent work force reductions designed to 
increase efficiency, ineffective education and training programs, the 
consequences of generous social programs and job creation disincentives such as 
high minimum wages and restrictions on firing workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials responsible for setting policy and spending priorities hope to hear 
what is working in other nations -- and perhaps what is not -- as they seek to 
create jobs in industrialized societies facing stiff competition from low-wage, 
low-skill developing nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials say the conference will seek to address several 
crucial questions: 
</P>
<P>
 * What has allowed the United States to race so far ahead of Europe and Japan 
in the recovery from the global recession that began in 1991? 
</P>
<P>
 * Can Europe cut back its expensive social welfare programs without courting 
the sort of political upheaval that few elected officeholders can withstand? 
</P>
<P>
 * Can the industrialized nations stitch together a comprehensive social safety 
net without overburdening businesses and individual taxpayers? 
</P>
<P>
 * Can Western nations and Japan increase international trade without 
triggering a protectionist backlash from vulnerable workers, companies and 
communities? 
</P>
<P>
 * Have technological advances and global competition permanently widened the 
wage differential between low-skilled and high-skilled jobs? 
</P>
<P>
 While Administration officials have high hopes for the conference, some 
economists doubt that it will produce tangible results. 
</P>
<P>
 A high-profile meeting such as the Detroit conference, said Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology economist Rudi Dornbusch, "makes everybody stand up and 
look good because they are concerned about unemployment." 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll say you have to reform, and be socially concerned and responsible in 
doing that, and the only way out is training," Dornbusch said. "But that 
anything should come out of it is a joke." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, senior Administration officials agree that the deliberations are 
unlikely to produce a "grand global initiative," observed Summers, adding: 
"This is not a conference that will produce an immediate take-home (benefit) 
for the unemployed auto worker in Detroit." 
</P>
<P>
 The skeptics say there is little likelihood that Europe will be willing to 
undergo the radical upheaval that conceivably could shake it out of its 
economic torpor. 
</P>
<P>
 An effective solution, they say, would require drastic changes in a hidebound 
social welfare system, a rigid workplace imposed by powerful labor unions and 
an inefficient investment structure that tends to deny capital to the small 
businesses that could create the most new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 For the United States, finding answers to the conference's central questions 
is more than just an altruistic exercise aimed at improving the plight of 
European workers. In the increasingly interconnected global economy, a thriving 
Europe is not just a competitor for U.S. businesses. It is a market. 
</P>
<P>
 * RELATED STORY: D1 The Workplace According to Reich 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of the Clinton Administration's international jobs conference in 
Detroit, U.S. Labor Secretary and economics author Robert Reich offered his 
assessment of the underlying trends affecting employment in the United States, 
Europe and Japan:  
</P>
<P>
 "Not too many years ago, the conventional wisdom was that Europe and Japan did 
it all right and the United States did it all wrong, and everything that could 
be learned, we could learn from them and, indeed, they had nothing to learn 
from us. Now, the new conventional wisdom is just the opposite: We're doing 
everything right, and Europe and Japan are doing everything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither of those positions is correct. . . . There's a great deal to learn 
from one another. Their job growth has not been very healthy, although those 
who have jobs have seen wage increases of very healthy proportions. The United 
States is almost the mirror image. Over the past 15 years, we've created a lot 
of new jobs, but . . . a majority of Americans have seen their wages stagnate 
or decline and many of their benefits disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 "The underlying question is: Are we condemned to choose between these two 
alternatives, neither of which is very appealing: either more jobs but 
declining real incomes and (a) widening gap between rich and poor, or fewer 
(but) better jobs with a bigger and bigger social safety net catching more and 
more people? 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be another alternative. . . . Some would say that in Europe and 
Japan they've done a much better job bringing the bottom two-thirds of their 
populations up to a high minimal level of competence in education and training 
and skills. Some would say that in the United States, our great strength is our 
labor market mobility, the dynamism and change that our markets allow."

<TEXT>
<P>
 TURNING AROUND: Crime is down by nearly 30% in Las Casitas, a neighborhood of 
540 condos in southwest Thousand Oaks (B6). . . . And city officials will 
consider a plan that could make the area even safer. The City Council will vote 
Tuesday on an agreement with the Ventura County Flood Control District to 
install fencing along a concrete channel in the neighborhood, a move that could 
keep out transients who camp there. . . . Mayor Elois Zeanah will present a 
report detailing efforts to turn the area around. 
</P>
<P>
 BERRY DEBUT: As Mickey Mouse is to Disneyland, so the Super Strawberry will be 
to the California Strawberry Festival. At least that's what organizers of the 
Oxnard event hope. . . . Auditions are set Tuesday in Oxnard and Wednesday in 
Hollywood for the mascot, which will make its debut at the festival, scheduled 
May 21 and 22. . . . Wanna-bes will be judged on how well they project 
personality while wearing tights and a giant red berry suit. . . . The mascot's 
mission is spreading cheer. "Hopefully, we won't scare too many kids," said Don 
DeArmond, an audition judge. 
</P>
<P>
 HOME BASE: The American flags flying everywhere provide an early clue. 
Catalina Heights in western Camarillo is not your standard-issue neighborhood 
(B1). . . . An extension of local Navy bases, the area is home to about 1,100 
Navy personnel from the Construction Battalion Center at Port Hueneme and the 
Point Mugu Naval Air Station. . . . The stay for some is short, but residents 
are bound by a sense of community. "Once you're here, you have everything you 
need," resident Marge Hays said. 
</P>
<P>
 HUENEME DAY: Port Hueneme residents voted for cityhood 46 years ago this week. 
Of 541 votes cast March 16, 1948, 338 residents of the military seaport favored 
incorporation, while 203 opposed it. An attempt to incorporate two years 
earlier had failed by a 30-vote margin. . . . The city's actual incorporation 
date is March 24, 1948, when papers were filed with the state.

AGING U.S. COPTERS SENT TO SOMALIA, PAKISTANI CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A senior Pakistani official Sunday charged that the U.S. military is leasing 
obsolete helicopters to the U.N. peacekeeping force the United States is 
leaving behind in Somalia, and he indicated to the visiting chairman of the 
U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff that without better equipment the entire mission 
could be jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news conference closing his 22-hour tour of U.S. and U.N. camps in the 
lawless Somali capital, Gen. John M. Shalikashvili said he will review 
Pakistan's request when he returns to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 He also confirmed that the eight AH-1S Cobra attack helicopters that Pakistani 
pilots will fly over Somalia under a $40-million U.S. rental agreement came 
from old stock in the Hawaii National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakistani Foreign Minister Sardar Assef Ahmed Ali told reporters that some of 
the Cobras have 45 minutes of flying time left before they are no longer 
airworthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Assef and Pakistani Defense Minister Aftab Shahban Mirani, during a visit here 
to celebrate the Islamic holiday Eid al Fitr with Pakistan's 5,500 troops, 
lodged their complaint with Shalikashvili and also urged him to provide 
additional air power to the U.N. forces, including scout helicopters and aerial 
surveillance equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shalikashvili said Pakistani officers, who will command the largest single 
force after the last U.S. soldier withdraws March 25, told him Saturday night 
that the equipment already leased will give them enough force to continue the 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-month lease includes 30 U.S. tanks and 80 armored personnel carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Assef's comments underscored a sense of bitterness and abandonment 
among the largely Third World armies that will stay behind after the United 
States and a dozen other Western and Middle Eastern nations withdraw their last 
troops from Somalia in the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are Pakistani lives worth less than those that come from the West?" Assef 
asked, referring to what he called the "outmoded and substandard" Cobra 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the pullout, ordered after the United States suffered high casualties 
in a firefight last October, could open the United Nations and the West to 
charges of racism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very dismayed by this," Assef said of the remaining peacekeeping force 
that will be almost entirely Asian and African -- among them the Pakistani 
force that arrived in September, 1992, months before thousands of Americans 
landed on the beaches of Mogadishu. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is beginning to look like Europeans for Bosnia, and Africans and Asians 
for Somalia," he said, adding that it "smacked of racism." 
</P>
<P>
 Assef said that if Shalikashvili and the U.N. Security Council cannot satisfy 
Pakistan's concerns, "we will have to take a very careful look at what sort of 
role we are going to have in the future -- and if we are going to have a role." 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, U.N. military officers said the Somali mission almost certainly 
will collapse if Pakistan, which suffered more casualties here than the United 
States, decides to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether he believes that the United States, which initially led the 
mission to save Somalia from famine and self-destruction, is abandoning the 
country, Assef said: "Life in America is very good. Nobody in America wants to 
die for anybody else's causes." 
</P>
<P>
 Shalikashvili gave the opposite message Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to hundreds of U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine personnel 
through a field megaphone inside Mogadishu airport's cavernous hangar, 
Shalikashvili said: "We all came here not because we wanted to get any credit 
for it . . . but for no other reason than to help someone else, someone in 
need. That's an awful noble thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I leave here with a very good conscience," the chairman told reporters at 
Mogadishu's heavily guarded airport moments before his Boeing 707 left for 
home. "I leave here thinking about the good things we have done. And I leave 
here with a guarded optimism about what lies ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 That optimism came despite spreading anarchy throughout the country and his 
own top commanders' assessments that lawlessness will increase after the U.S. 
soldiers leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Underscoring such concerns, two rounds apparently fired from a mortar or 
rocket launcher in the capital exploded at sea a few hundred yards from several 
U.S. warships and from the seaside headquarters of the U.S. commander, Maj. 
Gen. Thomas Montgomery, where Shalikashvili spent Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Army spokesman Col. Steve Rausch said it was unclear what was targeted. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his departure, Shalikashvili addressed fears that the U.N. mission -- 
indeed, the Somali nation -- will disintegrate after the U.S. peacekeepers 
exit, leaving behind about 1,000 American diplomats and civilians on shore and 
only about 50 U.S. Marines to guard them. 
</P>
<P>
 "You and I hope that after we're gone, the Somalis will put their country back 
together," he told the American forces. "No one can erase the good that you and 
your buddies did here. And for the Somalis, well, we can't guarantee their 
safety for the rest of their lives."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: THE BLUE COLLAR ROAD MAP TO A SECOND TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A cold, cavernous warehouse seemed an unlikely place for a Republican governor 
to formally launch his reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican candidates prefer outdoor rallies with bands and flags, followed by 
a civic luncheon with corporate executives and a country club reception during 
the cocktail hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Democrats go to warehouses with muddy entrances at the start of the 
morning shift. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was Gov. Pete Wilson last Tuesday, in a dark suit and white shirt, 
speaking to 200 or so steelworkers wearing boots and hard hats and sipping 
coffee from foam cups. Wilson said he chose the resurrected mill owned by 
California Steel Industries for his campaign launch pad because it is a 
metaphor for the entire, struggling state. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there is a stark reminder of tough times as one drives past acres of 
rusted buildings and discarded machinery, remnants of Kaiser Steel's 
once-gigantic operation before it folded in 1983. CSI, a Japanese-Brazilian 
partnership, bought some of Kaiser's facilities and began manufacturing steel 
products in late 1984. It flirted with fleeing the state, but stayed and 
modernized. Now, it employs 1,000 people and plans to expand. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the governor was given credit by management and workers alike for 
cutting red tape to expedite CSI's expansion. And that was another unusual 
thing about this political event: Workers and management sharing the same 
space, talking the same goals, muting the demagoguery. This is a non-union 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
 So Wilson's job rating at the mill presumably is much better than in the rest 
of the state. But that was not the reason he set up his podium here for the one 
campaign event he knew the news media would be obliged to cover. Nor was it 
really the metaphor for perseverance and success, although this fits nicely 
with his "California comeback" message. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor came here primarily because San Bernardino County -- the whole 
Inland Empire -- is a political battleground vital to his reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These are swing voters. They lean Republican, but switch and cannot be taken 
for granted. The parties are about evenly divided in registration. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino County went big for George Bush in 1988, then swung by a narrow 
margin to Bill Clinton in 1992. It voted heavily for Wilson over Dianne 
Feinstein in 1990, when Wilson narrowly won statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 So the play for a Republican candidate is to generate enough votes out of San 
Bernardino and similar counties to overcome losses in Los Angeles and the San 
Francisco Bay Area. Conversely, a Democrat must hold down the GOP vote here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Inland Empire's like the Central Valley in that it's a part of eastern 
California," observes George Gorton, who went to Redlands High School and is 
Wilson's campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many political consultants, Gorton views the state in terms of east and 
west more than north and south. Voters on the west -- living along the coastal 
strip -- tend to be better off financially and worry more about the 
environment. They're also more liberal on social issues. To the east, you find 
more "box lunch Republicans" -- as Gorton calls them -- and Christian 
fundamentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino County also offers what Democratic activist George Burden calls 
"the Bubba vote." In 1992, it deserted Bush and backed Clinton or Ross Perot. 
Burden, then the party's local field coordinator, predicts a huge plurality for 
Wilson if Democrats nominate Treasurer Kathleen Brown. "People are not going to 
support a woman out here," he asserts. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Joe Baca (D-San Bernardino) isn't conceding that, but says "she's 
going to have to come out here, be visible and pay attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown -- like all candidates -- will need to pay attention to jobs and crime. 
Both the unemployment and homicide rates here are higher than the state 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 "People here are primarily middle class and work hard for a living. Many 
commute for hours. Basically, they want to be left alone by government," says 
Assembly GOP Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga, who introduced Wilson at 
the warehouse. 
</P>

 "I like what he did about passing that 'three strikes,' " said one worker, Jim 
Love, 63, while noting that "a lot of people around here have bad feelings for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 But a younger worker told me his main concern is schools. "I got kids," said 
Craig Stevens, 43. "Schools were getting better, now they're going down again. 
You tell me, who 'n hell's going to pay for that 'three strikes?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson knows that if most Californians think like Stevens, Brown wins. 
However, he's betting that Love is more typical. And it's his kind that he came 
here to rev up.

BAY BRIDGE RETROFIT TO COST $250 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For more than 50 years, the double-deck San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge was a 
celebrated monument of structural engineering -- a testament that even without 
computers or modern testing equipment, engineering wit and instincts could 
fashion steel-and-concrete spans that would endure. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Oct. 17, 1989, when the 7.1 Loma Prieta earthquake caused a 50-foot 
upper-deck segment to collapse, killing one motorist. A 15-foot-long segment at 
the easternmost end of the bridge came within half an inch of falling, and 
other parts moved less dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 The bridge was repaired and reopened a month later, but retrofitting and 
strengthening it to withstand a much larger quake will cost $250 million. That 
amounts to about 40% of the $650 million that would be set aside for toll 
bridges if voters approve a proposed $2 billion state bond measure in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The next most expensive retrofitting job is set for the Richmond-San Rafael 
Bridge and would cost $125 million. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, retrofitting Southern California's two toll bridges is expected 
to cost far less: an estimated $32 million for the Vincent Thomas Bridge in San 
Pedro and $42 million for the San Diego-Coronado Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The other toll bridges needing strengthening are the San Mateo-Hayward, $95 
million; Carquinez, $35 million, and Benicia-Martinez, $55 million. Those 
estimates add up to $634 million, but the total is expected to increase. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the Bay Bridge safe to reopen in 1989, the deck sections had to be 
jacked back into place, secured with restraining cables and reconnected with 
bigger bolts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, that was not fixed for a big earthquake; it was just fixed to let 
the traffic go," Berkeley civil engineering professor Abolhassan Astaneh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Astaneh headed a team of engineers and scientists that recommended 
retrofitting and strengthening the two-mile portion of the bridge between 
Oakland and Yerba Buena Island. The goal was to make the span strong enough to 
withstand 40 seconds of shaking from an 8.3 magnitude quake on the San Andreas 
Fault to the west of the bridge or a 7.3 magnitude quake on the Hayward Fault 
to the east. 
</P>
<P>
 Astaneh said about 10% to 15% of the $250 million cost of strengthening the 
Bay Bridge would be for the steel superstructure. The deck spans would be tied 
together more securely and deformable steel supports would be installed at the 
top of concrete columns to absorb some earthquake forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the money would pay for rebuilding the bridge's piles and piers. 
Astaneh's team recommended replacing the timber piles driven into the bay mud 
with 100-foot-long, concrete-filled steel pipes. The piers would also be 
wrapped in reinforced concrete.

NEWS ANALYSIS; BOND PACKAGE SHAPED BY BUDGET, POLITICS; FINANCES: COMPROMISE 
PLAN WOULD PAY FOR BRIDGE WORK AND RESCUE HIGHWAY PROJECTS WITHOUT RAISING 
TAXES. BUT THE GAMBLE FACES VOTES BY LAWMAKERS AND THE PUBLIC. 
</P>

<P>
 In packaging a $2-billion earthquake bond measure for the June ballot, the 
governor and legislative leaders avoided a head-on collision with mounting 
financial problems that threatened to force a tax increase or shut down 
politically popular highway projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The eleventh-hour agreement to designate nearly half the bond funds for the 
strengthening of bridges most vulnerable to earthquake damage put off for this 
election year the necessity of a sales or gas tax increase to pay for roads. 
And it postponed the state's reckoning with at least a $2.5-billion shortfall 
in its transportation program. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, it solved a nettlesome problem for lawmakers in the San 
Francisco Bay Area who were facing a $560-million bill for the seismic 
retrofitting of toll bridges and no politically palatable way to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 For Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, the compromise package defused a potentially 
explosive campaign issue sparked by the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, which 
collapsed portions of six Los Angeles freeways and focused attention on the 
slow progress that Caltrans has made in strengthening the state's highway 
bridges to resist quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times special report last month found that about 80% of the freeway 
structures considered most vulnerable in an earthquake have not been 
retrofitted more than four years after the Loma Prieta quake sent 43 people to 
their deaths on Bay Area freeways and bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson Administration on Thursday announced a plan to accelerate the 
lagging retrofitting program by at least a year. Highway bridges would be 
strengthened by the end of 1995, while toll bridges would be fixed by the end 
of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Loma Prieta earthquake dramatically underscored the weakness of some 
freeway structures, Caltrans embarked on an ambitious program to strengthen the 
concrete columns that support about 1,300 freeway bridges considered most at 
risk in a major temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce the likelihood that the concrete in the columns will blow out when 
subjected to intense shaking, Caltrans developed a program to wrap the columns 
in steel jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the Northridge quake, the soaring costs of this seismic 
strengthening program threatened to gobble up scarce dollars from other 
transportation projects. These include maintenance and safety repairs on 
freeways, widening of roadways and construction of highways, as well as 
improvements to ramps and overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have insufficient revenues you do begin to cannibalize," said Art 
Bauer, executive director of Californians for Better Transportation, an 
industry and local government lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the nonpartisan legislative analyst's office warned lawmakers that 
the state was $2.5 billion short on the revenue needed to complete a seven-year 
master plan for transportation improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial crunch was blamed on the recession, which reduced sales and 
gasoline tax receipts, and on the increased fuel efficiency of motor vehicles 
that has eaten into collections from the 18-cent-per-gallon state tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The analyst's office also said the defeat of a rail bond measure in 1992 and 
the transfer of transportation revenues to help balance the state's financially 
troubled general fund has contributed to Caltrans funding problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Without additional money, the analyst's office concluded, the transportation 
department faces sharp declines in spending on maintenance of highways and 
construction projects in the fiscal year that begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial problem would be aggravated, the analyst said, by the fact that 
"the existing seismic retrofit program . . . has suffered delays and is likely 
to cost more than currently estimated by Caltrans." 
</P>
<P>
 The analyst's findings reinforced Caltrans Director James van Loben Sels' 
assessment at a January meeting of legislators and transportation lobbyists 
that the highway program was going "off the cliff" next year because of 
insufficient revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Several key lawmakers and Wilson's Democratic challengers in the governor's 
race proposed tax increases to avoid the financial crisis, complete the 
retrofitting work and prevent the cancellation of new construction projects. 
But Wilson adamantly opposed increasing taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He feels a tax increase would just be fatal to an economy that's on a 
turnaround," Wilson spokesman Paul Kranhold said. 
</P>
<P>
 But faced with criticism that the Administration had not moved fast enough to 
prevent freeway failures in future quakes, Wilson needed a means to defuse the 
issue. First he announced the acceleration of the seismic program, and then 
came the announcement of the bond issue to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a sales tax increase had been used to pay for repairs after the Loma 
Prieta quake, Administration officials said the governor believed that bonds 
were the most appropriate way to cover costs associated with the Northridge 
quake and to strengthen freeways for future quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 H. D. Palmer, assistant director of the Department of Finance, said Wilson 
believes the economy is much too weak to support a tax increase. Palmer said 
bonds avoid a tax hike and allow the state to take advantage of exceptionally 
low interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a time when state economy is stabilizing, the last thing you want to do is 
choke off or thwart that potential economic recovery by saddling the state's 
economy with additional taxes," Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal that emerged from the closed-door negotiations with top legislative 
leaders included a concession from Wilson that made it politically attractive 
to the two top Democratic leaders -- Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco) and Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) -- both of 
whom represent the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Wilson had insisted that the $650-million price tag for 
strengthening all of the state's toll bridges -- most of them in the Bay Area 
-- come from tolls paid by motorists using the spans. Instead, the compromise 
calls for the cost to be borne by the bond issue, sparing Bay Area motorists 
that burden. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's backtracked . . . to get political support from Northern California," 
said Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar). 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said the move, if successful, delays the crisis in the state 
transportation program. "What he's trading here," Katz said, "is long-term debt 
as opposed to dealing with the problem today. He's making a political decision 
to go for a bond versus a sales tax, thinking that bonds are less onerous in 
the public's mind than a tax increase." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Katz said the strategy is a gamble because the bonds still must be 
approved by a two-thirds vote of the Legislature and a majority of those 
casting ballots in the June 7 election. If the plan fails at either juncture, 
Katz said, the state's political leaders will face the dilemma they have been 
trying to avoid -- deciding whether to delay new highway projects or approve a 
tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
 And the cost of the retrofitting program could grow significantly as Caltrans 
completes a review of an additional 1,500 bridges, many of which were deemed 
seismically safe but are being re-evaluated in light of the failure of bridges 
during the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of bonds to pay for seismic retrofitting of bridges is a dramatic 
departure from the state's traditional policy that highway improvements should 
be handled on a pay-as-you-go basis. 
</P>
<P>
 After the governor and the legislative leadership announced their compromise 
bond proposal, critics were quick to raise questions about the new policy 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a political standpoint this is a deft compromise, but from a policy 
standpoint it is a disaster," said Senate Transportation Committee Chairman 
Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have estimated that over the 20-year life of the bonds, debt service 
will cost an additional $1.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) and Katz complained that in the leadership's 
zeal to solve a political problem, they had put forth a proposal that would not 
only increase costs but saddle future generations with mammoth debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see no rationale for this except politics," said Hayden, who is running for 
governor. "In order to keep the expansion of interchanges and off-ramps rolling 
. . . they had to find this new source of money for seismic so that it didn't 
compete with the new projects."

FACING DOWN FEAR; POLICE HOPEFULS UNDETERRED BY SLAYINGS OF OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 No cop joins the force thinking it will happen to him or her. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the past year, nine law enforcement officers in Southern California 
have been slain in the line of duty. Among the most recent: Martin Ganz, a 
Manhattan Beach police officer and former Buena Park Police Department Explorer 
Scout, and Christy Lynne Hamilton, a Los Angeles Police Department rookie. 
</P>
<P>
 With the images of sobbing police officers at Hamilton's funeral still fresh 
in their minds, some teen-agers who dream of becoming cops are stopping to 
think about the dangers -- and deciding that the job is still worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Heredia, a 19-year-old traffic division intern in the Westminster Police 
Department, said he knows that somewhere a bullet might have his name on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've thought about it," said Heredia, captain of his Explorer post. "But I've 
had this dream of being a cop forever. I know there's a chance I could get 
killed, but I don't want to give up my dream 'cause I'm scared of getting 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Connieann Sancheza, a 17-year-old Anaheim Explorer, has dreamed of police work 
since she was 7. Other officers have told her she will make a good cop, she 
said, because she is careful. Still, she knows that as an officer, "You may be 
able to retire, or you may not." She wants to take the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you think about it, you do start getting scared of going out there," 
Sancheza said. "But nothing is going to change my mind if I want to do 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 Police psychologists say that when veteran officers and deputies lose one of 
their own, especially someone they knew, they often take it harder than younger 
officers. For some, it may be the last straw. 
</P>
<P>
 But young cadets and people training to be police tend to see death as a 
remote possibility, say psychologists who work with police. 
</P>
<P>
 "A young deputy feels that if they're the good guy, well-trained, 
well-equipped and doing the right thing, they're in control," said Susan 
Saxe-Clifford, a psychologist who works with the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department and several police agencies. But in many of the recent slayings, 
"the officers had those things going for them . . . and it didn't help." 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Escamilla, a Buena Park Explorer, recalled that he got his first taste 
of dealing with fear and grief when teachers at the training academy played a 
dispatch tape of an officer being killed in a gun battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was to show us how scary it is," said Escamilla, 18. "And it could really 
change your outlook. We lit candles, and there were Explorers crying." 
</P>
<P>
 But Escamilla said he tries not to think about getting hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "These days, there's danger in every job," he said. "I can accept it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Explorer Scouts, an arm of the Boy Scouts of America that introduces 
youths to careers in law enforcement, attracts them for a variety of reasons, 
such as working outside and being part of a team, Explorers say. And there is 
the influence of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a cop," Heredia said. 
"Ever since I watched Ponch and Jon on 'CHiPS.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rosa De La Torre, a cadet with the Arcadia Police Department and a lieutenant 
in the Monrovia Explorers, said the attraction for her is the opportunity to 
aid children. And she knows that in doing it, she takes a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an Explorer, once during a ride-along our car got shot at," she said. 
"People out there don't care what uniform you wear, they just shoot." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she said, "if you're going to be a police officer, you have to go 
through (the fear). I like knowing you're going out there to help a family, and 
having the feeling you helped somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Alvarez, an 11th-grader at San Pedro High School who recently won a 
Los Angeles County leadership award for Explorers, said he is drawn to the 
profession because "most officers never let anyone else control their destiny. 
When they're out there, they just believe in themselves and go for it." 
</P>
<P>
 But the fallacy of that premise has become increasingly evident in the last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Compton police officers -- both in their 20s -- were shot execution-style 
during a traffic stop in February, 1993, and a Garden Grove officer was killed 
a month later. A Riverside County sheriff's deputy was killed in May, and an 
Oxnard police officer was shot to death in December. An Orange County sheriff's 
deputy was accidentally shot and killed by a fellow deputy on Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
 On Valentine's Day, two Palos Verdes Estates police officers were shot and 
killed during a seminar at a South Bay hotel. Then on Feb. 22 came the loss of 
Hamilton, slain by a 17-year-old who committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Such problems are not confined to Southern California -- three Boston-area 
police officers, including the chief of a suburban department, were killed in 
the line of duty in a five-day period in early February. 
</P>
<P>
 Shiloh Coleman, 18, said he understands the risks. And he still wants to be a 
cop. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman, 18, just landed a job as an Irvine cadet, a part-time junior officer. 
It means he can quit a job at the Price Club, but he said it worries his 
girlfriend because he is a step closer to making a dangerous job his permanent 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other law enforcement aspirants, he has a relative who was an 
officer -- an uncle. Coleman also has another reason for his career choice: 
"They need good cops. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be one of those officers that use community-based policing," said 
Coleman, a thin, soft-spoken Irvine Valley College student. 
</P>
<P>
 Heredia said he tries to put the danger of police work out of his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ninety-nine percent of the time, when you point a gun at a bad guy, they're 
going to stop and do what you say," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then, you never know when that 1% is going to hit you."

FIRST LADY VOWS TO PAY IF WHITEWATER TAX OWED; INQUIRY: MRS. CLINTON SAYS 
COUPLE WILL 'ACT APPROPRIATELY' SHOULD ANY OBLIGATIONS BE UNVEILED. NEW COUNSEL 
SEES NOTHING COMING OF CONTROVERSY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton said she and President Clinton are prepared 
to pay back taxes if it turns out that they underpaid on their Whitewater real 
estate investment, according to published reports Sunday. Meanwhile, newly 
named White House Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler predicted that the controversy "will 
turn out to be nothing at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Changing earlier plans for a TV appearance with the President this week, the 
First Lady gave brief interviews over the weekend to Time and Newsweek 
magazines as she prepared to resume her campaign for health care reform with a 
trip to Denver today. 
</P>
<P>
 She told Time that if information emerges that indicates she and her husband 
owe any back taxes in connection with the Ozark real estate venture, "we will 
act appropriately." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. News & World Report quoted White House "insiders" as saying that David E. 
Kendall, the Clintons' personal attorney, has told the couple that all he has 
uncovered are "tax errors and improper deductions" relating to the Whitewater 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine said Kendall "has assured the First Couple that as far as he can 
tell they have not seriously violated the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Reached at his law office Sunday, Kendall declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitewater controversy dominated the Sunday television talk shows, with 
Cutler appearing on three programs to defend the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" if he agreed with Kendall that the Clintons 
may owe back taxes and penalties, Cutler said: "All I can tell you is that Mr. 
Kendall is a very good private lawyer. . . . What the Clintons did in this 
investment some 10 or 12 years ago is a private affair of theirs in which 
they're represented by private counsel. This is not really a White House 
matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler described his new role as helping to deal with the impact of the case 
on the presidency and with making certain, "as President Clinton said when he 
asked me to take this job, that everything we do within the White House 
justifies public confidence in the openness and integrity of his 
Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his acknowledgment that he did not yet know all the details, Cutler 
defended the White House on several controversial issues, including the 
meetings that White House aides had with Treasury Department officials about 
their investigation into the failed savings and loan involved in the Whitewater 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Those meetings are being investigated by Robert B. Fiske Jr., the special 
counsel appointed to look into the Whitewater dealings and related matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is no one -- if I'm correctly informed -- no one in the White House 
asked that any change be made, and no change was made," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he had yet sat down with the Clintons and asked them to tell him 
everything they know about Whitewater, he said: "No, I have not. I have had an 
opportunity to meet with the President at some length . . . but I have not been 
into the details of Whitewater. . . . I think in the end it will turn out, at 
least as far as even a breath of criminal activity by either the President and 
the First Lady, it will turn out to be nothing at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation" if the President has told him whether he 
was innocent of any wrongdoing in the matter, Cutler said: "Of course, he said 
that to me. And I believe him." 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler also said on the CBS program that he is certain that the Clintons and 
their staffs will cooperate fully with any congressional hearing on the 
Whitewater matter, just as they are now cooperating with the special counsel's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Portions of some documents might have to be withheld for national security 
reasons, Cutler said, "but in general, when people in the White House, from the 
President on down, are asked about their personal conduct in the White House 
involving official business, they should cooperate, and I believe they will." 
</P>
<P>
 Calls for congressional hearings continued to come from Republicans, with 
Democrats just as adamant that they should be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 On ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley," Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.) reiterated his desire to have hearings soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the sooner we have that, the better it's going to be for . . . 
President and Mrs. Clinton," he said. "We can delay, we can stonewall, but 
sooner or later there are going to be hearings." 
</P>
<P>
 But House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said Congress should "respect" 
Fiske's request that there be no hearings until his investigations of the White 
House-Treasury Department meetings are concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been allegations that the Clintons lost less than the $68,000 that 
they have previously claimed from their investment in the Whitewater resort 
development in Arkansas, a partnership they shared with James B. McDougal, the 
owner of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, the failed thrift that is also part 
of Fiske's probe. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal has claimed that the Clintons invested no more than $13,000, although 
he has said he has no documentation of his charge -- a concession the First 
Lady noted in her 30-minute interview with Time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim didn't have any documents. He can recall only from his memory," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the Clintons have acknowledged that they improperly took tax 
deductions in 1984 and 1985 on interest payments actually made by the 
Whitewater partnership. They later filed amended tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal appeared on the ABC program and denied charges that any money from 
his savings and loan had been funneled into Clinton's gubernatorial election 
campaign in Arkansas in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a lie," McDougal said. "That's a Republican lie. . . . In no way, 
shape, form or fashion was any Madison Guaranty money put into a Clinton 
campaign. I'm prepared to go to court in the morning on that. Let's settle that 
issue. It's a lie." 
</P>

 But McDougal said Hillary Clinton had failed to supply him with old Whitewater 
real estate development documents that he needed to fill out his income tax 
returns. The documents have presumably been turned over to the special 
counsel's office. McDougal said he would be satisfied with copies of the 
originals. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he could guess why she had not sent him the documents, McDougal said: 
"I suppose there's possible embarrassment from some aspect of it . . . for the 
White House."

 SUCCEEDING MITCHELL: Sen. Tom Daschle, a "prairie populist" who chugs around 
in a 1971 Pontiac when he goes home to South Dakota, is the early favorite to 
win election as Senate Democratic leader when George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) 
departs at the end of the year. An energetic inside player and Mitchell 
protege, the 46-year-old Daschle is firmly in the Democratic mainstream and is 
popular with colleagues. "He listens, he's smart, he's a coalition-builder who 
is not seen as being out to score a lot of points at the expense of others," 
said one analyst. Daschle also benefits from the "small-state theory" of Senate 
leadership -- that senators prefer leaders from states with little economic 
diversity, so they can be free to work on national issues. . . . Sens. John B. 
Breaux (D-La.) and Harry Reid (D-Nev.) also are contenders but suffer from 
anti-abortion stances and more conservative philosophies. A dark horse to 
watch: Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.), the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee 
-- a savvy, genial sort with a sharp political edge. . . . The Senate Democrats 
will choose their new leader after the congressional elections in November.

 RALLYING 'ROUND HILLARY: Women's groups, led by the National Organization for 
Women, are springing to the defense of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton as she 
comes under mounting fire from Republicans and conservative activists. With 
only a few hours' planning, NOW organized a "zap" rally outside the White House 
and spun off mailings to chapters across the country, urging lobbying in 
support of the health care reform plan so closely identified with the 
President's wife. . . . "What we see behind these trumped-up attacks," NOW 
President Patricia Ireland said in an interview, "is that the Rush Limbaughs of 
the world can't stand a strong woman in the White House, but also the 
Republican leadership is looking for partisan benefits in the midterm 
elections, and they are trying to derail the health care reform package." Some 
of the assaults, Ireland said, "are as vicious as the ones against Eleanor 
Roosevelt."

 THE TITHE THAT BINDS: When he joined the House last year, he quickly picked up 
the nickname "Hunk" for his dark good looks. But lately, Rep. Dan Hamburg 
(D-Ukiah) has been a bit of a clunk, even as he seeks to expand his vocabulary. 
. . . Like many newcomers who ran for the House two years ago, Hamburg railed 
against congressional perks and pay raises. Assailing the Republican incumbent, 
Frank Riggs, for reneging on a promise to donate part of his salary to charity, 
Hamburg boldly told voters just before the election that he would "tithe a 
portion of my salary back to . . . the communities of the north (California) 
coast." Hamburg went on to win the race -- but guess who's reneging now? . . . 
Explaining why he won't fulfill his pledge, Hamburg says he never knew that the 
word tithe meant giving up one-tenth of his $133,600 salary -- and he needs to 
pay off a second mortgage taken out during the 1992 campaign. He says he is 
making contributions to charity but declines to specify them.

 BOSNIA ON THE POTOMAC: Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.) is an expert on Balkan 
politics -- and balky politicians -- in his dual capacity as chairman of the 
House Foreign Affairs Committee and head of a group seeking broad changes in 
Congress. "The politics of Bosnia," he laments, "are much less complicated than 
the politics of reforming Congress." PAUL HOUSTON

AMERICAN ALBUM: COLORADO QUIXOTE BUILDING HIS CASTLE IN THE AIR; BUT SOME 
FAMILY MEMBERS FEEL ROOKED AS FATHER DEVOTES HIS LIFE TO A DREAM OF TURRETS AND 
TOURISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN ROVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Toiling alone in a remote central Colorado forest, Jim Bishop has spent the 
last 25 years hoisting stone and hewing timber to construct a medieval-style 
castle that he never expects to complete, or live in. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Bishop wants to leave the castle -- crowned by a metallic 
fire-breathing dragon and 160-foot-tall stone spires -- to future generations 
as a monument to one man's stubborn individualism and resourcefulness. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidden behind evergreens on a 2 1/2-acre sliver of land he bought as a 
teen-ager midway between the tiny Rocky Mountain towns of Rye and San Isabel, 
the castle attracts 50,000 visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind, as the 50-year-old ornamental-iron worker says, that "nothin's 
plumb, nothin's level, nothin's straight" on his massive edifice. Tourists who 
clamber over and through the castle's buttresses, narrow spiral stairways and 
dark chambers liken the experience to stepping into a fairy tale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked up a little tree-lined path into a clearing and there stood this 
magnificent stone castle," said Marvin Smith, 61, a stained-glass artist who 
recently visited the structure. "I felt like I had stepped into a time warp and 
half expected to see knights on horseback ride up." 
</P>
<P>
 But the lord of this turreted citadel is a sinewy builder clad in a tattered 
plaid shirt and ragged jeans, his back now permanently bowed from laying more 
than 47,000 tons of stone -- all of it scavenged from surrounding gullies and 
roadsides. 
</P>
<P>
 Without pausing from his labors, Bishop will regale visitors with the story of 
his obsession -- provided they don't get in the way during tasks that include 
lifting stone and concrete parapets 120 feet overhead, or maneuvering 
wheelbarrows along eight-inch-wide planks suspended 100 feet above the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 For this is a work in progress, and Bishop is bewitched by his mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never finish it in my lifetime," said Bishop, who plans to begin work on 
a 13-foot-wide, 20-foot-tall stone wall that will surround the castle and hide 
secret rooms and passageways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year till I'm dead and gone, I'll be building that wall," he said as he 
shoveled a load of sand from his rusty, yellow 1974 Datsun pickup. "The castle 
is a weightlifting trophy. If you're going to lift weights, you might as well 
build something." 
</P>
<P>
 Lacking architectural drawings or a steady stream of cash to finance his 
dream, Bishop's progress is dictated by will, whim, weather and donations from 
enchanted visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bishop family turned the castle into a nonprofit corporation that accepts 
donations. They distribute a portion to charities and use the remainder to buy 
materials for construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "No books, no rich daddy and no bankers," said Bishop, who despises rules, 
regulations and bureaucrats. "Nobody tells me what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody needs to. Ideas tumble from Bishop's brain faster than he can lay 
stone, sprouting into features such as onion-domed turrets, bell towers and 
elaborate iron trusses supporting a massive roof of tempered glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Jutting from one gable is a 25-foot-long dragon's head, with scales formed of 
more than 800 steel plates salvaged from a local hospital kitchen. Its hinged 
jaw breathes fire 10 feet into the air, thanks to a set of propane tanks on the 
floor below. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop wants to suspend a bedroom from huge chains three stories above the 
main floor where, he said, "honeymooners, families, anybody can camp out." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to get even greater than that," Bishop shouted from his perch on a 
high scaffold as 50 m.p.h. winds whistled past. "I'm not easily satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and relatives agree and say that his devotion to the castle has 
exacted a painful toll on those closest to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop's youngest son, Roy, was 5 when he was killed by a tree felled by his 
brother in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 And Bishop's work at the castle has strained the loyalty of his wife of 27 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's so single-minded about his castle that he doesn't even hear what I say 
about other things," said Phoebe Bishop, 47. "I've ended up being the one who 
took care of everything at home and helped keep the (family) iron business 
running." 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop's oldest son, Daniel, 21, was more blunt: "It was his life . It took 
away a father from us." 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop sympathizes and acknowledges that his effort has gobbled up time that 
could have been spent with family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't go to the kids' high school games, and they've always worn 
secondhand clothes and sat on secondhand furniture. I've always been so 
concerned about where I was going to get my next bag of cement." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the way he sees it, "I'm only young once, so I regret every day that 
I'm not working on the castle."

KOHL'S PARTY DEFEATED IN LOWER SAXONY STATE VOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Germany's Social Democrats swept back into power in Lower Saxony state Sunday, 
dealing Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party a stinging defeat in the first of the 
country's 19 elections this year, German television said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a computer projection, the Social Democrats won 44.4%, just above 
its score in 1990, while Kohl's Christian Democrats slumped to 35.9% from 42% 
in the last election. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the worst result since 1959 for the Christian Democrats in the 
northwestern state, Germany's third-largest, and a weak start for the embattled 
chancellor in his uphill drive for reelection in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the day the twilight of the chancellor began in Bonn," said Green 
politician Juergen Trittin, the state's federal affairs minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Rita Suessmuth, Bonn Parliament Speaker and a leading CDU politician, said: 
"It is a bitter disappointment. It confirms that Bonn has had to make some hard 
decisions that did not necessarily appeal to the voters." 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl, chancellor since 1982, is trailing his SPD national challenger Rudolf 
Scharping in opinion polls that show voter dissatisfaction with mounting 
unemployment and the high cost of Germany's reunification in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain and strong winds kept voter turnout slightly lower during the day than in 
the 1990 poll, but chief election official Karl-Ludwig Strelen said turnout 
could reach the 1990 level of 74.6 %.

SERBS HALT SHELLING; RAID CALLED OFF

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. aerial gunships prepared to strike at Bosnian Serbs firing at French 
troops, but the raid was called off Sunday after the Serbian guns fell silent 
and bad weather obscured the target. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack order, coming less than two weeks after NATO planes shot down four 
Bosnian Serb fighter-bombers, demonstrated U.N. resolve to protect U.N. ground 
troops.But the decision to rescind the strike after the Serbs stopped firing 
also showed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization sought to avoid 
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi ordered NATO planes to attack Serbian 
positions near Bihac in northwestern Bosnia on Saturday night after a series of 
attacks on French positions, said Maj. Rob Annink, a U.N. spokesman. A French 
soldier was killed in the same area Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Annink said a Serbian tank had fired at a French armored vehicle, causing no 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 Two hours later, Bosnian Serbs targeted French positions with heavy 
machine-gun and antiaircraft fire.

 Colombians went to voting booths Sunday to elect a new Congress that some 
critics said was being bought by the powerful Cali cocaine cartel. 
</P>
<P>
 According to preliminary unofficial results, the ruling Liberal Party 
maintained control over the Senate.The party was also expected to keep its grip 
on the House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Turnout was reportedly low across the country. Final official results were 
expected late today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cali cartel, the world's main supplier of cocaine, is widely believed to 
have compromised many members of the outgoing Congress through bribery and 
intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebels kidnaped 31 election workers Saturday near Carcasi, 160 miles northeast 
of Bogota, army commander Gen. Hernan Jose Guzman said.

BOMB THREATS CLOSE LONDON'S AIRPORTS FOR 2 HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New bomb threats prompted authorities to close London's two major airports, 
Heathrow and Gatwick, for two hours Sunday night -- just hours after the third 
mortar attack on Heathrow in five days. 
</P>
<P>
 Scotland Yard said no explosives were found after the last warnings, which it 
called a "cynical ploy by the IRA to cause unnecessary confusion and fear 
amongst the public."The airports were reopened at 9:45 p.m. local time. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of airline passengers were affected. Many were diverted to outlying 
airports or forced to wait in terminals for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 12 mortar shells have been fired at Heathrow since Wednesday, all 
failing to explode. No one was injured although air traffic was seriously 
disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, one mortar landed on the roof of Terminal Four, used primarily for 
British Airways international flights, and three others landed nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish Republican Army, which had claimed responsibility for the first 
attack, issued a statement in Dublin, Ireland, late Sunday accusing the British 
government of ignoring its warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRA has targeted tourism in its campaign to force an end to British rule 
in Northern Ireland. It also is trying to pressure Britain's government to make 
concessions before the IRA joins peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Several news organizations received telephoned warnings about 90 minutes 
before the mortar attack Sunday morning, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 All flights arriving and departing on one runway were stopped for several 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, it had not been clear whether the shells were inadvertent duds or 
if they were intended not to explode. 
</P>
<P>
 But David Tucker, commander of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch, said the 
shells were loaded with plastic explosives and failed only because "there 
appears to be a consistent mechanical defect."

BAD NEWS ABOUT SCORES MEANS A WINDFALL FOR PRIVATE SCHOOLS; EDUCATION: 
INQUIRIES AND APPLICATIONS BEGAN AS SOON AS TEST RESULTS WERE ANNOUNCED. BUT A 
PUBLIC SCHOOL OFFICIAL SAYS IT IS 'VERY SHORT-SIGHTED TO THINK THE SOLUTION IS 
RUNNING.' 
</P>

<P>
 Phone calls flooded Los Angeles area schools last week after the new statewide 
test scores hit the streets, but parents were not calling their local schools. 
They were besieging private schools, seeking appointments and applications. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest blow to public schools contained in the disappointing test scores 
is proving to be a boon to private schools, which are waiting in the background 
whenever negative publicity afflicts the school system. 
</P>
<P>
 From the tony Marlborough School in Hancock Park to the lesser-known Halsey 
School in Woodland Hills, private school operators say the onslaught of upset 
parents began as soon as the test scores were released. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got parents coming in saying, 'I've had it. I'm fed up.' They just feel 
their hands are tied," said Ann Herman, the principal at Woodland Hills Private 
School, a small west San Fernando Valley campus with 110 students and an annual 
tuition of $4,240. 
</P>
<P>
 She was not totally surprised by the calls. "Very often when something comes 
out about public schools -- whether it's test scores or something else -- we 
tend to get a number of calls," Herman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Learning Assessment System test scores released Wednesday 
showed that most Los Angeles area students in grades four, eight and 10 are 
performing below tough statewide standards in reading, writing and mathematics. 
Even students at usually high-achieving schools looked weak on the new tests. 
</P>
<P>
 While public school principals and district administrators spent the week on 
the defensive, private schools quietly scheduled appointments, arranged for 
campus tours and mailed brochures. "I had one woman call asking about the kind 
of testing we do -- she wanted to know what kind of results we have," said Sue 
Fritsche, principal at Egremont School in Chatsworth, which has about 180 
elementary students and an annual tuition of about $5,000. "For those parents 
who can, they are looking for a better education for their children." 
</P>
<P>
 The test scores revealed that students in areas thought to have good public 
schools still did not score in the top ranges of the statewide standards. In 
the Beverly Hills Unified School District, half of the fourth-graders showed 
little or no knowledge of math concepts. In the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, more than 80% of the students in the three grades tested showed only 
a limited understanding of math. 
</P>
<P>
 "One assumes when you buy a house in Beverly Hills, a good education system 
comes with it," said Earle Vaughan, area manager for the Page Schools, with 
campuses in Beverly Hills and Hancock Park. "That seems not to be a guarantee 
anymore. All the indications public school parents get is that their needs are 
not being met and test scores prove that. They definitely affect the overall 
notion a parent has about public schools." 
</P>
<P>
 But public education officials say the answer to low test scores is not for 
parents to flee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very short-sighted to think the solution is running and 
jumping," said William D. Dawson, acting state Superintendent of Public 
Instruction. "The solution is to improve education for all students." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Dawson said he was not surprised that parents who can afford private 
school tuition are considering that option, he said the test scores should be 
seen as a wake-up call to public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you have to look beyond the test results themselves for 
everyone to see that schools need to improve," Dawson said. "We've got a job to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the high numbers of poor, immigrant students in the Los Angeles Unified 
School District, Supt. Sid Thompson said the schools are doing well, but he 
acknowledged that they need help. 
</P>
<P>
 "This district still does a damn good job," Thompson said. "If your youngster 
is motivated and you provide the support, we can provide a good education for 
them. If parents choose to leave, I think they're making a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Los Angeles school district has been anything but stable the past 
several years. District officials have faced unprecedented budget cuts, 
teachers strike threats and nasty political infighting. Schools have been left 
lean, without extra spending money and few enrichment classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous district crises led to the creation of several private schools now 
drawing parent interest. Halsey School, and Village School in Pacific 
Palisades, sprang up in 1978 during the bitter battles over busing for 
desegregation. Windward in West Los Angeles was formed in 1971 by Los Angeles 
teachers on strike that year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Busing made us a big-time thing," said Richard Halsey, owner and founder of 
Halsey School. "It was very disruptive for kids' education, but business-wise 
it was nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Only parents who can spend $2,000 to $12,000 a year on tuition can consider 
leaving public schools, but private school administrators say they have 
increased scholarship and financial aid programs because of the renewed 
interest in their campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past few years -- as the Los Angeles school district has faced new 
attacks to its reputation -- private schools have seen a change in their 
clientele. Barbara Wagner, principal of the 105-year-old, all-girls Marlborough 
School, said many parents today philosophically support public education but 
have become dissatisfied with the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It creates a new kind of parent who needs some education about independent 
schools," said Wagner, whose tuition this year is $11,700. "I think, as much as 
anything, this represents a more diverse parent body than Marlborough 
traditionally had. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest issues for these parents are safety, class sizes and a lack of 
individual attention," Wagner said. "Test scores are part of that, definitely." 
</P>
<P>
 Many private school administrators say they give students annual standardized 
tests but that they are not interested in trying the new performance-based 
tests given in the public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Though private schools are required to file annual affidavits listing 
enrollment and faculty information, they are not required to give standardized 
tests. Also, the state education code requires private schools to offer some 
basic courses but has no requirement for credentialed teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Rudd, principal at Pinecrest School in Northridge, said the 
performance-based tests used by the state are inaccurate and subjective. The 
tests require students to read passages and make comments on them, among other 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you measure feelings and opinions?" Rudd asked. "It really doesn't go 
hand in hand with achievement and measuring basic skills." 
</P>
<P>
 Most private schools use tests as one measure of their academic program and do 
not put a great deal of emphasis on them. They tend to give old-fashioned, 
multiple-choice exams of basic skills. 
</P>
<P>
 The new state tests for public schools are designed to complement a more 
rigorous academic curriculum in which students are given credit as much for 
their work in computing solutions as for right answers. But the results showed 
that public schools have a way to go, most educators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many private school principals appreciate the heightened interest in 
their campuses, they say they do not want to see the failure of public 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look upon it sadly," said Tom Gilder, the Windward headmaster. "Clearly in 
Los Angeles there's a market for private schools when public schools aren't 
successful. But it's very important to all of us to see the public schools 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Gilder and other private school administrators have formed a 
support group with public school principals to find ways to help each other. 
The group has set up tutorial programs for public school students, and the 
administrators hold monthly meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're only able to educate a small fraction of the student population," 
Gilder said. "It really makes us sad to think that our next generation won't 
have schools as successful as they should."

MAN DIES IN 2ND FATAL SKI ACCIDENT IN 2 DAYS AT HEAVENLY VALLEY RESORT

<P>
 A 31-year-old man has become the second person in two days to die in a ski 
accident at Heavenly Valley Ski Resort. 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado County sheriff's deputies said the man, whose name was withheld 
pending notification of relatives, was skiing fast down Rusutsu Run when he 
struck a tree early Sunday afternoon.He died of massive head injuries about an 
hour later at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the fourth fatality this season in Lake Tahoe ski accidents -- all at 
Heavenly Valley. All four died after hitting trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The man died one day after an exchange student from Scotland was killed when 
he went out of control on Lower Ellie's Run. Garry David Rogers, 18, who had 
been attending high school in Healdsburg, suffered massive head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are certainly asking questions about why four fatalities could happen in 
one season," Heavenly Valley spokesman John Wagnon said. "It's very odd to have 
four fatalities in a season, let alone two on the same weekend."

1 MARINE KILLED, 4 HURT IN CRASH OF TUSTIN-BASED HELICOPTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Marine officer was killed and four Marines were injured when their 
Tustin-based helicopter landed tail-first and burst into flames on a military 
runway in Northern California, the Marine Corps said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The co-pilot, Lt. James Amature, 27, of New York City, who had been involved 
in U.S. relief efforts in Somalia, died of massive injuries in the Saturday 
afternoon accident aboard a CH-53D Super Stallion helicopter, spokesman Sgt. 
Barry L. Pawelek said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pawelek said the transport and supply helicopter from the Marine Heavy 
Helicopter Squadron 363 at the Tustin Marine Corps Air Station was on a routine 
training mission. It was landing at the Mountain Warfare Training Center in 
Bridgeport when "the bottom two wheels of the plane, near the tail," hit the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopter burst into flames that "destroyed most of the aircraft," 
Pawelek said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the mishap has not been determined, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot, Maj. David Peterson, 40, of Fairborne, Ohio, was in satisfactory 
condition Sunday, said a nurse at Washoe Medical Center in Reno, Nev. No 
conditions were available for the others, identified as crew chief Cpl. John 
McCarthy, 29, of Randolph, Mass., and crewman Lance Cpl. Vincent Pirato, 30, of 
Drexel Hills, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Also hurt was Capt. Kerry Bartlett, who is attached to the Mountain Warfare 
Training Center, Pawelek said.

 State and local governments spent $884 million last year on health care, 
education, prisons and other public services for 345,000 illegal immigrants, a 
new report says.The report will be used to support a lawsuit Gov. Lawton Chiles 
plans to file against the federal government seeking reimbursement for services 
to refugees and illegal immigrants. The report, "The Unfair Burden: 
Immigration's Impact on Florida," is the first attempt by state officials to 
put a price on the services used by legal and illegal aliens. It was prepared 
by the governor's office and the Florida Advisory Council on Intergovernmental 
Relations.

 Organizers of Boston's St. Patrick's Day parade will cancel it to protest a 
court order allowing gays and lesbians to march."They're not going to shove 
something down our face that's not our traditional values," John (Wacko) 
Hurley, president of the South Boston Allied War Veterans Council, said at a 
news conference. Hurley said gay marchers will be excluded when the parade 
resumes next year. But Mayor Thomas M. Menino has said the city will sponsor 
the parade next year and will include the Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and 
Bisexual Group of Boston.

MALCOLM X WIDOW ACCUSES FARRAKHAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Malcolm X's widow said in a television interview that she believes Nation of 
Islam leader Louis Farrakhan was involved in her husband's assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Shabazz previously has criticized Farrakhan but never directly accused 
him of complicity in the 1965 assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 In a taped interview for broadcast Sunday on WNBC-TV's "News Forum," Shabazz 
was asked if she believes that Farrakhan "had anything to do with the death of 
your husband." 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, yes," she replied. "Nobody kept it a secret. It was a badge of 
honor. Everybody talked about it, yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Shabazz wasn't asked to elaborate. Telephone calls to her home went 
unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard F. Muhammad, chief of staff for the Nation of Islam, denied the 
charge, calling it part of an effort "to assassinate the character of, cause 
the false and unjust imprisonment of and incite the murder of Minister Louis 
Farrakhan and the destruction of the Nation of Islam." 
</P>
<P>
 Malcolm X, who had been the voice of the Nation of Islam under its leader, 
Elijah Muhammad, was exiled from the group in 1963. He subsequently came under 
verbal attack from other members. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan, who was recruited into the Nation of Islam by Malcolm X, wrote in 
the Dec. 4, 1964, issue of Muhammad Speaks, the organization's newspaper: "The 
die is set and Malcolm shall not escape. . . . Such a man is worthy of death." 
Farrakhan was chief minister of the Nation of Islam's Boston mosque at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Malcolm X was shot to death while speaking in New York City on Feb. 21, 1965. 
Three black Muslims were convicted of the murder.

COMMUNITY CLASHES WITH DAY WORKERS; NEIGHBORHOODS: LADERA HEIGHTS RESIDENTS SAY 
THE IMMIGRANT LABORERS ARE TOO AGGRESSIVE AND UNRULY. THE JOB-SEEKERS SAY THEY 
ARE ONLY TRYING TO SURVIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To Fausto Dubon and his colleagues, it is a question of survival: Seeking 
employment on the sidewalk sustains these men and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have a right to work in this world," said Dubon as he and a score of 
other men, all Latin American immigrants, solicited jobs from passing motorists 
on a recent morning. "We're not on welfare. And we're not bothering anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 To Willa Hector and other area residents, the issue touches on a fundamental 
theme: the survival of a tranquil community that they say is under siege from 
unwanted and unruly outsiders -- Dubon and the other 50 or so job-seeking 
immigrants who daily congregate at a neighborhood shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has to do with maintaining our neighborhood as a desirable place for us 
to live," said Hector, who has lived in the area for 17 years. "We don't want 
to let it be ruined by a lot of people who do not have any stake in the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus are the battle lines drawn in Ladera Heights, an upper-middle-class 
enclave of rolling hills, comfortable houses and tree-lined streets north of 
Inglewood. This quiet community has emerged as the flash point of the moment in 
homeowners' recurrent efforts to ban or restrict curbside hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the mostly white suburban communities usually up in arms about 
immigrant day laborers, Ladera Heights is a racially mixed, predominantly 
African American community. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is scheduled to 
consider an ordinance that would prohibit day laborers in Ladera Heights and 
other unincorporated areas of the county from seeking jobs near homes, schools, 
playgrounds or places of worship, as well as in some commercial parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the eve of the vote, there is some optimism that a less restrictive 
measure will emerge to resolve the often racially tinged clash, which in Ladera 
Heights has been building for more than a year. The compromise proposal would 
attempt to confine job-soliciting activities in the area to a corner of the 
parking lot adjacent to the HomeBase shopping center at Slauson and Fairfax 
avenues. As part of the package, immigrant advocates have agreed to pay for the 
installation of portable toilets in the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't been a good combination, having large numbers of men standing all 
day in a residential area," said Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, who 
represents the district and authored the restrictive legislation but now 
advocates a less-stringent approach. "This (compromise) situation should help a 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever emerges, the struggle has left a legacy of ill will in the community, 
where divisions between immigrant day laborers and residents run deep. The 
dispute illustrates the irritants that have frequently ratcheted up 
neighborhood tensions throughout Southern California in recent years, as new 
immigrants have drastically altered the region's demographics.  
</P>
<P>
 "What happened in Ladera Heights is symptomatic of what is happening 
throughout the country to a large degree as immigration and diversification 
take a larger hand in determining who's here, and who's part of society," said 
Joe R. Hicks, executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference of Greater Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The African American civil rights group has joined immigrant organizations, 
the American Civil Liberties Union and the Roman Catholic archdiocese in 
defending the laborers. 
</P>
<P>
 "These men are participating in a time-honored American tradition: finding 
work," Hicks said. "We should be celebrating that instead of attempting to 
criminalize it." 
</P>
<P>
 In Ladera Heights, an ugly, black-versus-brown racial undercurrent has emerged 
in a neighborhood that prides itself on its multiethnic character. Two decades 
ago, immigrant advocates point out with irony, long-entrenched white homeowners 
in Ladera Heights resisted the arrival of African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand that black people in the United States felt humiliated when 
they had to sit on the back of the bus, but now we're the ones being 
humiliated," said Adolfo Barrios, a Guatemalan who is a corner regular. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Cervantes, who coordinates worker issues for the Coalition for Humane 
Immigration Rights of Los Angeles, said: "I think there are elements of 
immigrant-bashing, along with people who don't like to see brown men on the 
streets looking for work." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners and Burke, the board's only African American supervisor, 
strenuously deny racial motivations. Rather, they blame the immigrants and 
their aggressive tactics -- the workers typically swarm toward the vehicles of 
prospective employers -- for a host of woes: creating traffic hazards, 
loitering, trespassing, stealing, harassing women and urinating and defecating 
on public and private property. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they were black I wouldn't want them there, and if they were white I 
wouldn't want them there," said Don Lopez, a Mexican American businessman who 
moved to Ladera Heights 16 years ago from the Eastside and is one of the most 
adamant opponents of the day laborers' presence. 
</P>
<P>
 To Lopez and many other Ladera Heights residents, anything short of ousting 
the men from the street corners is insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do we not have any say in what we want for our community?" asked Shirley 
Miles, a 10-year resident who is a personnel executive. "Or do we just let 
people who do not live in our community come in and take over?" 
</P>
<P>
 She was among a group of Ladera Heights homeowners, all longtime residents, 
who gathered in the rear of a sheriff's substation one evening last week to 
explain their opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a good neighborhood where folks care and look after each other," said 
Hector, a computer systems designer, extolling the district's low crime rate, 
family atmosphere and accessibility. "Even though we certainly empathize with 
people who are out of work, and we have no ax to grind with these people as 
individuals, the practice of curbside employment is not something we want to 
encourage or condone or even tolerate." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say they have been unfairly typecast as bigots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say this is a color-blind area," said June Ikoma, a Japanese American 
who has lived in Ladera Heights for 24 years and says she and her college-age 
daughter avoid taking walks because of the workers. 
</P>
<P>
 As in other neighborhoods, some residents view the laborers' presence as an 
unsettling portent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's spreading all over town," said Helen Kasparian, a retired schoolteacher 
and 30-year resident. Some women, she said, are afraid to visit her church, St. 
James Armenian. "(They) drive up and see all these Mexicans standing around and 
it's frightening." 
</P>
<P>
 From the workers' perspective, such talk is hypocritical at best, racist at 
worst. The area's residents, they note, are their primary employers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people didn't give us work, we wouldn't come here," said Dubon, 37, 
originally from Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to complaints, the men say they have largely confined their job 
solicitation efforts to the vicinity of a shopping center driveway. They have 
also developed rules designed to cut down or eliminate littering, drinking and 
other misbehavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The job-hunters -- typically commuters residing in Los Angeles or Inglewood -- 
are mostly Central American or Mexican nationals who have acquired permanent or 
temporary legal U.S. residence. Unlike denizens of some corners, they seem 
tight-knit: Recently, they pooled funds to help support a Salvadoran colleague 
who broke his leg in a traffic mishap. 
</P>
<P>
 In this fickle employment bazaar, cash earnings can range from less than $100 
weekly to, on occasion, near $1,000, depending on one's skills, dedication -- 
and, of course, luck. Roofers, brick workers, plumbers, tile men and other 
specialists do best. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most corner job-seekers have limited educations, Barrios, 27, is part 
of the university-educated minority. A stage actor in Guatemala City, his 
thespian inclinations got him into trouble there four years ago when his 
troupe's repertoire touched on politics, a sensitive subject in a nation riven 
by three decades of civil war. He fled north, leaving three children behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now they want to blame immigrants for everything that goes wrong in this 
country," said Barrios, who lost his apartment manager's job in January's 
earthquake. "It's a good thing the earthquake was an act of nature or they 
would have blamed us for that too."

SUMMER BLOWS INTO SOUTHLAND ON A SANTA ANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The calendar says it's near the end of winter, but the thermometer reads like 
summer Sunday as record temperatures 20 degrees above normal sent 400,000 
people flocking to Los Angeles County beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Pushed by gusty Santa Ana winds early in the day, the mercury rose to 89 
degrees at the Los Angeles Civic Center by midafternoon, breaking by one degree 
the record for the date set in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
 The high temperature in Santa Monica was only two degrees cooler than in 
Downtown. Along the sand from the Palos Verdes Peninsula to Malibu, lifeguards 
reported huge crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's summer down here," said Los Angeles County lifeguard Lt. Conrad 
Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
 From his vantage point on the Santa Monica Pier, Liberty figured 250,000 
people were enjoying the warm, clear beach weather from Marina del Rey to 
Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 At a lifeguard tower in Hermosa Beach, Lt. Bob Schroeder estimated that 
150,000 people were cavorting on the sand in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 With water temperatures only in the upper 50s and strong riptides near shore, 
lifeguards were kept busy, rescuing dozens of swimmers from the chilly water. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, skiers clad in T-shirts, shorts and an occasional bikini top hit 
the slopes at the Mountain High Ski Area in the San Gabriel Mountains, said 
lift supervisor Linda Catrone. 
</P>
<P>
 The warm weather was caused by typical Santa Ana conditions, said Bruce 
Thoren, a meteorologist with WeatherData, Inc., which supplies forecasts to The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong high-pressure system over Nevada generated gusty winds of up to 40 
m.p.h. at Ontario International Airport and 35 m.p.h. at Van Nuys Airport. 
Humidity levels dropped to the low teens. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco also broke its 1926 record with a Sunday high of 81 degrees, and 
Oakland's 77 degrees cracked the 75-degree high-temperature mark set in 1947. 
Sacramento's mercury hit 81, surpassing last year's record 78 degrees, 
according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather service said the temperature Sunday reached 88 degrees in Long 
Beach, 87 in Burbank and 86 at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said temperatures should begin to drop today, particularly along 
the coast.

<P>
 For the second consecutive year, a team of students from Taft High School of 
Woodland Hills claimed the mantle of California's best and brightest Sunday, 
winning the state Academic Decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taft team, representing the Los Angeles Unified School District, 
out-tested its Los Angeles County rival, West High School of Torrance, which 
finished second. Orange County's Laguna Hills High School was third. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft's win earned the San Fernando Valley school its fourth state championship 
since the contest began 15 years ago. The nine-member team will represent 
California in the national competition next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, we shook Stockton," said Taft senior Daniel Berdichevsky, 17, who took 
the gold medal for the highest overall score in the 10-event contest, earning 
8,937 points out of a possible 10,000. "I feel exhilarated." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was also a welcome back gift for Taft Coach Arthur Berchin, who 
had left decathlon training four years ago after leading the 1989 Taft team to 
the national title. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 70 Taft parents, friends and district administrators cheered as team 
members raked in 12 gold medals for individual events, 11 silver and seven 
bronze. The school scored 48,974 points of a possible 60,000; West High's tally 
was 46,278. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also a boost for the city's beleaguered school district, which fared 
poorly in state test scores released last week. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 375 students representing 43 California regions joined in the battle 
of brains that began Friday at the University of the Pacific. The first day 
included written tests in math, fine arts, economics, science, literature and 
social studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Students were back Saturday morning with essay writing, prepared and impromptu 
speeches, as well as interviews with judges. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sunday's awards luncheon, Taft students nervously twittered at the table. 
Team members Sage Vaughn, 16, and Sheldon Peregrino, 18, created sculptures out 
of their water glasses and lunch remnants. Rebecca Rissman, 17, parked her 
elbows on the table and wrung her hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is torture," Vaughn said. 
</P>
<P>
 When it came, the announcement could hardly be heard over the cheers of Taft 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're so proud," said Jill Shapiro, whose 16-year-old daughter, Kimberly, 
took two individual event medals for the team. "They're all great. We love them 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 West High coach George Floratos said he was proud of his students even though 
he was disappointed by the school's 0-4 record at the state competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of these times we're going to win it," Floratos said. "But Taft was a 
super team and a neat bunch of kids."  
</P>
<P>
 Also competing for Taft were Chris Huie, 17, who took home seven individual 
medals; Andrew Salter, 17, who finished second overall; Michael Michrowski, 17, 
who garnered three medals, and Stephen Shaw, 16, the team's only junior, who 
won four medals. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory means only a short break before they begin preparing for next 
month's national competition in New Jersey. "I think we get a few days off 
before we start studying again," Kimberly Shapiro said. "We only have a month 
left."

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I can be (and have been) cited for failing to come to a complete stop at a 
stop sign. Why do bicyclists seem to have complete immunity from this law? I am 
constantly seeing them zoom through stop signs without even slowing. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, two bicyclists sailed out of the cross street as I was about to 
pull away from a four-way stop, and one of them had the gall to hold up his 
hand to indicate that I should stop again. This occurred at the very 
intersection where I had been cited a few months previously. 
</P>
<P>
 Your thoughts? 
</P>
<P>
 Richard A. Pierce, Burbank 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Let your letter be a warning to bicyclists everywhere that they are not exempt 
from halting at stop signs just because they drive two wheels instead of four. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are susceptible to the rules of the road just like everyone else," CHP 
Officer Glen Dominguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 After stopping at the stop sign, though, bicycle riders have two options. They 
can cross to the other side on their bike with the rest of traffic as long as 
they do not veer within the lines of the marked crosswalk. Or they can join 
pedestrians and use the crosswalk -- but to do that, they have to dismount and 
escort their bikes across on foot. 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 In traveling through the Valley during the weekends, I have noticed that the 
freeway on-ramp control lights are in operation even though the freeway traffic 
is light. I have seen this on many of the on-ramps, but two in particular prove 
to be particularly annoying. These are the westbound on-ramp to the Ventura 
Freeway on Balboa Boulevard and the eastbound on-ramp to the Ventura Freeway at 
Topanga Canyon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 I was under the impression that the purpose of these lights was to control 
access during peak traffic times. I feel that they should be turned off 
completely during the weekends and on holidays. What can be done to eliminate 
the lights? 
</P>
<P>
 Murray S. Levine, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Your tax dollars at work: In response to your letter, Caltrans inspected both 
signals and determined that the Topanga Canyon Boulevard light is working 
properly. The Balboa Boulevard signal, however, might need an adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem you describe is caused by the way the signaling system is 
designed. Caltrans spokesman Russ Snyder said the signals are designed to sense 
traffic already on the freeway and to control the flow of cars waiting to 
enter. 
</P>
<P>
 The lights are supposed to shut off in the evening and on weekends. But if the 
system detects heavy traffic, it will turn itself on. Because it senses traffic 
downstream on the freeway, drivers farther away may not notice heavy traffic. 
</P>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the recent question (Feb. 28) as to who has the right of way if a 
police car, ambulance, firetruck and a mail truck all arrive at an 
intersection: 
</P>
<P>
 I am glad that it was established that the mail truck would not even be in the 
running, but I am disappointed that it was not pointed out that Section 21806 
of the California Vehicle Code makes that clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Section 21800 answers the question of which of the remaining three vehicles 
has the right of way. To make it short, the vehicle to the left of the mail 
truck has the right of way. 
</P>
<P>
 Since everybody has to yield to the vehicle on his right, whoever sees the 
mail truck on his right gets to go first. 
</P>
<P>
 Easy, huh? 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Rogers, Granada Hills 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds plausible enough, but there are a couple of caveats to add to this 
heady debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Your answer is predicated on the assumption that the police car, ambulance and 
firetruck are all responding to an emergency and have their sirens blaring. In 
that case, Section 21806 of the Vehicle Code indeed specifies that "every other 
vehicle" -- such as a mail truck -- "shall yield the right of way." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the remaining vehicles, though, it's harder to say exactly who has the 
right of way, partly because the rules of the road are largely suspended for 
emergency vehicles responding to emergencies. Technically, they do not even 
have to stop at the stop sign if it's safe to go on through, according to the 
California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 So if all three are rushing to emergencies, it may well be up to the 
dispatchers to sort it out, as we said last time. 
</P>
<P>
 Now say there's no emergency at all, and all four vehicles, including the mail 
truck, arrive at the intersection at the same time. At this point, it makes no 
difference whether you're driving a firetruck or a Tonka truck; everyone is 
equal. 
</P>
<P>
 So who goes first, since there is someone to the right of each driver? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no real correct answer to that," said CHP Officer Tito Gomez. "There 
you just have to use your best judgment. . . . If you proceed through the 
intersection, you should do so in a safe manner."

MUSLIMS GATHER TO CELEBRATE RAMADAN; RELIGION: ABOUT 2,500 PRAY AT CSUN TO MARK 
THE END OF HOLY MONTH. SERMON URGES PATIENCE IN WAKE OF DISASTERS ABROAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Marking the end of the fasting month of Ramadan, about 2,500 Muslims assembled 
for prayers Sunday morning on a Cal State Northridge lawn and heard a sermon 
urging patience over the recent tragedies befalling Palestinian and Bosnian 
Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do not return evil for evil. Do not speak your anger, speak your mind," said 
Ahmed El-Gabalawy, an engineer who served as imam, or spiritual leader, for the 
prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday was the final day of Ramadan, when devout Muslims abstain from food 
and drink during daytime hours and reflect on spiritual lessons of the Koran, 
the scriptures of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 For 11 months of the year, observant Muslims rise daily at dawn for the first 
of five daily prayers. During Ramadan, most practitioners rise well before dawn 
to eat before the first prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Worshipers assembled at 7 a.m. Sunday on the campus' Sierra Quad, kneeling and 
sitting on plastic sheeting and prayer rugs. The men and boys outnumbered women 
and girls by a 3-1 margin -- not unusual for a religion in which the obligation 
of public prayer falls mainly on males. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a day of celebration and gratitude because Allah gave us the ability 
to fast successfully," said Mahmood Qureshi. He and others attending the 
service said they planned to visit friends during the day to exchange greetings 
and enjoy festive sweets. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other Muslims, Qureshi said he was upset at media coverage of Islam, 
which he said readily calls radical Muslims "terrorists" but finds other, less 
inflammatory words to describe Jewish radicals. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we cannot let anger overwhelm us. Allah keeps us on the right path," he 
said, using the Muslim word for God. 
</P>
<P>
 El-Gabalawy said in his sermon: "If you go after one Muslim, that is one 
thing, but if you attack the religion of Allah, then Allah will defend his 
religion." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in an interview, El-Gabalawy said he was not speaking of revenge for 
atrocities against Muslims in Bosnia or for a Jewish settler's shooting 
massacre of 30 Palestinian Muslims at worship in Hebron in the Israeli-occupied 
West Bank, which occurred on Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are against violence and terrorism in Los Angeles, New York or Palestine," 
he said. "The justice of Allah will be fulfilled either in this life or in the 
hereafter." 
</P>
<P>
 Qureshi, a professor at Cal State Northridge, recited the prayers within yards 
of the quake-damaged, multistory building where he used to teach business 
courses. Now he teaches in temporary buildings as the university struggles to 
rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing the severely damaged Oviatt Library in the distance, worshipers were 
reminded by El-Gabalawy in his sermon that what humans can do, Allah can undo 
in a matter of seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he told the crowd that the 6.8-magnitude earthquake had relatively 
little effect, other than some fallen block walls, on a site in Granada Hills 
where the Islamic Center of Northridge plans to build a $2.4-million mosque 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The center won city permission in 1990 to build. It now owns the land and a 
house on the Encino Avenue property and has paid $70,000 in city permits. 
</P>
<P>
 In his appeal for more contributions, El-Gabalawy said the grading work has 
been completed and the concrete foundation should be poured by June.

ON A NEW ROAD TO WORSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Led by a pastor playing a saxophone, members of a Pacoima church on Sunday 
marched from the rented gymnasium in which they had worshiped for nearly three 
years to a spanking new, 500-seat building on Herrick Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 members of the Paradise Church of God in Christ walked the two miles 
between their rented worship space and the new $245,000 structure, built partly 
with volunteer labor because the church's $100,000 loan did not cover 
construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The church, whose members are affiliated with the nation's largest Pentecostal 
denomination, is the first among at least three black congregations in Pacoima 
to realize ambitious building plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 6.8-magnitude Northridge earthquake damaged dozens of churches in 
the San Fernando Valley, the temblor only broke two windows in the Paradise 
structure -- and failed to break Pastor Emmanuel Knight's determination to move 
his congregation into the building this month.

PILOT MAKES EMERGENCY LANDING AT PITCHESS JAIL; AVIATION: WILLIAM JENNINGS 
BRINGS HIS SINGLE-ENGINE CRAFT DOWN IN A FIELD AT THE FACILITY IN CASTAIC AFTER 
IT BEGINS LOSING ALTITUDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's back to the drawing board for William Jennings, a Lancaster resident who 
made an emergency landing in his homemade airplane at Peter J. Pitchess Honor 
Rancho on Sunday after the single-engine craft lost power, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings, 58, and his girlfriend, Eileen Salter, 43, left Fox Field in 
Lancaster about 1:30 p.m., climbed to 6,500 feet and headed for Santa Barbara 
in a Thorpe T-18, a popular model of homemade plane capable of speeds of more 
than 140 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 As the couple passed over Pyramid Lake, and Jennings pulled the throttle back 
to increase speed, they heard something inside the engine break, and Salter 
watched Jennings' face turn pale. 
</P>
<P>
 "He turned around and said, 'We gotta find a place to land,' " Salter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings, who built his plane over a 20-year period, turned and headed south 
above the Golden State Freeway, searching desperately for a place to land. 
</P>
<P>
 "These things are never easy," said Jennings, who has flown for 30 years and 
performed an emergency landing once before. "I made it to an airport last time, 
but this time there wasn't one close enough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the two-seat plane losing altitude at about 200 feet per minute, Jennings 
and Salter spotted an open pasture next to the freeway and headed for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was praying to St. Jude," Salter said. "We needed a miracle at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings set the plane down about 1:45 p.m. in a barley field that is part of 
the sprawling Pitchess Honor Rancho, which covers more than 2,800 acres and 
houses nearly 10,000 inmates, said Lt. Ron Markin of the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department, which operates the jail. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The aircraft landed about 600 yards away from the nearest jail facility, 
Markin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies at the Santa Clarita station said it is not uncommon for 
small planes to make emergency landings in the area. In the past, aircraft in 
trouble have touched down in the parking lot of Magic Mountain, an amusement 
park located across the highway and several miles south of the jail. About 
three months ago, a hot air balloon landed on private property across the 
highway from the jail, Markin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings was allowed to leave the plane at the jail for one day, and promised 
to return today, remove the wings and haul the aircraft back home, said 
Sheriff's Sgt. Barry Sandstrom.

CURBSIDE L.A.: QUAKE FAULTS

 Los Angeles' jagged seascapes, mountain ranges and sweeping valleys were 
shaped by the San Andreas and other faults. Here's a look at some striking, 
even bizarre topographical creations of earthquakes. 1. TEJON PASS 
</P>
<P>
 One of three major Southern California mountain passes created by the San 
Andreas Fault, where the Golden State Freeway cuts through the heart of the 
fault zone. A band of black, pulverized rock is visible in the deep road cut. 
The fault can also be seen along Gorman Post Road, where a row of ponds mark 
the main trace of the fault. 
</P>
<P>
 2. ANTELOPE VALLEY FREEWAY 
</P>
<P>
 The road cut along the Antelope Valley Freeway exposes the spectacular action 
of the San Andreas Fault, where layers of sedimentary rock have been bent and 
contorted by compression -- most recently by an 1857 earthquake whose magnitude 
is estimated at more than 8.0. To get the best view, park along Avenue S just 
west of the freeway and walk up the hill.  
</P>
<P>
 3. DEVIL'S PUNCHBOWL 
</P>
<P>
 Wedged between the San Andreas and Punchbowl faults, these 1,300 acres of tan 
and pink sandstone have been compressed, folded, broken, uplifted and eroded 
into a grand geological display dating back more than 12 million years. The 
rocks that were once horizontal have been tilted upright by compression between 
these two major faults. To see this wilderness area and nature preserve, take 
the Golden State Freeway to the Antelope Valley Freeway and exit at Pearblossom 
Highway, which joins California 138. Continue east to Pearblossom. Go south on 
Longview Road (County N6) and follow the county route and signs to Devil's 
Punchbowl County Park. 
</P>
<P>
 4. LAMONT ODETT OVERLOOK 
</P>
<P>
 Vivid evidence of the crushing and folding effects of fault action can be seen 
at this overlook, named for the former part-owner of the Antelope Valley Press 
Newspapers. It is at the edge of the San Andreas Fault zone overlooking Lake 
Palmdale off the Antelope Valley Freeway, about two miles north of the 
Pearblossom Highway exit. Northbound drivers can stop at the Vista Point 
turnout south of the Avenue S off-ramp. A plaque points out the fault line. 
</P>
<P>
 5. ARCADIA WILDERNESS PRESERVE 
</P>
<P>
 In the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains is a series of east-west 
trending faults known as the Sierra Madre Fault zone. A fault scarp can be seen 
on the west side of the preserve, about 200 feet upstream from the bridge. It 
appears as a sharp juxtaposition between two contrasting rock types. Take the 
Foothill Freeway to Santa Anita Avenue, drive north toward the mountains about 
one mile, turn right on Elkins Avenue and left on Highland Oaks Drive. The 
entrance to the park is about one mile north. The preserve is closed on 
weekends except by reservation. 
</P>
<P>
 6. THE EAGLE ROCK 
</P>
<P>
 On the south side of the Eagle Rock Fault zone stands a 50-foot boulder whose 
configuration gave the community of Eagle Rock its name. Part of the 
20,000-foot-deep fault runs along the back of the prominent rock. Take the 
Ventura Freeway to the Figueroa Street exit. Go south one block to Colorado 
Boulevard, turn east on Colorado and then north on Patrician Way. Cross over 
the freeway, park before the street narrows, and walk north about 100 feet. On 
the left side of the road, at the base of Eagle Rock, look for a change from 
pebbly sandstone to crushed rock. 
</P>
<P>
 7. PACOIMA CANYON 
</P>
<P>
 A few yards off Little Tujunga Road is a microcosm of the natural forces that 
shaped the mountains. The San Gabriel Fault, exposed in the cliff face, lies 
between two massive rock formations. A few feet away, a small stream steadily 
erodes the cliff. To get there, take the Foothill Freeway to Little Tujunga 
Road and drive about 10 miles north. The area is identified by a Forest Service 
marker. 
</P>
<P>
 8. BENEDICT CANYON 
</P>
<P>
 Along the San Diego Freeway, south of Getty Center Drive, look west for a 
change from light sandstone to a dark gray layered shale, showing where the 
Benedict Canyon Fault crosses the freeway about half a mile north of Sunset 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 9. TOPANGA CANYON 
</P>
<P>
 The Tuna Canyon Fault zone crosses Topanga Canyon. Drive 2.2 miles north of 
Pacific Coast Highway on Topanga Canyon Boulevard and park just north of the 
bridge at the entrance to the narrows of the Topanga Canyon. Look for an abrupt 
change from very light-colored sandstone to layers of a reddish-brown pebbly 
rock, or conglomerate, which look like they have been sliced. 
</P>
<P>
 10. SYLMAR 
</P>
<P>
 To find the Mission Wells Fault in the San Fernando Fault zone, take the 
Rinaldi Street exit of the San Diego Freeway. About three-quarters of a mile 
north of the exit, look for what is called a "zone of disruption," where gray 
shale rocks are dislodged from hillside and, in some cases, crumble when picked 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 11. SIMI VALLEY FREEWAY SUMMIT 
</P>
<P>
 In the Chatsworth area, one of many small unnamed faults can be seen in the 
deep road cuts at the summit of Simi Valley Freeway west of Topanga Canyon 
Boulevard. Look for offsets in the layered shale and sandstone. This area can 
be seen from the south side of the freeway, across from Call Box No. 4.

VALLEY CHRONICLE: DOLL MAKER ENJOYS TEACHING ART OF CREATING BEAUTIFUL OBJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Janet Coronel's Agoura home is a doll's house. Not the kind Ibsen wrote about, 
but a place where she makes dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Coronel, 53, learned the art 30 years ago from a German couple who were her 
next-door neighbors, and she has been making dolls and teaching others how to 
make them ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Doll making has existed since man began walking upright. The toys have evolved 
from cornhusks with eyes to a multimillion-dollar industry featuring dolls that 
cry, talk, wet and exhibit anatomically correct body parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Coronel's dolls don't do any of that stuff. They are just beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 What a concept. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dolls I sell in stores go for between $300 and $1,000," Coronel says. 
"They are all porcelain or porcelain with cloth bodies and can be personalized 
to the wishes of the buyer." Coronel said people for whom she creates dolls 
often ask her to make them look like their children or grandchildren as a 
timeless remembrance of the youngster -- a keepsake to be passed on to 
generations to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Coronel sells her delicate dolls through several outlets, including the West 
Hills Antique Center in the Fallbrook Mall in West Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 She makes the dolls from one of the thousands of molds that she keeps at her 
home studio, which also includes a kiln. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 17, some of the molds were destroyed or severely damaged by the 
earthquake, but Coronel says she isn't heading for FEMA anytime soon. "I can 
replace them. It isn't like I lost my home," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Coronel says she gets her greatest pleasure from teaching others how to create 
these porcelain treasures. "It's a skill that is meaningful for both the doll 
creator and the person who receives the doll," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 For many years Coronel taught at small arts and crafts outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several times the Los Angeles Unified School District people wrote to ask if 
I would like to teach through the adult-education system, but I didn't answer 
them because I didn't even have my high school diploma," she says. "I didn't 
think it would work." 
</P>
<P>
 She says she thinks the school district singled her out because she is one of 
the few people willing to go into the classroom to teach doll making. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are wonderful teachers in Southern California, but they don't want to 
have to schlep all their equipment into a classroom. They teach at their 
studios," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually Coronel went back to school, got her high school diploma and took 
the courses required to teach in the district schools. She taught her first 
class for the Kennedy-San Fernando Community Adult School in 1986 and has been 
instructing for that adult school ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Her classes now meet at the Rinaldi Adult Center in Granada Hills, where 
Kennedy-San Fernando moved after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 People start anytime of the year for a $35 registration fee, which pays for 
the instruction and porcelain clay. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students buy their own paints, brushes, cleaning tools and other 
equipment, which costs about $100 and should last a long time," Coronel says. 
</P>
<P>
 For years Coronel kept the first doll she ever made, for less than sentimental 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever someone in class would say they weren't happy with their first 
effort, I would show them mine," she says, with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 That first doll was a victim of the Northridge earthquake, according to the 
doll maker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have others," she says, philosophically. Slovakians Taking Pride in Their 
History and Culture 
</P>
<P>
 For thousands of years, Slovakia has been a reluctant bride shotgunned into 
forced marriages with muscle-bound nations that wanted to protect her and tell 
her what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 First it was the Hungarians, then the Russians, then the Czechs, all of whom 
thought they knew what was best for little Slovakia. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the 1991 Velvet Revolution, when what was then Czechoslovakia booted 
the Communists out and elevated Vaclav Havel to something approaching 
sainthood, a segment of the Slovak population said to their much better known 
and celebrated Czech neighbors, "Who needs you? We're outta here." 
</P>
<P>
 The separatists got their wish in 1993, while the Velvet Revolutionaries were 
still figuring out how to govern the newly capitalistic Czechoslovakia. The 
Velvet Divorce came to be. 
</P>
<P>
 The divorce established what is now known as the Slovak Republic and 
independence for its people, even though some in Slovakia grumble over the 
dissolution of Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon Danihels of Woodland Hills is not among the grumblers. 
</P>
<P>
 He's president of the Slovak World Congress, which supported independence and 
now aspires to educate the 4 million expatriated Slovak people and people of 
Slovak origin around the globe about their newly independent homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Congress is a nonprofit umbrella organization, chartered in New York, 
which since independence has taken on the qualities of an International Chamber 
of Culture and Commerce. Now in the midst of his four-year, non-paying 
presidency, Danihels is an ambassador without portfolio from Slovakia to the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Danihels estimates there are about 100,000 people of Slovak descent who reside 
in or around the San Fernando and Antelope valleys, many of whom already are 
members of local Slovak organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Danihels, a local real estate developer and entrepreneur, also says he is 
privy to the current Slovak government and its goals and aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he is just back from a talk with Slovak President Michal Kovac, but 
declines to expound on the discussion, saying those things are not for other 
people to know. 
</P>
<P>
 What he does want other people to know is that Slovakia is a beautiful place 
to visit, particularly if you are a person of Slovak heritage as he says Robert 
Urich, Tom Selleck and astronaut Eugene Cernan are. 
</P>
<P>
 The Czechs are often painted as the world's intellectual and Bohemian darlings 
with their glittering culture, crystal and castles. The Slovaks have been 
painted dull and drab. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Danihels' job to make certain you know the Slovaks also have their 
intellects. 
</P>
<P>
 And, he says, their castles are second to none. Learning Slovak Language 
Requires Overcoming Obstacles 
</P>
<P>
 You are convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 You are packing your bags for Slovakia. 
</P>
<P>
 But, wait, first you need to know the language. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Barrett may be your man. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett, a Woodland Hills electrical engineer of Irish-Slovak heritage, 
decided he wanted to speak Slovak several years ago. He couldn't find a 
teacher, so he basically taught himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Must have done a good job. He's now offering classes through Cal State 
Northridge extension school. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually he had been offering them, but since the earthquake the class has 
nowhere to meet. 
</P>
<P>
 He says the extension program is helping him look for space and the class will 
be starting up again soon. 
</P>
<P>
 He's hoping for sometime next month. Overheard: 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the Robin Hood of Academy voters. He puts the ballot on the wall and 
throws darts at it to decide who to vote for."

100 PEOPLE INVOLVED IN DRUNKEN MELEE IN MALIBU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A drunken melee involving more than 100 people broke out in front of a popular 
Malibu roadside eatery Sunday afternoon, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 16 deputies from the Ventura County Sheriff's Department and at 
least one California Highway Patrol unit converged on a section of beach in 
front of Neptune's Net restaurant, 42505 Pacific Coast Highway, about 4 p.m. to 
quell a drunken party that had apparently grown out of control, according to 
Sheriff's Lt. Michael Gullon. 
</P>
<P>
 Gullon said one man was arrested for failing to disperse during the melee, 
which took the officers -- along with a Ventura County sheriff's helicopter 
unit -- more than 90 minutes to control. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe there were several beer kegs involved. It was a situation where 
people just had way too much to drink," Gullon said. "When we got on scene, it 
was out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 The name of the arrested man was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
 What sparked the melee was not clear Sunday night, but Gullon said arriving 
deputies saw a fight going in an impromptu boxing ring that had been set up on 
the beach and several other fights nearby. J. E. MITCHELL

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; HIGH COURT ENDS 2-YEAR BRIDGE FIGHT; FINANCES: 
THE JURISTS REFUSE TO HEAR LANCASTER'S APPEAL OF A RULING THAT SHOT DOWN THE 
CITY'S FUNDING PLAN FOR THE AVENUE L OVERPASS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The simple dirt and concrete bridge that will soon carry cars over busy Sierra 
Highway and the adjacent railroad tracks hardly looks like the sort of project 
that would hurl Lancaster into the center of a fierce legal battle. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city's creative financing plan for the $13.6-million Avenue L Overpass 
did indeed trigger a two-year legal tussle that was resolved only last month by 
the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 To pay for the bridge, Lancaster wanted to use redevelopment funds reserved 
for housing projects. The city argued that the project would encourage the 
construction of dwellings on the city's east side. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court, however, announced in February that it would not 
reconsider a lower court ruling that shot down the city's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 To guard against such a setback, the city long ago allocated other money to 
pay for the bridge, which is scheduled to open next week. But city officials 
continued to defend the original funding plan in court, and they have not ruled 
out the use of a revised version in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court's decision handed a victory to Kathryn Reimann, a Los Angeles 
attorney whose law firm represents other redevelopment agencies in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a diversion of funds that should be used for affordable housing," 
Reimann said of the city's original plan. "This was a matter of an abuse. It 
was illegal in the first instance, and a resident of Lancaster heard about it 
and asked us to represent her." 
</P>
<P>
 The legal challenge originated after the City Council, as directors of the 
Lancaster Redevelopment Agency, voted in late 1991 to approve a $24-million 
plan to build two new bridges. One was to be at Avenue L, near the southern end 
of the city; the other at Avenue H, in the north. 
</P>
<P>
 The bridges were to cross Sierra Highway and more importantly the railroad 
tracks that run beside it and bisect the city. When trains use these tracks, 
east-west traffic in the city -- including emergency vehicles -- comes to a 
standstill. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said these bridges would make it easier for deputies and 
paramedics to respond to calls on both sides of the tracks. In addition, they 
said the bridges would be key components of a "peripheral loop" that would 
carry traffic around the outskirts of Lancaster, relieving congestion on the 
city's interior streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The now completed Avenue L Overpass is 2,542 feet long, including a bridge 
structure that is 350 feet long, 100 feet wide and 25 feet high. Two ramps, 
with traffic signals, were built to connect Sierra Highway to the overpass. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the Avenue H Overpass has not yet begun. 
</P>
<P>
 To pay for these projects, the city originally proposed using redevelopment 
funds that, under state law, must be used to build, assist or improve housing 
for people with low and moderate incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster officials argued that the bridges would encourage development on the 
east side of the city. In addition, they said the financing plan included 
incentives for builders who agreed to reserve at least 15% of their housing 
units for families with low or moderate incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 When the plan drew criticism from the public, the city asked a Superior Court 
judge to rule on its validity. Resident Dolores Dibley asked Reimann's firm to 
contest it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a scam and still is," Dibley said in a recent interview. "There's a 
lot going on there that the public doesn't know about. When I saw the fraud 
that was being perpetrated, I thought it was best to act to put a stop to it." 
</P>
<P>
 But the first court ruling in the case went against Dibley. In August, 1992, 
San Fernando Superior Court Judge David M. Schacter ruled that the city's plan 
was valid because the bridges would open an inaccessible area where new housing 
would be built. 
</P>
<P>
 His decision was overturned, however, by the 2nd District Court of Appeal in 
Los Angeles. In an opinion filed in November, the three-judge panel said 
Lancaster's plan provided "no assurance . . . that any affordable housing will 
be built." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Miriam Vogel, who wrote the opinion, concluded: "There is nothing to 
suggest this entire plan is anything more than a scheme to divert restricted 
housing funds to the city to pay for the construction of the overpasses." 
</P>
<P>
 The city appealed that ruling to the state Supreme Court, which declined to 
review the case. The high court also denied the city's bid to keep the Court of 
Appeal's opinion from being published. That means the decision can be cited as 
a precedent if similar financing plans are challenged in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is important," said Reimann. "There may have been other cities tempted to 
do something like this." 
</P>
<P>
 David R. McEwen, Lancaster's city attorney, stands by the original financing 
plan for the bridge. Although there are no immediate plans to do so, he said 
the city could revise the plan and try to pay for another project with it. The 
revised proposal might include documents proving that builders do plan to use 
the affordable housing incentives, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program, based on the concepts we used, I think is valid," McEwen said. 
"I think we need to reflect a bit and make sure what we are doing fits within 
the guidelines set by the Court of Appeals." 
</P>
<P>
 He disputed that court's conclusion that Lancaster's plan was merely a scheme 
to divert housing funds to a bridge project. "I strongly disagree with their 
comment on that," McEwen said. "What we were doing was designed to produce 
housing." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the principles at stake, Reimann said her firm challenged the 
bridge plan for Dibley without charge. Now that the case is decided, Reimann 
said her firm may ask a judge to order Lancaster to pay her firm's legal 
expenses, which could exceed $100,000, Reimann said. 
</P>
<P>
 McEwen said he has asked for an accounting of how much the city spent on the 
bridge financing case, but he declined Friday to estimate the figure. "I 
wouldn't want to guess what it is," he said.

MIKE DOWNEY: THIS JORDAN FUSS IS EMBARRASSING FOR SILLY CRITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Jordan has embarrassed nobody. Michael Jordan has disgraced nothing. 
All the man did was play some baseball. He didn't ask to captain a nuclear 
submarine. He didn't ask to be President of the United States for a two-week 
tryout. He didn't ask to drive in the Indy 500, where he might kill somebody. 
He didn't ask to do open-heart surgery in place of somebody's regular doctor. 
He asked if he could play some baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 We have to get over this overromanticized notion of a baseball field being an 
"emerald chessboard" where all the young rooks grow up to be bishops and kings. 
Baseball drips with two things -- sentimentality and tobacco juice. You would 
have thought Jordan had soiled hallowed ground by trespassing onto the 
Grapefruit League grass, or contaminated a sterile lab. Jordan drew stares like 
somebody leaving muddy footprints in a Japanese restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 I never heard anybody howl that Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway should 
steer clear of the acting profession during "Blue Chips" and leave the Thespian 
trade to trained experts like Nick Nolte and Mary McDonnell. I never heard of 
Ronald Reagan or Gopher from "Love Boat" being disqualified from politics 
because they had once been actors. I never felt America's outrage that a 
football player, Herschel Walker, had the audacity to think he could push a 
bobsled, or that Paul Newman planned to race an auto. 
</P>
<P>
 But, ohhhh, heaven forbid Michael Jordan should see if his athletic prowess 
was such that he could excel at another sport before he was too old to find 
out. JORDAN AND WHITE SOX ARE EMBARRASSING BASEBALL, cried the cover of Sports 
Illustrated's issue of March 14. Funny, but I never heard of an editor from 
Sports Illustrated telling one of their writers: "Only write about stuff you 
know." 
</P>
<P>
 How else could Jordan learn but to try? Must he be mocked for not 
double-dipping during his prime, the way Bo Jackson and Deion Sanders did, 
hopping on copters between stadia? (Anybody notice that neither Bo nor Neon 
Deion has ever won a professional championship in anything?) Must the 
iron-willed Mike endure ridicule because he goes hitless in his first pro at- 
bats? If the majors had pulled that on Willie Mays, he never would have lasted 
beyond his first April. 
</P>
<P>
 First time up in a spring intrasquad game, Michael Jordan stroked a liner to 
left field. He was robbed by a diving, backhanded catch. Now, I don't know 
about you, but this doesn't sound to me like someone who wouldn't know a 
Louisville Slugger bat from a Louis XVI antique chair. Far be it for me to 
dabble in revisionist history, but let me tell you something, baseball lovers. 
Air Jordan doubles in his first at-bat, Mel Allen wouldn't have been the only 
one out there shouting: "How a-BOUT that?!" 
</P>
<P>
 Here is baseball, a game that has given us such illustrious individuals as 
Herb Washington, a professional pinch-runner, and we can't even give Michael 
Jordan a chance? Come on. Where is the harm? Baseball couldn't afford a few 
weeks to find out if a 6 foot 6, supremely conditioned specimen could catch a 
ball or swing a stick? Doubters told one-handed Jim Abbott he couldn't play, 
either. He could play. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of my more righteous brothers in the ink industry have sure had a field 
day with Michael. So have certain baseball professionals, like the anonymous 
American League manager who told that magazine: "This guy thinks he can become 
a hitter in a couple of months. It's a disgrace to the game." It is?  
</P>
<P>
 No, a disgrace to a game is letting one of your outfielders pitch when there 
are paying customers in the stands. A disgrace is a 65-year-old man kicking 
dirt on an authority figure's shoes. A disgrace is tossing a firecracker near 
some fans. A disgrace is spitting indoors. A disgrace is saying of a 
fire-scorched town, "Let it burn." A disgrace is an umpire telling a California 
Angel batter he's a .220-hitting chump and doesn't deserve a call. 
</P>
<P>
 A disgrace is a manager's gambling, a general manager's bigotry and an owner's 
treating men like dogs and dogs like men. A disgrace is dumping ice water on 
another human being. A disgrace is televising a World Series after midnight on 
a school night. A disgrace is charging a family of four $100 for tickets and 
hot dogs. A disgrace is Don Baylor telling angry Dodgers that if they don't 
like playing rough, they should "wear a dress." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jordan, a disgrace? 
</P>
<P>
 All that Michael did was what everyone in the world should do. He tried. He 
didn't sit around counting his money. He didn't procrastinate. He didn't slouch 
around the house, daydreaming like Walter Mitty, picturing himself at the plate 
against Roger Clemens, wondering: "Could I have ever been a baseball player?" 
He tried. The man actually, honestly, physically tried. 
</P>
<P>
 I have always been curious whether I could have been a doctor. Nobody is 
stopping me from going to med school. I could go to law school. Or 
truck-driving school (as so many readers believe I should). Or even drama 
school. If what Shaq did was acting, man, I could do Chekhov. 
</P>
<P>
 Could I become a Chicago Bull? Could I become a Dodger? Well, the problem 
there is, they take one look at this Mike and say, "No way." Whereas, they take 
one look at that other Mike and say, "Hmmm. Maybe." 
</P>
<P>
 I seriously doubt Michael Jordan could play baseball in the majors. Except, of 
course, for the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 But he gave it a shot. So what? He wasn't embarrassed. I wasn't embarrassed. 
Were you embarrassed? Baseball supposedly was embarrassed. People sure do 
embarrass easy these days.

SATURDAY'S GAMES UPSET THE CART; NCAA MEN: WEEKEND LOSSES BY THE TOP TEAMS 
RESULT IN A SCRAMBLE OF NO. 1 SEEDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Their three-night slumber party finally finished, the nine members of the NCAA 
tournament selection committee emerged from a Kansas City hotel Sunday with 
this amazing revelation: 
</P>
<P>
 Geez, choosing and seeding 64 teams sure is tough. 
</P>
<P>
 A news flash, this wasn't. Not after Black Saturday, when six of the top eight 
and nine of the top 16 ranked teams lost. Not after a season of strangeness 
that saw a handful of teams play tag with the No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure I've ever been a part of a weekend, of a day like (Saturday)," 
said Tom Butters, the Duke athletic director who served his sixth and final 
year as selection committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 The upsets kept the committee up past 11 o'clock Saturday evening and required 
an earlier-than-planned 7 a.m. meeting Sunday. Unlike past years, when the 
committee spent much of its time doing what Butters calls "the nitty gritty" -- 
that is, selecting among the borderline teams -- the members were compelled to 
devote more attention to the seedings. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons are obvious. Before Saturday, the selection committee had begun to 
slot teams in the appropriate 1-12 seedings in the four regions. Then came the 
onrush of unexpected defeats, leaving the nine members bleary eyed as they were 
forced to reassess the big board again. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly Connecticut, the Big East Conference regular-season champion, but 
Saturday upset victim, wasn't a No. 1-seeded anymore. Missouri, the Big Eight 
Conference regular-season champion, found itself being moved from region to 
region after a league tournament loss to Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona, another surprise loser, was dropped down the seeding ladder. Similar 
fates were considered for UCLA, Kansas, California, Michigan and the rest of 
upset losers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was probably the most difficult of the past three years because of (the 
seedings)," said Bob Frederick, Kansas athletic director and incoming selection 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the committee was through tinkering, a field of 34 at-large teams 
and 30 automatic qualifiers began to take shape. Along with it came the 
seedings. 
</P>
<P>
 The top four in each region: 
</P>
<P>
 East -- North Carolina, Connecticut, Florida and Temple. 
</P>
<P>
 Southeast -- Purdue, Duke, Kentucky and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Midwest -- Arkansas, Massachusetts, Michigan and Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
 West -- Missouri, Arizona, Louisville and Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The most interesting and perhaps the most competitive of the four regionals is 
the East, where you will find Tar Heel Coach Dean Smith, Temple's John Chaney 
and Indiana's Bob Knight, whose Hoosiers are seeded No. 5, all in the same 
sub-regional at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 The easiest of the regionals? Probably the West, where three of the top four 
seeds -- Missouri, Arizona and Syracuse -- lost their last games. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, UCLA was sent to Oklahoma City, seeded No. 5 in the Midwest 
Regional, while Pepperdine was shipped to Wichita, Kan., seeded No. 14 in the 
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins will face No. 12 Tulsa, whose campus isn't that far from Oklahoma 
City, and the Waves will play No. 3 Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the Pacific 10 Conference received four bids, beginning with Arizona, 
then UCLA, California and late-charging Washington State, which earned a berth 
for the first time since George Raveling was the coach in Pullman. Left out was 
Stanford, which finished 17-10 and tied for fourth in the league with 
Washington State and Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were several teams in the Pac-10 that were considered," said Butters, 
who later added that there was "no question" that the Cougars were the easy 
choice as the fourth selectee in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 As for UCLA, Arizona and Cal -- all losers on Saturday -- the selection 
committee was fairly kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona probably would have been seeded No. 1 in the West had it beaten the 
Sun Devils on Saturday. Instead, the committee placed the Wildcats, who have 
lost their last two first-round NCAA games, in Sacramento to face No. 15-seeded 
Loyola (Md.). 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA, which has lost six of its last 13 games, and Cal both had chances to be 
seeded No. 4. But then they botched things on Saturday and fell to No. 5 spots. 
All in all, not too harsh a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Arizona, Cal and UCLA) didn't hurt themselves as much as they might have 
helped themselves had they won," Butters said. 
</P>
<P>
 It could have been worse for the three Pac-10 teams. They could have been 
Georgia Tech, which wasn't even invited to the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yellow Jackets (16-12) were left out despite two victories against North 
Carolina and victories against Virginia, Temple and Maryland. Butters 
acknowledged the quality of Georgia Tech's victories, but said there weren't 
enough of them to counter-balance the unexpected losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Other teams relegated to NIT hopeful-status were Brigham Young (21-9), Xavier 
(20-7), Texas A&M (19-10), Mississippi State (17-10) and Villanova (15-12). 
</P>
<P>
 In all, there were 63 teams with 20 or more victories that were considered by 
the committee. Forty-five of them reached the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 In something of a mild surprise, Tulsa, which was beaten early in the Missouri 
Valley Conference tournament, and College of Charleston of the Trans America 
Conference both received NCAA invitations. 
</P>
<P>
 Charleston (24-3) was helped, Butters said, by a 22-point victory against 
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 In all likelihood, Charleston and Tulsa, both seeded No. 12 seeds, were the 
last two at-large teams added to the field of 64. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven teams from the Big Ten Conference are in the tournament, followed by six 
from the Big East, five from the Atlantic Coast Conference, four from the 
Southeastern, Pac-10, Great Midwest -- which receives no automatic bid -- and 
the Big Eight conferences and three from the Atlantic 10 Conference. Selections 
by Conference 
</P>

ANGELS FIND CARBON COPY; EDUARDO PEREZ SEEMS DESTINED TO BE EVEN BETTER THAN 
HIS DAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Slouched in front of his locker, Eduardo Perez stared at the flurry of 
activity in the middle of the Angel clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 What had caught his eye were the clubhouse attendants. They were picking up 
dirty socks and uniforms and putting them in one laundry cart; sorting out the 
clean ones in another. And making sure all of the contents were properly 
marked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, if you guys need a hand, let me know," Perez blurted. "I'm pretty good, 
you know?" 
</P>
<P>
 The three attendants stopped, looked at Perez, but saw no hint of sarcasm. He 
actually looked serious. Come on, what was the punch line? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm serious," Perez said. "I'm a veteran at this. You can ask me any number, 
and I'll tell you whose uniform it is." 
</P>
<P>
 They began testing him in rapid-fire. . OK, who's number 66? Bob Gamez. Who's 
65? Mark Sweeney. Who's 54? Hmm, Simmons, Nelson Simmons. Who's 72? Andrew 
Lorraine. 
</P>
<P>
 The attendants looked at one another in disbelief. This was amazing. Most 
major league players couldn't tell you the uniform number of their closest 
teammates, and this kid was rattling off numbers of non-roster players he had 
barely met. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, tell them Eduardo could do that since he could talk," said Bernie Stowe, 
the Cincinnati Reds' clubhouse attendant. "I put him to work early. He was 
stealing bubble gum out of the back room, so I made him work for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like he's done all right for himself. People around here tell me 
he's going to be a good one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too bad, he could have been a great clubbie." 
</P>
<P>
 Eduardo Antanacio Perez, who has been hanging around major league clubhouses 
since the day he could walk, instead will be attempting an altogether different 
task. 
</P>
<P>
 He might not be able to sway any voters to get his dad into the Hall of Fame, 
and he certainly won't be able to persuade Cincinnati Red owner Marge Schott to 
rehire him as manager, but he can pay tribute in his special way. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez will wear No. 24 this season in honor of his father, Tony. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can never expect to have the career like my father," he said, "but maybe I 
can revive some of those memories. Maybe people will then remember what kind of 
player he was. How he deserves to be in the Hall of Fame. How he deserves to 
get another shot at managing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, that would be sweet, wouldn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 It's unfair really, maybe even cruel, but Perez, 24, is prepared for the 
inevitable. He is going to be compared to his father as long as he plays the 
game.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind it," he said. "It's a compliment. He was my idol. Really, I like 
hearing that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way he drove in runs, the way he acted in the clubhouse, who wouldn't 
want to be compared to him?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Perez was considered one of the finest clutch hitters in the game, 
batting .279 with 379 homers and 1,652 runs batted in during a 23-year career. 
There are those who insist he was as responsible as anyone for the success of 
the Big Red Machine. 
</P>
<P>
 There also are those who insist Eduardo Perez can be every bit as good. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kid is stronger than his father," said Angel executive Preston Gomez, 
who has known Eduardo since he was born. "This kid is faster than his father. 
This kid is just as aggressive as his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "And there's no question in my mind he can be just as good as his father." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony boasted to his friends when Eduardo was in Little League that he would 
make it to the big leagues. There really was no basis for his prophecy, but 
there was just that feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just knew he wanted it," Tony said. "There was no question in his own mind 
that this is what he wanted to do. I'd send him to school, but he didn't want 
to go. He just wanted to play baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him, you have to go to school to read and write. Well, a few months 
later he comes up to me and says, 'I ain't going to school no more. That's it.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I say, 'Why Eduardo?' 
</P>
<P>
 "He tells me, 'Because I already learned how to write my name for autographs.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed only natural for Perez and his friends to play major league 
baseball. He grew up hanging around the clubhouse with Ken Griffey Jr., Brian 
McRae, Pete Rose Jr., and Ed Sprague. They watched their fathers win World 
Series after World Series, dreaming one day of doing the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember we'd run behind the home-plate area at the stadium and yell, 
'Umpire needs glasses, umpire needs glasses,' Eduardo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even when our fathers swung and missed, and struck out, we'd yell it. We were 
crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult to believe that Griffey Jr. and McRae already are established 
stars in the American League, that Sprague is a World Series hero, and that 
Perez's turn may be next. It seems like only yesterday that their fathers 
retired, and now the kids are taking over.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps this is why Jose Martinez, Chicago Cub first base coach, could not 
resist the urge to tease Perez last week when he reached first base. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, if it wasn't for me, you wouldn't be standing here," Martinez said. "I 
was the guy who introduced your parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Perez: "Uh, thanks, I appreciate it. Anything I can do for you?" 
</P>
<P>
 It's this affable personality that reminds so many people of his father. They 
each are so gracious and easygoing that it seems impossible they would find 
enemies, or that anyone would want to harm them. 
</P>
<P>
 Eduardo certainly realized his father's popularity last season when Tony was 
fired as manager of the Cincinnati Reds after only 44 games. The baseball world 
was infuriated, and everywhere Eduardo traveled, strangers would come up and 
offer their condolences. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seemed so planned out," Eduardo said. "It's not the kind of move a 
rookie general manager (Jim Bowden) decides. I mean, he didn't even have the 
courtesy to bring him into his office. He told him on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was one person I would hate to be used it would be my dad. And to 
me, my dad was used." 
</P>
<P>
 If there was anything remotely gratifying about the ordeal, Tony said, it was 
being able to see his son play for the first time in the major leagues. Eduardo 
made his major league debut July 27, hitting a double in his first at-bat and a 
homer in his last. He finished the season batting .250 with four homers and 30 
RBIs in 52 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow in the off-season, 
prompting the Angels to move him from third base to left field. There will be 
less stress on his elbow in the outfield, they said, and he also will be used 
at first base. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, any questions about the elbow impairing his offensive skills have 
vanished. Perez is hitting .412 this spring with one home run and a 
team-leading eight RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kid is going to be something," said Max Oliveras, Perez's manager last 
season at triple-A Vancouver. "It's unbelievable the way he reminds me of his 
father. He's got the same mannerisms at the plate, everything. The only thing 
different is that he's got a little longer swing, and holds the bat higher." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, who is appearing in his first major league camp as a player, still 
makes sure that he's treated no differently than any other young guy trying to 
make the club. He hangs with the rookies, talks with the clubbies, and asks 
questions of the veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know spring training should be kind of old to me," he said, "but this is 
totally different. I'm not just some kid running around getting in his dad's 
way. I'm a major leaguer now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows, maybe some day they'll look at my dad and say, 'Hey, aren't you 
Eddie's father?' 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that would be something."

USC PRIZE: PLACEMENT IN MIDEAST REGIONAL; NCAA WOMEN: STANFORD STAYS IN WEST 
AFTER FINISHING SECOND TO TROJANS IN PAC-10. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cheryl Miller and the USC women's basketball team were handed their reward 
Sunday for winning the Pacific 10 Conference championship: assignment to the 
NCAA tournament's Mideast Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans, who on Saturday ended a five-year Stanford grip on the conference 
title, were nevertheless sent out of the West Region in the first 64-team 
women's NCAA tournament. Stanford, which finished second in the Pac-10, stayed 
in the West and is expected to said into the March 24-26 West Regional at Palo 
Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 USC (23-3) ended the regular season with a 16-2 conference record and was 
ranked ninth in the Associated Press poll. Stanford (22-5, 15-3) was ranked 
11th and could qualify for the Final Four without having to go to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Its first- and second-round games would also be played at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, provided it wins two home games, -- must travel 1,300 miles to the 
University of Arkansas, where the Trojans could be joined by top-ranked 
Tennessee, No. 7 Louisiana Tech and No. 8 Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, there were no howls of outrage at Heritage Hall when the 
pairings were announced. In fact, Miller's players burst into cheers.  
</P>
<P>
 "We can beat Stanford on any neutral court, but beating them up there is the 
hardest thing we've had to do since I've been here," said senior Lisa Leslie. 
</P>
<P>
 USC defeated Stanford at the Lyon Center, 94-82, but lost at Maples Pavilion, 
80-50. 
</P>
<P>
 A trip to Fayetteville, Ark., is contingent on the Trojans first winning two 
games at the Sports Arena. USC plays Portland (17-11) Wednesday night at 7:30. 
The winner plays George Washington (22-7) or Alabama-Birmingham (23-5) on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 If USC wins, it would play again at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 It should not have made any difference to Miller where the NCAA sent her team, 
since she predicted moments after the 80-50 loss at Stanford that USC would win 
the rest of its games. 
</P>
<P>
 But the idea of a conference champion being sent on the road while the 
runner-up plays host to its own regional rankled just a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won the championship . . . my eyebrows are raised," Miller said. "I'd like 
to have been in the (selection) committee room, and know who threw us in the 
Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
 "One good thing: I've been to Fayetteville. There are absolutely no 
distractions there." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked later why Stanford and USC were kept apart in the tournament, NCAA 
women's basketball committee chairman Linda Bruno spoke of fairness. 
</P>
<P>
 "The committee felt strongly that if a conference had two strong teams, it was 
best to try and separate them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stanford is hosting that regional on its home floor. We felt the fairest 
thing, the best-balanced thing, was not to put USC there." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford, winner of two of the last four NCAA tournaments, figures as a heavy 
favorite over Wisconsin Green Bay (18-10) Wednesday night at Stanford. The 
winner will play Montana (24-4) or Nevada Las Vegas (23-6). 
</P>
<P>
 Five Pac-10 teams were handed postseason berths on Sunday. Washington (20-7) 
will play host to Boise State (23-5), Oregon (19-8) will play host to Santa 
Clara (21-6) and Oregon State (17-10) will play at Alabama (22-6) in 
first-round games Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford, Oregon and Washington are all in the West Regional, Oregon State in 
the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA seemed tournament-bound until All-American Natalie Williams suffered a 
season-ending knee injury at Stanford Feb. 26. UCLA lost that game and its 
final three and finished 15-12 overall, 10-8 in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland, USC's first-round opponent, came out of nowhere to win the West 
Coast Conference tournament title at Santa Clara. The Pilots finished 7-7 in 
the WCC, but have won eight of their last 10, including the last four. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Coach Jim Sollars' team upset No. 1-seeded Santa Clara, 64-58, 
and on Friday shocked Gonzaga in the championship game, 73-65. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland's best player, offensively and defensively, is Amy Claboe, a 6-2 
junior who is averaging 15.7 points and 8.1 rebounds per game. She was named 
most valuable player in the conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the NCAA field is Western Athletic Conference winner San Diego State, 
which completed its best regular season at 25-4, 13-1 in the WAC. On Saturday 
at Salt Lake City, the Aztecs beat Colorado State, 51-47, in the WAC tournament 
title game. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Beth Burns' team, which plays host to Hawaii (25-4) Wednesday in a 
first-round game, has won 19 of its last 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Sites of the four four-team March 24-26 regional tournaments: Piscataway, N.J. 
(East), Fayetteville (Mideast), Austin, Tex. (Midwest) and Palo Alto (West). 
</P>
<P>
 The national semifinals and final will be April 2-3 at Richmond, Va.

UCLA WILL PLAY TULSA; MIDWEST: THE BRUINS ARE SEEDED FIFTH; THE MISSOURI VALLEY 
CONFERENCE REGULAR-SEASON CHAMPION IS NO. 12. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 UCLA got its NCAA tournament assignment Sunday and along with it a geography 
lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins were seeded fifth in the Midwest and will play a first-round game 
Friday in Oklahoma City against 12th-seeded Tulsa of the Missouri Valley 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, the Bruins were clueless about their opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth, I didn't even know Tulsa was in Oklahoma," Ed O'Bannon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't alone. Tyus Edney and Charles O'Bannon didn't know it, either, but 
Coach Jim Harrick said that's nothing to be surprised about. 
</P>
<P>
 "California guys are like that," Harrick said. "They don't know past Yuma, 
Ariz." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the Bruins will know all they want to about the Golden Hurricane of 
Coach Tubby Smith. Tulsa finished the season 21-7 and won the regular season 
MVC title, but lost to Northern Iowa in the conference tournament semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do know this -- both teams are going to bring it," Ed O'Bannon said. "We're 
all excited. It's a goal of ours to reach the ultimate game, the Final Four, so 
this is just one step further to where we want to get." 
</P>
<P>
 There is plenty in the way. If UCLA gets past Tulsa, it will play the winner 
of the Oklahoma State-New Mexico State game. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma State is favored, so the potential for back-to-back games against 
Oklahoma teams in the state capital could be a daunting prospect for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one said it would be easy," Charles O'Bannon said. "It's a tough draw for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 If UCLA wins twice, it is seeded to play No. 1 Arkansas in the Sweet 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have a chance," Ed O'Bannon said. "Nothing in life is easy. For us 
to get where we want to be, we have to do the best we can." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hurricane is a high-scoring, up-tempo and not very tall team. Sophomore 
center J.R. Rollo, at 6 feet 9, is the only starter taller than 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulsa averages 82.4 points and made a school-record 223 three-pointers, led by 
6-4 forward Gary Collier. The MVC's player of the year, Collier averages 22 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulsa has won eight of its last nine games, 15 of its last 18 and is coming 
into the tournament playing consistently, something UCLA cannot say about 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins are only 7-6 since a 14-0 start and were beaten Saturday by Oregon, 
the Pacific 10 Conference's eighth-place team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, we'll kind of wake up a little bit and smell the tournament," Ed 
O'Bannon said. "I guess things happen. We aren't the only team to have ups and 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 Edney said he isn't concerned about the state of the Bruins now that 
tournament time is here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm confident everybody realizes this is a new season," Edney said. "What's 
happened is in the past and we can put that behind us." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick, who said he is "cautiously optimistic" about the Bruins' chances, 
does not think there is any lingering UCLA mystique at his disposal that he can 
use against Tulsa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish there was, but I haven't found there to be too much of that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is in his third year at Tulsa after two years as an assistant to Rick 
Pitino at Kentucky. Smith said Tulsa, which lost to No. 1-ranked Arkansas in 
overtime, 93-91, is excited to be playing UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to see our guys aren't in awe of UCLA," he said. "We've competed 
against the best in the nation." The Pacific Trail

MORNING BRIEFING: BEANED PLAYER'S RETIREMENT PROVED POLITICALLY CORRECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 45 years ago, two promising center fielders began their professional 
baseball careers. 
</P>
<P>
 One, Mickey Mantle, received a signing bonus of $1,100 from the New York 
Yankees. The other, Matt Cuomo, got $2,000 from the Pittsburgh Pirates and was 
assigned to the Brunswick team in the Georgia-Florida League. In 1952, Cuomo 
batted .244 with one home run, 26 runs batted in and seven steals in 81 games, 
before being beaned. 
</P>
<P>
 He retired from the game after that season and entered law school. Mantle is 
now in the Baseball Hall of Fame, while Cuomo, who went back to using his real 
first name, Mario, is in his third term as New York's governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Which candidate for governor of California was an all-Pacific 10 
football player? 
</P>
<P>
 Spreading the word: The Los Angeles Sports Council's "LA Sports" logo, 
according to the Amateur Athletic Foundation's Sports Letter, has brought in 
more than $1 million in nine months in sales of everything from caps, parkas 
and socks to seat covers and tissue boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Priorities: Pittsburgh Post-Gazette columnist Gene Collier calls Buddy Ryan 
"perhaps America's favorite 12-year-old." But he acknowledges the public's 
curiosity about the new Phoenix Cardinal coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "In January of 1991," Collier writes, "the Philadelphia Daily News ran two 
telephone polls, one on the sanctions-or-weapons question that would soon 
trigger the Persian Gulf War, the other on whether Ryan should be retained or 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
 "The war issue drew 1,638 responses. The Ryan question drew 12,359 calls and 
40 faxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Message heard: Ken Head is a Fullerton police captain and owner of the Say No 
to Drugs funny car dragster. He and his driver, Dennis Taylor, recently visited 
the teen-age American Indian ward of the Gila River (Ariz.) Juvenile Detention 
Center. Head told a group of 40 youths about the dangers of drug and alcohol 
abuse and told how his former partner, Tom De La Rosa, was murdered during a 
1990 drug bust. 
</P>
<P>
 Head said he was amazed when one of the teen-agers "came up to me after our 
program and apologized for my partner's death." 
</P>
<P>
 Different views: Keith Agre of Beverly Hills questions a recent Morning 
Briefing item that said the NBA started in 1946. He claims it started in 1949 
as a consolidation of the Basketball Assn. of America and the National 
Basketball League, after a bitter three-year rivalry. Both viewpoints are 
correct; the NBA considers itself the direct descendant of the NBL. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: John Garamendi, California offensive guard in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Larry Himes, Chicago Cub general manager, after hearing the Dodgers 
will pay second-year catcher Mike Piazza $4.2 million for three years: "People 
in baseball consider the Piazza contract a joke. Why would they do that?" SHAV

NO. 3 MICHIGAN LOOMS FOR NO. 14 PEPPERDINE; MIDWEST: BUT THE WAVES ARE SIMPLY 
GLAD TO BE IN THE FIELD AFTER RECOVERING FROM SLOW START TO THEIR SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For most of the season, the biggest question surrounding the Pepperdine 
basketball team wasn't who the Waves would play in the NCAA tournament or what 
seeding they would draw. 
</P>
<P>
 The concern for Coach Tom Asbury was whether or not Pepperdine would make it 
to the tournament at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine had to struggle simply to make it this far, winning its last seven 
games, including three in the West Coast Conference tournament to receive an 
automatic berth. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the pairings were finally announced, Asbury and his team didn't appear 
fazed with the prospect of facing Big Ten power Michigan in the first round of 
the NCAA Midwest Regional at Wichita, Kan., on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the next game?" Asbury joked. "We probably won't look past Michigan 
for a day or so." 
</P>
<P>
 Asbury said he was hoping the Waves (19-10) would be seeded a little higher 
than 14th in their regional and he wasn't looking to play a high-profile team 
such as the third-seeded Wolverines (21-7). 
</P>
<P>
 All things considered, though, he wasn't complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Asbury said, he probably knows a lot more about the Wolverines than 
they know about his team. 
</P>
<P>
 What does Michigan Coach Steve Fisher think about the Waves? 
</P>
<P>
 "I know little or nothing about them," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 That might be the only advantage for Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all of the attention that the Wolverines have received with their 
back-to-back appearances in the NCAA championship game, Pepperdine's players 
are not in awe of their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's because many of the Waves have been to the tournament before. It 
will be the third appearance in four seasons for Pepperdine, which lost to 
Memphis State in the first round of the Midwest Regional in its last appearance 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I think we match up pretty well with them," senior Damin Lopez 
said. "Even if our man-to-man (defense) doesn't work, I think our zone will be 
pretty effective." 
</P>
<P>
 That may be a little too much optimism against a team such as Michigan, even 
after its 97-93 loss to Northwestern at Evanston, Ill., on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan is led by 6-foot-8 junior guard Jalen Rose and 6-9 junior forward 
Juwan Howard. Rose averages 20.6 points and Howard 19.6 points and a 
team-leading 8.3 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a load, and we knew we were going to draw a team like that in our 
first game," Lopez said. "They're a huge name and we're going into the middle 
of basketball country, but we just want to play the game." 
</P>
<P>
 For senior center Derek Noether, the fact that the Waves will be playing 
Michigan in the first round will be an added bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to be easy for us, but that's what it's all about," Noether 
said. "For myself, it just gives you a shot of adrenaline to play a team like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Dana Jones, who led Pepperdine in scoring with an 18.5-point average, 
said the Waves' NCAA tournament experience will work in their favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's normal that everybody's going to be nervous at the start of the game," 
Jones said. "But once we get past that initial nervousness, I think we can play 
with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his limited knowledge of the Waves, Howard promised the Wolverines 
will be ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you that I'll do my homework on Monday," he said.

THE NIT; USC LANDS NIT BERTH AT FRESNO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The call might not have been an invitation to the NCAA tournament, but USC was 
not complaining Sunday night when the Trojans gained a berth in the National 
Invitation Tournament for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans, who won their final four games of the season and five of their 
last six, will play at Fresno State at 9 p.m. Wednesday in the first round of 
the NIT. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very excited about the opportunity to play in the NIT against a quality 
program from a quality league," USC Coach George Raveling said. "While 95% of 
the schools are sitting home right now, we'll have an opportunity to play on 
national television at a time when we're playing with consistency and on a 
little bit of a roll." 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State, which lost to Brigham Young in the second round of the Western 
Athletic Conference Tournament, finished the regular season at 19-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Only four weeks ago, USC looked like a team headed anywhere but a postseason 
tournament with an 11-10 overall record and a disappointing 4-8 mark in the 
Pacific 10 Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the turnaround. In a span of six days, the Trojans ended February 
and began March as the hottest team in the Pac-10 by defeating favored 
California and UCLA at the Sports Arena, before sweeping both Oregon and Oregon 
State this past weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key was that we wanted to finish the season strong," USC senior Mark Boyd 
said. "Once we started winning, it got to the point where we did not want our 
season to end." 
</P>
<P>
 The winner between Fresno State and the Trojans will play the winner of 
Arizona State (15-12), which ended the season by defeating Pac-10 champion 
Arizona, and Brigham Young (21-9), the runner-up in the WAC Tournament 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs start an all-senior lineup headed by 6-foot-3 guard Carl Ray 
Harris, who averaged 21.5 points a game this season, and forward Seth Marshall, 
who averaged 13.6 points and 4.8 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 USC and Fresno State have not played in 65 years, but the Trojans own a 2-0 
record in the series with consecutive victories over the Bulldogs in 1928 and 
1929. 
</P>
<P>
 A key this time might be the play of Lorenzo Orr, a junior forward who carried 
the Trojans to consecutive NIT victories over Nevada Las Vegas and Pepperdine 
last season, before coming up short at Minnesota, the eventual champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're definitely a different team than we were earlier in the season," said 
Orr, who was selected to the all-Pac-10 team last week. "Instead of playing not 
to lose, we are now playing to win." First-Round NIT Pairings 
</P>

Ohio (20-7); North Carolina Charlotte (16-12) at Duquesne (16-12); Texas A&M

<P>
 1. ARKANSAS (25-3) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Corliss Williamson, a 6-7 sophomore forward, is the 
Southeastern Conference player of the year. He averaged 19.7 points, 7.3 
rebounds and made 64.5% of his shots. Arkansas Coach Nolan Richardson says 
Williamson is one of the five best players in the country. Williamson was 
injured during parts of his freshman season, but he has become the major force 
on the nation's No. 1 team. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: In its three seasons in the SEC, Arkansas has won the 
conference title twice. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: No team, including North Carolina, has as much talent as the 
Razorbacks. Williamson is among the country's elite players and forward Scotty 
Thurman isn't far behind. Point guard Corey Beck runs the team with aplomb and 
forward/center Darnell Robinson was recently named to the SEC's all-freshman 
team. And as always, there is Richardson's "40 minutes of hell" -- up-tempo 
offense, constant pressure on defense. Arkansas is the closest thing to a Final 
Four certainty. 2. MASSACHUSETTS (27-6) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Lou Roe, a muscular 6-7 junior forward, gets the call here, 
but not by a large margin. Roe averages 18.6 points and 8.3 rebounds and gives 
the Minutemen an intimidating force. But this a team with three starters in 
double figures (Roe, guard Mike Williams, forward Donta Bright) and another one 
right at the edge (freshman center Marcus Camby). 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: As a favor to ESPN, Coach John Calipari agreed to play a 
Feb. 18 game against Manhattan at midnight. The way Calipari figured it, 
Massachusetts owed it to the network for giving the Minutemen the much-needed 
TV exposure they craved several seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Massachusetts played a tough regular-season schedule, has four 
terrific starters, has some depth on the bench, has a good coach and knows how 
to play defense. 3. MICHIGAN (21-7) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: The Wolverines still have four of the Fab Five, but a Final 
Four is possible only if versatile Jalen Rose can continue his fine play. Rose 
has been a joy to watch during the past month and is having as good an overall 
season as any player in the country. He actually has played better without 
Chris Webber on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Even with the Fab Five last year, Michigan had to grind 
its way to the Final Four. Not counting the blowout of Coastal Carolina, the 
Wolverines advanced to the finals with a two-point overtime victory against 
UCLA, an eight-point victory against George Washington, a five-point victory 
against Temple and a three-point overtime victory against Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The starting five is great. The bench is iffy. If Jimmy King, Ray 
Jackson, Juwan Howard (another key player) and Dugan Fife are on the floor at 
game's end, we like Michigan's chances to go far. Rose has to continue his 
consistent play and Michigan has to get the ball inside to Howard. 4. OKLAHOMA 
STATE (23-9) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Center Bryant Reeves is the star, but Fred Burley, a senior 
forward, could make or break the Cowboys. Reeves and guards Randy Rutherford 
and Brooks Thompson are consistent scorers. Burley, when he plays to his 
potential, helps free up Reeves in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Coach Eddie Sutton has taken four teams -- Oklahoma 
State, Kentucky, Arkansas, Creighton -- to the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Depending how its bracket shakes out, Oklahoma State could do well. 
Its starting five is as good as most, but the bench is suspect. Foul trouble or 
facing a team with a deep bench is bad news for the Cowboys. 5. UCLA (21-6) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Tyus Edney, bad back and all, still runs this team and when 
he struggles, so do the Bruins. The junior point guard can do lots of things: 
hit the three-pointer, penetrate the lane, shoot free throws, play aggressive 
defense and run an offense that often sputters in his absence. If Edney isn't 
able to go by tournament time, the Bruins will have to depend on freshman 
Cameron Dollar, who has yet to start.  
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Marques Johnson, the former UCLA star who now does color 
commentary on the Bruin radio broadcasts, has an interesting dilemma next 
season. After all, how many broadcasters have to analyze the talents of their 
own sons? Kris Johnson, a star at Crenshaw, has signed with the Bruins and 
joins the team next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: If there is a more inconsistent team in the top 25 than UCLA, we'd 
like to see them. On second thought . . . The Bruins defy explanation. At 
times, they look like a team headed toward the Sweet 16. At least they did when 
they beat Louisville not long ago. But in recent weeks, for every victory 
against Louisville, there is a loss against Oregon. A banged-up Edney won't 
help UCLA's chances, but some consistency from Shon Tarver and Ed and Charles 
O'Bannon would. Coach Jim Harrick says the Bruins will be ready for the 
tournament. Maybe so, but right now they look as if they're ready to be upset 
in the first round. The Bruins aren't good enough to phone it in and still win. 
6. TEXAS (25-7) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: There aren't many guards better than B.J. Tyler, who is 
averaging 23.3 points, 6.3 assists and 3.1 steals. With him, the Longhorns 
average about 96 points. Without him, they dip to 78 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Texas is forcing about 23 turnovers per game, a 
remarkable number and one of the main reasons for the Longhorns' second-half 
turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: If Texas can get past the first round, it could cause some damage. 
Not many opponents are used to playing against the Longhorns' style of non-stop 
running, fullcourt pressing and trapping. Texas, which won 15 of its last 16 
regular-season games, will have its problems if it faces a team with big guards 
who can pass over the Longhorn press. 7. SAINT LOUIS (23-5) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Junior guard Erwin Claggett has become the Billikens' go-to 
guy in tight games. If Coach Charlie Spoonhour needs a basket, Claggett gets 
the call. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Saint Louis, which returned all five starters, was picked 
in preseason polls to finish sixth in the seven-team Great Midwest Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Billikens have three solid guards -- Claggett, Scott Highmark 
and H Waldman -- and an undersized forward in Donnie Dobbs, but they don't have 
an inside game to speak of. If Saint Louis isn't hitting its outside shots, 
it's doomed. Example: a loss to last-place Dayton. But Spoonhour is a proven 
winner and Saint Louis has enough talent to beat nearly any team. 8. ILLINOIS 
(17-10) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Fifth-year senior center Deon Thomas is Illinois' all-time 
leading scorer and one of the top 15 scorers in Big Ten history. His 19.6 
scoring average comes the hard way: inside.  
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: In the last six years, 75 of Illinois' 79 players have 
been in-state recruits. This year, all of Illinois' roster players are from 
Illinois, which means one of two things: Coach Lou Henson can't recruit 
nationally or the state of Illinois is loaded with talent. (The answer is No. 
2.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Illini don't play particularly well on the road and they've 
been prone to ups and downs all season. They shoot less than 50% from the field 
and all things considered, have been something of a disappointment -- a fact 
that won't be disputed by Illinois' own players. Still, they have Thomas and 
freshman point guard Kiwane Garris, who is averaging 15.8 points and is 
shooting 81% from the free-throw line. Garris is the only Big Ten freshman ever 
to score 30 points or more in two consecutive games. 9. GEORGETOWN (18-11) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Sophomore center Othella Harrington has continued the 
legacy of Georgetown big men that began with Patrick Ewing and continued with 
Dikembe Mutombo and Alonzo Mourning. Harrington was among the Big East 
Conference leaders in scoring, free-throw percentage, rebounds and blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: The Hoyas have advanced as far as the Sweet 16 only twice 
since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: A Sweet 16 visit this time around would take some doing. Harrington 
gives the Hoyas an intimidating force in the middle and, as always, Georgetown 
plays an aggressive brand of defense. But the Hoyas have trouble scoring points 
and don't shoot three-pointers particularly well. Senior point guard Joey Brown 
provides lots of experience and junior college transfer George Butler, an off 
guard, has come on lately. 10. MARYLAND (16-11) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Freshman center Joe Smith, who was responsible for 
Maryland's first-half successes. Smith earned much more defensive attention 
during the second half and it showed as the Terrapins struggled down the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: This is Maryland's first postseason appearance since 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: A first-round victory wouldn't be a total surprise, but a 
second-round victory would. The Terrapins showed their age (very young) as the 
season wore on and there's no reason to think things will improve during the 
NCAA tournament. Still, this has been a season for Maryland and Coach Gary 
Williams to cherish. 11. WESTERN KENTUCKY (20-10) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Sophomore swingman Chris Robinson is averaging 14.5 points 
and scored 30 against Jacksonville in a Sun Belt Conference tournament 
semifinal victory. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Coach Ralph Willard's son, Kevin, is a freshman reserve 
guard. Kevin scored 18 points in Western Kentucky's 72-71 tournament loss to 
Southwestern Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Western Kentucky, which reached the round of 16 in last year's NCAA 
tournament, will be hard pressed to repeat the feat this season. The 
Hilltoppers, the Sun Belt regular-season champion, have only one senior, 6-6 
Cypheus Bunton. He averages 10.5 points. 12. TULSA (21-7) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Senior Gary Collier, a 6-4 forward, is averaging 22 points 
and 6.9 rebounds. He was the Missouri Valley Conference player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Coach Tubby Smith spent two seasons as an assistant on 
Rick Pitino's Kentucky staff. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Smith is a disciple of Pitino's philosophy of full-court pressure 
and three-point shots. The Golden Hurricane hardly notices the 35-second shot 
clock, what with their up-tempo play. Tulsa has made 223 three-pointers, which 
would make Pitino proud. Don't be fooled by Tulsa's semifinal loss to Northern 
Illinois in the MVC tournament. This is the same team that took Arkansas to 
overtime this season before losing, 93-91. Also in Tulsa's favor is the 
location of its first-round NCAA game against UCLA: nearby Oklahoma City. 13. 
NEW MEXICO STATE (23-7) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Senior forward James Dockery was the Aggies' only returning 
starter from a season ago, but it could have been worse for Coach Neil 
McCarthy. Dockery, 6-8 but a slim 205 pounds, has great leaping ability and a 
soft shooting touch. He scored 23 points against Nevada Las Vegas in the Big 
West Conference semifinals and also had 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: In less than nine seasons, McCarthy is the Aggies' 
all-time winningest coach, long since surpassing the 173 victories by Illinois' 
Henson. McCarthy has 193. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: After ending the regular season with four losses in five games, New 
Mexico State probably needed to win the Big West tournament to earn an NCAA 
invitation. Now that the Aggies have made it, they'll need Dockery to continue 
his fine play. They'll also need a minor miracle to duplicate last year's NCAA 
performance, when the Aggies advanced to the second round. 14. PEPPERDINE 
(19-10) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Senior forward Dana Jones, who is averaging 18.5 points, 
was named the West Coast Conference tournament most valuable player. It marked 
the fourth consecutive season Jones has made the all-tournament team. Jones is 
shooting 56% from the field, hasn't missed a start and also leads the Waves in 
rebounds, steals and blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: An earlier three-game losing streak was the program's 
longest since the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Waves enter the NCAA tournament with a seven-game winning 
streak (their longest of the season) during which they've outscored opponents 
by an average of 14.3 points. Pepperdine is playing excellent defense and Jones 
and senior guard Damin Lopez are dependable scorers. The Waves have lots of 
experience, a solid coach in Tom Asbury and enough to score at least one upset. 
15. SOUTHWEST TEXAS STATE (25-6) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Whenever the Bobcats need an important shot taken, the ball 
finds its way into the hands of Lynwood Wade, a senior forward who averages 
18.6 points and 8.5 rebounds. Wade was recently named the Southland Conference 
tournament most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Two seasons ago, Southwest Texas State could barely win 
seven games. Now it's making its first NCAA appearance. Not bad. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Not good. The Bobcats, who are ranked nationally in 
field-goal-percentage defense and scoring defense, don't have much size. Their 
forwards go 6-4, 6-4 and their point guard is 6-0. 16. NORTH CAROLINA A&T 
(16-13) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Junior guard Phillip Allen. The 6-1 Allen began the season 
as the Aggies' leading returning scorer, which wasn't saying much since he 
averaged only seven points last season. But Allen has responded, as evidenced 
by his play during the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference semifinal against 
Maryland Eastern Shore. Allen scored 19 points, made the game-winning assist to 
Joe Bunn and also forced Eastern Shore's Aaron McKinney to miss a potential 
game-tying three-pointer at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Coach Jeff Capel is the father of Jeff Capel Jr., a 
freshman guard at Duke. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The quintessential thanks-for-stopping-by-the-booth team. One game 
and gone.

<P>
 1. MISSOURI (25-3) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Choose between senior guard Melvin Booker, the Big Eight 
Conference player of the year, or swingman Kelly Thames, the league's freshman 
of the year. Both players are largely responsible for Missouri's success. 
Thames is often compared to Chicago Bull forward Scottie Pippen. Same facial 
expressions. Somewhat similar moves. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Two statistics the Tigers would prefer to forget: Coach 
Norm Stewart's teams are 9-14 in NCAA tournament play and none have reached the 
Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: If senior forward Jevon Crudup, who gives the Tigers an 
intimidating inside presence, can stay out of foul trouble, Missouri could be 
tough to beat. The Tigers have lots of experience (eight seniors), lots of 
depth and unlike most Missouri teams, can shoot the three-pointer. The Tigers 
looked a little shaky as the regular season came to an end, but that might have 
been because of the pressure to finish the Big Eight schedule without a loss 
(they did). 2. ARIZONA (25-5) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Guard Khalid Reeves is the easy choice, what with his 24.1 
scoring average. But keep an eye on Reggie Geary, the excitable and exciting 
sophomore guard who almost always is assigned to the other's team best 
offensive player. Geary held Michigan's Jalen Rose to 12 points and, before he 
fouled out, caused all sorts of problems for Lamond Murray of California. It 
was no accident that as soon as Geary left the game, Murray began scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: During the last seven seasons, Arizona has an .841 
winning percentage, the nation's highest. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Arizona has one of the best backcourts in the country with Reeves 
and Damon Stoudamire, but they don't have a high-scoring small forward, 
something of a rarity for a Lute Olson-coached team. Instead, they have the 
defensive-minded Geary at that spot. As usual, Olson has done an admirable job 
during the regular season. Now he needs to re-establish his postseason 
credentials. The Wildcats lost each of their last two opening NCAA matchups. 3. 
LOUISVILLE (26-5) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: North Carolina's loss has been Louisville's gain as former 
Tar Heel Clifford Rozier continues to establish himself as one of the best 
centers in the nation. He recently named as one of five finalists for the U.S. 
Basketball Writers Assn.'s player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Louisville's NCAA record of 46 consecutive winning 
seasons, established from 1944-1990, was matched by UCLA this season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: A strange but often wonderful team, the Cardinals are good enough 
to go long and far . . . and inconsistent enough to lose in the first round. We 
like their chances to go far, but only if they keep their starters out of foul 
trouble and shoot reasonably well from the perimeter. Louisville has a thin 
bench, but its starters, especially Rozier and senior guard Greg Minor (who 
ranks among the top 10 in six of the top 10 statistical categories in the Metro 
Conference), are golden. 4. SYRACUSE (21-6) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Junior Lawrence Moten doesn't jump that well, doesn't run 
that fast, doesn't dazzle anyone with dunks. But CBS basketball analyst Billy 
Packer calls Moten one of the smartest players he's seen in recent years. 
Packer will get no argument from Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim, who has seen Moten 
(20.7 scoring average) distinguish himself as a Big East all- conference 
selection in each of the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Moten was a high school teammate of Syracuse quarterback 
Marvin Graves. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Orangemen don't have much depth, but they do have three 
excellent players in swingman Moten, guard Adrian Autry and forward John 
Wallace. All three are among the top 10 scorers in the Big East. How will it 
translate in the NCAA tournament? Sweet 16 sounds about right. 5. CALIFORNIA 
(22-7) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Jason Kidd not only is the player to watch, he's the player 
to gawk at. The sophomore guard (soon to be NBA rookie) is the only player in 
Pacific 10 Conference history to record four triple-doubles. He leads the 
nation in assists (about 9.5 per game) and is averaging 16.8 points (nearly 
four points higher than last season's average) and 6.6 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: The Golden Bears' record is even more impressive 
considering that Coach Todd Bozeman has only seven scholarship players 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: If the Golden Bears can stay out of foul trouble and not dip into 
their iffy bench -- a big if -- they could reach the Final Eight. Kidd has no 
peer at guard and forward Lamond Murray (24.1-point average, 48% shooting) is a 
star in his own right. Cal also needs contributions from swingman Monty Buckley 
(13.1 points) and center Ryan Jamison (7.5 points). If it happens, watch out. 
Kidd might get his going-away wish: a trip to the Final Four. 6. MINNESOTA 
(20-11) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Guard Voshon Lenard is one of the 10 best guards in the 
country. Case closed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: In the last three seasons, the Golden Gophers have won 
only seven Big Ten Conference road games. And all came against Northwestern, 
Wisconsin or Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: We had high hopes for Minnesota, but it is obvious that the Golden 
Gophers are a different team when they have to pack a suitcase and go on the 
road. Sure they won the NIT last year, but the first three games were at home. 
The NCAA isn't so generous. For Minnesota to have a chance at a title run, 
Lenard can't afford a poor shooting night. Forwards Randy Carter and Chad 
Kolander also have to contribute in a big way. A Sweet 16 team, but the Gophers 
should have been better. 7. VIRGINIA (17-12) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Junior forward Junior Burrough became the centerpiece to 
Virginia's offense when star guard Cory Alexander suffered an injury during the 
season. Without the gifted Alexander, Burrough, like the entire Cavalier team, 
has struggled. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: The Virginia roster includes senior guard Chris Havlicek, 
son of former Boston Celtic star John Havlicek. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Cavaliers were hard-pressed to earn an NCAA invitation and 
don't figure to last long. Barring the unexpected return of Alexander -- and 
even then, how good could he be? -- Virginia is probably destined for 
one-game-and-out status. At times, an ugly team to watch. 8. CINCINNATI (22-9) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Freshman Dontonio Wingfield is the obvious choice, but 
we'll pick guard Lazelle Durden. If Durden, who gives the Bearcats a perimeter 
game, is making his outside shots, things get much easier inside for Wingfield. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Three of Cincinnati's starters were named to the 
conference's all-newcomer team. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Very young, but very talented. The kind of team that is capable of 
an upset or two . . . or getting blown out. The Bearcats have a problem 
concentrating for 40 minutes, a must in tournament play. 9. WISCONSIN (17-10) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Junior forward Michael Finley and freshman center Rashard 
Griffith both deserve mention. Finley hasn't had quite the season everyone 
expected, but then again, everyone expected so much after his All-Big Ten 
Conference selection last year. As for the 6-11, 265-pound Griffith, he 
certainly doesn't look like a freshman. Or play like one, either. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: The Badgers haven't been to the NCAA tournament since 
1947. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Wisconsin enters the tournament with six losses in eight games, 
which is the wrong kind of momentum. But the Badgers survived a grueling Big 
Ten schedule and scored their share of upsets. 10. NEW MEXICO (23-7) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Only 5-7, senior point guard Greg Brown averages 19.9 
points and was recently named Western Athletic Conference player of the year. 
Born and raised in Albuquerque, Brown has made Coach Dave Bliss a very happy 
man. The reason: Brown has bumped up his scoring average more than 10 points 
from last season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: This is New Mexico's eighth consecutive 20-victory 
season. Only three other teams have longer streaks: North Carolina, Syracuse 
and Duke. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Lobos lead the nation in three-pointers, which makes sense 
since they don't have much of an inside game. Maybe good for two tournament 
victories -- tops. 11. SOUTHERN ILLINOIS (23-6) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: A tough call simply because Southern Illinois is so 
balanced. If you had to pick someone, it would probably be guard Paul Lusk, who 
is averaging 15.4 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Lusk, who transferred from Iowa, is a former roommate of 
Hawkeye star Chris Street, who died in an automobile accident in January of 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Southern Illinois has five players in double figures, including 
Lusk and forwards Marcus Timmons and Chris Carr. Timmons is a legitimate NBA 
prospect. The Salukis are a strong rebounding team and have held opponents to 
43.2% shooting. But they also are prone to turnovers -- a no-no in the 
tournament. 12. WISCONSIN GREEN BAY (26-6) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: After a so-so freshman season, Jeff Nordgaard has 
established himself as Green Bay's first offensive choice. The sophomore 
forward/center averaged only six points last season, but has since increased 
his average to 15.3 and added 6.3 rebounds per game. In 17 of the Phoenix's 
last 20 games, Nordgaard has been the leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Since the NCAA expanded the tournament field to 64, 
Wisconsin Green Bay is the first team to win 25 games but not receive a bid to 
the tournament. It happened in 1991-92, when the Phoenix finished 25-4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: This isn't the most athletic team you'll ever see. But conference 
opponents rave about how smart the Phoenix play. Nationally ranked in team 
scoring defense and field-goal defense, the Phoenix make opponents work for 
their points. A first-round victory is unlikely. Then again, so is a blowout 
loss. The Phoenix play most teams tough. 13. HAWAII (18-14) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Senior guard Trevor Ruffin, a streak shooter if you ever 
saw one. Example: After scoring only six points in the first half of Saturday's 
victory over Brigham Young in the Western Athletic Conference tournament final, 
Ruffin pumped in five three-pointers. In all, he made six of 11 second-half 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Hawaii is the first NCAA tournament entry not to come 
from the 48 contiguous states. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Rainbows played a tough nonconference schedule (North Carolina, 
among others) and have some size and a decent backcourt. The kind of team that 
could sneak up on someone. BYU, which blew a 14-point lead against the 
Rainbows, can attest to that. 14. BOISE STATE (17-12) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Senior forward Shambric Williams, a sometime starter last 
season, has established himself as an offensive force this season. Williams 
scored 27 points in the Big Sky Conference tournament final and was named the 
tournament's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: The Broncos lucked out big time when conference officials 
named the Boise State Pavilion as site of the conference tournament. The 
home-court advantage helped the Broncos defeat three higher-seeded opponents as 
they earned the improbable NCAA bid. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Williams can score another 27 in the first-round NCAA tournament 
game, but it won't matter. The Broncos are fortunate to be here. Alas, no more 
home-court advantage. 15. LOYOLA (Md.) (17-12) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Two players are the key for Loyola's slim upset chances -- 
Michael Reese, a 6-8 senior forward who averages 20.3 points, and point guard 
Tracy Bergan, who averages 17.6 points and was recently named the most valuable 
player of the Metro Atlantic Conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Loyola Coach Skip Prosser, who helped Pete Gillen rebuild 
the Xavier program, is a graduate of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy -- not 
exactly the birthplace of college basketball coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Dreadful. Reese is the tallest starter and Loyola lacks any sort of 
bulk inside. The Greyhounds shot lots of three-pointers and made 33%. They'll 
have to do better than that if they plan to stay close. 16. NAVY (17-12) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Junior guard T.J. Hall, the only returning Navy player with 
backcourt experience, has become the Midshipmen's leading scorer, averaging 
13.7 points. During Navy's recent seven-game winning streak, Hall averaged 21. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: After an 8-19 record last season, second-year Coach Don 
DeVoe has Navy back in the tournament for the first time since 1987, when David 
Robinson was at Annapolis. How big of a turnaround is it? Navy's last five 
seasons included victory totals of eight, six, eight, five and six. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Navy, which has won 12 of its last 14 games, has 10 players who 
average five points or more. The Midshipmen out-rebound opponents by five per 
game and feature the No. 1 defense in the Patriot League. Of course, it is the 
Patriot League we're talking about. Still, DeVoe and Navy deserve a round of 
polite applause before their first-round loss.

<P>
 1. NORTH CAROLINA (27-6) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Tar Heel officials still can't believe that guard Derrick 
Phelps didn't make the Atlantic Coast Conference's first team. He averages a 
modest 9.4 points, but he is the emotional leader and the team's best defensive 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: This is only the third time since 1962 that the Tar Heels 
didn't have a first-team player on the all-conference list. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: People forget that North Carolina lost seven of the 14 players on 
last season's championship team (five graduated, two redshirted). Also 
forgotten is that the Tar Heels had to win four close games to win the NCAA 
title. It also helped that Michigan's Chris Webber called a timeout he didn't 
have. Coach Dean Smith has the most roster talent of any team in the country, 
but he doesn't always have the best team chemistry. Freshman center Rasheed 
Wallace is getting more playing time, which is good, and guard Donald Williams 
has shown flashes of his old self. But the Tar Heels don't always play with the 
necessary intensity or togetherness needed to win a championship. A Final Four 
visit? Probably. An NCAA title. No way. 2. CONNECTICUT (27-4) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Junior forward Donyell Marshall will be in the NBA next 
season. The Big East Conference player of the year is averaging 25.5 points and 
3.4 blocks. He was also named the league's defensive player of the year. 
Nicknamed "Yell" by Coach Jim Calhoun (because Marshall rarely raises his 
voice, or something like that), Marshall dominated opponents during all-star 
play last summer and hasn't stopped since. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: The Huskies, who have no scholarship seniors on the 
roster, won the Big East regular-season title outright for the first time since 
the 1989-90 season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Calhoun has a star in Marshall and the impressive Doron Sheffer at 
point guard. Sheffer, from Israel, is unflappable, which is a big plus in the 
postseason. The Huskies have lots of quality backups and the whole team plays 
defense. Connecticut, which has never reached the Final Four, came close in 
1990 (Duke's Christian Laettner beat the Huskies in the regional final). A sure 
Final Eight team this time around. 3. FLORIDA (25-7) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Junior guard Dan Cross has been one of the surprise players 
of the season. Florida Coach Lon Krueger says Cross has gotten better each game 
and his numbers reflect it. Cross, who averages 15.9 points, shoots nearly 49% 
from the three-point line and 86.1% from the free-throw line, is the main 
reason why Florida won the SEC Eastern Division. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Just think how good Florida would have been had heralded 
Kansas transfer Ben Davis not been dismissed from the team during the 
off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Never underestimate Krueger, the SEC coach of the year, and this 
very solid team. With Cross and Craig Brown in the backcourt, Florida has one 
of the better tandems in the country. The Gators didn't finish in front of 
Kentucky in the standings by accident. They're capable of winning at least two 
tournament games. 4. TEMPLE (22-7) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Two here: guard Eddie Jones, the Atlantic 10 Conference 
player of the year, and guard Aaron McKie, who won conference 
player-of-the-year honors last season. Jones averages 19.2 points and 6.9 
rebounds, while McKie, who scored 33 points against Massachusetts in the 
conference tournament final, averages 18.7 points and 7.1 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Temple is the seventh-winningest team in Division I 
history with 1,415 victories. The top seven: North Carolina, Kentucky, Kansas, 
St. John's, Duke, Oregon State and Temple. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Despite stumbling a bit down the stretch, this is still a very good 
team, one that could reach the Final Eight. To get there, the Owls need McKie 
and Jones to do what they always do -- score a lot and hit the boards -- and 
guard Rick Brunson to do what he used to, that is, start hitting the 
three-pointer (he was one for 12 against Massachusetts last week). It also 
would help if the Owls could establish the semblance of an inside game. Temple 
Coach John Chaney says it is "one-and-done time." The Owls usually shine in the 
postseason and this year should be no different. Five of their seven losses 
came against Atlantic 10 opponents who were familiar with their matchup zone. 
Temple went 8-2 against nonconference opponents, including victories against 
Louisville, Kansas, Alabama Birmingham, Villanova and Cincinnati. 5. INDIANA 
(19-8) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Senior guard Damon Bailey is probably the choice, edging 
forward Alan Henderson. Bailey is third in the Big Ten Conference in scoring 
(21.5), as well as fourth in free-throw and three-point percentage. He has had 
a career year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: The Hoosiers wins lots of games because of their ability 
to get to the foul line. In past years, Indiana made more free throws than its 
opponents have attempted. Not this season. Also, entering the final few days of 
the regular season, the Hoosiers' number of free-throw attempts and made free 
throws was markedly higher in victories than in losses (31 attempts, 23.7 made 
in victories vs. 20.3 attempts, 13.9 made in defeats). 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Bailey has a hip-pointer, guard Pat Graham has a bad foot, forward 
Brian Evans wears a brace on his shoulder. The Hoosiers stumbled into the 
postseason and have lost games because of injuries and just plain lousy 
defense. The lag time between season's end and tournament's beginning will help 
the Hoosiers a lot. A Sweet 16 appearance isn't impossible, but a Final Eight 
game might be. 6. NEBRASKA (20-9) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: None other than the Polish Rifle, senior forward Eric 
Piatkowski, who averages 21.6 points. When Piatkowski is on, the Cornhuskers 
are capable of challenging any team. They nearly beat Missouri at season's end, 
partly because of Piatkowski. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Sophomore guard Erick Strickland, Nebraska's best 
defensive player and its first option off the bench, is one of the Florida 
Marlins' top minor-league prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Cornhuskers love to shoot the three-pointer. When they hit it, 
they're a formidable team. When they don't (they were two of 26 against 
Missouri this season), they almost always lose. 7. ALABAMA BIRMINGHAM (22-7) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: When 6-9 senior center Clarence Thrash is hitting his soft 
left-handed baby hook, the Blazers are nearly impossible to beat. Thrash is one 
of the more underrated low-post players in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Coach Gene Bartow has taken two teams to the Final Four: 
UCLA and Memphis State. Bartow has said that at times, the Blazers have played 
Final Four-caliber defense. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: A streaky team, which means they could win a few or get knocked out 
in the first round, which is what happened to the Blazers at the Great Midwest 
Conference tournament. We figure they're gone after the first round. 8. 
WASHINGTON STATE (20-10) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Sophomore forward Mark Hendrickson, a member of last year's 
Pacific 10 Conference all-freshman team, sat out a lot this season because of 
injuries. Now he is back in the lineup and with him, the Cougars have something 
of an inside game to complement the backcourt of Eddie Hill and Tony Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: With Saturday's victory against California, Coach Kelvin 
Sampson surpassed the .500 career mark at Washington State. His record: 103-102 
during seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: After the Cougars worked so hard for so many seasons to reach the 
NCAA tournament, you wonder if there might a letdown. We doubt it. Washington 
State is a good team, especially since it can balance the perimeter firepower 
of Hill and Harris with the inside play of Hendrickson and 6-9 Tony Ferguson. A 
victory or two wouldn't surprise us. 9. BOSTON COLLEGE (20-10) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Bill Curley, the blue-collar player personified. The senior 
center averages 20.3 points and 8.9 rebounds and has established himself as a 
hard-working, fundamentally sound inside player with the ability to 
occasionally hit the outside jumper. In each of his four years at Boston 
College, Curley has led the team in scoring and rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Point guard Howard Eisley was a high school teammate of 
Michigan's Jalen Rose and Minnesota's Voshon Lenard. Boston College didn't know 
about Eisley until someone sent a videotape of him to Coach Jim O'Brien. Now 
Eisley is the league's leading three-point shooter and he's never missed a 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: As far as Curley can carry the Eagles, which might be one victory. 
Not much of a bench, but Boston College plays an unorthodox style that could 
cause teams problems. The Eagles' other problem: they get pushed around by 
physical teams. 10. GEORGE WASHINGTON (17-11) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Sophomore center Yinka Dare can be a dominating inside 
force at times, an invisible man on others. During the last week of the regular 
season, Dare averaged 20 points and 18 rebounds. Then George Washington played 
Temple, which barely has an inside game, and Dare missed all four of his shots 
and had only seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: This is only Dare's third season of playing organized 
basketball. He came to the Colonials from Kabba, Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Colonials were the second-best defensive team in the Atlantic 
10 and they have four players who can make the three-point shot -- a must come 
tournament time. What they don't have is a legitimate power forward who can 
help take some of the pressure off Dare. Marcus Ford, a 6-7 guard, has been 
moved to that position, but at 215 pounds, the wear and tear is beginning to 
show. Nonetheless, Mike Jarvis knows how to coach in the NCAAs (the Colonials 
advanced to the West Regional semifinals last season and nearly upset Michigan) 
and Dare isn't likely to have another goose-egg effort. A team to be reckoned 
with. 11. PENNSYLVANIA (24-2) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Junior guard Jerome Allen averages 14 points and leads the 
Quakers with 117 assists. Last season, he became the first sophomore in Ivy 
League history to win conference player-of-the-year honors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Penn advanced to the Final Four in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Quakers only lost to Massachusetts by four points in the first 
round of last year's tournament. Penn isn't a big team -- its tallest starter 
is 6-8 -- but it can run and knows how to make the perimeter shot. Much more 
athletic than you might expect from an Ivy League team. 12. OHIO (25-7) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Sophomore Gary Trent, a 6-7 forward who clinched the NCAA 
bid for the Bobcats, is the best player in the Mid-American Conference. He 
scored 22 points in the MAC tournament championship game against Miami of Ohio 
and also collected 12 rebounds. He averaged 25.7 points and 10.8 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: For the first time in Trent's two-year college career, 
his father was able to see him play on television. Dexter Trent is a prisoner 
at the Ashland (Ky.) Federal Correctional Institution, where he is expected to 
be released in May after serving eight years on drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: We wouldn't want to play them in the first round. Trent is a 
special player and the Bobcats have experience and size on their side. 13. 
DREXEL (25-4) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Sophomore Malik Rose is among thee nation's leaders in 
rebounds (12.6 per game) and averages 14.3 points. The 6-7, 250-pound Rose was 
the North Atlantic Conference tournament most valuable player and earned 
All-NAC honors for the second consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Drexel was the only Philadelphia school to heavily 
recruit Rose, a Philly native. Villanova and Temple all but ignored him. Since 
then, Rose has established himself as one of the country's most relentless 
rebounding forwards. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Unfortunately for Drexel, Rose is the Dragons' tallest starter. 
With All-NAC selection Brian Holden (16.6 points per game) in the backcourt, 
Drexel has a good perimeter attack, but will it be enough to earn a first-round 
upset? Doubtful. 14. JAMES MADISON (20-9) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Only 6-7, Clayton Ritter takes turns at center and forward. 
A first-team all-conference selection, Ritter averages 18 points, 7.6 rebounds 
and shoots 62.8% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: This is the first time James Madison has played in the 
NCAA tournament since 1983, when Lou Campanelli was the coach. This is also the 
first time in eight years Lefty Driesell has coached an NCAA tournament team. 
Driesell is one of only 11 coaches to take three schools to the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Dukes could win a first-round game, but only if they keep 
shooting well. Ranked close to the top 10 in field-goal percentage, James 
Madison has little margin for error, especially with its smallish lineup that 
is outrebounded by an average of 2.3. 15. RIDER (21-8) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Forward Charles Smith, the first freshman to win the 
Northeast Conference tournament most-valuable-player award. Among Division I 
freshmen, Smith was fourth in scoring (17.0) and 14th in rebounding (7.2). 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Senior guard Mark Wilcox scored his 1,000th collegiate 
point Feb. 3, 1994. On Feb. 3, 1990, Wilcox scored his 1,000th point as a high 
school player. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Rider lost, 96-52, in a first-round game against Kentucky last 
season. You get the picture. Rider's tallest starter is 6-7. The Broncs run the 
court well, but that won't be nearly enough. 16. LIBERTY (18-11) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Peter Aluma, a 6-10 freshman center from Lagos, Nigeria, 
entered the recent Big South Conference tournament with a 6.5 scoring average 
and a modest consecutive-shots-made streak. By the time the tournament ended, 
Aluma had made 28 of 32 shots over a six-game span. Along the way, he set a 
school record with 15 consecutive made shots. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Founded by Jerry Falwell, Liberty is making its first 
NCAA tournament appearance since joining Division I in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Aluma, who comes off the bench, joins 6-9 forward Jason Dixon to 
form a solid frontline. The Flames also have point guard Matt Hildebrand, a 
first-team all-conference selection. Too bad it won't matter. One game and out.

<P>
 1. PURDUE (26-4) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Forward Glenn Robinson is the player of the year, but 
swingman Cuonzo Martin is the player who could determine just how far the 
Boilermakers advance in the tournament. A terrible three-point shooter in his 
first two seasons, Martin has become one of the Big Ten Conference's best. 
Martin is also an accomplished defensive player. A quiet leader. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Robinson says that if there was a pickup game and you had 
to choose between him and Martin. . . Martin would be the first pick. Trust us, 
we'd take Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The only criticism of Robinson this season has been his shot 
selection. Otherwise, "Big Dog" has no peer. He can do just about everything, 
and that includes leading Purdue to the Final Eight. Robinson, who averages 
more than 30 points a game, needs some help, though. Indiana, for instance, 
figured Robinson would get his points and instead concentrated on stopping 
Martin and guard Matt Waddell. It worked, too. Purdue Coach Gene Keady is smart 
enough to adjust and the Boilermakers are good enough to make it to the 
regional final. 2. DUKE (23-5) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Who else? Grant Hill, the senior swingman who can do 
everything and do it with grace. Hill averages 17.1 points, 6.3 rebounds and 
leads the team in assists. During the regular season he scored in double 
figures 23 of 26 games. And even when he doesn't score in double digits, Hill 
can control a game. The Blue Devils were 3-0 in those contests in which he 
scored fewer than 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Hill is the eighth player in school history to have his 
jersey number retired. The two before him: Bobby Hurley and Christian Laettner, 
teammates from Duke's NCAA championship seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: As usual, Duke doesn't beat itself. Hill is an elite player who is 
complemented well by the likes of center Cherokee Parks, forward Tony Lang, 
swingman Marty Clark and guards Chris Collins and Jeff Capel. But for Coach 
Mike Krzyzewski's team to advance to the Final Four, someone other than Hill is 
going to have to assert himself. Krzyzewski has done an impressive job of 
hiding Duke's weaknesses, but a trip to Charlotte will take some doing. 3. 
KENTUCKY (26-6) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Sophomore forward Rodrick Rhodes can have monster weeks, 
like the one he had entering the Southeastern Conference tournament (average of 
21.0 points, 6.0 rebounds, 3.5 assists), or he can sometimes disappear. Coach 
Rick Pitino has tried everything to pull more consistent performances out of 
the talented Rhodes. This year it showed. Rhodes is averaging 14.9 points and 
was named to the SEC third team. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: During the recruiting process, Rhodes reportedly asked 
Pitino to promise he wouldn't take another coaching job. Rhodes got his 
promise, Pitino got his player. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Kentucky isn't a team of stars. Point guard Travis Ford was an 
all-SEC second team selection and Rhodes and guard Tony Delk were third-team 
picks. But the Wildcats score lots of points, play decent defense, can bury the 
threes (8.5 per game) and have one of the best coaches in the business. Pitino 
says he likes Kentucky's chances to make some tournament noise. We believe him. 
4. KANSAS (25-7) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: When junior center Greg Ostertag puts his mind to it, he 
can dominate a game. And therein lies the problem: he doesn't put his mind to 
it all the time. That explains why the Jayhawks have looked unbeatable at times 
(Ostertag outplayed Oklahoma State's Bryant Reeves, who was a Big Eight first 
teamer), mediocre at other times. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: While jogging in Lawrence, Kansas Coach Roy Williams will 
run through the cemetery where basketball legends Phog Allen and James Naismith 
are buried. As he passes their markers, he rubs the headstones. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Williams is 11-4 in NCAA tournament play, so you know he can coach 
in big games. But the Jayhawks need Ostertag to play tough every game. Freshman 
forward/center Scot Pollard has played well in the last month and forward 
Richard Scott, a key inside player, is relatively healthy. Another Jayhawk 
must: the ability of Steve Woodberry, Sean Pearson and freshman Jacque Vaughn 
to hit the perimeter shots. None of this is out of the question for Kansas. Nor 
is a Sweet 16 appearance. 5. WAKE FOREST (20-11) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Junior guard Randolph Childress is the reason for Wake 
Forest's surprising season. A first-team all-Atlantic Coast Conference 
selection, Childress has been bothered by a bruised shoulder for the last 
several weeks. When healthy, Childress is one of the league's top scoring 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Before Makhtar Ndiaye was ruled ineligible at Wake Forest 
and transferred to Michigan, the Demon Deacons had three freshmen foreigners 
(Ndiaye from Senegal, Tim Duncan from the U.S. Virgin Islands and Ricardo Peral 
from Spain). Duncan, by the way, was named to the all-ACC freshmen team. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: With Childress in the lineup, this actually is a pretty good team, 
good enough to win a first-round game. The key is their outside shooting. When 
the perimeter shots are falling, Wake Forest is very tough. But if the outside 
shots are clanging, or if Coach Dave Odom has to depend on his bench, the Demon 
Deacons will be reduced to actual praying. 6. MARQUETTE (22-8) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Last year it was guard Tony Miller. This year it is senior 
Jim McIlvane, a 7-1 center who leads the nation in blocked shots and was 
recently named the Great Midwest Conference's most valuable player. If McIlvane 
ever learns how to develop a more varied offensive game, he'll be dangerous. 
McIlvane is vital to the Warriors because the team lives off defense. According 
to DePaul Coach Joey Meyer, McIlvane erases a lot of Marquette mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Coach Kevin O'Neill says he has seen replays of 
Marquette's 1977 national championship just about every time he attends a 
Warrior booster function. If he had his way he'd burn every videotaped copy of 
the game. One problem: sitting on his bench is a constant reminder of the 1977 
season, former Warrior player Bo Ellis, now a Marquette assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Up-tempo trapping and pressing teams cause the Warriors lots of 
matchup problems. If Marquette can keep the score in the 60s and keep it to a 
halfcourt game, they have a chance to win a couple. 7. MICHIGAN STATE (19-11) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Junior guard Shawn Respert is averaging close to 24 points 
and the main reason for Michigan State's late-season victory surge. Respert can 
hit from anywhere and the Spartans do everything they can to get him the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Coach Judd Heathcote is rumored to be considering 
retirement after this season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Nobody knew how good the Spartans would be at season's beginning. 
Respert was the only offensive threat and point guard Eric Snow couldn't make a 
foul shot to save his life. But Snow has become the surprise player in the Big 
Ten (he leads the conference in assists) and senior Anthony Miller is third in 
rebounding. Fast finishes usually mean something and few teams are playing 
better than the Spartans these days. Good for at least one victory, maybe two. 
8. PROVIDENCE (20-9) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: If there is a rebound to be had, senior forward Michael 
Smith will likely get it. He set a Big East rebound record, which put him ahead 
of Syracuse legend Derrick Coleman. Smith is averaging 11.6 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Though the NCAA issued no official word, Providence was 
the last team to be bumped from the tournament bubble last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Friars finished the regular season on a strong note, which is 
something to consider. Providence can bang and run, what with Smith and forward 
Eric Williams, a junior college transfer who can score lots of points. One area 
of concern: junior forward Franklin Western, the team's leading scorer, is 
nursing an injured ankle. 9. ALABAMA (19-9) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Freshman center Antonio McDyess, a third-team 
all-Southeastern Conference selection who averages 8.0 rebounds, 1.4 blocks and 
shoots 57.8% from the field. Actually, the 6-9 McDyess is more of a forward, 
but he is so talented that Coach David Hobbs was able to keep him in the low 
post and get away with it. A star of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Jamal Faulkner, the 1991 Pacific 10 Conference freshman 
of the year, now plays for the Crimson Tide. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Alabama won eight of its last nine regular season games, thanks to 
the play of McDyess, Faulkner and Jason Caffey. Lots of potential, especially 
on the defensive side. A very athletic team, but one that sometimes has 
difficulty scoring many points. Keep an eye on the Crimson Tide. 10. SETON HALL 
(17-12) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Senior forward Arturas Karnishovas, who leads the team with 
an 18.2 scoring average. He also averages 6.7 rebounds. He was named to he 
All-Big East Conference Second Team. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: This is Seton Hall's fourth consecutive NCAA tournament 
appearance. The Pirates reached the championship game in 1989, losing to 
Michigan in overtime, 80-79. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Before losing to Georgetown in the Big East tournament semifinal, 
the Pirates had won four consecutive games and six of their last seven. Besides 
Karnishovas, sophomore forward Adrian Griffin has also come on strong. He leads 
the team in rebounds with a 7.8 average. 11. SOUTHWESTERN LOUISIANA (22-7) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Senior point guard Michael Allen has NBA shooting range, 
can run an offense to perfection and knows how to penetrate the lane. He 
averages 22.7 points and 5.1 assists and is durable. He played 40 minutes in 20 
of the Ragin' Cajuns' 29 games. Allen was the Sun Belt Conference player of the 
year and also the league tournament's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: In their last 10 games against Big Eight Conference and 
Southeastern Conference opponents, the Ragin' Cajuns are 9-1. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Southwestern Louisiana has an impressive perimeter game, what with 
its four top scorers being guards. Allen is a star and 6-6 forward Shawn 
Griggs, a defensive specialist, leads the nation in steals (119). The Ragin' 
Cajuns have forced more turnovers than their opponents in all 29 game, but they 
finished last in rebounding in conference play. 12. COLLEGE OF CHARLESTON 
(24-3) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Point guard Marion Busby, who averages 16.5 points and was 
named player of the year in the Trans-America Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little known fact: Because of conference rules regarding teams moving from 
NAIA status to Division I, the Cougars were ineligible to compete in the Trans 
America league tournament. They could only earn an NCAA bid as an at-large 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Cougars have won 16 consecutive games. Their last loss came 
Jan. 13 against conference foe Central Florida, which also qualified for the 
NCAA tournament. Helping Charleston's postseason chances is the return of 
forward Rodney Conner, a forward who returns after sitting out all but three 
games because of thumb surgery performed Dec. 18. Before his injury, Conner was 
averaging 19.7 points. The Cougars will need all the help they can get against 
a very tough Wake Forest team. 13. TENNESSEE CHATTANOOGA (23-6) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Chap Copeland, a 5-11 senior guard who transferred from 
Florida State, has won just about every award the Southern Conference has to 
offer. Copeland, who averages 20.7 points, 3.6 assists and 2.9 rebounds, is the 
league's most valuable player in both regular and postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Only a Division I program since 1977, this is Tennessee 
Chattanooga's 11th 20-victory season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Moccasins are a great free-throw shooting team and they don't 
panic when down by double digits. They don't have much of a low-post game, but 
Copeland, who could play anywhere, gives them a dangerous backcourt. They won't 
go easily. 14. TENNESSEE STATE (19-11) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Center Carlos Rogers, a two-time Ohio Valley Conference 
player of the year, is averaging 24.8 points, 11.6 rebounds and 3.0 blocks. The 
6-11 senior, who is shooting 61.7% from the field, is the only player in 
Division I to rank in the top 20 in four statistical categories.  
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: The school is alma mater of Oprah Winfrey and Wilma 
Rudolph. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Everything rests on the shoulders of Rogers. It also would help if 
Tennessee State could learn to hit its free throws. As a team, the Tigers are 
shooting 64.6%. 15. TEXAS SOUTHERN (19-10) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: Guard Kevin Granger was the Southwestern Athletic 
Conference freshman of the year and his sophomore season has been even better. 
Along with senior guard Theon Dotson, Granger helps give the Tigers enough 
backcourt offense to cause problems for any team. An example: Granger had 24 
points and Dotson 19 in Texas Southern's SWAC semifinal victory against 
Southern Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: Coach Robert Moreland has won 581 games during his 
30-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: If only the Tigers' frontcourt was as good as the backcourt. Not an 
office pool upset favorite. 16. CENTRAL FLORIDA (21-8) 
</P>
<P>
 * Player to watch: That's easy -- the player with the nation's best nickname: 
Ochiel (Never Maybe) Swaby, a 6-7 junior forward who is averaging 18.5 points 
and 6.0 rebounds. Swaby, a transfer from Miami, hit three game-winning shots 
for Central Florida this season, two of them on four-point plays. Swaby is 
accustomed to scoring lots of points. In 1990-91, he led the nation as a high 
school senior with a 47.4 average. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little-known fact: This is only Central Florida's first winning season since 
becoming a Division I member 10 years ago. So what happens? The Knights earn an 
NCAA bid. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: As this year's Trans America Conference sacrificial lamb, the 
Knights had better enjoy the moment. Central Florida has four players in double 
figures, but its center is 6-6.BASKETBALL TOURNAMENTS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oksana Baiul, the Olympic and world champion, will not compete in figure 
skating's World Championships next week in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Baiul's withdrawal leaves the women's singles competition without its top two 
stars. Nancy Kerrigan earlier announced she is too tired to compete again so 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers gave no reason for Baiul's withdrawal, but she had complained of 
back pain and pain in her lower leg after a collision during practice at the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ukrainian team will replace the 16-year-old Baiul with Inna Vayets.

 Bonnie Blair, the gold medalist in the 500 meters at the Winter Olympics, 
finished third at that distance in the second day of a World Cup speedskating 
competition at Inzell, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair swept to an easy victory in the first 500 meters on Saturday. But in 
Sunday's race she was edged by Monique Garbrecht and Franziska Schenk, both of 
Germany. "Some things you can't explain," Blair said. "But you can't always 
stay in top form." 
</P>
<P>
 On soft ice warmed by the sun, Garbrecht skated in 40.21 seconds to edge 
Schenk, the Olympic bronze medalist, who clocked 40.33. Blair finished at 
40.35, well off Saturday's time of 39.72.

competition. . . . Tommy Moe of Palmer, Alaska, notched his first World Cup

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; BO STAYS HOT WITH 400-FOOT HOME RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It couldn't be happening, but there it was, right before their very eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bo Jackson, brought to the Angels to be a part-time player and big-time gate 
attraction, suddenly is creating havoc with their plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson not only has earned a job on the Angels' opening-day roster with his 
spring-training performance, but he has forced the Angels to at least consider 
the prospect of putting him in the everyday lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson continued his magnificent spring Sunday by hitting a 400-foot homer 
over the right-field wall in the Angels' 18-5 loss to the Colorado Rockies. If 
Jackson keeps it up, Angel Manager Buck Rodgers may have no choice but to make 
him a regular. 
</P>
<P>
 "It still is going to be very difficult," Rodgers said, "but I sure wouldn't 
bet against him." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who started in left field Sunday, is batting .391 this spring with a 
.727 slugging percentage. He leads the team with two homers and 16 total bases, 
and is second with seven runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 While Jackson continues to thrive, his competition continues to struggle. 
Designated hitter Chili Davis, expected to return today after being sidelined 
because of a groin pull, is batting .133. And first baseman J.T. Snow is 
batting .192. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It may be spring training, but the Angels' pitching woes and nine-game losing 
streak have started to become a bit humbling. The Angel pitching staff yielded 
a spring-high 26 hits Sunday, including nine for extra bases. Its earned-run 
average soared to 9.85, worst in the Cactus League. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Farrell probably pitched himself out of the Angels' plans Sunday, 
yielding five hits and four earned runs in two innings, raising his ERA to 
15.63. "I'm certainly concerned about John Farrell," Rodgers said. "He can't 
have any more bad ones, that's for sure.". BOB NIGHTENGALE

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; NO ONE HESITATES TO SPEAK ON PARK'S STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether the hesitation in Chan Ho Park's pitching motion is permissible has 
yet to be decided, but veteran umpire Bruce Froemming said if it is not 
determined soon, "when we get to the regular season, it will be war." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodger pitcher hesitated rarely during his delivery Sunday against the 
Montreal Expos, but the few times he did, it was noticed. Afterward, Expo 
Manager Felipe Alou told Froemming that during the season he would not let Park 
pitch that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime you stop during your motion, it is an interruption or an alteration, 
and that is not allowed," Froemming said. "If a batter calls time out, I will 
give it to him, because that is how I interpret the rule. If he doesn't call 
time out, then the game goes on." 
</P>
<P>
 Park has a series of unorthodox deliveries that are more unique to an Asian 
style of pitching, but it is when he hesitates shortly after he begins his 
windup, either when he goes back or pivots to a flamingo-style position, that 
has Froemming asking for a rule interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Vargo, the league's director of umpires, attended Sunday's game to see 
Park, but left without comment. Reached later by telephone, he said the issue 
would probably go to the rules committee and get straightened out. "There's 
nothing in the rules that prevents it," Vargo said. "That was the first time I 
have seen him pitch and, personally, I don't think there's anything wrong with 
it, but I don't know everything. We will see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Froemming, who worked first base, is concerned that the rules committee will 
delay a decision, causing even more confusion.  
</P>
<P>
 Froemming said Alou did not have his batters call time out Sunday because 
Vargo had spoken to Alou before the game. "He told him the rule had not been 
interpreted yet, and that the game was going to be on television, so we don't 
want to make a fuss." 
</P>
<P>
 The batter Park used the move on most was Larry Walker, and it certainly 
didn't distract him -- he walked and homered.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Martinez started for the first time against the Dodgers and gave up one 
run and three hits in three rocky innings. "They have me working on something 
in my mechanics, but I can't tell you what it is, because then the competition 
will know," Martinez said. "It felt good coming to Dodgertown today. Here's 
where I grew up in baseball, so it's like coming back home. MARYANN HUDSON

CROLL'S OMISSION IS SMITH'S GAIN; HORSE RACING: LAST YEAR'S LEADING JOCKEY TOOK 
OVER ON HOLY BULL IN SEPTEMBER AFTER TRAINER FORGOT TO CHOOSE A RIDER FOR AN 
ALLOWANCE RACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The way jockeys sometimes end up on good horses can be more chance than 
design. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no better example than Laffit Pincay when trainer Woody Stephens was 
winning five consecutive Belmont Stakes in the 1980s. Pincay rode the first 
three -- Conquistador Cielo, Caveat and Swale -- in the streak, even though 
Eddie Maple was Stephens' regular stable rider at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Maple was either injured or picking the wrong Stephens horses to ride. Craig 
Perret can use the latter reason for not having ridden Holy Bull as a 
2-year-old, and now Mike Smith is riding the gray colt, who won Saturday's 
Florida Derby to become the early Kentucky Derby favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Perret passed on riding Holy Bull last year and Smith took over because 
Roberta Croll, wife of trainer Jimmy Croll, chose him to ride in an allowance 
race last September at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I forgot to name a jockey to ride the horse," Croll said Sunday. "I was in 
Kentucky for a (horse) sale when I called home and my wife said that the track 
had called asking about the jockey. 'They told me who was available, and I gave 
them Mike Smith,' she told me. I said, 'That's fine. Mike's a good jockey.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Good, to say the least. Two of Smith's record 62 stakes winners last year were 
aboard Holy Bull, and the 29-year-old jockey finished with $14 million in 
purses, leading the nation and winning an Eclipse Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Perret was Croll's first choice to ride Holy Bull. The jockey and the trainer 
both raced in New Jersey, and Perret has been the rider for some of Croll's 
best horses. In 1987, Perret rode Bet Twice, who was second in both the 
Kentucky Derby and the Preakness before winning the Belmont Stakes. In 1990-91, 
years when Croll's Housebuster won national sprinting titles, Perret was the 
colt's regular rider. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of weeks before Holy Bull's allowance race at Belmont, Perret asked 
Croll what kind of a horse Holy Bull was. "He's just average," said the 
trainer, whose opinion was based on Holy Bull's only start, a victory against 
maidens at Monmouth Park in mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
 Perret told Croll that he had a couple of other horses to ride in the same 
Belmont race that Holy Bull was going to run in. The one with the most 
potential was End Sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Roberta Croll, Mike Smith got the call and rode Holy Bull to a 
seven-length victory, the second victory in a five-race winning streak. End 
Sweep, with Perret, finished third, 10 lengths back. 
</P>
<P>
 Perret finished second Saturday with Ride The Rails, with Holy Bull winning 
the Florida Derby by 5 3/4 lengths, the second-largest margin in race history. 
Most of the 13 beaten horses at Gulfstream are not expected to try Holy Bull 
again when he makes his final pre-Kentucky Derby appearance in the Blue Grass 
at Keeneland on April 16. The Derby will be run three weeks later, with Smith 
seeking his first Derby winner. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Canaveral, unbeaten in two starts and unable to run in the Florida Derby 
because of an earnings rule, is entered against seven horses in an allowance 
race Wednesday at Gulfstream Park. . . . Fraise won the $300,000 Pan American 
Handicap by three-quarters of a length Sunday, giving Madeleine Paulson's 
6-year-old a victory in the Gulfstream stake for the second consecutive year. 
Summer Ensign finished second, a head in front of Fairy Garden, whose jockey, 
Jerry Bailey, claimed that Fraise and Mike Smith had crowded his mount at the 
top of the stretch. Fraise's victory, his 10th in 27 starts, increased his 
earnings to $2.4 million. Carrying high weight of 124 pounds, which was between 
nine and 12 pounds more than any other horse in the field, Fraise ran 1 1/2 
miles in 2:24 3/5. 
</P>
<P>
 As Indicated scored a 3 1/4-length victory over late-closing Federal Funds in 
the $100,000 Grey Lag Breeders' Cup Handicap at Aqueduct. Under Robbie Davis 
and with the high weight of 127 pounds, As Indicated dueled with Primitive Hall 
to the middle of the stretch before drawing away. He covered the 1 1/8 miles in 
1:46 1/5 over the fast inner dirt track. As Indicated returned $3.60, $3.20 and 
$2.40. Federal Funds, coupled with Jacksonport, paid $6.60 and $4.00, and 
Michelle Can Pass paid $3.20.

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; L.A. NOW VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So, now that Los Angeles' brief run as boxing's leading city has come, gone 
and produced a decent amount of cash, where does L.A. boxing go from here? 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympic Auditorium has reopened and is settling in for the long haul. The 
Forum still is churning out its own series of shows. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three weeks, both arenas put on huge, big-budget cards -- complete 
with million-dollar purses, three major titles in contention, the 
much-anticipated kickoff to Oscar De La Hoya's HBO headline career, and the 
highest ticket prices this area has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Forum's Feb. 19 show and the Olympic's March 5 show had prices that 
topped at $250 and bottomed in the $40-50 range -- Las Vegas casino fight 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The result? Lots of money and two major titles changed hands, and not as many 
tickets were sold as either operation had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 The conclusion? Los Angeles, no matter how big the show, cannot sustain Las 
Vegas-level prices -- but if the casinos won't ante up $1 million-plus 
guaranteed site fees, the Forum or the Olympic are not money-losing 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Feb. 19 card, which featured the Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez rematch 
against Michael Carbajal and the Rafael Ruelas-Freddie Pendleton lightweight 
title bout, the Forum, which holds 16,000 for boxing, drew a paid crowd of 
slightly less than 10,000 -- producing a live gate of more than $400,000. 
Factoring in the revenue from the Forum's Senate seats, the take was probably 
more than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 When De La Hoya won the World Boxing Organization junior-lightweight title 
over Jimmi Bredahl on March 5, the Olympic Auditorium, with a capacity of 
7,600, drew a paid crowd of slightly less than 3,000 -- producing a $294,000 
live gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, promoter Bob Arum is planning to bring both Gonzalez-Carbajal III and 
De La Hoya very soon to the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 The second Gonzalez-Carbajal rematch is tentatively set for late June, though 
there are several details to be worked out. De La Hoya's first, and probably 
only, WBO junior-lightweight title defense is scheduled for May 27 at the MGM 
against WBO No. 1 contender Giorgio Campanella, on a card that will include 
Ruelas' first International Boxing Federation lightweight defense and a title 
defense by IBF middleweight champion Roy Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arum, who is promoting the Olympic revival and co-promoted the 
Carbajal-Gonzalez bout with Forum Boxing, says he is not finished bringing 
elite-level boxing to Los Angeles. He just has to make some adjustments, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody can match Las Vegas," Arum said. "There's no city that really can. 
Ringside wasn't the problem, it was the other ticket prices. Ringside sold out, 
practically. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom and the middle bottom sold pretty good, too, but middle really 
died. But you learn. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to find the niche here, for ticket prices and everything. My 
inclination is, on my next big event, we go like about $150 ringside, not $250. 
That makes better pricing for the rest of the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Arum and the Olympic's owners, Steve and Dennis Needleman, hoped for a 
full house for the reopening, even with a significant number of complimentary 
tickets handed out, the total attendance was 5,843. Tickets for less important 
shows such as last Saturday's, featuring Zachary Padilla, were sold at prices 
ranging from $5 to $40. 
</P>
<P>
 Arum blamed himself for the low turnout March 5 -- for pricing the tickets so 
high for a fight that was broadcast live on HBO without a local blackout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering it was live television, I was quite pleased," Arum said. "I think 
with more moderate prices, we'll be fine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Busy, busy, busy: With the Olympic adding fights every other week into the 
mix, with the MGM Grand becoming the most active player in boxing, with a big 
heavyweight bout -- Evander Holyfield vs. Michael Moorer, April 22 at Caesars 
Palace -- on the horizon, the sport is extremely active, but not exactly 
booming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boxing is in a little lull right now," said Marc Ratner, executive secretary 
of the Nevada State Athletic Commission. "There are a lot of fights and people 
are going to pick and choose who they're going to spend their money on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to say we have big crowds here, well we had four title fights (March 
4 at the MGM Grand) and we didn't have 1,000 people paid. So that means it's 
still the attraction that sells the tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 In Las Vegas in the coming weeks those attractions include a bout Thursday at 
the MGM Grand when Terry Norris fights for the first time since his loss to 
Simon Brown. Then comes the real action: Caesars' Holyfield-Moorer bout will be 
quickly followed by Don King's huge four-rematch card May 7 at the MGM, 
featuring Julio Cesar Chavez vs. Frankie Randall, Norris vs. Brown, Gerald 
McClellan vs. Julian Jackson and Azumah Nelson vs. James Leija. That will be 
followed by the Jones-De La Hoya-Ruelas card in late May, followed by 
Carbajal-Gonzalez III. Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Julio Cesar Chavez, speaking to reporters last week for the first time since 
he suffered his first knockdown and lost a split-decision to Frankie Randall 
Jan. 29, said he now acknowledges that he did not win that fight -- despite his 
angry protests immediately after the decision was announced. "I've recognized 
that I lost the fight," Chavez said through an interpreter. "I feel the 
knockdown is what made the difference." Chavez, who readily admits he lost a 
degree of dedication going into the Randall fight, says the rematch May 7 will 
be entirely different. "I'll prove it to everybody May 7. And then I expect to 
fight (Pernell) Whitaker and prove that one wrong, too. Things will be 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, Chavez, 31, has begun contemplating an end to his career 
-- as long as he can do it on a high point. "What I'm looking at now is that I 
don't want to continue in boxing for too long," he said. "I want to continue 
for this year. I do promise that this year I have left in boxing I'm going to 
prepare myself well and train properly."  
</P>
<P>
 Though nothing has been signed, the leading candidate for Rafael Ruelas' first 
International Boxing Federation lightweight title defense May 27 is Carl 
Griffith. . . . Michael Carbajal is scheduled to fight for the first time since 
his loss to Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez in early April at Laughlin, Nev. . . . 
The latest agent-handler-attorney angling for a piece of the Oscar De La Hoya 
marketing pie? Leigh Steinberg, best known for his representation of NFL 
quarterbacks Troy Aikman, Warren Moon and Steve Young. Boxing Calendar

NORTHRIDGE HAS A GRAND TIME; COLLEGE BASEBALL: CSUN SWEEPS HAWAII IN THREE-GAME 
SERIES BEHIND HOWARD'S DRAMATIC EIGHTH-INNING SHOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 And they call Hawaii paradise? 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, home-sweet-homely Matador Field was a big slice of heaven for the Cal 
State Northridge baseball team, which pulled off its most stirring comeback of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 How wild was it? Northridge Coach Bill Kernen, not prone to superlatives, used 
"best" and "ever" to describe the crazy scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the best scene we've ever had around here," Kernen said, cracking a 
broad smile. "The fans, the dramatic stuff, it was something to see." 
</P>
<P>
 The scene stealer was Kevin Howard, whose grand slam capped a six-run rally in 
the eighth as Northridge shocked 24th-ranked Hawaii, 9-6, to complete a 
three-game sweep in a Western Athletic Conference series opener. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors (12-10, 3-0 in conference play) trailed, 6-3, entering the eighth 
and Hawaii right-hander Andrew McNally seemingly was cruising. With one out, 
though, Eric Gillespie singled and Chad Thornhill walked, prompting McNally's 
removal. 
</P>
<P>
 To that point, McNally, a sophomore from Australia, had given up eight hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth," Kernen said, "I was was pretty happy to see him outta 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard turned outta there into outta here. Mark Johnson, a 6-foot-3, 215-pound 
freshman, came in throwing plenty of fastballs, most of which whizzed back at 
him with equal velocity. Jason Shanahan greeted Johnson with a single to drive 
home Gillespie, paring the deficit to 6-4, and Keyaan Cook singled to load the 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
 With a rabid contingent of Northridge students taunting Johnson with sing-song 
verbal jabs, he nicked Josh Smaler with a pitch to force in a run, bringing the 
Matadors within 6-5. Howard, one for 11 in the series as he stepped in, tried 
to keep his wits about him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't get that excited -- that's not really my game plan," said Howard, a 
junior transfer from Fresno City College. "I just watch the game and kick 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 A moment later, the home dugout was kicking and screaming. Howard was late on 
a Johnson fastball, but the blast nonetheless easily cleared the wall in right 
and landed on the roof of a temporary classroom for a 9-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Howard's) a pretty clutch guy," Kernen said. "I'd rather have a guy with 10 
homers like that one than 20 when we didn't need 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 Smaler went bananas as he rounded the bases, which didn't endear him to the 
Hawaii players. Shortstop Sy Farinas, in fact, gave Smaler a one-finger salute. 
It wasn't the index finger. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard's slam, his third homer of the year, wasn't even the coup de grace in 
one of the wildest innings in Kernen's six-year tenure. On the following pitch, 
Johnson hit Tyler Nelson between the shoulder blades with a fastball to start 
more fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was ejected and both dugouts emptied. No contact was made, but play 
was delayed for several minutes while coaches and umpires redirected players 
back to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-hander Aaron D'Aoust (4-0) was the surprise starter for the Matadors. 
D'Aoust, who turned 21 Saturday, pitched the first complete game of his career. 
He gave up three earned runs and 13 hits and threw 130 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 3-2, Hawaii (14-11, 0-3) scored four in the sixth, which included a 
solo homer by Jody Napuunoa, who had four hits. D'Aoust also gave up a single, 
double and triple in the inning.  
</P>
<P>
 "All my fault," he said. "I wasn't hitting my spots." 
</P>
<P>
 The spotlight was stolen by Howard, though the Matadors didn't make many 
friends in the process. Northridge -- which plays at Hawaii on April 15-17 -- 
may have found an archrival. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be fun to see who they bring out and what they try to do," 
Smaler said. "I feed off that stuff. I think this team does too." Matador Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Would you throw this man a strike? Freshman designated hitter Eric Gillespie 
had two hits to raise his batting average to a team-high .389 and has had 
multiple hits in an otherworldly seven of his last eight games. . . . First 
baseman Jason Shanahan had two hits Sunday to extend his hitting streak to 10 
games, during which he has eight multiple-hit efforts and 19 runs batted in. 
Shanahan is batting .364. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Second baseman Keyaan Cook, batting in the cleanup spot during the series, 
went seven for 11. . . . The nine-game hitting streak of catcher Josh Smaler 
ended Sunday -- he was the only Northridge starter without a hit -- but he 
scored once and drove in a run. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Matador Coach Bill Kernen is one victory shy of 200 in his six-year career at 
Northridge. His teams are 199-105-3 and play nonconference games against the 
University of San Diego on Tuesday and Hartford on Wednesday before opening a 
three-game WAC series at Cal State Sacramento over the weekend. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii, the preseason favorite to win the WAC West Division title, entered the 
Northridge series with an earned-run average of 5.27 and exited with a mark of 
5.91. Northridge, which has won seven of eight, scored 33 runs in 24 innings. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Eight of nine Matador regulars drove in runs in Saturday's 14-4 victory. Six 
players did likewise Sunday. . . . Hawaii brought their bats too. The Rainbows 
banged out 37 hits, but stranded 29 runners. Second baseman Corey Ishigo was 
seven for 13 in the series and outfielder Franz Yuen was six for 12.

FISCHER 2ND IN NATIONAL MEET AT 7-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeremy Fischer of Camarillo High cleared 7 feet 2 inches in the high jump to 
place second in the National Scholastic Indoor track and field championships at 
the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, N.Y., on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Bishop of Murray County (Ga.)High won the event with a personal best and 
meet record of 7-4 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second year in a row that Fischer has been runner-up in the meet, 
although his jump was 3 1/4 inches higher than last season. 
</P>
<P>
 James Lincoln of Birmingham High, who defeated Fischer in last month's Sunkist 
Invitational at the Sports Arena, and Jim Romero of L.A. Baptist did not finish 
among the top six, clearing 6-6 and 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't complain about 7-2," Fischer said. "I just wish I could have cleared 
(7-3 on my third attempt). . . . I swear that was like a 7-5 jump. I thought I 
totally had it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer and Bishop each missed their first two attempts at 7-3. After Fischer 
nicked the bar off with his left heel on his third try, Bishop cleared the bar 
on his final attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 He then made 7-4 1/4 on his second try before missing three times at 7-5 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop's performance moves him to third on the all-time national high school 
indoor performer list, and Fischer is tied for seventh with six others. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, who set a Ventura County record of 7-3 in an outdoor meet this month, 
cleared 6-6 and 6-8 on his first attempts and 6-10 on his second. 
</P>
<P>
 He made 7-0 on his initial try before clearing 7-2 on his third. JOHN ORTEGA

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

FIRE ALSO SCARRED SOME WHOSE HOMES SURVIVED; AFTERMATH: ON LAGUNA'S BURNED-OUT 
STREETS, THOSE REMAINING STRUGGLE WITH LONELINESS, GUILTY FEELINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They live on streets where houses have vanished, children no longer play and a 
walk down the block is a heartbreaking journey. 
</P>
<P>
 In the four months since a capricious firestorm spared their homes while 
annihilating their neighborhoods, these surviving families have been trapped in 
a nightmare world with a warped and eerie landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 They feel sad, lonely and guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 And they apologize for complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, they are the lucky ones, a cold truth that slices through them when 
they see an old neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to look into their eyes and talk about their loss and what they're 
going through, especially when you know some of them are not coming back," said 
Danae Dybas, whose Mystic Hills home stands on a devastated street. "Knowing we 
made it through this, there's an almost overwhelming sense of guilt." 
</P>
<P>
 As former neighbors immerse themselves in rebuilding plans, residents who 
remained in areas ruined in the Oct. 27 wildfire that claimed 366 homes -- the 
worst disaster in Orange County since the flood of 1938 -- are trying to shake 
the despair that followed initial relief that their homes were left standing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some feel their lives will never be the same, even when their neighbors 
physically recover. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst part is, it's over for all of us," said Linda Altdorffer, whose 
Mystic Hills home suffered relatively minor damage. "Somehow it's just torn 
everybody's lives apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Heintz, a survivor from the heavily burned Canyon Acres community, put it 
another way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like your whole family got wiped out in some strange accident and you're 
still left," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The house that most exemplifies the pick-and-choose monster blaze is the 
stucco edifice built by To Cong Bui. Immediately after the fire, photographs of 
the lone tile-capped structure amid rows of utter devastation were played 
across the front pages of newspapers and on television. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent sunny afternoon, Bui and his wife, Doris Bui-Bender, sat on their 
concrete deck overlooking the baked hillside and talked with friends about the 
invisible scars that the blaze left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody assumes you're happy because you still have your house, but it's 
not that way," said Bui-Bender, adding that some people now treat her as if she 
has "a different God." 
</P>
<P>
 "To live here in this neighborhood . . ." she started, her voice trailing off 
to a heavy sigh and a shrug of the shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can still feel the pain here," added Danae Dybas, who had stopped to visit 
while she and her husband Jeff were walking their dogs. The Dybases say they 
mostly miss the delights of nature that once brightened their days -- the lush 
natural landscape, the deer on the hillside. 
</P>
<P>
 One deer perished in the fire, apparently trying to escape, they said, leaving 
a splash of blood on their driveway, a grim reminder of a horror-packed day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to scrub it off and it won't come off," Dybas said. "I still look at 
those drops in the driveway." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dybases say their home suffered $125,000 damage in the fire, a reality 
that barely elicits sympathy when others lost all but a slab of concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have proof of their loss," Dybas said. "I feel we have to prove 
ourselves all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 If the days are dreary for these survivors, the nights are no picnic either. 
</P>
<P>
 With the street lights gone, chimneys rise like tombstones in the dark, and 
the Dybases tote a flashlight when they venture onto the funereal landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an eerie stillness, especially at night," Dybas said. "There's nobody 
to run to if you have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Altdorffer, who used to stride daily down Skyline Drive and up Park 
Avenue, has halted that exercise altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "The walks are over," Altdorffer said. "I tried walking once and I can't do 
it. It's just too sad. You don't go outside anymore. You can't go outside and 
feel good about it when you see this devastation . . . and you've got to live 
in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking from the fortress that is her comfortable living room, Altdorffer 
recalled how her garden, deck and roof were burned in the blaze. "Minor," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fire had "a devastating effect" on her youngsters, especially a 
daughter who Altdorffer said has slept fitfully and had "panic attacks" since 
the fire. The playmates who once zipped merrily along Tahiti Avenue on bicycles 
have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (main) drawback was losing the friends, all the people who used to be 
here," Altdorffer said, adding that she now has fewer visitors. "People just 
don't come up the way they used to, just don't want to see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Altdorffer walks out onto her deck, which overlooks the gray hillside. 
She apologizes for not being "more positive." 
</P>
<P>
 In a valley below Mystic Hills, in the heavily burned Canyon Acres community, 
Mike Heintz sits in the wood and shingle home he has leased for seven years and 
speaks with a similar sadness. 
</P>
<P>
 With his ravaged neighborhood peering in from almost every window, Heintz 
balances a coffee cup on his knee and tries to explain how he feels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just about everything has changed now," he said, the sounds of a wind chime 
and a rooster filtering into the cozy living room. "It's such a tremendous 
heartbreak every time I look out the window or stop to think about it. I had a 
couple days last week that I felt almost happy, almost up to par." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the others whose homes endured, the 51-year-old jeweler is deeply 
sympathetic toward his burned-out neighbors, and said he understands why some 
of them felt "almost bitter" toward him after the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's something you really have to work your way through," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heintz agrees it has been tough to get friends to venture into his 
less-than-inviting community. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said, Canyon Acres Drive draws a stream of "looky-loos," 
sightseers who roll steadily through the stricken communities, sometimes with a 
video recorder pressed to the vehicle window. 
</P>
<P>
 "They look at you like you're in a zoo," Heintz said. "The weekends, you 
almost feel like it's a little cruel." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, however, the curious are expected to give way to work crews as a torrent 
of construction gets underway. 
</P>
<P>
 This, too, will test the nerves of the frazzled group who survived round one 
of this disaster. With sound buffers burned to the ground, a lone hammer can 
sound like a gunshot, Heintz said. And then there's the traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be real difficult just to get through the tangle of vehicles," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mystic Hills resident Lou Shannon, 75, said the construction phase will be 
like "living in a tract house while it's being built." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our existence will be more messed up than it is now, that's for sure," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mystic Hills Homeowners Assn. President David Horne said his group is aware of 
the problems facing these families and has created an "existing homes 
committee" to help them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't realize anywhere near the trouble they were having until they began 
telling us," he said. "It made us suddenly go, 'Holy Cow. We were thinking they 
were lucky.' 
</P>
<P>
 "In a sense they were, they didn't lose their things," he added. "But they 
have an additional burden to bear now. They're going to have to deal with 
construction traffic for the next year and a half." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is the rebuilding that signals promise for these neighborhoods. Some 
people are looking forward to it. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, Martin Pestana busied himself trimming a healthy hedge 
at his Coral Drive home. Across the street, the foliage is still black. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be glad to see them back and rebuilding," he said.

TAFT HIGH WINS STATE ACADEMIC DECATHLON TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A team of students from Taft High School of Woodland Hills claimed the mantle 
of California's best and brightest Sunday, winning the state Academic Decathlon 
for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taft team, representing the Los Angeles Unified School District, 
out-tested Los Angeles County rival West High School of Torrance, which 
finished second. Laguna Hills High School of Orange County was third. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, we shook Stockton," said Taft senior Daniel Berdichevsky, 17, who took 
the gold medal for the highest overall score in the 10-event contest, earning 
8,937 points out of a possible 10,000. "I feel exhilarated." 
</P>
<P>
 Taft's win earned the San Fernando Valley school its fourth state championship 
since the contest began 15 years ago. The nine-member team will represent 
California in the national competition next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was a welcome-back gift for Taft Coach Arthur Berchin, who left 
decathlon training four years ago after leading the 1989 Taft team to the 
national title and returned this past year. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also a boost for the beleaguered city school district, which fared 
poorly in state test scores released last week. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 70 Taft parents, friends and school district administrators cheered 
as team members raked in 12 gold, 11 silver and seven bronze medals for 
individual events. The school scored 48,974 points of a possible 60,000; West 
High had 46,278. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft team leader Daniel, along with teammate Andrew Salter, 17, had tallied 
the two highest scores at the city competition. They made their marks again at 
the state level with Daniel taking top honors and Andrew finishing second 
overall with 8,395. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 375 students representing 43 California regions joined in the battle 
of brains that began Friday at the University of the Pacific. The first day 
included written tests in math, fine arts, economics, science, literature and 
social studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers were back to work Saturday morning with contests in essay 
writing, prepared and impromptu speeches, as well as an interview with a panel 
of judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft was the favorite going into the competition because of its win last year 
and the team's record-setting scores in the district competition. But team 
members said they were worried about the South Bay team from West High. 
</P>
<P>
 After a demoralizing first day, with students complaining that the tests 
seemed unusually difficult, some Taft team members feared that the scales were 
tipped in favor of their rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 A first-place tie with West in Saturday's Super Quiz, a public event held 
game-show style, increased the stress level among the members of both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sunday's awards banquet, Taft students nervously twittered at the table. 
Team members Sage Vaughn, 16, and Sheldon Peregrino, 18, created sculptures out 
of their water glasses and lunch remnants. Rebecca Rissman, 17, parked her 
elbows on the table and wrung her hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is torture," said Sage, who earned six medals. 
</P>
<P>
 But once Daniel and Andrew were awarded their high-scoring medals, the Taft 
team slowly began standing up, one by one, waiting for their moment to 
celebrate along with their video camera-toting parents. 
</P>
<P>
 And when it came, the announcement could hardly be heard over the cheers of 
Taft supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're so proud," said Jill Shapiro, whose 16-year-old daughter, Kimberly, 
earned three medals for the team. "They're all great. We love them all." 
</P>
<P>
 West High Coach George Floratos said he was proud of his students even though 
he was disappointed by the school's 0-4 record in the state competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of these times we're going to win it," Floratos said. "But Taft was a 
super team and a neat bunch of kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Other schools were not as upset by their finish. Bret Harte High School, 
representing Calavaras County after being the only county school interested in 
the contest, finished last. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do this all on our own -- we have no organized class or anything," said 
Bret Harte Coach Duane Oneto. "My purpose is to expose a bunch of hill kids to 
what it's really like when you go big time. And I think we achieve admirably on 
that point." 
</P>
<P>
 For Taft team members, who will compete at the Academic Decathlon's national 
competition in Newark, N. J., next month, the victory means only a short break 
from their grind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we get a few days off before we start studying again," Kimberly said. 
"We only have a month left." 
</P>
<P>
 Also competing for Taft was: Chris Huie, 17, who won eight medals; Michael 
Michrowski, 17, who won four medals; Stephen Shaw, 16, and the team's only 
junior, who won five medals.

UCI LECTURER, MENTOR OUT 'TO CHANGE SOCIETY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officially, Daniel C. Tsang is listed as a UC Irvine lecturer and as 
bibliographer at its massive main library.  
</P>
<P>
 But the university guide doesn't mention Tsang's controversial politics, his 
alternative radio talk show on campus, or his role as friend and confidant to 
Asian American students on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, he's a mentor," said Julie Chaicharee, 23, a senior political science 
student. "If I need to know more about the Asian community, I go to him because 
he talks to me. He doesn't talk at me." 
</P>
<P>
 His newest project, a one-hour radio talk show on KUCI, the student radio 
station, is billed as an "alternative view of what's behind the Orange 
Curtain." Guests and subjects have included supporters of gay teen-agers at 
Fountain Valley High School, decriminalizing prostitution, and gang hysteria in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a call-in format," Tsang, 44, said. "I'm asking critical questions of 
my guests, and people get to call in." 
</P>
<P>
 The program doesn't attempt balance. "I don't do the other side," Tsang said. 
"All my shows are like that." After all, he said, the 4 p.m. Tuesday show is 
titled "Subversity." 
</P>
<P>
 Tsang also is adviser to RicePaper, an alternative quarterly produced by Asian 
American students, and he has published numerous articles with a militant bite. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a student during the radical '60s and took an active part in anti-war 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, he joined anti-war marches on Washington and in New York state. He 
met Jane Fonda, former presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy, and U.S. Sen. 
Charles E. Goodell, a New York Republican opposed to the war who was appointed 
to the Senate to replace slain Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was 19 at the time," Tsang recalled. "I remember marching around, holding 
placards with the names of dead Vietnamese soldiers with a candle in another 
hand and we shouted out the names of dead Vietnamese. As an Asian, I didn't 
especially see why we should be bombing these people in their own country." 
</P>
<P>
 The year 1969 also was pivotal for personal reasons for Tsang, who is gay. It 
was the year of the Stonewall riot in Greenwich Village between police and

 Born in Hong Kong, Tsang attended British schools. His mother, a library 
assistant, and his father, a physician, moved the family to the United States 
when Tsang was 17. 
</P>
<P>
 His goal, he said simply, is "to change society." 
</P>
<P>
 He has published articles against the police practice of taking pictures of 
suspected Asian gang members, and has received death threats because of it, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was scary," Tsang said. "I got a death threat after I wrote that piece for 
the (Los Angeles Times opinion section) and a vicious anti-Asian letter saying 
I was probably a faggot. One Anglo guy whose wife is Vietnamese said they hated 
me because I was Chinese and someone called my phone and said I deserved to be 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
 While many of his friends have moved to San Francisco, Tsang said, he "stayed 
in Orange County because I believe this is like pioneer territory. . . . I'm an 
outsider and I see things differently from the general public." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of that belief, Tsang last year helped found a new countywide Asian 
American civil rights organization called AWARE, Alliance Working for Asian 
Rights and Empowerment. 
</P>
<P>
 On campus, where students call him Dan, his classes include the Politics of 
Sexuality and Asian-Pacific American Alternative Media, involve a healthy 
exchange of ideas between lecturer and student. 
</P>
<P>
 Lilly Chow, 20, a senior in Women's Studies and Comparative Literature, said: 
"I think Dan is very young at heart and people can sense that about him. We 
have only a few Asian Americans here teaching on the faculty. Dan isn't a 
professor and I think he comes across as less intimidating and more 
approachable." 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Chaicharee said Tsang's alternative media course was illuminating. Tsang 
assigned her research on Vincent Chin, a young Chinese American draftsman who 
was chased in the street by two unemployed Detroit Anglo auto workers and 
beaten to death in 1982. The attackers had mistaken Chin for Japanese and 
blamed him for their joblessness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never heard about the Vincent Chin story before Dan assigned it," 
Chaicharee said. Profile:

MUSLIM HOLY MONTH CLOSES; RELIGION: ABOUT 6,000 WORSHIPERS MARK END OF RAMADAN 
WITH PRAYER AND FESTIVAL OF FAST BREAKING AT MILE SQUARE PARK. BUT THEIR JOY IS 
OFFSET BY AGONY OF MUSLIMS IN BOSNIA. 
</P>

<P>
 More than 6,000 Muslims celebrated the conclusion of the holy month of Ramadan 
at Fountain Valley's Mile Square Park on Sunday by giving thanks and condemning 
aggression and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene was repeated throughout Southern California at mosques and in other 
places where the region's 1 million Muslims gathered to mark Eid ul-Fitr, the 
festival of fast breaking. "It's important because after 30 days of fasting, 
all the Muslims are together and everyone's excited and we exchange gifts and 
we wear new clothes," said Aamir Farukhi, 10, of Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is one of the best days," Aamir said. "Out of all the Islamic 
holidays, I like this one best. I wish it was a national holiday."  
</P>
<P>
 Although it is not a national holiday, it was clearly an international 
celebration as Muslims of all races and countless nationalities were 
represented at the prayer service on a beautiful, warm Sunday morning.  
</P>
<P>
 For 30 days during the holy month, Muslims fasted from dawn to dusk, striving 
"to achieve a higher degree of self-discipline, piety and inner peace," said 
Shabbir Mansuri, director of the Council on Islamic Education.  
</P>
<P>
 "The basic message is that the community should be together (observing) the 
values that Islam teaches, family values," said Muzammil Siddiqi, religious 
director of the Islamic Society of Orange County in Garden Grove, who led the 
throng in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our biggest holiday in the religion of Islam," he said, while people 
were still arriving for the second of two services. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the thousands who filed into Mile Square Park were still lined up 
along Euclid Avenue in their cars when the first prayer service began at 8:30 
a.m. Siddiqi led the gathering in the second prayer about half an hour later, 
to accommodate the latecomers.  
</P>
<P>
 Many men wore caps to cover their heads and kurtas (knee-length, collarless 
shirts), while many women were attired in ornate head scarves and flowing 
traditional dresses. Still others came in slacks and business suits. 
</P>
<P>
 At the conclusion of the prayers, the thousands rose from their prayer rugs 
and embraced one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a very physical people," Mansuri said. "We hug each other all the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the largest gatherings I've seen," Mansuri said. "It's a 
family gathering; especially for the children, it's very, very important." 
</P>
<P>
 Children are trained beginning at age 6 or 7 by fasting for half a day. But by 
puberty, fasting from dawn to dusk during Ramadan is mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Siddiqi was pleased with the number of young people at the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are living in the land of freedom," Siddiqi said. "But that should not 
make us free from the values of our religion. During the month, we have had a 
lot of young people (participating in services). They are coming in very large 
numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 But Siddiqi said the joy of the occasion was offset by the deaths and agony 
among Muslims from the ongoing violence in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot imagine a crime greater than this kind of crime," Siddiqi said, as 
event organizers collected donations for Bosnian relief missions. "We have 
prayed for the people who suffered." 
</P>
<P>
 Mufid Sokolovich, president of the American Bosnia Herzegovina Assn., Bosnia 
Relief Fund Inc., was among Sunday's worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although we are experiencing the unbelievable aggression in Bosnia, it is 
great to celebrate this day," said Sokolovich, who added that he is optimistic 
for peace in his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life in Sarajevo is easier," he said. "They can go to the mosques to 
celebrate the Eid, not like last year or the year before."

AIDS MEETING WILL EXAMINE EPIDEMIC; HEALTH: PARTICIPANTS WILL LOOK AT DYNAMICS 
OF THE DISEASE, WHICH ARE CHANGING IN THE COUNTY. TREATMENTS, TESTING OF 
PREGNANT WOMEN WILL ALSO BE ADDRESSED.

 When the Orange County HIV/AIDS conference convenes today, speakers will 
confront the changing face of the AIDS epidemic in Orange County, where the 
disease, once largely confined to white gay men, is cropping up among Latinos, 
blacks and heterosexuals, and among women and children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have HIV disease, and we are still hearing reports of newly infected 
people," said Penny Weismuller, who is in charge of the county's AIDS programs, 
adding that she doesn't think the disease has reached its peak here. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Health Care Agency -- which is sponsoring the two-day 
Seventh Annual HIV/AIDS on the Frontline conference -- reports that as of 
December, 1993, 3,091 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome have been 
recorded in the county. The number of new cases identified annually here has 
grown sharply since the first cases were reported in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 When the county passed the threshold of 2,000 cumulative AIDS cases in 1992, 
it qualified for the first time for special federal funding that is providing 
close to $2 million for medical and social services for those with HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, 789 new AIDS cases were reported in Orange County, a 72% increase 
over the 458 cases reported in 1992. However, county officials credit the huge 
increase last year to a much broader definition of AIDS adopted nationally that 
catches the disease in earlier stages. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the latest year for which such data is available, HIV infection was 
the leading cause of death in persons 25 to 44 years of age in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS remains far more concentrated among white men in Orange County than in 
the rest of the nation, with whites representing 75% of cumulative AIDS cases 
in 1993, compared to about 50% nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Laguna Beach had a higher rate of AIDS than any other U.S city; San 
Francisco was second. 
</P>
<P>
 But the distribution of AIDS in the county is gradually changing. 
</P>
<P>
 The proportion of whites with AIDS has declined from 86% of cases before 1988 
to 65% of the cases reported in 1993, while Latinos have increased from 10% of 
AIDS cases before 1988, to 21% of new cases in 1992, to 26% in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Weismuller said Latino men are passing the AIDS virus to women in part because 
of bisexual and extramarital sexual activity. Also, county figures show that 
more Latino men than white men acquire AIDS from drug injections. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS rates have increased most rapidly, however, among black men and women, 
who represented 6% of AIDS cases reported in 1993, up from 3% in 1991. The 
spread of AIDS among African Americans in the county mirrors what is happening 
nationally, county officials report. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While men having sex with other men is still the most prevalent form of AIDS 
transmission in Orange County, intravenous drug use is becoming an important 
factor. It accounted for only 3% of AIDS cases reported before 1988, but 13% of 
cases reported in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS has gradually begun to infect the county's women. 
</P>
<P>
 The county found female AIDS cases rose from 6% of all those reported in 1991 
to 6.6% in 1992, to 8.2% in 1993. But that is lower than nationally, where 12% 
of AIDS cases are women. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Beverly Sansone, director of the gynecological clinic for HIV-infected 
women at UCI Medical Center, said she had doubted AIDS was a significant 
problem among women in Orange County until two years ago, when she began to get 
referrals from the UCI women's clinic. She was asked to treat their 
AIDS-related gynecological problems.  
</P>
<P>
 "It opened my eyes," said Sansone, who in 1993 treated 65 female patients 
newly diagnosed with AIDS.  
</P>
<P>
 Sansone, who will speak at the conference at the Red Lion Inn, said her 
mission is to increase awareness among the public and the county's physicians 
about the importance of testing for HIV in women, especially those who have 
chronic yeast and herpes infections, which may be symptomatic of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Another topic expected to be discussed at the conference is the importance of 
testing for HIV in pregnant women, especially in the wake of reports that 
showed giving AZT to pregnant women may protect fetuses from contracting HIV. 
So far, 21 cases of AIDS in children have been reported in Orange County; 13 of 
the children got the disease from infected mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology has recommended that all 
pregnant women be tested," said Sansone, noting that routine HIV testing of 
pregnant women has been instituted at UCI's obstetrical clinics within the past 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Developments in the treatment of HIV-infected patients also will be discussed 
at the conference, said Dr. Jody Meador, the county's AIDS medical director. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think over the last several years we have made significant gains in keeping 
patients healthy longer primarily by medications that prevent complications and 
by the use of antivirals like AZT, DDI and DDC," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conferences like the one in Orange County, Meador said, are attended by 
physicians trying to keep up with fast-evolving treatment strategies. Among 
those issues are choosing the right time to start administering antiviral drugs 
and deciding whether such drugs should be given alone or in combination, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference, which addresses topics ranging from HIV in adolescents to 
death and the grieving process, is also expected to attract educators, 
paramedics, hospital administrators and social workers, as well as people 
infected with HIV.  
</P>
<P>
 The public may register at the door. The fee is $120 for both days or $75 for 
one day. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past seven years, county organizers said, the conference has expanded 
from a gathering of 200 local participants to a much more sophisticated 
scientific event, which this year is expected to attract 800 people, including 
international AIDS experts. AIDS in Orange County 
</P>
<P>
 The number of new AIDS cases reported in Orange County each year has increased 
rapidly since the first case was identified in 1981. The increase from 1990 to 
1991 is due, in part, to a more intensive surveillance effort undertaken to 
qualify for special AIDS funding. The slight decrease between 1991 and 1992 
represents return to a less intensive reporting program. The 72% increase in 
1993 is due mainly to an expansion of the definition of AIDS. Using the 1992 
definition, just 269 cases (34%) would have been recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 1981: 0 
</P>
<P>
 1993: 789 
</P>
<P>
 Ethnic Trends 
</P>
<P>
 During the past five years, the percentage of whites among new AIDS cases has 
been shrinking. At the same time, the number of Latino cases has almost 
doubled. Precent of new AIDS cases: 06,06,07,08,07,07,15 Year White Latino

STREET SMART: WALL ALONG PCH WON'T BLOCK SERENE VIEW OF THE OCEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 The problem which I would ask you to address may not qualify as an issue of 
traffic, but it does affect quality of life on the highway.  
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Coast Highway south of Corona del Mar, on the way to Laguna Beach, 
offers several wonderful lengthy views of our beautiful Pacific Ocean. It's 
quite a welcome change from the rest of the coast nearby where one must either 
own a million-dollar house or pay the $6 parking fee to be able to enjoy a few 
moments of serenity offered by a sight of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, Pacific Coast Highway is being widened and "improved" as a condition 
of the Irvine Co.'s development on the inland side of the highway. Irvine Co. 
had promised not to alter any of the natural terrain on the ocean side of the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 Why then, is there a WALL being built on that side, which will completely 
ERASE forever the view of the ocean from any car traveling on that road?  
</P>
<P>
 The insensitivity of those in positions to influence the quality of life of 
the masses continues abated. 
</P>
<P>
 Syd Clopton 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
 The wall you see being built now will not block the view from the highway, 
promises Rose Orem, a spokeswoman for Caltrans, because the project also calls 
for the highway to be realigned and elevated to the height of the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, two retaining walls are being built along the ocean side of Pacific 
Coast Highway, both to support existing hills, Orem said. One wall will run 
along a bike trail to support an embankment, and that will not be seen at all 
from the highway, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other wall -- the one you see now under construction near Reef Point 
parking lot -- will support another hill facing Pacific Coast Highway, Orem 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Both walls and the elevated highway are expected to be finished by December, 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Some time ago someone wrote about people driving cars in the bike lanes in 
Irvine. In many places the lanes are wide enough to allow cars to pass to the 
right of traffic slowing or stopping at an intersection. The article also 
contained a response from the Irvine Police Department stating that they watch 
for this and would not allow people to turn the bike lanes into their personal 
car lane.  
</P>
<P>
 I drive Red Hill Avenue south from Alton Parkway every workday and see dozens 
of drivers use the bike/pedestrian lane for as much as a block as they approach 
Main Street. The city of Irvine could collect a lot of fines if the police 
watched only this one spot around rush hour. I have never seen anyone stopped 
for this violation at this location or any of the many other locations around 
Irvine where this practice goes on regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedestrians have to walk in these lanes at this location and others because of 
a lack of sidewalks and I have seen cars force pedestrians out of the lane by 
creeping along on their heels. I have also seen and experienced drivers getting 
testy at a bicyclist who is using the lane and slowing their progress. I 
experienced this because I sometimes ride my bike to work. 
</P>
<P>
 I urge the Irvine Police Department to clamp down on drivers illegally using 
the bike/pedestrian lanes. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Drivers who flaunt the bicycle lane law should be thankful they're not pulling 
that stunt in Davis, the small college town west of Sacramento where the 
bicyclist reigns supreme. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Davis, motorists would be shot, drawn and quartered if they dared use a 
bicycle lane," said Bill Madison, spokesman for the California Department of 
Motor Vehicles in Sacramento. "Davis is such a bicycle haven, especially near 
campus, but the law is the same anywhere in the state. Vehicles should stay out 
of bicycle lanes." 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Sam Allevato of the Irvine Police Department said drivers cutting into the 
bicycle lane do pose a threat to bicyclists, but an even bigger problem has 
surfaced. In recent months, police have responded to calls where drivers 
illegally using the bike lane have rear-ended drivers who were legally using 
the bike lane to make turns, he said. Last month, two such crashes were 
reported.  
</P>
<P>
 Let's review the law.  
</P>
<P>
 Vehicles are permitted in a bike lane to make a right turn only where the 
solid white line gives way to a broken line about 200 feet before an 
intersection. Drivers still must heed any bicyclists in the lane, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Vehicle Code adds that drivers can use the bicycle lane to park 
where parking is permitted and to enter or leave the roadway.  
</P>
<P>
 Allevato said the police department welcomes phone calls from the public 
alerting them to unsafe conditions such as drivers bike lanes. On the strength 
of your letter, more police will watch for that on Redhill Avenue near Main 
Street, he said.

STREET SMART: RIGHT TURN ON RED IS OK THANKS TO WORK OF GARDENER

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 The intersection of Doris Avenue and Ventura Road in Oxnard presents a 
confusing condition that I am sure you can clear up for me. 
</P>
<P>
 There are signs posted forbidding motorists on northbound Ventura Road from 
making right turns on red onto Doris. It is not clear, however, whether these 
signs are also intended for Doris Avenue traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it permissible for the westbound right-lane traffic to make a right turn on 
a red light onto Ventura Road? 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Amador, Oxnard 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 In a word, yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorists are allowed to turn right on red from westbound Doris Avenue onto 
Ventura Road, Oxnard Traffic Engineer Joe Genovese says. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, that turn was not allowed because large bushes made it 
difficult for motorists to see oncoming traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bushes have been hacked below the visibility line, and right turns on 
red are now permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm concerned about the safety of motorists at the intersection of California 
Street and the Ventura Freeway in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers going north across the Ventura Freeway overpass have to wait a very 
long time to get through the intersection because cars coming off the freeway 
block the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually if you block an intersection, you are subject to a citation. 
</P>
<P>
 Since drivers clog this intersection so often, could the city install "do not 
block intersection" signs near the off-ramp and on the pavement? 
</P>
<P>
 Also, when cars coming off the freeway aren't blocking the intersection, 
they're turning left at a high rate of speed, endangering those trying to drive 
across the overpass. 
</P>
<P>
 These are ongoing problems. Can anything be done about them? 
</P>
<P>

 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The clogging that occurs at the Ventura Freeway's California Street off-ramp 
is inherent to the design of the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Placing "do not block intersection" signs along the roadway would not do any 
good because motorists coming off the freeway don't have anywhere else to go, 
Ventura Traffic Engineer Nazir Lalani says. 
</P>
<P>
 As for trying to control speeding, the city has posted warning signs along the 
off-ramp asking motorists to slow down, and that's about all they can do, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not really the sort of place where you can put speed bumps," Lalani 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 But all is not lost. 
</P>
<P>
 A complete, $10-million reworking of the intersection is on the city's list of 
long-term projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The new design includes a plan to separate ramp traffic from motorists 
crossing the overpass, helping traffic move along more smoothly. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 There's a speeding problem in my neighborhood that's gotten out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 I live in Oak Park at the corner of Conifer Street and Smoketree Avenue. In 
the last four months, speeding drivers turning from Conifer onto Smoketree have 
hit a tree, lawn planter, utility pole and, finally, a column helping to 
support my house. 
</P>
<P>
 There are stop signs on Smoketree, but they don't do any good in slowing down 
cars that come screeching down Conifer. 
</P>
<P>
 I know it's unusual for a stop sign to be installed on such a small street, so 
my wife and I have collected 75 signatures of neighbors who would like to see 
stop signs on Conifer. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there any chance that the county would agree to install these stop signs? 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Hamilton, Oak Park 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Stop signs on Conifer may be possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on your request, county traffic workers are studying the intersection to 
figure out whether it would qualify for stop signs under state standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at the overall traffic situation," said Butch Britt, the 
county's deputy public works director. "We can't install regulations for a few 
unsafe drivers. We need to look at the best way to handle the normal traffic 
flow." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Britt cautions that stop signs are not intended to slow traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Putting in a stop sign isn't going to stop the speeders," Britt said.

WHERE NAVY FAMILIES ARE AT EASE, OFF BASE; CAMARILLO: MILITARY PERSONNEL FROM 
PORT HUENEME AND POINT MUGU GET A TASTE OF CLOISTERED SUBURBIA IN A UNIQUE 
HOUSING COMPLEX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They come from U. S. Navy bases and ships scattered all over the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 They stay for maybe three years and then go -- packing up their families, 
their sea bags and the few precious belongings they own. 
</P>
<P>
 But while stationed in Ventura County, Navy personnel and their families who 
are assigned shelter in a unique housing complex in Camarillo also get a slice 
of middle-class civilian life in suburbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchored on the western side of Camarillo, just a few blocks off the Ventura 
Freeway and seven miles from the nearest base, Catalina Heights is home to 
about 1,100 Navy personnel from the Construction Battalion Center at Port 
Hueneme and the Point Mugu Naval Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Civilian visitors driving into the compound sense that something about the 
place is different. But they often don't know that they have driven onto an 
extension of a Navy base. 
</P>
<P>
 On most of the streets, large signs remind drivers that children are at play 
and to slow down accordingly. Block after block, the standard-issue beige, 
brown and off-white color scheme covers rows of single-family homes and 
two-story townhouse apartments -- some in noticeably better shape than others. 
</P>
<P>
 At nearly every corner, children with their mothers in tow play on the many 
grassy areas that stripe the nine-block, 315-unit complex. 
</P>
<P>
 At the community center, run by the Navy's Morale, Welfare and Recreation 
Division, a petty officer with time on his hands borrowed a communal mower and 
a pair of garden shears from the center to cut his slightly overgrown lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 And, although it is not a federal holiday, vibrant American flags fly nearly 
everywhere one looks. Beside them, handmade signs welcoming home long-missed 
sailors hang in doorways, porches and carports. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, under a lazy afternoon sun, spouses chatted about the many things Navy 
families have in common -- such as the loneliness brought on by the absence of 
a husband or wife and the nagging fear that the next time a loved one walks out 
the door might be the last time he or she is ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents suspect that the sharing of concerns that has created an extended 
family here can't be found in any civilian neighborhood nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "If my neighbor hears a suspicious sound or her car breaks down, she knows 
that she can feel free to call us," said Perry Merritt, wife of Lt. Clark 
Merritt, a test squadron maintenance officer at Point Mugu. "And that same kind 
of thing works for me when Clark's away. It's a nice feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 This support network, neighborhood residents say, is why they stay pretty much 
to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that we don't like the folks living outside; it's just that people 
who are not in the Navy have a hard time understanding what our spouses go 
through when we're gone," said Frank Petruzzi, 35, a petty officer and aircraft 
mechanic at Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 Petruzzi, his wife, Leatha, also 35, and their three boys, ages 9, 11 and 14, 
like living in their Camarillo house after living on base for much of his 13 
1/2-year career. They have lived at Catalina Heights for almost three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "For security reasons, I liked living on base, but a lot of people who live on 
base never feel like they leave work," Leatha Petruzzi said. "Being out here 
gives Frank a nice break from work." 
</P>
<P>
 The housing compound was acquired by the Navy in 1975 after the Air Force 
closed what was then Oxnard Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the closure, the base was turned over to the county, which 
renamed it Camarillo Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The housing facility, originally named Capehart, now serves as a critical link 
in the Navy's housing network in Ventura County, said Capt. Tom Boothe, a 
public works officer who oversees Navy housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Boothe said that currently, Navy personnel must endure up to 18-month waiting 
lists for Navy-subsidized housing. Personnel not lucky enough to secure the 
rent-free digs are given a housing allowance to get a place to live outside 
Navy facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Boothe said, the Navy completed the first phase of renovation on 
Catalina Heights interiors, including the installation of new plumbing, 
hardwood floors, new kitchens and appliances. He said that this year, the Navy 
would focus on renovating the exteriors, community center and playground areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy, which will spend $1.9 million on renovation at Catalina Heights this 
year, will make nearly 400 new on-base housing units available at Port Hueneme 
and Point Mugu by the end of April to meet demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quality-of-life factor is something we are very concerned about," Boothe 
said. "We want people to take pride in where they live. We want them to have a 
sense of ownership of the unit they're occupying." 
</P>
<P>
 At Catalina Heights, residents say they enjoy the nearly self-contained 
environment -- replete with a community center and military version of a 
convenience store. Their trash is picked up by the Navy, as is the cost of 
their utilities. The county provides police and fire services. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the nice things about housing here is that once you're here, you have 
everything you need," said Marge Hays, wife of Seabee Petty Officer Brooks 
Hays. "The Navy runs the community center and a mini-mart. Even though you have 
all the advantages of the civilian world around you, everything's right here." 
</P>
<P>
 At the community center, residents can receive free preschool and day-care 
services for their children. Currently under renovation, the center, which sits 
in the middle of a park inside the neighborhood, serves about 70 children a 
day, according to Yvette Collins, the facility's director. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins said one of the center's missions is to support Navy families, many of 
whom become de facto one-parent families when spouses are away at sea. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not uncommon to have one spouse at sea and one spouse working full 
time," Collins said. "Those are the kinds of situations where we come in. We 
make sure that the kid is where he or she should be and that everything's OK. 
We provide a level of security for the working parent that they can depend 
upon." 
</P>
<P>
 But being part of a Navy family means that separation from a loved one is a 
hard fact of life, Leatha Petruzzi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You start by being honest with your kids," she said. "You tell them that 
while their daddy or mommy is gone, they're going to have to handle more 
responsibility. Basically, you get them involved. If you do that, the pain of 
the absence doesn't hurt quite as much."

SCHOOLS WORK TO IMPROVE SCORES ON STATE TEST; EDUCATION: INSTRUCTORS ARE USING 
SAMPLES TO FAMILIARIZE PUPILS WITH THE UNUSUAL FORMAT OF THE CALIFORNIA 
LEARNING ASSESSMENT SYSTEM EXAM, WHICH COVERS READING, WRITING AND MATH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than a week after the release of new statewide assessment test results, 
many educators in west Ventura County are taking steps to boost their school's 
scores in the next go-round. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't have much time. 
</P>
<P>
 The next California Learning Assessment System tests will be given to fourth-, 
eighth- and 10th-grade students across the state in the last week of April and 
in early May. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare students for the tests, some school officials said their main task 
is convincing those teachers who remain critical of the new testing system of 
the exam's importance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the secret is we've got to get teachers to understand the importance 
of the scores," said Bill Studt, superintendent of the Oxnard Union High School 
District, which had the lowest reading scores in the county in the CLAS results 
released last week. 
</P>
<P>
 At some schools, teachers don't need any convincing. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrillo Middle School teachers in Ventura have already begun using sample 
tests in their classrooms to help students become familiar with the unusual 
format of the CLAS exam, which assesses students in reading, writing and math. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike previous statewide assessments that consisted solely of multiple-choice 
questions, CLAS asks students to write their responses to pieces of literature 
and to explain how they arrived at solutions to math problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to match what's being taught in the classroom with what is being 
tested not only in content, but in format," said Kris Bergstrom, principal of 
Cabrillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrillo students had the lowest scores on the CLAS writing test of any of the 
Ventura Unified School District's four middle schools. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials expressed surprise that the writing scores at the 
relatively affluent middle school were below those of DeAnza Middle School, 
whose students come from the mostly poor Ventura Avenue neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 44% of Cabrillo's eighth-graders last year demonstrated an ability to 
write in a coherent, organized manner, compared with 48% of DeAnza's 
eighth-grade class. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, officials noted, DeAnza began aggressively adopting new 
academic programs to boost student performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us were really, really pleased," DeAnza Principal Dave Myers said. 
"One of the things that DeAnza has had for a number of years is real strong 
emphasis on instructional practices." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergstrom said she is confident that Cabrillo's scores will improve as the 
school continues its shift to new, state-mandated curriculum that teaches 
skills tested by CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrillo officials also plan to send letters to parents telling them the dates 
of the next CLAS tests and asking them to ensure that their children come to 
school well-rested and mentally prepared for the grueling exams, Bergstrom 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although DeAnza officials were generally pleased with their students' scores 
on CLAS, they are also enlisting parents' help in boosting future test scores. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's Parent-Teacher Assn. will hold a forum later this month to 
explain how parents can help their children master the writing and 
problem-solving emphasized on CLAS tests. "Parents are used to working (with 
their children) in a situation where there's a right or wrong answer," Myers 
said. But CLAS puts less emphasis on students' getting the right answer than on 
their explaining how they arrived at that solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fundamentally different than it was before," he said. Children "are 
going to be coming home with different activities than sitting down with 25 
long-division problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Like DeAnza, officials at Ventura High School were mostly pleased by the CLAS 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura High students performed better in reading and about the same in math 
compared with their peers at Buena High School, despite a view among some 
residents that Ventura High is academically inferior to its cross-town rival. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's that myth out there that has been attached to the image of Ventura 
High School," Principal Jerry Barshay said. "The CLAS tests show that the 
academic scores for reading, writing and math for Ventura High School are equal 
to or better than our neighboring schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Barshay hopes that new academic programs begun at the school this year, 
including an after-school tutoring program, will help improve the school's 
scores on the next CLAS tests. 
</P>
<P>
 In some districts, educators are first trying to decide whether they trust the 
scores from the last CLAS tests before they make changes to improve future 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
 In Camarillo's Pleasant Valley Elementary School District, officials were 
surprised to see that their fourth-grade students scored below the county 
average in reading, while their eighth-graders were well above the county 
average in the same subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Shirley Carpenter said she wants to examine the fourth-grade reading 
scores in comparison to the students' results on other standardized exams 
before she draws any conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pleasant Valley school trustee Jan McDonald said she thinks that the 
scores send a clear message: "It tells us that something's not right and 
there's something we need to fix. It's going to take some time to find out 
what's gone wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 But, she added, "we're going to find out."

CITY CLERK IS VIEWED BY HER CO-WORKERS AS 'ANSWER LADY'; VENTURA: BARBARA KAM 
WINS PRAISE FOR CALM EFFICIENCY AND EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE. BUT CRITICS SAY SHE IS 
LAX IN ENFORCING ELECTION LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 When City Clerk Barbara Kam started work at Ventura City Hall more than 32 
years ago, the city had a population of nearly 26,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buenaventura Mall didn't exist, nor did the Santa Paula Freeway. Few 
houses could be found east of Mills Road, and there were barely 100 employees 
on the city payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 As the city's chief record keeper, Kam has seen Ventura's evolution by way of 
the annexation papers, development agreements and other documents that have 
crossed her desk during the three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing really changes except the names and places," said Kam, 55. "We have 
grown, but Ventura has not lost its charm." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of her long tenure at City Hall -- Kam has the third-longest service 
record with the city -- she is regarded by her co-workers as a walking 
database. 
</P>
<P>
 "She remembers all kinds of things," said City Manager John Baker, who began 
his tenure with the city 12 years ago. "Most of the stuff flows across her desk 
in some fashion. She's very efficient and she knows what she's doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Police Capt. Randy Adams, a friend of Kam's for more than 20 years, 
also praised her knowledge of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always viewed her as the 'Answer Lady,' " Adams said. "If you had a 
question about anything in the city, she would have the answer and some 
historical perspective on it besides." 
</P>
<P>
 Her two staffers say Kam is easy to work for: She gives hugs and kisses every 
day, but runs a well-organized and efficient division at the same time. With a 
base salary of $63,432, she is viewed as one of the city's top officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Kam's office handles a range of responsibilities: keeping the agenda for the 
City Council, administering special event permits, maintaining contracts, 
posting public notices and conducting city elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll never, ever, hear her raise her voice," said Deputy City Clerk Diane 
Angle, who has worked with Kam for three years. "But when you screw up, she'll 
let you know it." 
</P>
<P>
 Angle said Kam's chief philosophy is customer service. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents frequently come into the city clerk's office to complain about city 
services, get information about council meetings and request council meeting 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of marvel how she handles the public," Angle said. "By the time they 
come in here, they're ruffled and they want to pound on the counter. She never 
gets ruffled." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Baker praises her as a stellar employee, critics say Kam's office is 
lax in enforcing election law. They say Kam does not lean hard enough on people 
who don't file their campaign expenditure reports on time and does not check 
the accuracy of expenditure reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Kam, a soft-spoken woman who describes her managing style as "mother hen," 
works hard at keeping warm relationships with her workers, who say she 
remembers birthdays and anniversaries, and sometimes buys them presents for no 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "If your people are happy, they'll produce," Kam said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city clerk's job requires being city historian as well, Kam said. 
</P>
<P>
 She has compiled data on old city cemetery records for genealogy enthusiasts, 
tracked down council-related trivia for reporters, and is putting together a 
list of all city-owned property and related documents so the city has a record 
of its land assets. 
</P>
<P>
 She has also created the electronic indexing system for city records and is 
working on establishing an electronic document system. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're creating records not for today, but for tomorrow," Kam said. "It's not 
for us; it's for the poor bloke behind us." 
</P>
<P>
 Kam said her long-term ambition is to get all city records on computer so that 
they can be retrieved quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dream is to stop pushing this stuff," Kam said, gesturing at mounds of 
paper neatly stacked in piles on her desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Computers have made her job much easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never imagined computers," Kam said. "When I came here, we were still 
working on clunky old typewriters and papers with six carbons." 
</P>
<P>
 Kam, who was raised on a ranch in the San Joaquin Valley, moved to Ventura in 
July, 1961, when she married her first husband, Frank Thomas, a car salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 She began working at Ventura City Hall as a switchboard operator the following 
month. Six months later, she was promoted to a clerical position in the city 
manager's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, Kam became deputy city clerk, a position she held for about 
nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 After a reorganization in June, 1971, Kam was named city clerk. That year, she 
married George Kam, a retired airplane technician whom she met after Thomas 
died of a heart attack in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kam never obtained a high school diploma, she said the business 
administration courses she took in school helped her, along with on-the-job 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have any interest in what you're doing, you'll learn everything you 
can about it," she said. "I'm good at what I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Kam said she has picked up knowledge over the years relating to election 
guidelines, zoning and legal issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically, city clerks act as a little hub for people," Kam said. "We will 
get you to the right person." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say Kam is not aggressive enough about enforcing state laws relating 
to City Council campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Patagonia spokesman Paul Tebbel, whose company has been involved in several 
City Council elections, said of Kam: "She thinks it's her obligation to request 
that people adhere to the law. It is my opinion that her job should be to 
police the activities of people involved in the elections." 
</P>
<P>
 In last fall's City Council race, with only two weeks left before election 
day, thrift store magnate Ray Ellison had reported spending about $6,000 in 
advertising -- a report that Tebbel disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 "My impression was that he was near double that," Tebbel said. "He did tons of 
full-page ads." 
</P>
<P>
 Tebbel told Kam of his suspicions, and she said she called Ellison about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Kam said Ellison told her that he shops around for low newspaper advertisement 
rates and that "(Tebbel) can think whatever he wants. He doesn't do a very good 
job of shopping rates." 
</P>
<P>
 Kam said Ellison complied with all the election laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not my job to read every newspaper in the county and see what kinds of 
ads are in them," she said. "A lot of this is on the honor system." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Clerk Richard Dean, who oversees countywide elections, agreed 
with Kam. 
</P>
<P>
 "By law, she's not required to verify anything," Dean said. "How could we, 
unless we hired a team of private investigators and auditors?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kam is dedicated to her job, she emphasized that her life does not 
revolve around City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to have other things in your life to make it whole," said Kam, who 
enjoys gardening at her house on the hillside above Ventura High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Her other hobbies include making porcelain dolls, collecting trains, sewing 
her own clothes and painting wood crafts projects. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she has a collection of 40 dolls and eight train sets. Every Thursday 
evening, she joins three friends in a painting group. 
</P>
<P>
 Her friends and co-workers tease Kam about her long auburn hair, which is 
always swept up in a coiffure nearly half a foot tall. Kam, who sits with her 
back to the camera at City Council meetings, said residents usually don't know 
what her face looks like, but frequently recognize her by the back of her head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen it down," Toni Taylor, executive assistant to the city 
manager, said of Kam's hair. "A lot of people wonder how long her hair is." 
</P>
<P>
 Kam said her hair reaches to her knees. At one time, in 1972, it almost 
touched the floor. Her employees have been threatening to give her a permanent 
wave for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband said his wife rarely loses her temper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't argue with her," said George Kam, 59. "She doesn't get mad, she gets 
even." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Kam said that getting angry never helps a situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the heat of things, you can never resolve anything," she said. "If you can 
wait for things to settle down, you can win." 
</P>
<P>
 This philosophy has also been carried over into her professional life, Kam 
said. At City Hall, co-workers say she is well-known for her tranquil nature. 
</P>

FUND-RAISER ATTRACTS PLEASED BUT SMALL CROWD; BENEFIT: VISITORS TO FRONTIER DAY 
ARE GREETED BY ENTERTAINMENT, FOOD AND HANDMADE JEWELRY AT EVENT FOR NATIVE 
AMERICAN FOUNDATION. 
</P>

 Charlie Chaplin went home sick; John Wayne didn't even bother to show up. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Dr. Zacharia, a traveling tonic salesman, and Western singer Gypsy Bell 
were left to woo the sparse crowd -- except for the Groat Brothers, who teamed 
up with Wyatt Earp for a mildly entertaining gunfight. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the thin attendance and a downtrodden promoter, Frontier Day at 
the Stagecoach Inn Museum in Thousand Oaks on Sunday pleased those who paid $3 
each to benefit the California Indian Council Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bit of history," said Deborah Ketcham, who attended Frontier Day with 
her husband, Chuck, and their 9-year-old son, Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives you a flair for what the Conejo used to be like and the West in 
general," the Thousand Oaks mother said. "It's interesting looking at the 
stagecoaches, but I wouldn't want to ride in one. It looks like it would be a 
rough ride." 
</P>
<P>
 The president of the Thousand Oaks-based nonprofit group that hosted the 
fund-raiser tried to make the best of the lukewarm support the event received 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here to have a good time, and we're going to have one," said Richard 
Angulo, a Yaqui and Chumash who said his group benefits Native Americans with 
scholarships, food and other items they may need. 
</P>
<P>
 The event sought to bring to life the early days of this century, when 
characters such as Chaplin and cowboys and marshals such as the ones Wayne 
played in Hollywood movies roamed the prairies that once crossed the Conejo 
Valley and the rest of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 But so few people turned out for the fund-raiser that the council president 
said he might even lose money on the event. The foundation will now have to 
come up with other ways to make ends meet, Angulo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to do something because this turned out not as big as I thought it 
would be," said Angulo, who said he advertised the fund-raiser on the radio and 
in local newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if we can break even and the people have fun, then it's all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who did attend Frontier Day were greeted with nearly a dozen 
entertainers and period actors dressed like cowpokes and dance hall girls, and 
Wyatt Earp presiding over mock trials. An impromptu jail housed those who 
failed to abide by the rules of frontier justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum tours, a barbecue and sale of handmade Indian arts and crafts from 
Chippewa's Leather Goods also kept those who showed up interested. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the programs we do here are living history," said John Gorham, a 
docent with the Stagecoach Inn Museum. "When we add the dimension of the actual 
actors, it seems to bring it more to life." 
</P>
<P>
 At the leather goods stand, Bob Schenk, a buckskin-clad member of the Groat 
Brothers Wild West Show of Simi Valley, was selling bone-and-bead chokers, 
animal skins and $25 bags of natural pheasant feathers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sell a lot of those because the Indians use them in their headdresses," 
Schenk said of the bags of feathers. "There's no plastic in any of these," he 
added, looking over the $95 chokers. "They're all handmade."

PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR TAKES CARE OF BASICS; SIMI VALLEY: RONALD C. COONS 
OVERSEES ROAD AND UTILITY SERVICES. BUT SOMETIMES HE AND THE CITY COUNCIL 
DISAGREE OVER USE OF FUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A smooth stretch of road, a tall glass of tap water, a forcefully flushing 
toilet -- daily facts of life that most people take for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Ronald C. Coons. 
</P>
<P>
 As Simi Valley's director of public works, Coons spends his days planning road 
improvements, testing water and monitoring the sanitation plant to ensure safe, 
efficient delivery of the city's basic services. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city of 102,000, providing those services is a big job. Coons, 47, 
oversees nine divisions, managing nearly half of the city's 530 employees and 
more than two-thirds of its $85.7-million annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cities were formed to provide basic services," Coons said. "It's our job to 
provide those services as economically and efficiently as possible for the 
health and safety of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest ongoing challenge for the public works director, according to 
Mayor Greg Stratton, is to make sure that the city's money is well spent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing we want is to see three guys standing around a hole while 
another guy digs," Stratton said. "I think Ron's done a pretty good job in 
making sure that doesn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Every so often, however, Coons and the City Council disagree about appropriate 
use of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 One year, Stratton recalled, Coons asked the city to buy a van to shuttle 
public works employees to meetings at City Hall. The council rejected the 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, the request for the van was back. "He called it something else, 
like utility-touring vehicle," Stratton said. "But . . . we asked him all these 
questions and he finally admitted that it was the same old van." 
</P>
<P>
 The council had a good laugh and nixed the request. "He never did get that 
van, but we still tease him about it," Stratton said. "Every year when we look 
at his budget, we say, 'So Ron, where's the van?' It's become sort of a 
tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 A soft-spoken, methodical man, Coons takes the ribbing in stride, spending 
long hours plotting the city's public works future. 
</P>
<P>
 His next big task is a whopping $1.2-million road-paving project, to repair 
roads throughout the city that were damaged in the heavy rains of recent years. 
The city usually spends about $1 million a year maintaining its roads. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a major effort," Coons said of the project. "We're gearing up now." 
</P>
<P>
 When not at work, Coons volunteers with the city's Rotary Club and spends time 
with his seven children, who range in age from 23 months to 24 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Before work each day, he slips out for an early morning walk through the 
streets of Simi Valley with his wife, Sally. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives us a little time alone," he said. It also gives Coons a chance to 
monitor streets and sidewalks for cracks and bumps that might need tending. 
</P>
<P>
 Strolling along the streets, Coons could point to dozens of projects that bear 
his touch: a housing tract here, a widened road there. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Coons has shepherded projects that have profoundly changed the 
face of Simi Valley: development of the Indian Hills housing tract, extension 
of Tapo Canyon Road from Cochran Street to Royal Avenue, and construction of 
the interchange at Madera Road and the Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are great projects that really improved the city," Coons said. "They 
are a real asset to the area." 
</P>
<P>
 There are many other, less visible projects in Coons' charge. Among them are 
the city's new sewage treatment plant and its 37 water tanks and 400 miles of 
underground pipeline that carry water to more than two-thirds of the city's 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those lines ruptured during the Jan. 17 earthquake, throwing Coons 
into the biggest public works crisis of his 17-year career with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Coons and his staff worked around the clock to repair broken lines and restore 
service. He dispatched his building inspectors to examine toppled chimneys and 
collapsed walls. To date, more than 9,000 structures have been scrutinized for 
earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a huge challenge," Coons said. "But I think we were prepared and 
really pulled through." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Lin Koester agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were tough times for the city, and I think Ron and all the staff did an 
excellent job," Koester said. "Ron really knows how to get people to work 
together. He's a superior manager." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Coons' staff describe him as an exacting but sympathetic boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants your best performance, and he's also very open to suggestions for 
improvement," traffic engineer Bill Golubics said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes my job so satisfying," Coons said, "is having sought out the best 
people I could find to fill the department -- from top to bottom." Profile of

NEIGHBORHOOD FINDS THAT IT'S TAKING CONTROL; THOUSAND OAKS: LAS CASITAS SHOWS 
SIGNS OF PROGRESS IN ANTI-CRIME AND OTHER EFFORTS, WHICH WILL BE DETAILED IN A 
COUNCIL REPORT TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeffrey Bock knows that his neighborhood's improving because of everything he 
doesn't see. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't see police constantly responding to emergency calls. He doesn't see 
cars lining both sides of every street. He doesn't see two-bedroom apartments 
housing a dozen-plus people. 
</P>
<P>
 And he doesn't see the pervasive apathy that once kept life a dismal status 
quo in Las Casitas, a neighborhood of 540 condominiums in western Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really taking control of the neighborhood, one step at a time," Bock 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally proud of the neighborhood's progress, Mayor Elois Zeanah on Tuesday 
will present the City Council with a report detailing half a dozen programs 
that have turned Las Casitas into a local success story. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole feel of the neighborhood is different now," she said. "I'm really 
impressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most impressive statistics: the quarterly crime analysis, which 
shows a reduction in calls for police help. 
</P>
<P>
 With its high-density design and lower-income residents, the complex has long 
staggered under an unsavory reputation, pegged as a dangerous and unkempt 
neighborhood even by its residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and residents agree that Las Casitas still has some problems. A few 
condos remain crowded. A few parties spiral out of control. And a few vending 
trucks with blaring horns still cruise the streets, waking babies from naps and 
disturbing the twilight tranquility. 
</P>
<P>
 But there appears to be less crime in Las Casitas. The Sheriff's Department 
has not compared the latest calls-for-service report with that of the prior 
winter, but Sgt. Harold Humphries said he thinks that the crime rate has 
continued to fall. Sgt. Bruce Hansen, who patrols the neighborhood regularly, 
estimates that crime in Las Casitas has dropped by nearly 30% over the last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Hemeon, who moved to the neighborhood 17 years ago, agreed. "The whole 
place has changed," she said. "The people in it have mellowed out. I'm sure we 
all have more pride in our neighborhood now." 
</P>
<P>
 While Las Casitas still generates more than 80 calls to police each month, 
many of the calls involve loud parties or ear-splitting music, not violent 
crime or bloody fights. 
</P>
<P>
 "The area is definitely on its way to becoming more in synch with the rest of 
Thousand Oaks," Humphries said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the council will have a chance to make Las Casitas even safer. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will vote on an agreement with the Ventura County Flood Control 
District to install wrought-iron fencing along the perimeter of a concrete 
channel in the neighborhood, to keep out transients and teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 If it blocks people from clambering into the concrete culvert, the fence 
should cut down on noise and graffiti in Las Casitas, while keeping children 
out of a dangerous play site, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That fence is extremely important because it keeps foot traffic in the area 
down," Bock agreed. "At one point, we had people living there, setting fire to 
the eucalyptus trees, throwing parties. . . . You name it, it was down there." 
</P>
<P>
 The council has already pledged $97,200 toward the cost of the fence, a sum to 
be matched by Las Casitas' homeowners association. The action Tuesday will 
simply ratify an agreement with the flood control district, which has agreed to 
kick in $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Tuesday, council members will hear appraisals of two recently implemented 
programs to improve Las Casitas' ambience. 
</P>
<P>
 An ordinance limiting overnight parking has thinned out the gridlock look of 
Las Casitas' seven streets, which until recently were lined bumper-to-bumper 
with cars. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last month alone, sheriff's deputies have nabbed 120 violators, 
according to the mayor's report. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliminating the clutter of cars that once choked Las Casitas' streets will 
prove especially important when city officials launch a long-planned effort to 
turn renters into owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Absentee landlords own about 60% of Las Casitas' condominiums, and many of 
them have indicated interest in selling -- especially since the sagging real 
estate market has sent property values plummeting. Townhomes once worth upward 
of $120,000 are now listed for less than $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage tenants to buy condominiums -- and, presumably, care for them 
better than the absentee landlords -- the city has offered a low-interest down 
payment assistance program, with no money due for six years. Officials have 
also lobbied hard to get long-term federal loans for the low-income renters. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the city's Redevelopment Agency has purchased one condominium in Las 
Casitas, and officials are working to spruce it up with new appliances, clean 
carpets and a fresh coat of paint. They're also looking for a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a 100% turn-around in that neighborhood," said Sheila Frye, a 
consultant designing the city's Ownership Assistance Program. "My feeling is, 
let's go for it."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FOCUS OF RESOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supervisors Vicky Howard and Maggie Kildee will ask their board colleagues 
Tuesday to adopt a resolution urging the federal government to pay for services 
it requires Ventura County to provide to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard and Kildee complain that the federal government is forcing local 
governments to provide a host of costly services for illegal immigrants but 
fails to provide enough money to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members have discussed the mandates with federal officials on several 
occasions, including during a trip to Washington last year and among colleagues 
at the recent National Assn. of Counties conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution urges the federal government to "recognize its obligation to 
reimburse state and local governments for the costs of providing federally 
mandated services to illegal immigrants by appropriating sufficient federal 
funding to cover these costs." 
</P>
<P>
 In his state budget proposal now under review, Gov. Pete Wilson included a 
request for $3 billion in federal funds to pay for health, education and public 
assistance services that the state must provide to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Clinton Administration budget proposal did not include that 
appropriation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Supervisors passed a similar resolution a year 
ago. JEFF McDONALD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; HIGHER AMBULANCE FEES CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fire Department, which took over ambulance service in November to save the 
city money, is now thinking about seeking higher fees for emergency service. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Kaump, the department's ambulance service coordinator, said rates have 
not been raised since 1990 and are lower than those charged by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 3 in August to create the city-run program, ending a 
contract begun in the 1960s with Seal's Ambulance Service. 
</P>
<P>
 It was estimated that the Fire Deprtment ambulance program would cost $549,975 
in its first year. 
</P>
<P>
 The department is considering asking the council to approve unspecified higher 
fees within the next few months, Kaump said. The department hasn't yet 
submitted a proposal outlining why a fee increase would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 As an alternative to fee for service, the city offers an insurance program 
that provides free service to those who subscribe. The insurance, called the 
FireMed Insurance Program, costs an individual $3 per month to subscribe. The 
city collects more than $700,000 from the FireMed program. The fees for that 
program would remain the same, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 75% of the people who call for ambulance service do not belong to the 
FireMed program. Those people pay $190 for basic ambulance service, though 
county rates have now risen to $225, he said. The city also charges $8 per mile 
for service, and there is a surcharge of $30 for service between 7 p.m. and 7 
a.m. Those fees are about 30% lower than the county's, Kaump said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just looking at providing an option to council to raise the rates," 
Kaump said. 
</P>
<P>
 When it took over the service, the council voted to buy three new ambulances, 
communications equipment and hire 18 drivers. Fire Chief Michael Dolder 
presented the change as a way to close a $470,000 budget gap for the Fire 
Department. He said a city service -- which would piggyback on Fire Department 
facilities for dispatching -- would help save lives too. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, council members Linda Moulton-Patterson and Jim Silva voted 
against the proposal, saying they would prefer to see competition among 
ambulance services. Councilman David Sullivan also opposed the program, saying 
he feared costs would escalate. WILLSON CUMMER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: 3 YOUTHS TAKE TOP HONORS AT ART SHOW 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three Ventura County children have been honored as winners of a regional art 
show sponsored by the Boys & Girls Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Shull of Ojai, and Crystal Jack and Leonardo Martinez, both of 
Ventura, earned first place last week in their respective age groups in the 
sculpture category. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian won in the 9 and under category for his sculpture titled "Here's 
Looking at You, Ducky," said Pat Borison, a club spokeswoman. Crystal came out 
on top in the 10-12 age group for her "Fancy Flower" sculpture, and Leonardo 
placed first in the 13-15 division for his work titled "Breakfast a la 
Leonardo." 
</P>
<P>
 Their work will be among 36 entries to be sent on to the Boys & Girls Club 
national headquarters in Atlanta for a national competition next month. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 700 pieces of art by Boys & Girls Club members from nine Western 
states were submitted for the exhibit. Judging took place Wednesday at the Boys 
& Girls Club on Johnson Drive in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners' sculptures, plus works submitted by members of Boys & Girls clubs 
in Camarillo, Oxnard, Simi Valley, Moorpark and Ventura, will be included in an 
exhibit set to start this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit will be open Thursday to March 27 from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. at 
Ventura Harbor Village, 1583 Spinnaker Drive. Boys & Girls Club officials hold 
the competition each year to encourage members to develop artistic talents, 
Borison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local clubs conduct year-round art classes, crafts demonstrations and special 
arts activities, she said. KAY SAILLANT

 The Ventura County Crime Stoppers Program is offering up to $1,000 for 
information leading to the arrest of thieves who stole air bags and stereos 
from BMWs in a Thousand Oaks auto dealer's lot last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The cars were parked at the Rusnak BMW dealership when thieves smashed the 
windows of 11 cars between Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, police 
said.Five of the cars belonged to customers who had dropped them off for 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The thieves removed air bag assemblies from the steering wheels of eight cars 
and took the Alpine or Pioneer stereos from 10. The loss totaled $26,000, 
police said. 
</P>

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; COLLEGE'S EQUINE PROGRAM WILL END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Moorpark College program that trains students how to work with horses will 
graduate its last 25 students this summer as the college shuts down the program 
and funnels the savings to more basic classes, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The about $150,000 it costs annually to pay two employees and feed and stable 
60 horses at a ranch in Newbury Park will instead go to add classes, said Jim 
Walker, president of Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a small program, and we've been cutting classes to save money," he said. 
"Something has to give." 
</P>
<P>
 Since its inception more than a decade ago, the program has been run by 
college instructor Donald Anderson. Part of the reason that the college is 
ending the program is because Anderson is retiring in May, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students spend a year taking such courses as horse husbandry, principles of 
horse ranch management and artificial insemination of horses. At the end of two 
semesters, they receive an equine management and training certificate and can 
look for jobs at a horse ranch, animal entertainment center or in other 
equine-related industries. 
</P>
<P>
 The college had stabled the horses for free on 200 acres in Newbury Park owned 
by the National Park Service. CONSTANCE SOMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; DISTRICT PLANS POLICY ON SEX HARASSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cypress School District next month plans to adopt a policy that would 
allow expulsion of any student who sexually harasses another student or 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the policy, students may face expulsion for making graphic sexual 
comments about other students, telling sexual jokes or stories, touching 
classmates or their clothes in a sexual manner, spreading sexual rumors, 
displaying sexually suggestive objects or retaliating against students who 
report policy violators. 
</P>
<P>
 Unwelcome sexual flirtations or propositions also would be prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, if a sexual relationship between a student and a teacher or other 
district employee is reported, the district would conduct an investigation. 
Should such a relationship be found to exist, the student may face expulsion, 
while the employee may face termination. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said they will consider the policy to provide "a learning 
environment that is free of sexually discriminatory intimidation." MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; AILING MAYOR SAYS HE'LL SEEK REELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite growing community concern over his health, Mayor Gene Beyer said he is 
fine and not only intends to remain in office but also will seek reelection in 
November. "I still planning on running, and I'm fine," said Beyer last week. 
"I've got bad knees and (a bad) shoulder, but my heart is fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyer's comments follow an editorial in a local newspaper that urged him not 
to seek reelection and another statement by the head of a local taxpayers group 
who implied at last week's council meeting that the mayor might not be able to 
complete his term. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Bennyhoff, the managing editor of Orange's Common Talk, called on Beyer in 
a recent editorial to drop his plans to run again for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the time has come for Beyer to devote his remaining energy to the 
battle against the medical problems which continue to beset him," wrote 
Bennyhoff, a longtime supporter of the mayor. "We believe the time has come for 
Beyer to seriously consider making his present term his last as mayor." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of three recent falls -- two of which occurred leaving the council 
chambers -- Beyer, 66, missed four of five council meetings in February and 
half a dozen in January and December. During council meetings, the mayor often 
receives help from colleagues when standing up or sitting down. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyer, who underwent quadruple bypass heart surgery after his heart stopped 
two years ago, had new defibrillators installed last month. A defibrillator is 
a battery-powered electronic device that senses life-threatening heart rhythms 
and shocks the heart into resuming a normal beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Carole Walters, head of the Orange Taxpayers Assn., read a position statement 
before the council saying the group would like to have a special election to 
fill a vacancy rather than someone being appointed to the council. Walters said 
the statement was read because the group fears Beyer may not finish his term. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mayor, recognizing the statement was aimed at him, said he isn't 
stepping down. "I have no intention of resigning," Beyer said after Walters 
read the statement. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; VOLUNTARY SCHOOL UNIFORM PLAN OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fountain Valley School District Board of Trustees last week gave their 
formal support to schools interested in starting a voluntary uniform program. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees unanimously adopted a policy that gives schools guidelines if 
uniforms are to be an option for student dress. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have our blessing if they want to do it -- now they can do it without 
any opposition from the board," said trustee Larry R. Crandall. 
</P>
<P>
 Final adoption of the policy is expected at the March 24 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the policy, to establish an optional uniform system, a school must 
circulate a survey soliciting the views of parents and also provide options for 
the types of uniforms permitted. A uniform option would be allowed only if a 
majority of parents favor it. A committee at each school would determine the 
type of uniforms children would wear. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Robert Sedlak said he supports uniforms because "it creates a 
positive identity for kids and their school and it improves kids' attitudes in 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 Students at Roch Courreges Elementary School may be the first to start wearing 
uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Patty Berger, co-president of the PTA at Courreges, said a uniform program is 
planned for the school this fall. In a survey last month, 197 of the 273 
parents who responded supported wearing uniforms, said Susan Henry, PTA 
co-president. 
</P>
<P>
 Uniforms promote school spirit, improve learning and make it more economical 
for parents when it comes to buying school clothes, Henry said, adding that the 
parent group is now "gathering information" about the types of school uniform 
clothing available and their costs.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; INTERIM FIRE CHIEF GETS PERMANENT POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a year and two months as the city's acting fire chief, William R. 
Simpkins has been named to the Fire Department's top post permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I can focus on what I need to do here as chief," said Simpkins, 48. 
</P>
<P>
 In his view, the chief task is to make the department more "user-friendly." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's four fire stations have long been known in the community as the 
places where firefighters hole up and don't come out unless an emergency 
occurs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important for the firefighters to get out and have a public 
presence so the public will learn about fire prevention, protection and 
solutions to hazardous problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials praised Simpkins' ideas and appointed him to the job last 
month. An official badge-pinning ceremony will take place Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpkins, a longtime resident of Yorba Linda, was hired as Brea's fire marshal 
in 1989 and has worked as acting chief and fire marshal since 1992, when former 
Fire Chief Bud Moody retired. 
</P>
<P>
 He took over both jobs when the city instituted a hiring freeze to trim the 
budget. The city lifted the hiring freeze recently for the sole purpose of 
hiring Simpkins. 
</P>
<P>
 His annual salary will be $97,000. He will supervise 56 employees, including 
48 sworn firefighters, and oversee a $5-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Before coming to Brea in 1989, Simpkins worked for the Orange Fire Department, 
beginning his firefighting career in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they chose Simpkins based on his performance over the past 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Simpkins' direction, the department coordinated evacuations, 
investigations and rescues at the scene of a fatal plane crash in Carbon 
Canyon; contributed to battling the firestorms in Laguna Beach, Malibu and 
Anaheim Hills; and assisted firefighters in Northridge after the 6.8-magnitude 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpkins performed in an outstanding manner and proved that he is the right 
person for the job, assistant City Manager Tim O'Donnell said. MIMI KO

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: WARM TEMPERATURES EXPECTED TO DISSIPATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The unseasonably warm temperatures that drove thousands of Ventura County 
residents to the beach Sunday are expected to dissipate by this morning, 
leaving the county with clear skies and daytime temperatures ranging from the 
mid- to high 70s, weather forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a pretty good-sized crowd out today; it was easily our busiest day 
since last Labor Day," said Lifeguard Craig Sap, who works at San Buenaventura 
State Beach."I think it was a mixture of cabin fever and the temperatures that 
drove people out here." 
</P>
<P>
 Sap said that despite the large crowds, lifeguards at Ventura State Beach had 
few major rescues due to water temperatures hovering in the high 50s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another five degrees warmer and we would have had some problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fueled by a strong Santa Ana condition, highs in the county Sunday reached 
near 90 degrees in Camarillo, with the temperatures only slightly cooler in 
Oxnard and Ventura, according to Bruce Thoren, a meteorologist with WeatherData 
Inc., which provides forecasts to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Thoren said wind gusts bordered on 30 m.p.h. in some areas of the county. 
Overnight low temperatures are expected to fall to the mid-50s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Santa Anas you got were a lot stronger than we originally thought," he 
said. "That's why you saw those temperatures. That's pretty unusual for this 
time of year." 
</P>
<P>
 Thoren said the cooling trend is expected to chauffeur in a weak Gulf of 
Alaska-bred rain storm beginning Wednesday afternoon. J. E. MITCHELL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH / CORONA DEL MAR; OPINIONS SOUGHT ABOUT 
TOLLBOOTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state attorney general's office is soliciting the opinions of city 
officials and residents about plans to place a tollbooth on a portion of 
Newport Coast Drive where it will become a part of the San Joaquin 
Transportation Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter last month to Newport Beach Mayor Clarence J. Turner, state Atty. 
Gen. Dan Lungren said his office would collect input from all interested 
parties by Friday, when it will issue an opinion.  
</P>
<P>
 At stake is the placement of a tollbooth at the point where Newport Coast 
Drive meets the future path of the San Joaquin Transportation Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Coast Drive follows a loop around the city of Newport Beach, 
connecting MacArthur Boulevard near the Corona del Mar Freeway to East Coast 
Highway near Crystal Cove State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The portion of Newport Coast Drive that is proposed to become a tollway 
extends from MacArthur Boulevard to about a mile east of Bonita Canyon Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Corona del Mar fear that charging a toll will encourage motorists 
to detour through their quiet, seaside community along East Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 This month's Corona del Mar Chamber of Commerce newsletter encourages members 
to protest the toll plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without this free public road (Newport Coast Drive), Pacific Coast Highway 
and our flower-named streets will again be impacted with commuter traffic from 
South County," the newsletter says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have challenged the legality of placing a toll on what is now a public 
roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Joaquin Transportation Corridor Agency has maintained that the toll 
has always been a part of the corridor's plans and is necessary to produce 
revenue to pay back the $1.1 billion in bonds that were sold to finance the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Newport Beach has drafted a letter to Lungren that supports 
proposals to build a toll-free alternative parallel to the tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 That letter is expected to be approved at tonight's public meeting at City 
Hall. The meeting starts at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Those wishing to register their views should contact state deputy Atty. Gen. 
Clayton Roche, 455 Golden Gate Ave., Suite 6200, San Francisco, CA 94102-3658.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PROBATION DEPT. VOLUNTEERS SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barbara Jackson, who donates her time to work for the county, has a pretty 
unusual job as a volunteer with the Probation Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, she visits the homes of people sentenced to house arrest 
and places and removes the high-tech electronic monitoring equipment that 
ensures they are not wandering from their residences. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, a Buena Park resident, also makes unannounced visits on behalf of the 
county's work-furlough program, which allows offenders to continue working 
while serving sentences in a non-traditional jail facility in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I make sure they are complying with the rules and court orders," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, 41, began the work about a year ago and is among the first group of 
volunteers who completed the Probation Department's 40-hour training program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Probation Department "needs a lot more people than the county can afford," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To help out with that shortage, Jackson is making the rounds of City Council 
meetings in the county to raise public awareness about the program and look for 
more volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the county Probation Department started the program last March, 41 
people have been trained to be volunteer probation officers, said Gerry 
Schiller, program coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications are currently being accepted through early May for the next 
training session in September, Schiller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers must be at least 20 years old, commit to a minimum of 20 hours a 
month of work for one year and agree to a background investigation and 
psychological evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiller said volunteers are supervised by a deputy probation officer, who 
helps them with their caseloads. 
</P>
<P>
 Responsibilities include interviewing offenders and their families; making 
home, work and jail visits to monitor offenders; and working with youths in 
drug treatment programs, according to Schiller. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said she volunteered because she wanted to fight crime and increase 
public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm making sure that the public's interest is being served by seeing that 
these people are not violating the program or are not a danger to the 
community," she said. "The more volunteers, the more safety there is for the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said the volunteer work is rewarding because she is "helping to 
protect the community and helping offenders turn their lives around." 
</P>
<P>
 Those interested in volunteering can call Schiller at (714) 569-2153 or Randy 
Niznik at (714) 569-2152 for more information. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; GROUP TO SEEK CITY SUPPORT FOR FESTIVAL

<P>
 In a move intended to attract gays and lesbians from surrounding communities 
to visit the city, a local support group is planning the city's first Gay and 
Lesbian Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-sponsor Laguna Outreach is seeking city support for the festival, which 
will include a kick-off party April 29 followed by the weekend event on the 
Festival of Arts grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoters say they hope the two-day celebration will become an annual event. 
</P>
<P>
 The group will not be asking for money at Tuesday's City Council meeting, but 
rather for "moral support," said Laguna Outreach co-chairman Doug Reilly. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival will benefit the city by increasing sales tax revenue. "This is 
one more of a multi-pronged effort to bring people to Laguna Beach," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter from Reilly to the city says the festival "is part of a larger 
(Laguna Outreach) effort to promote Laguna Beach as a resort to the gay and 
lesbian community in Southern California and throughout the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council commonly endorses community events and Councilman Robert F. 
Gentry is asking his colleagues to support the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the festival is expected to promote business for city restaurants, art 
galleries and hotels, Laguna Outreach will also seek support from the Chamber 
of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival will feature a variety of entertainment, including pop and 
country-Western music, dancing and performances by local comedians. 
</P>
<P>
 The memo to the city says money generated by the celebration will be used 
partly to help defray festival expenses and to support a similar event next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder would go to Laguna Shanti, an AIDS support group that is 
co-sponsoring the event; Orange County Cultural Pride, which sponsors the 
Lesbian and Gay Pride Festival in August; and Laguna Outreach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Beach festival is also being co-sponsored by the Coast Inn, home of 
the Boom Boom Room, a gay bar in town. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual Lesbian and Gay Pride Festival has drawn thousands of participants 
in recent years. LESLIE EARNEST

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; DRUG AWARENESS CAMPAIGN STARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to heighten awareness of alcohol and drug problems in the Latino 
community, a coalition of groups will sponsor a weeklong educational campaign 
in east Oxnard's La Colonia area. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning today, the Colonia Coalition on Alcohol and Other Drugs will sponsor 
a series of workshops on five consecutive nights, said Rigoberto Vargas, a 
program assistant for El Concilio del Condado de Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an over-representation of problems with driving under the influence 
in the Latino community, and a problem in the Colonia area with the number of 
alcohol outlets," Vargas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshops will take place from 6 to 8 p.m. at the Ramona Adult Center, 804 
Cooper Road, Oxnard. Each night's program will focus on a different topic, 
including "Drugs and HIV/AIDS" and "Driving Under the Influence." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides El Concilio, the Colonia Coalition includes members from the La 
Colonia Village Tenants Assn., Oxnard Police Department, Oxnard Housing 
Authority, and Ventura County Drug and Alcohol Programs. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, following the workshops, the coalition will sponsor a family 
festival, " Tardeada en el Parque Sin Alcohol y Drogas ," to promote clean and 
sober entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, which will include live music, dance contests and ballet, will also 
feature health education about alcohol and other drug use and abuse. The 
tardeada will take place from noon to 4 p.m. in the stadium at Del Sol Park, 
1500 Colonia Road. For information, call Vargas at 983-2336. PATRICK McCARTNEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; CITY PLANS TO REDUCE ITS AIR SHOW COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Irvine officials plan to reduce the amount of money the city spends on traffic 
control during the annual El Toro Air Show, which is scheduled for April 29, 
April 30 and May 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department has traditionally provided traffic management services 
for the event -- at a cost to the city of about $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The air show is one of the county's most popular events and attracts more than 
1 million people from around Southern California to the El Toro Marine Corps 
Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, the city hopes to spend just a few thousand dollars on the 
event through a series of personnel shifts and other cost-cutting measures, 
Police Chief Charles S. Brobeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 To cut the size of the bill, Brobeck plans to use reserve officers and police 
explorers to do a greater amount of traffic control work than they have in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 Brobeck also hopes to greatly reduce overtime costs by having officers work 
the weekend event as part of their regular shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers would then take time off during the week. 
</P>
<P>
 These changes will mean fewer officers will be available to handle 
traffic-related calls three days before and three days after the air show, 
Brobeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city explored whether the El Toro base could defray some of the costs of 
traffic controls. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials discovered that federal laws prevent the military from sharing 
the costs for such services, Brobeck said. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; A RISING STAR ON TV AND IN EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With his smart blue blazer and tie, his sharply combed hair and quietly 
eloquent talk about his love of education, Curt Visca appears a model of the 
serious and disciplined elementary school principal. At first glance, he looks 
sort of like a young, South County Mr. Chips. 
</P>
<P>
 Then you notice the Elvis Presley clock swaying its pendulum legs on his 
office wall and, on the bookshelf, the plastic plate of petrified spaghetti, 
its fork suspended in mid-twirl. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, this really could be the guy whom cable television-watching children call 
all sorts of names -- like Sammy Surf, Yawney Johnny, Lester (Lunker) Smith, 
Pirate Petey, Slowpoke Joe, Handy Dandy Handyman, Mr. Wizard the Wiz, Paul E. 
Tician -- all names of characters Visca has portrayed on his avidly watched 
television show "It's Curtoon Time." 
</P>
<P>
 For seven years while a teacher, assistant principal and interim principal in 
the Capistrano Unified School District, Visca has produced a show a week on 
Dimension Cable. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though he's taking on new duties in September as principal of the 
district's creative and visual arts school -- Bathgate Elementary in Mission 
Viejo -- the 30-year-old Visca says the show will go on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have hobbies," Visca said. "Some people collect stamps or coins. Well, 
my hobby is being on television with my show." 
</P>
<P>
 The format of Visca's show has remained the same since he started taping it in 
his kitchen for the public access channel seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether dressed up like nerdy candidate Paul E. Tician, goofy fisherman Lester 
(Lunker) Smith or 144-year-old Mr. Wizard the Wiz, Visca methodically shows his 
young viewers how to draw simple, happy-faced cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want kids to be real comfortable with drawing," he said. "People feel good 
if they can draw things." 
</P>
<P>
 As he draws, Visca maintains an ad-libbed monologue sprinkled with educational 
tidbits about science, math, nutrition and other subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, after Visca built a solid following, Dimension Cable provided 
him with a production crew and studio. 
</P>
<P>
 He now records two shows every two weeks, which are shown at 5:30 in the 
morning and evening. 
</P>
<P>
 With the professional help and better equipment, the show added a few MTV 
touches like on-screen graphics, jerky hand-held cameras and the "Fish-Cam" 
that recently shot Lester (Lunker) Smith from the water line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the kid show of the '90s," Visca proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 He might be right, at least among Dimension's 180,000 subscribers, said its 
community programming director, C. Yvette Welch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is one of the most popular shows we have on our local programming," Welch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his "Curtoon Time" notoriety, Visca -- currently the interim principal 
at Marian Bergeson Elementary in Laguna Niguel -- doesn't bring his TV 
characters into his role as school leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Such seriousness made Visca an easy choice to run his own school, said Richard 
Thome, Capistrano Unified's assistant superintendent for instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very much a bottom-line leader who wants the best for children," Thome 
said. "When you see him in very serious, conflict situations that are not fun, 
he shows a degree of toughness that you won't see on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 From early on, Visca has stood out, said the district's community relations 
director Jackie Price. 
</P>
<P>
 She first met him when he was her student at National University, studying for 
his master's degree in education. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very talented and uplifting kind of leader," Price said. "I just saw 
him as a rising star." RICHARD CORE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; KIDNAPING REPORTED BY WOMAN DRIVER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man forced his way into an Oxnard woman's car while she was stopped at a 
Ventura intersection and made her to drive him to the San Fernando Valley, 
Ventura police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 32-year-old woman told investigators that she was stopped at a traffic 
light at Wake Forest Avenue and Telegraph Road about noon Saturday when an 
unknown man opened her passenger-side door and sat next to her. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, whose description was not provided by police, then ordered the 
woman to drive south on the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 A police spokeswoman said the man told the woman to exit at Reseda Boulevard, 
then he jumped out of the car. At no time did he display a weapon, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 She then returned home and called police at 8:15 p.m. Saturday. The case is 
being investigated as a felony kidnaping. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: EL RIO; COUNTY OKS PLANS TO BUILD STORM DRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to complaints by El Rio residents upset about flooded streets after 
each heavy rain, Ventura County will spend $1.4 million to build a storm drain 
in the tiny community. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last couple of years, Supervisor John K. Flynn, whose district 
includes the area, has received a number of complaints from residents, an aide 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these people felt the county was ignoring them," said Catherine 
Serros, an administrative aide working for Flynn. "That's why we initiated the 
process with public works." 
</P>
<P>
 The 5,100-foot-long storm drain will draw water off Cortez Street from Salem 
Avenue to Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The concrete pipeline will range from five feet to more than seven feet in 
diameter. Storm water will be collected in catch basins to be constructed along 
Cortez. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the county's Public Works Department said that bids on the 
project would be advertised in May and that the seven-month construction 
project will begin in June. Because the plans for the storm drain have not been 
completed, the cost could rise, officials said. SCOTT HADLY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; DISTRICT, JOBS AGENCY RESOLVE PACT DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard Union High School District and a local jobs agency have resolved a 
contract dispute that had threatened the existence of a work-training program 
for about 150 welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials and the Oxnard-based Job Training Policy Council have agreed 
to a new contract, approved by the school board last week, under which the 
council will reimburse the district each month for the costs of running the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really a cooperative move on both our parts," Assistant Supt. Bob 
Brown said. "We were able to sit down and work it out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard school board has for seven years operated a program for adult 
welfare recipients called Greater Avenues in Independence, or GAIN. 
</P>
<P>
 The federally funded council pays about $83,000 to the district each year to 
run the program, which includes courses in English as a Second Language and 
remedial math and reading. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the district receives about $156,000 from the Ventura County 
Public Social Services Agency and another $134,000 from the state Department of 
Education for the program. But the payments from the county and state are 
contingent upon the school district first having a contract with the jobs 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 And the council proposed last fall to change its GAIN contract to allow 
payment of only half the $83,000 upfront, withholding the rest until after the 
yearlong program is done. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs council officials had said they needed time to audit the school 
district's expenses for the program each year before paying out the federal 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 When this proposal sparked angry complaints from school officials, council 
officials agreed to meet with the district to work out a new contract. MAIA 
DAVIS

Q: WHAT TEAM PLACES 3RD IN STATE ACADEMIC DECATHLON? A: LAGUNA HILLS; 
COMPETITION: MONTHS OF HARD WORK PAY OFF FOR ALL-STAR GROUP'S NINE MEMBERS, WHO 
ALSO TAKE HOME SIX INDIVIDUAL MEDALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Members of Laguna Hills High School's academic decathlon team left for home a 
little heavier Sunday, laden with medals they won at the 15th annual California 
Academic Decathlon here. 
</P>
<P>
 The team of nine academic all-stars finished in third place in the statewide 
competition held at the University of the Pacific, and second place among 
medium-sized schools. Alex Fung, 17, led the Laguna Hills Hawks with two 
individual medals. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills High team members took home six individual medals for first, 
second or third place in three academic events. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft High School of Woodland Hills won the overall state title with 48,974 
points out of a possible 60,000, followed by West High School of Torrance with 
46,278 points. Laguna Hills High notched 43,049 points. Forty-two schools from 
throughout the state competed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of neat that the top three teams were from Southern California," 
said Laguna Hills' Loren Colin, 18, who was awarded a first-place medal in 
social studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft High, which had won the state crown four times, will head to the national 
championship in Newark, N.J., April 15-17. 
</P>
<P>
 Academic decathlon contestants took exams in six areas: mathematics, science, 
social studies, economics, languages and literature, and fine arts. 
</P>
<P>
 They also did live interviews, wrote essays and gave speeches in addition to 
the Super Quiz, a multiple-choice competition held in front of screaming 
parents and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The results satisfied many of the parents, who cheered along with the 
teen-agers when medals were handed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hoping we'd finished in the top five," said Lynn Colin, Loren's 
mother. "So we're very happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the teens bettered that goal, finishing in the top three, some team 
members were disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have done better," said Fung, who won a silver medal in the interview 
category and a bronze in math. "It's discouraging because you work so hard for 
the whole year and the scores don't reflect that." 
</P>
<P>
 In Saturday's Super Quiz event, Laguna Hills finished second, just ahead of a 
team from Sacramento County. The two teams ended the Super Quiz competition in 
a tie, but Laguna Hills gained points after judges later disallowed a quiz 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches praised 17-year-old team captain Megan Ferrell, who volunteered to 
help her teammates brush up on problem subjects to prepare for the contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trophy is hers," said coach Kathy Lane, pointing to Ferrell, who held a 
huge third-place trophy in her hands. "She sacrificed herself; she gave up 
being on the basketball team and going to hockey games to help everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 The team also includes seniors Genevieve Go, Jamie Miller, Renn Amstead, Terry 
James, Romy Christensen and Bryan Cotta. They were coached by Lane and Roger 
Gunderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills team members, who were Orange County's delegates at the 
tournament, began competing Friday against students representing 42 schools 
from Amador to Yolo counties. Team members started studying for the 
mind-wrenching competition last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just going to go home," James said after walking off the awards 
platform with medals around his neck. "We're going to have a cookout and burn 
all our (study) materials."

MARINE OFFICER IS KILLED, 4 SERVICEMEN HURT IN CRASH; ACCIDENT: THEIR 
TUSTIN-BASED HELICOPTER LANDS TAIL-FIRST AND EXPLODES ON A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA 
RUNWAY.

 A Marine officer was killed and four other servicemen were injured Saturday 
when their Tustin-based helicopter landed tail-first and burst into flames on 
the runway at the Mountain Warfare Training Center in Bridgeport in Northern 
California, the military said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The co-pilot, Lt. James Amature, 27, died of massive injuries in the 3 p.m. 
accident during a "routine training mission" involving a CH-53D Super Stallion 
helicopter, according to Marine Corps spokesman Sgt. Barry L. Pawelek. 
</P>
<P>
 Pawelek said the transport-and-supply helicopter from the Marine Heavy 
Helicopter Squadron 363 from the Tustin Marine Corps Air Station was landing 
when "the bottom two wheels of the plane, near the tail," hit the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopter burst into flames and "destroyed most of the aircraft," Pawelek 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the accident hasn't been determined and an investigation is 
continuing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot, 40-year-old Maj. David Peterson of Fairborne, Ohio, was in 
satisfactory condition Sunday, said a nurse at Washoe Medical Center in Reno. 
No conditions were immediately available for the other injured Marines, 
identified as the crew chief, Corp. John McCarthy, 29, of Randolph, Mass., and 
crewman Lance Corp. Vincent Pirato, 30, of Drexel Hills, Penn. 
</P>
<P>
 Also hurt was Capt. Kerry Bartlett, who is attached to the Mountain Warfare 
Training Center, according to Pawelek. 
</P>
<P>
 Amature, Peterson and McCarthy were involved in U.S.-led relief efforts in 
Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Amature was from New York City. He is survived by his parents and two 
brothers, also from New York. 
</P>
<P>
 CH-53 Super Stallions are heavy-lift helicopters, the largest of their kind 
made outside the former Soviet Union. The chopper can lift up to its weight of 
16 tons and is used to transport weapons, light armored vehicles and troops. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been three other crashes involving Marine helicopters over the past 
year, killing seven servicemen and one civilian. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Marines and an Army pilot were killed Sept. 8 when two Super Cobra 
attack helicopters collided during a military exercise at the Marine Corps 
training base at Twentynine Palms. Two other Marines died less than 24 hours 
later in the crash of another Cobra near San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Aug. 16, two men -- one a civilian photographer -- died in a midair 
collision of two Marine helicopters over the ocean off Dana Point. One of the 
aircraft was a UH-1N Huey helicopter and the other was a Super Cobra based at 
Camp Pendleton.

DRIVER DIES WHEN CAR HITS I-5 DIVIDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 70-year-old woman was killed Sunday afternoon when her car slammed into a 
divider wall on the Santa Ana Freeway and then flipped over, a California 
Highway Patrol spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Hamburg of Riverside was driving southbound with her infant grandson 
when she tried to slow down for an upcoming traffic jam near Broadway in Santa 
Ana, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traveling at 55 m.p.h., Hamburg braked too hard, causing the car to skid out 
of control and into a divider wall before overturning, CHP officials said. No 
other cars were involved.  
</P>
<P>
 Hamburg died at UCI Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Her grandson, 4-month-old Keith Anthony Hamburg, was unharmed, authorities 
said, because he was secured in a baby car seat attached to the front passenger 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Hamburg was not wearing a seat belt, the spokesman said.

MIKE PENNER: UC IRVINE MAKES UP FOR LOST SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No one sleeps in Insomnia City, not even Anteaters, who, after six years of 
brick-induced hibernation, tossed and turned for four days here and nearly woke 
up in the NCAA basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was really prepared for this, either, least of all UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteater band pulled out of town after Thursday's first round of the Big 
West Tournament, never expecting the Anteater basketball team to be playing on 
three rounds later. For musical accompaniment Sunday, Irvine hired the band 
that plays at UNLV's women's basketball games -- the Vegas 'B' band -- and 
asked it nicely to hold up a ZOT! sign every so often. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteater cheerleaders had scattered, as well, with four of them turning 
out for Sunday's championship final. That meant New Mexico State had Irvine out 
pom-ponned, 23 cheerleaders to four. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteater rooting section, including one guy with a yellow "I" painted on 
his chest (U and C apparently stayed home), maxed out at around 200, up from 
the 30 who were on hand Thursday. "We always have 30," Irvine Athletic Director 
Dan Guerrero noted proudly. "From there, it grew exponentially." 
</P>
<P>
 So, against all odds and indicators, did the performance of Irvine's 
basketball team. Since its last appearance in the Big West final, 1988, Irvine 
had finished basketball seasons with records of 12-17, 5-23, 11-19 and, under 
Rod Baker, 7-22, 6-21 and 7-19 heading into this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading into this week, Irvine was the 10th-place team in the Big West, which, 
in the Big West, is the same thing as last place. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, with 40 seconds to play in the Big West title game, Irvine and 
NCAA-tournament regular New Mexico State were separated by three points, just a 
jump shot away. And with Chris Brown, the most accurate trey-maker in the NCAA 
on the Anteaters' side, a three-point deficit is next to nothing, as easy to 
sweep aside as a flick of the wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who'd already canned 11 three-pointers against the Aggies, got the 
ball, just as everyone inside Thomas & Mack Arena expected, but couldn't get 
off a shot. For once, an Aggie, Thomas Wyatt, was right in his face. 
</P>
<P>
 So Brown dumped the ball inside to center DeForrest Boyer for a bank shot that 
failed. New Mexico rebounded, Boyer fouled the rebounder and, two free throws 
later, the NCAA selection committee finally put away the Rolaids. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico State's 70-64 victory meant never having to say you're sorry for 
the proliferation of these postseason conference tournaments that have turned 
qualifying for the NCAA field into a virtual all-comers meet. With a couple 
different bounces of the ball, Tom Butters would be explaining today how an 
11-19 last-place team belongs in his tournament and Dick Vitale would be 
dragging his fingernails across every Anteater joke in the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the Anteaters much cared. Baker, so embattled through his first three 
seasons at Irvine, called his team's relentless climb through the Big West 
bracket "a good story, a nice story, a story that continued to build. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tomorrow, it would have been a great story." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker had promised big things when he first arrived at Irvine in mid-1991 -- 
bidding for the NCAAs being high on his list -- but never detailed this kind of 
route. His team squeaked into this tournament only after conference officials 
voted to expand the field from eight teams to 10, then systematically knocked 
off the No. 7 seed, Santa Barbara, the No. 2 seed, Utah State, and the No. 6 
seed, Pacific, on consecutive nights. 
</P>
<P>
 As they cleared out their half of the draw, the Anteaters cleared out the 
arena as well. By outlasting UNLV and Long Beach State, Irvine turned Thomas & 
Mack into Thomas . . . & Mack Wasn't Invited. Official attendance Sunday was 
listed at 4,052. That's less than 25% capacity, turning Irvine's moment in the 
sun into a very private viewing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters failed to notice, but then, they are used to life away from the 
masses in the Bren Center. So with a studio audience looking on, Brown put 
together a one-man highlight reel that ought to be copied and shown to every 
alumnus and potential season-ticket buyer Guerrero can round up in the next six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown attempted 22 field goals, 21 from beyond 19 feet 9 inches. He made 11 of 
them, accounting for 33 points -- more than half Irvine's total offense -- and 
leaving Aggie Coach Neil McCarthy wiping his brow between nervous glances at 
the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris Brown was impossible," McCarthy said from behind the post-game dais. 
"My goodness, he can shoot. He's dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a junior, returns next season, as do starting forwards LaDay Smith and 
Mark Odsather and top reserves Jermaine Avie, Todd Whitehead, Shaun Battle and 
Zuri Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program is going to get better and better," claimed Brown, who admitted 
he spent most of this season scratching his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd beat New Mexico State at home, lose to Northridge, beat Iowa, lose to 
Fullerton. Too many times, we thought the games were already won before we 
played. We'd go to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this tournament put a light in our eyes and showed us that if we play 
hard next year, we could be the ones cutting down the nets." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker couldn't have timed this run any better if he tried, although he 
insists, "I don't worry about my job." Guerrero, however, still plans to sit 
down with Baker in the next few weeks and discuss "the future of the program." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll both go into that meeting with smiles on our faces," Guerrero 
said. "The way we played the last four days is the way we expected this team to 
play all season . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "This program has the potential to be successful. When I say successful, I 
don't mean going to the NCAAs five years in a row like New Mexico State. I want 
us to show improvement, knock on the NIT's door, get into the NIT or NCAAs 
every so often, be a solid contender year in and year out." 
</P>
<P>
 This week was a start. Not a great story, as Baker suggested, "but a nice 
story. And nice beats going out with a whimper by a whole bunch."

MORE TIME, AND MUMFORD MIGHT HAVE CUT DOWN NETS; BASKETBALL: IRVINE SENIOR, WHO 
HAD 12 POINTS AND 10 ASSISTS IN HIS FINAL GAME, LAMENTS CLOSE LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It was the most painful of reality checks for UC Irvine point guard Lloyd 
Mumford. 
</P>
<P>
 He established himself as a big-time tournament player in Vegas, with his 
twisting drives, clutch shots, crisp, pin-point passes and sweet ballhandling. 
But now Mumford's college career and Irvine's surprising run through the Big 
West Tournament were over. 
</P>
<P>
 Mumford and the 10th-seeded Anteaters were left watching top-seeded New Mexico 
State celebrate a 70-64 victory, and an automatic berth into the NCAA 
basketball tournament, Sunday at the Thomas & Mack Center. 
</P>
<P>
 It could have been the Anteaters, who entered the conference tournament with a 
7-19 record and a last-place finish in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 It could have been the Anteaters making their first trip to the NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 And it could have been Mumford playing one more game, extending his senior 
season one more week. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it's over. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts," said Mumford, who finished with 12 points and 10 assists. "A 
couple of missed foul shots and 10 or 15 more seconds and we could have been 
going to the big dance instead of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the worst thing about this is that we know we could have been the ones 
going." 
</P>
<P>
 That thought haunted Mumford and his teammates as they watched New Mexico 
State players cut down the nets. Irvine's frustrating 10-20 season had come to 
an end, and for Mumford and fellow seniors DeForrest Boyer and Joe Hannon, so 
did a college career. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Aggies carried off the championship trophy, Mumford left the arena with 
a travel bag hanging from his shoulder, a consolation prize for making the 
all-tournament team with Anteater junior Chris Brown, who scored 33 points, all 
on three-pointers, in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeing them cut down the nets and get the trophy was a big deal to us," said 
Brown, who was named the tournament's co-MVP with New Mexico State's James 
Dockery. "I hate to think about it, that it could have been me up there cutting 
it down." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a discouraging moment for Brown, a transfer from Bakersfield College 
and one of three starters expected back next season. But he thinks the 
Anteaters' surprising run through the tournament gives them something to build 
on next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine upset seventh-seeded UC Santa Barbara (53-48), second-seeded Utah State 
(78-68) and sixth-seeded Pacific (82-78) to earn its first appearance in the 
conference finals since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "This tournament meant the world to us," said Mumford, who averaged 18.2 
points in the tournament, including totals of 29 against Pacific and 26 against 
Utah State. "It felt great for us to go out and do things that people never 
thought we could do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hadn't played on a team that has won three in a row in I don't know how 
long." 
</P>
<P>
 It could have been four in a row, but the Anteaters tired in the final minutes 
and the Aggies, who shot only 56% from the free-throw line during the regular 
season, made eight of their final 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown tied it, 62-62, on a three-pointer with 2 minutes 39 seconds left, but 
the Aggies scored eight of the game's next 10 points, all on free throws, to 
pull away.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think fatigue was a factor," said Brown, who played 39 minutes and 
made 11 of 21 three-pointers over New Mexico State's zone defense. "We were 
more pumped up for this game than any other. We were in the frame of mind that 
we were going to the NCAA tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Anteaters watched as the Aggie players, one by one, climbed the 
ladder and cut the net. Irvine Coach Rod Baker gathered his players around him 
during the celebration, and pointed down the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "He us not to hang our heads and to look down there at them," Brown said, "He 
told as that someday, we could be cutting down the nets, too."

WESTERN'S BELL FINDS WAY THROUGH WOODS; GOLF: SENIOR STUDIED THE TECHNIQUE OF 
HIS FAMOUS TEAMMATE TO DISCOVER HIS GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Western High senior Bryon Bell is a high school golfer with an exceptional 
swing. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a swing that has been compared favorably to Sam Snead's and broken down 
and analyzed on three pages of a national golf magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Bell, the swing in question isn't his own. Teammate Tiger 
Woods owns it; Bell's is only an uncanny simulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell started playing golf seriously three years ago and did much of his 
learning next to Woods on the driving range. Somehow Bell's swing started to 
look a lot like Woods'. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really know how it happened," Bell said. "We were working together 
and we suddenly realized we were doing the same things wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, he's hitting the ball better." 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, of course, swings with the nation's best young golfers. He has won a 
record six Junior World titles and the last three USGA Junior Amateur 
championships. He has accepted a golf scholarship from Stanford. He has played 
in a handful events on the PGA Tour as an amateur and expects one day to be a 
full-fledged Tour member. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell, 6 feet 2, has done none of that and never will. He's an average golfer 
-- about a 12 handicap, he figures -- but he is comfortable with his place in 
the golf world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I play to have fun," Bell said. "I'm not out there to make a living or 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell shouldn't have any problem making a living without golf. He has a 4.2 
grade-point average and has been accepted to UC San Diego and UC Irvine and is 
awaiting responses from Stanford and California. He hopes to become a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Before joining the Western team as a freshman, Bell had played golf only 
occasionally and it showed. 
</P>
<P>
 "His swing wasn't very consistent, but you could see all the potential he 
had," Woods said. "The foundation was there and he's a very fast learner. He 
picks up on things that you tell him very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Bell's aptitude for the game comes from playing baseball. Until he was 
16, he was a pretty good youth baseball player -- a shortstop and right-handed 
pitcher ("I struck a lot of people out, I guess."). 
</P>
<P>
 When he started high school, he wanted to dedicate himself to another sport 
because of a medical condition. Early in his childhood, doctors discovered a 
heart murmur and limited his activity. He wasn't allowed to play football, 
basketball or soccer, or other sports in which extreme physical exertion was 
likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball was acceptable as long as he made sure his heart wasn't beating too 
quickly. That meant arrangements with coaches to excuse him from lifting 
weights and running. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that didn't seem like a good way to excel in athletics, he turned to 
golf. 
</P>
<P>
 As a freshman, Bell was the seventh man on the Western varsity, which meant he 
played with Coach Don Crosby and his scores -- mostly in the high 40s for nine 
holes -- didn't count. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours with Woods at the range and a job at Cypress Golf Club helped him make 
steady progress, and the past two seasons he has been Western's No. 2 player. 
</P>
<P>
 In most matches, Woods and Bell play in the same foursome and help each other 
through rough spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have swing problems, he'll just look at my swing and tell me what I'm 
doing wrong or vice versa," Woods said. "It always seems like we're working on 
the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 This season, he and Woods, the team's only seniors, are working with their 
teammates, sophomores David Dawson, Joe Hallada and Vince Branstetter and 
junior Ben Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
 "He and Tiger have really done a good job this year of being more active 
leaders and working with the kids," Crosby said. "They're seniors and they're 
older. Last year they just hung back and we just tried to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pioneers, who finished 9-9 and in third place in the Orange League last 
year, are 3-1 after two weeks of this season. Woods and Bell hope the team can 
challenge favorites Brea-Olinda and Valencia for the league title. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, who has won three consecutive individual league titles, is shooting at 
or below par in most matches. Bell is usually several strokes higher, but isn't 
worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten to the point that I can play bad and still shoot a decent score," 
he said. "I don't get too upset over what I shoot."

MIGHTY DUCKS' SHTALENKOV WEARS VICTORY WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No, those weren't the Montreal Canadiens slapping shots at goaltender Mikhail 
Shtalenkov on Sunday afternoon in Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, it didn't matter who wore the opposing jerseys. What counted most 
of all for Shtalenkov were the final numbers on the scoreboard: 
</P>
<P>
 Mighty Ducks 5, Ottawa Senators 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Years from now, when memories of a 90-degree Orange County Sunday fade, 
Shtalenkov can bend the story of his first victory any way he likes. 
</P>
<P>
 Will anyone in Moscow, his hometown, remember it came against one of the 
weakest NHL teams in more than 20 seasons? 
</P>
<P>
 What counted most on Sunday, was that he and the Ducks won. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just happy today because of my first NHL win," Shtalenkov said after 
stopping 27 of 28 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wait a long time for this game." 
</P>
<P>
 Shtalenkov, 28, an NHL rookie who started his fourth game Sunday, finally came 
away a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as Feb. 20, he was content to tend goal for the San Diego Gulls of 
the International Hockey League.  
</P>
<P>
 But then, "Somebody call and I went to St. Louis," Shtalenkov said. "Surprise, 
but good surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks traded goalie Ron Tugnutt, who shared the starting spot with Guy 
Hebert until then, to Montreal for goal-scoring forward Stephan Lebeau. They 
also promoted Shtalenkov, who joined them in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Shtalenkov's fine play at San Diego (15-11-2 record and 3.45 goals-against 
average in 28 games) and Hebert's hot streak around the All-Star break (3-2-2 
in seven starts) allowed the Ducks to make a move. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always thought he could challenge to be No. 1," said Jack Ferreira, Duck 
general manager. "From Day 1 I always felt our greatest depth was at 
goaltender. Once it got sorted out who was one, two, three, then we could make 
a move for a scorer." 
</P>
<P>
 They had to be careful, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he was an older, European player, the Ducks couldn't simply send 
Shtalenkov to the minors. NHL rules say: You sign him, you have to keep him on 
the major league roster. Send him down and he has to clear waivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know Hartford was looking at him," Ferreira said. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Ducks, keeping Hebert and Tugnutt in Anaheim as Nos. 1 and 1A, sent 
Shtalenkov to San Diego on a conditioning assignment. It was the only way to 
avoid the waiver wire. 
</P>
<P>
 Turned out he was in pretty fair shape. He was up briefly for starts against 
Vancouver and Toronto. He was good in one and awful in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Back to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 When he caught Ferreira's eye again, the trade was made and he returned . . . 
to sit on the bench for seven of the 10 games leading up to Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Shtalenkov held the Senators scoreless for more than 48 minutes until Dennis 
Vial swatted a rebound past him for their only goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (a shutout) would be great," Shtalenkov said. "But it's not important. If 
we win it's most important."

THE TIMES 1994 WINTER ALL-COUNTY TEAMS; JUDKINS' PLAY HAS BROUGHT MARINA TO 
ANOTHER LEVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If the criteria for player of the year came down to natural talent, Marina 
Coach Dave McLeish acknowledged that his sweeper, Dan Judkins, probably 
wouldn't be in the running. 
</P>
<P>
 But if he had to choose one player to start a team, Judkins would be his man. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Orange County soccer coaches agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't have the physical ability of (Corona del Mar's) Jason Boyce, but 
he understands the game better than any kid I've ever had," said McLeish, who 
has coached high school soccer for 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
 A Sunset League coach who watched Judkins play for four years made a similar 
observation: "The team doesn't make the playoffs without him. With him, they 
are an overtime goal from being league champs." 
</P>
<P>
 Marina was also an overtime goal from advancing to the Southern Section 
Division I semifinals, which still frustrates Judkins. 
</P>
<P>
 "The toughest part about losing was seeing Claremont go all the way after we 
lost to them, 3-2, in overtime," he said. "We had our chances too. I missed a 
breakaway in overtime." 
</P>
<P>
 But Judkins didn't miss many scoring opportunities. From his sweeper position, 
he tied with forwards Mike Harris and Jose Monroy for the team lead in goals 
with 10. He also had nine assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Judkins had been Marina's center midfielder for three years before he switched 
positions early this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense wasn't as strong this year and I asked my coach if I could move 
back to help the out team," Judkins said. "I think it settled the team and we 
were a lot more organized after that. I'm a little more vocal than some people 
and I can see the field." 
</P>
<P>
 McLeish said Judkins' sacrifice turned around the Vikings' season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me, 'It isn't as important for me to play a position where I can 
score as it is for me to play where I can help the team,' " McLeish said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, Judkins will be helping SMU's soccer team. He signed a letter of 
intent with SMU in March after also considering Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 McLeish said he doesn't have any doubts that Judkins will continue his success 
at the college level. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people that are close to Dan in skills, but the 
intelligence, the heart and the passion will take him to the next level," he 
said. "You can never predict what's going to happen, but you get the feeling 
with Dan that he'll be just fine."

THE TIMES 1994 WINTER ALL-COUNTY TEAMS; CAMPBELL'S MOVE PROVIDES SPARK FOR 
MARINA'S OFFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the Marina girls' soccer team entered this season as the overwhelming 
favorite to win its second consecutive Southern Section Division I title, Coach 
Bobby Bruch knew the Vikings had a key weakness: putting the ball in the net. 
</P>
<P>
 With leading scorer Amy Peterson graduated and playing for USC and standout 
midfielder Rhiannon Tanaka sure to draw crowds of defenders even when she 
didn't have the ball, Bruch needed to find a dangerous scoring weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Cassie Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew somebody was going to have to pick up the slack and she was my 
choice," Bruch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Good choice. Campbell, a junior, moved from midfielder to forward and became 
one of the most feared players on the Southern Section's best team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I needed a big game, she was there," Bruch said. "And that makes 
her stand out from the rest of the players, not only on our team but in the 
rest of the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, The Times Orange County player of the year, finished with 29 goals 
and 14 assists, accounting for more than half of the Vikings' 80 goals. In the 
playoffs, she scored three times, one in each of the victories over South 
Torrance, Mater Dei and Palos Verdes Peninsula as Marina (28-0-1) won the 
Division I title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings extended their unbeaten streak to 39 games, the third-longest 
streak in Orange County history, after Mission Viejo's 84 (1986-89) and El 
Toro's 42 (1990-91). 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell's most important contribution during the playoffs was an assist in a 
first-round game. With the score tied, 1-1, and Dana Hills' goalkeeper Sumone 
Nicole stopping everything coming her way, Campbell got free on a breakaway 
with one minute left in regulation. Campbell's angle to the goal was bad, so 
instead forcing a shot as she neared the end line, she turned and passed to a 
waiting Amy Rubenstein, who put it in from the near post. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things were getting a little tense," Campbell said. "But something told me 
that we'd score. I knew our team could come back. We have character."

WORSENING JOB SITUATION WEIGHS ON EUROPEANS; G-7 SUMMIT: AS MINISTERS MEET IN 
DETROIT, CONTINENT ENDURES HISTORIC RATES OF UNEMPLOYMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER MARSHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Official figures released last week confirmed what most western European 
political leaders already knew: Unemployment in the region, already alarmingly 
high, had jumped again. 
</P>
<P>
 As President Clinton prepares to welcome government ministers to the Group of 
Seven "jobs summit" today in Detroit, nowhere in the industrialized world does 
the problem of unemployment have a higher political priority than in Europe, 
nowhere is the issue more emotionally charged -- and nowhere do the prospects 
for a solution seem bleaker. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, European participants bring with them a record that is hardly a 
model to follow. And they seem to have few expectations that the summit will 
dent their collective crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Pascal Lamy, a senior aide to European Commission President Jacques Delors, 
said Europeans were hoping the Detroit meeting would be "an open-minded 
brainstorming session" that would send a message back home that their leaders 
care about jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (the G-7 nations) are from different cultures, but we have common 
problems," he said. "It is important to see if there's enough convergence to 
agree on some common principles that we can feed into the Naples summit" -- a 
reference to the next full meeting of the G-7 in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Delors, whose shared concern about unemployment was said to have helped prompt 
Clinton to call the jobs summit, was originally scheduled to travel to Detroit. 
But he canceled his trip on short notice after crucial new negotiations over 
the EU's enlargement were rescheduled for Tuesday in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Henning Christophersen, the European Union's commissioner for 
economic and financial affairs, will carry what is expected to be Europe's main 
contribution -- a discussion document known as the Delors White Paper drawn up 
with the goal of creating 15 million new jobs in Europe before the end of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that only about two-thirds that number of jobs were created in the 
EU region over the past two decades, the goal is ambitious. 
</P>
<P>
 The Europeans are suggesting a mixture of accelerated public works programs, 
work-sharing and job training schemes, together with a look at the impact on 
unemployment of western Europe's unusually high wage costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it was presented to an EU summit here last December, parts of the Delors 
paper have been transformed into an action plan but so far have not been 
implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal was developed as a response to Europe's worsening unemployment 
crisis. The continent is still stalled in the depths of its longest, deepest 
recession since World War II. Most economic forecasters expect the number of 
jobless in the 12-nation European Union -- a group that includes most of the 
continent's richest countries -- to continue rising from its present record 
high of 16.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In Germany, where the total number without work last month topped 4 million 
for the first time since the Weimar era, jobs constitute the main election year 
issue. More than 3 million people are jobless in France. 
</P>
<P>
 In southern Europe, the crisis is even more acute, with youth unemployment 
last month hitting 39.2% in Spain and running at more than 31% in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even the unexpected strength of the U.S. economy in recent months and 
initial signs that the recession in Europe may finally have hit bottom are 
likely to be enough to ease unemployment in the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is simple: Europe's jobs crisis goes well beyond the present 
recession. Indeed, it has been festering since the early 1970s, as western 
Europe's welfare states began to mature and its aging industrial base first 
felt competitive pressures from lower-wage economies. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, while Europe's welfare states provide a dizzying array of benefits for 
its people, these same benefits have become so expensive that they have begun 
to price European goods -- and jobs -- out of world markets. 
</P>
<P>
 While the average hourly wage cost in American industry runs just over $16 per 
hour, the same hour costs a German employer about $23. The prime cause of this 
differential is the employer-paid welfare benefits package. 
</P>
<P>
 In Belgium, for example, industrial employers pay an average of $10 per hour 
just for fringe benefits. In the United States, the figure is $4. This 
additional drag is often cited as one key reason western Europe has managed to 
generate only a quarter as many new jobs as the United States has since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall of the Iron Curtain -- and the emergence of new industrial 
democracies in former Soviet Bloc countries as strong, low-wage competitors in 
low- and medium-technology industries -- has merely intensified the effect of 
western Europe's high wages and the export of jobs that inevitably results. 
</P>
<P>
 "Production costs too high, too much unemployment, too rigid structures -- is 
Germany breaking apart as a an industrial location?" the leading news weekly, 
Der Spiegel, asked at the turn of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Europeans certainly understand the logic of the disincentives built 
into their systems, two major factors make any radical changes unlikely. First, 
the welfare systems have become a part of the region's identity and are widely 
viewed as a social good that must not be sacrificed. Second, trade unions -- 
far stronger in Europe than in the United States -- consider themselves the 
ultimate guardians of the welfare state and have shown they are prepared to 
defend it. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of starting to bargain benefits for jobs under the pressure of record 
unemployment, organized labor in Europe has gone to the barricades to defend 
the existing system. 
</P>
<P>
 Cautious trims to welfare benefits have brought general strikes in Spain and 
Belgium and angry protests elsewhere. In France, such tension has frightened 
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur away from doing much more than tinkering to cut 
his country's 12% jobless rate. 
</P>
<P>
 But a deal worked out last November between unions and management at Europe's 
largest auto maker, Volkswagen, seemed to indicate the European public may be 
ready to accept a lower standard of living and share what work there is before 
it would sacrifice social benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Volkswagen's work force voted to accept a four-day week and a 20% pay cut 
rather than see the company shed 31,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequently, the Bonn government has introduced legislation aimed at 
promoting part-time work as a way of job-sharing. And the national metalworkers 
union reached a pact with employers that cuts the work week to 30 hours from 36 
to save jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a great number of people who really would like to shift to 
part-time work," noted Juergen Schupp, an economist at the German Institute for 
Economic Research in Berlin. "But the government has to make it attractive by 
making sure those who do don't lose their benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 Times researcher Isabel Maelcamp in Brussels contributed to this report.

CELLULAR PACT MAY NOT TRIGGER BUY-U.S. SPREE; TRADE: JAPANESE ARE UNLIKELY TO 
RALLY AROUND AMERICAN PRODUCTS EVEN IF THEY ARE SIGNIFICANTLY CHEAPER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The United States and Japan may have forged an agreement that will intensify 
competition in cellular communications along the crowded Tokyo-Nagoya corridor. 
But Americans shouldn't expect a big "thank you" from Japanese consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest trade dust-up between the two nations, it is Motorola and 
America that are the targets of Japanese wrath, not the companies that have 
been charging consumers rates four to five times those in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Re-Emergence of Prewar Economic Blockade," and "Down With Coercive U.S. 
Diplomacy" were among the anti-American graffiti sprayed on the walls of 
Motorola's headquarters in downtown Tokyo earlier this month after America 
threatened to impose trade sanctions on Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the White House threatened sanctions, "all of us have come to hate 
America," said journalist Toshiaki Ohno of other Japanese reporters covering 
telecommunications. "The role of Japanese consumers isn't to boost profits at 
American companies." 
</P>
<P>
 The intensity of Japan's response to American pressure is a symptom of the 
economic nationalism that bubbles up a little more fiercely here each time 
there is a trade dispute between the two economic powers. It also underscores 
the depth of the gulf that divides Japan from the West on just what constitutes 
free trade and what Japan must do to open its economy. The agreement reached 
between the United States and Japan Saturday allows Motorola Inc. to compete on 
equal footing with Japanese companies in providing cellular phone service in 
the heavily populated region stretching from Tokyo to Nagoya. Motorola had 
maintained that its local partner, Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. (IDO), had 
thwarted sales in the coveted, 155-mile corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, an outbreak of American-style competition among cellular companies in 
Japan seems unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 Delays already have provided Japanese suppliers with the crucial lead time 
necessary to bring their costs in line with Motorola's. And by the time IDO's 
Motorola network covers most of Tokyo 18 months from now, it will face 
additional competition from new companies offering digital services -- some of 
them beneficiaries of a new Japanese government low-interest loan program. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the Japanese government is taking steps to prevent cellular 
phone prices from falling too rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 And Japanese consumers are not ready to fight for lower prices if it means 
that increased competition will damage Japanese firms that employ family 
members and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The attitude of Tokyo businessman Asahio Goto is typical. "We Japanese are 
sympathetic to NTT (the national telephone monopoly) because they have so many 
employees they have to support," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he would use a cellular phone if prices fell, Goto is stoic about doing 
without the luxury: "I make do with a pager." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the unchanging nature of Japanese institutions and attitudes through 
Japan's long effort to catch up with the West, some experts doubt the cellular 
phone pact will change the Japanese marketplace very much. Japan expert 
Chalmers Johnson sees such concessions by the Japanese less as progress toward 
an open market than as a "smoke screen to buy time," doing little to change the 
ways of the Japanese economy. 
</P>
<P>
 America's hopes for genuine change in Japanese trade practices arose from the 
fall last July of the Liberal Democratic Party, one of the three sides of the 
iron triangle that has ruled the country for three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two other powers -- industry and bureaucracy -- have remained as an 
even more powerful iron axis that continues to favor industry interests over 
those of consumers and local producers over foreign producers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the bureaucrats who were up late trying to find ways to appease 
Motorola's demands. And it is the bureaucrats who will move the levers of the 
economy to try and lower Japan's attention-getting trade surpluses. That won't 
necessarily mean more American imports. One likely solution: shift the 
surpluses to Asia, countries by assembling more products in Southeast Asia and 
China for re-export to America and the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 When Japan began offering cellular phone service 14 years ago, it was 
bureaucrats in the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MPT) who required 
that all phones be leased, enabling service providers to set high prices for 
phone rentals. Today, while American cellular providers subsidize the sale of 
phones to encourage their use -- allowing stores to sell them for as little as 
$50 -- Japanese companies rent the phones for $80 a month and more. Until 
recently, NTT even required consumers to pay a $952 deposit for each phone 
rented. 
</P>
<P>
 During Japan's economic bubble in the late 1980s, cellular sales grew in spite 
of the high cost. Image was everything, and there was nothing quite as striking 
as being seen using a cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
 When the economy dipped in 1991, however, so too did growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure from America and from reformers within Japan, the MPT agreed 
two years ago to allow cellular phones to be purchased as of April 1, 1994. At 
the same time, two new cellular phone carriers will be allowed to enter each 
market with new, digital technology that makes more efficient use of radio 
waves than the Motorola-IDO analog system. 
</P>
<P>
 In anticipation of the new competition, NTT dropped its deposit requirement in 
October, and cellular phone carriers began cutting their prices. Lower prices 
immediately drove cellular phone subscriptions up 200%, triggering a wave of 
anxiety among Japan's cellular firms about "prosperity without profit." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the Japanese government has taken steps to stabilize prices. When a 
company part owned by Pacific Telesis recently discounted some rates, MPT 
scolded the firm for acting in a way that might "demoralize" other dealers. 
Taihei Kurose, an official in MPT's Mobile Telecommunications division, said 
the agency acted to avoid "market confusion." 
</P>
<P>
 Explains Phua Lee Kerk, senior analyst at Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd.: 
"Since they have been a protected market, cellular phones are one of the few 
areas that have been generating cash. At U.S. price levels, the Japanese 
companies can't survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the agreement between Tokyo and Washington, Motorola has cause to be 
suspicious of its Japanese partner. 
</P>
<P>
 IDO is a consortium of such establishment-style companies as Toyota, Tokyo 
Electric and NEC. When it first began competing with NTT more than a decade ago 
in providing cellular service, IDO chose to use NTT technology rather than 
Motorola's, a decision attributed to the influence of Japan's old boy network. 
</P>
<P>
 "Toyota is the largest shareholder of IDO. They can't go against NTT or it 
will start buying more of their cars from Nissan," said analyst Kerk. 
</P>
<P>
 IDO later agreed to introduce Motorola technology, under pressure from the 
United States. Less aggressive and less successful than its counterpart in 
eastern Japan, the IDO system covers less than half of the Tokyo-Nagoya market. 
Consequently, Motorola has sold only 12,000 phones in the region. The new trade 
pact allows low-cost Motorola to more than triple its capacity in Japan to 
450,000 subscribers from about 150,000.  
</P>
<P>
 As Motorola moves to achieve that goal, it undoubtedly will encounter 
competition from upstart Japanese equipment-makers funded with special 
low-interest loans designed to encourage domestic production of cellular 
phones. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, for example, the MPT initiated a program that would allow any 
company investing in cellular phone production facilities to borrow up to 40% 
of the investment costs from the Japan Development Bank, a quasi-government 
institution, at interest rates as low as 3.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Although government officials are periodically introducing new measures they 
say will stimulate the economy and boost imports, measures such as these could 
have the effect of discouraging imports. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, many of the cellular phones Japanese companies sell overseas are 
made in America using American components. The MPT said it wants to encourage 
Japanese manufacturers to take advantage of recent market liberalization to 
boost production. An official said Japanese subsidiaries of American companies 
would have access to the loans if they were willing to set up manufacturing 
facilities in Japan.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: HOME BUILDER TRYING TO TURN SALES INTO PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For three years, the depressed California housing market has been driving 
builders away -- and driving them under. 
</P>
<P>
 All the while, Los Angeles-based Kaufman & Broad Home has used the misfortune 
of the majority to engineer a stunning market-share heist. 
</P>
<P>
 K&B, the state's biggest and most aggressive builder, accounted for eight of 
every 100 new single-family homes sold in California last year, up from just 
two out of every 100 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 By focusing on the once-ignored first-time buyer, K&B delivered a record 5,745 
homes in California in 1993, up 46% from 3,944 in '92. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, K&B Chief Executive Bruce Karatz is trying to turn his market-share 
victory into an earnings triumph as well. After sacrificing significant 
profitability to snare buyers at other builders' expense, Karatz is trying to 
push through the company's first substantial price increase on new homes in 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the planned 3% average price hike -- an attempt by K&B to boost margins 
and thus reward patient shareholders, whose stock price has been stalled since 
1992 -- comes at a time when competition in the California housing market has 
again begun to blossom. 
</P>
<P>
 An increasing number of builders from outside California are crossing the 
border to hunt for land. While the conventional wisdom is that Southern 
California in particular remains a severely depressed economy, many outsiders 
no longer see it that way: 
</P>
<P>
 * Del Webb Corp. of Phoenix, which until now built only retirement communities 
in the Southland, announced last month that it has teamed with Costa Mesa-based 
Meeker Cos. to pursue non-retirement housing in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the time is right to get into Southern California," says Ken 
Plonski, a Webb spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dallas-based Centex Corp., the nation's largest builder, last month outbid 
K&B for a choice parcel of 915 lots in the Foothill Ranch development of Orange 
County. Reported price: $45 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Toll Bros., an East Coast builder, has come West for the first time with a 
December land purchase in Yorba Linda. Another big Eastern builder, Hovnanian 
Enterprises, is rumored to be searching for Southland sites. 
</P>
<P>
 More important to K&B, many California builders that had targeted the move-up 
market of more expensive homes are now shifting their focus to lower-priced 
homes (usually under $200,000) for first-time buyers -- K&B's bread and butter 
since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Castle & Cooke Homes, for example, is downscaling to accommodate more 
first-time buyers in Bakersfield, where it dominates the market. And Columbia, 
Md.-based Ryland Group, which builds under the Brock and Larchmont names in 
California, announced in mid-January that it will focus almost entirely on 
entry-level buyers from now on, instead of its traditional move-up market. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryland, the nation's fourth-largest home builder overall, could pose a 
particularly interesting threat to K&B long term. In November, K&B's chief 
financial officer and executive vice president, R. Chad Dreier, stunned Karatz 
and the building industry by leaving K&B to take over as Ryland's chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 While Dreier says that Karatz wished him well, Wall Streeters say Dreier's 
abrupt departure was a blow to the 48-year-old Karatz. Dreier, 46, had worked 
for Karatz for eight years and was second in command at K&B. Dreier says it was 
a difficult decision, but that the CEO post at Ryland was an opportunity he 
couldn't pass up. 
</P>
<P>
 If his departure was a shocker, analysts say Dreier's decision to refocus 
Ryland on the entry-level home market in California was no surprise at all, 
given K&B's dramatic success in that market since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what Dreier's going to do is create 'K&B Jr.' at Ryland," says Ira 
Norris, chief executive of Inco Homes, one of K&B's main competitors in the 
entry-level market in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 What puzzles some analysts is why it has taken so long for K&B's rivals to see 
the potential in the first-time buyer market. 
</P>
<P>
 Karatz is credited with recognizing in 1989 that the California housing market 
was turning and that disaster loomed for builders of high-priced move-up homes. 
And indeed, as the state economy sank, move-up purchases dwindled. Prices 
collapsed, and many builders stuck with high-priced inventory ended up in 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 K&B was hurt in the price plunge; earnings tumbled from $2.44 a share in 1989 
to 78 cents a share in 1992, dragged down not only by California but by K&B's 
large commercial and residential construction business in France, its other 
principal market. 
</P>
<P>
 But by heavily gearing its new developments in California toward first-time 
buyers, K&B found a huge market of frustrated renters waiting to be served. 
</P>
<P>
 K&B's average selling price in California was $163,100 last year, down from 
$196,200 in 1990. In that same time frame, the number of K&B homes delivered in 
California rocketed to 5,745 from 3,026. Three out of four K&B customers last 
year were first-time buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers make K&B's transition look simple, but it wasn't. Designing and 
marketing affordable single-family housing, especially in California, is no 
simple feat, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Karatz repositioned everything about the company," says Steve Johnson, 
partner at the Meyers Group, a real estate consulting firm in Corona. 
</P>
<P>
 To cut prices, K&B had to control expenses far more tightly than it ever had. 
On that count, analysts say Karatz and Dreier may have surprised even 
themselves. Using centralized purchasing for its far-flung developments, K&B 
held construction costs to a 12% increase last year, below the company's 14% 
rise in construction revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "K&B has been extremely aggressive on costs, and the results have been very 
impressive," admits Steven R. Muller, who heads rival Centex's West Coast arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts also believe K&B has lowered its cost structure without harming the 
quality of its homes. The company says its sales numbers speak for themselves. 
In entry-level housing, "they make a silk purse out of a sow's ear," marvels 
Burland East, a real estate industry analyst at Kemper Securities in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Wall Street has been pressuring K&B to do more for its bottom line. 
Despite its sales volume in California, the company's profit margins on its 
entry-level homes haven't thrilled investors. While earnings rose 23% last 
year, to 96 cents a share, analysts' consensus 1994 estimate of $1.78 a share 
is predicated in part on better margins. 
</P>
<P>
 That means price increases. In recent weeks, Karatz has called together his 
division chiefs and laid out plans for price hikes of 1% to 5%, averaging 3%, 
on K&B's California homes. Karatz admits that he faces opposition from some of 
his people, who fear jeopardizing K&B's market-share juggernaut. 
</P>
<P>
 Karatz agrees that California remains a market where "we have to offer more 
house for less money." But he also says, "We still ought to be getting higher 
margins" for shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 The question now is whether K&B's price increases can stick, especially as 
competition increases -- and as mortgage rates rise, threatening the other side 
of the affordability equation. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Allen, housing analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities in 
New York, argues that the time is right for a K&B price hike. She believes that 
a price increase by the state's largest builder will send a message that the 
market has finally bottomed. Psychologically, that's good for everybody, she 
contends. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people become aware that prices are going up instead of the other way, you 
get a more confident consumer overall," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the flurry of recent land purchases by outside builders, Allen 
doubts that California is in danger of becoming overbuilt again anytime soon. 
"The builders coming in now are just replacing those who have disappeared" in 
the recession, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Karatz, while never condescending toward his competition, says the rising 
number of builders targeting California "just tells me that the new-housing 
market here isn't as dead as some people thought." Even the Northridge 
earthquake, severe as it was, hasn't deterred buyers this year, he says. (In 
fact, some analysts believe the quake may be encouraging home purchases by 
renters who would rather be living in something that passes the most up-to-date 
construction standards.) 
</P>
<P>
 For K&B investors, the important issue is how much potential is left in the 
stock, which at $22.625 is no higher than it was two years ago. The price is 
only 13 times estimated 1994 earnings per share (versus 16 times earnings for 
the average blue-chip stock), but builders' stocks traditionally trade for low 
multiples because of the cyclical nature of the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen believes K&B's annual earnings could top $4 a share in the current 
housing cycle, with the peak occurring perhaps in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 If that estimate is on target, she says, the stock could reach $40 -- about 
double today's price. 
</P>
<P>
 But that will require a recovery in K&B's still-depressed French operations, 
which lost money last year for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 And K&B will also have to succeed in the new markets that it began targeting 
last year: Essentially following fleeing Californians, K&B has begun building 
homes in Las Vegas, Phoenix and Denver. The firm also has launched a 
development in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts see all of those ventures, while still small, as natural extensions 
of K&B's success formula in California. For the time being, however, K&B's 
fortunes will depend almost exclusively on the continued willingness of 
California's renters to take that first big plunge into homeownership. 
</P>
<P>
 Karatz, while unwilling to give earnings forecasts for K&B, has as much 
incentive as anyone to beat Wall Street's numbers: Including options, he owns 
1.22 million K&B shares, or 4.1% of the total outstanding. How the Builders 
Stack Up

<P>
 Kaufman & Broad Home Corp., California's largest home builder, posted a sharp 
rebound in earnings last year, helped by record sales in the Golden State -- 
despite the Southland economy's deep recession. But the company's challenge now 
is to restore results to peak levels of 1989, Wall Street analysts say. K & B 
Shareholders: Still Waiting 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman and Broad's stock has zoomed from its lowest levels of 1990, but 
recently, as investors have turned cautious, the price hasn't traded much above 
the peak levels of 1992.

FOOTNOTES / JAMES BATES: THIRSTY FOR WATERGATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The controversy surrounding the Whitewater financial affair has been a fiasco 
so far for President Clinton's Administration, but at least it has helped Yorba 
Linda's tourism business. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Cartwright, assistant director at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace 
there, says that the number of visitors to the museum has surged about 20% this 
month, which he attributes directly to a Whitewater-inspired curiosity about 
the Watergate scandal that led to Nixon's resignation nearly 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Cartwright believes that the frequent comparisons to Watergate that the press 
is making have inspired people to check out the museum's Watergate exhibit, the 
largest of the museum's 22 exhibit areas. Older people are refreshing their 
memories, he said, while many younger people are studying Watergate in detail 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially popular, Cartwright notes, is an exhibit in which Nixon on tape 
fields some questions about the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 In one response, Nixon quotes Winston Churchill as saying "great leaders do 
the big things well but they tend to stumble on the little things . . . in this 
case, a little thing became a big thing and of course destroyed us." Sole Man 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount Communications takeover winner Sumner Redstone no doubt hopes he 
won't lose his shirt as a result of the $12-billion acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 He almost lost a shoe already. 
</P>
<P>
 In a talk last week to film exhibitors in Las Vegas, the Viacom chief told how 
one of his shoes slipped off his foot in a deep New York City snow bank the 
night last month when he was waiting for shareholders to decide between his bid 
and the rival one by QVC Inc.'s Barry Diller. 
</P>
<P>
 Redstone said passersby hunted through the snow bank while he stood by in the 
cold. One man went into a store to get a shovel, he said, and found it. 
</P>
<P>
 Redstone said that when he asked the stranger what he could do for him the man 
replied: "Nothing. I just want you to be healthy when you win Paramount 
tomorrow." Something for Everyone 
</P>
<P>
 Now there's a catalogue to help you sort out even the obscure catalogues being 
published. 
</P>
<P>
 Catalogues featured in "The Best Catalogs in the World" include a "Northern 
Sun" catalogue that sells politically correct items, a catalogue with more than 
200 kinds of playing cards, a catalogue of dragon sculptures and another 
showing T-shirts, tableware and other items featuring pictures of cows. Briefly 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Help wanted: Auditions are scheduled for Wednesday for "Super Strawberry, the 
1994 California Strawberry Festival Official Mascot." . . . Metropolis magazine 
includes a postcard in its issues encouraging readers to "recycle this card" by 
sending it back with a subscription order. . . . American Demographics magazine 
says Americans are skeptical of "green" products, with only 30% believing ads 
claiming a product is better for the environment than a competitors' brand.

 Euro Disney Predicts Loss for Year: The trouble-plagued giant theme park 
outside Paris expects to report the loss even if a plan to restructure its 
$3.67-billion debt is approved by creditors and its parent, Walt Disney Co. In 
the company's annual report, Chairman Philippe Bourguignon said a debt 
restructuring could not be put in place in time to significantly cut interest 
costs in fiscal 1994, which ends Sept. 30. Euro Disney -- the entertainment 
conglomerate's effort to bring Mickey Mouse to the children of Europe -- has 
had to endure disappointing attendance, blamed in part on the lingering 
recession in Europe.

 Glenfed Mulls Asset Sale: The holding company for troubled Glendale Federal 
Bank said it hired investment banker CS First Boston to develop a restructuring 
plan that may involve selling unspecified assets, including branches or loans. 
Losses of $59.7 million over the six months ended Dec. 31 reduced Glenfed's 
capital to a level just $29 million above regulatory limits. Glenfed said it 
does not expect to sell stock or float bonds to raise the capital.

HOTEL DEVELOPERS BET ON MIAMI GAMBLING VOTE; CASINOS: WITH FOUR GAMING 
INITIATIVES ON THE FLORIDA BALLOT, BIG-NAME INVESTORS ARE LINING UP FOR A PIECE 
OF THE ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who could resist? 
</P>
<P>
 The city offers $60 million in incentives to build an oceanfront, 
convention-size hotel, and there is rampant talk of legalizing casino gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 Intrigued by prospects of building the first big hotel on Miami Beach in 26 
years, the Ritz Carlton, Hyatt, Loews, Peabody and Marriott chains are jostling 
for prime property bordering the ultra-trendy Art Deco district. Big-name 
investors in bids opened last week include Ross Perot and CBS Chairman Laurence 
Tisch. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel proposals -- plans range from 756 to 900 rooms -- buttress the 
city's belief that the area along the southern end of Miami Beach is thriving 
after years as a decaying front-porch perch for senior citizens in residential 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 "This hotel works with or without gaming, and certainly we would proceed in 
any environment," said Jonathan Tisch, president of Loews Hotels and nephew of 
the CBS chief. "There are demand generators that will keep Miami Beach busy." 
</P>
<P>
 The new vitality is easy to see. 
</P>
<P>
 Aging hotels once relinquished to rats are now sporting fresh pastel paint and 
neon, neighborhoods have been spruced up, and roller-bladers whiz past 
fashionable cafes. 
</P>
<P>
 And then the unknown quantity -- gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 Casino operations are banned by the Florida Constitution unless a majority of 
voters agree to a change. Four competing ideas are afloat to put the issue on 
the ballot this November. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Sessions, executive director of the Proposition for Limited Casinos, 
believes the state is ripe for change even though two previous repeal attempts 
failed, the latest in 1986 by a 2-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Early polling and surveying have told us that a lot of the attitudes in 
Florida have changed," Sessions said. "The economic climate has changed 
dramatically as well. You've got casino operations springing up all over the 
Southeast." 
</P>
<P>
 Gambling on Indian reservations has spread to 27 states, card rooms are legal 
in 10, riverboats in six and casinos in five. 
</P>
<P>
 In Florida, another initiative, the Proposition for County Choice Gaming, 
would allow county voters to decide what forms of gambling they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that the market will take care of itself in the sense that there 
will only be a certain number that will be economically viable," said Michael 
Levine, chairman of the county choice plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But the market might already be crowded. 
</P>
<P>
 Casinos are as close as the cruise ships docking in five Florida cities or a 
short hop to the Bahamas. Meanwhile, parimutuel betting is available at 35 
horse tracks, dog tracks and jai alai frontons, and the state lottery is 6 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Dade County, which includes Miami and Miami Beach, is the only county to back 
casino gambling to date. Sessions' measure would recruit votes by allowing 
casinos at parimutuels, seven other casinos on land or water plus one 
guaranteed in Dade County. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami Beach is the odds-on locale, and the new hotel would be a beneficiary. A 
likely location is a parking lot across from the city's convention center and 
three blocks from the barren 5.5-acre hotel site. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever-enterprising developer Donald Trump also has a potential casino project 
in mind on a 35-acre parcel owned by German developer Thomas Kramer on Miami's 
South Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, there has been little opposition to the current drive for legalized 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 But one critic, Miami Beach Mayor Seymour Gelber, says a casino would wipe out 
the city's character by creating a "gambling factory."

 Premier Sets Modest Growth Target of 9%: Li Peng has set the cautious target 
for 1994, declaring that stability cannot be sacrificed for short-term economic 
gains.Rising inflation, economic bottlenecks and a flood of corruption washing 
across the country could undermine China's achievements and tip the country 
into turmoil, Li said. He said the 9% target for gross domestic product growth 
this year represents a reasonable slowing from the 13.4% China recorded in 1993 
and should prove to be a sustainable pace for several years. Inflation must be 
held below 10% and new investment strictly controlled to prevent another sudden 
expansion of credit, Li said.

VIETNAM REFUGEE FINDS NEW FUTURE IN HOMELAND; ASIA: AFTER LIVING FOR YEARS IN 
SOUTHLAND, HE RETURNS TO SET UP SHOP AS A BUSINESS CONSULTANT AND ORGANIZE 
COUNTRY'S FIRST TRADE FAIR FOR U.S. FIRMS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After fleeing his homeland in a fishing boat, Giang Tran prospered as a real 
estate developer, studied to become a lawyer and wrote two books. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old Vietnamese-American drove a BMW, lived in a posh condo in 
Santa Ana and flew from Los Angeles to San Francisco just for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't a millionaire, but I lived like a millionaire. Whatever I had, I 
spent," he said. Eventually, Tran lost interest in that lifestyle because, "I 
found no value in what I was doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, drawn by family ties and childhood memories, he returned to 
Vietnam, setting up shop as a business consultant. Now he's busy organizing the 
country's first trade fair for U.S. companies since the end of the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 As managing director of Vietnam Investment Information and Consulting, Tran 
also advises about 40 foreign firms about ventures in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not thinking about what is the latest suit from Georgio Armani," he said. 
"But I am thinking about how much it would cost to build, say, a 50-megawatt 
power plant." 
</P>
<P>
 Tran, a native of Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City, said he hopes to encourage 
some of the more than 2 million Vietnamese living overseas -- the Viet-kieu -- 
to return to help rebuild their impoverished homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of Viet-kieu are combing the country, seeking to broker deals 
between foreign investors and local companies, although only a handful are 
working as consultants for foreign firms, said Vo Xuan Tuong, an official at 
the government's Central Committee for Overseas Vietnamese. Overseas Vietnamese 
themselves have invested $64 million in about 40 ventures, according to Tuong. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hanoi government, recognizing that the Viet-kieu can play an important 
role in bringing badly needed capital and expertise, last year cut taxes they 
pay on profits transferred abroad to 5%, versus a 10% rate for other 
foreigners. Viet-kieu also are free of restrictions faced by others in buying 
shares of non-government Vietnamese banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran said the efforts of younger overseas Vietnamese are especially needed to 
heal the divisions between those who fled the country during and after the war 
and those who stayed behind. Divisions are something he knows well. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran's father, Tran Ngoc Chau, served as speaker of the national assembly of 
former South Vietnam before he was jailed in 1970 as a suspected communist, a 
charge Tran said was fabricated. 
</P>
<P>
 His uncle, Tran Ngoc Hien, was an intelligence officer for the North 
Vietnamese army during the war. Tran left a sister behind when he fled with his 
parents and four other brothers and sisters in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran and his family spent nine months in refugee camps in Malaysia and 
Indonesia before settling in Southern California's San Fernando Valley. He 
attended high school there, going on to attend Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 While in college, Tran started a real estate business in the 
Vietnamese-American community of Westminster. He gave the flourishing firm his 
full attention, even after beginning law school in 1986 at Western State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 He also found time to write a Vietnamese-language account of his experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "The book was a way to express my frustration with a very strange country that 
I found myself in, with strange people, but also with myself as a stranger, as 
a man looking for his identity," he said. He wrote a second book, about his 
yearnings for a new challenge, in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran interrupted law school in 1989 and returned to Vietnam to seek his roots. 
He looked up his sister, a doctor living in Ho Chi Minh City, but kept the trip 
secret -- even from his family -- to avoid causing an uproar in Southern 
California's fiercely anti-communist Vietnamese-American community. 
</P>
<P>
 Several trips later, he had abandoned his property business, formed Vietnam 
Investment Information and Consulting and pinned his hopes on a future closely 
tied to Vietnam. Last year, Tran and his Vietnamese wife moved to Hanoi, the 
country's 1,000-year-old capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The transition from life in California wasn't a problem, he said. "To me it's 
a normal thing. The big thing is if I can do what I want with integrity." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Tran often finds himself in situations where clients would be 
better served if he paid bribes to local officials. But he refuses to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I bribe, then I'm corrupted. I want to be an incorruptible man, in 
whatever I do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran, who intends eventually to resume his legal studies, doesn't know how 
long he'll live in Hanoi. The Vietnamese have treated him well so far, even as 
a southerner in the once hostile North. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he labors against two extreme opinions many local people have 
about Viet-kieu businessmen.  
</P>
<P>
 Many assume that he's either a billionaire or "an ex-convict, a cheating 
type." 
</P>
<P>
 "Facts will speak louder than words," Tran said. "After a few more years in 
Vietnam, and after what I've already done, I'll have their trust and 
confidence."

 Beijing Expects Large Deficit: China's finance minister has acknowledged a 
huge deficit for this year in his budget plan and said he is not sure how his 
figures will end up because of a major revamping of the financial and tax 
system.Liu Zhongli told the National People's Congress, or Parliament, that 
widespread tax evasion, misuse of funds, false reporting and the drastic 
overhaul of the tax system made it difficult to fulfill the budget targets. He 
said the 1994 budget will post a deficit of $7.69 billion under new accounting 
rules that bring Beijing into line with international practice. Under the old 
system, last year's actual deficit was $2.36 billion.

STRONG FUNDS SAYS SEC IS INVESTIGATING IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a second major blow to the mutual fund industry's image this year, the 
Milwaukee-based Strong Funds organization has confirmed that it is under 
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong told employees Friday that it is "cooperating with the SEC in an 
investigation relating to cross trades and disclosures between 1987 and early 
1990." 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC probe apparently focuses on securities trades made between Strong 
funds. While intra-company trades aren't illegal, the SEC sets down strict 
rules governing how fund companies must price and document the trades, so that 
a fund operator can't favor one fund at another's expense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wall Street Journal said the SEC is studying whether Strong dumped 
depressed junk bonds from some of its institutional funds into funds owned by 
small investors. But Richard Strong, the company's principal, told employees 
that "there has never been any allegation that trades were used to favor one 
account over another." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the fund industry's reputation was tarnished by news that 
Denver-based Invesco Funds fired one of its star managers for failing to report 
personal stock trades. The firing raised fears that fund managers may be 
trading for personal gain in advance of trades they make for their funds.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: 10 TIPS FOR MAKING THE MOST OF '93 TAX CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton's 1993 tax package had fairly little impact on people owning 
mutual funds. That's the good news. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is that there are still plenty of potentially confusing tax 
issues for people buying mutual funds these days. 
</P>
<P>
 The following 10 tips for the tax season can help point you in the right 
direction. Most rely more on common sense than numbers, since sound investment 
planning doesn't have to be overly quantitative. 
</P>
<P>
 1: The higher your income, the more municipal bond mutual funds may make 
sense. No earthshaking revelation here, just simple math. 
</P>
<P>
 An untaxed 5% yield, typical of what's being paid by muni bond funds today, is 
equivalent to 8.3% on a competing investment for a person who pays taxes at the 
top federal rate of 39.6%. But the same 5% yield translates to only 5.9% 
taxable for someone in the 15% bracket. 
</P>
<P>
 2: The higher your income, the more stock funds may make sense. Perhaps the 
biggest investment impact of Clinton's tax package was that it raised the top 
levy on dividend income to 39.6%, while keeping the maximum capital gains tax 
rate at 28%. 
</P>
<P>
 This gives wealthier investors a good reason to switch to 
appreciation-oriented stock funds over yield-oriented bond products. 
</P>
<P>
 3: Tax-sheltered retirement plans are worth using. Employer-provided programs 
that allow worker contributions, such as a 401(k) and 403(b), and equivalent 
plans for self-employed people can be great ways to build wealth. They allow 
tax-deferred growth and reduce your taxable income by the amount you invest. 
Plus, your company might make a matching investment on your behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 If you and your spouse don't have retirement coverage at work, you can still 
get tax-deferred growth and a deduction of up to $2,000 each by investing 
through an individual retirement account. And even with coverage at work, you 
may still qualify for a full or partial IRA deduction, depending on your 
income. 
</P>
<P>
 4: Variable annuities can make sense if you have additional investment dollars 
to shelter. These close cousins to mutual funds offer several nice features, 
including a means of sheltering investment earnings from taxes until the money 
is withdrawn. Plus, there's no limit on how much you can invest in annuities, 
unlike with IRAs and work-related retirement plans. 
</P>
<P>
 However, annuities don't offer deductions or matching provisions. Regard them 
as your third choice in the retirement planning hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 5: The more muni bond funds you own, the more likely you are to have taxable 
gains to report. Only the yields paid by these funds skirt taxes. Any profits 
resulting from appreciating bond prices are taxable. On average, "tax-free" 
funds returned about 11.3% in 1993, of which only about half was exempt 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 6: The more IRAs you own, the more you should consider fund companies that 
offer no-fee IRA programs. Those $10 to $15 yearly fees -- more at some 
full-service brokerages -- add up with multiple accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 7: The more worried you are about taxes, the less stock fund investing you 
should do in December. That's the month stock funds generally pass their 
taxable profits on to shareholders for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 If you invest shortly before a capital gains declaration, you would buy a 
piece of the tax liability earned during the year, though you didn't share in 
the profits. But when you ultimately sell your stake, you would essentially 
recoup the money. This caveat wouldn't apply if you were investing within 
tax-sheltered accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 8: The more you use dollar-cost averaging, the more record keeping you can 
expect. 
</P>
<P>
 With an averaging strategy, you invest a fixed amount regularly -- say $100 a 
month -- into the fund of your choice. While great for easing into risky stock 
funds, the approach can be mildly complicated for record keeping purposes 
because each purchase is a taxable transaction (assuming your account isn't 
sheltered). 
</P>
<P>
 9: The less selling you do, the less you need to worry about the three main 
methods for calculating gains and losses on fund shares -- "specific 
identification," "first-in, first-out" and "average cost." 
</P>
<P>
 Each will result in a different taxable gain or loss assuming you sell a 
portion of your shares. If you sell all shares, the tax result will be the same 
regardless of which approach you take. Many fund companies offer pamphlets 
describing the various methods in detail. 
</P>
<P>
 10: The more you reinvest capital gains distributions and dividends, the 
better records you should keep. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule here is fairly simple: When you reinvest dividends and capital gains 
distributions in additional shares, you must pay taxes on these amounts -- just 
as if you had received them in cash. But when you ultimately sell your shares, 
you can narrow the resulting taxable gain (or widen the loss) to reflect the 
amounts reinvested over the years. Again, this assumes your investment is not 
in a sheltered account. 
</P>

<P>
 The mutual fund division of San Francisco-based Wells Fargo Bank today is 
unveiling an unusual array of funds designed for investors in five different 
stages of life. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Stagecoach LifePath portfolios will diversify among up to eight stock 
and five bond categories, along with a money market component. The funds will 
invest in indexes rather than individual securities, as the emphasis is on 
active asset allocation. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the LifePath 2000 fund, designed for people expecting to retire 
or withdraw cash around the year 2000, will generally have a weighting of about 
20% in stocks, 70% in bonds and 10% in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other extreme, LifePath 2040, the most aggressive of the bunch, will 
tend to stay nearly entirely in stocks. The other funds are geared for 
withdrawals in or around 2010, 2020 or 2030. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the funds are focused for the long haul, LifePath managers can change 
the asset mix as frequently as daily, depending on management's reaction to 
market conditions. Over the years, however, each fund's allocation will tend to 
grow more conservative, mirroring shareholders' perceived need for greater 
income and stability. 
</P>
<P>
 When the target year arrives, the funds won't liquidate but will maintain a 
conservative posture.

ANN CONWAY: SHIELDING CHILDREN; BROOKE LENDS HER SUPPORT FOR OLIVE CREST 
FOUNDATION AT NEWPORT BEACH GALA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Anybody who thought Brooke Shields would sweep into Le Meridien Hotel in a 
cloud of greasepaint, baubles and chiffon got a surprise on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The actress/cover girl wore little makeup, her signet ring from Princeton and 
a simple black jumpsuit to the Black and White Ball in Newport Beach that 
benefited the Olive Crest Abused Children's Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 And she walked with a cane. "I just had foot surgery," she confided. "They had 
to break and readjust some of the bones in my feet or I would have had chronic 
bunions." 
</P>
<P>
 Shields, 28, came from the East Coast to help fight child abuse because both 
she and her boyfriend, tennis ace Andre Agassi (who did not attend) are child 
advocates. In fact, Shields and Agassi posed for the current cover of a 
national tabloid because "it benefited a cause for children," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I care very much about abused children. We really need to make people more 
aware of the gravity of the situation," she said. "This event for Olive Crest 
is a great way to highlight what can be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Before her arrival at the black-tie gala, the star of "Pretty Baby" and "Blue 
Lagoon" sat with her mom, Teri Shields, and her godfather, Hank Snyder of Costa 
Mesa -- her driver and bodyguard -- in the Lincoln Town Car that ferried her to 
the event. (Patiently, she waited for event volunteer Robert King to book her a 
room so she could step out of her sweats and tennies.) 
</P>
<P>
 With candor, she answered the inevitable questions: 
</P>
<P>
 How serious is it with Agassi (formerly Barbra Streisand's squeeze)? "We care 
very much about each other." Advised her mom: "Be patient, Brooke; make sure 
you're both happy." 
</P>
<P>
 How does she feel about the troubles of her pal Michael Jackson? "He is a good 
person. I think I have said all I can about him in the past." Added her mom: 
"He loves children." 
</P>
<P>
 Was it her first visit to Orange County? "I grew up coming here. Mother and I 
would come to visit Hank and we'd hang out at the flea markets. I still shop 
here at offbeat places. South Coast Plaza is great, but I have to disguise 
myself to shop there." 
</P>
<P>
 Will she attend the Academy Awards? "No, I'll be watching it on TV with my mom 
and Hank and a big bowl of popcorn." 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside the private VIP party that saluted gala donors, Shields walked 
carefully with the colorful cane she bought in Africa during the filming of her 
new flick, "Running Wild," with Martin Sheen. "I collect canes," she said. "I 
never dreamed I would be using one." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, before guests could say "May I have your autograph?" she was whisked 
into the ballroom for a photo session with Olive Crest benefactors, who 
included American Savings Chairman Mario Antoci. "He can't wait to get his 
picture taken with Brooke Shields," said his wife, Diane Antoci, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 While hundreds of flashbulbs exploded, Shields stood there, calmly, ever the 
good sport, flashing her huge baby-blues at the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Also getting the attention of the paparazzi was comedian Cindy Williams, who 
emceed the event with actor Perry King. "I'm here because I'm a child 
advocate," she explained. "All people have to do today to understand the scope 
of child abuse is watch television. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people are asking 'what can I do to help?' the answer is, 'support 
projects like Olive Crest.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Olive Crest, a network of treatment and care facilities in Orange, Los 
Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside and San Diego counties, was founded in 1973 
by Don Verleur, a psychologist, and his wife, Lois. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we'd just do a little project with four young girls who were 
incest victims," said Don Verleur, who lives in Orange. "We provided them with 
a home and extended family." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Olive Crest has provided more than 7,000 abused, abandoned and 
neglected children with a safe and loving environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Gala festivities included a sit-down feast of filet mignon and breast of 
chicken taken at tables decorated with film reels and floral bouquets. The 
event's theme, "Spotlight on Our Stars," saluted the children and volunteers of 
Olive Crest. 
</P>
<P>
 Receiving awards for service were Bill Gibson, Helen Viviano, Jan Adams, Carol 
Munaretto, Sue Duckor, David Wensley, JoEtta Brown and Maurice Sanchez. Other 
winners were John Angeli, Jim Burton, Margo Bender, Susan Jelinek, Sylvia 
Burnett, Betty Belden-Palmer and Jim Paulus. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Grassie Hall and Kathy McClister were gala co-chairwomen. Also among 
guests were Darrel Anderson, chairman of the Olive Crest board; Steve Charton, 
president of the Olive Crest Foundation in Orange County; Sue Pharris Tallman 
(who presented Olive Crest with a donation of $100,000 in honor of her parents, 
C.L. and Genevieve Pharris); and Mary and Peter Muth.

JACK SMITH: WE'RE SIMPLY PAYING THE PRICE FOR ONE BAD MOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 My wife and I were driving north on the Pasadena Freeway the other morning and 
it suddenly came to me why we live in Southern California -- or, specifically, 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 It was February. It was a gorgeous day. The blue-denim peaks of the San 
Gabriel Mountains were shadowed by luminous white cumulous clouds. The car's 
sunroof was open and the wind was brisk and clean. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway, Los Angeles' oldest, was undamaged in the earthquake. It was 
uncrowded. We felt as if we owned the road. God knows parts of the city were 
left in shambles, but it was possible to ignore them. 
</P>
<P>
 I remembered an earthquake of several years ago. There was severe damage in 
spots, but the city was not, as the eastern press exclaimed, in ruins. 
Photographers could find few sights to validate their papers' reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The Associated Press sent one of its top reporters, Saul Pett, to Los Angeles 
from New York to document the disaster. Finding no widespread calamity to 
describe, he decided to write, instead, a think piece on why, with our 
landslides, fires, riots and quakes, we Angelenos continue to live here. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking answers from residents, he called me. "Why does anybody live here?" he 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saul," I said, "where are you?"  
</P>
<P>
 "In the Beverly Hilton."  
</P>
<P>
 "Well, stick your head out the window and tell yourself it's February." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Beverly Hilton is air-conditioned. The windows don't open. But 
I think he got the point. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been some speculation on God's role in the earthquake. Some 
religious leaders have assured us that God is not concerned with such regional 
disasters. If, on the other hand, God is indeed omnipotent, then he is surely 
responsible for every shake. Unlike fires, earthquakes are not caused by human 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 My theory about the reason for the floods, hurricanes, fires, riots and 
earthquakes that have been visited on our country in recent months is simple: 
God has the gout. He's in a bad mood and is just lashing out to ease his 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 On the beautiful day we headed out the Pasadena Freeway, we met some friends 
for an 8 o'clock breakfast at Julianne's restaurant in San Marino, sitting next 
to the open patio. I wore an Orlon turtleneck and a jacket and was too warm.  
</P>
<P>
 We are remodeling again. This time my wife is redoing her bathroom and the 
kitchen. Also we are repainting my bathroom and the two bedrooms. The painters 
had left all the outside doors wide open to let fresh air blow away the paint 
fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 That's another reason we live in Los Angeles. We can leave our doors and 
windows open in February.  
</P>
<P>
 There has to be a deeper reason, though, other than the balmy temperatures, 
for our continued residence in Los Angeles. I think it has something to do with 
our view of life on this planet as it whirls through space. 
</P>
<P>
 We grow so smug in Southern California with our climate, our beaches, our 
mountains, our deserts and oases, our bikini-clad natives, our colleges and 
think tanks, our athletes and our movie stars. 
</P>
<P>
 We are accused by our critics of being hedonists inhabiting a place called La 
La Land. But our earthquakes come often enough to remind us that the earth, the 
very foundation of our lifestyle, is untrustworthy and is likely, at any 
minute, to shake us all to death. 
</P>
<P>
 That possibility gives us all a little thrill of danger and uncertainty that 
life in Southern California would otherwise lack. It reminds us that the good 
life is not guaranteed by God, and that he is likely to shatter our dreams and 
castles at any moment.  
</P>
<P>
 As I say, though, earthquakes have nothing to do with human misbehavior. We 
cannot say we are being punished. We are only being reminded that we must not 
be too laid-back. We must not take life's pleasures and amenities for granted. 
The earth may remind us at any moment of our precarious existence. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not hold, though, with those Christians who believe that in striking at 
our biggest playpen, the Coliseum, God was expressing his distaste for our 
games. Our sports are very humane compared to those that went on in the Roman 
Colosseum. 
</P>
<P>
 If I were to hold God responsible for human afflictions, I would surely blame 
him for the disasters visited on me during the past year -- two heart attacks, 
a stroke and the onset of Parkinson's disease. But I know in my heart that I 
have done nothing to deserve such afflictions. Or have I? 
</P>
<P>
 After all, an earthquake is not the end of the world, although we may fear 
that it is when one strikes. The thing to do is to recoup, rebuild and go back 
to work with a song in our hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 And pray that God gets over the gout.

KID STUFF; PARENTS TREAT BOYS, GIRLS DIFFERENTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Do parents treat girls and boys differently? Most parents acknowledge that 
they do, although many insist that boys demand it by acting differently than 
girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys, even the most liberated parents contend, tend to be physical, to fight 
and to prefer cars, trucks and other machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Fisher and Scott Davenport, a gay couple in Montclair, N.J., say they 
deliberately bought clothes in primary colors for Kati, 3, and Fritz, 18 
months. "Yet," says Fisher, executive director of the Gay and Lesbian Parents 
Coalition International, "first time Fritz saw a truck, he burst into smiles." 
</P>
<P>
 But others suggest that masculine and feminine cues are insidious, yet strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even in the color of the blanket at the hospital there is sex 
differentiation," says Evelyn Hausman Jakabovics, a psychologist in New 
Rochelle, N.Y. "Frequently, you have much more traditional roles being enforced 
than what people think they are doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Boys' rooms tend to contain more educational toys and sports equipment. A 
Tufts University study asked parents to describe their infants. Boys were rated 
firmer, bigger and more coordinated than they really were; girls came out 
softer and finer. 
</P>
<P>
 When boys fight, psychologist Ann Caron says, mothers will separate them. But 
with girls, they will talk about the other child's feelings. "We are constantly 
trying to make our daughters nicer."

A HISTORY OF YOUR SOCIAL LIFE -- FROM A TO Z; KEEPSAKES: THE ADDRESS BOOK IS 
BETTER THAN A DIARY, BETTER THAN A SCRAPBOOK. IT TRIGGERS MEMORIES, BUT SPARES 
ANYONE THE EMBARRASSMENT OF VIEWING THEIR SENIOR PROM PHOTO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG TOMASHOFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Life is a lot like a cross-country road trip: As you go along, you're always 
looking for signposts to show you're getting somewhere. The problem is finding 
a reliable indicator of where you are and how you got there. 
</P>
<P>
 You could try a diary, but who really has time to write in one, let alone go 
back and read about your crush on your ninth-grade math teacher? Photo albums 
are another option, but it's awfully embarrassing to see that lime-green 
leisure suit you wore for your senior picture. Parents might be helpful, but 
with any luck they don't know about the good stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves only one effective tool for putting your life into perspective. 
It's a document that reminds you who your friends are and triggers more fond 
memories than a year of looking at photo albums. It's your social history in 
printed form. It's the almighty address book. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's the bible," says George Shamma, a Los Angeles-based contractor 
who has more than 900 names in his. "I'll look through it sometimes and just 
reminisce. It's like a scrapbook of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Think about it. You wouldn't put somebody in there if you didn't like that 
person. If you had a pleasant childhood with lots of friends, there will be 
names in the book to reflect that. If your college years were the time you 
established lifelong bonds, it's in the book. Few belongings are more personal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I once had a friend who wanted a phone number that I had and he went into my 
book without asking," Shamma says. "He is no longer allowed in my house." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it's no coincidence that many people start an address book at about 
the same time they hit puberty. It's a sign of growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to do it when I turned 14, to imitate my parents, I guess," says John 
Horton, a San Francisco lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 It's usually not a formal book at that age, just some notebook paper with 
friends' phone numbers scribbled down. An official book, usually in the form of 
a Daytimer, comes when you reach adulthood and begin accumulating friends. At 
which point, you face the first of many key address book decisions: pen or 
pencil? 
</P>
<P>
 On one hand, pen implies permanence. This is a friend you're confident of, one 
who is going to stick with you for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always use a pen to make entries," Shamma says. "I can always shove more 
pages in my book. And I normally wouldn't even put somebody I'll deal with one 
or two times in there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, pencil may indicate a more temporary friendship, one that 
can be eliminated with one swipe of an eraser. But it can also just be a sign 
of a friend who moves too much to merit an inked address. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Hunt, a Los Angeles publicist, writes relatives in pen because 
"they're not going anywhere," but enters friends in pencil because "they're 
young, and they may move around a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Figuring out how to write people into your address book is critical, but it's 
still secondary in importance to determining who makes it in. The way you make 
that decision is another good indication of what sort of person you are. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, there are the collector types. Hunt has about 200 names in her 
book, including everyone from college pals to ex-boyfriends to friends of her 
family. Her standards for admission are pretty simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I talk to someone at their home and they talk to me at my home," she says. 
"And if I talk to that person at night or on a weekend, that constitutes a 
friendship." 
</P>
<P>
 As at a roach motel, though, most who check in to her address book never check 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there's always the chance I'll see somebody on the street and wish I had 
their number, or I'll be reading something funny and it will remind me of a 
college friend," Hunt says. Hence, her list has very little movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are those who are a little more demanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people initially go into my Rolodex," explains Lisa Desantis, a Los 
Angeles-based banker whose book has about 150 names. "You have to build up to 
the address book. It can take a good year to make it in." 
</P>
<P>
 Quality of time spent with someone, not just the quantity, have something to 
do with who you let in as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to know me long for your phone number to make it in," says 
Horton, whose book contains nearly 100 entries, about half of whom he just 
keeps a phone number for since they live locally. "There's a woman in here I've 
only been on three dates with. But if you make an impact, you get in. And old 
girlfriends tend to stay in even if we lose touch. It's a sentimental thing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There's also a fine line between business and personal entries. Hunt's address 
book is filled with the names and numbers of business contacts she might need 
over a weekend, and 700 of the 900 names in Shamma's are work-related. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more picky about who gets in on the friend side," he says. "I may add one 
name a month there, but sometimes in business I'm adding one or two people a 
day. I think I put more effort into searching (friendly entries) out." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting in is one thing. Getting booted out is quite another. It's the 
ultimate statement that you're making a change in your life, that you're in 
control of your destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the movie of my life," Shamma says. "I decide who gets in and who 
doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Seldom do you just fire somebody already cast in your picture. Rather, the 
real decision comes when it's time to get a new book. It's a chance to take 
stock of this list of people and determine who you can do without. There are 
plenty of reasons to have a falling-out with a friend, but generally there is 
only one good reason to let them fall out of your address book: You seem to 
have fallen out of theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I haven't talked to somebody in a year, they might be out," admits 
Desantis, although she hedges a bit by keeping her old address book in a 
drawer. Just in case. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can't get ahold of you four or five times in a row with the phone number 
or address I have, you're out," concurs Shamma. "I'm pretty arbitrary about it. 
And sometimes I'll end up seeing somebody I've dropped and I'll go up and tell 
them they're out. It's a good icebreaker." 
</P>
<P>
 It's no big deal. You've gone five years without writing to or hearing from a 
college roommate or ex-girlfriend, so it should be pretty painless to leave his 
or her name out of a new address book. That leaves all the more room to make 
new friends who will stay in touch. Still, because your book is like your 
permanent record, making a change is tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel guilty," Horton says. "You don't like to just drop people out of your 
lives like that. And on days when I'm feeling bad, I like to start with the A's 
and just look through the whole book to feel better."

THIS ISN'T ANOTHER FISH STORY; PEOPLE: A CARPINTERIA TEEN-AGER WAS SO IMPRESSED 
WITH THE BOOK 'TROUT FISHING IN AMERICA' THAT HE HAS LEGALLY TAKEN THE TITLE AS 
HIS MONIKER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The parents of a 17-year-old boy in Santa Barbara County grapple today with 
the realization that their son has, by God, tossed away his given name and 
henceforth shall be known, legally, as Trout Fishing in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Say it once. Say it twice. Oh, go ahead, say it three times. 
</P>
<P>
 Trout Fishing in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Yo, Trout? Excuse me, Mr. America? 
</P>
<P>
 The name is the title of a rather odd book. The young man read it. Liked it. 
Liked it a lot. Took it as his legal name early this month. 
</P>
<P>
 And so -- and we're just trying to help here -- perhaps the parents of the 
former Peter Eastman Jr. can find a tiny slice of solace in this thought: 
</P>
<P>
 If this notion had swept over their son at some other moment in his tour de 
literature, the kid's driver's license might say Moby Dick. 
</P>
<P>
 He is not, of course, Moby Dick. He is Trout Fishing in America. And if you 
delight in having a chill dash up your spine, chomp on this idea: Trout Fishing 
in America wants to be a pilot. He is close to getting his private license, 
setting up this possible scenario: 
</P>
<P>
 A 747 thunders across the sky, some 45,000 feet above the Earth. The intercom 
crackles to life. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is your pilot, Capt. 
Trout Fishing in America. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the announcement is drowned out, of course, as the passengers 
shriek madly and try to pry the plane's doors open. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Eastman never suffered a head injury. Never went any appreciable length 
of time without oxygen reaching his brain. The kid who changed his name to 
Trout Fishing in America -- you just can't say the name often enough, can you? 
-- is, as a matter of fact, quite intelligent. Especially when you stand him 
alongside today's average teen-ager, who, according to several studies that we 
are unable to locate right now, believes that the Whitewater scandal involves a 
river-rafting outfitter in Utah who didn't provide the required number of life 
jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 The saga of . . . may we call you Trout? . . . began two years ago. His 
father, Peter Eastman Sr., a lawyer in Santa Barbara, gave his son a copy of 
Richard Brautigan's 1967 counterculture classic, "Trout Fishing in America," a 
hellbent and, at times, dare we say, rambling collection of short stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Then-Peter was intrigued by Brautigan's off-balance look at the world. 
Example: In one of the stories, Brautigan is introduced to a person, talks 
briefly with him and then turns to leave with this parting line: "Excuse me. I 
thought you were a trout stream." 
</P>
<P>
 Whew. That's deep. Get it? Trout stream? Deep? You betcha it's funny. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, Peter the Former was intrigued. He found other Brautigan works. "In 
Watermelon Sugar" was another favorite. But he came back to "Trout Fishing in 
America" a few months ago. Read it again. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time, I started thinking about the name change," Trout said. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, he only wanted to use the name at his upcoming graduation from 
Carpinteria High School. The administration squelched that idea though, using 
the ridiculous argument that only a person's legal name can appear on the 
diploma. Something about opening the gate to a wave of teen-aged tomfoolery 
that would likely include at least nine attempts at slipping the name I.P. 
Freely into the graduation ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 So he got serious. He went for the legal name change. He says his parents gave 
their blessings. His father even signed the $182 check for legal fees, 
according to the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'OK. It's your choice,' " he said. His parents were unavailable 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, his mother, Addie Green, told the Associated Press that she didn't 
know what to call her son. " 'Trout Fishing in America' is a little long," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Trout admitted that his father swallowed hard at the news, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me how sad he was," Trout said. "Peter Eastman was a very traditional 
name in his family. It is his name and his father's name."  
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of his grandfather, Trout called him with the news. In Australia. "I 
don't believe he really understood," Trout said. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see. Eighty-year-old man in Australia. Teen-age grandson in United 
States. California, no less! No more Peter Eastman Jr. I'm now Trout Fishing in 
America? 
</P>
<P>
 What's not to understand? 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction from others was swift. Classmates greeted him with hallway shouts 
of "TROUT!" 
</P>
<P>
 "The novelty, I hope, will wear off," Trout said. "I think the day will soon 
come when people will call me Trout and not be so excited about it." 
</P>
<P>
 That will likely happen the day Barney Fife joins the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly the commotion has not subsided yet. The phone has been ringing off 
the hook -- there's a word that Trout can't be very fond of -- as radio 
stations across the country, and one in Australia, beg for an interview. Trout 
has gone along with every request. Even the knucklehead from ABC News who 
called from Washington, D.C., at 4 o'clock the other morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of it has been obnoxious," Trout said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another call came from another Trout. A man named Trout Pomelroy from Michigan 
called to congratulate the latest Trout. "He was very supportive," California's 
Trout said. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the attention, Trout hopes, will come a message. A message that 
Brautigan's books helped . . . well, can we say spawned ? 
</P>
<P>
 "What I hope comes of all this is that people can start to see that we don't 
need so many rigid social laws," Trout said. "I just don't see why a person 
can't be named Trout Fishing in America without it being such a big deal. It 
seems we are all trapped in just one frame of mind. We have closed our minds to 
new ideas, and that is not good. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peter Eastman was a proud name. It still is. But it was time for me to become 
my own person." 
</P>
<P>
 Trout heads for college -- the urge to school? -- in the fall. He has been 
accepted into UC Santa Barbara and UC Santa Cruz, but he has his mind set on a 
tiny private school in Vermont -- Marlboro College. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the pilot thing will work out. But if not, in college he will major in . 
. . marine biology. 
</P>
<P>
 Just kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberal arts.

LOCAL HERO / BILLY HAYES: GIVING KIDS SOMEONE TO COUNT ON; MAN WHOSE STORY WAS 
TOLD IN FILM 'MIDNIGHT EXPRESS' IS VOLUNTEER MENTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIBBY SLATE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been almost two decades since the young American Billy Hayes escaped the 
Turkish prison where he survived a grueling five years for hashish smuggling, a 
story that became famous when it was depicted in the 1978 film, "Midnight 
Express."  
</P>
<P>
 Hayes, 46, has long since turned his life around. He's in show business, as an 
actor, writer, director -- he was nominated by the Los Angeles Drama Critics 
Assn. in 1992 for the play "Cock and Bull Story" -- and producer, with a CBS 
television movie in development.  
</P>
<P>
 And for the past three years, he has tried to help some of Hollywood's street 
kids turn their lives around by volunteering as a mentor with the Los Angeles 
Free Clinic's Project STEP (Short Term Employment Program). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Based at the Free Clinic's Hollywood Boulevard center, the program provides 
homeless and high-risk youth with day labor while it helps them develop skills 
to find permanent jobs. Each mentor spends at least an hour a week with a young 
person over a period of several months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have answers to a lot of things, but I know how to get them -- how to 
get a driver's license, how to apply for a job, how to write a resume, how to 
be sexually aware, which is life and death on the street," Hayes says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's also about being a friend," he adds. "I can give advice like 'Don't get 
arrested in Turkey,' but a lot is really about following through on a 
commitment -- being there. Most of these kids don't have anyone to count on. 
They've had less than ideal home circumstances, no support there, so they've 
left and found themselves here on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes says his prison experience has proved an asset. "It gives me some sort 
of weird validation, talking about the street, about the less than 'straight' 
world," he says. "To a lot of them here, the straight world is an anathema. In 
the '60s, I roamed the world, lived in strange ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes is working with his third Free Clinic client, 23-year-old Seven Jenkins, 
a drummer with a group called BBQ. When Jenkins shows up for their weekly 
session, they discuss openings for bus boys at a new local restaurant, and 
Hayes offers Jenkins a ride there. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes has taught all three of his clients to drive -- on his own time to avoid 
possible insurance problems for the clinic. Jenkins is still learning; Hayes' 
two previous charges acquired driver's licenses with his help.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was amazed -- nobody had talked to these guys about how to drive," he says. 
"It's something so basic. It gives you independence." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his work produces less tangible results. Hayes discussed his early 
years with Jenkins to make a connection between his tumultuous past and the 
creative life he now leads, and he used his director's eye to comment on the 
rapport between drummer and audience when he watched Jenkins perform recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got out of prison, I was a folk hero," Hayes says. "I was suddenly 
famous for being an escaped convict-drug smuggler. That's not what I want. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to do something to change the world, but it's hard to do that in a big 
way. It's easier in small amounts and actually more practical, too, on a 
day-to-day basis. We could use a lot more mentors here -- every kid you take 
off the street is one less potential homeless person or crime victim.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great way for the community to help itself. And it's expanded my life, 
meeting these kids instead of focusing on my own problems. As trite as it 
sounds, you really do get more out of it than you put in." 
</P>

POWER PLAY IN ANAHEIM; CHILDREN GET IN FIGHTING SPIRIT AS THEY WAIT HOURS TO 
SEE MIGHTY MORPHIN RANGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kids generally only get to see the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers once a week, 
on television every Saturday morning. This last Saturday, for instance, the 
five teen-aged stars morphed into their kick-boxing super-hero alter egos to 
fight Rita Repulsa's forces of galactic evil at a circus, bringing in their 
techno-saurus transformer monsters when they really needed to kick some serious 
alien booty. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahh, but that same day several thousand lucky children and their parents in 
Orange County got to wait in line for hours at the Anaheim Convention Center 
for a second helping of the Power Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot this time was that spandex-clad Power Rangers Tommy and Kimberly 
appeared to be held captive in the convention center's spaceship-like arena, 
fenced off and surrounded by Repulsa's minions, who were disguised this time as 
burly humans wearing wind breakers marked Security . Helpless to escape, except 
for 10-minute rest breaks every 20 or 30 minutes, all Tommy and Kimberly could 
do was kick-box the air and wave to their young supporters who were being 
paraded by them, as if to witness the totality of their defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a sad tableau. It sort of made one want to grab a bullhorn and shout: 
"Oh, but who will help these Power Rangers? Arise, children, and set your 
heroes free!" 
</P>
<P>
 A more mundane, if accurate, scenario is that actors Jason Frank and Amy Jo 
Johnson, playing the pair of Power Rangers, were appearing at the convention 
center as part of the sixth annual Kids Stuff Expo. Originally their appearance 
was to have been incorporated into the body of the event, which was taking 
place two buildings away, in Hall D. But after a Power Rangers show last month 
at Universal Studios drew 35,000 people and jammed the neighboring freeways, 
expo organizers moved the Rangers into the arena and tripled security.  
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't unwarranted. By the time the doors opened at 10 a.m. Saturday, 
several thousand restless kids and parents were lined up around the facility, 
snaking back for nearly a block down the not-entirely-hospitable asphalt truck 
lane behind the exhibition halls. Many had been in line for more than two 
hours, and any number of kids were amusing themselves by battling on the grass. 
</P>
<P>
 These kids, of course, never would rise up to threaten the shins of the 
security guards, because -- even though Rangers episodes are two-thirds sword 
fights and robot fisticuffs -- a representative of the show recently told The 
Times that it engenders "teamwork, self-discipline and self-esteem" in kids. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Talking to several kids, one indeed did get the feeling that the show 
encourages them to share certain ideals: 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why he likes the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Gabriel Vega, 6, of El 
Monte said: "They fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Sasha Morales, 7, of Garden Grove said she likes them "because they fight, and 
they're heroes." 
</P>
<P>
 Felicia Fielden, 5, of Long Beach said: "The Power Rangers fight all the bad 
guys. I like the green one best: Tommy. He's got the cool dinosaur." 
</P>
<P>
 John Madrid, 10, of Santa Ana likes 'em "because they fight all kinds of 
people" while Jimmy Ramirez, 9, of Fullerton, is more particular: "I like them 
because they fight evil villains that want to destroy the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone likes them because they fight. "I like them because they do 
karate and transform," said Scott Alvarado, 5, of Orange. Travis Eaves, 7, of 
Riverside, said he likes Ranger Tommy especially "because he does more martial 
arts." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Over in Hall D, handfuls of kids were attending creative exhibits on science, 
bicycle safety and interactive computers. Meanwhile, the thousands who had 
waited to see the Power Rangers eventually were ushered into the unadorned 
Spartan confines of the arena. There, the heavy metal Power Ranger theme 
repeated on an endless tape loop. "Let's go, Power Rangers! Go go, Power 
Rangers!" it enthused, and enthused and enthused. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Rangers gamely were go go-ing, doing their acrobatics and karate 
moves, pressing the flesh and posing briefly with the kids: Families got about 
10 seconds each of quality time with the heroes. "He talked to me!" Alvarado 
gushed after meeting Frank/Tommy. "He said: 'Hi, it was nice meeting you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After the first hour, though, the setup was changed so that fans no longer had 
direct contact. Barriers were brought in to keep the lines away from the low 
platform where the Rangers performed, though the ever-cheerful Frank and 
Johnson did sometimes run up to speed-squeeze a few hands. The line then was 
rushed past them, and the security was so busy yelling "keep moving" that if 
the Rangers had happened to shout "Hooray for teamwork and self-discipline!" in 
mid-kick, no one would have heard them. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cattle-drive pace may have been necessary to accommodate the numbers, 
and in any case, most kids still seemed pleased to have seen their heroes in 
the flesh, however briefly. One, 8-year-old Danielle Cook of Anaheim, suggested 
that organizers might have let people sit in the thousands of unused arena 
seats, so at least they could watch the Rangers as they waited for a closer 
look. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents weren't nearly so level-headed. Several were furious. 
</P>
<P>
 "For two hours waiting outside we get two seconds?" griped Kimberly Salsbury 
of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really wasn't worth it," Jennifer Rush of West Covina complained. "They 
don't want the kids to touch them or anything. They move you through so fast, 
unless you have the aggression to go back and demand they shake their hand, 
you're out of luck." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Miguel Chavarria of El Monte saw how little time kids were being given 
with the Rangers, he unleashed a stream of expletives. He said he had been 
waiting more than three hours, and that "people were cutting in line right at 
the entrance, and the people that are working here, they didn't care. 
</P>
<P>
 "And then once you get in, they're pushing you out! My kids like the Power 
Rangers and we'll do anything for the kids. But from here, I think I'm heading 
to the racetrack."

'SCHINDLER'S' ADDS A PAIR TO THE LIST; AWARDS: SPIELBERG EPIC TAKES MORE HONORS 
-- FOR SCREENWRITING AND EDITING. JANE CAMPION'S 'THE PIANO' ALSO WINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the 66th Academy Awards a week away, Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's 
List" continued to dominate the film awards season over the weekend, adding 
honors for screenwriting and editing to its already impressive array of prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the stage is set for "Schindler's List" to sweep the Academy Awards, 
with more than a possibility that the movie will win Oscars in all 12 
categories for which it was nominated, including best motion picture of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In ceremonies Sunday night at the Beverly Hilton, the Writers Guild of America 
gave Steven Zaillian's script the prize for best 1993 screenplay based on 
material previously produced or published. The film was based on the novel by 
Thomas Keneally about World War II Nazi industrialist Oskar Schindler, who 
employed Jews in his factory and kept them from death in Nazi-run concentration 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Campion's script for "The Piano" won the Writers Guild award for best 
screenplay written directly for the screen. "The Piano," which Campion also 
directed and for which she became only the second woman in Academy Awards 
history to receive an Oscar nomination for best direction, is the dramatic 
story of a woman in turn-of-the-century New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Piano" is also a contender for the Oscar for best picture and the writers 
guild award comes on top of many critics' association prizes for Campion and 
leading actress Holly Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday night, the American Cinema Editors gathered at the Regent Beverly 
Wilshire for dinner ceremonies at which veteran film editor Michael Kahn won 
the "Eddie Award" for best edited motion picture of 1993 for "Schindler's 
List." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most film awards programs, the American Cinema Editors banquet remains 
largely a low-key event with the few TV cameras confined to the entrance. And 
despite the presence of several major celebrities, including a reunited Don 
Johnson and Melanie Griffin, there was only a handful of fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Beatty, who thanked the group for keeping the show low-key, presented 
the career achievement award to Dede Allen, who edited his "Reds" and one of 
his more celebrated starring vehicles, "Bonnie and Clyde." Allen was at home 
ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Later the same evening, actress Ann Blyth presented a career achievement award 
to Gene Ruggiero, who began at MGM in the 1920s under then-chairman Nicholas 
Schenck and whose editing included films such as "Ninotchka," "Oklahoma!" and 
"Around the World in 80 Days."

LOOKING FOR MR. LETTERMAN; WHO WILL PORTRAY THE PLAYERS IN HBO'S 'THE LATE 
SHIFT'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the announcement was made last week that HBO wants to make a movie out of 
"The Late Shift," the book chronicling the behind-the-scenes power struggles 
over the replacement of Johnny Carson as host of "The Tonight Show," the 
water-cooler question with which Hollywood seemed to be having the most fun was 
who will portray the key players. 
</P>
<P>
 The impish Tom Hanks was suggested by several talent agents as a good choice 
for David Letterman. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Leno nominated Lorenzo Lamas, the stud star of "Renegade," to play him. He 
also suggested Alec Baldwin and Tom Cruise. Others thought Randy Quaid would 
make a decent Leno. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Leno's former manager, Helen Kushnick, whose strong-arm tactics with 
"Tonight Show" guests forced NBC to fire her as executive producer of the show, 
one talent agent suggested Faye Dunaway in a reprise of her "Mommie Dearest" 
role. Some thought Tyne Daly looks a lot like Kushnick. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Stringer, president of the CBS Broadcast Group, who successfully lured 
Letterman away from NBC after the "Tonight" job went to Leno, volunteered 
Anthony Hopkins to play him. And virtually everyone pointed to former 
"thirtysomething" star Timothy Busfield, with his red hair and beard, as a 
ringer for NBC Entertainment President Warren Littlefield, who successfully 
fought to retain Leno. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood frequently scurries to turn scandalous news events into sensational 
TV docudramas. But, in this case, the news event in question involves major 
players in the entertainment industry, and, if the project comes to fruition, 
HBO will be swinging the cameras onto Hollywood itself. 
</P>
<P>
 And the picture, as chronicled in "The Late Shift," by New York Times writer 
Bill Carter, isn't always pretty. In one incident, Leno, with no manager or 
agent to look out for him, hid in an adjoining room during a phone conference 
among NBC executives to hear what they were saying about him. Later, he called 
Littlefield in a hotel room, when Littlefield happened to be sitting on the 
toilet, and revealed what he heard in the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's challenging about portraying these people is you don't want to insult 
them, because you have to work with them again," said a TV casting director at 
one of the studios. "I'm sure Littlefield wouldn't be too happy if you brought 
in Ed Begley Jr. to play him. I'm just really grateful I don't have that job." 
</P>
<P>
 The topic of greatest conversation appeared to be who would portray Michael 
Ovitz, the super-agent who heads Creative Artists Agency and can make or break 
a career. Although few people outside the entertainment industry may be able to 
pick him out of a crowd, Ovitz has a ubiquitous presence in Hollywood. He was a 
prominent player in engineering Letterman's departure from NBC to accept a 
$14-million-a-year deal at CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a tossup between Richard Widmark and Tom Arnold for Michael 
Ovitz," said a William Morris agent. Steve Guttenberg was mentioned as another 
possibility, based on resemblance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael Keaton," offered another agent at William Morris. "Think of his 
alter-ego role as Bruce Wayne in 'Batman' -- clean-cut, looks good in the 
two-piece suit, menacing." 
</P>
<P>
 The same agent went on to explain, though, that whoever plays Ovitz really has 
nothing to lose. "It was almost like Michael Ovitz could have written that book 
('The Late Shift') himself," he explained. "He was painted in such a wonderful 
light, as the one who solved the problem and made David Letterman an extremely 
wealthy man." 
</P>
<P>
 And how do the players themselves feel about being portrayed on screen?  
</P>
<P>
 Ovitz did not care to comment. Neither did Leno, although he reportedly is not 
happy about the HBO deal. Letterman could not be reached. One of the players 
who figured into the book and asked not to be identified explained dryly: "I 
don't think anyone involved is really interested in making this into a movie." 
</P>
<P>
 One agent put it this way: "Everybody's nightmare who works in the business is 
to be caught in an unflattering way. If you read any of (screenwriter) William 
Goldman's books, you know. One fart and they call you stinky the rest of your 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 HBO has had experience in this area, having turned the corporate takeover of 
RJR Nabisco into the Emmy-winning "Barbarians at the Gate," a stinging farce 
starring James Garner. Robert Cooper, senior vice president of HBO Pictures, 
has heard naysayers before. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was doing 'Barbarians,' everyone was saying, 'How are you going to do 
a comedy about leverage-management buyouts? How are you going to make people 
laugh about that?' So I'm beyond all that," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An agent at CAA believes casting is not what will make "The Late Shift" a 
successful movie, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought what HBO did with 'Barbarians' was fantastic," he said. "The key is 
going to be -- and it's the key with every movie -- what kind of script are 
they going to get? The script is more of an issue than casting. Without that 
Larry Gelbart script, 'Barbarians' would have laid a total egg. Instead, it was 
magical." 
</P>
<P>
 HBO at this point does not have a script, a writer, a director or a producer 
for "The Late Shift" project, which will probably take at least 18 months to 
put together. Carter, who authored the book and will be a consultant on the 
film, expects a comedy but not a spoof of late-night TV, which HBO already has 
in the form of "The Larry Sanders Show." 
</P>
<P>
 "They like the connection to 'Barbarians at the Gate'; they noted that overtly 
in the press release," Carter said. "There are dark comedy elements they're 
talking about. And they love the idea of big stories with familiar characters 
like this. They think that gives you instant attention and interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper said he will look for lesser-known actors to play Letterman and Leno. 
"I would not get look-alikes -- the best Letterman or Leno clones. I would get 
the best actors who match their attitudes ." 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, the challenge will be great because, unlike many subjects of 
docudramas, Letterman and Leno are seen every night on national TV before 
millions of people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally think they are so familiar that, as an actor, it's not even a 
challenge to play them because it's imitation, not acting," the TV casting 
director said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's simply imitation because everyone knows who they are and what their 
mannerisms are like. Impersonation or imitation is not the same as creating 
your own character." But Can Anyone Play Larry Bud? 
</P>
<P>
 Who would you pick to play some of the biggest names in television? That is 
the question being bandied about now that HBO has said it wants to make a movie 
of "The Late Shift," the book about the battle between Jay Leno an David 
Letterman to take over "The Tonight Show." One approach favors going for 
look-alikes; the other went for attitude. At this point it's all speculation; 
HBO hasn't even lined up a writer yet. Jay Leno: Randy Quaid David Letterman: 
Tom Hanks Michael Ovitz: Steve Guttenberg Howard Stringer: Anthony Hopkins 
Warren Littlefield: Timothy Busfield Helen Kushnick: Faye Dunaway

HOWARD ROSENBERG: PEOPLE'S CHOICE: MANSON, DAHMER; TELEVISION: THE HIGH RATINGS 
FOR NEWS PROGRAMS FEATURING JAILED MURDERERS SHOW VIEWERS GET WHAT THEY WANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 You want it, you get it. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints pour in about how some news programs and much of the rest of 
television are turning tabloid. Greasy, twisted, hideous, frightening, 
irresponsible, screw-the-public, make-a-buck-at-any-cost tabloid. Such 
sanctimonious hand wringing by critics, such scowls, such shrieks of protest. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happens? 
</P>
<P>
 Last Wednesday's premiere of the ABC News program "Turning Point" -- 
co-starring Diane Sawyer with ghoulish Charles Manson and two of his now 
middle-aged "girls" -- is a Nielsen semi-blockbuster, winning its time slot 
with 30% of the audience while earning what ABC says are record ratings for the 
premiere of a newsmagazine series. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Nielsen's figures, you could estimate that as many as 35 million 
inquiring minds tuned in, enough for "Turning Point" to soundly whip NBC's "Law 
& Order" and obliterate "48 Hours" on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Turning Point" ratings were so high, Jay Leno cracked Thursday night, that 
competing NBC is planning a special for next month titled "The Manson Family 
Honors." Manson will appear on the program, he added, but has refused to 
perform. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Wednesday, the 1992 debut of "NBC Dateline" held the ratings record for 
a newsmagazine premiere, but that program attracted one-third fewer viewers 
than "Turning Point." 
</P>
<P>
 And speaking of "NBC Dateline," last Tuesday's edition generated its own best 
ratings ever, beating the heavily promoted -- and usually heavily watched -- 
annual "People's Choice Awards" on CBS. The featured segment on "NBC Dateline" 
that night? An interview with Jeffrey Dahmer, the value of which was to note 
that cannibalism can land you in jail -- and on television. 
</P>
<P>
 It's obvious now that serial killers have become the people's choice. 
</P>
<P>
 They are increasingly TV's choice. Scheduled to headline a March 23 episode of 
"Turning Point" are the families of serial killers. Why stop there? Why not the 
best friends of serial killers? The pet pooches of serial killers? The 
gardeners? You name it. "Turning Point" could ride this gore through the rest 
of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joking about the "Turning Point" and "NBC Dateline" programs, Leno urged 
viewers to tune in "Unsolved Mysteries" next week, when "Robert Stack will 
spend the entire hour investigating the disappearance of real journalism in 
this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Which parallels the disappearance of taste. So much so that, as we await the 
Fox movie and the CBS miniseries on the Menendez brothers, it's hard to imagine 
a tabloid scenario that would be too cynical or bizarre for television. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, these topics wouldn't get on the air, again and again and again, if 
there weren't an audience for them. As the ratings affirm, the audience for 
them is enormous, reflecting a ravenous public hunger for sensational crime 
topics that contradicts the protestations about such programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning point, indeed. Last week's Nielsens may be a seminal moment in the 
history of TV's newsmagazines, to say nothing of the wider media -- in effect 
validating the increasingly contemptible editorial choices that are being made. 
You know how it goes: "The public is making us do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The more we see of these topics -- the more they linger on the air and the 
more we get accustomed to them -- the more we'll become desensitized to their 
negativity and harmfulness. 
</P>
<P>
 Diverting our attention from things more relevant, they literally scare the 
hell out of us, creating and feeding a fear far out of proportion to reality, 
leaving the impression that Charlie Mansons and Jeffrey Dahmers lurk en masse 
outside every door. Instead, they lurk in the minds of an increasing number of 
news executives. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC News President Roone Arledge obviously knew what he was doing when -- 
offering no excuses or platitudes -- he scheduled Manson to open "Turning 
Point." But was it that washed-up freak Manson alone who was the draw, in 
conjunction with his accomplices in the 1969 Tate-LaBianca murders, or was it 
Diane Sawyer? Or was it the charismatic pairing of these two troupers that 
viewers found so magical? If so, stay tuned for Manson II. 
</P>
<P>
 All right , Charlie. You're on your way again. Stare that stare, grin that 
grin, sing that song. What the viewers want, they get. And what they want is 
you.

LISTENERS SETTING THEIR DIALS TO 'SCREW RADIO'; BROADCASTING: THE PROGRAM, 
WHICH AIRS DAILY ON KWIZ (96.7), HAS DRAWN A LOYAL FOLLOWING BY OFFERING AN 
OFFBEAT MIX OF ROCK, TALK AND COMEDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Greg Ginn began to lease time on radio station KWIZ (96.7) here last 
July, his principal intentions were to learn how to produce a radio show and to 
give valuable exposure to artists on his own SST, Cruz and New Alliance record 
labels. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a fairly shrewd maneuver considering that virtually all of Ginn's 
adventurous bands and spoken word artists -- a group that includes noise-punk 
unit Rig, avant-jazz group Bazooka and poet Wanda Coleman -- routinely are 
shunned by commercial radio. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Ginn's indelicately dubbed "Screw Radio" program (which can be 
heard weeknights and Sundays from midnight to 1 a.m. and Saturdays and Sundays 
from 8 to 10 p.m.) broadened its scope. No longer just a platform from which to 
plug a designated set of underground artists, it now is part rock, part talk 
and part comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to go on the radio and just play music," says Ginn, who first came 
to prominence in the early '80s as the guitarist and primary songwriter for the 
trailblazing Los Angeles punk band Black Flag. "So it was important to have 
another element that revealed the (irreverent, satirical) vibe surrounding the 
record labels. The show's picked up a lot of listeners through the talk and 
humor, and that's turned a lot of new people on to the music." 
</P>
<P>
 Broadcast from Ginn's Casa Destroy recording studio in Long Beach, Screw Radio 
is given its uniquely offbeat character by its nerdy host, "Poindexter 
Stewart," and his loyal sidekicks, two Southern rednecks named Jimbo and 
Buford. Between sets of songs, the three spout off about anything and 
everything from their distaste for Pearl Jam singer Eddie Vedder to the logic 
behind the latest L.A. Clippers basketball trade. They also field calls from 
listeners, many of whom seem to share their wacky irreverence and sometimes 
risque sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Poindexter Stewart actually is the usually mild-mannered and soft-spoken Ginn 
in the guise of a wimpy, whiny and slightly hyper radio personality and 
alternative rock musician (Ginn even released an album under the Stewart name 
last year). 
</P>
<P>
 "The character is kind of modeled after the most irritating person I can 
imagine," Ginn explains with a laugh. "It started as a parody of what I see as 
the superficial elements in the (alternative rock) record business. It's kind 
of a slacker thing: The character is lazy but expects a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's more complicated than that. That's the starting-off point for 
Poindexter Stewart. I also try to make a lot of my own points with it, even 
though they're kind of coming from this lame personality.' 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, for instance, Screw Radio gets on a decidedly political track. 
Ginn recalls one program that turned into a lengthy and heated debate over 
illegal immigration, with listeners on both sides of the issue calling in. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the talk, though, is loose chatter and humor, especially during the 
two-hour weekend shows. Ginn says some regular callers have gone as far as to 
create their own specific characters for the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "One regular calls in and sings Black Flag songs with this (Latino) accent," 
Ginn says. "He totally changes the words to the songs. We have the greatest 
regular callers. It's amazing how creative they've been." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Ginn says he doesn't want the phone calls and jokes to overshadow the 
music being played. The show not only features prerecorded music but also band 
interviews and occasional live performances by SST, New Alliance and Cruz 
artists. The instrumental group Gone -- which includes Ginn, bassist Steve 
Sharp (who plays the Jimbo character) and drummer Gregory Moore -- is Screw 
Radio's official house band. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondays are devoted entirely to the music of Black Flag. In what can be seen 
as a measure of the group's tremendous influence, Ginn notes that the 
listenership on Mondays includes many young people who latched onto Black Flag 
after its breakup in 1986. The band's bassist, Chuck Dukowski, "came on 
recently and we got a lot of calls and a lot of questions. I don't remember any 
of the callers actually having seen the band." 
</P>
<P>
 Ginn begins a two-month tour of the United States Wednesday to promote his own 
most recent albums and Screw Radio will be altering its regular format yet 
again: Poindexter Stewart, Buford and Jimbo will be reporting from the road via 
prerecorded tapes, though they do plan to call into the show live occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginn says that originally he had no intention of hosting Screw Radio. 
Overseeing the show and his three labels, and rehearsing and recording material 
for his own musical projects, was leaving him with little free time, so he'd 
lined up someone named Andy Dunkley to host. But Dunkley left at the end of 
last year, and Ginn found himself piloting the show both on and off the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started (hosting), I was totally scared," he recalls. "But now 
it's very comfortable. I look forward to it every day. I haven't missed a show 
since I started. It's a stretch because I have a lot of other things to do, but 
I like radio so much that it's really like a dream come true."

MURDERER GACY'S ART BRUT GETS BEVERLY HILLS DISPLAY; CULTURE: THE SERIAL KILLER 
REVEALS SELF WITH PAINTING, SAYS SHOW'S CURATOR -- 'THERE IS MORE TO (HIM) THAN 
33 MURDERS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man out on a Saturday-night shopping stroll wandered into a Beverly Hills 
art gallery, Neiman-Marcus bags in hand, and responded with a slight, bemused 
start when he saw just which Midwesterner's work was being displayed in this 
tony setting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know John Wayne Gacy was an artist!" exclaimed the browser, to no 
one in particular. "Does he paint in blood?" 
</P>
<P>
 The nearby curator held his tongue. Arthur Deco, who put together the Gacy 
exhibition now showing at the Tatou gallery, gets a lot of this sort of thing, 
bemusement running just about neck and neck with disgust as spontaneous 
reactions go. And displaying three-dozen works by a painter renowned as 
America's most notorious and prodigious serial killer does demand a certain 
public stoicism. 
</P>
<P>
 Gacy was convicted in 1980 of killing 33 boys and young men throughout the 
'70s in a Chicago suburb; although he was suspected of having slaughtered even 
more, the conservative count still stands as a domestic record. After 14 years 
on Death Row, Gacy stands a good chance of facing the electric chair in the 
next few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Which means, of course, that his work will appreciate like crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 Deco's task with this exhibition, he says, is to show "that there is more to 
John Gacy than 33 murders, and when you're talking about art brut , more to the 
people that create it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although folk art is a burgeoning field in America, Deco says that the 
subgenre known as art brut -- or art by the criminally insane -- is better 
appreciated in Europe right now. He's under no delusion that Gacy's work is 
"good" by any conventional art standard. 
</P>
<P>
 "If John Gacy didn't kill 33 people, I wouldn't be holding this exhibition; I 
think there's something that can be learned about the person who created it, 
and what that is is up to the audience," Deco said. "When people study Picasso, 
they dissect the work -- it's an endless task -- trying to learn something 
about Picasso. If they assume there's nothing you can learn from this work, 
it's just wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Gacy's paintings may be easier to learn from than others. Art critics 
may be stymied by Gacy's fondness for replicating Disney's Seven Dwarfs, 
although the fact that Snow White isn't represented in any of the paintings may 
somehow be telling. His sketches of Christ, Elvis, Don Quixote, Dillinger and 
Hitler may seem pretty basic beginner exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of greater morbid interest are his more macabre paintings -- lots of skulls, 
one with blood on the teeth, another with male and female genitalia pictured 
inside the eye sockets. But Gacy's real stock in trade is his self-portraits as 
Pogo the Clown, a persona he worked under at children's parties, where he 
apparently met some of his victims; these smiling portraitures are, inevitably, 
most sinister of all. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw the clown, that one right over there, it gave me the chills," said 
Yolanda Arreola, who'd wandered over from the Tatou nightclub next door, drink 
in hand, pointing to the exhibition's highest-priced work (at $20,000), a 
disturbing image of an open-mouthed clown with fangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on display at the Tatou Gallery is some of Gacy's prison correspondence, 
which (full of salutations like "Happy Passover" and "watch out for the flu") 
doesn't belie much overt insanity -- although some may find benign notations 
like "Hey I am a doer not just a thinker" slightly chilling anyhow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's exciting -- it makes you try to put yourself in the position of 
Gacy himself, see what thoughts led him to do what he did," said another 
browser, Tom Kalili, thinking about purchasing a soft-bound book of Gacy's 
letters. "It's interesting, the transition one can make from a well-respected 
businessman to . . . this. It makes you question what intelligence is." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone finds the display illuminating. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Poynton, an actor and limousine driver, has been calling everyone from 
Tatou's owners to the Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce this week to register 
the "shock and disgust" he felt upon seeing the exhibition after dropping off 
some patrons there. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Monday, The Times ran a story on a restaurant down in Laguna that removed 
nudes off the walls after several decades because people were offended by 
them," noted Poynton. "The next day, I go to Beverly Hills and see a display of 
Gacy's work, and I couldn't believe it. It reeks of the same sort of odor as 
(Ice-T's rap song) 'Cop Killer.' It condones violence, in the name of profit."

 Deco pointed out that Gacy won't receive any proceeds from the sales, although 
the private collectors who've invested in the paintings certainly stand to. 
Business has been OK with this exhibition, which ends Wednesday, he said; it's 
anyone's guess how it'll go when he brings it next to Gacy's hometown, Chicago, 
"which should raise a few eyebrows." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the curious quipster with the Neiman bag, Bob Kline, turned out to 
be a Hollywood deal-maker who, coincidentally, recently packaged a biopic of 
another killer, "Jeffrey Dahmer: The Secret Life," now on video shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Which didn't make him any more sympathetic toward Gacy's ouevre . 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, when he's not imitating Dali, he's rather primitive, but that's him -- 
a primitive person," said Kline. "I guess he killed people better than he 
painted."

KNBC SHOWS COMMITMENT TO LATINOS; TELEVISION: STATION EXECS PROMISE AN EMPHASIS 
ON DIVERSITY -- BUT INSIST EXECUTIVE'S LEAVING WAS NOT TIED TO ALLEGATIONS OF 
BIAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Leaders of two Latino journalists organizations said late last week they were 
pleased with management changes at KNBC-TV Channel 4, which they believe show a 
commitment to the hiring and promotion of Latinos in the newsroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're definitely happy, and we think what KNBC is doing will make a change," 
said Al Reyes, head of the California Chicano News Media Assn., which, with the 
National Hispanic Media Coalition, had met with network executives to express 
their concerns about the station's treatment of Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC executives on Friday announced the resignation of KNBC President and 
General Manager Reed Manville following several months of turmoil at the 
station, including reports of low staff morale and the departure of five Latino 
news reporters and anchors who charged that racial bias played a role in their 
exits. 
</P>
<P>
 At a staff meeting to announce the resignation, John H. Rohrbeck, NBC 
Television Stations President, told newsroom personnel that NBC and its owner, 
General Electric, were committed to erasing concerns over alleged 
discrimination and to diversifying the newsroom. 
</P>
<P>
 While not specifically addressing the recent charges of discrimination against 
management, Rohrbeck said there would soon be a Burbank-based executive in 
charge of overseeing diversity at KNBC and NBC's West Coast operation. This 
official will work in conjunction with a director of diversity already situated 
at NBC in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrbeck had met in the last few weeks with Reyes and National Hispanic Media 
Coalition President Esther Renteria about their concerns over the exodus of 
Latinos from KNBC since last March. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who left said they felt that Latino journalists had been 
consistently treated with disrespect and pushed into the background since Mark 
Hoffman took over as news director last March, while white male reporters 
received preferential treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Manville denied the allegations, saying that discrimination had played no role 
in the departures. But Renteria said that Rohrbeck had been concerned about the 
charges and told her and Reyes that he would correct the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very concerned, and I'm very pleased that this diversity person is 
coming in," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrbeck said Friday that Manville's resignation was not connected to the 
charges of discrimination. But he added that despite rising viewership and 
sales revenue, there was a "perceived" problem among the newsroom staff of low 
morale and other problems that called for "a change in leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 "These problems had taken on a life of their own," he said. "They could have 
been overcome in time, but in this business, time is a luxury we don't have. 
Reed recognized this." 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrbeck added, "There was a general morale situation that was wrongly 
perceived, but it continued and would have continued. It had to be put to bed, 
and we had to get everyone focusing not on the past but on the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrbeck, himself a former general manager of KNBC, will take over the daily 
operation of the station until a new president and general manager is named. 
Manville joined the station in 1985 and became president in November, 1991. He 
could not be reached for comment.

COUNTERPUNCH: A 'SUNSET' WITHOUT LUPONE IS DARK DAY FOR THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN WEIN, Glenn Wein is director, co-creator and an actor in Grandma 
Sylvia's Funeral, which has been running for 18 months at the Hudson Theatre. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Isn't anyone going to speak up for the great Patti LuPone?  
</P>
<P>
 I've been waiting in vain for people in the entertainment business to protest 
her public humiliation: She has been unceremoniously dropped from the coming 
New York production of "Sunset Boulevard," which instead will feature Glenn 
Close, now the star of the L.A. version. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a fanatical theater-goer and can count on my fingers the few really great 
musical theater performances that have been available to someone who has come 
of age in the 1980s. Not since Jennifer Holliday got people to stand on their 
seats in "Dreamgirls" have I witnessed the excitement that Patti LuPone created 
at London's Adelphi Theatre in "Sunset Boulevard." It is a crime that audiences 
who love the theater as much as I do will be robbed of seeing LuPone's truly 
great musical theater performance. 
</P>
<P>
 I was in agreement with the London critics when they reported that LuPone's 
brilliance had overshadowed composer Andrew Lloyd Webber's mediocrity. It 
reminded me of the reviews I'd read of Barbra Streisand in Jule Styne's star 
vehicle "Funny Girl." 
</P>
<P>
 I was quite astonished when the New York critics descended on London and 
violently disagreed with their British colleagues. They ripped LuPone's 
performance to shreds after she'd already been hailed as a shining example of 
the best that Broadway has to offer. According to the New York critics: "LuPone 
was too young." Not on stage. "LuPone was too strident." Not nearly as strident 
as the prototype for her role, Gloria Swanson, was in the film. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Patti LuPone broke my heart and thrilled me with her voice. Glenn Close is a 
gifted and glamorous actress, but her singing at the Shubert Theatre did not 
excite me. This is not Sondheim's "A Little Night Music" where the music has 
been tailored for an actress who sings. What is this trend in the musical 
theater to cast actress-singers in great musical roles that are better suited 
for singer-actresses? Tyne Daly's "singing" in "Gypsy" is on CD for posterity 
while Lainie Kazan's brilliant Westbury Music Fair performance as Mama Rose is 
just a memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Lloyd Webber has made his name in the theater. Patti LuPone is a star 
who is primarily known for her theater work. When are the power people in the 
theater like Lloyd Webber going to respect their own enough to stop kowtowing 
to the snobbism that is reserved for television and film stars? Not giving 
LuPone the role on Broadway is the most shocking mistake since Ethel Merman was 
not allowed to re-create her performance in "Gypsy" on film. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint used to be that Broadway stars were losing their stage roles to 
Hollywood stars when film versions were made. Now they lose their stage roles 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater has gotten even crueler. One day, LuPone may say, "We had voices 
then."

COUNTERPUNCH: TV: SQUARING OFF AGAINST 'ROUNDTABLE WRITING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL BUSBY, Writer-producer Daryl Busby, a veteran of the sitcom 
roundtable, received four nominations this year from the Writers Guild of 
America, an unprecedented number for a single writer, for children's scripts he 
co-authored for the Disney Channel's Adventures in Wonderland. He won the award 
last year. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A debate is raging over "roundtable writing" for film comedies, despite the 
fact that it has been an acceptable method of writing TV sitcoms for years. I 
think it's time to re-evaluate "roundtable writing" for TV, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 First, for those of you who "have" lunch, rather than "do" lunch, let me 
explain that this roundtable does not involve a single knight. It does, 
however, involve a lot of nights -- and very long ones, at that. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, sometime between Lucille Ball and Roseanne Arnold, the comedy 
industry decided that sitcoms could be funnier if the entire staff sat around a 
table, punching up the scripts, line by line. The collective wisdom seems to be 
that if one writer is funny, then 10 are hysterical. And they are. 
Unfortunately, it's not the kind of hysteria anybody had in mind; as the hours 
crawl by, and lunch blurs into dinner, a kind of cabin fever sets in, and soon 
the jokes have little to do with the script. Round about 2 a.m., the writers 
are so slap-happy they'll put any joke down -- especially if they think it will 
get them home any earlier. The inevitable result of focusing so many writers on 
a single script is that, in no time at all, the stockpile dwindles, dooming the 
staff to a cycle of panic writing and impossibly long hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a better way? I think so. It was employed on the Disney Channel's hit 
series "Adventures in Wonderland." And it successfully generated 66 half-hour 
scripts in only nine months. It's a method of working that can save money, 
streamline production, provide work for more writers and, best of all, keep  
</P>
<P>
 network executives from getting crabby. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adventures in Wonderland," a live-action show, is best described as a sitcom 
with music. As head writer of the series, I worked individually with the 
writers, blocking out stories and giving first-draft notes. Once the second 
drafts came in, I met with the second head writer, Tom J. Astle, and our 
network rep, Peggy Christianson (the writer who developed the series). The 
three of us determined what changes needed to be made, and then Tom and I alone 
did the rewrites. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, my staff writers started their next scripts. So instead of 
eight of us sitting around a table for a week, punching up one script, we used 
the time to punch up two scripts and generate six new ones. Consequently, once 
production began, we were nearly always six scripts ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did this system prove beneficial to production, it was also rewarding 
for the writers: Two of the eight have received Writers Guild awards for their 
work, while four others have received nominations.  
</P>
<P>
 Now if this system successfully produced 66 scripts in nine months, think how 
efficient it might be on a network sitcom, which traditionally has years to 
produce the same number of episodes. If two or three writer-producers assume 
the responsibility of rewrites, everyone will be freed of the shackles of the 
roundtable, and remember: Happy writers are funny writers. Scripts will be 
stockpiled quicker, which will allow more time for polishing. And if a script 
has had weeks of punch-up, rather than hours, it will hold up better in 
rehearsal . . . which will eliminate panic rewrites during tape week. 
Eventually, less-harried producers will find they have the extra time necessary 
to work with free-lancers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And just think how happy the networks might be. If a script is locked in a 
week earlier it will mean that a scene that required an expensive set won't be 
dropped suddenly the morning of the taping. The unfortunate actors won't fumble 
pages of hastily rewritten dialogue, requiring endless retakes and pushing 
crews into overtime. Writers of family shows will actually go home to their own 
families for dinner (the money saved on staff meals alone could pay for two 
additional episodes!). 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, I know, there'll always be the unforeseen disaster here and there. But 
maybe it's time to give another system a try. We may finally rid ourselves of 
those medieval nights of the roundtable.

ART-COLLECTING COUPLE CHAMPIONS THE CAUSE OF CRAFTS; DOROTHY AND GEORGE SAXE 
SHOWCASE 120 OBJECTS IN "CONTEMPORARY CRAFTS AND THE SAXE COLLECTION" AT 
NEWPORT ART MUSEUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not that they take no pride in making Art and Antiques magazine's annual 
list of the Top 100 collectors in the United States. But Dorothy and George 
Saxe see it not so much as a personal honor, but rather as recognition for the 
cause they've championed for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides amassing one of the country's leading collections of crafts -- once 
rigidly viewed as inferior to fine arts for its focus on material and technique 
rather than intellectual concept -- the Bay Area couple have long advocated the 
medium's admission into the hallowed halls of mainstream art. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started out to try to have craft material elevated and included in the art 
world," George Saxe said the other day, "and I think that in some small way 
maybe we have done that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A measure of the Saxes' efforts arrives at Newport Harbor Art Museum: 
"Contemporary Crafts and the Saxe Collection" showcases 120 objects from their 
holdings, roughly half of which they donated in 1990 to the Toledo Museum of 
Art, where the show also originated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have never constructed barriers between the decorative arts and the 
so-called fine arts," said Toledo museum director David W. Steadman. "A number 
of major pieces in the Saxe collection have been exhibited within our regular 
contemporary art galleries." 
</P>
<P>
 There should be no separation, agreed Bruce Guenther, chief curator at Newport 
Harbor, which, he said, had never hosted a large craft show. 
</P>
<P>
 Graceful vases, rotund bowls, whimsical figurines, woven wall hangings, 
delicate baskets, sculpture and purely abstract, enigmatic forms make up the 
exhibition of works in glass, clay, fiber, metal and wood. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 100 emerging and well-known artists from around the world are 
represented. Many of them are classed as contemporary artists, not 
craftspeople, and exhibited in fine art galleries and museums. About one-fourth 
are from California, a leader in the crafts movement, including Robert Arneson, 
Viola Frey, Sam Maloof, Peter Voulkos and Beatrice Wood. Ceramist Jerry 
Rothman, who will give a lecture at the museum on May 3, resides in Laguna 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent three-way phone interview from their Menlo Park home, the Saxes 
discussed their passion, Dorothy repeating a point she's obviously made before. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's good art and there's bad art," she said, "and who is to say a 
sculpture made of marble or bronze is anything more wonderful than something 
made of glass or clay? The material is secondary -- it's the concept and 
execution that's paramount -- and we're interested in crafts that have the same 
aesthetic expectations, whether in ideas or in execution, as the best fine 
art." 
</P>
<P>
 Frequent travelers, the couple had always picked up handmade knickknacks 
abroad, but never with any grand intention. Even their first expensive piece -- 
by the renown glass artist Dale Chihuly -- was purchased merely for home 
decoration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always liked glass," Dorothy said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, around the time they began to seek a new, joint avocation -- now that 
their three grown children had left home -- the Saxes discovered a catalogue 
from an exhibition at the Corning Museum of Glass in Upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked through that book," said George, a semi-retired real estate 
developer, "and I said to Dorothy, 'My God, I've never seen anything so 
beautiful in my life.' It just sort of took our breath away, and we said, maybe 
this is something we'd be interested in." 
</P>
<P>
 Concentrating first on glass -- which, along with ceramics, dominates their 
collection -- the Saxes branched out. As the scope of their acquisitions grew, 
so did their efforts to strengthen the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The '80s were a boom time for patronage of all the arts, and, rather than 
buying direct, the Saxes became staunch supporters of a burgeoning 
craft-gallery network. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saxes also began promoting education, joining the boards of the California 
College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland and the renowned Pilchuck Glass School in 
Washington. They continue to allow students to tour their home, where even the 
place mats and each piece of furniture are handcrafted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that this is a field of endeavor that has been under-seen and 
under-appreciated," Dorothy said, "and we do everything we can to make sure the 
work is seen and artists continue to produce it and people continue to 
appreciate it." 
</P>
<P>
 Their gift to the Toledo museum, an art museum that has a long history of 
glass collecting, consists mainly of glass works. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, the Saxes have acquired more than 600 craft items. "Just this 
morning," George Saxe said, Oakland craft artist Gail Fredell "was here. We 
have commissioned her to do our dining-room chairs, and it's been a sort of 
joint venture, where she keeps us posted as she goes through the process of 
development and design and gets feedback from us." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Contemporary Crafts and the Saxe Collection" runs through June 5 at Newport 
Harbor Art Museum, 850 San Clemente Drive, Newport Beach. $2-$4. Tuesday 
through Sunday, 10 a.m.-5 p.m. For related lectures and activities, call (714)

REGIS IS PROUD OF 'LIVE' BUT LOOKIN' AT LATE-NIGHT TOO; TELEVISION: THE POPULAR 
CO-HOST OF THE 3RD-RANKED TALK SHOW SAYS HE'S HAPPY WITH HIS JOB. BUT, HE 
ADMITS, THE THOUGHT OF FOLLOWING 'LETTERMAN' IS APPEALING.

<P>
 Regis Philbin bounds out of a white armchair to retrieve the Nielsen ratings. 
"Now, look at that," says the 60-year-old host, gesturing toward the ratings 
for "Live With Regis and Kathie Lee," the Fred-and-Ginger of TV talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Philbin's seemingly effortless talkfest with Kathie Lee Gifford ("I suggested 
to her early on that we not rehearse our conversation -- just kibbutz about our 
daily lives," he says) is the third-highest ranked syndicated talk show in 
overall ratings, with only Oprah Winfrey and Phil Donahue ranked ahead of it.  
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps because it's a modest little show (with immodest profits in which 
Philbin and Gifford share) favored by the kind of Midwestern tourists who are 
downstairs having their photo taken by the TV monitor at the WABC-TV studios, 
or perhaps because, in 30 years as a TV personality, Philbin has specialized in 
making the job look easy, "Reege" has not been written about like Phil and 
Oprah and certainly not like Philbin's friend David Letterman or even Conan 
O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Conan O'Brien belches in a Hungarian restaurant, it gets written up in the 
newspaper," Philbin complains jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, it's Philbin's name that has been in the newspapers, with speculation 
that he is being considered to host a show at 12:35 a.m. on CBS, following 
"Late Show With David Letterman." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of Letterman's contract with CBS, he and his producers "own" that time 
slot and are developing a talk show for it. Letterman has had Philbin on his 
show as a guest several times and, according to sources, Philbin and CNBC's Tom 
Snyder are on a short list of people being considered. (Bob Costas has already 
turned down the job to re-sign with NBC.) 
</P>
<P>
 Philbin, however, is under contract to do "Live" until August, 1995. "I think 
they'd have to make their move" before he's available to talk, Philbin said. 
</P>
<P>
 He emphasized that he's happy doing the syndicated morning show (seen in 
Southern California weekdays at 9 a.m. on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42). But he 
admitted that the notion of following Letterman was tempting. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (the post-Letterman show) were tomorrow, I'd have to rethink my whole 
situation," Philbin said. "You know, I love this job, and we've got a great 
success going. But, at the same time, the freshness of doing something new is 
appealing. How many make-overs and how many weddings can you do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gifford, who has been Philbin's co-host on "Live" since 1985, is also 
interested in branching out. A New York tabloid, quoting a remark she 
reportedly made during an appearance at a shopping mall in South Carolina, 
recently published a story indicating that Gifford might leave the show. She 
said she had been misquoted and issued a statement saying she wants to stay 
with the series "while continuing to find ways to grow as an artist outside the 
show." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly our wish that she stay. We're in renegotiations, and there's 
nothing on her side that has made us think she won't stay," said Art Moore, the 
executive in charge of production on "Live." "We've never been restrictive" on 
her outside activities, such as her being the TV spokeswoman for a cruise line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we hope Regis is going to want to stay too" when his contract 
comes up for renewal, Moore said. "This is a very successful show, and they've 
both worked too hard to jump off the bandwagon now." 
</P>
<P>
 Philbin did not want to comment on Gifford's plans, but he said, "I think she 
would like to do some outside work, perhaps in a Broadway show." 
</P>
<P>
 One outside activity that Philbin is very serious about is his own exercise 
and fitness video. What prompted him to make it was his own health: A year ago 
he was treated for a blocked artery to his heart. After being treated 
successfully with angioplasty, Philbin embarked on a program of walking and 
other aerobic exercise along with lifting weights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a skinny kid growing up in the Bronx, and I've been lifting weights for 
years," said Philbin, who had worked out on his TV show with guests such as 
Jack LaLanne and Hulk Hogan. "But I wasn't exercising right for my heart." 
</P>
<P>
 In his 55-minute video, the talk-show host is seen getting a lesson in aerobic 
walking from a fitness expert and lifting weights with a trainer. There are 
also appearances by Gifford, who works out on a treadmill, and by Philbin's 
wife, Joy, who works out on a StairMaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "There haven't been many videos by guys and, after so many viewers wrote in 
about my blocked artery, I thought it might be a good idea to do a tape for 
people like me to follow," he said. "We have fun on the tape, but I didn't want 
to put a lot of shtick on it. This is a serious subject." 
</P>
<P>
 Philbin, who works out three times a week, has good pecs for a 60-year-old. 
But the energetic host is at a loss to explain his continuing appeal. "I don't 
know what it is, exactly," he said. "I try to be a guy on TV who doesn't wear 
out his welcome."

THE STYLE FILES: THE PICTURES; HEAD CASES; WHEN A STAR NEEDS CURLY HAIR DOWN TO 
THERE OR MAYBE JUST A MANE OF A DIFFERENT COLOR, IT'S TIME FOR A WIG 
</P>

 Renate Leuschner handles hair the way a grocer handles fresh endive, the way a 
haberdasher fingers Italian silk. Each time her supplier receives a new 
shipment of human hair, in cropped bundles, she hurries down to pick through 
the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best hair comes from poor countries where the women still wear it long 
and will sell it," Leuschner says. "These women get paid almost nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Some strands are too thick and difficult to weave. Dark hair must be 
chemically treated, bleached and dyed, making it stiff. Only fine brown and 
blond locks from Eastern Europe suffice. 
</P>
<P>
 This stock ends up, sorted by length and color, in clear plastic containers 
that line the shelves of Leuschner's Burbank studio. And this is where 
well-known actors come when they need a wig to make them look curly or sexy or 
prim, when they need a wig to look like they were born on a different continent 
or in a different era. 
</P>
<P>
 In this tiny workshop -- down the driveway, through the back yard and above a 
three-car garage -- Hollywood's fantasies are reduced to the stuff of their 
facades. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Stone amounts to nothing more than a pile of brown and blond bundles. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Williams is a dummy's head, carefully measured, made of gray cloth and 
featureless. 
</P>
<P>
 "And big," Leuschner says. "Robin, even for a man, has a big head." 
</P>
<P>
 Theater and wigs share a long history. Greek characters marked themselves by 
the color of their coif: black for the tyrant, blond for the hero and red for 
the comic servant. Modern actors don wigs to protect their natural hair from 
stage lights and to avoid the damage of continual cutting, styling and coloring 
with each new role. 
</P>
<P>
 The hairpieces they purchase from Leuschner are custom-fitted and hand-sewn, 
strand by strand, at a price of $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning, the wig-maker and her two young assistants, Natascha and 
Hildegard, hurried to finish an order of seven wigs for a fashion show. The 
girls were sewing while their mentor brushed and clipped a completed piece. 
There was very little talk, all of it in thick accents, while insistent Chopin 
played from a stereo in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Scissors and combs lay scattered about the place, along with gray head forms. 
In addition to the Williams facsimile, used for his "Mrs. Doubtfire" curls, 
there were faceless likenesses of Bette Midler, Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise, 
who needed a wig for "Interview With a Vampire." Demi Moore was there -- in 
form -- too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tiny head," she says. "You can hardly mistake her for anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 The names of actors mark many of the containers on the shelves: Ann-Margret, 
Melanie Griffith, Carol Burnett. Other containers are noted by color: "Light 
blond to medium light blond." 
</P>
<P>
 Each wig that Leuschner makes begins with a fitting session, during which she 
measures the actor's head and takes note of his or her facial features. 
</P>
<P>
 Perfectly even hairlines are good. Wide foreheads are bad. Oval faces, yes. 
Round faces, no. Cher, it seems, was put on this earth to wear a wig. 
</P>
<P>
 Next comes a form-fitting lace cap, the edges of which can be blended into 
skin with makeup. Hair is sewn into this cap in much the same way a rug is 
hooked, one strand at a time in front and several at a time in back. 
</P>
<P>
 To look real, a wig must include strands of various shades and the roots must 
be darker than the ends. A brown wig, for example, will contain a quantity of 
brown hair as a base, with darker and lighter strands to provide the 
highlights. But before the sewing begins, a sample of the hair must be 
screen-tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Bright lights and camera filters can alter hue. When Bette Midler was cast as 
a witch in the 1993 film "Hocus Pocus," she ordered a red wig from Leuschner. 
Midler's scenes were shot in dim lighting to simulate night and a truly red wig 
would have shown up purple on film. Renate used strands that were dyed 
fire-engine red and orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the color is perfected, the hair is sewn onto its lace cap. This can take 
a week or more and is often performed by the assistants. "I like hair," 
Hildegard says. Then Leuschner must return to the movie set to fine-tune the 
styling. For "Mrs. Doubtfire," the fine-tuning required numerous visits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to adjust certain things to make him look feminine and not like a drag 
queen," she says. "Honestly, it wasn't easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Trained as a stylist in her native Germany, she came to Hollywood and grabbed 
the only job she could find, in a wig shop. In 1972, she was hired to work on 
"The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour" which, short of garnering an exclusive 
contract with Dolly Parton, was pretty much the Valhalla of wig-making. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've made 100, maybe 120 wigs for Cher over the years," Leuschner explains. 
"She has always been my major client. And when I was doing that show, everyone 
wanted to look like Cher, so that's how my business got started." 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven years ago, she gathered a large enough clientele to open shop behind 
the Spanish-style house she shares with her husband, an engineer, in the 
foothills of the Verdugo Mountains. Clients must walk past her barking dogs, 
one of which bites and is locked in the house when visitors are due.  
</P>
<P>
 And it does not matter if her customers are charismatic or quirky, if they act 
charming or difficult, as celebrities are sometimes wont to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have to deal with difficulties in people, only with the difficulties 
in the shape of their heads," she explains, brushing a newly woven thresh of 
blond locks, clipping and styling to create a Marilyn Monroe look. "I get the 
easy part of that bargain."

THE STYLE FILES: THE PICTURES; A SILENT PARTNER; WHAT BECOMES A HOLLYWOOD 
LEGEND MOST? STYLIST VIVIAN TURNER MAKES THE STARS SHINE, THEN BOWS OUT OF THE 
PICTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Perhaps no other profession in the world requires you to show up for work 
bringing your own bags of dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Vivian Turner's does. As a wardrobe stylist to the stars, she works in one of 
Hollywood's quirkiest professions. She must be able to size up a celebrity, 
shop for clothes and arrive on a set with everything necessary to make him or 
her look great. She's part miracle worker, part invisible woman, part lingerie 
expert, part best friend. 
</P>
<P>
 And yes, she brings her own dirt. It's actually Fuller's Earth, a powdered 
stone in different shades used to age clothing on the spot, and it's just one 
of a dozen items in her bag of tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner has put Christian Slater in young hunk clothes to host the MTV awards, 
to shoot editorial layouts and meet the press. Geena Davis wore her choice of 
sexy ruffles for the February cover of Premiere magazine. Turner dressed Axl 
Rose in wedding-day finery for his elaborate "November Rain" video. In nine 
years of styling, she's always been on target, never once having the star or 
director reject everything on her wardrobe rack. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's secret for success, says Susan Culley, head of Susan Culley & 
Associates, which represents Slater, is that you can't tell she was there.  
</P>
<P>
 "Celebrities want to look like themselves," says Culley, "and a lot of 
stylists pull things that the celebrity would not wear. Vivian has this 
incredible knack for picking things out that the client and the magazine both 
love."  
</P>
<P>
 Her career began when, as a favor to her boyfriend, Turner prepared some 
clothes for bands he represented. 
</P>
<P>
 One member, Charlie Sexton, was to go in front of the camera of top 
photographer Greg Gorman, who noticed the ease with which Turner clothed the 
singer. Gorman asked her to come the next day and help out with Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, and the day after that with Alexander Godunov. The next day the 
photographer asked Turner to be his in-house stylist. Turner now works 
free-lance through the Cloutier Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started at the top and I didn't have the background," says Turner. "I 
didn't even know what Topstick was." (That's the double-stick toupee tape used 
between the star and the strapless gown so the gown stays up.)  
</P>
<P>
 "We did a shoot with Keanu Reeves last year and he's not known for doing, or 
enjoying, photo sessions," says Gorman, recalling one of the biggest challenges 
the two faced together. "She put him in a dozen changes and it was amazing. The 
clothes made him feel comfortable and he was incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 For "The Hideaway," the modern-day thriller Jeff Goldblum is now shooting in 
Vancouver, the clothes-savvy star requested that Turner design and style his 
costumes. One recent prep day she presented him with a rack of Calvin Klein, 
Industria, Donna Karan and custom-made shirts, jackets and pants for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's brilliant," Goldblum says simply. "She's great and she's got great 
ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 "Vivian tells people 'This is what your needs are,' and she says it in an 
inoffensive way," says Maxfield sales manager Janet Gaertner, who's always 
happy to see Turner coming in the door. People respect this honesty, says 
Gaertner. "I'll see Vivian shopping with an actress again after the film is 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 "You're working with individuals, and there's something that makes them who 
they are. You tap into that," says Turner. "You enhance a personality, not take 
it away." 
</P>
<P>
 After "The Hideaway," Turner's next challenge is to dress clients heading to 
the Oscars. Those who saw the Golden Globe Awards as an indicator of this 
year's Academy Awards' dress code would be mistaken, she says. The Globes' 
toned-down mood was due partly to the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Globes, Turner dressed Stockard Channing in a black Armani suit and 
Laura Dern in a fitted black brocade dress by Pamela Barish, the new young 
California designer currently hot among the Hollywood chic.  
</P>
<P>
 Anything actresses wore to the Globes are, of course, "used up," she says, and 
won't be picked again. There were, however, lessons to be learned: 
</P>
<P>
 * A bust-squashing bustier dress on Penelope Ann Miller was "unattractive," 
while Natasha Richardson's strapless Giorgio Armani "looked great." The 
difference is in the construction. "Strapless gowns are hard to wear. Women tug 
on them and that looks so bad. If something looks uncomfortable, it usually is 
uncomfortable."  
</P>
<P>
 * Janine Turner's white bra under a sheer dress was another error. "You wonder 
sometimes what a person was thinking. Her bra was going to become invisible 
when it was lit?" 
</P>
<P>
 * Joan Chen, Winona Ryder, Vivian Wu and Kate Capshaw were among those who had 
elegance and style. On the other hand, "poor Juliette Lewis is a mess," says 
Turner, referring to the oddball Cleopatra headgear the actress chose for the 
evening. "She needs a stylist in the worst way. The weird stuff doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 The stylist predicts Oscar night will bring out plenty of Armani, as usual, 
along with a good amount of Richard Tyler and a smattering of Pamela Barish. 
Versace will make a play, but she says his clothes are for perfect women, and 
therefore intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actresses are real women," Turner says. "Most of them aren't models, they're 
not 6 feet tall, they don't have bodies like Stephanie Seymour." It's best, she 
says, to figure out what they do have and work around that.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, "Bette Midler has great cleavage and beautiful legs, but she's 
tiny, like 4-foot-11. So she looks gorgeous in short dresses with great 
necklines." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's stamp is one of understatement. Not too much jewelry. Not too much of 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simple is the most beautiful. Ostentatiousness is not what people are about 
now. I don't use big earrings and lots of stuff unless it's necessary. You need 
to know when to stop."

CELEBS BOUND FOR THE SPOTLIGHT.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 HOLLY HUNTER 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard Tyler, with nothing underneath. I see her in almost a tuxedo. 
Something tailored and understated because she's the underdog.She shouldn't be 
in cleavage." 
</P>
<P>
 EMMA THOMPSON 
</P>
<P>
 "A beautiful beaded white suit by Armani. Very clean and pure. The color is in 
the hair and makeup. If she tried to do more with herself, she would seem 
costumed." 
</P>
<P>
 ANGELA BASSETT 
</P>
<P>
 "A sexy Herve Leger banded dress in white or a great color like red or pink. 
Very fitted. Full length. With her muscles, an evening gown would not be 
right."  
</P>
<P>
 DEBRA WINGER 
</P>
<P>
 "A white silk suit with Hepburn trousers. Flowing, but not too voluminous. 
Someone very simple, classic. Hair blown straight or swept back in a chignon." 
</P>
<P>
 STOCKARD CHANNING 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely the bad girl in a suit look. I would show some leg with a short 
skirt. Fitted jacket with lots of cleavage." 
</P>
<P>
 WINONA RYDER 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd do one of Pamela Barish's Audrey Hepburn cocktail dresses. A fitted 
sheath with a deep neckline. Hemline below the knee. Pink with little black 
gloves, black shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 ROSIE PEREZ 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd put her in a Dolce & Gabbana, something fun and funky. Maybe one of their 
chiffon slip dresses. She's not a glamour girl." 
</P>
<P>
 ANNA PAQUIN 
</P>
<P>
 "I want her to look like a traditional little girl. Red velvet dress, classic 
white tights and patent Mary Janes. Innocent and as childlike as possible, not 
even remotely grown up."

THE STYLE FILES: THE PICTURES; THE TRUNK SHOW; WHEN DESIGNER CHIC MEETS K MART, 
THE RESULT IS 'THE NANNY'S' COLORFUL WARDROBE. IT'S OUTRAGEOUS, OVER-THE-TOP -- 
AND DEFINITELY UNFORGETTABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's late on a Wednesday afternoon at the Culver Studios in Culver City. 
Actress Fran Drescher, star of the CBS sitcom, "The Nanny," huddles with 
costume designer Brenda Cooper in a wardrobe room filled with shopping bags, 
purses, hats, sketches, Polaroids, scripts, dangling earrings and racks of 
leopard-spotted clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Drescher, dressed in a white brocade Dolce & Gabbana pantsuit with white 
Stephane Kelian mules, and Cooper, in pleated pants and a '40s thrift-store 
blouse, are concocting a tarty ensemble for Drescher's character -- and alter 
ego -- Fran Fine to wear on a fictitious Caribbean cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A nanny who's a glamour puss from Queens taking care of an upper-crust British 
family was Drescher's idea. And much of the show's humor comes from Drescher's 
character's outrageous wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 She's "the lady in red while everyone else is wearing tan," go the theme 
song's lyrics. In a single episode Drescher has as many wardrobe changes as 
Princess Di goes through in a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by the fan mail, "The Nanny's" over-the-top outfits are as big a hit 
as the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sometimes forget what the show is about," says one L.A. stylist, "but I 
never forget the clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 Drescher says when people stop her on the street for her autograph, they also 
want to know where she buys her clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer: everywhere from K mart to Neiman Marcus. Cooper relies on 
Drescher's favorite labels -- Todd Oldham, Norma Kamali, Moschino and Dolce & 
Gabbana -- for her main labels. But she has stumbled on the unexpected item at 
resale stores, thrift shops and garage sales. A recent thrill was finding a 
pale blue jacket with matching fur trim at Loehmann's. 
</P>
<P>
 "We use a lot of Moschino and Todd Oldham because they have a sense of humor," 
says Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a silk patchwork robe Drescher tries on during this afternoon fitting 
is a gift from Oldham; it's made entirely of fabric squares from past designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Drescher says when she wears Oldham's theatrical designs off camera, "the 
photographers have a field day." 
</P>
<P>
 The actress appears statuesque on camera, despite the fact that she wears only 
a Size 2 or Size 4. Perhaps it's the New Yawk drawl -- or her over-the-top 
portrayals of characters in films like "This Is Spinal Tap," "Cadillac Man" and 
"The Big Picture" -- that make Drescher loom large. 
</P>
<P>
 It was on the ill-fated CBS series "Princesses" -- co-starring Twiggy and 
Julie Haggerty -- that Drescher met Brenda Cooper. The costume designer helped 
Drescher define Fran Fine's image, which is, as one critic put it, "Funny Girl" 
meets "The Sound of Music." 
</P>
<P>
 The prototypal "Nanny" suit consists of a bright Moschino jacket (from the 
Cheap and Chic collection) worn over a black spandex, mock turtleneck top and 
black spandex miniskirt. And always, always, sexy high heels. The original 
"Nanny" shoe was a 4 1/2-inch pump by Charles Jourdan. Then Cooper found copies 
at J.C. Penney for $50 a pair. She bought all the shoes the store had in 
Drescher's size and, each episode, she dyes them to match. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper fits Drescher in a sarong she's fashioned from a swath of crushed 
velvet from International Silks and Woolens, a black crushed velvet 
midriff-baring top and black capri leggings. The two women examine the finished 
product in a full-length mirror. Something's missing. . . . Ahhh, oversized 
tropical fruit earrings. The Nanny meets Carmen Miranda.
