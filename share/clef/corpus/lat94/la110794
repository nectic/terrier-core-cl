 WORLD WAR I: Many people have lied to get out of serving in the Army. Milton 
Gates lied to get in. Only 16, he desperately wanted to fight in World War I. 
So he said he was 18. "My brother was going over to fight and I wanted to go 
too," said Gates, 94, of Reseda. . . . By the time Gates arrived in France, 
however, the "war to end all wars" was history. Its lasting legacy was Veterans 
Day, which is this Friday -- "the 11th day of the 11th month," when the 
slaughter ended at the 11th hour. 
</P>
<P>
 WORLD WAR II: Of course, the war to end all wars had a sequel. And Ted Fleser, 
72, of Woodland Hills, was there, a ranger in the invasions of German-held 
North Africa and Italy. For Fleser, the rightness of the cause was never in 
doubt. "It was the last of the good wars," Fleser says. "We felt we were 
morally right and all that sort of stuff. Vietnam and Korea were police 
actions." 
</P>
<P>
 KOREAN WAR: Police action? Don't whisper the words to Wallace Pohring (above), 
who saw that conflict as an important battleground against an aggressive 
tyranny. "Communism was a big threat. South Korea was being overrun," said 
Pohring, 62, of West Hills. "Korea was also the first real battle that the U.N. 
was involved with. I had a good feeling because it was a joint effort." 
</P>
<P>
 VIETNAM WAR: Don't expect that kind of loyalty from John Enders -- he was in 
Vietnam. Enders, 53, of Canoga Park, was a big believer in the U.S. cause 
during the war's early days. But, as the anti-war movement intensified in the 
late '60s, Enders changed his mind. "We should never have been there," he says. 
"We just poked our nose where we didn't belong." 
</P>
<P>
 DESERT STORM: Well, we sure belonged in Kuwait, says Mary Carpenter, 60, of 
Sylmar, a Navy reserve senior chief petty officer during the Persian Gulf 
conflict, handling paperwork in Point Mugu. . . . Carpenter, however, isn't 
entirely satisfied with the results. "If we need to go back, we have to do it 
without restrictions," she said. Translation: The U.S. still has to get rid of 
Saddam Hussein. Michael Arkush

NO OFFENSE, BUT RAIDERS NEED IT; PRO FOOTBALL: THEY CAN'T GET ANYTHING GOING IN 
13-3 LOSS TO CHIEFS, RUINING A CHANCE TO MOVE UP IN STANDINGS.

 It began with an interception. 
</P>
<P>
 It ended with an interception. 
</P>
<P>
 And it didn't get any better in between. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders spent 60 miserable, frustrating, mistake-filled minutes Sunday 
night at Arrowhead Stadium trying unsuccessfully to get into the end zone. 
Instead, they might gotten themselves out of playoff contention in losing to 
the Kansas City Chiefs, 13-3, before a delighted crowd of 78,709 that came to 
boo Harvey Williams and wound up cheering their own side. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you lose you can come up with 102 excuses," receiver Tim Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Raiders came up with what seemed like 102 ways to self-destruct. 
</P>
<P>
 Interceptions, insufficient blocking, false starts, enough penalty flags to 
wave any chance of victory goodby, conservative play-calling and missed field 
goals. You name it, they did it. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Raiders took the field Sunday, they found before them a ladder of 
opportunity to climb back into the playoff hunt despite having started the 
season 1-3. The AFC West-leading San Diego Chargers had lost earlier in the day 
to drop to 7-2. The second-place Chiefs were only a game ahead of the Raiders 
at 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
 By losing, however, the Raiders fall to 4-5 with seven games to play, that 
ladder looking more like a mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? 
</P>
<P>
 -- What happened to the vaunted Raider receiving corps? The team had assembled 
enough speed among pass-catchers to field a track squad. But quarterback Jeff 
Hostetler has chosen to hand the baton to only one man, Tim Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown caught six passes Sunday, but no other wide receiver caught a ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Season scorecard: Brown, 50 catches. Rest of the wide receivers, 33. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, double-covered much of the evening, said the coaching staff discussed 
"going to the other side," but nothing materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 -- What happened to Hostetler's reputation for making the smart throw and 
avoiding the interception whenever possible? 
</P>
<P>
 He admitted after Sunday's game that he has gotten out of character in an 
effort to single-handedly try to salvage an offense that has become one in name 
only. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm probably forcing some things," he said. "I'm trying to make the big play 
and I'm not helping." 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler and Brown tried to make a big play on the opening play from 
scrimmage, thus sending a message to the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a message that was delivered to the wrong person. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler fired a bomb to Brown streaking down the right side. Over came free 
safety William White to pick it off. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler had thrown a career-high 10 interceptions last season. He threw a 
pair Sunday to give him 11 for this year with seven games to go. 
</P>
<P>
 And it could have been worse. Under heavy pressure on his second series of the 
game, Hostetler foolishly threw a ball that defensive end Darren Mickell picked 
off for an apparent interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, for one of the few times on a night when they were penalized 15 times 
for 115 yards, the Raiders welcomed the flag. A false start by right tackle 
Greg Skrepenak before the snap nullified the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler was lucky again in the third quarter. A pass intended for Brown -- 
of course -- found its way into the arms of defensive back David Whitmore after 
Brown slipped on the grass. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing the end zone about 25 yards away, Whitmore had a clear field. 
</P>
<P>
 But not the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 It bounced out of his overeager hands, keeping the Raiders temporarily alive. 
</P>
<P>
 -- What happened to the Raider offensive line? 
</P>
<P>
 That line surrendered five sacks to the onrushing Chiefs, led by Neil Smith's 
pair, and was guilty of seven false starts along with a couple of holding calls 
and one for illegal motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Skrepenak, in the lineup the past three weeks as a starter for the first time, 
was guilty of three of those false starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to Arrowhead Stadium, where the noise level sometimes seems to match 
that at nearby Kansas City International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't hear," Skrepenak said. "It was my first time playing here. I knew 
the plays. I just couldn't hear the snap count. For an offensive lineman, that 
is one of your biggest advantages. There were some immature mistakes on my 
part." 
</P>
<P>
 -- What happened to the Raider offense at the end of the first half? 
</P>
<P>
 In the first 30 minutes, the Chiefs took a 7-3 lead, Joe Montana's 57-yard 
touchdown pass to tight end Derrick Walker being the only touchdown of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raider offense consisted of a 50-yard field goal by Jeff Jaeger. He also 
missed from 33 and 44 yards. The 33-yard miss came after he connected from 28 
yards, but that kick was nullified by -- what else? -- a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 But with 1:49 to play before intermission and the ball on the Raider 27, Coach 
Art Shell chose to play conservatively, calling for four Williams runs and only 
one pass on a drive that fizzled at the Raider 44, Jeff Gossett punting to 
close out the half. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a lack of confidence," Shell insisted. "You've got to be smart about 
the things that you do. We were going into the half down, 7-3. I'll take that." 
</P>
<P>
 With his offense, that's understandable if not acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 That offense wasn't heard from in the second half, the only points were scored 
by Kansas City's Lin Elliott, who kicked field goals of 19 and 27 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams celebrated his return to the team he played for the past three 
seasons by gaining a game-high 93 yards in 24 carries. But he was hardly in a 
celebrating mood. 
</P>
<P>
 So what now for the Raiders? 
</P>
<P>
 "Win," defensive lineman Nolan Harrison said. "We've tried everything else. We 
might try winning. That might help." Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Raider defensive backs Derrick Hoskins (ankle) and Albert Lewis (knee) were 
knocked out of the game. No word was given on the seriousness of those 
injuries. . . . The Raiders play the Rams next Sunday at Anaheim Stadium.

RAMS DON'T LET ELWAY DRILL THEM; PRO FOOTBALL: QUARTERBACK BRINGS BRONCOS BACK 
FROM 21-POINT DEFICIT, BUT RALLY COMES UP SHORT, 27-21. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Rams were leading by 21 points Sunday in Anaheim Stadium, and linebacker 
Shane Conlan admitted, "I was nervous as hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Time remained on the clock and John Elway was still in the stadium, pitching 
footballs and rallying the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was I nervous? What a crazy question," Ram defensive end Robert Young said. 
"Wouldn't you be nervous if the greatest comeback player in the game had the 
ball in his hands?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos scored three times, and with 2:28 to play, the Rams were hanging 
onto a six-point lead. Elway had the ball at the Rams' 49-yard line with a 
chance to direct his 26th fourth-quarter game-winning drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Four times he took aim at the Ram defense, and four times the Ram defense 
fought off the magic, taking the ball back on downs and securing a 27-21 
victory before 48,103. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thank God we survived," defensive end Fred Stokes said. "They ought to 
present T-shirts to every team that can say, 'I survived the John Elway 
two-minute drill.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Elway's pass on fourth and seven from the Ram 46 went to a diving Shannon 
Sharpe at the 38, good for a first down. But as Sharpe jumped to his feet, the 
ball in his hands, the official ruled the pass incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I made a good catch," Sharpe said. "He (the official) was on top of 
the play, so he had the position to make a good call. He probably did, but I 
didn't feel the ball hit the ground. I'll have to see the replay." 
</P>
<P>
 Bronco Coach Wade Phillips, who watched the play unfold directly in front of 
him, protested loudly on the field, but gained no satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he caught the ball," Phillips said. "The official told me right 
away that the ground can't help you catch a ball." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams -- whether they witnessed the play or not -- were unanimous in their 
call: He didn't catch the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not lying," safety Anthony Newman said. "I would have said, 'Aw, we got 
licked on that one.' But it hit the ground without a doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 The incomplete pass snuffed the Denver rally. The Broncos got the ball back 
with five seconds to play, but they were 89 yards from the end zone and out of 
timeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the first time I felt good," Stokes said. "He had five seconds, but I 
didn't think even he could go that far in that amount of time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams blew an opportunity to deliver a knockout punch and curtail the Elway 
comeback effort midway through the fourth quarter when running back Jerome 
Bettis was stopped three consecutive times at the Broncos' one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in the stadium knew Jerome was going to get the ball," said an 
irritated Troy Drayton, Ram tight end. "I wanted a pass called because they 
were packed in to stop the run." 
</P>
<P>
 A pass had been called on second down, but Ram quarterback Chris Chandler said 
the audio apparatus in his helmet malfunctioned and he misinterpreted the 
signal coming in from the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they were ready to fold up at that point," cornerback Todd Lyght 
said. "But when we didn't score a touchdown there, they got momentum." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams settled for an 18-yard field goal by Tony Zendejas to extend their 
lead to 27-14 with 8:36 to play, and Elway was back on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today could have been very ugly," cornerback Darryl Henley said. "We could 
easily be sitting here, mad and talking about what we needed to do better to 
win next week. That's what I hate the most: coming in here and having to hear 
Chuck Knox's same speech: 'You didn't get it done.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, however, did get it done, and thanks in part to a quick start after 
a bye week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams (4-5) scored three touchdowns on offense for the first time in 19 
games, Chandler established himself as the team's starting quarterback and 
Zendejas ran his streak of consecutive field goals to 12 with a pair of kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the Rams limited Denver to 60 yards of offense in the first half, when 
Elway completed only seven of 17 passes for 40 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, who replaced Miller as the starting quarterback because of Miller's 
lingering concussion, left in the fourth quarter after suffering his own knock 
on the head. He completed 19 of 25 passes for 223 yards, including touchdown 
passes of three yards to Howard Griffith and 30 yards to Flipper Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver safety Steve Atwater went helmet to helmet with Chandler on the goal 
line on the Rams' opening series in the second half, and Chandler said he began 
to feel sluggish as the game continued. He played until midway in the fourth 
quarter, when he said he began having difficulty following the Bronco defense 
and throwing the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller relieved and completed three of four passes for 21 yards, but the game 
rested on the battle between Elway and the Ram defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We blew a chance to have three more victories by losing games like this," 
linebacker Joe Kelly said. "That's why this win is so important to us: We can 
hang in there, and we did it against one of the best in the game."

A WRONG TURN IS NOT ENOUGH TO DERAIL SILVA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As German Silva turned onto 59th Street at the south end of Central Park on 
Sunday, two policemen yelled at him as if he had ignored a Do Not Enter sign. 
</P>
<P>
 He had. 
</P>
<P>
 With less than half a mile to go in the 25th New York City Marathon, Silva, 
running in lock step with co-leader Benjamin Paredes, turned right when he 
should have gone straight. By the time Silva realized what he had done, Paredes 
had a 60-yard lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a comeback that put him on highlight reels instead of blooper tapes, 
Silva caught and passed Paredes, winning by two seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Tegla Loroupe of Kenya could have made a wrong turn into New Jersey and won 
the women's division. Her time of 2 hours 27 minutes 37 seconds was more than 
two minutes faster than runner-up Madina Biktagirova of Russia, with Anne Marie 
Letko of Glen Gardner, N.J., third. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva's victory came in 2:11:21, relatively slow because of warm and humid 
conditions that medical personnel said contributed to the death of two runners 
because of heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican's victory over countryman Paredes was the closest finish in race 
history. Former Mexican teammate and now U.S. citizen Arturo Barrios was third 
in 2:11:43 after leading in the 24th mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva, a brash 26-year-old, had said last week that the rest of the 
27,000-plus runner field was competing for second place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said something, and then I had to do what I said," he said Sunday. But he 
made it difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 In only his third marathon, he ran with the lead pack that included up to 21 
men all day, seldom leading, but never far from it. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrios held or was close to the lead for eight miles from the midway point 
while Silva and Paredes paced each other, passing water cups back and forth. 
They ran shoulder-to-shoulder into the final moments of the 26-mile, 385-yard 
race. Barrios tried one more challenge, taking the lead in about the 24th mile. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was determined to push the pace and if they were going to beat me, they 
were going to have to pay the price," Barrios said. When Silva and Paredes 
responded, Barrios was done. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva almost was too. 
</P>
<P>
 At the corner of 7th Avenue and 59th Street, there is an escape route for 
vehicles, mostly those carrying the media. "I was very concentrated on my 
pace," Silva said. "I don't know exactly what happened, but I went to the right 
and I thought (Paredes) was going with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Paredes glanced right, got a horrified look on his face and did what 
came naturally -- ran faster. 
</P>
<P>
 A New York police officer at the intersection gestured wildly to Silva with 
both hands, and another in a raincoat a few steps up 59th Street did the same. 
Silva said he didn't see them, but he did "see the faces of the people. I knew 
then I did something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 He stopped, went back up 59th and turned onto West Drive, more than 60 yards 
behind Paredes. "I was thinking, it is more than 400 meters (left to run), so 
maybe I can catch him," Silva said. "Even if I can't catch him, I could push 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 He did better than that. Going uphill, he took the lead less than 400 yards 
from the finish line, getting a pat on the back from Paredes while going past. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva, whose father wanted him to give up running and work in the orange 
groves, is the bad boy of Mexican runners, twice being suspended for defying 
the country's track and field federation. Mexican runners owe him a debt 
because his legal challenge to the body means that he has to turn over only 7% 
of the $20,000, plus a Mercedes-Benz, he earned for winning Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Loroupe, a 21-year-old postal worker in Kenya, matched that prize for winning 
the first marathon she has ever run. 
</P>
<P>
 An animated sort who smiles and chatters incessantly, she laid off the lead, 
which was held by 1994 L.A. Marathon winner Olga Appell through the early 
stages. Loroupe took over in the 19th mile and looked back only after crossing 
the finish line. There were no women in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Appell, who developed blisters, was seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is important for me, for my family and for my tribe," Loroupe said. A 
Bitok, she added that she also has had trouble with Kenya's track and field 
federation, charging them with indifference to her tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 She ran eight kilometers to school as a youth. "I didn't know I was training 
then," she said. "I only know they would cane me if I was late." 
</P>
<P>
 She was early enough Sunday.

NEAR END, NAVRATILOVA DENIED; TENNIS: IN HER SECOND-TO-LAST TOURNAMENT, SHE 
LOSES TO SANCHEZ VICARIO IN OAKLAND FINAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART SPANDER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a week of contrasts and of triumph, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario began by 
answering the threat of the future and finished by responding to the challenge 
of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 After eliminating 14-year-old Venus Williams in her first professional tennis 
match Wednesday, Sanchez Vicario overcame her own indifferent play and a 
partisan crowd to defeat 38-year-old Martina Navratilova, 1-6, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 
(7-3), Sunday in the final of the Bank of the West Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova, who is scheduled to play in one more event, the Virginia Slims 
Championships, before taking her leave from women's singles, was two points 
from the victory in the final set. 
</P>
<P>
 But her years and Sanchez Vicario's powerful forehand would not let 
Navratilova add one more to her record of 167 victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had so many opportunities," sighed Navratilova, "but she always came up 
with the goods." 
</P>
<P>
 For Navratilova, in the 239th final match of a career that began in 1975, or 
when Sanchez Vicario was 3 years old, it was a bittersweet afternoon at Oakland 
Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd of 7,098 was on her side, but her serves and volleys betrayed her. 
And Sanchez Vicario, winning her 21st consecutive match, was no help either 
after the first set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hadn't played tennis like that in a long time," Navratilova said. "Not this 
year, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Not even at Wimbledon, where Martina reached the final against Sanchez 
Vicario's countrywoman from Spain, Conchita Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sentiment was with me, of course," Navratilova said. "They'll get to 
watch Arantxa many, many times. They should all root for a player who's about 
to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 "But she is a great scrambler. She keeps fighting no matter what. When I was 
up, 4-1, in the second set I didn't hit the serves hard enough. And there were 
times she hit great returns. Her win was more her doing than mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Winner of two of this year's Grand Slam events, the French and U.S. Opens, 
Sanchez Vicario said she wobbled a bit early in the match because of weariness. 
"After the doubles semifinals Saturday night I got to bed at 1 a.m. and got 
five hours' sleep," Sanchez Vicario said. "I was not moving well. But I never 
give up. And I'm strong mentally." 
</P>
<P>
 She had to be. The fans were against her in the Williams match. And they were 
against her in the Navratilova match. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think the first match helps me for today," said Sanchez Vicario, who 
earned $40,000 after her eighth tournament victory of 1994. "I win that match 
and it give me the confidence. I had not played in a month. There were a lot of 
things going the other way." 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly the audience.

 "I first played in the Bay Area in 1975 when this tournament was at (San 
Francisco) Civic Auditorium," Navratilova said. "I had my first big win. I beat 
Nancy Richey. I lost to Chris Evert in the semifinal." 
</P>
<P>
 Her play this week did not inspire Navratilova to make one more trip around 
the circuit and the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no desire to play next year," she said. "I really don't. But I didn't 
play this kind of tennis for a long time. So it's, 'Oh, my God, look at this 
shot I hit.' It's like 10 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago she probably wouldn't have lost tiebreakers in the second and 
third sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year has not been very satisfying," Navratilova said. "At least here I 
got to have a proper goodby. In Los Angeles I lost early. In Eastbourne I lost 
early. Chicago I lost in the quarters. Those are cities that really meant a lot 
to me. I played horrible tennis. It's been a very frustrating year."

MORNING BRIEFING: SILVER AND GOLD HELP CHI CHI KEEP HIS HEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chi Chi Rodriguez will be grand marshal of the Rose Bowl parade, and if he 
plays golf with Tournament of Roses officials during the holidays, he'll have a 
quarter, a buffalo nickel and a gold piece in his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very superstitious," he said. "I think everyone is a little 
superstitious, they just don't want to admit it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez marks his ball for birdie putts with a quarter, but if the quarter 
isn't working, he switches to the gold piece. The buffalo nickel is for pars 
and eagles. Whichever coin he uses, he always marks it heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who was the first New York City Marathon winner? 
</P>
<P>
 One man's opinion: Attention Jeff Bagwell, Matt Williams and Moises Alou. 
</P>
<P>
 Said agent Dennis Gilbert, who is livid that Barry Bonds finished fourth in 
the National League MVP balloting: "The MVP vote was a popularity contest, not 
anything based on performance. For Barry Bonds to finish fourth is completely 
inappropriate. The writers should be completely embarrassed. It's a travesty." 
</P>
<P>
 Move over, Michael: Cricket fans in many Indian cities sobbed and beat their 
chests in grief at news that the world's highest Test wicket taker, Kapil Dev, 
had retired. "This can't be true, Indian cricket without Kapil?" asked Suraj 
Bhatnagar of New Delhi. In Calcutta, residents paraded through the streets 
carrying Dev's photograph festooned with marigold garlands and shouted, "We 
Love You, Kapil." 
</P>
<P>
 Tough sports: Jimmy Hudson, who attended Pima College in Arizona on a rodeo 
scholarship and later turned to racing stock cars, compared the two: "Rodeo is 
a little harder than racing a car. There's no seat belt and no helmet." 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble sleeping?The Amateur Athletic Foundation's SportsLetter has a 
suggestion for insomniacs -- an article in Journal of Sports Sciences titled: 
"The influence of electrostimulation on mechanical and morphological 
characteristics of the triceps surae." 
</P>
<P>
 Always thinking: When Ian Baker-Finch stripped to his underwear to wade into a 
lake to hit a shot during a PGA Tour event, his playing partner, Nick Price, 
said, "If I was his manager I'd be on the phone to Jockey or Fruit of the 
Loom." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Baker-Finch: According to Golf Digest, when Baker-Finch reached the next 
hole, a group of female spectators encouraged him to hit another ball in the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Gary Muhrcke, a New York firefighter, in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Everything: It's no surprise Jerry Rice holds Mississippi Valley State 
records for touchdowns, points scored, receiving yardage and passes caught -- 
but the 49er wide receiver also holds the school record for the longest 
touchdown on a running play, 86 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Sportscaster Al Trautwig, during a Little League World Series game 
on ABC-TV: "This is the kind of event you'd miss if you couldn't get here."

 Kevin Johnson, who had 29 points, broke Phoenix's cold spell with a 20-foot 
jumper late in the game, and the Suns continued their mastery of the Miami Heat 
with a 119-107 victory Sunday night.

<P>
 Rookie Wesley Person, who scored four points Friday night when Sacramento 
defeated the Suns 107-89, hit seven of 11 shots and finished with 23 points. 
Dan Majerle had 20 points and a career-high 15 rebounds for the Suns.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If sports ever needed a feel-good story, it is now. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 You know, something to take our minds off strikes, lockouts, police blotters 
and courtrooms. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 George Foreman delivered it when he regained the heavyweight championship 20 
years after losing it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman has been involved in three of the most incredible prizefights ever. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 He knocked Joe Frazier down six times in Kingston, Jamaica, on Jan. 22, 1973, 
and won the title in the second round. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He hammered Muhammad Ali for seven rounds in Kinshasa, Zaire, on Oct. 30, 
1974, before being knocked out in the eighth. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He knocked out Michael Moorer in the 10th on Saturday in Las Vegas after being 
outboxed and outpunched for nine rounds. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Conventional wisdom was that Foreman's only chance was to flatten Moorer early 
with a left hook. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he finished the job with a straight right in the 29th minute. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his comeback, George had thrown the right hand like, well, a 
45-year-old. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 His most effective weapons had been the left jab and hook. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Against Moorer in the early rounds, he pawed with the jab rather than firing 
it. HBO didn't need to replay his punches in slow motion. They were slow 
motion. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How judge Duane Ford gave Foreman four of the first six rounds is 
inexplicable. I gave him only the fourth. Judges Jerry Roth and Chuck Giampa 
each gave him the second and fourth. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But Foreman kept to his task. His determination never wavered. By the eighth, 
he was starting to land some stinging, though not overpowering, right hands. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 The key was conditioning. As late as two days before the fight, he sparred 12 
rounds. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He never sat on his stool Saturday and never drank water, although a bottle 
was offered to him between every round. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Move to your right!" Angelo Dundee kept yelling at him during the action. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 "Circle to your right and stay away from his right," Teddy Atlas kept telling 
Moorer during the one-minute rest periods. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It was the old one-two, a jab to the head and a straight right to the jaw, 
that sent Moorer to the canvas and 12,000 fans into shock. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Among those watching was Ingemar Johansson, a commentator for the Scandinavian 
telecast. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "It was wonderful," said Johansson, whose toonderbolts won him the title 
against heavy favorite Floyd Patterson in 1959. "The right hand is the best 
punch you can throw." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer wasn't the only person to hit the deck. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 George's brother Roy fainted from the excitement, and publicist Bill Caplan 
was knocked down by a security guard. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to climb into the ring when the count got to three," Caplan said. "I 
knew Moorer wasn't going to get up, but I guess it was a little too early." . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 After the postfight news conference, Foreman relaxed for about 45 minutes in 
his hotel suite with his wife, Joan, and his all-time favorite athlete, Magic 
Johnson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 At 10 p.m., Foreman marched victoriously through the casino. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He was headed to the buffet. The previous few days, Gorge-ous George had 
picked at his food. Not this time. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Call him anything but superstitious. He not only wore the same trunks that he 
did the night Ali knocked him out, he stayed on the 13th floor of the hotel. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 A referee is doing a good job when you don't notice him in the ring. That 
could be said for Joe Cortez. Of course, the fighters made it easy for him. 
They had to be broken out of clinches only a couple of times all night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman's comeback began March 9, 1987, when he stopped Steve Zouski in the 
fourth round in Sacramento, eight days short of 10 years after he lost a 
12-round decision to Jimmy Young in San Juan, Puerto Rico. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This was Foreman's 28th victory in 30 fights during the revival. His career 
record is 73-4 with 68 knockouts. His KO percentage is the highest of any 
heavyweight champion. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If the World Boxing Assn. had gotten its way and blocked the fight because 
Foreman wasn't considered a suitable opponent, Moorer would have fought Joe 
Hipp. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday in Las Vegas, Hipp was hard-pressed to win a 10-round decision over 
someone named Rodolfo Marin. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether you're 45 or 55, that doesn't mean you're dead," Foreman said. "You 
can still have your dream, and sometimes dreams come true."

BILLS NEARLY OUT OF SUPER BOWL RACE; AFC: HOPES OF RETURNING A FIFTH TIME ARE 
DIM AFTER 22-17 LOSS TO JETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the past, Thurman Thomas did not allow the ball to be knocked loose. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Beebe did not get knocked cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Kelly did not knock on his helmet and scream into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, when the Buffalo Bills needed a last-second touchdown against a 
weakling team like the New York Jets, they simply rummaged through pockets 
bulging with experience and strength. 
</P>
<P>
 And somehow, they found it. They always found it. 
</P>
<P>
 But not Sunday. Maybe not this season. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game that looked and sounded like a concession speech, the four-time 
defending AFC champion Bills blew an 11-point lead and botched a last-minute 
drive Sunday in a 22-17 loss to the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
 Dropping to 5-4, facing five playoff contenders in their last seven games, the 
Bills have sent a message to those worried sick about another Bills-infested 
Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, you see everybody in this country starting to smile," said 
linebacker Darryl Talley. "Everybody is happy because the Bills are out. The 
Bills are down." 
</P>
<P>
 His words were echoed by others offering sad summaries of a season that is 
still seven weeks from completion. 
</P>
<P>
 In a locker room filled with yells and helmet slams, the only thing in shorter 
supply than inspiration was hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our backs aren't against the wall," Bills running back Thurman Thomas said. 
"Our backs are behind it." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Bills looked for that winning touchdown this time, all they found was 
a handful of memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning their final drive on the Jet 44-yard line with 3:12 remaining, the 
Bills slipped into the no-huddle offense that they had abandoned earlier. For 
an instant, it was the good old days. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly avoided a sack and hit Thomas on an eight-yard pass. Thomas cut inside 
on two runs for a first down. 
</P>
<P>
 After another pass and a Jet penalty, the Bills had the ball on the Jet 30 
with a minute left. 
</P>
<P>
 Next came three plays that have defined a season. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas momentarily caught a pass for 15 yards over the middle, but dropped it 
when he was smacked by James Hasty. 
</P>
<P>
 One short run later, Beebe caught another pass over the middle but dropped it 
when he was whacked by Bobby Houston. Beebe was knocked unconscious for a few 
seconds before hobbling off the field with a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Then on fourth down from the 27, Kelly was chased by Jeff Lageman and rushed a 
pass, bouncing it behind Thomas to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 And with it, the Bills' incredible championship streak? 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, we would have won that game," said Bill center Kent Hull. "You 
are seeing the Buffalo Bills fall down a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 A little bit? They have already lost more games than they lost in two of their 
previous four Super Bowl seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Falling into a second-place tie in the AFC East with the Jets, who swept their 
season series for the first time in eight years, the Bills have almost no 
chance of regaining the home-field advantage that helped them in previous 
postseasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure a lot of people are going to count us out now," Bill Coach Marv Levy 
acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? The Bills say it was inevitable, that while other teams have 
gotten younger and stronger through free agency, they have gotten older and 
thinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has been spending three years trying to find ways to stop us," Hull 
said. "Couple that with the fact that they have been picking people off our 
roster like Pro Bowl tackles and cornerbacks. . . . We can no longer just give 
a good effort and win." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Jets and first-year Coach Pete Carroll, Sunday represented their best 
effort of the season, particularly with at least half their starters playing 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a heroic effort," Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills were held to 95 yards in the second half, only 32 passing. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Bills were threatening to score at the end of the first half and 
regain an 11-point lead, linebacker Mo Lewis intercepted a pass from Kelly at 
the Jet 11. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Bills were threatening to take the lead in the middle of the fourth 
quarter, Donald Evans tipped a pass that forced them to settle for a field 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 That left the rest to Boomer Esiason, who threw for 170 yards despite 
suffering a sprained ankle, and Rob Moore, who caught 87 yards worth of passes 
and scored the eventual winning touchdown pass on a five-yard toss from Esiason 
late in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're like a fox, everybody always in the hunt for us," said Buffalo's Bruce 
Smith. "Bunch of dogs. Bunch of guys on horseback. Year after year after year." 
</P>
<P>
 Is this what it sounds like when the fox gets caught?

WALSH REMAINS THE PERFECT SOLUTION FOR BEARS, 20-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave Wannstedt didn't say it, but Steve Walsh's play did. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a safe bet that the sixth-year pro will be at quarterback for Chicago 
next week after improving to 4-0 as a starter with Sunday's 20-6 victory over 
Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh threw for two touchdowns and 205 yards, while rookie Raymont Harris 
paced a rushing attack that produced a season-high 178 yards and kept the 
Buccaneers (2-7) off balance all afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory stopped a two-game losing streak for Chicago (5-4), which had its 
second-best offensive day of the season (383 yards). The Bear defense, last in 
the NFL against the run, held the Bucs to 38 yards on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Steve played extremely well," said Wannstedt, who didn't officially 
name a starting quarterback for next week's game at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh, starting for the first time with a healthy Erik Kramer on the sideline, 
completed 19 of 32 passes and was intercepted once. Harris gained 79 yards on 
19 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Trent Dilfer made his second pro start for Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears sacked the first-round pick twice and forced him to hurry several 
throws during a 13-for-25 performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Dilfer finished with 159 yards passing and scrambled for 15 yards to set up 
one of Tampa Bay's two field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh threw second-half touchdown passes of one yard to Keith Jennings and 
four yards to Robert Green to break open a close game. Kevin Butler also kicked 
field goals of 18 and 37 yards for Chicago, which rebounded from last Monday 
night's 33-6 loss to Green Bay.

LIONS, BEHIND KRIEG, NEARLY PULL OFF COMEBACK; NFC: DOWN, 31-7, TO PACKERS AT 
HALFTIME AND WITHOUT MITCHELL, DETROIT RALLIES, BUT LOSES, 38-30. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Green Bay Packers' top-rated defense stuffed Barry Sanders and knocked out 
Scott Mitchell. That almost wasn't enough against the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers, behind Brett Favre's three second-quarter touchdown passes, built 
a 24-point lead in three quarters Sunday, yet won only 38-30 when Dave Krieg's 
fourth-down pass was broken up in the end zone with 42 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Krieg, taking over after Mitchell broke a bone in his right hand in the second 
quarter, led the Lions on late touchdown drives of 72 and 58 yards, both of 
them capped by two-point conversions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions said Mitchell would be out indefinitely. He finished five of 15 for 
63 yards with no touchdowns and two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Krieg drove the Lions to the Green Bay 15 with less than a minute left, but 
Sean Jones had a sack for a five-yard loss on third down. Krieg's desperation 
pass, intended for Aubrey Matthews, was knocked down by cornerback Doug Evans, 
who said: "It was just a great play by me." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Evans' teammates weren't quite so upbeat after allowing the Lions to 
make a game of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some sorry faces in there," Packer Coach Mike Holmgren said, "and 
I kind of got after them: 'We won the game! Smile! I want to see some happy 
faces.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Green Bay's Jones said Mitchell's injury was the worst thing that could have 
happened to the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
 The left-handed Mitchell, who signed a three-year, $11.1 million free-agent 
contract in the offseason, was hit hard by defensive end Reggie White midway 
through the second quarter and left the game after the next play, an 
incompletion in which he also was knocked to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Krieg, although fumbling away his first snap, completed 23 of 33 passes for 
275 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was very important how the team rallied around David," Detroit 
Coach Wayne Fontes said. "But we can't jump up and down because we made this 
great comeback. A loss is a loss." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders, who entered the game with 1,035 rushing yards -- more than 24 NFL 
teams -- was held to 47 yards in 15 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers (5-4) forced five turnovers, four of them in the first half. 
Robert Brooks caught his first two touchdown passes as Green Bay produced its 
most points since a 38-10 victory over Detroit on Dec. 6, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Green Bay scored its first 17 points off turnovers on its way to a seemingly 
safe, 31-7, halftime lead. Detroit's only first-half touchdown came on Mel 
Gray's 91-yard kickoff return. He had a 102-yarder against Chicago three weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions, who won the NFC Central last season, fell to 4-5.

VIKINGS WIN ON MOON'S PASS TO ISMAIL; NFC: KEY PLAY OF 21-20 VICTORY OVER 
SAINTS COMES WITH FIVE SECONDS LEFT, CAPS 84-YARD DRIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the huddle, there was only one voice, Warren Moon's, and 10 players who had 
no doubt he would save them again. And he did. 
</P>
<P>
 Moon led Minnesota on an 84-yard drive in the final 2:44 on Sunday, covering 
the final 11 yards on a pass to Qadry Ismail with five seconds remaining as the 
Vikings defeated New Orleans, 21-20. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you know you need it, Warren will come in and say, 'This is what we've 
got to do, everybody listen,' " receiver Jake Reed said. "And everybody 
listens." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings (7-2) needed Moon's leadership in the waning moments for the 
second game in a row at the Metrodome after the Saints (3-6) took a 20-14 lead 
on two field goals by Morten Andersen late in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 As he did against Green Bay on Oct. 20, Moon drove Minnesota to the points it 
needed when it needed them most. Against the Packers, Moon led the Vikings to 
Fuad Reveiz's tying field goal with 17 seconds left, and the winning kick on 
the first possession of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the Saints, Moon, who had his fifth career 400-yard game Sunday, never 
doubted the Vikings would find another way to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt we had a chance," he said, the wrist on his throwing hand 
wrapped in ice from an aggravated sprain. "It was just a matter of putting it 
all together, and we waited until the last minute to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Moon was eight of 12 for 86 yards on the winning drive, including a four-yard, 
fourth-down completion to Amp Lee at the New Orleans 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Four plays later, he completed a pass to Ismail in the left flat. Ismail 
dodged one defender and dove over another for the winning points, stunning the 
Saints, who badly needed a victory to save their playoff hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to describe how I feel after this one, or how our whole team 
feels," New Orleans Coach Jim Mora said. "It was a tough one. We had an 
opportunity to come up here and beat a good football team at their stadium, and 
we let it get away from us." 
</P>
<P>
 Moon stole it, actually. He finished 33 of 57 for 420 yards and two 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the most attempts of his career, surpassing the 56 passes he threw 
against Dallas on Nov. 10, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 His heroics this time kept Minnesota two games ahead of the Packers in the NFC 
Central after Green Bay defeated Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-6 start is the Saints' worst since 1985, and New Orleans is in danger of 
missing the playoffs for the second consecutive year, something the Saints 
haven't done since 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings, meanwhile, are off to their second 7-2 start in three years under 
Coach Dennis Green. 
</P>
<P>
 Cris Carter had 12 catches for 151 yards for Minnesota, and Reed had eight 
catches for 157, including a 59-yarder to set up the Vikings' first touchdown 
late in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 For New Orleans, Jim Everett was 24 of 36 for 256 yards and two touchdowns.

FUMBLE ALLOWS STEELERS TO WIN; AFC: BROWN'S MISCUE IN OVERTIME SETS UP 
ANDERSON'S FIELD GOAL FOR A 12-9 VICTORY OVER OILERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Running back Gary Brown's fumble gave Gary Anderson the one extra kick the 
Pittsburgh Steelers needed to defeat the Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game with no touchdowns, the only turnover Sunday set up Anderson's 
40-yard field goal with 3:36 to play in overtime, giving the Steelers a 12-9 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like playing golf," Anderson said. "If you take a good swing at the 
ball you're going to hit it well." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson also had field goals of 50, 39 and 37 yards. Al Del Greco kicked 
field goals of 32 and 49 yards before his 38-yarder with seven seconds to play 
in regulation tied the score at 9-9. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been through it so many times, that's what kicking is all about," 
Anderson said. "I'm just glad that we had one more kick than they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson got his chance to be the hero when Brown fumbled after an eight-yard 
gain to the Houston 22. After one rush by Bam Morris, Anderson kicked the 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each week, it gets more bizarre," Oiler Coach Jack Pardee said. "We thought 
the key to the game would be turnovers and it did come down to that, but it was 
just one." 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Neil O'Donnell pieced together a fourth-quarter drive that 
included a 33-yard pass to Yancy Thigpen and led to Anderson's 37-yard field 
goal for a 9-6 lead with 3:57 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were two great defenses going at it," O'Donnell said. "We knew coming 
into this game there were no great weaknesses in their defense. We killed 
ourselves a couple of times in the red zone." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers (1-8) responded in the closing minutes behind Cody Carlson, booed 
earlier in the game for his poor play. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson completed a 26-yard pass to Ernest Givins on fourth and 23 at the 
Houston six and followed with a 25-yard completion to Gary Wellman that got the 
Oilers in position for Del Greco's tying 38-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell suffered a leg injury when he was sacked by linebacker Al Smith with 
12:09 left in overtime and was replaced by Mike Tomczak, who couldn't produce a 
touchdown, either. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Steelers (6-3) didn't need one after Brown's fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to make a play and I got stripped," Brown said. "It seems like 
every time I try to give a little extra effort, something bad happens. I feel 
so bad because I let my teammates down."

HOARD LEADS BROWNS OVER PATRIOTS; AFC: ON WINDY DAY IN CLEVELAND, RUNNING BACK 
HAS 123 RUSHING YARDS AND SCORES ON A PASS PLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leroy Hoard isn't merely a running back. He's an adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I make everybody nervous," Hoard said with a grin Sunday after he ran for 123 
yards, scored the only touchdown and kept the opposition -- and even his 
teammates -- off balance in the Cleveland Browns' 13-6 victory over the New 
England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns (7-2), off to their best start since 1965, matched their victory 
total for all of last season. New England (3-6) lost its fourth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoard had the most productive rushing day of his five-year career, both in 
carries (21) and yardage gained. He is the first Cleveland back to gain 100 
yards since Tommy Vardell did it in September of last year, and his 123 yards 
were the most by a Brown back since Kevin Mack ran for 133 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns generally don't give Hoard that many chances because he has a 
tendency to try too hard -- and fumble in the process. But when he holds onto 
the ball, Hoard can be magnificent. 
</P>
<P>
 He broke loose for a 39-yard run -- Cleveland's longest of the year -- on the 
second play of the game, and picked up most of the rest of his yardage in 
short, slashing bursts. 
</P>
<P>
 The running game was critical to both teams because winds gusting to 40 m.p.h. 
and intermittent rains made passing difficult. Even New England, which because 
of Drew Bledsoe's arm is as one-dimensional a team as there is in the NFL, let 
Marion Butts run 25 times for 86 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to be a rocket scientist to know you're not going to be able 
to throw in that wind," Hoard said. "We have one of the best punt returners in 
the league (Eric Metcalf), and he couldn't even catch the ball out there 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoard put the Browns ahead to stay at 10-3 with an over-the-shoulder grab of 
Mark Rypien's one-yard pass on third down early in the fourth quarter. Hoard 
made it look harder than it should have been, juggling the ball before pulling 
it in as he fell to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wind blew the ball. It kind of floated," Hoard said. "I kind of jumped 
for it and I jumped too early. But I tipped it and caught it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns withstood two New England threats at the end. Stevon Moore gathered 
in an onside kick with 2:10 to play, and Mike Caldwell intercepted Bledsoe's 
Hail Mary pass as time expired.

CUNNINGHAM DOWNPLAYS PAYBACK FACTOR; NFC: HE SAYS HE RESPECTS RYAN'S DEFENSE 
AFTER LEADING THE EAGLES TO A 17-7 VICTORY OVER CARDINALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Randall Cunningham was embarrassed after Buddy Ryan lifted him from a playoff 
game five years ago in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, it was payback time for Cunningham, who threw two touchdown passes 
to Fred Barnett in the third quarter as the Philadelphia Eagles defeated Ryan's 
Arizona Cardinals, 17-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham, who will face the Cardinals again in two weeks, insisted he got no 
special kick out of beating Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I respect Buddy's defense," he said. "It's a challenge for a quarterback to 
be over 50% passing against it." 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge was met by Cunningham, who completed 15 of 24 passes for 201 
yards. He also ran eight times for 63 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Eagle Andre Waters, now the strong safety for the Cardinals, said 
Cunningham was the difference in the game and the difference between 
Philadelphia last year, when the Eagles were 8-8, and this season, when they're 
7-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "He comes out to the park and makes plays," Waters said. "I was a little 
surprised he ran the ball as much as he did. It kills a defense. When you stop 
them for two downs and he makes a big play, it's really a defensive back's 
nightmare. It's a defense's nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagle defense produced two turnovers and five sacks to spoil Ryan's return 
to Philadelphia, where he was fired after lifting Cunningham for a series in 
the Eagles' 20-6 loss to the Washington Redskins on Jan. 5, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, Ryan had only good things to say about Cunningham. "Randall 
made the plays he had to make to beat us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnett, whose touchdown catches covered 47 and 50 yards, caught a career-high 
11 passes for 173 yards. Like Cunningham, he, too, was lost for the year in the 
fourth game last season. Cunningham suffered a broken leg, Barnett a knee 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia almost recorded its first shutout in two years, but Arizona (3-6) 
scored on a five-yard touchdown pass from Steve Beuerlein to Ricky Proehl with 
1:51 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The game turned in the third quarter after a 36-yard field goal by Eddie 
Murray with five seconds left in the first half put the Eagles on top, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt Grossman sacked Beuerlein at midfield, forcing a fumble that Mark 
McMillian recovered at the Arizona 47. On the next play, Cunningham threw a 
perfect pass down the left sideline to Barnett, who caught the ball in stride 
at the eight and breezed into the end zone to put Philadelphia up, 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Eagles' next series, Cunningham threw a Hail Mary-type pass into triple 
coverage. The ball glanced off defender Terry Hoage's hands to Barnett, who ran 
the final 14 yards to complete the 50-yard scoring pass play.

49ERS USE LONG-DISTANCE PLAYS TO BEAT REDSKINS; NFC: MCDONALD'S 73-YARD 
INTERCEPTION RETURN FOR A TOUCHDOWN PERHAPS THE BIGGEST IN 37-22 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a game filled with big plays from San Francisco's offense, defense and 
special teams, perhaps none was bigger than Tim McDonald's 73-yard interception 
return for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald was one of four 49ers with plays of 50 yards or more -- three for 
scores -- in a 37-22 victory Sunday over the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 Dexter Carter returned a kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown and Steve Young 
teamed with Brent Jones on a 69-yard touchdown pass play. Jerry Rice scored on 
a 28-yard reverse and also had a 55-yard catch that set up a short touchdown 
run by Young. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt that the reason we were able to win the ballgame was the key big 
plays," 49er Coach George Seifert said. "There were a couple of big pass plays 
. . . a return and an interception. That allowed us to be in the position that 
we were." 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers (7-2) left the Redskins (2-8) winless in six games at RFK Stadium, 
their worst start at home since 1961 when they also began 0-6. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redskins had a chance to stay in the game, but McDonald stole Washington's 
last hope. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Redskins' first real drive, trailing, 17-3, quarterback Gus Frerotte 
reacted to a blitz on third and six at the 49er 22 by trying to dump the ball 
off to running back Ricky Ervins in the flat. 
</P>
<P>
 But McDonald was watching and waiting, aware that his team needed to stunt the 
momentum Washington was building. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald tipped the ball, reaching up to his left, then pulled it in and 
sprinted, untouched, 73 yards to the end zone for a 24-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just don't see the robber in that situation, and Tim McDonald made a 
great play," Frerotte said. "He's just roaming around, not covering anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Young showed what the NFL's top-rated passer can do against the league's 
26th-rated defense, picking apart the Redskins' secondary early in the game. He 
was so effective early he took the fourth quarter off, finishing 15 of 25 for 
291 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice was one of several offensive weapons the 49ers unleashed. 
</P>
<P>
 He caught three passes for 90 yards. Ricky Watters caught six passes for 66 
yards and Jones had the 69-yarder.

BENGALS GET THEIR FIRST VICTORY; AFC: BLAKE PASSES FOR 387 YARDS AND PELFREY'S 
KICK IN OVERTIME DEFEATS SEAHAWKS, 20-17. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 It might have taken September, October and part of November, but the 
Cincinnati Bengals finally won a game. 
</P>
<P>
 After eight consecutive losses and approaching last season's mark of futility, 
the Bengals defeated the Seattle Seahawks in overtime Sunday, 20-17. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Blake passed for 387 yards and Doug Pelfrey won the game with his sixth 
field goal, a 26-yarder with 6:46 to play in the extra period. 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the heady scent of victory that the Bengals began to think 
intoxicating thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows after you win one?" Pelfrey said. "We could end up with eight 
wins." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory broke a 15-game road losing streak for the Bengals and marked 
their second strong game. Last week they lost to the Dallas Cowboys, 23-20, in 
a game in which they led at halftime, 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Seattle, the Bengals (1-8) set up their winning field goal on a 
76-yard pass from Blake to Darnay Scott, a rookie from San Diego State. Pelfrey 
set a team record by also making kicks of 36, 44, 36, 47 and 28 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake got most of the credit for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sparked a wave of enthusiasm for us," Keith Rucker said. "He gave this 
team a different view of what's going to happen every Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bengals didn't win until their 11th game last season. They also had a 
safety in handing the Seahawks (3-6) their fifth loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of 46,630 saw the first NFL game of the season in the Kingdome, which 
was closed July 19 after ceiling tiles fell before a baseball game between the 
Mariners and Baltimore. The Kingdome underwent $32.5 million in roof and 
ceiling repairs, a job that might run $9 million over the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks played their first three home regular-season games and two home 
exhibition games at the University of Washington's Husky Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake, who made his first NFL start last week and passed for 243 yards against 
the Cowboys, completed 31 of 43 passes, with one interception. A third-year pro 
from East Carolina, Blake is filling in for the injured David Klingler. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Seahawks, Rick Mirer completed 13 of 32 passes for 181 yards, with no 
interceptions.

CHARGERS HAVE MEANS, NOT WAYS; INTERCONFERENCE: RUNNING BACK'S FIFTH 
CONSECUTIVE 100-YARD GAME DOESN'T OFFSET LACK OF TOUCHDOWNS IN 10-9 LOSS TO THE 
FALCONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Not even Natrone Means' fifth consecutive 100-yard game was enough to save the 
San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers failed to score a touchdown for the second time in three weeks, 
settling for three John Carney field goals in a 10-9 loss to the Atlanta 
Falcons on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a ton of mistakes," said Charger Coach Bobby Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the winning coach was unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm embarrassed about how we played offensively, but at least we won," said 
Falcon Coach June Jones, who watched his offense sputter after a 91-yard 
touchdown drive on the opening possession. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers (7-2), with Gale Gilbert starting for the injured Stan Humphries, 
thought they had a touchdown in the third quarter with the score 7-3, but 
Gilbert's short completion into the end zone was nullified by an offensive 
interference penalty on Duane Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Means finished with 102 yards in 25 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, San Diego dropped a 20-15 decision to the Denver Broncos, 
with Carney accounting for all the Chargers' points. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Carney extended his field-goal streak to 21, but missed a 47-yard 
attempt that sailed wide right with 8:01 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thought I had is that I wish I had it back," Carney said of his 
miss. "That's it. No distractions. No excuses. Just pushed it. That's all." 
</P>
<P>
 After Carney's second field goal cut the lead to 7-6, Norm Johnson kicked a 
23-yard field goal that put the Falcons ahead after three quarters, 10-6.

 The Chargers had driven from the 22 to the Atlanta two with the second-half 
kickoff, only to see Means dropped for a three-yard loss by Moe Gardner and 
Jessie Tuggle one play before Gilbert hit Alfred Pupunu for an apparent 
five-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 When the play was nullified by Young's penalty, Gilbert threw incomplete on 
third down and had to settle for Carney's second field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons (5-4) were sharp on only their opening series. 
</P>
<P>
 After being set back by a holding penalty on Darryl Ford on the opening 
kickoff, George led a 13-play, 91-yard touchdown drive in which he completed 
seven of nine passes for 71 yards, including a nine-yard touchdown pass to 
Terance Mathis 7:15 into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironhead Heyward also contributed to the drive with runs of one, eight and 12 
yards and had another 12 on a shovel pass from George. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathis caught George's pass, broke a tackle at the five and rammed through two 
defenders before falling in for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert, in his first NFL start since 1986, completed 22 of 38 passes for 207 
yards.

BRONCOS CAN'T TURN CORNER; RAMS: HENDERSON MAKES BIG PLAYS TO THWART ELWAY IN 
FINAL MINUTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ram cornerback Wymon Henderson didn't think his former teammate Denver 
quarterback John Elway was picking on him in the final minutes Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 But it sure looked that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Who could blame Elway for going right at Henderson on third- and fourth-down 
plays in the final two minutes of the Rams' 27-21 victory Sunday at Anaheim 
Stadium? Just look at what they brought to the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway, the comeback quarterback, the orchestrator of The Drive against 
Cleveland in the 1988 playoffs and 25 other game-winning, fourth-quarter 
drives. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson, cut by the Broncos last year, had the task of covering Pro Bowl 
tight end Shannon Sharpe. So was Wymon asking himself: Why me? 
</P>
<P>
 "Sharpe is a go-to guy all year for them, and they didn't do anything any 
different," Henderson said. "I don't think they were trying to pick on me like 
that in any way." 
</P>
<P>
 They were, but it didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson stopped Sharpe for only a two-yard gain on third and eight at the 
Rams' 48-yard line, and was in on the fourth-down throw that Sharpe thought he 
caught, but the officials ruled a drop and trapped ball. A catch would have 
given the Broncos a first down at the Ram 37. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Lord just willed it that it was an incomplete pass," Henderson said. 
"That's just the way it went. I just thank God it was incomplete." 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson sought divine intervention, but Sharpe thought he had a catch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was good," Sharpe said. "The official was on top of the play, so 
he had the position to make a good call. He probably did, but I didn't feel the 
ball hit the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Ram free safety Anthony Newman said Henderson made a "great play" on Sharpe's 
third-down catch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sweating bullets, but I knew we would come through," Newman said. "They 
had scored twice on us and we said, 'Enough is enough. We're putting a stop to 
it.' 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to be in that situation because we knew Elway was the best. If we 
can stop him, we can stop anybody. We did that, and we grew up a little today 
and we're winning the games we have to win. That's what I'm always talking 
about -- this team needs to grow up." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what he was thinking when he saw Elway trot on the field with a little 
more than two minutes left, Ram wide receiver Flipper Anderson smiled and said: 
"You're not going to do it today, Johnny. Not the way our defense was playing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams entered the fourth quarter with a 24-6 lead and nearly left with a 
loss. Elway began picking them apart on 82- and 80-yard drives. He found Glyn 
Milburn, who beat Henderson on the left side, for a 20-yard touchdown with 
13:56 left, and then drilled a 12-yard pass to Derek Russell between Newman and 
strong safety Marquez Pope for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were upset when they scored that second touchdown," Pope said. "But the 
veterans on the team were like, 'Look, we're still winning. We shouldn't be 
arguing or upset.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Elway completed 24 of 45 passes for 241 yards and two touchdowns, but the Rams 
held him to 40 yards passing in the first half as they built a 17-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-3 lead -- the same halftime advantage the Rams blew four weeks ago at 
Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "No visions of Green Bay today," cornerback Todd Lyght said. "I don't remember 
Green Bay or what they look like. We just want to win, and now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to do our thing and we'll win some ballgames in the second half. 
If the offense plays the rest of the season the way they played today, there's 
no telling, we might go 7-1." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the Rams have to settle for 4-5. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Newman points out, they are 2-0 against two of the best quarterbacks 
in the game -- Elway and Joe Montana. Six weeks ago, the defense shut out 
Kansas City's Montana for the first time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what our defense is all about," Newman said. "We like to be out there 
in the mix and take care of business."

OAK TREE AT SANTA ANITA; NO FLAWS FOR AUBE INDIENNE IN 'RIBBON RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Who needs Flawlessly? 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Charlie Whittingham didn't need the recently retired, two-time Eclipse 
Award winner as the nation's top grass mare to win his first Yellow Ribbon 
since 1985 Sunday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Aube Indienne proved her 8-1 upset in the Las Palmas Handicap three weeks 
earlier was no fluke with a half-length victory in the $400,000, Grade I turf 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Now perfect in two starts after moving to Whittingham's barn after being with 
Whittingham's former assistant, Rodney Rash, Aube Indienne wore down pacesetter 
Zoonaqua, then outfinished Fondly Remembered to win by a half-length in 2:02 
1/5 for the 1 1/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 A 15-1 outsider who had finished third in the Louis R. Rowan Handicap a week 
before, Fondly Remembered beat 5-1 shot Zoonaqua by a neck for the place. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Desormeaux, who rode Fondly Remembered in her last two races, was back on 
Aube Indienne on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "She ran well again, but today she got lucky," Desormeaux said of the winner. 
"I had nowhere to go at the half-mile pole. Chris Antley (Fondly Remembered's 
rider) and I were jockeying for position. I got to sneak through and I got 
about four or five lengths on him and then beat him a half-length. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, my filly was lucky today. I might have taken off the winner." 
</P>
<P>
 This was the fourth victory for Whittingham in the Yellow Ribbon, but his 
first since Estrapade strolled home nine years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "This takes some of the sting out of losing Flawlessly," said Whittingham, 81, 
who has picked up his stakes pace after going many months without an 
added-money victory. "It's great now that we've got one who looks like she's 
going to help us some. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's an honest filly and she had a good trip all the way. This race still 
has some special meaning for me. I've been there quite a few times and it's 
still a nice race to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Corrazona, the 5-2 second choice, turned in her third consecutive subpar 
performance. Beaten two lengths by Aube Indienne when fourth in the Las Palmas 
as the 7-10 choice, she finished seventh of 11 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "She made a nice mid-rally around the turn like I was going to be in the thick 
of things," Gary Stevens said of Corrazona. "I was on the outside moving with 
(Desormeaux). She moved for about a sixteenth of a mile, then just quit running 
on me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what was going on with her. She feels good underneath me. She 
was making a little bit of a whistling noise pulling up. Maybe she's got some 
kind of infection going on. She's too nice of a filly to run like she did 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 Yenda, who was the 2-1 favorite while coupled with Wandesta, finished fourth, 
a length behind Zoonaqua, then it was 10 more to La Frontera, Chesa Plana, 
Corrazona, Freckling Shadows, Wandesta, Wende and Magical Maiden. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beaten as the 2-1 favorite by Lindon Lime in the Sam Houston Handicap at the 
Dueling Grounds, Sir Mark Sykes is the lukewarm 7-2 choice to make amends in 
the $150,000 Carleton F. Burke Handicap today at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 The closing-day feature has attracted eight other entrants and will be run at 
1 1/4 miles on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Before going to Dueling Grounds, Sir Mark Sykes was third behind Navarone and 
Approach The Bench in the Del Mar Invitational Handicap and he won the 
Escondido at Del Mar. Corey Black will again ride for trainer Jenine Sahadi. 
</P>
<P>
 Stark South, second at 17-1 in the recent Henry P. Russell Handicap, is the 
7-2 second choice. The 6-year-old is winless in eight starts this year and will 
be ridden by Laffit Pincay. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the field are Frenesi, Regency, Newton's Law, a two-time winner 
at the meeting, Square Cut, Savinio, Sneakin Jake and Frenchpar, a 4-year-old 
colt making his first American start after winning two of 11 in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race before the Burke, Desert Stormer is the 2-1 favorite against eight 
fillies and mares in the six-furlong Bara Lass, a $60,000 overnight stakes. 
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The victory in the Yellow Ribbon was the third in the last four years for 
Desormeaux. He won with Kostroma in 1991 and Super Staff in 1992. . . . Besides 
Estrapade, Whittingham's other Yellow Ribbon victories came with Queen To 
Conquer in 1981 and Castilla in 1982. . . . Stalcreek, who upset Hollywood 
Wildcat in the La Canada Stakes earlier this year, has been retired and will be 
bred to Storm Bird. . . . Desormeaux won three times Sunday.

ITO WEIGHS POSSIBLE TV CAMERA BAN TODAY; SIMPSON CASE: FEW JOURNALISTS THINK 
JUDGE WILL FOLLOW THROUGH ON THREAT TO OUST COVERAGE FROM HIS COURT. BUT MEDIA 
LAWYERS WILL BE OUT IN FORCE TO ARGUE THEIR CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito opens scheduled hearings this morning 
in the O.J. Simpson double murder case, he will take up an issue that has been 
on the back burner for weeks: whether he should end courtroom television 
coverage of the most publicized criminal case in recent American jurisprudence. 
</P>
<P>
 While few journalists think the judge will follow through with his threat to 
ban the single television camera that provides live images from the Simpson 
case to scores of broadcast outlets, no one is taking a chance; news media and 
civil liberties lawyers will be out in force today to argue against the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a dozen news organizations, including The Times, have filed joint or 
separate written arguments against what they view as an unfair, misdirected 
attempt by Ito to deal with his frustrations over inaccurate or improper 
reporting by some television stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining with them are legal scholars, journalism associations, broadcast and 
print trade groups and an Arizona-based coalition that fights to protect 
constitutional freedoms of speech and the press. 
</P>
<P>
 And the American Civil Liberties Union has filed a so-called "friend of the 
court" brief in hopes of dissuading Ito from banning the camera, which is 
operated by Court TV. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-court cable network has provided its viewers -- and viewers of other 
TV outlets -- with live, gavel-to-gavel coverage of almost all the Simpson 
proceedings except jury selection, which by court rules cannot be broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever problems have arisen regarding certain media reports in the case do 
not relate to the issues of televising the actual courtroom proceedings," the 
ACLU wrote in its brief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Indeed the surest antidote to misinformation about this case is courtroom 
audio and video that allows the public to hear and see what is happening as it 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Arenella, a UCLA law professor who joined the ACLU's brief, argues that 
the broadcast blackout would fail to lessen the "intense media glare" 
surrounding the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, he said, it would only increase the chances of inaccurate or 
irresponsible stories by reporters desperate for a competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, in a television interview taped Sunday after a campaign 
appearance in Seattle, said he was "troubled" by the amount of pretrial 
publicity and, in particular, by the televising of the pretrial proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been better if they (pretrial hearings) hadn't" been televised, 
Clinton said in an interview with CNN's Larry King, who had asked the President 
if he thought Simpson could receive a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Televising the trial itself would pose less of a problem because the jury has 
already been chosen, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there can be a fair trial, but it's much more difficult to impanel a 
jury" because of the publicity, said Clinton, who once served as Arkansas' 
attorney general. "There's never been anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although jurors have been questioned about putting aside what they already 
know about the case, "we can't help being affected by the things we know," 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's remarks on the case were unusual. Presidents generally do not 
comment on pending trials to avoid the possibility of inadvertently influencing 
jurors. President Nixon drew headlines when he declared Charles Manson guilty 
during that trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also praised both the defense attorneys and prosecutors, as well as 
the judge, saying he thinks Ito has been "firm and fair." 
</P>
<P>
 "He has an enormously difficult task," Clinton added. "It's a very sad case. 
It's the sort of thing that brings great pain to the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito first made his threat to exclude the camera in late September, three days 
before jury selection began. The threat came after local television station 
KNBC Channel 4 reported and then stood by its story that a pair of socks 
retrieved from Simpson's bedroom had been subjected to DNA tests at a Maryland 
laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 The KNBC report asserted that test results pointed to Simpson's ex-wife Nicole 
Brown Simpson as the source of blood found on the socks, a clear -- and 
unproven -- implication that Simpson had been at the murder scene outside his 
ex-wife's condominium in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The station later acknowledged that at least some information provided by its 
sources had been inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito felt the KNBC report had the potential of prejudicing a jury against the 
former football great, who has pleaded not guilty in the June 12 deaths of his 
ex-wife and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito was joined in that conclusion by both the defense and the prosecution, 
which contended that its credibility was being eroded. 
</P>
<P>
 But the matter seemed to have been forgotten until Oct. 3, when Ito learned 
that local television stations had, against court rules, aired footage from 
inside the courthouse that showed the faces of jurors sitting on cases other 
than Simpson's. 
</P>
<P>
 And a few days earlier, the judge had been rankled to read in the Daily News, 
a San Fernando Valley-based newspaper, the contents of juror questionnaires 
before he had officially made those documents public. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court proposes to terminate film and electronic coverage" of the trial, 
Ito wrote in a tersely worded order distributed to Steven Brill, president of 
Court TV, and other news organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also abruptly ordered out of the courthouse the same cameras he had 
allowed in the hallway outside his courtroom, where some footage of the 
non-Simpson jurors had been shot. 
</P>
<P>
 He then scheduled the hearing that is set for today. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, judges are allowed to bar cameras from their courtrooms if they 
decide their presence threatens the dignity or orderly performance of the 
proceedings, or a defendant's right to a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But pulling the plug on the courtroom camera in the Simpson case would destroy 
elaborate arrangements by broadcast news organizations to cover a trial for 
which they seem to have an insatiable appetite. 
</P>
<P>
 If Ito follows through, "I don't know how the trial would be covered," Carolyn 
Fox told The Times last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox is executive director of the Radio and Television News Assn., the Southern 
California group coordinating broadcast coverage of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Others have noted the lengths to which broadcast news organizations have 
already gone in planning for the trial, spending at least $1 million to set up 
a virtual video village -- with elaborately equipped trailers and open-air 
studios -- across the street from the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Television outlets also paid up to $15,000 each for space in a courthouse 
pressroom, where they have constructed high-tech mini-studios.

OTHER MEDIA; A BLACK SERIES FADES; WHERE'S THE CLICKER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In our February issue we did a story on an up-and-coming TV series called 
"Mantis." We watched the pilot program as a family and we were all quite proud, 
in fact we were beaming. The pilot program showed black people in very positive 
roles of responsibility. A science-fiction series with blacks as the major 
players -- not sidekicks. The series is directed by Eric Laneuville, who is no 
stranger to special effects on the Hollywood scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The series premiered last month, and about five minutes into the show we 
realized something was wrong. Where were all the African co-stars? Where did 
all the white supporting characters come from? What happened to all the black 
pride? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, as usual, we have been had! There must have been some negative feedback 
from someone and Fox TV (must have) requested that Mr. Laneuville, a proud 
black man well respected by his black industry peers, compromise. There were 
many overt and subtle differences between the pilot and series. Some bear 
mentioning: In the pilot, Mantis was the creator of all the high-tech gizmos. 
His assistants were clearly proud Africans and his whole setup had an African 
mystique to it. In the series, his assistant is a white male and it seems that 
he knows more about how Mantis gets his super powers than the hero does. In the 
pilot the main bad guys rode bikes and were white. In the series a new 
assistant (white) good guy is on the scene and just happens to ride a bike. The 
star is the only black leading character in the whole program.  
</P>
<P>
 What started out to be a series that we could enjoy and be proud of has turned 
into a turn-the-channel type of deal.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TODAY'S TOPIC; 
PANHANDLING: HOW FAR CAN MERCHANTS GO IN STOPPING IT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Few people would regard panhandling as an honorable way of making money, but 
begging is certainly an ancient profession. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of begging, according to Madeleine Stoner, an expert on 
homelessness and a professor of social work at USC, dates back to 17th-Century 
Elizabethan England. The feudal system was breaking up and, for the first time, 
people who previously lived on protected manors were without homes or work. 
"The nation was beset by transients -- in effect, homeless people," says 
Stoner. 
</P>
<P>
 The beggars and transients spread through Western Europe and, eventually to 
the United States. In times of large waves of immigration, such as the turn of 
the 20th Century, or in times of economic depression, the numbers of beggars 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
 While no one has even estimated how many people make their living, or part of 
it, by panhandling, there is an impression that the numbers of people who beg 
for money are growing and that they are becoming more aggressive in their 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, some communities are instituting programs to encourage residents 
to donate money to local charities that help the homeless rather than to the 
panhandlers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Platform, activists in Hollywood -- where panhandling on Hollywood 
Boulevard has been a particular problem -- debate one such effort to get 
panhandlers off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood's merchants might examine a similar program in Torrance, where last 
summer the Police Department and downtown business community teamed to produce 
a sign displayed by local merchants that asked customers to donate their money 
to charity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It must have been successful," Torrance Police Officer Don Sherwood says. 
"The panhandlers have disappeared and we're not receiving complaints like we 
used to from ladies who felt they were threatened or scared or intimidated." 
</P>
<P>
 Aggressiveness, however, is not a legal reason to outlaw panhandlers, 
according to Carol Sobel, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone goes beyond the limits, the general rules (of law) protect 
people," says Sobel. "But it doesn't matter if the person is asking for a 
charitable contribution for the Girl Scouts, for themselves, or to sign a 
petition. You are allowed to approach someone in a public place and you can't 
have special rules to punish poor people asking for help." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, not all panhandlers are aggressive or, for that matter, are drug 
and alcohol abusers. "There are some very needy people out there due to factors 
beyond their control," says Ron Fagan, a sociology professor at Pepperdine. 
"But even the advocates are acknowledging that there are panhandlers out there 
scamming people." 
</P>
<P>
 And since people walking down the street can hardly make that distinction for 
themselves, says Fagan, programs to help the homeless in other ways are 
positive, not punitive.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: THE SUBJECT IS 
FREEDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to Kevin Ross' piece on Proposition 187 ("Is Black-Latino Friction 
a Voting-Booth Issue,?" Oct. 24), I would like him to consider the following 
proposal: 
</P>
<P>
 "The People of California find and declare as follows:  
</P>
<P>
 That they have suffered and are suffering economic hardship caused by the 
presence of black people in this state.  
</P>
<P>
 That they have suffered and are suffering personal injury and damage caused by 
the criminal conduct of blacks in this state.  
</P>
<P>
 That they have a right to protection of their government from any person or 
persons that are black.  
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, the People declare their intention to provide cooperation between 
their agencies of state and local government with the federal government, and 
to establish a system of required notification by and between such agencies to 
prevent black people in the United States from receiving benefits or public 
services in the State of California."  
</P>
<P>
 That is how Proposition 187 would read if black people were substituted for 
illegal aliens.  
</P>
<P>
 Can Ross really be telling us that it's OK to do this as long as it's aimed at 
Latinos? 
</P>
<P>
 As a 12th grader at Birmingham High School and the son of an Asian father and 
Latina mother, I think it is sad that an African American who knows the 
struggle his race has gone through to be free is willing to stop another race 
because of "a strained relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross seems to think that he is safe from the effects of Proposition 187 
because he is not an illegal immigrant. Doesn't he realize that any type of 
discrimination makes us all a little less free? Grow up, dude!

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: COMMUNITY ESSAY; WHY 
DO MOTHERS KILL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEANNE TILTON DURFEE, In the last few weeks, several mothers have drawn 
national attention for allegedly killing their children: Dora Buenrostro in San 
Jacinto, Calif., Susan Smith in Union, S. C. and Pauline Zile in West Palm 
Beach, Fla. Deanne Tilton Durfee, executive director of the Los Angeles County 
Interagency Council on Child Abuse and Neglect, told freelance writer CATHERINE 
GEWERTZ about parents who kill. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We are not certain of the true extent of the problem in this country. But 
statistics show that three to five children are killed by parents or caretakers 
each day in the United States. Of those, one child per week comes from Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Most are very young. Two-thirds are under age 2 and 40% to 50% are under age 
one. The triggers tend to be chronic crying and toilet training, stresses that 
arise in caring for a child that age. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the common factors is a parent who is unprepared for the demands of 
caring for a very young child. Often in a moment of exasperation or in some 
cases substance abuse, they may take inappropriate action to stop a child from 
crying or to discipline a child because they don't understand why, for 
instance, a child might cry all night. 
</P>
<P>
 Isolation and poverty are strong factors. Very often the parent doesn't have 
good support from extended family, friends or neighbors, so they feel trapped. 
When you lack resources, you can't get a break from your kids. You can't afford 
babysitters or vacations. These crimes are more likely in urban areas or 
sparsely populated areas because of the stress or the isolation. Often parents 
who kill were abused themselves. There's an almost reflex action to respond in 
the way your parents responded to you. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common single category of caretaker who kills a child is the mother 
because mothers are most commonly the caretakers for young children. But they 
are still a minority of the cases. Nationally, 70& to 80% of caretakers who 
kill children are men: fathers, stepfathers, male companions and so on. In L.A. 
County that figure is 60%. We don't yet have anything solid on why (there's a 
difference). 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, parents say they didn't mean to kill the child, but rage or 
frustration got out of control. Deliberate plans to kill children are 
relatively rare. In those cases usually we see brain dysfunction or mental 
disorders. A parent may believe a child is purposely crying to make them angry, 
or that the devil has possessed the child. Domestic violence puts a child at 
very high risk. When there's a general atmosphere of violence in a home, when 
you have rage pointed in any direction, you increase the chance that that rage 
will be manifested in violence against the most susceptible victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Government can help. We have the first child death review team in the country. 
It brings many agencies together to review all cases of children who die under 
suspicious circumstances. It examines what happened and also gets the family 
the help it obviously needs. It lets us learn how these things happen so we can 
get better at preventing them. 
</P>
<P>
 We are starting a computerized index in Los Angeles in January. A network like 
that can alert one social service agency that another agency, or school, or 
police officer, or hospital emergency room, has had contact with the family and 
that there seems to be trouble, so preventive services can be offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Better prenatal care reduces the chances of a difficult, high-risk baby. 
Better parenting preparation is crucial. We need to fund family support 
services and must also have swifter severance of parental rights when it is 
clear they cannot provide appropriate parenting.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: GIVING BACK; 'IF 
COMMUNITIES BREAK DOWN, OUR INVESTMENT IS AT RISK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIA CLEVERDON is chief executive of Business in the Community, a 
London-based organization of which Prince Charles is president. The 
organization aids and encourages the involvement of British businesses in job 
and education programs. She talked with JAMES BLAIR during the prince's visit 
to Southern California last week about what Britons were learning from U.S. 
businesses' involvement in inner cities. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Business in the Community is the leading authority in Britain on how companies 
can get involved in their communities. It started in 1982 in the wake of the 
Toxteth and Brixton riots (inner-city riots with racial and economic overtones) 
when business woke up and said, this can't be the sort of society we need to 
build if Britain is going to be prosperous. So a small group of business 
leaders had a conference with American business leaders who came over to share 
their experience of the role of business in society. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Prince of Wales's visit to Boston in 1986, he found the Boston 
Compact (a program in which businesses offered guaranteed jobs to students who 
stayed in high school and did well) and was very impressed by its potential for 
helping to raise the achievement in inner-city schools. 
</P>
<P>
 He persuaded four or five top businessmen to look at it and see how it could 
be replicated in East London. After it had run two years the evidence was that 
it was really achieving results in raising attendance and getting young people 
motivated. At the same moment, the government set up a national program on 
getting compacts into every one of the main inner-city schools in Britain. 
Compacts are basically deals between young people, their parents, their school 
and local employers -- that if students achieve certain attendance, literacy 
and numeracy standards, then the community commits itself to those students. 
From 1988 to 1991, local employers were asked by the government to guarantee 
jobs for those who had achieved their goals. As the recession hit harder in 
Britain it became more difficult to guarantee jobs, but many companies still 
guarantee interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 I think there are some common experiences across the United Kingdom and the 
States about what makes a difference when you are trying to regenerate a 
community. I was very struck by the Food From the 'Hood example at Crenshaw 
High School. One of the student owners (quoted) to the prince, "It takes a 
village to raise a child." And one of the most important things that we're 
seeing both here and in the U.K. is the ways in which you can get the whole 
community involved in the achievement of young people (by increasing) the 
adult/student ratio -- not the teacher/pupil ratio -- by using mentors, 
volunteers, university students. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw IBM's marvelous program at Puente where they were supplying all the 
equipment for about 1,200 people going through training -- adult literacy and 
all the rest of it. Toyota's work I thought a very intelligent and impressive 
piece of community development, running something called the Toyota Automotive 
Training Center in cooperation with the Urban League. 
</P>
<P>
 It is becoming increasingly obvious that, in the U.K., if companies wish to be 
internationally competitive in a great global marketplace that can only be 
achieved if you have social cohesion. If communities are breaking down, skills 
are not there and long-term investment is at risk.  
</P>
<P>
 The disaster for company community involvement (is) if they go into it for 
short-term PR and don't see it as a long-term sustainable journey in 
partnership with the community. You can do untold damage just whizzing in and 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 (As) the Prince of Wales said during his visit, it's all about partnership.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: PUBLIC PLACES; 
HUMPHREY PARK: REVIVED WITH LOVE AND MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE SPILLER , For The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Youths growing up in North Pacoima in the 1960s and '70s played ball and swam 
in the pool at Hubert Humphrey Memorial Park, a 9.5-acre Los Angeles City park 
in a neighborhood of post-World War II housing tracts. But by the 1980's when 
Ramon Cerrillos, now 19, grew up here, budget cuts and a user fee system had 
left parks in low-income areas with little money for recreation programs. 
Without active use parks often become magnets for crime. Humphrey Park, which 
was taken over by a local gang and avoided by the community. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the Parks Department realized it needed outside help to mobilize the 
community to take the park back. Officials asked People for Parks, a nonprofit 
park support group serving L.A. County, to coordinate a series of meetings with 
community and business leaders, recreation administrators, the city council, 
neighbors and the police. New programs were developed and people in the 
neighborhood started coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, the turnaround is still in progress, but park usage has 
dramatically increased. Halloween night 350 kids came to a festival, the youth 
soccer program has 17 teams, and now the community comes out to play and watch 
sports and picnic. AL HENRIQUEZ 
</P>
<P>
 Recreation Director, Humphrey Park 
</P>
<P>
 When you get kids involved it makes the park a home for them and it deters 
gangs. Now we're also trying to get gang members involved. Gang members often 
get in trouble because they don't have any activities. We make contact through 
an ex-gang member. Friday nights we cook up hot dogs or carne asada to get them 
here and then we sign them up for the program. It's a coed program and the 
presence of girls seems to have a calming effect. Vandalizing the facility and 
graffiti never ceases as a problem but we're making a difference with some of 
these kids. RAMON CERILLOS 
</P>
<P>
 Recreation Assistant 
</P>
<P>
 We had no sports when I grew up here. Everybody was scared to come to Humphrey 
Park. I used to be a gang member, but I wanted to make a change, so I 
volunteered to help build the sports program. A lot of us have little brothers 
and sisters and you want to install some kind of pride in the kids. They can 
get pride that way instead of joining a gang. JACK FOLEY 
</P>
<P>
 Board member, People for Parks; Professor of Leisure Studies and Recreation, 
Cal State Northridge  
</P>
<P>
 People are afraid of crime so they build more prisons. We try to build life 
chances. We do it through recreation activities and giving children more 
involvement with adults. 
</P>
<P>
 We do things that are very cost effective. Sometimes a child being on a soccer 
team keeps that child out of jail.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: ANOTHER INMATE VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is in response to John Orr's article, "Inmate: Follow Through on '3 
Strikes," ' Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sitting in a county jail looking down both barrels of a three-strikes 
case.I could get 25 years to life for allegedly trying to pass a bad check, 
possession of stolen property and possession of about a tenth of a gram of 
methamphetamine. Personally, I don't feel that any of these crimes warrant a 
life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 My past is checkered, that's obvious. Yet I still agree that a three-strikes 
law, written correctly, would indeed benefit society. 
</P>
<P>
 Orr is correct when he says "The public should not have to tolerate violent, 
despicable behavior." I hope he's referring to himself. To me, a person who 
used his job as a Glendale fire chief to commit arson is much more diabolical 
than the average criminal. It is ironic that this guy who violated the trust of 
the public is now so adamant to protect same.

 It is fair to hold Rep. Michael Huffington responsible for his wife's beliefs. 
She states she is a member of the Greek Orthodox Church. Do you have any proof

WASHINGTON FLIRTING WITH FEDERAL INDUSTRIAL POLICY; THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION 
EMBARKS ON AN IMPORTANT EXPERIMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 None dare call it that, but the Clinton Administration is moving to establish 
an American industrial policy. Republicans have vowed to kill it if they gain 
control of Congress. So it is worth examining the Administration's efforts to 
redirect American technology in the post-Cold War era. 
</P>
<P>
 The instrument of this policy is a once-obscure agency that has suddenly 
become the fastest-growing agency in the federal government, the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Md. With hundreds 
of millions of dollars, it has the ambitious task of boosting American 
international competitiveness by making large grants to private companies 
exploring "high-risk, enabling" technologies and then actively promoting joint 
ventures and "alliances." 
</P>
<P>
 Some argue that the government has little expertise in such matters and that 
trying to pick winners and losers in the marketplace is not the responsibility 
of the taxpayer. But given competition from European and Japanese countries 
where governments have long subsidized technological companies, the new 
American approach is valid. Certain safeguards are needed, however, to protect 
the taxpayer and prevent the program from becoming one more piece of political 
pork.  
</P>

 NIST, formerly the dowdy National Bureau of Standards, is an arm of the 
Commerce Department. It has seen its budget skyrocket from $145 million in 1988 
to $855 million this year; it is proposed to grow to $1.4 billion by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 NIST's most potent tool is its advanced technology program. Since 1990 that 
program has awarded 130 grants to companies and consortiums totaling $407 
million. According to the NIST director, Arati Prabhakar, the money is meant 
not to support direct product development but to help companies overcome major 
technological hurdles that could open broad avenues of commercial 
possibilities. "This is technology policy, which is much narrower than 
industrial policy," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Each company must match the funds, but intellectual property rights belong to 
the company. Thus, for example, $2 million goes to GenPharm International Inc. 
of Mountain View, Calif., to help develop animal models with human gene 
segments for testing of treatments for Alzheimer's and other human diseases. 
Recipients also include such major companies as IBM, General Motors and Du 
Pont. 
</P>
<P>
 Why should the government do this at a time of fiscal strain? Cannot these 
companies support their own research and development? Why doesn't the 
government get royalties from any products? Those are questions being asked by 
several members of Congress, particularly Rep. Robert S. Walker of 
Pennsylvania, ranking Republican on the House Science, Space, and Technology 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon McQuitty, chief executive officer of GenPharm, which is only five years 
old and employs 90 people, says that the difficulty such young biotech 
companies have raising venture capital makes it too risky to do the kind of 
cutting-edge work supported by NIST. 
</P>
<P>
 It is naive to think the United States has never had an industrial policy. For 
half a century the Defense Department subsidized aerospace and military 
industries, fueling the Southern California boom. Does the government have a 
role now that the national mission is less focused? We think so, but the 
current program is too loosely drawn. The money is theoretically meant only for 
American companies, but that is very hard to define in this global economy. And 
we worry that Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown could use the program to 
reward political friends.  
</P>
<P>
 Most important, the taxpayers should recoup their investment and perhaps even 
get royalties should some company hit pay dirt with federal money. Legislation 
to do that has been passed in the House but so far thwarted by Ernest Hollings 
(D-S.C.) in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has embarked on an important experiment. It is too early to 
say if it has worked, but it is worth trying. Growing Budget: 
</P>
<P>
 Budget appropriations for National Institute of Standards and Technology 
</P>
<P>
 In millions of dollars 
</P>
<P>
 (proposed) '96: $1 billion 
</P>
<P>
 (proposed) '97: $1.4 billion

PROP. 187 STUDENT DEMONSTRATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nov. 2, as I stood at my third-floor window awaiting the arrival of witnesses 
so that we could proceed to a hearing, I was greeted by the sound of young 
voices and the sight of multicolored banners. There, on the City Hall steps, 
across from the Criminal Courts Building, hundreds of young people had gathered 
to petition their elected leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Spring Street from First to Temple had been effectively occupied by 10 to 15 
police vehicles and the more benign bicycle units. All were there in response 
to a citywide tactical alert, declared in anticipation of incipient "student 
unrest." Uniformed officers moved among those assembled while the neatly 
dressed and eminently orderly students sat or stood listening to speakers. Now 
and then they cheered in response to words that I could not hear. 
</P>
<P>
 As I watched and listened, in proud recollection I remembered other times and 
other causes of not long ago, times when their mothers and fathers may have 
been heard in similar protest on those very steps. And I recalled stories told 
by my mother and father who, at their advent onto the shores of this land, also 
encountered the anger and even the hate of those who had come before. 
</P>
<P>
 As I donned the black robe that signifies liberty and justice for all, I could 
hear the whispering voices of those others in fervent cadence declaring for all 
to hear, "We are . . . somebody, we are . . . somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, our children, you are. And last Wednesday you were the very best.

 Students staging walkouts and demonstrations for the right to stay in school! 
Incredible! Maybe one of the side benefits of Prop. 187 is an appreciation of 
the importance of school. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, maybe it is just another excuse to miss school and hang out 
with friends. Do these students have as much enthusiasm for their studies as 
they do for leaving campus to march down the street. I hope the former is the 
case.

 The anti-Prop. 187 comments in today's Times (editorials, Oct. 30), are, of 
course, hogwash. Since The Times is blatantly pro-illegal alien, it is 
understandable that Prop. 187 is anathema to your editors. Both Democrats and 
Republicans are responsible for the appalling illegal alien situation because 
for years Congress has deliberately underfunded the Border Patrol and the INS. 
</P>
<P>
 Prop. 187 shows unequivocally that the majority of the American people are 
utterly sick of our decadent political system and are attempting to accomplish 
what the government should have done years ago. The anti-Prop. 187 attitude of 
Clinton, Feinstein and their fellow parasites clearly show their special 
interest position. We need Prop. 187, Pete Wilson and a new U.S. senator.

 The illegal immigrants that are the target of Prop. 187 are here looking for a 
better life. They come from places that are economically depressed. They come 
from countries that are "democracies" in name only and that are happy to see 
these people emigrate, including Mexico. Most of these illegals, whether they 
cross our borders on land or from the seas, are good, hard-working people who 
deserve a better life. 
</P>
<P>
 It is often said that the United States is a nation of laws, not men. We 
punish our citizens for violating our laws. The opponents of 187 demand that we 
continue to reward those who violate our laws, as non-citizens, as if they are 
entitled to special dispensations because their home country is underdeveloped, 
oppressive or mismanaged.  
</P>
<P>
 For the first time I now have a means of saying "enough is enough" to Bill 
Clinton, Kathleen Brown, Mexico's foreign secretary and others. I will vote yes 
on 187.

 Backers of the controversial Prop. 187 have claimed all along that the measure 
is not racist. I am sure that the people who scream "Mexican lover!" and 
"Beaner!" at me when they see a "No on 187" bumper sticker on my car will also 
agree that the measure is not racist.

 The people in favor of 187 have argued throughout the last few months that 187 
does not violate any laws or deny California billions of federal money. The 
statement by the state counsel (Nov. 2) clearly disproves this. They found that 
187 is in clear violation of the state Constitution and of privacy laws. In 
many ways, this is a truly un-American proposition. Teachers and law officials 
prying into children's backgrounds and that of their parents violates the 
essential principles of this country. And 187 would cast us onto a dark and 
terrible road of suspicion and police mentality. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's deport 187 out of California and vote no on 187.

<P>
 Also, teachers are required by law to report to child abuse authorities, any 
"suspicious" injuries they observe on their students. 
</P>
<P>
 So, what's all this fuss about Prop. 187 forcing teachers to act like Big 
Brother and report illegal aliens to the proper authorities? Teachers are 
already acting as agents of the government in many capacities.

 I was outraged by Pat Buchanan's bald-faced attempt at scare-tactic journalism 
in his column, "What Will America Be in 2050?" (Commentary, Oct. 28). By 
tossing together such inflammatory images as a California secession and 
American apartheid districts, and mixing them in with a threatening nonwhite 
future and higher levels of racial tension, Buchanan has placed himself, in my 
opinion, on the cutting-edge of white supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
 His call for a stop to all immigration proves his own lack of belief in racial 
integration, despite his last-minute assurances that "the melting pot is in 
need of repair." His mention of the "redrawing of political lines to ensure 
proportional representation" is an out-and-out proof of his belief that 
discrimination in government based on race is not only a good, but necessary 
concept. 
</P>
<P>
 Would someone please tell Buchanan that it is not the influx of people from 
other nations that is causing racial tension, but rather people like him who 
are telling them to stay away, and hoping that those who have already arrived 
will go away? Perhaps in all fairness, he should return to the nation from 
which his great-great grandfather traveled. How many of our own ancestors 
arrived in America "legally"?

A FAIRER DEAL ON SCHOOL FUNDS; CALIFORNIA WILL BENEFIT FROM CHANGE IN FEDERAL 
DISTRIBUTION FORMULA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California is cheated nearly every time Washington doles out the federal Title 
I education funds, which are earmarked to help students doing poorly in school. 
Fortunately, that distribution formula will soon become more equitable. 
</P>
<P>
 The antiquated funding formula, which is based on the national census every 10 
years and average state spending per pupil, fails to keep pace with annual 
population surges fueled by high birthrates, immigration and migration in 
high-growth states such as California, Texas and Florida. The formula also 
fails to factor in the effect of the economic recession, which hit California 
hard, pushing more children and their parents into poverty and, often, 
negatively affecting their performance in school. The use of old data cost 
California heavily over the last decade and unfairly allowed states that lost 
population to hang on to more than their fair share. 
</P>
<P>
 The new formula, unanimously endorsed by the California congressional 
delegation, requires the U.S. Census Bureau, beginning in 1996, to update 
poverty figures every two years instead of every decade. The more frequent 
updates will record the regular increases of poor children who enroll in school 
in California, will allow a more frequent and equitable distribution of Title I 
funds.  
</P>
<P>
 Big money is at stake. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which the 
Senate finally managed to pass just prior to recessing last month -- despite a 
Republican filibuster over voluntary school prayer -- provides $12.7 billion to 
improve schools. Of that amount, $6.6 billion in Title I funds will go to help 
"educationally disadvantaged" children who do poorly in school. Though those 
children tend to be poor, many are not.  
</P>
<P>
 Poor children are the intended beneficiaries. Title I, after all, was created 
in 1965 as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's ambitious war on poverty. But 
in practice, congressional politics dictate that nearly every American school 
district share in the federal government's main form of aid to schools. The 
Clinton Administration wants the neediest students to get more of this federal 
aid, as Congress and President Johnson originally intended. 
</P>
<P>
 California counties already get a big chunk of the Title I money. These funds 
are often used to provide failing students with extra help in reading and math, 
to purchase computers and to hire extra teachers or aides. 
</P>
<P>
 The state can expect to receive $729.2 million for fiscal year 1995 and an 
even larger share after the new distribution formula takes effect in 1996. 
That's only fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor children who do poorly in school tend to do poorly in life. With the new 
funding formula it adopted, Congress has renewed its nearly 30-year-old 
commitment to stem the rising tide of failure. California schools will benefit 
from that commitment.

THE FLOCK THAT WOULDN'T STRAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a time when the all-too-publicized challenges of life here are prompting 
many to look to other pastures, it is a pleasure to report the decision of one 
pastor to keep his flock in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rt. Rev. Frederick H. Borsch, Episcopal bishop of Los Angeles, inherited a 
large question when he was appointed in 1988.Diocesan House, the Episcopal 
administrative center on West 4th Street near the Harbor Freeway, had been sold 
to a developer. A new home would have to be found. Where should it be? 
</P>
<P>
 Borsch's diocese includes not only Los Angeles County but Orange, Riverside, 
San Bernardino, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. St. Paul's, the Downtown 
cathedral, had stood severely damaged since the Sylmar earthquake of 1971; the 
cost of repair was prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, if ever, was the moment to retreat from Central Los Angeles to a cleaner 
and safer -- and inevitably wealthier -- neighborhood. Instead, Borsch opted to 
build a new cathedral on the site of the St. Athanasius and St. Paul Episcopal 
Church in Echo Park. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 22 the Cathedral Center -- complete with a credit union and a high 
school for 35 at-risk students -- was formally opened. Among its operations 
will be a neighborhood food program. 
</P>
<P>
 The spacious, graceful complex, overlooking Echo Park Lake across a broad 
sweep of lawn, is a reminder of the enormous potential that this section of Los 
Angeles, five minutes from City Hall and the skyscrapers of Downtown, retains. 
Borsch has given his far-flung diocese a new spiritual center and cast a bold 
vote of confidence in the future of the city.

CLINTON JUST TALKED THE TALK ON IDEALISM . . . ; PRESIDENCY: AMERICANS ARE 
DISPIRITED NOT BECAUSE HIS PROGRAMS STALLED, BUT BECAUSE HE FAILED TO FIGHT FOR 
A MORE CARING AND LESS CYNICAL NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LERNER, Michael Lerner, editor of Tikkun magazine, is author of 
Jewish Renewal: A Path to Healing and Transformation (G.P. Putnam's Sons, 
1994). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Democrats struggle to hold on to their control of Congress, they are 
astounded to find that the success of Bill Clinton's economic programs doesn't 
seem to impress the American people so much. The notion popular among pundits 
and political analysts that what people really care about is their narrow 
material self-interest is belied by the present widespread unease and 
unhappiness in America, despite a robust economy. The accepted wisdom that 
"it's the economy, stupid," has proved deeply misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony here is that Clinton himself seemed to understand that when he ran 
for the presidency in 1992. Over and over again he talked of the lack of vision 
and lack of moral compass for which the country hungered. While the media 
focused their attention on the economic aspects of his program, many Americans 
heard something very different: the sense that here was a man who might return 
us to the hopefulness, idealism and sense of common purpose that they deeply 
desire. 
</P>
<P>
 They heard these themes again when Hillary Rodham Clinton articulated her 
vision of a "politics of meaning." In her April, 1993, address in Austin, 
labeled the kickoff speech for her health-care campaign, she boldly told the 
country, "The market knows the price of everything but the value of nothing," 
and went on to insist that the country faced a spiritual and ethical crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 After 24 years in which narrow material self-interest was being proclaimed the 
"common sense" of American society, years in which Americans had made books 
like "Looking Out for No. 1" and "Winning Through Intimidation" into 
bestsellers as they struggled to find out how to survive in the ruthless 
competition of the marketplace, many people were hoping for a real change. They 
imagined that the Democrats, under the visionary leadership of the Clintons, 
would chart a new path. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy for a politics of meaning was simple and straightforward: It 
challenged America to switch the dominant discourse from an ethos of 
selfishness and cynicism to an ethos of caring and idealism. 
</P>
<P>
 As such, it did not require the President to win any specific legislative 
battles. All that was needed was for the Clintons to articulate an ethical 
vision of what America could be, instruct their Administration to endorse only 
programs that could be easily understood to be derived from that vision and 
then to put forward and fight for legislation that embodied the vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Clintons refused to fight for their own ideals. The moment 
cynical media began to ridicule the notion that people could be motivated by 
something besides self-interest, the Clintons, instead of standing their ground 
and fighting, quickly abandoned their politics of meaning and turned toward 
opportunism. Those who had supported the Clintons were astounded to find the 
highest priorities being given to programs like deficit reduction and the North 
American Free Trade Agreement or a massive jail-building and death-penalty 
expanding project called the crime bill -- all of which seemed more designed to 
win the hearts of traditional conservatives or to demonstrate that Clinton 
could win legislative battles that showed how "presidential" (that is, playing 
the game the way the press and Washington insiders wanted) he could be. 
</P>
<P>
 If the President himself seemed unable to stand up for the notion of 
transcending selfishness, if he seemed to be putting his own narrow political 
well-being over the need to stand strong for principles, most Americans quickly 
concluded that they would have to be fools to risk their own self-interest. 
Though they momentarily hoped that things could be different and responded to 
Clinton's call for change when that seemed to be his agenda, they had been 
burned too frequently to stay loyal to a vision of politics that seemed to call 
for self-sacrifice (higher taxes, higher health-care premiums or at least the 
need to navigate a bureaucratic maze) if those who called for change really 
didn't believe it possible themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats like to blame their current problems on the Republicans and the 
monied interests. It is certainly true that many of the elites of wealth and 
power in America threw enormous resources into blocking the best parts of 
Clinton's legislative program. Fearful that he was serious about "change," 
these elites and their allies in both parties in Congress were willing to 
thwart the will of the American majority on many issues in order to try to make 
Clinton look ineffective. And the moment Clinton took office, he was subjected 
to an unprecedented assault by media determined to expose his weaknesses, 
highlight his vacillations on his own principles and undermine his popular 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 But Americans are not dispirited because Clinton failed to get his program 
through Congress, but rather because Clinton failed to fight for a coherent 
vision of a more caring and less cynical America. The most influential 
presidents of the postwar years have not been those who were most effective in 
passing legislation (Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter, for 
example) but those who managed to popularize their vision of what the country 
needed. President John F. Kennedy managed to legitimate an ethos of idealism in 
the country that created the context for social movements that went far beyond 
anything Kennedy himself had contemplated. President Ronald Reagan, on the 
other hand, legitimated an ethos of selfishness that set the framework of 
assumptions that even today continues to underlie people's desires for lower 
taxes and less government. 
</P>
<P>
 And this is what Clinton could have done too, even though assuming office with 
less than an electoral majority and even though he faced a hostile press and 
fearful ruling elites. Clinton's one undeniable strength was his ability to 
listen to people and validate their concerns. He was in a perfect position to 
show the American public that their hunger for meaning and purpose that could 
transcend the me-firstism and narcissism being generated by the competitive 
marketplace would best be addressed by developing a new communitarian ethos. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton could have challenged the extremes of individualism in both the 
conservative and liberal traditions -- and argued for the need of a new 
commitment to each other. He could have developed legislation aimed not at 
pleasing congressional conservatives but at educating an American public to 
what kind of country would be possible for them if the bottom line in America 
was switched from selfishness to mutual responsibility and solidarity. Clinton 
could have lost every electoral battle and nevertheless increased his 
popularity and that of his party had he been understood to be fighting for a 
society based on caring and had his Administration become the lightning rod in 
the struggle against cynicism. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, this perception of Clinton's willingness to lose legislative 
battles would have given him the popularity to make those losses less likely. 
Similarly, had his fight for health care not been crippled by a desire to 
compromise with the profit interests of the insurance companies, he could have 
designed a plan that was far less a bureaucratic monstrosity, perhaps a variant 
of single-payer versions, that would have rallied far more popular support than 
the plan with which he eventually lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, then, is the tragedy of Clinton. He is a good man, but a scared man. And 
his fears are transparent and get communicated to the rest of the country. If 
even the President of the United States doesn't have the backbone to fight for 
a vision that could transcend selfishness, then how are ordinary citizens 
supposed to do that in their personal lives? The task seems impossible. So 
people return to the ethos of Reagan/Bush, but they do so not out of great joy, 
but in deep disappointment -- because most Americans, while doubting that a 
world based on idealism is possible, nevertheless wish it were. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder, then, that so many people are depressed. They feel angry and 
suckered by the Democrats. They wonder if it will ever be possible to 
reconstitute an America based on principles that transcend the selfishness and 
me-firstism of the market. And though in the end they may rally to the 
Democrats on Election Day for fear of the even worse consequences of 
Republicans who proudly proclaim the principles of market selfishness as the 
basis of salvation, they will do so without enthusiasm and without much hope.  
</P>
<P>
 Unless Clinton can recast his presidency as a crusade for principles in the 
next two years -- and reconstitute a serious campaign for a poltics of meaning 
-- you can expect this collective emotional depression to deepen in the years 
ahead. And in such a climate, you can expect that the Christian Right and 
others who flourish in climates of despair to deepen their influence and impact 
in American politics.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE O.J. SIMPSON CASE; TURN CAMERAS ON, GAG THE LAWYERS; A 
SEASONED TRIAL REPORTER BELIEVES THE ATTORNEY MANIPULATION OF THE MEDIA 
JUSTIFIES HER CHANGE OF HEART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THEO WILSON, Theo Wilson covered many national trials for the N.Y. Daily 
News, including those of Sam Sheppard, the Boston Strangler, Charles Manson, 
Sirhan Sirhan, Son of Sam, Jean Harris, Claus von Bulow and John DeLorean. She 
has left the business and is writing a book about the trials. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judge Lance A. Ito may rule today on whether the camera inside the O.J. 
Simpson trial room should be removed. I am a reporter who for 30 years covered 
more high-profile trials in this country than any other person I know. 
</P>
<P>
 When cameras were introduced into courtrooms, I spoke out in the press, on TV 
networks and on the radio in their favor, because I fought for decades to have 
more open courts. I did this even though I knew, as a print reporter, that the 
use of cameras and tape recorders at trials would give TV and radio their first 
opportunity to take over what had become the last great newspaper story -- the 
high-profile trial. But I believed then, and I believe now, that cameras give 
the public their real right to know what happens in the courts, and I urge 
Judge Ito not to black out the public. 
</P>
<P>
 But what I also urge him to do -- and I am making a complete and startling 
reversal of my lifetime beliefs -- is to issue a gag order on the lawyers on 
both sides. The worst problem of the Simpson trial emanates from what is 
happening outside the courtroom. As a generation of reporters who worked with 
me will tell you, I always instructed them to "stay inside the courtroom, that 
is your job, to bring the public inside the trial, where a judge is in charge 
and where the most important part of your story is what the jury hears from the 
witness stand." 
</P>
<P>
 The out-of-court coverage has been appalling since early on, but for me it 
came to a head recently. In what The Times wisely described as a "carefully 
choreographed" plan, defense attorneys went outside the courtroom to denounce 
prosecutors for allegedly treating black prospective jurors differently than 
others. They did not make this accusation to the judge in court and in the 
presence of the prosecutors, but to the media alone.  
</P>
<P>
 I would never have used such an accusation in a story until it was made in 
open court. But that was then, and this is now, and I realized to my horror 
that if I were covering the Simpson trial, I would have had to go along with 
this manipulation. I find that demeaning, unprofessional, unethical. I do not 
fault the defense attorneys. They are doing what they are paid to do, 
everything possible to win for their client, just as everything the prosecution 
says and does is to try to win a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 What I find appalling is the fact that at this trial, because of the 
overwhelming force of the electronic press, even a reporter who would not want 
to use any accusation until it was made in court is forced into doing so. That 
the media can be manipulated and pulled without protest into publicizing 
whatever the defense -- or prosecution -- wants them to do is wrong. It is 
going to leave the media in even a worse position than they are right now, when 
polls show that the public has lost all trust in newspapers, TV or radio.  
</P>
<P>
 There is only one way to stop the out-of-court acrobatics and that is to issue 
a gag order. This will astound the judges and lawyers and reporters with whom I 
worked. I have been unalterably opposed to gag rules and fought through 
difficult times before the courts ruled that a judge may gag his court 
officers, but cannot gag the press. I used to say that only insecure judges 
issued gag rules. Now, however, I am making a complete turnaround because of 
what is happening outside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 When defense attorneys Howard Weitzman and Donald Re spoke on the federal 
courthouse steps where John DeLorean was on trial, they mainly were filling in 
the TV and radio reporters barred from the court. The prosecutors would have 
been wise to do likewise. Those remarks were entirely different from the 
out-of-court statements, theories and accusations that the Simpson press has 
been feeding on.  
</P>
<P>
 Judge Ito, please give the public a break and keep the camera in the 
courtroom. Issue a gag order to stop the prejudicial comments being fed to an 
unquestioning and rather naive media. And, oh yes, sequester the jury. Jack 
Ruby's jury in Dallas was sequestered in the jail; the Simpson jury could be 
given much better treatment in a hotel, and could concentrate on the trial if 
they did not have to go home every night facing possible contamination and 
family problems. (What the Jack Ruby trial needed was not sequestration but a 
change of venue. But that's a whole other story.)

 KEEP TALKING, BUDDY, IT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOOD AT 
</P>
<P>
 It ain't bragging if you can back it up, but after a week of pregame taunts 
Buddy Ryan's Arizona Cardinals fell on their beaks again Sunday with the usual 
pratfall, a 17-7 beating in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan had cut up his old offensive coordinator, Rich Kotite, now the Eagle 
coach, saying if Kotite had done his job better, they might have won a playoff 
game in their time together in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan took credit for the success of Eagle defensive coordinator Bud Carson, 
who has kept the unit together despite losing most of Ryan's stars: Reggie 
White, Jerome Brown, Clyde Simmons, Seth Joyner. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ryan on a radio show to Eagle linebacker Byron Evans: "I tell ya, I look 
at those films -- did you change any terminology? 'Cause you're doing 
everything we did when we were there five years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 To give Ryan his due, his attack philosophy revolutionized NFL defenses in the 
'80s but he also has split every team he has coached in the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chicago, he challenged Coach Mike Ditka, sneering that all Ditka knew about 
the defense, he learned when Ryan put the game plan on his desk. 
</P>
<P>
 In Philadelphia, Ryan's defenders, including Joyner, put the rap on the 
offense for whatever happened, even after Buddy had left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seth tried to be a leader," said Eagle center Dave Alexander. "What he wanted 
was for this team to win. He just did it in a way that rubbed a lot of people 
the wrong way. If we'd play a bad game, he'd criticize you in the paper." 
</P>
<P>
 In one season at Houston, Ryan threw a punch at offensive coordinator Kevin 
Gilbride. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Ryan was a month into the season with the Cardinals, he had humiliated 
quarterback Steve Beuerlein, who is now protesting Ryan's Neanderthal offensive 
philosophy publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyner and several other former Eagles have rallied around Ryan in Arizona but 
all they have managed to accomplish so far is a new standard in trash talking. 
</P>
<P>
 Said an unrepentant Joyner: "I've had a lot of people here tell me, 'If this 
is the type of cancer they're trying to cut out in Philadelphia, if they've got 
any more they want to cut out, tell them to ship it down here.' " CAN YOU HOLD 
THAT PARADE UP MICHIGAN AVENUE A WEEK? 
</P>
<P>
 The story of the season in Chicago is the quarterback controversy involving 
Erik Kramer and Steve Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer, the high-priced free agent, had a 1-3 record in four starts for the 
Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh, the humble backup, had gone 3-0 when Kramer was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Dave Wannstedt tried to stand behind Kramer but on Sunday finally 
started Walsh, who ran his record to 4-0 with a 20-6 victory over Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Steve played extremely well," said Wannstedt. "He was in control 
out there the entire game. They did enough blitzing to where he had to make 
decisions at the line to put us in the right plays and he did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Bears were playing the Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week: the Miami Dolphins. AND WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THAT FREROTTE FEVER? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe he caught it. 
</P>
<P>
 Gus Frerotte, the Washington Redskins' seventh-round draft choice, pronounced 
"the real thing" by countless TV analysts despite the scanty evidence -- two 
games -- played like a rookie in a 37-22 loss to the San Francisco 49ers, 
throwing two interceptions, including one that Tim McDonald returned 73 yards 
for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Frerotte was replaced by John Friesz with the Redskins behind, 24-3. 
NOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 Miami's Keith Byars caught a pass in his 112th consecutive game, the 
seventh-longest streak in history. . . . Dan Marino completed 12 of 16 passes 
for 123 yards in the fourth quarter, including one incompletion that occurred 
when he spiked the ball to stop the clock. That was more completions, attempts 
and yards than the two Colt quarterbacks combined for in the entire game. . . . 
Mel Gray's 91-yard kickoff return for a touchdown for Detroit was the first 
against Green Bay since Nov. 24, 1985, when Ron Brown of the Rams scored on an 
86-yarder. . . . Green Bay tight end Ed West caught four passes, moving him 
past Phillip Epps into 10th place on the Packers' all-time list with 184 
receptions. Epps caught 182 passes from 1982-88. . . . The Falcons wore decals 
on the backs of their helmets that read "WZ" in memory of Darwin (Whitey) 
Zimmerman, the only equipment manager in team history. Zimmerman died at his 
home Thursday night. . . . Atlanta's Andre Rison failed to catch a pass in a 
game for the first time since Dec. 23, 1990. . . . San Francisco's victory 
improved George Seifert's record to 75-23 (.765) in his sixth season as a head 
coach, putting him at 75 victories faster than any coach in history. The 
previous fastest to 75 was former Brown and Bengal Coach Paul Brown, who 
reached that mark in 101 games. . . . Washington's Henry Ellard leads the NFL 
with 965 receiving yards. . . . Warren Moon moved into sixth place on the 
all-time completion list. Moon was 33 of 57 for 420 yards, giving him 2,857 
completions. He moved past Johnny Unitas into seventh place with a 10-yard pass 
to Cris Carter in the first quarter, and past Steve DeBerg into sixth with a 
13-yard touchdown pass to Jake Reed in the third. Topping 400 yards for the 
first time since Nov. 10, 1991, against Dallas, Moon became the seventh player 
in NFL history to pass for more than 36,000 yards. He now has 36,161, along 
with 21,228 in the CFL. TONIGHT'S GAME: N.Y. Giants at Dallas 
</P>
<P>
 6 p.m., Channel 7 
</P>
<P>
 Despite losing five consecutive games, Giant quarterback Dave Brown saved his 
job for one more week by playing decently against the Lions last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown completed 19 of 25 passes, but for only 159 yards as the Giants lost in 
overtime. Similar performances made him the toast of New York through the first 
three weeks of the season because the Giants were undefeated then, and running 
back Rodney Hampton was carrying the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hampton was injured in the third week, and he only returned to form last 
week (138 yards in 30 carries). That was one reason Brown's performance 
improved. If Hampton can maintain that level, the Giants (3-5) have a chance.  
</P>
<P>
 But both will have problems against the Dallas defense, which got a wake-up 
call from another unproven quarterback in the Bengals' Jeff Blake. It's hard to 
think that the Cowboy defense -- No. 2 in the NFL -- will be caught flat-footed 
for two consecutive weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Giant return specialist Dave Meggett, who returned a punt for a 
touchdown last week, can make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys (7-1) think they haven't played as well as they should have this 
season. The scary thing is that they might be right. But with Troy Aikman and 
Emmitt Smith leading the offense, it hasn't mattered yet. OUR RAMBOS ARE 
POPULAR ALL OVER 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, trying to choose between residences in Orange County, St. Louis and 
Baltimore, are still sorting through their offers. It's an exciting time for 
the Chamber of Commerce types, though less so for football fans in all three 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baltimore Sun recently polled readers on their preference for presumably 
available teams, which also include the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 4,403 respondents. Their choices: 
</P>
<P>
 14.5% for the Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
 41.7% for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 43.8% for no team. THE GAME OF THIS WEEK WON'T BE 'TIL NEXT WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 The world is already all atwitter over next week's Dallas Cowboy-San Francisco 
49er game at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Niners are 7-2, winners of four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys are 7-1, winners of five in a row going into tonight's game at 
Dallas against the New York Giants, who are two-touchdown underdogs. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers are considered to have the advantage of having just played against a 
Cowboy-style offense, that of Washington's Norv Turner, former Cowboy offensive 
coordinator. Many of the 49ers' personnel moves were made with the Cowboys in 
mind. For example, the 49ers reportedly wanted defensive back Deion Sanders 
because he would shut down wide receiver Michael Irvin. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams met three times in the previous two seasons -- and the Cowboys won 
them all: 30-20 at Candlestick Park in the 1992 NFC title game; 26-17 at Dallas 
last season; and 38-21 in the 1993 NFC title game at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers spent their week pinching themselves, trying to avoid looking ahead 
and getting upset by the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched the Eagles game (a replay of the game the 49ers lost, 40-8)," said 
center Bart Oates. That will keep us from looking ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers stayed awake long enough to win easily. The Cowboys are giving 
themselves the same pep talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't be fooled because the Giants lost five games in a row," said tackle 
Russell Maryland. "We're kidding ourselves if we look ahead to San Francisco. . 
. ." INJURY UPDATE 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit Lion quarterback Scott Mitchell, a bust after signing an $11.1-million 
contract as a free agent, suffered a broken bone in his right hand when hit by 
Reggie White of the Green Bay Packers, and will be sidelined indefinitely. . . 
. Miami Dolphin fullback Keith Byars left the game against the Indianapolis 
Colts in the second quarter because of ligament damage in his right knee. He 
will have a magnetic resonance imaging test today. . . . Miami halfback Bernie 
Parmalee left in the third quarter because of injuries to his right knee and 
right shoulder. He also will have an MRI on his knee today. QUOTEWORTHY

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; FINDING A PLACE OF LIFE IN THE SHADOW OF DEATH; 
RECESSIONAL BY JAMES A. MICHENER , RANDOM HOUSE $25, 400 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Recessional" is about life among the elderly residents, living and dying, at 
the Palms, a Florida retirement home. Andy Zorn, a young obstetrician who has 
lost his license in a scurrilous lawsuit, is hired to manage it, with an eye to 
increasing profits. 
</P>
<P>
 He elects to drive from Chicago to Tampa in icy weather and near Chattanooga 
he is involved in a horrible multivehicle accident in which a young woman's 
legs are amputated below the knees. 
</P>
<P>
 Moved by his humane instincts, Zorn aids Betsy Cawthorne and probably not only 
saves the young woman's life but also her chance of walking again. This 
encounter leads to romance when she comes to the Palms for rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palms has three sectors: the Gateway, a residential home; Assisted Living, 
for residents who need daily care; and Extended Care, for those in need of 
around-the-clock care.  
</P>
<P>
 The intellectual core of the Palms is a group of four men who call themselves 
the Tertulia , which is Spanish for a salon-type gathering. They are a former 
senator, a Colombian editor, a diplomat and a college president. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tertulia amuse themselves and prove their daring and skills by building an 
full-scale airplane in their quarters, fitting it with an engine and 
successfully test flying it over the extensive grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Zorn is ably assisted in his effort to make the Palms successful by his 
second-in-command, Ken Krenek, who knows the ropes and isn't ambitious to be 
the boss, and by Nora Varney, a huge nurse who uses her Alabama accent only 
when she wants to. 
</P>
<P>
 Zorn is doing well until he is challenged by Clarence Hasselbrook, a sinister 
agent for Life Is Sacred, a nationwide organization that opposes euthanasia. 
Hasselbrook has the ear of the press; he moves into the Palms to keep an eye on 
Zorn, and threatens to ruin him with a lawsuit for assisting in the suicide of 
Jaqmeel Reed, a terminally ill athlete. Hasselbrook also threatens to hang the 
nickname Murder Mansion on Extended Care.  
</P>
<P>
 He uses legal action to invalidate living wills by which hopelessly moribund 
residents can speed their escape. Finally, however, he himself is undone by 
John Taggart, head of the Palms empire of retirement homes, who tapes his 
threats against Zorn and the Palms. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Betsy Cawthorne is progressing miraculously under a wizard 
therapist, Bernard Yancey, who has her fitted with artificial legs and soon has 
her walking. Betsy decides to make her "maiden flight" in the rehab gym before 
her father, Yancey and Zorn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then with her confidence bolstered, she took a series of steps that were 
miraculously normal." 
</P>
<P>
 Zorn is dumbfounded, as is everyone else, but the reader has no doubt that 
this is the climax. Zorn's fate is sealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Betsy invites Zorn to her apartment and, after a couple of drinks, leads 
him to her bedroom. The reader is not introduced to the mechanics of their 
lovemaking, but has no doubt it was accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 There is love between other couples as well, even when one has been afflicted 
with Alzheimer's, a disease that Michener explores in grim detail.  
</P>
<P>
 Berta Umlauf, who had the beastly job of caring for both her mother-in-law and 
her husband after they were stricken by Alzheimer's, says, "I can tell you 
better than anyone else that each of them approached death with no inner 
courage to make it a natural part of life, and no concern for those they would 
leave behind. I can only say that they died miserably and in ways that 
terrified both them and me." 
</P>
<P>
 When young Reed, the basketball star, lies dying of AIDS, he tells his doctor, 
"I've lost the battle. I've thrown my life away, and I want no aid, no 
sympathy. I just want to die." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jaqmeel," the doctor replies, "I respect you and I understand what you're 
saying. But you must remember that in this brutal game, we're on opposite 
sides: you try to die, and I try to keep you alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, "Recessional" is not the stuff of musical comedy. Its purpose 
evidently is to secure for the hopelessly afflicted the right to die, at the 
same time celebrating the miracles of modern medicine, as in the case of Betsy. 
</P>
<P>
 At the age of 87, James Michener seems preoccupied with the riddles of life 
and death. The Palms is a place of life, but it lies under death's shadow. We 
miss Michener's boundless zest for life in his earlier works. 
</P>
<P>
 Miraculously, like the Tertulia, he has built a cumbersome airplane, but it 
flies.

APARTHEID FOE'S SLAYING SPARKS FEAR IN S. AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The killing of a white church leader branded a traitor to his race because he 
condemned apartheid raised fears Sunday that political violence will again 
flare in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Police refused to speculate on why Johan Heyns, former head of the Dutch 
Reformed Church, was killed Saturday night by a single shot to the head. But 
others were convinced that Heyns was killed by extremists who opposed the 
direction in which he had taken his church. 
</P>
<P>
 President Nelson Mandela on Sunday mourned Heyns as a "soldier of peace." 
</P>
<P>
 "His untimely death is a loss to the South African nation as a whole, black 
and white," Mandela said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 66-year-old Heyns, head of the church from 1986 to 1990, had been a 
controversial figure for his anti-apartheid stances. His Dutch Reformed Church 
is the church of most Afrikaners, the descendants of Dutch settlers, and until 
the 1980s gave theological justification for the Afrikaner-led state's policies 
of racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything points to the fact that it was a political assassination," said 
Beyers Naude, a prominent theologian who was defrocked by the Dutch Reformed 
Church in 1963 for his outspoken opposition to apartheid. Naude was welcomed 
back into the church only this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Heyns died instantly when an attacker using a large-caliber rifle shot him 
through a window of his home in a bougainvillea-shaded neighborhood of 
Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
 Heyns had been playing cards with his wife and grandchildren, police said. The 
gunshot came from about six yards away. No one else was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was well planned, and it was professionally done. The person must have 
known exactly where to go and how to do it," Naude said. 
</P>
<P>
 Racial and political violence has decreased since the nation's first all-race 
election in April, and Mandela, South Africa's first black president, has 
called for reconciliation. Naude said Heyns' death was a warning "the struggle 
is not over."

ERWIN KNOLL; LONGTIME EDITOR OF THE PROGRESSIVE MAGAZINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Erwin Knoll, called by consumer advocate Ralph Nader "the most versatile 
progressive journalist in America" and branded a political foe by Richard 
Nixon, who placed him on the presidential enemies list, is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Knoll, the longtime editor of The Progressive magazine who successfully 
battled the government for the right to print secrets about the hydrogen bomb, 
apparently died of a heart attack in his sleep Wednesday, said Progressive 
publisher Matt Rothschild on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Knoll was 63. For 21 years, he was editor of the Madison-based monthly, which 
he described as an "ecumenical journal of the American left." 
</P>
<P>
 He was a celebrated and outspoken defender of free speech and a staunch 
opponent of militarism. He frequently appeared on PBS' "MacNeil-Lehrer 
NewsHour" with other regional editors. 
</P>
<P>
 A year after Knoll took over The Progressive, the magazine gained national 
attention when it tried to publish an article about the H-bomb based on 
information obtained from unclassified sources. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge granted the government an injunction barring the article's 
publication. But while the case was being appealed, several newspapers 
published much of the same information and the government dropped the case. The 
Progressive went ahead with the story. 
</P>
<P>
 Knoll said at the time that the articles demonstrated that "there are no 
secrets about the hydrogen bomb. The information the government claims to be 
secret is readily available." 
</P>
<P>
 "Erwin's death is a big loss for the 1st Amendment," said Raymond J. Dall'Osto 
of Milwaukee, one of the lawyers who represented the magazine in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Knoll, a native of Austria, became a U.S. citizen in 1946. Before joining The

3 SLAIN AT TOPLESS BAR AS OUSTED MAN RETURNS WITH GUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. LOPEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A gunman, apparently angry because he was thrown out of a topless bar, 
returned early Sunday morning and fired on startled patrons and employees, 
killing two people and wounding two others before he was shot dead by a club 
security guard. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman had "vowed to return and shoot the employees" when he and a friend 
were told to leave the 1st King topless bar in Gardena after they tried to 
visit a dancer in her dressing room, Gardena police said. The two men returned 
two hours later, about 1:30 a.m., Officer Joe Prado said, and one of them shot 
two security guards at the front door of the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman then walked inside the packed club and fired his semiautomatic 
handgun at patrons and employees, who dove on the floor and ducked under 
tables, Prado said. The man was killed by one of the guards he had wounded 
moments earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were searching for the gunman's friend Sunday after he reportedly fled 
in a car. Names of the gunman and the others killed, a customer and one of the 
guards, were not released Sunday pending notification of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other topless and striptease clubs, the 1st King bar is often frequented 
by tough customers, employees said. To prevent trouble, the bar has a metal 
detector at the front door, armed security guards and bouncers to watch over 
the dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 The white brick building at 14401 S. Western Ave. was closed Sunday. But 
grisly reminders of the crime were evident: a dried puddle of blood at the 
front door, where the guards were shot; 16 chalk circles drawn by detectives, 
where bullet casings had littered the sidewalk and parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said witnesses described the shooter and his friend as gang members. 
The two reportedly tried to force their way into a dressing room backstage 
where the dancers change outfits. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place is getting worse and worse," said dancer Yolanda Moore, 25, who 
came to the club after hearing about the shooting from a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men were thrown out of the club by one of the bouncers and began to 
make threats. "They vowed to return and shoot the employees," Prado said. "They 
apparently meant it." 
</P>
<P>
 After shooting the two guards at the door, police said, the gunman walked 
through the metal detector and apparently began firing indiscriminately. One of 
the guards, who had been hit in the leg, chased the gunman inside and fatally 
wounded him. The gunman was pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The other security guard, along with one of the customers, died a short while 
later at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, authorities said. A dancer and the wounded 
guard were reported in stable condition.

VALLEY CHRONICLE: DALMATIAN VISITORS UNLEASH ENTHUSIASM IN THE CLASSROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teacher Holly Dye's fourth-grade class at Pinecrest School went barking mad 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9-year-olds weren't possessed by left-over Halloween demons, but creatures 
of another ilk. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the uproar was a visit by two Dalmatians, brought by a member of 
the Burbank Kennel Club to the Northridge campus for purposes of instruction, 
as well as a bit of show and tell. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitation was the second in two years arranged by Dye, who reached into 
her own pocket to purchase the Pets & Me program from the University of 
Pennsylvania last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I read about the program in an educational magazine, I thought I might 
enrich our fourth-grade social studies instruction by using some of the 
program's suggested activities," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is a 300-page teachers guide containing numerous activities with 
animal themes to spark student interest in a variety of ordinary classroom 
subjects.  
</P>
<P>
 If students are studying art, for example, they might draw pictures of 
animals. If they're working on writing, they might write a story about their 
pets. 
</P>
<P>
 Dye sent off to the university's graduate school of education for the printed 
program, and, with help from the Burbank Kennel Club, tried out part of the 
program last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the dogs came to the school this time, we had discussions about pets 
and the obligations that come with having them," Dye says.  
</P>
<P>
 "The children painted pictures of animal homes and the animals that would go 
in them. They got to write papers about how they would deal with certain 
situations involving pets." 
</P>
<P>
 On D-Day (D=Dog), Gwertz first wowed the children by showing them a video 
about dogs that help handicapped people. One scene depicted how a dog -- 
leading a blind man -- saved him from falling into an open manhole. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the enthusiastic children were led out to the playing field and told to 
sit in a straight line. 
</P>
<P>
 Mac and Spreckles were about to steal the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leslie Selfridge, who is the dogs' owner and handler, had put them in cages 
in the shade to await the children coming out," Dye says. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the youngsters were seated, the 18-month-old male dog, Mac, walked down 
the line receiving the children's expressions of delight and hugs with 
equanimity and the occasional face lick. 
</P>
<P>
 Mac may be known in local canine circles as a dog on his way up in American 
Kennel Club competitions, but he could be a politician the way he works a 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 The children watched as Mac and Sprecklesshowed they could understand and obey 
verbal commands to do such things as jump over barriers and identify and 
retrieve objects. 
</P>
<P>
 The children applauded as if the dynamic duo were the Puppy Power Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard-nosed types might want to know how much Dye figures the kids learned 
while enjoying themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite a lot, she thinks. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things I did with the children was ask them to think what they 
would do in certain situations," Dye says, adding that their cognitive 
reasoning skills, sense of responsibility, as well as writing ability, were 
brought into play with this exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, when Sara Abrams was asked what she would do if her parents made 
her give up a dog because someone in the family was allergic to it, she 
answered that she would be sad, but that she would find it another home where 
it would be loved and happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley Gazzaniga was asked what she would do if, after having nursed a wounded 
owl back to health, she was told she had to give the bird to a government agent 
or licensed bird sanctuary. She answered that even if she didn't want to, she 
would turn the bird over to the proper authorities so it could lead a healthy 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Sciortino didn't have to think long about her response when asked what 
she would do if a friend came to her house and wanted to dress up the cat as if 
it were a stuffed animal. This "friend," according to the scenario, was very 
popular and might not come back if she couldn't have her way. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary, a 9-year-old with a healthy attitude, responded with the kind of common 
sense that would give most parents cause for celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who," she asked, "would want a friend like that?" Thrift Store Staff to Honor 
Man Who Called Fire Department 
</P>
<P>
 The man who saved the American Cancer Society's Northridge thrift shop has 
been found and volunteers are planning a dinner in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the end of the story that began like this: 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of weeks ago Jill Angel, the store manager, came to work to find that 
a fire had started and been extinguished during the night.  
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters told her the whole shop, and possibly the shopping center would 
have burned down if an unidentified man hadn't alerted the Fire Department 
around midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel and her staff put a sign in the window asking their "angel" to stop in 
and identify himself. The request was repeated in last week's Chronicle column. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Wednesday, Dieter Balogh of Woodland Hills walked into the shop and said, 
"I guess I'm the man you are looking for." He said friends had seen the sign in 
the window and others had called to tell him his deed had been written about in 
the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 He seemed perplexed by all the attention, Angel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he was standing outside talking to a friend after having dinner at 
Truly Yours, the restaurant next door, when he saw a flash in our window." 
</P>
<P>
 "They went to investigate and saw a spark from one of the lights in the window 
fall to the floor and burst into flame," Angel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Balogh couldn't get his car phone to work, so he went to a phone booth to call 
the Fire Department. His friend, John Merrill, a former Valley resident who was 
visiting from Ohio, took off on foot to the fire station a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 They waited until two fire units arrived and then left.  
</P>
<P>
 Balogh thought that was the end of it. He says he couldn't believe anyone 
would go to so much trouble to thank him. He did what anyone would have done, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel said she and about 70 volunteers are arranging a dinner at the shop in 
his honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't think he did much, but all the rest of us do." Overheard 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to write in Charles Keating for both governor and senator. Just 
being pragmatic. We already know what he is. He doesn't have to get elected to 
prove it to us." 
</P>

THEATER REVIEW; A FEMALE LEGACY; 'JAR THE FLOOR' A MOVING PORTRAIT OF MOTHERS, 
DAUGHTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A friend once had a dream that she was strangling her mother. She then pushed 
her mother out of the way and began to strangle a strange woman in a 1920s 
dress. Next in line for strangling was another unknown woman, decked out circa 
1880. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl L. West's "Jar the Floor," now at South Coast Repertory, is like that 
dream, only fleshed out with great dialogue and infinitely more moving. 
</P>
<P>
 Centering on four generations of African American women, "Jar the Floor" 
explores the legacy of guilt and hostility that is passed from even the most 
loving mother to a daughter, and at the same time it shows that particular 
intimacy to be innately funny and wonderful. "Jar the Floor" breaks through 
many cliches of mother-daughter relations to embrace a household that is full 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Conflict is inevitable because each of the women has, in her distinctive way, 
an out-sized personality. MaDear (Fran Bennett) is a crotchety 
great-grandmother whose 90th-birthday celebration is the focus of the play. 
While MaDear can suddenly transform into the soul of a vulnerable young woman 
whose mother made her feel unspeakably ugly and worthless, she can, just as 
suddenly, say to her own daughter, "Gal, I should have killed you when you was 
born."  
</P>
<P>
 MaDear's favorite habits of Bible reading and viewing soap operas is 
interrupted on this busy day. She lives with her granddaughter, MayDee, in 
MayDee's pleasant townhouse, done in soothing pine. Attractively designed by 
Emily T. Phillips, it is a modern place where a cordless phone shares a wall 
with a beautiful turn-of-the-century broom and brass dustpan and with a 
collection of Aunt Jemima-type dolls, which seem to signal this family's 
connection with and possession of the pain of its African American past. 
Ancient wrongs hang over the household, although the characters never make 
speeches about it.  
</P>
<P>
 MayDee (Juanita Jennings), a professor of African American studies at an 
unnamed Illinois university, is waiting to find out if she has tenure, which 
may be the reason she is tense and snappish. Her habit of sucking in her cheeks 
disapprovingly, however, indicates this is MayDee's natural expression.  
</P>
<P>
 In this family, overt misery tends to skip a generation. MayDee's mother, Lola 
(Ann Weldon), is a high-spirited sexpot who "went straight from crawlin' to 
swishin' (her) behind." She is also a naturally hilarious person who merrily 
accepts MaDear's judgment that her Louis Vuitton handbag is hideous ("Glad I 
didn't buy you one," she answers her mother, who shoots back, "You and me both 
happy 'bout that."). Lola pouts emphatically when making a point, such as in a 
generational disagreement with MayDee about oral sex. "I told him my mouth was 
a sanctuary!" she says, bristling with showy indignation. 
</P>
<P>
 To complete the family saga, in walks the college-age Vennie (the stunning 
Jackie Mari Roberts) with her white lover, Raisa (Jodi Thelen), a visibly 
altered mastectomy survivor. Lola is immediately offended ("If Vennie gonna be 
that way, she could at least got herself a black girl with two breasts!"), 
while MayDee struggles vainly to be accepting and, most unexpectedly, MaDear 
recognizes a fellow fighter who is also close to death. In Thelen's winning 
performance, Raisa's warm smile touches MaDear in a place her own family cannot 
seem to reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Benny Sato Ambush directs this superb and attractive cast, expertly shifting 
attention from one of Weldon's priceless expressions of outrage to Bennett's 
stubbornness to Jennings's disapproval to Roberts' youthful fluidity in the 
course of the play's many dilemmas. Weldon is especially good in a scene in 
which Lola holds back tears while watching her mother's face light up at the 
(probably made-up) news that Lola's favored brother contributed to a present 
she is presenting.  
</P>
<P>
 "Jar the Floor" drags a little in its second act, particularly in the showdown 
between MayDee and Vennie, which, if trimmed, could be riveting. MayDee dotes 
on her daughter while steadfastly and sourly refusing to recognize Vennie's 
choices in both career and in love. When Vennie confronts her mother with, "You 
don't even like me!" the news is so undeniable that it startles both of them. 
MayDee does, of course, love her daughter, as do all the terrible, wonderful 
mothers in this family. Cheryl West's gift is that she makes ancient wrongs 
fresh and ancient love enduring. She jars the floor as well as the soul with 
all this complicated love.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; SANDRA BERNHARD AT PANTAGES: THE LADY ALSO SINGS (SORTA) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Can Sandra Bernhard sing, you want to know? Well, yes, actually. Should she? 
That's another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernhard is a first-class provocateur , and near-first-class raunchy 
raconteur. In concert Friday night at the Pantages, the would-be chanteur also 
referred to herself -- in a rare non-ironic moment -- as an "artist." 
</P>
<P>
 What the art form is, though, is hard to decipher. Beyond the intermittently 
amusing, routinely profane, self-important and hyper-glib facade, Bernhard 
really doesn't have much to say. But it seems important to her that she be 
allowed to say it in every medium. 
</P>
<P>
 Music isn't necessarily the least appropriate medium conceivable for her, uh, 
gifts. As for attitude, she's rock 'n' roll all the way, prowling the stage in 
a hiked-up black leather mini-dress, a not-so-kittenish jaguar (or Jagger) with 
a whip, fronting a quite good six-piece band she's dubbed the Strap-Ons. 
</P>
<P>
 The swagger came in handy on some of the more latently parodic, blatantly 
bitchy material -- like a "50 Ways to Leave Your Lover" that actually rocked 
out in the gender-updated chorus, or (the night's highlight) an unlikely medley 
of Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Everything's All Right" and Jimi Hendrix's "Manic 
Depression" that made a neurotic sense in its weird wavering between sugary 
sweetness and Prozac-free power chords. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, there was no reasonable reason to indulge in a lugubrious "Sympathy 
for the Devil," other than that lips of a feather flock together. 
</P>
<P>
 What Bernhard seemed to be going for here was some sort of unholy cross 
between Laurie Anderson, Amanda McBroom and Shecky Greene. The original 
material -- mostly improved versions of songs from her nigh unlistenable album, 
"Excuses for Bad Behavior, Part I" -- was all over the board. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Lonely Town," she drew unintended titters reciting the names of her dearly 
departed (including the guy who designed her drapes and "affirmed me as a woman 
and an artist") in the same Sunday-morning-soprano singing voice she'd used to 
spoof Lloyd Webber's bathos, and the same breathy speaking voice she'd used to 
parody phony show-biz patter at great length earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 When she melodramatically spoke of one buddy coming back as a specter to 
cajole her to fight to preserve reproductive choice, freedom of expression of 
sexual preference, et al., the idea of a ghost bothering to deliver a 
progressive-politics stump speech seemed like one of the cleverer satires of 
the show. Then you realized she was dead serious. 
</P>
<P>
 The mistake could have been avoided had we realized earlier how easy, and 
musty, most of her actual targets are: For some reason, seven years later, she 
seems to think there's a rich vein of humor in ridiculing Suzanne Vega's 
"Luka." 
</P>
<P>
 When Bernhard's attacks on the status quo are so fangless, it's little wonder 
her eventual attempts at a positive message ring hollow too. (Her exit line, 
curiously, is the same as ex-pal Madonna's: "Don't take any (expletive) from 
anybody.") Most of the Pantages audience seemed willing to regard her stance as 
the stuff of triumph, but so far -- all the will in the world and even some 
talent notwithstanding -- Bernhard hasn't nearly earned her sense of 
superiority.

 In response to the Counterpunch " 'Wood' Tarnishes a Good Man -- Lugosi" (Oct. 
24) by Lisa Mitchell: I respect and sympathize with Bela Lugosi Jr.'s concerns 
as to how his father was portrayed in the motion picture "Ed Wood," being a 
Lugosi fan myself. I had my own doubts about the cursing scenes, but, having 
seen the movie, I must say it works -- they immediately draw you to him. It 
takes him from being an unapproachable "monster" icon of the screen to being 
someone with whom we can identify. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie does take liberties with Lugosi's life, but then we must remember 
that this is a movie for entertainment purposes. It is a totally different 
milieu from a biography or documentary. It succeeds on a human level that will, 
hopefully, inspire people to follow up on its subject matter and get more 
accurate details.  
</P>
<P>
 It's interesting that Lugosi Jr. sees disrespect when Lugosi is kicked out of 
rehab, as if the movie were suggesting that he didn't have the courage to 
finish the treatment. What I saw was a clinic that was an enemy to Lugosi, a 
cruel and uncaring system that would kick this man out because of insurance 
reasons.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ed Wood" leaves you with a caring, hopeful and loving portrait, not only of a 
friendship between Wood and Lugosi but most of all of a man who was a great 
actor but a human one.

 Mitchell's claim that "Ed Wood" tarnishes the memory of Lugosi touches upon a 
wider issue -- the now common use of gutter language in films. Apparently 
Lugosi didn't speak in this manner, so why does it appear in the film? And why 
does a fine actor like Martin Landau agree to use it? Even more puzzling: What 
possessed Katharine Hepburn to use the F-word in "Love Affair"? What does such 
an esteemed lady gain by this? 
</P>
<P>
 This handful of grubby little words has long since lost any shock value. Let's 
call a moratorium. Better still, let's go for words of wit, style, pungency, 
acridity and luminescence.

COUNTERPUNCH LETTERS; THE BALLETIC BLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Serena Tripi, in her Counterpunch response to Martin Bernheimer's "Balletic 
Blight Still Plagues L.A." (Oct. 16), states that local dance groups need money 
and appreciation ("Dance Groups Need a Few Good Angels," Oct. 31). Who doesn't? 
She asks that we "concentrate on how to bring the audiences back into the 
theater." 
</P>
<P>
 My family has been a season ticket-holder for the Los Angeles Civic Light 
Opera, the musical comedy series at the Pasadena Civic and the Ahmanson Theater 
for many years. As season ticket-holders, our money goes out almost a year in 
advance. Sometimes we know what the shows will be, sometimes not. 
</P>
<P>
 We used to buy four season tickets. One season had so many mediocre or bad 
shows that we were embarrassed to take guests. We saw Robert Morse outshine his 
co-actor, Joe Namath, in "Sugar Babies." Namath was good-looking and agreeable 
but hardly up to singing and dancing. We suffered through an updated version of 
"Babes in Toyland" with "Star Wars" figures and cough-inducing smoke. We barely 
endured the torture of a too-loud "Tommy." Now our season has been cut short 
because the producers of "She Loves Me" are having trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Tripi asks, "Where is the dollar support for dance?" The answer is just 
another question. Where is the dance company that we can watch without paying 
$50 a ticket? A dance company with talented artists, not necessarily with names 
we should recognize? A dance company that produces more than "The Nutcracker" 
each Christmas? A dance company with some live music rather than a record? 
</P>
<P>
 Circumstances all conspire to deter audiences from putting up money for a show 
that may or may not happen. Perhaps if there were actually a tax deduction for 
patrons of the arts, the public might not mind parting with its hard-earned 
dollars. As it is, we are supporting very bad theater.

THEATER; 'MOCKINGBIRD' REVISITS ANOTHER ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The moral issues in Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird" are fairly simple: 
</P>
<P>
 Don't convict people of crimes they obviously didn't commit. Don't punish odd 
agoraphobics who slay brutish oafs in the process of defending innocent 
children. Obey your conscience, even if racists taunt you. 
</P>
<P>
 If all of this seems self-evident, you might want something thornier than 
Lee's tale about growing up in a small Alabama town in the mid-'30s. If not, 
Christopher Sergel's stage adaptation has opened the new season of La Mirada 
Theatre's professional theater series, now under the banner of executive 
producers Tom McCoy and Cathy Rigby. 
</P>
<P>
 Jules Aaron's staging of "Mockingbird" does provide a satisfying showcase for 
Bruce Davison as the practically perfect attorney Atticus Finch, for three 
superb child actors (Alex McKenna, John Graas, Jeremy Lelliott), and for a 
large cast of skilled character actors. It also demonstrates a serious level of 
commitment by the new producers of this previously struggling series. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mockingbird" was more daring when it was published in 1960 and filmed in 
1962, before the Civil Rights Act. Nowadays, Lee's story may have an unexpected 
patina of topicality, with its glance at the fallibility of juries in racially 
charged cases, but "Mockingbird" hardly ruffles anyone's feathers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a familiar story. The novel was a prize-winning bestseller, and the movie 
won an Oscar for Gregory Peck. Davison, thankfully, is lighter-voiced and less 
stentorian than Peck, though he retains an appropriately stiff gait. He's also 
more aggressive in his courtroom technique, thanks in part to Sergel's 
adaptation. Sergel tells the story more smoothly than Horton Foote's 
screenplay. But the atmosphere behind that story isn't as evocative as it was 
in the black-and-white film imagery. 
</P>
<P>
 The play sketches more of the townspeople, creating a richer sense of the 
community. A neighbor (Carrie Snodgress) of the Finch family narrates their 
adventures. Another neighbor (Zelda Rubinstein) gets to tell the story of scary 
Boo Radley, the apparently demented man who hasn't left his house in 20 years. 
The hateful Mrs. Dubose (Pat Atkins) is a hard-nosed racist in this version. 
And the black minister (Alvin Walker) has a higher profile, collecting money 
for the black man (Haven Mitchell) who has been accused of raping a white 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Rape is more openly talked about here. Indeed, little Scout (Alex McKenna) 
twice asks grown-ups to tell her what rape is, and her father provides an 
answer, of sorts. The judge, sensing that the courtroom testimony will get raw, 
takes a recess to allow women and children to leave -- which doubles as the 
play's intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 The story is still told primarily from the children's point of view. But its 
first and third parts, in which the kids are principal players, and the 
courtroom scene in the middle -- where they're primarily spectators -- are tied 
together more effectively than in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 The play eliminates one of the movie's central scenes, in which the children 
raid the Radley home, only to be terrified by a shadow and a gunshot. And it 
completely drops their perspective when they're finally put in real jeopardy, 
instead making it crystal clear who's attacking whom -- which makes the event 
less frightening. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergel went overboard in underlining who the real villain is; he even has the 
miscreant (Michael McCarty) threaten Atticus and spit in his face in the 
courtroom, instead of in a less public place. This seems unlikely.  
</P>
<P>
 John Iacovelli's set shrinks houses down to mere impressions of rambling 
Southern homes; these look more like big city stoop houses. This works only 
with the Radley home -- it keeps its sense of mystery because we see only a 
sharply jutting corner of it. 
</P>
<P>
 A few other scenic choices look awfully halfhearted. Only half of a 
representational courtroom is created; the court's witnesses sit on the former 
scene's porches, diluting the hothouse atmosphere. And the children are 
attacked in front of their home instead of in the dark woods; surely lighting 
designer Martin Aronstein should have done something to make this seem less 
far-fetched.

SCREENING ROOM: 'SEX, DRUGS' SHOWS THE NETHERLANDS' PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although rambling and repetitive, Jonathan Blank's important, comprehensive 
documentary, "Sex, Drugs and Democracy" (Friday at the Nuart for one week) 
reveals how effectively the Netherland's progressive society works in 
regulating, rather than banning, drugs and prostitution, and in providing civil 
rights for one and all. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, Holland's history as a small country of pragmatic traders has made 
for its unusually enlightened views. (310) 478-6379. 
</P>
<P>
 Far less effective, Victor Ginzburg's "The Restless Garden" (Friday at the 
Sunset 5 for one week), ostensibly surveys the crumbling Soviet Union's sexual 
revolution, but is mainly interested in presenting as many Russian beauties in 
the nude as possible; lots of arty dance sequences, one truly poignant moment 
when a breathtakingly gorgeous young woman talks in halting English of drifting 
into prostitution. (213) 848-3500. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Cinematheque's Eric Rohmer weekend retrospective at the Directors 
Guild commences Friday at 7:15 p.m. with his knockout first feature, "The Sign 
of Leo" (1959), perversely never released in the United States and actually 
more impressive and involving than such later prestige talkathons as "My Night 
at Maud's." 
</P>
<P>
 In a fable cleverly invoking the role of random fate and raising the question 
of whether we are our brother's keeper, irony compounds irony as a big, amiable 
American expatriate (burly Jess Hahn in a rare starring role) faces utter 
destitution as his French friends flee a sweltering Paris in August.  
</P>
<P>
 Also unfamiliar and equally outstanding, the astringent, acutely observant 
1967 "La Collectionneuse" (Saturday at 5 p.m.) stars Patrick Bauchau (who will 
speak after the screening) in a superb portrayal of a classically French erotic 
gamesman, a snobbish aesthete who condescends to -- but cannot quite dismiss -- 
the self-possessed young woman (Haydee Politoff) his friend unexpectedly brings 
along on a St. Tropez vacation. For full schedule: (213) 466-FILM. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Film Institute's eighth Americas Film Festival commences an 
11-day run Friday at the Monica 4-Plex with Sergio Cabrera's "The Strategy of 
the Snail," a wry, warm account of the residents of an old Bogota apartment 
house fighting off a demolition order. The film, which screens at 6:45 and 
9:15, became one of the most popular in Colombia's history and is that 
country's official entry into the Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
 An opening weekend standout is Adrian Rudomin's riveting, rigorous "Land of 
Darkness," (Saturday at 4 p.m.), a 75-minute USC student production starring 
John Rocha in a powerhouse portrayal of a young, idealistic priest mistakenly 
forced into the federal army during the Mexican Revolution, plunging him into a 
bitter and astonishing spiritual odyssey. (310) 394-9741. 
</P>
<P>
 In conjunction with "Zine Scream '94," a celebration of the self-publishing 
scene, Filmforum has come up with an appropriately outlandish program, 
screening at Hollywood Moguls tonight at 8, of short films, some of which are 
mainly an obscure blur, some merely tedious but others lots of fun. Perhaps the 
most accessible is Momita SenGupta's mischievous "Androgynous," about the 
honeymoon adventures of a cross-dressing couple -- she's a Sharon Stone type 
who dresses like a tough guy, he's a black man who wears dresses and makeup.  
</P>
<P>
 Greta Snyder's rightly disturbing "Our Gay Brothers" is a collage, mainly of 
old found footage, celebrating women in all their variety -- and also gay men, 
suggesting an alliance between the two -- while on the soundtrack we hear a 
group of gays discuss female sexuality in the crudest terms possible. 
</P>
<P>
 With "The Leash Men" Kurt Keppler reworks clips of men fishing to skewer 
deftly their sport while Michael Gitlin, using random snippets of dialogue and 
eerie visuals, evokes a highly contemporary aura of paranoia. Michael Le Haie 
and Jonathan Stein's "Critizen" is an affectionate portrait of San Francisco's 
Sean Bosker, a young intellectual prankster, who among other activities, has 
the courage to go to Fisherman's Wharf buck naked and ask the tourists, "Seen 
any good sights?"  
</P>
<P>
 Weirdest, most imaginative of all is Michael Collins' "This Is a Dead Boy," 
which intentionally or otherwise plays like a spoof of a Dennis Cooper novel in 
which the King of Bad News slays a boy, yanks out the kid's left eye, which 
goes on to have a life of its own. (213) 466-4143. For information about "Zine 
Scream '94," (213) 936-3039.

MUSIC REVIEWS; YAN PASCAL TORTELIER RISES IN L.A. PHILHARMONIC DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In prospect, the Los Angeles Philharmonic's fourth program of the new season 
seemed unpromising -- even after the scheduled guest conductor pulled out and 
the repertory was changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Donald Runnicles, music director of San Francisco Opera, 
canceled his Philharmonic dates, the official word being that he had "been 
forced to curtail his guest-conducting activities." A week later, the 
engagement of the 47-year-old French musician, Yan Pascal Tortelier, as well as 
a program two-thirds overhauled, was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 In the event, Friday night (repeated Saturday and Sunday), Tortelier's 
surprise debut had to cause rejoicing. Loud rejoicing. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a conductor who seems to know his business, who inspires sophisticated 
musicians into the kinds of alertness and brilliance they do not always 
deliver, who finds the lost character and pristine emotion in a work as 
familiar, and regularly unengaging, as Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 Tchaikovsky's Fifth ? Right. That overworked piece provided the climax to 
Tortelier's ear-opening program. In the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Friday 
night, it positively shone, its sense freshly minted, its motivations 
rethought, its ebb and flow restored. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philharmonic itself produced the aural beauties being heard, of course, 
but the urgency and pacing and irresistible continuity emanated from the 
podium. Tortelier -- a violinist of repute, he is the son of the late cellist, 
Paul Tortelier, and holds conducting posts in the British Isles -- seems to 
create an atmosphere of spontaneity. 
</P>
<P>
 Before this denouement, there were other happy surprises. Returning to the 
Pavilion's center stage, Silvia Marcovici imbued another repertory chestnut, 
Max Bruch's G-minor Violin Concerto, with renewed passion and vigor. The 
Romanian fiddler may not make a huge tone, but her sound is potent, her 
technique solid and her musicianship revelatory. She wore a slinky black gown 
-- making her a Morticia look-alike -- which only added to the strong 
impression of musical authority. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning of the evening, Tortelier and the orchestra did not deal in 
any dutiful warm-up, but in an apparently definitive performance of Ravel's 
kaleidoscopic "Rapsodie Espagnole." From the podium, the approach was sweeping, 
multicolored, probing; from the orchestra, myriad telling details emerged. A 
feast for the senses.

DANCE REVIEWS; O VERTIGO DANSE IN DEBT TO EUROPE FOR 'CHAMBRE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL * O Vertigo Danse performs "La Chambre Blanche" Friday at 8 p.m. 
at California Center for the Arts, 120 W. Grand Ave., Escondido. (619) 
738-4100. Tickets: $10-$25. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a one-act ritual of victimization, a Montreal-based ensemble named O 
Vertigo Danse forged a link between North American and European modernism that 
proved both instructive and frustrating Friday at the Wadsworth Theater in 
Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Danced inside an empty tiled room with high windows and skylight, Ginette 
Laurin's "La Chambre Blanche" invoked without ever really exploring ideas about 
confinement, social-versus-personal expression and gender issues. 
</P>
<P>
 However, an invigorating dose of New World physicality helped redeem (in part) 
the piece's heavy debt to the most grandiose trends in Neo-Expressionist 
European dance-theater. 
</P>
<P>
 With a single door leading to a shower, Stephane Roy's setting suggested an 
antique gymnasium inside a chateau, but Laurin insisted on creating some sort 
of self-service asylum, with 10 inmates -- dressed in either their underwear or 
chic black party clothes -- alternately bedeviling and consoling one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Periodically, her dancers would look (or stretch) longingly toward the light 
or run around and up the walls like caged animals, but most of "La Chambre 
Blanche" consisted of showpiece dancing: intricate gymnastic duets, propulsive 
group playoffs contrasting male and female energy -- plus demonstrations of 
stylistic versatility. (The six O Vertigo women, for instance, were obliged 
during the evening to dance barefoot, in heels and in pointe slippers.) 
</P>
<P>
 A mournful score by Michel Drapeau invited you to consider the deepest 
implications of the action, but the deliberately splintered continuity of the 
work discouraged interpretation. Indeed, "La Chambre Blanche" appeared so 
arbitrary in its development and dramatic frissons, there was no reason why it 
couldn't have lasted seven hours or seven minutes instead of 75. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles' own Diavolo Dance Theater offers a far more purposeful and 
persuasive investigation of similar themes in Jacques Heim's forceful "Tete au 
Carre." But what O Vertigo has that Diavolo hasn't is 10 spectacular soloists. 
</P>
<P>
 With every member of the Canadian company revealing technique and intensity to 
burn on Friday, "La Chambre Blanche" became an unwieldy but ultimately 
compelling divertissement. Laurin may lack the structural savvy and sense of 
breathtaking velocity honed by her compatriot and rival, Edouard Lock of La La 
La Human Steps. However, her genuine talent for adagio expression -- and the 
ravishing softness of her style in such passages -- repaid the closest 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no small achievement to make beautiful movement and to inspire fine 
dancers to the highest standards of performance. Why compromise that 
accomplishment with pretensions borrowed from abroad? Like many 
French-Canadians, Laurin belongs to two cultures, two worlds -- but only one of 
them really nurtured her abilities on Friday. LEWIS SEGAL * O Vertigo Danse 
performs "La Chambre Blanche" Friday at 8 p.m. at California Center for the 
Arts, 120 W. Grand Ave., Escondido. (619) 738-4100. Tickets: $10-$25.

DANCE REVIEWS; NEW VIGOR, LIFE AT RHAPSODY IN TAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dancers in Rhapsody in Taps often look so glazed and slick in their 
displays of technique that a performance can be wildly animated yet strangely 
lifeless: the tap of the living dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, signs of hope intruded on the locally based company's annual festival 
of steps and painted smiles Saturday at the Japan America Theatre.For starters, 
new recruit Bob Carroll enforced a redemptive rough-edged vigor in his 
improvisational "Night Watch" solo. Plenty of tap fireworks too, with startling 
changes of impetus coming from nowhere, over and over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cheatin' the Snake" by guest choreographer-composer Keith Terry managed to 
showcase all six dancers in the company while inventively denying the most 
mannered among them their usual strategies of audience-courting. Hand- and 
body-clapping, sequencing ploys and elegant spatial patterns added to its 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Two new solos by artistic director Linda Sohl-Donnell confirmed her technical 
excellence, with "Footprints" also capitalizing on her lyric line. But here and 
elsewhere on the program the clatter of fast tapping clashed with slow, moody 
music played by the company's fine five-member band. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Two Ta' Tambour," Sohl-Donnell's tapping adroitly embellished the 
percussion solos of M. B. Gordy, and she seemed fully awake and responsive to 
the moment -- qualities sometimes missing when she danced alongside others in 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
 For all its praiseworthy proficiency, Rhapsody in Taps works a very narrow 
range of tap expression -- one so lightweight it scarcely qualifies as concert 
dance. But its latest experiments are undeniably encouraging. And overdue.

 Rinde Eckert's "The Gardening of Thomas D.", in its L.A. premiere Friday in 
Freud Playhouse at UCLA, is an uptown performance-art take on "Field of 
Dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, a disaffected but of course brilliant and moral accountant played by 
Eckert, has a spiritual crisis and/or a stroke in a supermarket.Through the 
agency of an angel-girlfriend (Ellie Klopp,) he finds redemption of sorts in 
reseeding an abandoned baseball field at a monastery. 
</P>
<P>
 It's sort of Dante meets Voltaire meets Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that Thomas isn't a character anyone can care much about. He is 
self-absorbed, loquacious, obtuse. He doesn't appreciate the angel-girlfriend 
for what she is, although she gives him critical advice -- and a shovel. His 
crisis seems contrived and unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckert, author of the piece, was a resourceful and versatile artist in 
assuming several voices and characterizations -- some amusing, some deadly -- 
during the long 80-minute work. He only fitfully, however, engaged empathy. 
</P>
<P>
 Klopp embodied common sense attractively and negotiated the chain-link fence 
representing the heavens or some such adroitly. 
</P>
<P>
 That fence was part of the most absorbing element of the production -- 
Alexander V. Nichols' ingenious set design -- a section of bleachers that 
served to suggest circles of Hell as well as seating for a baseball diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols also did the lighting and shared direction with Eckert and Melissa 
Weaver. Ten other people and a technical company received credit for the 
production as well. No one, however, was credited for providing the sand and 
the peat moss.CHRIS PASLES

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; ATKINS TOUR GIVES SUZY BOGGUSS A BOOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Suzy Bogguss' high-profile tour with legendary guitarist Chet Atkins, which 
stopped at the Universal Amphitheatre on Saturday night, may be just what she 
needs to move her up a notch commercially in the crowded field of female 
country singers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bogguss has long been stuck in that second line of country artists, looking up 
at the Rebas and Wynonnas.Though she has the talent to leap forward, she rarely 
gets the kind of fancy showcasing she's getting on this tour in support of 
"Simpatico," her duet album with Atkins. 
</P>
<P>
 While Bogguss certainly glistened in this very pleasing show, you could see 
what's been holding her back. Her style, as lilting and sensuous as it may be, 
doesn't seem that original. At times, you hear an echo of the Judy Collins of 
20 years ago. Other times she's a bargain-basement Linda Ronstadt, with a high 
and lovely voice -- just not as high or quite as lovely as Ronstadt's. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Bogguss can be a knockout ballad singer. Her voice has that wistful 
ache needed to put across mournful ballads such as "Sorry Seems to Be the 
Hardest Word" and "Two Shades of Blue." 
</P>
<P>
 Bogguss and Atkins both had solo sets in addition to their duet performances. 
She was more impressive, though, working with Atkins, his subtle playing 
exquisitely complimenting her vocals. 
</P>
<P>
 An Atkins set is still a treat. Rather than looking for improvisational 
dazzle, you marvel at how such a low-key style can be so emotion-packed. Even 
at 70, Atkins still boasts a melodic touch that other guitarists would kill 
for. DENNIS HUNT

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; PROGFEST HIGHLIGHTS PROGRESSIVE ROCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The flash and bombast that was progressive rock is unlikely to enjoy the same 
rebirth this decade as other remnants of '70s pop. Even such art-rock champions 
as Yes and Genesis have long since moved on to the top-40 singles chart. 
</P>
<P>
 None of that kept the faithful from gathering on Saturday for the first of two 
days at the Variety Arts Center for Progfest '94. 
</P>
<P>
 Headlining on Saturday was the Swedish band Anglagarde, a six-person unit that 
mixed graceful acoustic passages with overblown jazz-rock crescendos. 
Unconcerned with the usual boundaries of song structure, Anglagarde wandered 
through long, aimless tunes that nonetheless included inventive performances by 
individual members. 
</P>
<P>
 Other bands were more specifically derivative of music from the genre's 
heyday, part Yes-spaciness, part Jethro Tull medieval. The Pennsylvania-based 
quintet Echolyn -- set to release their major-label debut on Epic next year -- 
performed music that was at times truly dramatic, and at other moments just 
virtuosity without end or purpose. A lesser version of the same was the band 
Kalaban from Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 These weren't old players who have been passed by time and fashion, but 
musicians in their 20s and 30s who perhaps first heard the originals back in 
junior high school, and for whom the names Cobain and Snoop may mean nothing at 
all. STEVE APPLEFORD

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; GUZMAN'S LATIN MIX A CROWD PLEASER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LOPETEGUI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let's put an end to all the talk about Gloria Trevi being Mexico's Madonna. 
The closest thing in Latin pop-rock to the sexy swagger and provocation of the 
Material Girl is Alejandra Guzman -- plus Guzman sings better than both of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 In Guzman's first Southern California appearance since a 2 1/2-year hiatus to 
give birth and care for her first child, the gifted singer and dancer was in 
top form before nearly 4,000 fans Saturday night at the outdoor Pico Rivera 
Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Supported by excellent production values and a tight eight-piece band, Guzman 
-- the daughter of '60s rock en espanol pioneer Enrique Guzman -- concentrated 
on standard blues-based, energetic pop songs and occasional ballads. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if hard-core rockers dismiss her as a creative lightweight, she is, in 
fact, a serious, diverse performer and one of the best female vocalists on the 
Latin pop scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Guzman kept the crowd waiting for more than an hour, she quickly made 
up for the lost time with crowd-pleasing antics -- especially her good-natured 
sexual aggression -- and catchy songs. 
</P>
<P>
 That material remains the biggest challenge for Guzman. She vowed recently to 
focus on more substantial songs, but has yet to do it. If she lives up to the 
promise, she will be among the most compelling figures in all of Latin pop. 
</P>
<P>
 The lengthy concert began with a short but winning set by local favorites 
Maria Fatal, followed by Spain's Seguridad Social (Social Security). The 
veteran group -- which offers a Latin fusion of rock, ska and reggae -- proved 
again it has some of the best musicians in rock en espanol. ENRIQUE LOPETEGUI

TV REVIEW; 'BURNING PASSION' BRINGS MITCHELL'S TARA TO REAL LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Margaret Mitchell, the author of "Gone With the Wind," was killed in a 
car crash in 1949 the impact was so shocking because Mitchell had become almost 
as celebrated as her legendary fictional heroine, Scarlett O'Hara. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in the biographical TV movie "A Burning Passion: The Margaret Mitchell 
Story," the sharply cast Shannen Doherty, in her first TV role since her 
tumultuous days on "Beverly Hills, 90210," dramatizes how indivisible Margaret 
Mitchell and Scarlett O'Hara really were. 
</P>
<P>
 Doherty's Margaret Mitchell, who grew up in a house like Tara, glamorously 
subverts traditions of the Old South while flirting shamelessly with young 
officers off to France. One fluttering doughboy, in a bit part, is played no 
less than by Clark Gable's son, John Clark Gable. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Larry Peerce and writer Robert Hamilton turn out a lush, Jazz 
Age-tinged historical drama redolent of fabled Peachtree Street lawn parties. 
During one soiree, the smoldering Doherty unfurls a risque Apache dance number 
before fainting Atlanta bluebloods. 
</P>
<P>
 Without underlining it, the movie dramatizes how the early feminist "Peggy" 
Mitchell later used herself as the model for the Scarlett O'Hara character. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally revealing is how Mitchell fashioned Clark Gable's Rhett Butler after 
her own first husband, the tempestuous Red Upshaw (the charismatic Dale 
Midkiff). 
</P>
<P>
 As for writing "Gone With the Wind" (her only novel, which Mitchell feared was 
a "onetime fluke"), the movie shows the influence of her grandmother (Rue 
McClanahan), who fills her young head with Civil War nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, fleeing her stormy marriage, Mitchell shatters the gender decorum of 
the day by taking a job as a newspaper reporter, where she literally learns to 
write ("Proper ladies do not work on newspapers," snorts her mother). 
</P>
<P>
 Do not miss the movie's opening, a 60-second black-and-white newsreel clip of 
Gable, Mitchell and some Civil War vets arriving for the 1939 Atlanta world 
premiere. 
</P>

24TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT; OLD-FASHIONED, HAND-SHAKING FINALE TO THE 
CAMPAIGNING; POLITICS: INCUMBENT ANTHONY BEILENSON AND GOP CHALLENGER RICHARD 
SYBERT EXPRESS GUARDED OPTIMISM AS THEY MEET ONE MORE TIME WITH SUPPORTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was relatively quiet, low-tech politics in the end. 
</P>
<P>
 After weeks of pumping tens of thousands of expensive, targeted mailers into 
district mailboxes, U.S. Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) met voters 
Sunday at the Calabasas home of a Republican supporter, while Richard Sybert, 
Beilenson's GOP challenger, thanked squads of his volunteers scattered 
throughout the huge 24th District. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men were guardedly optimistic about their prospects in Tuesday's 
election, one of the nation's most hotly contested congressional races. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear that people are supposed to be nursing a grudge against their 
representatives and are ready to throw them out, but I don't sense it," 
Beilenson told a reporter just before his wife, Dolores, gave him a hug and 
sent him out to speak to 40 voters at the home of Steven and Julie Fuld. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be close, but I'm confident," said Sybert as he visited 
mortgage broker Ray Fausner's office in Woodland Hills, where 10 volunteers had 
gathered to phone previously identified pro-Sybert Republicans and remind them 
to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, both men have spent $1 million, with Sybert outspending Beilenson by 
more than a 2-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, a former top aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, has put together a formidable 
challenge that has benefited from his own wealth (he has put more than $400,000 
of his own money into the race) and from the help of a string of GOP political 
heavyweights -- from Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kansas) to Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Georgia) 
-- who have trooped through the district to raise funds for the candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Sybert's day began with worship services at Our Redeemer Lutheran 
Church in Thousand Oaks. But by early afternoon, campaign obligations had sent 
the 42-year-old challenger and his wife, Greta, to locations in Woodland Hills, 
Agoura Hills and Newbury Park, where volunteers were operating phone banks. 
About 75 of them were at the three locations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most striking thing about the volunteers is that they want to see change, 
they think the country is going in the wrong direction," Sybert said. "People 
feel very uneasy . . . about the loss of values, the sense of disorder." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he supports modest gun control laws and does not believe the 
government should interfere with a woman's right to choose abortion (nor 
subsidize her abortion if she can't afford it), Sybert is hawkish on budget, 
defense and illegal-immigration issues and supports numerous congressional 
reforms, including term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Sybert's volunteers Sunday were Tarzana tennis instructor Joane Stewart 
and Ray Fausner, owner of Real Estate Access Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hadn't been involved much in politics until I started getting disgusted 
with what was happening to the state that I moved to 29 years ago," Stewart 
said. "For example, I hate to see a ballot written in five languages. When my 
great-grandparents came to this country they had to learn to speak English." 
</P>
<P>
 Fausner shared these frustrations and had some vitriol to add to the mix. 
"We're living in what's basically a communist society," he fumed. "With all 
these taxes under Clinton, we are becoming more and more the slaves of 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the light agenda, Sybert, working in his shirt sleeves, did manage 
some small indignation over a slate mailer, with a photo of former Sen. Barry 
Goldwater on the cover, from a group called Citizens for Republican Values. The 
mailer urged the election of the entire Republican ticket in statewide races, 
but it also endorsed Beilenson. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a little disingenuous, I'd say," Sybert said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Never heard of it," said Beilenson campaign consultant Craig Miller later. 
The piece was traced to political consultant Fred Huebscher, who produces three 
slates, including those under the name of the California Democratic Alliance 
and the Independent Voters League. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the 62-year-old Beilenson also had a light day of campaigning 
Sunday that included a two-hour "coffee" at the home of the Fulds in Parkway 
Calabasas Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Fuld, an insurance executive, said that while he is a Republican and a 
member of the National Rifle Assn., "I separate Tony Beilenson from the rest of 
the politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 He first met Beilenson three years ago when he was in Washington on a lobbying 
trip for the Assn. for Advanced Life Underwriting, Fuld said. "I found he cared 
about the issues, was willing to learn, but not willing to take our money," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 During 40 minutes of discursive remarks, Beilenson decried sensational 
journalism and talk-radio shows, contending they have debased political 
discourse and made it harder for the nation to be governed. He alternately 
praised President Clinton for addressing domestic reforms that had long been 
neglected in the Reagan-Bush era and criticized him for not seeking to work 
more closely with Republicans on bipartisan solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 As he has done countless times before, Beilenson also ticked off what he 
called a list of accomplishments of the recent Congress, including passage of a 
crime bill that is to put 100,000 additional police on the nation's streets and 
provide federal aid to reimburse California for the cost of imprisoning illegal 
immigrants. He also cited the passage of the Clinton deficit-reduction plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout, the incumbent soft-pedaled his own candidacy. He warned of the 
dangers of gridlock if Republican congressional victories are significant, 
touted the need to have experienced legislators like himself when so many 
veteran legislators are retiring and boasted that he does not take political 
action committee money. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson ended his talk by saying he and his wife, Dolores, hoped the 
election would prove that a "good guy" like himself can still be elected.

PROPOSITION 188; SMOKING INITIATIVE COMES UNDER FIRE FROM STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DOYLE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maya Adrabi is too young to visit a voting booth. But that didn't stop the 
16-year-old high school student from rallying Sunday against a ballot 
initiative that she believes could "murder" her generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I refuse to see my friends be poisoned," Maya said of Proposition 188, an 
initiative on Tuesday's ballot that would permit smoking in restaurants and 
most other buildings in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Maya joined nearly 50 protesters -- mostly members of Kids Against Public 
Smoking, or KAPS -- who gathered in front of the Van Nuys American Cancer 
Society building to oppose the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing shirts that read "2nd Hand Smoke Causes Disease, Disability, Death," 
the protesters urged adults to vote the measure down Tuesday, contending it 
would expose millions of people to secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "This proposition is nothing but a pack of lies," said Jean Sun, a Van Nuys 
High School student. "It's full of deceit." 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by tobacco giant Philip Morris USA, Proposition 188 would return to 
restaurants and other businesses the right to permit smoking. Businesses that 
allow smoking would be required to provide ventilation, although the standards 
outlined in the proposition are not designed to reduce health risks from 
tobacco smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative would erase local smoking bans from Los Angeles to Redding, and 
prevent cities from regulating tobacco use in the future. The initiative also 
collides head-on with a bill passed by the state Legislature that would ban 
smoking in most enclosed workplaces -- from restaurants and offices to 
factories and most warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Philip Morris doesn't give a damn about your health, their only concern is to 
make a profit," said Alan Zover, moderator of the protest and founder of KAPS. 
</P>
<P>
 Zover started the organization in 1987 after reading then-Surgeon General C. 
Everett Koop's first report on the dangers of secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughters were 8 and 10 years old at the time," said Zover, who lives in 
Agoura Hills. "I felt it was a profound injustice that innocent children should 
be exposed to cancer-causing agents that are known to be in secondhand smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 So Zover began giving speeches about the dangers of secondhand smoke to San 
Fernando Valley high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he hoped his efforts would persuade young people to support smoking 
bans and to take their views to local elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believed the voice of innocents would have a profound effect," Zover said 
"The kids would go to the city council and say, 'If we can't vote, who's going 
to protect us?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood), author of the statewide smoking 
prohibition law, also attended Sunday's rally. He alleged that Proposition 188 
is "the biggest fraud" in the history of California politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we going to let the tobacco company buy this election?" Friedman asked.  
</P>
<P>
 Drafters of Proposition 188 argue that the initiative would protect 
nonsmokers, while ensuring that the government does not interfere with personal 
liberties. And some opponents of smoking bans argue that these types of 
ordinances could hurt businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 But 17-year-old Elisa Ung said she believes the tobacco company's only concern 
is to protect its profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're saying it's a reasonable solution to a tough problem," she said. 
"It's only reasonable if you are a tobacco company protecting your profits." 
She added that the initiative is unfair to nonsmoking Californians who would be 
exposed to secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "The authors want us to believe it is protecting people. There is nothing 
further from the truth," said Harriet Sculley, president of the 31st District 
Parent Teacher Student Assn. "The tobacco industry's lies show how desperate 
they have become. They are counting on the public to be too ignorant to 
understand what this proposition really means."

THE DISASSEMBLY LINE; AUTO PARTS: PERSISTENT PATRONS FIND GEMS AMONG THE JUNK 
AT A SUN VALLEY WRECKING YARD. THE LOT HAS 3,000 BEAT-UP VEHICLES, ARCHES FROM 
A CARWASH AND REMNANTS OF AN ARMY TANK.

<P>
 Most people would look out upon the 26-acre, U-Pick Parts junkyard and just 
see rows of beat-up, shelled-out, mangled cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Garcia looks out among the wrecks and sees possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what I build cars from," said Garcia, an Arleta resident who restores 
old cars as a hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 He had just found the very items he was looking for -- three bulbs for the 
exterior lights on his cherished 1965 Buick Riviera. The total cost for these 
treasures: $2. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I can rebuild a whole car by just coming here," he said, delighted 
with his find. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, 32, a regular at the Sun Valley junkyard since it opened nine years 
ago, knows that shopping at the 26-acre lot is a hit-and-miss proposition. 
There are no inventory lists, so you can spend hours searching through the 
3,000 cars, motorcycles, trucks and other vehicles without finding anything on 
your wanted list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knows you take your chances when you come here," Garcia said.  
</P>
<P>
 "If I don't find it here, I have to buy it someplace else and probably pay an 
arm and a leg for it." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the trade-off. You can waste a lot of time at this self-service lot, 
but it's worth it if you find what you need. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The customers know there is no guarantee on anything. They pay cash and they 
do the work themselves," said Andrew Adlin, controller for Aadlin Bros., the 
firm that owns the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Adlin is a member of the family that owns the junkyard. The extra "A" was 
added to the business name, he said, so that it would get higher placement in 
telephone listings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is almost like a supermarket," he said. "You go in and find everything you 
need yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 And like a supermarket, Adlin said the junkyard is restocked every day. The 
cars, at a rate of about 50 a day, commonly come from police auctions, tow 
companies, insurance companies and the back yards of people who want to make a 
few bucks off a car they had sitting around. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs in English and Spanish encourage customers to bring their own tools and 
wear sturdy footgear. Patrons pay $1 to get in and then pay for parts -- 
ranging from $100 for a complete engine down to $1 paid by Garcia for the 
bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Junkyard workers spray-paint tools or old parts brought in by customers so 
that they can be identified. They also stamp customers' hands for in-and-out 
privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to road vehicles, the junkyard is the home of huge yellow arches 
that once belonged to a carwash on the corner of Laurel Canyon and Ventura 
boulevards, a condemned Santa Fe train car and the remnants of an old Army tank 
with the turret still intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the lot is 7-Up, a Brahman bull that lives in a pen in the center of 
the junkyard with half a dozen chickens.  
</P>
<P>
 Nino Gasparini, 33, was at U-Pick Parts on Thursday afternoon looking for a 
right front fender and a hood that would fit his 1974 Chevy Malibu. He had 
wrecked the car that morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "My car was totaled and the insurance company won't pay for it because it is 
such an old car," he said, looking through a white Malibu on the lot for parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Gasparini acknowledged that most owners of a wrecked car would just write it 
off. "But here I can fix it and not have to pay more than the car is worth," he 
said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 With him was a trusted, if not enthusiastic, friend. "I don't like to get 
dirty," said John D. Kambaneli, 27, of Glendale, holding a fender gingerly. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Teresa Villalobos, 35, of Pacoima came to the junkyard with her husband, who 
was searching for parts for his Chevy truck. Wearing white shoes, she 
delicately stepped over grease puddles and glass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like coming here, but you have to if you want parts for a good 
price," Villalobos said in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the money we save, maybe he will get me a new pair of shoes."

43RD DISTRICT; CANDIDATES 'CONFIDENT' AS JUDGMENT DAY NEARS; ASSEMBLY RACE THAT 
INCLUDED CLASH OVER TEACHING OF CREATIONISM IN SCHOOLS WINDS DOWN. FAMILY 
VALUES EMPHASIZED IN SUNDAY'S FINAL PUSH.

<P>
 And on the seventh day, Adam and Eve worked the phones. 
</P>
<P>
 In a union hall in Burbank, challenger Adam Schiff and his fiancee, Eve 
Sanderson, spent Sunday dialing up Democratic voters in the Burbank-Glendale 
legislative race that has evolved into the region's most spirited contest for 
Assembly, the 43rd District. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning was the campaign, and it was fought over such issues as the 
teaching of creationism in the public schools. On Sunday, as it drew to an end, 
both Schiff and the conservative Republican incumbent, James Rogan, saw that it 
was good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am feeling very confident," Schiff said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am feeling very confident and I feel comfortable, and that's almost more 
important than confident," Rogan said Sunday afternoon while walking precincts 
in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined, the two contenders have pumped more than $650,000 into the race as 
Democrats, sensing opportunity, launched an ambitious challenge in what has 
long been considered a Republican stronghold. The 43rd District includes not 
only Burbank and Glendale but Los Feliz, Silverlake and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan and campaign staffers said Sunday that a poll taken about 10 days ago 
shows him winning handily. Countered Schiff: "If you believe a candidate's 
poll, I have a used car I want to sell you." 
</P>
<P>
 The election two years ago gave Democrats reason for hope in the 43rd; Bill 
Clinton, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer fared well. Then last April, Pat 
Nolan, the veteran Republican who had represented the district for years, was 
sent to prison as part of a federal undercover probe of corruption at the state 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Rogan, a former judge, easily won a special election to pick a 
replacement for the final months of Nolan's term. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking a full two-year term, Rogan, 37, focused this fall on three issues -- 
crime, taxes and illegal immigration. He also stressed his experience as a 
prosecutor and judge. "I think my record commends me for reelection," he said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff, 34, a former federal prosecutor, announced his support for a "three 
strikes" law for violent criminals. He said he backs measures to ban assault 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 He also focused on Rogan's record, portraying the onetime Democrat as the 
captive of the GOP's radical Christian right wing. "I think it says something 
about him as a person that he would have such wild swings in conviction," 
Schiff said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a debate last month, the blunt-talking Rogan acknowledged that he favored 
the idea of public school instructors teaching the theory of Biblical 
creationism -- along with evolutionary theory -- as one explanation of the 
origins of mankind. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had thought originally that the six to eight debates we'd have during the 
campaign would be like the Lincoln-Douglas debates," Schiff said Sunday. "It 
turned out to be more like the Clarence Darrow-William Jennings Bryan debates," 
a reference to the Scopes monkey trial in Tennessee in the 1920s over the 
teaching of evolution in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a man of conviction," Rogan said Sunday. "I've never hemmed nor hawed 
about where I stand." 
</P>
<P>
 But he added: "This is not a campaign about religion or abortion or 
creationism." Schiff, he said, has "been very adept at diverting attention from 
the things we ought to be talking about -- the economy, immigration, taxes and 
the schools." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, both campaigns were dominated Sunday by an appeal to family values -- 
as relatives for both candidates pitched in to pitch for votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking precincts in Glendale with Rogan was his wife, Christine, as well as a 
nephew, Nathan Apffel, 10, and a niece, Virginia Apffel, 11. "I'm very proud of 
my uncle Jim," Nathan Apffel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Working alongside Schiff's fiancee at the union hall in Burbank were his 
parents, who had flown in from Texas, and his brother and sister-in-law, down 
from San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the callers tell me, not every son is a good son," said the candidate's 
mother, Sherry Schiff. "But he's a good son."

PROPOSITION 187; LEADERS URGE PROTESTERS TO KEEP UP THE FIGHT; SAN FERNANDO: 
ABOUT 65 GATHER AT A CATHOLIC CHURCH TO VOICE OPPOSITION TO THE HOTLY DEBATED 
IMMIGRATION MEASURE.

<P>
 In a last round of organizing voters against Proposition 187, community 
leaders called on dwindling crowds of protesters Sunday to keep up the fight 
against the controversial measure in the final hours before Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 A meeting at St. Ferdinand's Catholic Church in San Fernando drew just 65 
protesters, but most said they gave up their Sunday dinners to show their 
determination to defeat the measure that would deny some of their neighbors the 
right to education and health care. 
</P>
<P>
 "This measure will cause a lot of pain and our children will suffer," said 
Consuelo Valdez, 45. "These people are the ones who will be denied." 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Ledezema, 17, of Pacoima said she came with her mother to the Sunday 
meeting after being involved in student protests last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't just walk out of school, we did it for a reason, and that is why 
I'm here tonight," said Elizabeth, a senior at San Fernando High School. "I 
know a lot of people who will be affected." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the group VOICE, or Valley Organized in Community Efforts, and 
other community leaders, including Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon, 
assembled in the parish hall to join the protesters as a mariachi band played 
in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have a few days left and every vote counts," Father David Ullrich, 
pastor of St. Ferdinand's, told the crowd in English and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "People of many different religions have stated and restated their opposition 
to this measure on moral grounds," he said, as protesters waved signs from the 
audience that read, "No on Prop. 187. It is immoral and inhumane." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier on Sunday, about 45 people gathered at a protest at Northridge Park 
with signs and flags against the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyrone Harris of Reseda wore a paper bag over his head. On the back he had 
scrawled: "You should be ashamed of yourself California."

2 SHOT IN UNRELATED DRIVE-BY INCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles police on Sunday were investigating separate drive-by shootings 
that wounded two men in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first incident, a 26-year-old North Hollywood man was shot once in the 
chest outside a party in the 6800 block of Fulton Avenue, Sgt. Joseph Brazas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics responded to the scene at 10:21 p.m. Saturday and took Juan 
Martinez to Northridge Hospital Medical Center, said Brian Humphrey of the Los 
Angeles Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe the gunmen were gang members who asked Martinez where he 
was from before they began shooting, said Detective John Edwards. Edwards, who 
interviewed Martinez on Sunday, said the man was expected to recover from the 
wound. 
</P>
<P>
 About two hours after the first shooting, a security guard was shot five times 
in the right shin after two men he had told earlier to leave a bar for 
intoxication returned with a gun, Lt. Nick Zingo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The guard told police that the gunmen climbed into a pickup truck, but 
returned several minutes later and opened fire on him as he stood in the 
parking lot of the El Merengue Bar in the 12100 block of Vanowen Street, Zingo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The guard, whose name was not released, was in stable condition Sunday at the 
Medical Center of North Hollywood, Zingo said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one had been arrested Sunday in connection with either shooting, which 
police said were not related.

PASSERBY KILLS WOMAN'S ASSAILANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Palmdale man who was pistol-whipping his girlfriend outside an apartment 
building was shot and killed by an unidentified passerby who came to the 
woman's aid, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Kenneth Wilson, 20, of Palmdale was pronounced dead at an Antelope 
Valley hospital after the incident, which occurred in the 3800 block of 10th 
Street about 11:40 p.m. Saturday, Sheriff's Deputy Brian Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead man's girlfriend, Dolly Garland-Smith, 24, also of Palmdale was 
treated for her injuries at a local hospital and released, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to investigators, Wilson was in the process of pistol-whipping his 
girlfriend when an unidentified person came to her aid and shot Wilson in her 
defense," Jones said. "Sheriff's detectives say the shooting is apparently 
justifiable and would like to classify it as an excusable homicide." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said investigators need the public's help in locating the man, whom they 
called a "good Samaritan."

<P>
 A 38-year-old Lancaster woman was arrested on suspicion of setting fire to her 
daughter's apartment after sheriff's deputies smelled a flammable liquid when 
they questioned the woman, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tania Hurd, 18, told deputies that she saw her mother, Cheryl Hurd-Preyer, 
running from the apartment in the 4800 block of West Avenue L-8 just after she 
noticed that a windowsill was on fire, said Deputy Rich Erickson of the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurd and her mother had been involved in an ongoing dispute, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurd's month-old infant was sleeping in another bedroom on the other side of 
the apartment house when the fire began about 7 p.m. Saturday, he said. Hurd's 
boyfriend, who was not identified, also was inside the apartment when flames 
broke out, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurd-Preyer of Lancaster was questioned at her home and arrested after 
deputies detected the odor of a flammable liquid when they spoke with the 
woman, Erickson said. She was booked on suspicion of residential arson at the 
Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station and is being held in lieu of $250,000 bail, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the fire, which caused only minor damage. CHIP JOHNSON

ANTELOPE VALLEY; COUNCIL PAIR SCOLD MAYOR OVER LATE AGENDA ITEM; GOVERNMENT: 
FRANK ROBERTS IS ACCUSED OF ADDING CITY MANAGER'S CONTRACT ISSUE IN HOPES IT 
PASSES WITHOUT DISCUSSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two Lancaster officials have accused the city's mayor of trying to sneak an 
item onto tonight's City Council agenda that would change the contract of City 
Manager Jim Gilley. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Mike Singer and Deborah Shelton -- both of whom were first 
elected in April -- said they believe Mayor Frank Roberts slipped the item onto 
the consent calendar hoping it would pass without discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was given an addendum to our normal agenda on Friday afternoon, late," 
Singer said. "I didn't read it at the time; it was just stuck in my file. I had 
no idea this was coming down." 
</P>
<P>
 Consent calendars are part of the agenda often passed without council comment 
or discussion. Any item on the consent calendar, however, can be removed during 
the meeting for discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts said he added the item after the city attorney told him that Gilley's 
present contract was illegal under new laws. So, Roberts said, he placed the 
matter on the consent calendar because he is required under the state's 
open-meeting laws to discuss staff salary changes in public. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, this thing isn't cast in bronze," Roberts said. "We regularly pull 10 or 
15 items off the consent calendar for discussion and this is no different. It 
will be discussed and cussed, I'm sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Singer and Shelton said they were angry because they believe they have no part 
in deciding whether to retain Gilley, whose current contract with the city runs 
through August, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really disturbed when I opened my packet and found that item added," 
Shelton said. "I saw red, like I did when I was a citizen, and they used to 
always try and hide things when they added them onto the consent calendar. When 
I saw this, I thought, 'Oh, my God, it's happening again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts said Gilley's performance is reviewed annually and a vote is held each 
year to determine whether he will stay another year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the contract change, Gilley could be terminated at any time with 18 
months pay if four or five council members were to vote against him, Roberts 
said. If just three members vote for his ouster, Gilley would be retained as a 
consultant for an additional 30 months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The current contract calls for Gilley's termination with six months pay if 
four council members vote to terminate him, Roberts said. If just three council 
members vote to remove Gilley, his contract would be bought out with no 
provision for additional service, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council member George Runner disputed the claim that the last-minute item is a 
controversial issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, we are dealing with a normal review of contract, and it's not a 
substantial issue," he said.

JACK SMITH: EVEN THOSE WHO NEVER KNEW HIM FEEL THE LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many readers have written to express their sorrow over the death of my Baja 
friend and landlord, Romulo Gomez. Though most of them knew him only through my 
columns about building our house in Baja, they thought of him as a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very sorry to read that Mr. Gomez has passed away," writes Dorothy 
Bolton of Huntington Beach. "I have enjoyed your adventures with him over the 
years. . . . Wouldn't it be wonderful if more of us had Mr. Gomez's attitude 
toward life?" 
</P>
<P>
 Most said they had enjoyed my book about that adventure, "God and Mr. Gomez," 
and wondered if they could get another copy. (I'm sorry -- I have only a 
handful left. Maybe I can get some publisher to print a new edition.) 
</P>
<P>
 "This time," writes Ronnie McGee of Hemet, "God may have gotten more than He 
bargained for as I'm sure Mr. Gomez will organize Him." 
</P>
<P>
 From Michele Yepiz of Lemon Grove: "If there is a God, he is fortunate He has 
met Mr. Gomez. You and your Baja neighbors were lucky people to know this 
good-natured man." 
</P>
<P>
 "How touched your longtime readers must feel, having read your column today," 
writes Whit Brayton Jr. of Hemet. However, he notes that in saying I had used 
God's name in the title of my book I erred. "God's title is God," he says. "His 
name is Jehovah." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, darn. 
</P>
<P>
 Eve Langstaff of Hemet writes, "What a bummer it was to read your column about 
the demise of Mr. Gomez. Shall we hope he's aiding and abetting St. Peter in 
his work, perhaps an addition to the heavenly estates?" 
</P>
<P>
 (If so, I hope St. Peter is a patient saint.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I have loved you and Mr. Gomez for many years," writes Kay Diebel of Newport 
Beach. 'I am sorry to read of his death. . . . Thinking of him, and the book, 
still brings back smiles of pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
 Several readers write of driving down to Baja to find our house, and others of 
meeting Mr. Gomez himself.  
</P>
<P>
 "You have enriched our lives in many ways," write Hugh and Anne Salisbury of 
Midway City. "But the association with Mr. Gomez's family and the building of 
your Baja home -- such pleasure we had watching that part of your life unfold." 
</P>
<P>
 "My heart goes out to him and his family," writes Beverly Spiker of Los 
Angeles. "I did not know Mr. Gomez but I felt like I did through you. I'm sure 
he is with God now and doing only good things up there." 
</P>
<P>
 I feel obliged to print in full a letter, addressed to me and my wife, from my 
friend and mentor, Rabbi Alfred Wolf: 
</P>
<P>
 "Miriam and I wish to extend our heartfelt sympathy to both of you on the 
passing of your friend, Mr. Gomez. Thanks to you, he was our friend, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your column this morning, dear Jack, brought back a whole treasure of 
cherished memories. You gave us quite a treat by letting us share your trips to 
Baja. Yes, we've also been to Baja, Ensenada, Cabo San Lucas . . . by ship. We 
didn't really experience the place except through your writing, Jack. How else 
could we match your rocky rides over rutted roads, the risky hikes to your 
cabin, the fascinating negotiations with Mr. Gomez, the quiet seclusion of your 
retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now all that wonderful material is locked up exclusively in your memory. 
Please don't wait for another chance event to unlock your treasure chest. Every 
once-in-a-Monday, open it up and share." 
</P>
<P>
 "I raise a glass to Mr. Gomez and to you," writes Mildred M. Bridgeford of 
Hemet. "The patience you exhibited, the gentle spirit of Mr. Gomez and the 
development of a strong and understanding friendship brought much pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
 "I reread my copy of 'God and Mr. Gomez' this afternoon," writes Alice Stearns 
of Woodland Hills. "Laughed a lot, and cried too. Certainly a tequila to a very 
wise and kind soul . . . and I'm sure it will ever be . . . God and Mr. Gomez." 
</P>
<P>
 In my column on Mr. Gomez's death, I said that some readers had mistakenly 
thought he was something of a con man. Not true. He was honorable to the last. 
It was only that sometimes his vision of propriety was different from mine. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, when I decided to sell the house (because the road was getting 
too long), Mr. Gomez was my agent. After all, he was the real owner of the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 I gave him a figure that I hoped to get for it. Later, in talking to the 
buyers, I found that he had charged them somewhat more. 
</P>
<P>
 When I remonstrated with him about this he said, "Well, Jack, I had to make a 
commission ." 
</P>
<P>
 Can't argue with that, Mr. Gomez.

 Fleiss flak: Jay Leno, on Heidi's trial, next door to O.J.'s: "Judge Ito was

 Comedy writer Bob Mills says Heidi "had court watchers on the edge of their

shuttle: "Scientists are miffed. He ruined one of their biology experiments by 
eating all the snails, and he keeps demanding the wine list and hollering: 
'Stewardess!' "

 Mills, on the Senate's advice to tighten security within the CIA: "Any agent 
found to have the names of foreign spies on their MCI Friends and Family list 
should be fired immediately."

 Auditors say New Mexico's labor department grossly misspent $100,000 for a 
computer payroll system, and $90,000 to train workers on a system most 
currently don't use. "The Pentagon has expressed envy," says comic Argus 
Hamilton, "and is sending a task force to absorb the wisdom." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, on last week's four New York lottery winners, who each got $18 
million: "They were all so disappointed; it's not nearly enough to move to 
California and run for U.S. Senate." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Tony Peyser, on two Boston teen-age sisters arraigned on charges 
of stealing their granny's life savings to pay for a Disney World trip: "Asked 
what they're going to do now, the girls said, 'We're going to jail!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Clay Heery, on the North Carolina lawyer on trial for billing 
clients for 24-hour days and seven-day work weeks: "The prosecutor charges 
fraud, but the state bar spokesman responded by saying, 'What? You mean there 
are only 24 hours in a day?' "

 Ray, on Dan Quayle stumping for the Republican candidates: "He says it's not

 Arriving late for the movies with his 5-year-old daughter, Steve Mitchell of 
Costa Mesa grabbed some refreshments and headed to the theater. Pushing through 
the curtain, they joined other late-comers waiting in darkness for enough light 
to find seats. Hearing a whimper from his daughter, Mitchell said, "Lauren, 
grab onto my leg and hold on." 
</P>
<P>
 After a moment's silence, a nearby voice said: "That's not your father's leg."

COMMITMENTS: CLASSIFIED MATERIAL; SELLING YOURSELF IN THE PERSONALS IS A TOUGH 
PITCH. BUT SHARON HUFF CAN HELP. HER ADVICE? SOME CREATIVE HONESTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN ALCORN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 She'd tell you if your new haircut made you look fat. She'd tell you if your 
tie was crooked, even if you were a total stranger. If you seemed nice enough, 
she'd probably even straighten it for you. But what Sharon Huff really wants to 
straighten out is your love life, and she guarantees she can do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Huff, 47, is the author and publisher of "20 Tips to a Dynamite Personal Ad," 
a no-nonsense guide to finding the perfect mate through the personal classified 
ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps you've scoffed at all those outdoorsy, financially secure SWMs and 
DBFs casting about for their athletic, emotionally available counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Huff used to scoff, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, last year, her 10-year marriage broke up. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden I was on my own again and I had no idea how to meet people," 
said Huff, a Miami artist and graphic designer.  
</P>
<P>
 Huff soon discovered that her hometown newspaper had page after page of 
classified ads from potential companions. 
</P>
<P>
 There was only one problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were all so pathetic," she said. "It was so sad. This one guy started 
his ad out with the headline 'Herpes Simplex.' Now, who in the world would 
start their ad with what has to be their least attractive feature?" 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was this gem: "Male, white, 60 years old, 5' 7", 180 lbs., has 
vasectomy, would like to meet lady with same." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought to myself, 'These people do not know how to advertise,' " Huff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Huff would write to the poor slobs she felt sorriest for and offer 
her advice on how to pep up their presentation. No one wrote back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I hurt their feelings," she said. Huff kept on critiquing the ads, 
quietly, to herself, and "little by little, all these tips came together, and I 
just sat down one day and wrote them down," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus was born "20 Tips," a 10-page pamphlet you could easily read while 
watching "The Love Connection." 
</P>
<P>
 Tip No. 1: Be truthful. 
</P>
<P>
 Hmmm. Trouble already. Honesty may be the best policy if you're, say, in the 
cast of "Baywatch," but what about the rest of us -- the debt-ridden, 
dumpling-shaped, ill-tempered, middle-aged masses? 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Tips No. 2 through 20 seem specially designed to spin-control Tip 
No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Huff, who describes herself in personal-ad lingo as "tall, bright, blond, 
fabulous 40s, sparkly, kind and easy to talk to," says you must be honest, "but 
in your honesty, don't have a false modesty." After all, this is an 
advertisement, not a tax return. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of "middle-aged," Huff recommends rounding off to the nearest decade 
("30-plus"). For "dumpling-shaped," she offers a whole smorgasbord of 
alternatives ("stately," "large and lovable"). 
</P>
<P>
 She even puts a spin on poverty ("enjoys life's simple pleasures"), divorce 
("single") and bereavement (" 'Widower, single dad' will pull a lot of maternal 
heartstrings," she writes). 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the tips, you get admonishments ("Please don't say 'no fats, no 
overweights,' that's hurtful to some readers"), pep talks ("Dare to be 
outrageous. Have fun!") and needlings ("Guys, why is it so many of you request 
someone young enough to be your daughter?"). 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, Huff stresses the importance of conveying a sense of your 
personality. In the back of the booklet is an alphabetized checklist of 196 
words -- from adaptable to zesty -- to help you out in this department, if 
articulate isn't one of your characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you create a well-written ad, you're creating a hopeful fantasy in the 
mind of your readers," Huff said. "With a few well-chosen words, they can 
already picture themselves riding bicycles under the oak trees." 
</P>
<P>
 When you're looking for love, it's just as important to be able to read the 
personal ads as write one, Huff said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to be able to read between the lines," she said. "A guy that will 
start his ad out with 'Herpes Simplex' -- at least you know he's very honest 
and very courageous, though maybe not the brightest. At least you know that if 
he's got something bad to say, he'll say it right out." 
</P>
<P>
 Huff sells her booklet for $6.97. And she promises that if you don't "get a 
date, make a new friend or start a relationship" within six months of following 
her advice, she'll send your money back. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, no one has asked for a refund. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had one sweet old lady write to me from Kansas City and tell me that I 
should put the price on the cover of the booklet," Huff said. "She wrote to me 
on the back of the refund certificate, so I guess it was working out." 
</P>
<P>
 It's working out for Charlie Willis, too. Willis separated from his wife on 
Valentine's Day this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Several months went by before the 47-year-old ex-Marine could even think about 
dating again. When he came across Huff's book, he decided to give the personal 
ads a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm no Fabio or nothing. The best I can say for myself is, I've got most of 
my hair," he said. "I haven't had a date in 14 years, but now I've got all 
these chicks calling me up." 
</P>
<P>
 Willis never wrote an ad for himself, but used Huff's tips about reading 
between the lines to answer ads placed by single women. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, he's going on his first date with Marci ("into arts, fishing, lace and 
jeans, roses and wrestling"), and he's also going to go out with Carolyn 
("blond hair, green-eyed, tan country girl"). Rosie, the red-headed 
hairdresser, will have to wait her turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the way to go," Willis said with obvious delight. "My phone never 
stops ringing." 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere between all those calls, Willis managed to call Huff and thank her 
for helping him turn around his social life. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said I was pretty smart for a girl," she recalled with a laugh. "But he 
said it in a really cute way; it wasn't offensive at all. Then he asked if I 
was single." 
</P>
<P>
 She isn't -- she and her husband, Bob, reunited in January, though Huff hasn't 
lost her obsession with the personals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he got worried because there he is sitting next to me reading the 
paper and the personal ads are the first thing I grab," Huff said. 
</P>

FIRST PERSON: COMMITMENTS; IS 'TYPICAL' GAY LIFESTYLE LIBERATING OR CONFINING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK DeCARO, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's always a bit disconcerting when you realize that if someone looked up the 
word gay in the dictionary, he or she might find your picture there with the 
words "archetypal homosexual" written underneath it. It could happen. 
</P>
<P>
 I say this because the other day I was leafing through a copy of "The 
Unofficial Gay Manual," a new tongue-in-cheek guide to gay life written by 
Kevin Dilallo and Jack Krumholtz, and came across a list of 18 films every gay 
man should see. 
</P>
<P>
 I've seen 16 of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I turned to a list of 16 albums every gay man should own. Ten of them are 
in my apartment, most on CD because the vinyl copies wore out. If I possessed 
the Judy/Liza genes -- which shockingly, I don't -- I'd have scored even higher 
. . . and been more depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes you rethink your alleged uniqueness. You know, you want to believe 
you're so original, such the outsider, and then you realize you're not. You are 
the one they write these books for -- a guy with an active gym membership, a 
Barneys charge card, a subscription to Martha Stewart Living and a video copy 
of "Stryker Force" in a box under the bed. 
</P>
<P>
 You're a little quirkier than most, perhaps, but really you're just like every 
other guppie in the universe. You laugh, you cry, you'd sell your mother for a 
chance at Dolph Lundgren.  
</P>
<P>
 Even if you're not stereo-, you're typical. 
</P>
<P>
 I often wonder what gay men who don't fit the mold must feel like. I've known 
guys who told people they were gay and no one believed them -- you know, the 
old but-you-don't-have-a- mustache-how-could-you-be? thing. But certainly that 
was never my experience or that of my very openly gay friends. Everyone 
believed us. It must be different for guys who are gay but not gay as we know 
it. They're out there on their own, not safely ghettoized in West Hollywood or 
the equivalent. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Mould is one of these guys, I suspect. In a Rolling Stone interview, the 
openly gay front man for the punk band Sugar (and multichinned former leader of 
Husker Du) said: "I've never understood the gay lifestyle. It's not part of 
what makes me a person. If I decide to have sex with a man, I'm not sure that 
absolutely means that I have to be a gay role model . . . My sexuality is no 
secret. It really never has been. But (my) songs are for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 To be honest, I don't really know Mould's songs. But I do wonder about Mould's 
life. I want to know if it is better because he doesn't identify with the 
prescribed "gay lifestyle" -- the lifestyle that fuels gay-themed gift 
catalogues and episodes of "Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder if feeling separate from the gay community frees him up from the 
expectations of what gay life is supposed to be and removes the limits placed 
on us by society and by ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Is he free to create any kind of life he wants? I ask myself, do he and other 
outsiders who are "in the life" lead richer lives by blending into the fabric 
of society as a whole, or are they missing a lot by not immersing themselves in 
gay culture? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure. On the one hand, Mould's blase attitude about his sexuality is 
admirable. Because, really, the gender of your mate is no big deal, as long as 
you're nice to each other and to your mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, every person who decides that being out of the closet isn't 
enough and joins the fight for equal rights for gays and lesbians helps advance 
the cause for us all. 
</P>
<P>
 Mould says he won't be a gay flag-waver. That's his prerogative. I just hope 
he realizes the important challenge facing every openly gay person -- changing 
people's minds about what it means to be gay. I'd like to believe that is what 
he has in mind by being so openly himself. In that case, he may have helped to 
change mine.

COMMITMENTS: TWO'S COMPANY, FRIENDS A CROWD? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA HENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles family therapist Marcia Lasswell knows how to spot married couples 
who are so closely bonded they might as well be attached with super glue. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can spot them at parties," says Lasswell, president-elect of the American 
Assn. for Marriage and Family Therapy. "When a hostess wants to seat them 
separately, they want to sit together. And the women won't dance with anyone 
but their husbands. They're almost attached at the hip." 
</P>
<P>
 Other closely bonded couples go as far as dressing alike, even sewing matching 
husband-and-wife outfits. 
</P>
<P>
 While these examples may be extreme, many couples are so content with their 
relationship that they do not seek friendships outside of their marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have everything I could want in one person," says Loretta Pafford, 45, a 
Santa Clarita office assistant. "I was looking for a good buddy and a friend 
and the person who could be everything in my life. And I've got him. He's like 
a gift." 
</P>
<P>
 Pafford is so close to Roger, her husband of 17 years, that she says she 
"feels like his heartbeat." 
</P>
<P>
 Mabel De Salvo, 35, a post office clerk who lives in Covina, happily admits 
she feels the need to invite guests to her home no more than once or twice a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband of seven years, Russell, is her "best friend, buddy, playmate and 
enemy when we fight," she says. They have two children. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Marilyn Ruman, a psychologist who works with families and individuals in 
Encino, says several factors produce these kinds of exclusive relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 First, there is the difficulty of bringing outside friendships into the 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Couples end up on their own because they're unable to mix and match their 
friendships," Ruman says.  
</P>
<P>
 Especially when couples marry later, old friends who don't hit it off with the 
new spouse may gradually be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have couples who really enjoy one another's company most of all," she 
says. "We often hear about couples who lament how it's hard to find others they 
both can relate to." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Ruman says, these kinds of self-contained relationships are part 
of the cocooning trend that keeps many modern couples home alone. Rather than 
deal with traffic and crime, they would rather stay in and spend their limited 
free time with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if one were willing to cultivate new friendships, what with juggling 
careers, children and running a household, who has the energy or inclination? 
</P>
<P>
 Not Loretta Pafford. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get up at 5 in the morning and get home at 6:30 p.m. Who has time to 
socialize?" she laments. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlfred Broderick and his wife, Kathleen, both 62, are also friendly but 
happily friendless. 
</P>
<P>
 A sociology professor on the USC faculty, Broderick says that by the time they 
have taken care of the needs of their eight grown children and their children 
plus an assortment of relatives, he and his wife "don't have much energy and 
interest left over for outside friendships." 
</P>
<P>
 While some might view these self-contained relationships as stifling or even 
pathological, therapist Lasswell says they are often warm, loving and intimate. 
</P>
<P>
 However, they can have their downside. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, the children may feel left out, says Lasswell. When parents go 
on an extended vacation and leave the kids with a care giver, or even slip out 
to dinner without them, youngsters understand that the parents' relationship 
comes first. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, says Lasswell, "If these couples run into trouble, it's because 
they are so sensitive to each other that it's impossible (for one) to have a 
problem without the other being seriously affected." 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, in a "more balanced" relationship, when one is down, the other is up 
and vice versa, Lasswell says. The partners can balance each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this kind of marriage, when it's good, it's very good," she says, "but 
when it's bad, it's really bad."

FASHION INSIDE OUT; MAO, MAO, MAO -- HOW DO YOU LIKE IT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA GENDEL, TIMES FASHION EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most cerebral question posed by designers here centered on hemlines. 
Mid-thigh? Knee-grazing? Ankle-length? Mind-numbing? Oh, yes. 
</P>
<P>
 We'd rather mull over which of designer Vivienne Tam's Andy Warhol-esque 
Chairman Mao images are the most irreverent. Mao in pigtails? Mao with 
bubble-gum pink lips? Mao being stung on the nose by a bumblebee? 
</P>
<P>
 "That one is called 'Ow Mao,' " Tam said in her showroom Friday afternoon. The 
designer, who came to America from Hong Kong eight years ago, designed one of 
the most highly praised spring '95 collections. Her all-glass-bead dresses, 
black nylon mesh jackets and sheer white blouses with embroidered butterflies 
had fashion magazine editors clamoring for samples to photograph. 
</P>
<P>
 There was less enthusiasm in the Hong Kong factories where Tam's clothes are 
manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really hard finding someone who would do the work," she said. 
Specifically the Chairman Mao designs. "They were afraid. As it gets closer to 
1999, people there worry about what the future political climate will be." In 
1999, Hong Kong returns to its pre-British colony status as part of mainland 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 Tam's beautiful Audrey Hepburn cocktail dresses, imprinted with 
black-and-white photographic images of Mao, reflect her own position on the 
leader of old regime. "He did some positive things and he did some negative 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Tarentino Style: "Pulp Fiction" wormed its way through the New York 
collections in the form of gangster girl looks and Urge Overkill's subtly 
creepy rendition of "Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon." Come to think of it, a lot 
of cool guys here look like the group's lead singer, Nash Kato (who looks like 
a young Michael Caine): silky parted-down-the-middle hair, oversized 
blue-tinted shades and skinny hip-huggers. Meanwhile, "Pulp" star Uma Thurmond, 
bounding out of a store on 57th Street near the Plaza Hotel, looks more 
grungette than gangster. And in the Quentin Tarentino-produced "White Man's 
Burden," African American designer Tracy Reese and her collection will appear 
in a benefit fashion show. "Burden" depicts a world in which the ruling class 
is black. 
</P>
<P>
 Infantile Fantasies: Models are indisputably young, but they're getting a 
little competition from some even younger faces at the New York shows. The 
model Gisela carried her velvet-clad baby boy down the runway at DKNY. Richard 
Tyler and Lisa Trafficante's baby boy greeted well-wishers with a smile after 
Dad's Anne Klein show. Then there was the red-headed toddler who, during the 
Michael Kors show, was determined to get her tiny Maryjane-shod tootsies up 
onto the runway, even if it meant crawling over a photographer's head. Girl, 
you'll be a woman soon enough. 
</P>
<P>
 You're So Fine You Blow My Mind: As tabloid TV has noted with glee, the spirit 
-- not to mention the sweaty, stubbled body -- of lover-fighter-actor Mickey 
Rourke hung like a dark cloud over the fashion scene here. Even we weren't 
entirely Mickey-free. Upgraded by some lucky fluke to our hotel's penthouse, we 
were more than a little disappointed by its resemblance to a decadent '70s 
bachelor pad. The dark brown sueded walls, the nubby beige playpen sofa, the 
mirrored walls and the sauna in the dining room created a semi-revolting 
atmosphere. We shared our thoughts with the front desk gal. "Well . . . you 
know who used to live there, don't you?" she confided. Uh, Vinny Barbarino? 
"Mickey Rourke! He had the whole place decorated to his taste." Make that 
lover-fighter-actor-decorator.

TROOP CUTBACKS FOR HAITI, GULF REPORTEDLY SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. military troops in Haiti and the Persian Gulf region will begin returning 
home next month under a two-pronged phaseout hammered out over the weekend by 
President Clinton and his top national security advisers, sources said here 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The troop withdrawal decisions, approved by the President, call for 6,000 of 
the Army troops and U.S. Marines in Haiti to be on their way home by Dec. 1, 
and for "virtually all" of the almost 8,000 infantry soldiers to leave Kuwait 
by Dec. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said the decision to withdraw the troops was recommended Saturday in 
Washington by Clinton's top national security aides -- Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher; Defense Secretary William J. Perry; Gen. John M. 
Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Anthony Lake, the 
President's national security adviser. Clinton himself signed off on the 
decision Sunday while campaigning for Democratic candidates in California. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said the decision to withdraw the troops, although likely to 
prove politically popular, was not timed to coincide with the final days of 
campaigning for Tuesday's midterm congressional elections. In fact, the 
decision was not announced publicly, but many news organizations were told 
about it on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the White House did not make any official announcement on the 
decisions, senior Adminstration officials in the Pentagon and on the National 
Security Council confirmed the troop withdrawals in separate interviews Sunday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 In Haiti, the troop strength will be dropped to 9,000 from its present level 
of 15,000. Those pulling out will include military police personnel, some 
training battalions who will be replaced by members of the U.N. multinational 
forces, and logistic troops who have been handling many of the government's 
internal security matters until a new Haitian police force is established. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have just a hair under 9,000 ground troops left there," one defense 
official said. "Our troops there have been running much of the country's 
security and now we'll be turning this over to the civilians in Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that Lake, in a recent trip to Haiti where he met several times with 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, concluded that conditions had stabilized 
enough in the Caribbean island to handle the troop withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Gulf region, where the U.S. began dispatching troops last month to 
counter a sudden move by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein toward the Kuwaiti 
border, almost all of the 7,800 soldiers and Marines still there will be 
brought home by Dec. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you that every one of the ground troops will be gone, but that's 
going to be the goal," an Administration official said. "We'll be taking out 
virtually all of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plan has always been to draw down the troops as they completed their 
mission there, and we've never wanted to leave people there any longer than we 
had to." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that part of the reason to begin moving troops out of Kuwait was the 
fact that Hussein has withdrawn his elite Republican Guard units from the 
Kuwaiti border area, a signal that the crisis there was over. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, even with the ground troops leaving, U.S. military officials 
will continue to keep a high number of warplanes in the area to enforce the 
"no-fly" zone over southern Iraq and help prevent similar crises from occurring 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 There were about 77 U.S. aircraft in the region before the Republican Guard 
threatened Kuwait last month, and while the United States at first moved up to 
270 planes to the area, they will continue to base about 120 warplanes there. 
</P>
<P>
 As for ground troops in Kuwait, one defense official said that "the idea was 
never to leave them there forever." 
</P>
<P>
 He also noted that Clinton, in a recent visit with U.S. troops in the Gulf 
region, hinted that he would try to get them home by Christmas. That gesture, 
while boosting morale among soldiers in Kuwait, displeased many of those in 
Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Many soldiers in the Haitian contingents noted that they had been there twice 
as long as the soldiers sent to Kuwait, and that Clinton not only had not 
visited them in the Caribbean since their arrival there in September, but that 
the President also had not said when they might be coming home. 
</P>
<P>
 It remained unclear when the remaining troops in Haiti might be withdrawn.

COLUMN ONE; 'O.J. 101' ENLIVENS LAW SCHOOL; CAMPUSES ACROSS U.S. ARE USING THE 
FAMOUS CASE TO TEACH BASIC PRINCIPLES. JUDGE ITO EVEN ASKED TO SEE HARVARD 
STUDENTS' OPINIONS ON WHETHER TO BAN THE TV CAMERA.

 When Harvard professors Charles Nesson and Peter Murray were asked to overhaul 
"Introduction to Lawyering" for incoming students, their first decision was to 
put the 540 newcomers on-line, so they could punch up Supreme Court opinions 
and communicate by E-mail. 
</P>
<P>
 The class thus got its first subtitle: "Cyberlaw: A Course of Skills in Mind 
and Practice." 
</P>
<P>
 But that still left the professors with case material that had been used by 
Harvard's first-year, or "1L," law students for ages to learn such basics as 
how to write a legal brief: A woman stumbles in front of a drunk driver -- can 
her heirs sue the bar that tanked him up? That sort of thing. 
</P>
<P>
 The canned cases had Nesson shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can think of," he confided to Murray, "is O.J." 
</P>
<P>
 Bingo. Harvard's introductory class got a second subtitle: "The Law and O.J. 
Simpson." 
</P>
<P>
 From the start of the fall semester, the 1Ls have been taught the fundamentals 
through the legal machinations taking place 3,000 miles away in Los Angeles 
Superior Court. They were given a reading list that included "Juice: The O.J. 
Simpson Tragedy" by the Globe supermarket tabloid. And they are tapped into 
"O.J. Info-bases" as well as Supreme Court rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 It was hardly what the lawyers-to-be expected in the ivy-covered halls of 
Harvard. But as computer bulletin boards put them in touch with students 
elsewhere, they found that their professors were not the only ones who had 
decided that a case often derided for its sensationalism might be a godsend for 
the serious study of law. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it has become an instant ingredient in the curriculum from Yale to 
UCLA. The trial is being offered up as Exhibit A to spur discussions of 
relevance, hearsay, weight of evidence, search-and-seizure, expert testimony, 
impeachment of witnesses, media access . . . the list goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 As Robert L. Shapiro and Marcia Clark quizzed prospective jurors on the ninth 
floor of the Los Angeles Criminal Courts Building, students at the University 
of San Francisco were conducting their own voir dire in a moot court. Some took 
the roles of defense lawyers and prosecutors while others were potential jurors 
being probed on their attitudes toward DNA evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere has the case played such a central role, however, as at Harvard, alma 
mater of four of the nine Supreme Court justices. Last month the trial became 
more than an academic exercise here when Judge Lance A. Ito got word of the 1L 
course and had a clerk call Nesson. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Oct. 12, the professor rushed out a notice reporting that Ito 
"would like to receive copies of our best student memoranda on the questions 
the judge now faces in determining whether to ban cameras from the courtroom." 
</P>
<P>
 With Ito having already scheduled a hearing on the issue for today, 150 
students were mobilized, in 59 small groups, to write memos. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started," says Murray, "no one would have guessed that we would not 
only study the case, but become part of the case." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A videotape plays on a screen in front of the Austin North lecture hall as 135 
students filter into the amphitheater that has hosted Harvard law classes for a 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 The video shows law school alumni at a reunion seminar. "What were they 
talking about?" Murray asks. "O.J.!" 
</P>
<P>
 The old graduates' interest is reassuring to Nesson and Murray. They had felt 
some trepidation about using a sexy, media-darling case of the moment in a 
school known for its stern traditionalism -- exemplified by the mythical Prof. 
Kingsfield of "The Paper Chase." 
</P>
<P>
 Nesson, 55, has been a professor here for nearly three decades, though hardly 
in the Kingsfield mold -- he eschews coats and ties for turtlenecks and uses 
the computer sign-on "Eon." He tells the students that one 79-year-old alumnus, 
Harold Brown, had written a memo to provoke debate at his 55th reunion -- and 
picked the very "Ito issue" they were tackling. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown reviewed sensational trials in the past 100 years (Scopes and Lizzie 
Borden, among others) and concluded that the Simpson case highlighted a 
disturbing new development, "the entertainment defense," marked by "dramatic 
manipulation of the public." 
</P>
<P>
 But today's class hardly centers on such a broad question. Facing the students 
is the nitty-gritty of law: the writing of a brief. 
</P>
<P>
 A "Power Points" slide pops on the screen, and Murray tells how even the 
smallest feature of a brief -- section headings, say -- must advance the "core 
theory." 
</P>
<P>
 So what pops on the screen next? An actual heading from the district 
attorney's brief defending the search of Simpson's home after the slayings of 
his ex-wife Nicole and her friend Ronald Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 The heading begins, "Exigent Circumstances Justified the Warrantless Search 
Onto the Premises at 360 Rockingham. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The professors become legal sharpshooters. Murray praises how the language 
"depersonalized" Simpson's home into a "premises." But, as he sees it, the 
prosecutors otherwise blew a chance to underscore the need to immediately get 
into the estate because of "concern over the safety of the occupants." 
</P>
<P>
 And the defense? Talk of wasted opportunities! The same section of its brief 
was headed: "Exigent Circumstances." That's it. Two words. 
</P>
<P>
 "An argument without an argument!" Murray laments -- when the defense could 
have pointed out how there was "no emergency" compelling police to leap into 
Simpson's home (not an anonymous premises) and how it was "a whole lot of 
detectives going in to get the goods on somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon the class is examining other headings in the briefs and asking, "How can 
we try to rewrite it?" 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is a process more brutal than any media grilling. Virtually 
every word written by the legal teams in L.A., in the heat of battle, is going 
to be torn apart and second-guessed by two Harvard professors and 540 students 
-- many of whom next semester will themselves face the critical eye of one of 
Simpson's attorneys, criminal law professor Alan Dershowitz. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, American law schools have used a top-down approach, one that 
focuses on the cases that generated key Supreme Court rulings over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the era of Court TV has provided raw material hard to ignore. What better 
way is there to illustrate how two sides in a case portray the same facts 
differently than showing the Rodney G. King videotape? To the prosecution, it's 
clear brutality. To the defense, "textbook" police work. 
</P>
<P>
 USC professor Charles Whitebread, who is using the Simpson case in a criminal 
procedure class, sees trade-offs in de-emphasizing the "canned cases in the 
textbook." 
</P>
<P>
 Textbook cases "are useful for clearing away facts" and focusing on legal 
principles, he says. Live cases, though, remind students how "factual issues 
may often be muddy in a real case" -- and how results turn on quirks of the 
facts as often as on abstract principles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes the class more relevant," says USC law student Tara Kelly. "It's not 
like something that happened 100 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Yale professor Kate Stith starts her criminal law course by writing well-known 
defendants' names on a blackboard. Last year, they included Lorena Bobbitt, the 
Menendez brothers and Bernard Goetz. 
</P>
<P>
 Stith reminds her students that none were convicted of the worst charges they 
faced -- and asks why. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the students inevitably "have some notions that are too facile," Stith 
says, "the truth is (they) already know a lot about criminal law when they walk 
in the classroom. Discussing these cases . . . makes them feel they belong 
there from the first day." 
</P>
<P>
 Her students will find a new name on the blackboard this year. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's Peter Arenella has used Simpson proceedings to illustrate "the 
importance of strategic decisions by a lawyer," such as whether to contest the 
search of Simpson's home at the preliminary hearing or wait to do it in 
Superior Court, when the defense has more evidence to challenge police actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Arenella, who has served as a TV legal analyst on the Simpson trial, is 
nevertheless wary of overusing a case that, because of the resources, "does not 
provide an accurate window into how our criminal justice system usually 
operates. Students need to be reminded that, in the typical criminal 
prosecution, there is far less litigation in the pretrial process and (it) does 
not end with a trial -- but with a plea bargain in 90% of the cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the fact that Simpson lawyers can afford battles on every 
constitutional and evidentiary issue is exactly what generates fodder for the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 At the University of San Francisco, Robert E. Talbot has used the case in an 
orientation program for minority students -- to introduce concepts such as mens 
rea , mental state -- and in the moot court for his "Science and Litigation" 
seminar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it, murder is interesting," Talbot says. "They don't have a TV 
show called, 'Civil Procedure, She Wrote.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But most legal issues have dissenters, and Loyola Law School's Sam Pillsbury 
remains skeptical of the pedagogical value of the Simpson case; he's not 
convinced it has captured students' imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not? Pillsbury says his students generally look forward to careers in 
civil law, meaning "it's not the kind of law most of them see themselves 
practicing. Most law students, especially with the loans they have now, are 
expecting to go out and make more money than you do as a criminal lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard student teacher Greg Duhl, a 3L, is planning a career in "exciting tax 
law," but that hasn't kept him from getting swept up in O.J. mania. When he was 
a 1L, his class was given the drunk driving material based on a settled New 
York case. He envies the current 1Ls who have material so fresh "it's like 
they're the lawyers in the case." 
</P>
<P>
 On this afternoon, Duhl, in blue jeans and a baseball cap, leads a workshop 
for a dozen 1Ls. He begins with a rumor -- that the professors are "sending all 
59 Ito memos to Ito." 
</P>
<P>
 A week earlier, the 1Ls had been asked to research issues such as: What are 
the limits of a judge's power to ban TV coverage in court? Can he control media 
activity outside court? Is there a constitutional "right to know" that affects 
his rulings? 
</P>
<P>
 Now, one 1L seems nervous that all the memos, including hers, may be read by 
Ito. "Did someone, like, look over them?" she asks. 
</P>
<P>
 Duhl nods. "Some were really good," he says. "And some. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Well, one memo had a footnote that went a page and a half, listing every case 
affirming judges' discretion to ban cameras. Another had a novel idea, Duhl 
says: that rather than have TV crews tape the trial, Ito "puts his own camera 
in the court, then he sells the tape." 
</P>
<P>
 The students laugh, until he cuts them off with, "Let's start!" 
</P>
<P>
 The seminar is designed to help the 1Ls while they write briefs on issues such 
as the admissibility of 911 tapes that apparently capture Simpson yelling at 
his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1Ls are told they must learn to present facts "from a particular point of 
view." To show that some Harvard traditions refuse to die, they try it first 
not with O.J. material, but "mythological cases." 
</P>
<P>
 They will argue the facts of Goldilocks vs. The Three Bears. The bears are 
suing for trespass. 
</P>
<P>
 The future legal leaders break into groups, then begin the argument: 
</P>
<P>
 "We the bears came home to find that our house had been broken into, that our 
porridge had been eaten, our beds had been slept in, our prized baby chair had 
been broken," says Nalini Pande of McLean, Va., speaking for the plaintiffs. 
She also claims that Mama Bear had suffered emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rachel Blum of Philadelphia dismisses the incident as "simple error" by 
Goldilocks, a poor housekeeper who accidentally wandered into the wrong home 
and only fell asleep in the bears' bed because "she has narcolepsy." 
</P>
<P>
 "I assume you have medical proof?" the other side calls out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh sure. If you have proof of trauma." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides laugh and go back into groups -- to hash out competing portrayals 
of the 911 tape. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, the 1Ls are back in the lecture hall. 
</P>
<P>
 In the rear are boxes of reprints of the memos just sent to Ito. And the rumor 
was wrong -- the professors shipped only a dozen to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 They also included -- in the prized top spot -- the memo by the 79-year-old 
alumnus. 
</P>
<P>
 The memo with the big footnote didn't make the cut. Nor the one urging Ito to 
film the trial himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Nesson doesn't make it easier for those whose memos were not sent. He 
explains, "This is a kind of grade, a first event, where people were 
distinguished. . . . I selected strictly because of . . . which ideas stayed 
with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon afterward, the screen is alive with a "Nightline" debate. It features 
Leslie Abramson, the in-your-face Menendez lawyer, and the Harvard faculty's 
star, Laurence Tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 Abramson is defending Ito's decision -- later eased a bit -- to bar reporters 
from jury selection because of a "runaway circus-performing media." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tribe lambastes the judge, suggesting that he went against a 1984 ruling 
in another California case, in which "the Supreme Court made absolutely clear, 
9-0, that judges can't just intuit these things." 
</P>
<P>
 The class is off and running. Because Tribe has not named the case he used to 
"deck Judge Ito," Nesson tells the students, "We've got to find Larry's case." 
</P>
<P>
 A legal computer is activated in the lecture hall, and a search launched -- 
projected on the screen. Key words are punched in: 1984. California. Jury. 
Media.  
</P>
<P>
 "This looks like the one!" someone says as a Supreme Court opinion pops up, 
Press Enterprise vs. Riverside County, stemming from a murder trial in which a 
judge not only barred the media from court during jury selection, but refused 
to release a transcript of most of the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 To the surprise of the class, Nesson declares the facts "very different" than 
those in Los Angeles, because Ito was not calling for such a complete blackout. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, Nesson is siding with Abramson over his distinguished Harvard 
colleague! 
</P>
<P>
 So go the twists in "Cyberlaw meets O.J. Simpson," a course where no one asks 
any longer how the classroom relates to the real world. By now, they have been 
intertwined beyond distinction. 
</P>
<P>
 If that wasn't clear before, it certainly was when word of the Harvard course 
spread and TV crews began knocking on the classroom door. 
</P>
<P>
 The professors said the students should vote on it, and so they did, those 
fledgling Judge Itos -- and banned the cameras. 
</P>

BOUNTIFUL SALINAS VALLEY HAS BUMPER CROP OF WOES; FARMS: PROBLEMS INCLUDE 
OVERPRODUCTION, SEAWATER INTRUSION. SOME PIN HOPES ON QUEST FOR TASTIER 
LETTUCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 People in these parts still think of Floyd Griffin as a bit of an outsider, a 
Johnny-come-lately to the Kingdom of the Crispheads. 
</P>
<P>
 He's only lived in the Salad Bowl of America since 1968 -- the kind of place 
where you sure can grow vegetables but you sure can't buy land. His "recent" 
arrival in itself is a minor black mark in this tight little fraternity of 
four-generation farm families. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's the way he feels about iceberg, the king of crops in the land 
of lettuce: He eats it. He likes it. But he's spending good money to change it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're working toward taste, truly we are," promises the secretary-treasurer 
of Mission Packing, a multi-state farm firm that is using genetic engineering 
to breed next-generation iceberg with the help of a major seed company from 
Holland. "We're only a couple of years away." 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad they can't speed things up, for these are grim days in the Salinas 
Valley, site of the richest farmland in America. A yearlong iceberg glut has 
driven prices to historical lows. Frustrated farmers are willing to try most 
anything to improve their ailing market. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, when iceberg lettuce turned 100 this year, the only party was in 
Pennsylvania, where seed giant W. Atlee Burpee & Co. threw an August birthday 
bash complete with Creme de la Creme Iceberg Soup With Mint, and Light Iceberg 
Latkes With Chives. 
</P>
<P>
 Lettuce growers here spent the summer grappling with overproduction that 
caused losses of up to $1,500 an acre in a region that plants about 72,000 
acres of iceberg each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they're digging in for the nastiest water war in California today, a 
battle that pits farmers against each other instead of their urban 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salinas Valley water war is among the most crucial in California, says 
Edward C. Anton, chief of the division of water rights at the state Water 
Resources Control Board. And its current remedy is among the rarest: The state 
has just begun the lengthy process of stepping in and taking over. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Salinas Valley has a unique combination of climate and soil that allows 
it to produce a lot of very valuable produce," says Anton, who testified about 
the controversy last month at legislative hearings in the tiny Salinas Valley 
town of Spreckles. "That's among the reasons why it (water) is such a concern." 
</P>
<P>
 The water war threatens a 90-mile swath of farmland that is both bountiful and 
beautiful. Salinas native John Steinbeck took an entire chapter in "East of 
Eden" to describe the valley that gave him plots and poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember that the Gabilan Mountains to the east of the valley were light 
gay mountains full of sun and loveliness and a kind of invitation, so that you 
wanted to climb into their warm foothills almost as you want to climb into the 
lap of a beloved mother," he wrote in the 1952 novel. "They were beckoning 
mountains with a brown grass love. The Santa Lucias stood up against the sky to 
the west and kept the valley from the open sea, and they were dark and brooding 
-- unfriendly and dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 George Ball, Burpee chairman and chief executive, is neither Nobel laureate 
nor California native, but he, too, finds it easy to muster up a shred of the 
poet when he speaks of the land that made his company's product a household 
name. While he might not speak of "brown grass love" when contemplating the 
verdant swath from San Ardo in the south to Castroville in the north, he will 
rhapsodize about "those beautiful, sharp, sunlit days" that make the Salinas 
Valley the iceberg capital of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 But iceberg is far from the only crop, as is easily seen at Art Manzoni's 
farms just outside of Greenfield, the self-proclaimed broccoli capital of the 
world. Manzoni has been growing crops in the southern Salinas Valley for 47 
years, from his high school days as the Carrot King of King City High to this, 
iceberg's centenary. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, his fields are a constant patchwork of growth and cultivation. Climate, 
he says, is the Salinas Valley's secret weapon, the thing that lets him, his 
son and his brother plant spinach in chill November, iceberg seven months out 
of 12 and hardy broccoli all year 'round. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a junior in high school, my dad gave me 15 acres of land here for 
Future Farmers of America," he said as he maneuvered his mud-splashed pickup 
through the fields. "I gambled and grew carrots on the open market. I made 
$30,000. In 1947, that was a lot of money. It's still the talk of the town." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, however, is a different story. The $2,000-an-acre carrots of Manzoni's 
youth pale beside the $11,000-an-acre strawberries grown in Monterey County and 
the $11,000 an acre that lettuce can bring in here in a good year -- a year 
unlike this last one. 
</P>
<P>
 Monterey County -- basically the Salinas Valley, for there is little 
agriculture in the county outside the valley -- grossed $1.85 billion in 
agricultural receipts in 1993, the most it has raked in since early Spanish 
farmers began cultivating corn, wheat and sheep here in the late 1700s. 
</P>
<P>
 Although three counties in the nation -- Fresno, Tulare and Kern -- brought in 
more agricultural dollars last year than Monterey, the numbers are deceiving. 
Sure, Fresno County pulled in $3.01 billion, about 60% more than Monterey. But 
it accomplished that feat on 1.23 million acres -- nearly five times the 
acreage of its agricultural neighbor to the west. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salinas Valley grows more than 50% of the nation's share of five pricey 
vegetables: head lettuce, artichokes, broccoli, cauliflower and leaf lettuce. 
In short, says Gerry Willey, deputy Monterey County agricultural commissioner, 
Salinas Valley farmland is the most fruitful in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of making money on their lactuca sativa this year, most farmers 
here and in the nation's seven other lettuce-growing states are losing it -- up 
to $1,500 an acre for most of the past 13 months, Willey says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to have a certain character to grow lettuce," marvels Willey, who 
likens the lettuce field to the craps table and the stock exchange. Lettuce 
farmers "can make a lot of money. It's almost like Reno. You can go in there 
and lose your shirt continually. Or you're just lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as with many lettuce farmers this past year, you're actually part of the 
problem, unable as yet to manage the changes caused by the biggest agricultural 
innovation to hit the Salinas Valley since the '50s, the so-called "value added 
product." 
</P>
<P>
 You've seen them take up increasing shelf space in the produce section of your 
favorite market, those bright new bags of chopped and washed lettuce leaves -- 
some with dressing and croutons tossed in -- for which harried urban shoppers 
are willing to pay extra. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole Fresh Vegetables thinks such products are here to stay and has built a 
multimillion-dollar packaging plant in the Salinas Valley. Tanimura & Antle, 
the biggest independent lettuce grower in the country, has a full line of 
products, from fresh spinach to Caesar salad. And the latest Monterey County 
agricultural report notes that such products grew by more than 50% between 1992 
and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But are they any good and will they last? Most growers acknowledge that they 
smell sort of swampy when you open up a bag, that they last maybe three days as 
opposed to three weeks. Bob Nunes, Jr., whose family firm is just now building 
a processing plant on the East Coast to chop and pack their Tubby brand 
lettuce, says he and his wife, well, used to eat them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a phase," Nunes says. "We don't do it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's that little math problem that has dogged lettuce growers 
throughout the country for the past year. Instead of acknowledging that 
consumers eat a finite amount of lettuce and bagging some of their existing 
crop, they planted extra. Compounding the problem was perfect weather and an 
abundant harvest. What consumers haven't eaten, farmers have. It's called 
oversupply, and it hurts. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to that scenario the state of California stepping in to solve what farmers 
insist is "just a local water problem" and you get a large group of very 
independent, very annoyed men and women in work boots stomping up and down the 
valley. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is seawater intrusion -- ocean water contaminating the underground 
water supply. It was first noticed in 1944 in the north county city of 
Castroville, the artichoke capital of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers and water districts in the Salinas Valley get their water by pumping 
it from the underground aquifer. Under normal circumstances, that water is 
replenished, generally by rain. By the 1960s, two dams had been built in the 
south county to help replenish the aquifer. 
</P>
<P>
 But since those dams were built, two things have happened to strain the 
underground water supply. The population of the area's cities, from Salinas to 
Soledad, has grown. The greatest impact, however, has been the nearly 60,000 
acres of new irrigated farmland -- most in the southern part of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, more water has been pulled out of the aquifer than has been 
replenished. The imbalance in pressure has caused seawater to be sucked into 
the aquifer in coastal Salinas Valley. Last year, seawater contamination was 
discovered within a mile of the city of Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
 In its simplest form, the water fight can be looked at as artichokes against 
the world. Farmers in Castroville -- home of the Giant Artichoke Restaurant 
with its artichoke quiche and artichoke soup -- have been most affected by the 
seawater intrusion. They are the ones who most want a series of costly remedies 
that farmers and residents throughout the county would be forced to pay for. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Pat Hopper, marketing director for the California Artichoke and Vegetable 
Growers Corp., "If this acreage goes out, where will we go? Your quality of 
life will go down. We need the climate here to grow artichokes." 
</P>
<P>
 In the south county, where farmers are 50 miles from the direct effects of the 
seawater, the feeling is that north county growers are reaping what they sowed, 
that the problem is not the south county's to suffer or solve. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turns out that 97% to 98% of the seawater intrusion is directly related to 
the pumping in the exact vicinity (where) the saltwater intrusion is 
occurring," insists Ralph Riva, chairman of the Salinas Valley Water Coalition. 
"I can't do much for them. They have to accept the responsibility and make the 
hard calls." 
</P>
<P>
 Because they have endured but not solved the intrusion problem, Monterey 
County farmers are about to receive letters from the state water board telling 
them to get their records ready. The state is embarking on the lengthy 
investigation that could precede an official weighing of interests and 
parceling out of the ground water supply. All bets are off on whether the state 
will actually go through with such a severe process -- one that has been 
initiated but never before completed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interim, a small army of Salinas Valley lettuce breeders is working 
fast and furiously to improve the crop that drives the region's agricultural 
engine. People like Floyd Griffin's son, David, a genetic engineer, and Edward 
J. Ryder, the last of the great government lettuce breeders, are hard at work 
on a hardier -- and tastier -- head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly I would hope that (seawater intrusion) would not be so much of a 
deterrent that we would willingly give away the agricultural industry," says 
Ryder, a staunch iceberg defender. "But the possibility of doing some breeding 
work to enable lettuce to grow even in a higher salt environment is a real 
one." The Billion-Dollar Club 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the dollar value of the crops it produces, Monterey County is the No. 
4 agricultural county in California, more than a billion dollars behind Fresno 
County, the nation's agricultural powerhouse. However, Monterey County has 
about 250,000 acres in production -- most in the Salinas Valley -- while Fresno 
has nearly five times that amount. That makes the Salinas Valley the richest 
farmland in the nation. This chart shows that state's top-grossing agricultural 
counties and the acreage in production.

IN SYRIA, ASSAD'S WORDS SPEAK LOUDER THAN DEEDS; MIDEAST: DAMASCUS WANTS 
LEADER'S DESIRE FOR PEACE TAKEN ON FAITH. BUT ISRAEL, OTHERS DEMAND ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The library was bursting out of the old house, so Suheil Zakkar built a large 
hall upstairs and laid in more books. There are more than 30,000 in all, a 
musty gilt, leather and ink shrine to the eras when Arabs fashioned an alphabet 
to set down their violent and lovely tales and liberated Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 Zakkar, Syria's premier historian, spends most of his hours at a cramped desk 
in the shadow of his towering shelves, writing a new history of the Crusades in 
26 volumes, this one through Arab eyes. It has been funded personally by Syrian 
President Hafez Assad. Next, Assad is commissioning a history of Damascus, 
believed to be the world's oldest inhabited city. 
</P>
<P>
 Zakkar spends his days recording and preserving a civilization. He leaves it 
to his tough-minded political benefactors to fashion the future. Destiny weaves 
a fine web of the two. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a man named Hajib who in pre-Islamic history asked for wheat from 
the Persians. And when they said, 'How will you pay?' he said, 'I cannot give 
you more than my word' and (made) a small wooden bow. And the Persian emperor 
gave him what he needed. It took years after that, and Hajib died. But after 
those years, the tribe repaid the wheat," Zakkar recounted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, when President Assad said we are going to make peace with Israel, we 
have nothing to give but his word," he said. "They say that isn't enough. What 
shall we give them? Shall we give them Damascus as a hostage? If they want 
peace, they have to trust us. Let them try, and they will not lose. But let 
them not try, and they will surely lose." 
</P>
<P>
 As U.S. analysts sought to pinpoint new landmarks for Middle East peace forged 
by Assad's crucial meeting recently with President Clinton, it was rough going. 
The stubborn Syrian leader had repeated his demand for a full return of Syria's 
occupied Golan Heights and balked at publicly condemning a recent wave of 
terrorist acts in neighboring Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 He again declined to offer gestures proving he was serious about peace -- he 
made no offers to meet with Israeli officials, declined all talk of an Israeli 
Embassy in Damascus and refused even to send envoys to last week's Middle East 
economic summit with Israeli leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Damascus, the aging Assad's meaning was clear: In unequivocal terms, he 
had offered peace in exchange for occupied territory. He had defined peace as a 
strategic objective. Now, in the Syrian view that reaches back as far as 
history, it is up to Israel to take him, and this nation, at his word. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Syria said we want peace, the expectation in Syria is this statement 
should be believed," said Yehya Aridi, a political analyst close to Assad and a 
former professor at Washington's Georgetown University. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it is equally clear that Syria's peace will come on its own terms, in its 
own time. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was an example for us when (PLO Chairman Yasser) Arafat and the 
Israelis went to Washington. They shook hands. They embraced even," Aridi said. 
"Do you feel Arafat has achieved peace now? How many Palestinians are happy 
with what has happened? Very, very few. Those who have an interest in Arafat 
getting them money. Does peace mean having money? There's something more 
valuable than that. There is dignity. There is the honor of the person. There 
is a saying in Arabic, 'Land is honor.' 
</P>
<P>
 "We have lived a long time like this, and we can live a long time longer," 
Aridi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This land," he added, "is the first piece of Earth to have seen the sun. It 
is the cradle of civilization. The first alphabet was found here. It is the 
home of prophets. For this reason, we do no accept to be insulted. We do not 
accept to lose our dignity. And we have no need to make you feel comfortable. 
When we believe we are older than history, we can wait for a long, long time." 
</P>
<P>
 After the recent peace treaty signings by Jordan and the Palestinians, U.S. 
officials had hoped, with Clinton's intervention, to speed Syria to the peace 
table too. But by all indications, Syria is in no hurry. Far from eager to join 
the rush toward treaties with Israel, Syria is both the key to an enduring 
peace in the Middle East and the one nation most likely to stand in the way of 
its rapid realization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Assad has been talking the same game for 20 years. It's remarkable how 
consistent he's been. So nobody should hold out hope for bold new gestures," 
said a diplomat in the Syrian capital in the wake of Clinton's visit. "Assad 
has made the decision to seek peace, but at the moment, he has nothing 
compelling him to seek anything but the best possible deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts here say Syria is ready to make peace on its own terms, but because 
of a number of factors, it cannot be expected to join Jordan and the Palestine 
Liberation Organization in signing a quick treaty, or one that compromises 
Damascus' basic demand for a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Syria doesn't face the same economic imperatives -- a crushing need for 
foreign debt relief, a cutoff in financing from the Arab Gulf states, rising 
joblessness -- that pushed Arafat and Jordan's King Hussein into Israel's arms. 
</P>
<P>
 The demise several years ago of its former benefactor, the Soviet Union, 
backed Syria into abandoning its hope of ever defeating Israel militarily. But 
Syria has moved rapidly to forge new ties with the West and take a path toward 
economic self-sufficiency, with encouraging results. 
</P>
<P>
 While imports have doubled over the past six years, the Syrian pound has 
remained stable with a substantial increase in agricultural and industrial 
production that has fueled new exports. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of importing food, Syria five years ago began exporting farm 
goods, nearly doubling production of cotton and quadrupling citrus production. 
Since 1988, petroleum production has grown by 150%, with 60% of it exported to 
foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
 A fledgling private sector -- still vastly overshadowed by the lumbering state 
industries fostered under decades of Arab Baathist socialism -- is opening 
factories and developing markets abroad for Syrian goods, mainly garments and 
foodstuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial exchange with neighboring Lebanon -- a virtual captive with 40,000 
Syrian troops stationed there -- has grown from $50 million to $500 million a 
year since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the last Middle Eastern country that needs economic aid, and yet we 
have continuous hopes that the U.S. will have an honest stand toward us," said 
Elias Nejma, an economics professor at Damascus University and member of 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Syria has made it clear that it hopes the United States will lift the 
crippling restrictions on aid and investment that stem from Syria's designation 
as a nation that supports international terrorism and drug-dealing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nejma said Syria was in no hurry to join last week's economic summit in 
Casablanca, Morocco, where Arab nations -- except Syria and Lebanon -- met to 
begin forging a new, joint economic future. "They're asking us to cooperate 
with Israel even before we cooperate with ourselves as Arabs," Nejma 
complained. "It is a mere maneuver to submit the economies of the Middle East 
to the Israeli economy." 
</P>
<P>
 There is an even more basic reason why Assad is in no hurry for peace: Over 
the past 25 years, he has built his empire on confrontation with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 In the name of uniting the nation against a common enemy, Assad has ruthlessly 
stifled dissent at home, quelling unrest within Syria's diverse Christian and 
Muslim ethnic communities and brutally putting down Islamic fundamentalist 
opposition. He has built a well-equipped army of 400,000 and an accompanying 
security apparatus that now forms the underpinnings of his regime. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens when there is no more enemy? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's clear they have learned some lessons from the disintegration of 
the Soviet Union after the Cold War, and their intent is not to let that 
happen," one Western envoy said. "That's a big unknown even in Assad's mind: 
what forces peace would set off. And that's probably accounting for some of his 
caution." 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials privately admit they are worried that Syria could see the 
same wave of Islamic fundamentalism that has mounted a vocal opposition to 
peace with Israel in Egypt, Jordan and the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Assad, they say, believes he can head off such opposition only by winning the 
whole of the Golan Heights back from Israeli occupation, a belief that in his 
mind renders a partial Israeli withdrawal, or a withdrawal leaving in place 
Israeli settlements, completely unacceptable at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell his people we made peace with Israel without half the Golan, he won't 
be accepted as a leader, the stability we have will not last very long," said 
one Baath Arab Socialist Party official, who also made a reference to Assad's 
quelling of Islamic fervor in 1982 by virtually destroying the city of Hama. 
"All those difficult years are still in the back of our minds. They (the 
Islamists) don't have a slogan to attract the people, but if you give them a 
subject like this, any concessions on the Golan Heights, they will ignite their 
engine again. This is the fear of all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps equally threatening are the demands of the generals who have built 
their own empires in Syria through three decades of war. "The strongest voice 
resisting peace right now comes from the people in the military and security 
apparatus who have been making fortunes (from confrontation with Israel)," one 
Western diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Western analysts here say there are indications that Assad is preparing 
himself to meet Israel's inevitable demand that the Syrian army be shrunk. In 
August and September, the government announced the retirement of 15 army 
generals, together with a number of other important job shuffles that included 
the appointment of a new chief of the air force and a new intelligence chief. 
</P>
<P>
 "One way of looking at it is that Assad is moving out the Old Guard, preparing 
for the day when the downsizing has to happen," an envoy in Damascus said. 
"Even going so far as to eventually cut the army in half, it's not impossible. 
He could do it, and he could get away with it, as long as Assad is Assad. And 
now we are seeing indications that he is already beginning to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps just as troublesome, many analysts say, will be the inevitable demands 
for political change that could accompany an end to the standoff with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 At Damascus University, students and academics quietly debated the outcome of 
Clinton's trip, and many were looking further ahead than a simple end to 
hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The price of war has been very heavy, and it must be said that we hope for a 
change in the level of political life. We will expect democracy if peace 
comes," one young professor said, lowering his voice and surveying the sidewalk 
around him as he spoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government has always said the enemy, Israel, is there, and it's 
necessary to fight it together. It is a pretext . . . " he said. "And when 
peace arrives, it will be necessary for us to search for democracy. The 
government will stay after peace, I am sure. But they must find another 
strategy of governing. The politics of terror, we have to finish with all 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Zakkar, for his part, said he is an advocate of peace but will take his enmity 
for Israel with him to his grave: "I am ready to make peace, but I am not ready 
to make friends. And I will not do it. I am accepting peace, and no more. And 
let time do its business."

REPUBLICANS POISED TO GAIN -- BUT HOW BIG?; ELECTION: GOP MAY HAVE BETTER SHOT 
AT SENATE MAJORITY THAN AT HOUSE CONTROL. DEMOCRATS BRACE FOR SOME LOSSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the 1994 midterm election heads into its final hours, Republicans are 
poised to score gains sweeping enough to undermine -- and perhaps overturn -- 
Democratic command of Capitol Hill and give the GOP a strong hand in charting 
the nation's political future. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a campaign Democrats have always known they would lose. And despite 
apparent last-minute recoveries by some of their candidates, the only question 
that remains before Tuesday's balloting begins is how large the loss will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviews with strategists in both parties indicate that Republicans have at 
least a 50-50 chance of seizing control of the Senate, where Democrats now 
enjoy a 56-44 advantage. The GOP is expected to pick up no fewer than four 
seats and perhaps as many as nine. 
</P>
<P>
 On the House side, the odds are longer against the Republicans ousting the 
long-entrenched Democratic majority, but the possibility cannot be ruled out. 
In any case, the Republicans are expected to add at least 25 seats to their 
current holding of 178 -- against 256 for the Democrats. This would put 
Republican House strength above the 200 figure for the first time since they 
briefly controlled that chamber in the first two years of Dwight D. 
Eisenhower's presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're going to retain actual control of both the House and Senate, 
and lose effective control of both," was Democratic pollster Mark Mellman's 
gloomy assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican House and Senate gains on the scale predicted by analysts in both 
parties would have powerful long-range implications. They would leave the GOP 
better positioned than at any time in recent memory to take command of both 
houses of Congress -- as well as the presidency -- in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 In the contests for governorships, late polling results suggest Republicans 
still have a plausible chance of winning in several major states now held by 
Democrats, although GOP chances of wresting New York away seemed to be 
slipping. And Republicans are confident of holding on to the richest prize of 
all, California. 
</P>
<P>
 Fueling the Republican surge is a flood of voter discontent verging on outrage 
-- along with the unsettling effect on incumbents of the decennial 
redistricting and a flock of Democratic retirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest evidence was provided by a New York Times/CBS News poll released 
last week that showed only about 20% of those surveyed approved of the job 
Congress is doing. And only that same small share of the sample said they 
believed that they could trust the government in Washington most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Voters are frustrated with government," said the Democratic Party's senior 
campaign strategist, Tony Coelho, himself a former member of the House. "They 
think they pay too much and get too little back." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday's anticipated results seem likely to produce even more frustration 
among the citizenry. The outlook is for heightened partisan warfare in 
Washington, where Republicans under Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas 
and House Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia were feisty enough during the last 
congressional session to impede major initiatives by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's worst nightmare has to be a Republican-controlled Senate, 
which would put Dole in charge of the flow of business and would install other 
Republicans as chairmen of Senate committees. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm in the Clinton White House, my immediate worry is that (New York Sen.) 
Alfonse D'Amato is head of the Senate Banking Committee," said Republican 
consultant Anthony Fabrizio. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Senate's most aggressive critics of the Whitewater affair, D'Amato 
would be expected to push for a further probe into the events stemming from 
Clinton's Arkansas real estate investment and its connection to a failed 
savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without a majority, Republicans in the 104th Congress will likely be 
well-positioned to challenge the President's ability to dominate the national 
political scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we will be able to control the political debate," said Republican 
pollster William McInturff. He said he envisages the enlarged GOP cadre on 
Capitol Hill teaming up with conservative Democrats to form a "center-right 
coalition." This alliance, McInturff theorizes, could force Clinton to choose 
between compromising with the conservatives -- thus weakening his hold on his 
party's liberal base -- or vetoing legislation, which the Republicans could 
exploit to energize their 1996 drive for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine the world where Republicans who voted for term limits, a 
balanced-budget amendment and cuts in congressional staff could wrap themselves 
in that package and go to the country in 1996 and say: 'We're the change,' " 
McInturff said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be very difficult for Clinton to get things done," said Ross Baker, a 
Rutgers University specialist in congressional affairs, because the election 
results are likely to sharpen the schism between the two parties. Baker points 
out that the Democratic members of Congress most likely to survive Tuesday's 
Republican onslaught are those from the most liberal districts, thus pushing 
the Democratic House contingent to the left. But the Republicans, he says, will 
be at least as conservative as ever, "and in no mood to bargain." 
</P>
<P>
 But even in victory, the Republicans will face problems of their own. Expanded 
responsibility is likely to deepen fissures in their party -- exposed most 
notably when Republican New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani backed the candidacy 
of Democratic Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, and Los Angeles Republican Mayor Richard 
Riordan endorsed Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Bob Dole becomes majority leader in the Senate and Newt (Gingrich) becomes 
de facto leader of a conservative coalition in the House, then our party will 
have to lead," Fabrizio said. "But Gingrich's goal will be to build a 
Republican majority in 1996, and Dole's goal will probably be to get himself 
elected President." 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of their grim prospects, Democrats have taken what comfort they 
can from the belief that an even worse disaster has been averted. They cite the 
apparent ability of one of the party's most revered liberal icons, 
Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, and a number of lesser known House 
incumbents to rise out of the political graves dug by their Republican 
challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Democrats attributed this modest comeback to the counter-thrust launched 
by the national party against the Republican "contract with America," a 
10-point Reaganesque agenda for cutting taxes, trimming social programs and 
beefing up the military. In a $2-million ad campaign, the Democrats charged 
that the contract boiled down to huge tax cuts for the rich, massive new 
federal budget deficits and deep cuts in Medicare and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We blunted it and destroyed its credibility," Coelho said. But Republicans 
contend that all the Democratic attention paid to the contract helped them 
carry out their strategy of nationalizing the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts suggest that Clinton deserves some credit for the improvement 
the Democrats have been able to make in their condition. He hit the campaign 
trail, hoping to use the prestige he gained from his recent foreign policy 
successes to energize loyal Democrats -- whose apathy about this election, 
party strategists fear, may keep them from the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "He revved up the troops here just as he revved up the troops in Kuwait," said 
Pat Ewing, campaign manager for Sen. Harris Wofford (D-Pa.), who is battling an 
aggressive Republican challenger. 
</P>
<P>
 But Republicans scoffed at the idea that Clinton, whom they have made a prime 
target of their own campaigns, could aid any of his party's beleaguered 
candidates. "In Ohio and Pennsylvania, our polls showed he didn't move the 
races at all," said Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour. "And 
when he says: 'We've got to keep going in the direction we've been going,' he 
is telling people just what they don't want to hear." 
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts attributed the Democratic comeback to the inherent advantages 
of incumbency, particularly money. A recent Common Cause analysis showed that 
through Sept. 30, House members had raised five times as much money as their 
opponents. "The sheer weight of money wears down challengers," McInturff said. 
</P>
<P>
 These and other factors will help determine the outcome of scores of close 
races around the country. Here is a brief look at some of the major contests at 
the national and state level: The Senate 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats started off with huge numerical disadvantages. Of the 35 seats 
being contested, 22 are held by Democrats, compared with only 13 by 
Republicans. And six of the Democratic seats are open because of retirement, 
compared with only three Republican open seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans claim to be reasonably certain of winning all six of the 
Democratic open seats -- in Michigan, Oklahoma, Arizona, Tennessee, Maine and 
Ohio. That means they would need to gain only one more seat to obtain a 
majority. And they believe that they can do that by toppling at least one of 
three particularly vulnerable Democratic incumbents: Wofford in Pennsylvania, 
who faces Rep. Rick Santorum; Jim Sasser in Tennessee, who is up against 
political newcomer Bill Frist, a surgeon, and Charles S. Robb in Virginia, who 
is competing against Iran-Contra figure Oliver L. North. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans consider three other Democratic Senate incumbents to be only a bit 
less vulnerable. New Jersey's Frank R. Lautenberg is being hammered because of 
a last-minute negative ad charging that his Republican foe, Chuck Haytaian, has 
"racist" support. And California's Feinstein has been fighting hard against her 
Republican challenger, Rep. Mike Huffington (D-Santa Barbara). In New Mexico, 
Republicans cite late polls that indicate Jeff Bingaman is losing ground to GOP 
challenger Colin R. McMillan. 
</P>
<P>
 To hold the Senate, the Democrats probably need to win at least one or two 
Republican seats. Their best chance may be in Minnesota, where Ann Wynia, a 
former legislator, is in a close contest with Republican Rod Grams. They also 
claim to have hopes of unseating Republican incumbents in Washington, where 
Seattle City Councilman Ron Sims is challenging Sen. Slade Gorton; and in 
Vermont, where state Sen. Jan Backus has been gaining ground on Republican Sen. 
James M. Jeffords. The House 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, political arithmetic helps explain why the Democrats are in 
trouble. Not only do they have more seats to lose, but of the 52 open seats 
resulting from retirements and members seeking other offices, 31 are held by 
Democrats, compared with only 21 for Republicans. What's more, a poll by the 
Times Mirror Center for the People & the Press, based on interviews with nearly 
1,500 registered voters last Thursday through Saturday, suggests that 
Republican House candidates would get 52% of the popular vote to 48% for 
Democrats, which would translate into a hefty Republican gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, only one prominent Republican -- New York Rep. Bill Paxon, chairman of 
the House GOP campaign committee -- is publicly predicting that the party will 
win the 40 or more seats needed to gain control. His forecast is based on polls 
that show Republicans are leading or are within the poll's margin of error 
against 37 Democratic incumbents and in 20 open-seat races. Among the 
incumbents on Paxon's endangered list, and nearly everyone else's, is House 
Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington state, struggling to fend off the 
challenge of Republican George Nethercutt. Paxon claims no Republican incumbent 
is behind anywhere in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 But Democrats dispute Paxon's claims and contend that they can score enough 
victories against Republican incumbents and in open-seat districts to hold the 
GOP gain to around 30. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason Democrats are having difficulty in defeating Republican incumbents 
at a time when the anti-incumbent feeling is supposedly high is that "there are 
not many good Democratic challengers," said Mark Gersh, Washington director of 
the National Committee for an Effective Congress, a political action committee 
that supports Democratic candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 And for this, some analysts say, the President is partly to blame. Governors 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats are also losing the numbers game here. Of the 36 governorships 
up for grabs, 21 are now held by Democrats, 14 by Republicans and one, 
Connecticut, by an independent. The Democratic outlook in the big states has 
been brightened by the recent gains of New York's Cuomo against GOP lawmaker 
George Pataki, Texas Gov. Ann Richards against former President George Bush's 
son George W. Bush, and Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles against another Bush son, 
Jeb. But in all these races, the outcome remains in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Another big state in which Democrats have reason for concern is Pennsylvania, 
where Lt. Gov. Mark Singel is neck and neck with his Republican challenger, 
Rep. Tom Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats say their best chances for taking governorships away from 
Republicans are in Iowa and Maine. Party Shifts 
</P>
<P>
 The party controlling the White House has lost ground in every midterm 
election since 1934. In the last 40 years, losses in the House during elections 
falling in the middle of a President's first term have ranged from a low of 
four seats in 1962 to a high of 26 in 1982. In the Senate, the changes have 
ranged from a pickup of four seats in 1962 to a loss of 3 in 1978.

U.S. ADVISES LIE TESTS FOR PARENTS OF MISSING KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police departments investigating reports of missing or abducted children 
should assume foul play and quickly ask parents to submit to polygraph tests, 
according to a new Justice Department report. 
</P>
<P>
 Advance copies of the 220-page manual, billed as a guide to case investigation 
and program management, were used by law enforcement agencies investigating the 
South Carolina case of Susan Smith, who reported the abduction of her two sons 
Oct. 25 but was charged with their murder last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Laney, director of the Justice Department's programs on missing and 
exploited children, called police handling of that case "a model response" and 
noted that federal investigators assisting local police departments followed 
the guide very closely. 
</P>
<P>
 The manual, which stresses the need to act quickly when children disappear, 
also recommends that law enforcement agencies broadcast reports of missing 
children over all police frequencies and that they file missing children 
reports immediately with the FBI's National Crime Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Laney said the manual, with a checklist to help investigators avoid 
overlooking any possibilities, should be of particular help to small police 
departments that have little experience or training in dealing with missing or 
abducted children. He added that it will address a glaring problem in the 
investigation of many missing-child cases: inconsistency in the way many police 
departments pursue such reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department, which commissioned the private National Center for 
Missing and Exploited Children to develop the manual, is mailing copies to 
17,000 law enforcement agencies this week. Each year, 3,200 to 4,600 children 
are abducted by non-family members, and 495,000 children run away, are 
abandoned, are abducted by family members or are otherwise lost, injured or 
missing, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
 The manual's recommendation that polygraphs be used to interview parents is 
expected to add to the controversy surrounding the so-called lie-detector 
tests. The South Carolina case, however, may bolster the argument for 
suspecting parents. Smith was given polygraph tests Oct. 27 and last Tuesday 
and, according to published reports, she failed both. 
</P>
<P>
 While conceding the disagreement over the validity of polygraph tests, the 
manual recommends using the tests early in the investigation, when suspects or 
parents may not sense an "accusatory purpose." Early polygraph tests also allow 
investigators to address derogatory information about the family quickly, the 
manual says. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Laney said the early use of a lie detector could help 
investigators rule out parental involvement quickly and allow them to focus on 
more promising avenues of pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the early and consistent use of lie-detector tests may help 
investigators sort through parents' reactions to the disappearance of a child, 
the manual suggests. There is no way to predict how parents will respond, the 
manual warns, and police should not assume that seemingly "inappropriate" 
behavior indicates parental involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Another recent case prompted the experts who drafted the manual to instruct 
investigators "always (to) search the home, even if the child is missing from 
another location." Such searches may turn up clues to the disappearance or even 
the missing children themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 That recommendation stems from a Florida case in which Pauline Zile told 
authorities that her daughter, Christina, 7, was abducted from a Ft. Lauderdale 
flea market restroom Oct. 22. Her husband, the child's stepfather, was charged 
with Christina's murder Oct. 27; Pauline Zile was charged Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had found blood on the floors and walls of their apartment and in the 
trunk of their car before Zile's husband led them to the child's remains buried 
north of West Palm Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The manual also cited another well-known child-abduction case, that of Polly 
Klaas, to support recommendations that investigators quickly disseminate 
information about missing children across all police frequencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Just 90 minutes after Polly's abduction from her Petaluma home, sheriff's 
deputies questioned Richard Allen Davis, whose car was stuck in a ditch. Davis 
said he was sightseeing, and the police left. He was later charged with the 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies did not detain Davis for further questioning because they were 
unaware of the kidnaping, which had been reported on a radio frequency that 
they had not been monitoring.

PRESIDENT'S AIDES SEEK NEW STRATEGIES FOR NEXT 2 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For two years, President Clinton asked voters to judge him by his ability to 
move legislation through Congress. His pollster, Stanley B. Greenberg, even 
developed a hypothesis that the ability to master Congress might be for 
presidents in the post-Cold War period the kind of litmus test of strength that 
mastering the Soviets was for presidents from Harry S. Truman through Ronald 
Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with Clinton's legislative record swathed in bandages and Republicans 
poised to gain a substantial number of seats in the House and Senate on 
Tuesday, his aides concede that they must either develop a new definition of 
success or accept a verdict of failure. 
</P>
<P>
 For several weeks, meeting as much as possible out of the public eye, groups 
of top Clinton advisers have been debating the themes and initiatives they 
should focus on in the next two years. While the President and his aides are 
not expected to make many decisions before Thanksgiving, the major options are 
already clear. 
</P>
<P>
 As has been true throughout his term, Clinton faces a choice -- and a division 
among his advisers -- between an "inside" path and an "outside" one. 
</P>
<P>
 While he ran for the presidency as an outsider -- repeatedly reminding voters 
that he had been a governor, not part of the "Washington crowd" -- Clinton in 
office deliberately followed an insider strategy. The President and his aides, 
many of whom had served apprenticeships on Capitol Hill, were fixed on avoiding 
the fate of the previous Democratic President, Jimmy Carter, who badly 
alienated congressional Democrats and suffered accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to get legislation passed, Clinton tied himself to his party's 
congressional leadership, tailoring his proposals ahead of time to avoid 
conflicts with committee and subcommittee chairmen, often at the expense of 
presenting clear, uncomplicated proposals to the public at large. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy succeeded for the President's budget plan last year -- a crucial 
piece of legislation that all Republican members of Congress announced long in 
advance they would oppose. But this year, tying Clinton's fortunes to 
congressional Democrats became a major problem, yielding neither public esteem 
nor success on the President's major initiative: health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, about to face a new Congress almost certain to be far more hostile to his 
proposals, at least some Clinton advisers believe the President has an 
opportunity to stop worrying about passing legislation and, instead, to look 
for bold, high-profile initiatives that can give Americans a clear idea of what 
he is willing to fight for. That way, they argue, he might recapture the mantle 
of "change" that slipped from his shoulders during months of legislative 
haggling. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, argue that despite widespread cynicism about government, the 
public still expects Congress and the President to get things done. The 
President must at least try to find ways of working within the system in 
Congress and pass legislation -- even if the Republicans gain control, this 
group contends. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to begin with the premise that a President and a Congress have to 
work together," White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta said in a recent 
interview. "I've never seen an issue that can't be worked through if there's 
good faith" on both sides, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton aides point to next month's scheduled vote on the world trade 
agreement, followed by tests early next year on welfare and political reform, 
as the areas that will indicate what the legislative climate will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans have promised that if they gain power in Congress, they will pass 
reforms of lobbying laws, campaign finances and the welfare system -- all areas 
in which Clinton has made proposals. In theory, the two parties could agree on 
compromises that would allow reform legislation to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 In practice, however, many White House aides say they doubt that the 
Republicans really will allow anything to pass, fearing Clinton will be able to 
claim credit for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Panetta, after making the case for bipartisan accommodation, said he was 
"skeptical" that Republican leaders -- particularly Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) 
-- would actually agree to work with Clinton. "Once you get a taste of this 
sort of confrontation, sometimes it goes to your head," he said, referring to 
the anti-Clinton campaign tactics that Gingrich has pushed. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Republicans say: " 'To hell with you, we're not going to work with 
you,' then clearly we're looking at confrontational politics," Panetta said. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, aides say, Clinton faces two major alternative strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 One would be to imitate Truman, who proposed policies he favored, watched 
while Republican legislators killed them, and then focused his 1948 
presidential campaign into an attack on the "do-nothing Congress." Already, 
Clinton advisers have begun honing their lines for such a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the President is sincerely working for change, and they're blocking it, 
that will move the public," said George Stephanopoulos, senior adviser to the 
President. "If they gain a lot of seats, the Republicans are going to have to 
take responsibility for governing." 
</P>
<P>
 The downside of that strategy, aides concede, is that it would only work if 
the Republicans truly capture control of both houses. A Republican gain large 
enough to give the party de facto control would still leave Democrats nominally 
in charge, making a strategy of running against Congress futile for a 
Democratic President. Even if the Republicans do win control, the Truman 
strategy has been hard to duplicate -- George Bush, for example, tried it with 
little success. 
</P>
<P>
 The other alternative would be for Clinton to attempt to minimize the 
Republicans' advantage as much as possible by declining to engage Congress -- 
concentrating instead on areas in which he can act alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "As President, he has many more stages on which to operate" than just the 
legislative one, Greenberg said. Other aides, amplifying that point, argue that 
Clinton may discover, as most of his predecessors have, that a combination of 
high-profile foreign policy actions and executive branch actions that do not 
require new legislation can yield more benefits than endless wrangling with 
congressional committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton advisers say the choice between those two paths depends, in part, on 
what one believes will best motivate the electorate's all-important swing 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the roller-coaster nature of Clinton's approval ratings in the past 20 
months, neither his core support nor his core opposition has changed much, 
notes Republican pollster William McInturff. Clinton has remained popular with 
those who voted for him in 1992 -- although many are disappointed that he has 
not been able to accomplish more. And from Day One he has been reviled by the 
vast majority of those who voted for Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 The ups and downs have come almost exclusively from the vacillating 
perceptions of the swing voters -- the mostly white, primarily male, 
predominantly lower-income voters who sided in large numbers with independent 
presidential candidate Ross Perot in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 One school of thought is that those voters truly are motivated by anger at the 
political system itself and that they deeply want to see the system reformed. 
If that is the case, then a strong presidential effort for measures like 
campaign-finance reform and lobbying reform might be the best way to win over 
the people whose support Clinton will need to win reelection in 1996. That 
would require pushing new legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 A second school of thought is that while the swing voters may say they are 
angry at the political system or at the federal deficit or, generally, at the 
"mess in Washington," the real cause of their upset is 20 years of stagnant 
living standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Although swing voters are found at every level of income and education, polls 
indicate that the bulk of those who have veered in the past two years from 
tolerance of Clinton to anger at him are lower-income men without a college 
degree -- precisely the people who have suffered the greatest relative decline 
in living standards during the past two decades of slow income growth. The best 
way of cementing their allegiance is, simply, to raise wages, some Clinton 
aides argue. 
</P>
<P>
 If that is the case, then new legislation -- with the possible exception of 
job-training measures -- will do little to win over these voters. But the good 
news for Clinton, advocates of this point of view argue, is that the economic 
policies already in place, combined with the natural workings of the economic 
recovery, should bring about rising wages during the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some statistical measures suggest that wage increases already have 
begun. So while the improving economy has not benefited Clinton in this 
election year, it may do so during the next two years as the fruits of the 
recovery become more real to people. In the meantime, some advisers argue, the 
best strategy for Clinton may be to avoid debilitating legislative fights while 
taking other actions that make him seem more "presidential." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton aides already have begun taking steps in that direction. The White 
House has started planning for a heavy foreign travel schedule in 1995, 
including a likely trip to South Africa -- the first ever by a U.S. President 
-- plus a summit in Moscow with Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin, a 50th 
anniversary celebration of the end of World War II in Europe in the spring and 
economic summits in both Europe and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also are hopeful that U.S. efforts to broker a deal between Israel 
and Syria may bear fruit next year, allowing Clinton to preside over a third 
Mideast peace ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 On the domestic side, Clinton can push his "reinventing government" efforts -- 
looking for ways to dramatize the idea that he is reducing the size of the 
government. He can also take administrative actions to remind Americans of 
legislation that Congress did pass but that polls indicate most people know 
nothing about. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of what you want to do is make sure you take the bills" that did pass in 
the last two years and "turn good laws into good policies that make a change in 
people's lives," Stephanopoulos said. As the Family Leave Act, the expanded 
earned-income tax credit, the national service plan and student-loan reform 
begin to take effect, Stephanopoulos said, they will become "more real" to 
people and be of much greater political benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton addressed that issue in a recent interview with the Black 
Entertainment Television cable channel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most Americans do not know, unless they've been personally affected by the 
college loan program, the family leave program, the immunization program," he 
said. "We just have to work harder to get those messages out. And next year, 
I'm going to devote an enormous amount of time to doing it."

RIVALS FOR SENATE, GOVERNOR BATTLE ACROSS STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Campaigning across the length of California, the four major candidates for 
U.S. Senate and governor readied their final pitches to California voters 
Sunday, each of them expressing a politician's confidence in his or her own 
chances for election 48 hours hence. 
</P>
<P>
 Gubernatorial candidates Kathleen Brown and Pete Wilson continued their angry 
back-and-forth about illegal immigration, Proposition 187 and crime, issues 
that have dominated their campaign in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should be dead. I oppose the death penalty. I'm Jerry Brown's sister. I am 
a woman. I'm running against an incumbent. I'm being outspent by 3 to 1, and I 
have (opposed) an initiative that was going to win by 66% of the vote up until 
two weeks ago and even now it's on the edge," an upbeat Brown told reporters. 
"I should be dead. I don't feel dead for some reason. I feel really great, so 
we'll see." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was equally confident, telling GOP volunteers in Monrovia that they 
should not be swayed by his lead in the polls but should work hard until 
Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Run up the score," he told them. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate candidates Dianne Feinstein, the incumbent Democrat, and Republican 
U.S. Rep. Mike Huffington kept a somewhat slower pace but the heat of their 
rhetoric was nonetheless intense. Feinstein reminded voters of her work on the 
federal crime bill and the ban on military assault rifles; Huffington spoke in 
favor of the initiative on the California ballot that would imprison for 25 
years to life those who commit three felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, in Monrovia, called Feinstein and U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer the 
"Thelma and Louise" of politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you remember what happened at the end of the movie," he said, alluding to 
the characters' demise off the end of a cliff. "We're going to send Dianne 
Feinstein home in two days to the city by the bay." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Feinstein was more confident than she has been in recent weeks 
and exhorted her followers to work hard through Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we let these races be bought, if we let these people who have huge amounts 
of money go on and run slanderous ads and you can't do anything about it . . . 
the American political process will be rent asunder," Feinstein said in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, whose campaign aides said they were convinced that the treasurer is 
making up ground, campaigned vigorously, her speeches firm and feisty despite a 
weekend spent explaining her campaign's financial troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 She made campaign stops in San Diego, Sacramento and in Los Angeles, where 
Brown spoke at a rally against Proposition 187, which would deny public 
education and non-emergency state services to illegal immigrants. She said the 
election presented a distinction between "politicians who use issues just to 
hold onto power and politicians who use power to address the issues of the 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown characterized Wilson as one who "would use our fears and our anger and 
our frustration just to hold onto power." 
</P>
<P>
 "It has happened before," she said to a standing ovation at the West Los 
Angeles United Methodist Church. "We must not let it happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to reporters later, Brown dismissed the open worries of many 
Democrats that her campaign's decision to air virtually no television 
advertisements on the final weekend before the election would be harmful to her 
and other party candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown aides said Saturday that they were unable to air ads this weekend 
because they had essentially run out of money last week. They still planned to 
run two anti-Wilson immigration ads beginning today. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said she had decided instead to put her campaign money into a field 
operation that could persuade voters to turn out on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she felt that her staff had mismanaged the finances -- as White House 
officials had grumbled Saturday during the President's visit to California -- 
she said, "I think you evaluate all of that afterward." 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown defended her campaign against accusations that it had violated the 
first rule of financing -- make sure there is money for the end of the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's also been a rule of politics for the last decade and a half that you 
don't put one dime into the field," she said. "It's a rule of politics that you 
spend it all on TV. I have not done that. I have been unconventional in a whole 
variety of ways in this campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson spent the day with other GOP candidates at a series of events that 
exuded Americana, from the huge American flag and Marine Corps hymn that 
greeted him in Riverside to the Little Leaguers with caramel popcorn and hot 
dogs in Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Riverside VFW post, Wilson took credit for building the state's second 
veterans' home in Barstow and for making the Department of Veteran Affairs a 
Cabinet-level agency. He criticized the Clinton Administration for cutting 
military spending and wove that together with a subject that has drawn his 
focus all year: crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans, he said, "fought for a California that would be free and full of 
opportunity, and not one where men and women who are decent have to live behind 
bars or in gated communities to ensure their own safety." 
</P>
<P>
 He also pleaded with voters to pass Proposition 187.

<P>
 "We will not shortchange the education of legal residents, the health care of 
legal residents, or the opportunity of legal residents in order to reward those 
who violated the law by crossing the border and entering this country 
illegally," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Monrovia rally in favor of the "three strikes" proposition, Wilson 
exhorted voters to pass that measure and dismissed suggestions that it might 
lock up felons who are not truly dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are incurable, incorrigible repeat offenders," Wilson said of the 
measure's targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein spent the final Sunday of her campaign at a union hall in San Luis 
Obispo and before supporters in Pasadena, where she talked about the ban she 
authored on military assault rifles. She said illegal immigration and campaign 
finance reform would be her top priorities if she wins a full term in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 With an eye toward the $28 million of his own money that Huffington has 
already spent on his own behalf, Feinstein said her reforms would include 
meaningful spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
 As she has many times before, Feinstein used the Pasadena event to tout her 
bipartisan support and was joined by the city's Republican vice mayor, Bill 
Paparian. He announced not only his support but Feinstein's endorsement by the 
Armenian National Committee, a politically conservative group that is 
supporting Wilson and carries some sway with the state's 500,000 Armenians. 
</P>
<P>
 "This race is, in fact, much more about our nation than it is about 
Republicans and Democrats. It is much more about people than it is about 
partisanship," Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 About her own chances, Feinstein was pleased but somewhat subdued about a new 
poll that showed her pulling away from her challenger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very good about it," she said, "but the only poll that matters is the 
poll on Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, meanwhile, appeared at two events with Wilson and other GOP 
candidates. At one, the rally for the "three strikes" initiative, he brought up 
the recent deaths of two South Carolina boys, allegedly at the hands of their 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was disgusted," he said. "I cried. I was racked with pain. Our society is 
too lenient. We have too many liberals saying it's our fault, it's society's 
fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, it's not. It's the criminals' fault. Let's elect a senator to the United 
States Senate who is going to appoint the toughest judges available." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington continued to accuse Feinstein and the Clinton Administration of a 
cover-up -- denied by those parties -- of Immigration and Naturalization 
Service documents relating to the senator's employment of a Guatemalan woman 
whose work papers expired while she was employed by Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an election about character," he said at the Orange County 
Fairgrounds. "Character you cannot buy, you are either born with it and learn 
it or you do not have it." 
</P>

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / INSURANCE COMMISSIONER; TORRES VOWS FREEZE OF INSURANCE 
RATES; OPPONENT RIDICULES PLEDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Sen. Art Torres, the Democratic candidate for insurance commissioner, 
promised Sunday a one-year freeze on all insurance rates over which he would 
have jurisdiction if the voters elect him Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Assemblyman Charles Quackenbush, the Republican candidate, 
called the Torres pledge an "arbitrary promise" by "a desperate candidate" and 
said not enough is known about the insurance price situation in the state to 
make such a pledge. Some companies, she suggested, might even be prevented from 
lowering prices by such a pledge. 
</P>
<P>
 At least $60 billion in insurance premiums -- in such lines as automobile, 
homeowners, earthquake, commercial liability and workers' comp -- are under the 
rate-setting authority of the insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 The Torres promise came against a background of heavy television advertising 
by Quackenbush, mostly financed by insurance industry contributions, and some 
tracking polls suggesting that the Republican has a lead in the final days of 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
 In a new television ad aired widely over the weekend, Quackenbush ignored his 
own contributions from the industry, which now total close to $2 million, and 
accused Torres of taking more than $200,000 from the industry, after saying he 
wouldn't take anything. 
</P>
<P>
 One distinction between the industry contributions to the two sides, beyond 
the divergent amounts, is that Quackenbush has received the lion's share of his 
industry contributions from companies, agents and brokers who are directly 
regulated by the insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Torres contributions came from lawyers who work on industry 
issues, but are not directly regulated by the commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Torres backers, consumer advocate Ralph Nader and Harvey Rosenfield, said 
Sunday that if Quackenbush tried to raise rates, consumer interests would sue 
to prevent it. They estimated that under Quackenbush, average auto insurance 
rates would rise $96 in the first year, or a total of $1.35 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush spokeswoman Lynne Andersen said there are no facts available to 
reach such a conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres said he is basing his promise of a rate freeze on his belief that many 
insurers have been realizing excessive profits because they have never extended 
the rate benefits foreseen by Proposition 103, passed by the electorate in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I will freeze the rates," Torres said. And, he added, when he establishes 
a formula for rate-making based on insurer revenues, the prices may go lower 
still. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be very difficult for Quackenbush to do, given the industry 
contributions he's received," Torres said. "They're not giving him all this 
money because he has a nice smile." 
</P>
<P>
 Responding for Quackenbush, Andersen said, "Torres has obviously come up with 
this last promise without doing any statistical analysis as to what will be 
good for the consumers and what isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consumers have had enough false promises concerning Proposition 103," she 
added. "Chuck Quackenbush will get in there and get the job done without phony 
predictions." 
</P>
<P>
 Nader declared Sunday that if Quackenbush is elected, he foresees a revival of 
the adverse relationship between the commissioner's office and the leading 
consumer groups that existed before 1990, when Republican Roxani Gillespie was 
the last appointed commissioner, before the election of Democrat John 
Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then the consumers would have to sue to enforce the laws," Nader said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nader acknowledged, however, that he is not certain what policies Quackenbush 
would follow as commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy would have torn loyalties," Nader said. "He wouldn't want to be the 
most unpopular figure in the state. On the other hand, he would know who paid 
to put him in office." 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush declared last week that regardless of his contributions from the 
industry, he would be an independent commissioner, speaking up for prompt 
payment of consumer claims when he considered them legitimate and "cracking 
down hard on company abuses." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know all these companies aren't angels," he said.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / 4TH SENATE DISTRICT; PROP. 187 SERVING AS BACKDROP IN 
YET ANOTHER RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the dusty farmlands of the Sacramento Valley, a Republican state legislator 
is campaigning as hard against illegal immigrants as he is against his 
Democratic opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an ironic twist to an ugly race, freshman Sen. K. Maurice Johannessen 
of Redding finds his own legal status under fire from Democratic challenger 
Mike McGowan of West Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not the one who entered this country illegally, you are," McGowan, 47, 
charges in a television spot directed at Johannessen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not an illegal alien," insists Johannessen, 60, who nevertheless has 
said he "jumped ship" at San Pedro in 1952 as a 17-year-old merchant seaman 
from Norway. He says he was detained, deported briefly to Mexico, returned to 
California and became a naturalized citizen while in the Army. 
</P>
<P>
 "At no time was I illegal," Johannessen said in an interview last week. "There 
was nothing illegal. Now (the McGowan campaign) is saying I want to stop 
everybody else from coming in. Horse manure." 
</P>
<P>
 One Johannessen commercial depicts the purported takeover of a meeting of an 
unnamed California city council by a mob of "illegal alien activists" whose 
shouts drown out the pledge to the flag. "So, Mr. McGowan, whose side are you 
on?" the announcer asks. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome in the 4th Senate District, stretching from the northeastern edge 
of San Francisco Bay to the Oregon line, is one of a handful of races that 
could determine whether Democrats keep their narrow control of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Democrats in the mostly blue-collar agricultural district outnumber 
Republicans, 47.7% to 38.5%, the region historically has been conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 Johannessen, a bedrock conservative and wealthy real estate developer, is 
seeking a full four-year term in a reapportioned district that is mostly new 
territory for him. He first took office seven months ago after a special 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, protecting water against export to the south is the most 
visceral political issue in the rural north. But immigration has overwhelmed 
water in this campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In speeches, mailers and broadcast advertising, Johannessen deplores what he 
says are waves of Latinos who illegally "come across the border for a free 
lunch" of welfare and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are people that violate the laws of the land," he tells audiences in 
the accent of his native Norway. He asserts that McGowan is backed by 
"liberals" in the Legislature who favor benefits for undocumented immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Johannessen is a strong supporter of the Proposition 187 illegal immigration 
initiative. McGowan also backs the measure, which he says is necessary to 
pressure the federal government into paying the costs of illegal immigration in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 But McGowan, a Yolo County supervisor whose guilty plea on a 1984 drunken 
driving charge has become another campaign issue in recent weeks, claims that 
Johannessen is more than a fervent supporter of Proposition 187. By targeting 
illegal immigration of Latinos, McGowan says, his opponent practices hypocrisy 
and "is plugging into the fears and frustrations of Californians." 
</P>
<P>
 The seeds of controversy over Johannessen's own legal status were planted 
several years ago in a television interview in which he said he "jumped ship" 
at San Pedro to join his immigrant parents in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview, Johannessen said he was jailed, released and deported 
briefly to Mexico. Although unable to speak English, Johannessen said he 
returned to California and joined the Army when he couldn't find a civilian 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got into the service, they did not know I was an alien," he said. He 
said he was asked about his lack of English skills and told officials he came 
from a little village in Minnesota where only Norwegian was spoken. "They 
bought it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he said, the Army helped him obtain citizenship papers, Johannessen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times, however, Johannessen amplified on his arrival 
in California and maintained he was never illegally in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the term "jump ship" was a "common statement" of immigrants of the 
early 1950s and was not meant to imply that his departure was "done illegally." 
</P>
<P>
 Johannessen said he went directly from the freighter to the immigration office 
at the San Pedro dock, where he showed officials his passport. He said he was 
detained overnight as a minor -- but not arrested -- until authorities "called 
my father to pick me up the next morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, he said, he went to Tijuana where he "picked up the 
permanent (U.S. residence) papers. I stepped across the border of Mexico and 
was given the papers." He said he went to Tijuana because U.S. residency 
documents were required to be issued in a foreign land and Mexico was 
convenient for him. 
</P>
<P>
 As for misleading Army authorities by saying he was from a Norwegian town in 
Minnesota, Johannessen said he did so because he was repeatedly asked by 
others, "How come you don't speak English well?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It was driving me bonkers. That was just my way of getting away from (the 
questions). I was 18 years old, a kid basically being harassed. It worked," he 
said.

DEVOTED DOCENTS; NIXON LIBRARY SEES POST-FUNERAL SURGE IN VOLUNTEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 It took Woodward and Bernstein two books and more than 800 pages to sum up 
Watergate. After a special class this month, it takes Battersby and York just 
six words: A break-in. A cover-up. A resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Florence Battersby and Ed York, along with seven other eager students, learned 
this succinct version of history as part of the docent training course at the 
Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace. The orientation prepares these longtime 
admirers of the Yorba Linda native for duty as crowd handlers, watchdogs and 
tour guides at the presidential site. 
</P>
<P>
 With these docent newcomers, the library's volunteers will number an all-time 
high of 131. That's way up from the average of 80. Docent leaders attribute the 
latest membership surge to the former President's funeral in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw Richard Nixon's funeral on television, it tugged at my 
heartstrings," said Battersby, 69, echoing a sentiment common among the new 
crop of library volunteers. "I thought, 'Wouldn't it be wonderful to be part of 
that history?' " 
</P>
<P>
 But a mere whim will not transform volunteers into successful docents, whose 
ages range from 22 to 80, trainers say. It requires commitment, a good memory 
and the ability to stay on your feet for three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kind of people that volunteer here are high-powered," said Renee 
Wildenberg, 50, who has been a docent since 1990. "They have lots of energy and 
aren't the kind who sit around being couch potatoes." 
</P>
<P>
 As the students waded through streams of Nixon facts and protocol at a one-day 
seminar in mid-October, the library's basement took on the atmosphere of a 
demanding high school course. 
</P>
<P>
 First, there was the reading list -- close to 2,000 pages, including the 
expansive presidential memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like 'War and Peace,' " remarked York, 64, a former engineer with 
the Department of Defense, referring to the 1,000-plus-page Nixon tome. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to read it in two days," joked Wildenberg, a Yorba Linda resident. 
</P>
<P>
 No laughing matter to the new docents, however, is that they will soon be 
expected to draw confidently upon facts culled from their readings and other 
library exhibits. For example, the new docents discovered they would have to 
know tidbits such as the births, marriages and deaths of four generations of 
Nixons and Milhouses; that the library's moon rock is as big as the one in the 
Smithsonian Institution, and that Ed Cox proposed to Tricia Nixon in the White 
House's Lincoln Sitting Room. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's mind-boggling to get all this under your belt," said Carolyn Nollette, 
59, of Yorba Linda, who like other beginners received five follow-up training 
sessions with veteran docents before going solo in the library. "There's just 
so much history." 
</P>
<P>
 Next came the rules. Lots of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't refer to the Nixons as "Dick" or "Pat," even if you knew them. Don't 
chew gum on duty. Don't bother VIPs. Don't be a piece of furniture, but don't 
be the main attraction either. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, beware the press, trainers told the group. It's something Nixon himself 
might have said. Docents were instructed to defer media questions to library 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Be aware you may be talking to the press or someone who would like to spread 
a negative opinion using the Docent Guild as a source," the docent manual says. 
</P>
<P>
 And always abide by the dress code. The guild's 26 men and 105 women have 
little trouble deciding what to wear to their three-hour shifts at the library. 
While on duty, the men must wear gray slacks, white shirt, a navy blue jacket 
and a Nixon Library Docent Guild tie. 
</P>
<P>
 The women must stick to white blouses, navy blue skirts, red jackets and the 
Nixon Library Docent Guild scarf. The women are directed to don only natural or 
navy blue nylons, select conservative hair bows, use modest amounts of perfume 
and wear "plain" earrings. 
</P>
<P>
 Straying from the Docent Uniform Standards, which were adopted in September, 
could land volunteers in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ladies, if you wear one earring that plays the 'Battle Hymn of the Republic' 
and the other one plays 'America the Beautiful,' you're going to hear from me," 
charter docent Jo Lyons told the trainees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like an awful lot of do's and don'ts," added Wildenberg. "But they 
are important and a wonderful set of information to refer to." 
</P>
<P>
 The list grew longer this summer. Docents, who already shared fondness for 
volunteerism and the Nixon family, apparently were getting too chummy during 
their shifts. The chattiness prompted a new rule: No socializing on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got to the point where people were left to their own devices and own good 
common sense," said Lyons, a Yorba Linda resident, who has volunteered at the 
library since it opened in July, 1990. "And it just didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 The docents take all this to heart and pay for the privilege. There is a $50 
training fee, and annual dues are $25. The Nixon memoir, a fact book and other 
goods, including the official docent tie or scarf, are included in their docent 
package. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the daylong training session turns to the delicate matter of dealing 
with contentious visitors, who want to argue about Watergate and other 
controversial events of Nixon's long and tumultuous political career. The 
three-sentence synopsis and the library's Watergate display should speak for 
itself, explained the docent trainers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Occasionally, you'll get a guest that will want to challenge you about your 
opinions," said Wildenberg. "It's just human nature. But don't get in an 
argument with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We present the facts, you draw your own conclusions," she added. "Other than 
that, there's not a lot to comment on." 
</P>
<P>
 The library's assistant director, Kevin Cartwright, defended their take on the 
political saga that led to the downfall of the 37th President. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our exhibits are no more skewed than others," Cartwright assured the trainees 
during an early morning tour. "Watergate's a very complicated story to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to explain how all Presidents since FDR had some type of taping 
mechanism in the White House," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The new docents got the message. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've made up my mind, if anybody says anything, that's OK," said Battersby. 
"You don't have to like him (Nixon). 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't argue with them," she added. "I wouldn't want to be rude. I would 
turn and walk away before that." 
</P>
<P>
 That type of non-confrontational attitude would have sat well with the former 
President, say veteran docents, who credit Nixon with paving the way for peace 
in Vietnam and the Middle East, detente with the Soviet Union and reaching out 
to China. While addressing the volunteer group a few years ago, Nixon said he 
wanted visitors to feel at home in his birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 And as Wildenberg put it: "We want them to leave the library with a warm, 
fuzzy feeling. We are not only dispensers of information but also dispensers of 
warmth and comfort as well."

1ST WOMAN TO BE HEAD OF YOSEMITE; ENVIRONMENT: PARK SERVICE PICKS A VETERAN 
ADMINISTRATOR WHO HAS WORKED THERE BEFORE. SHE FACES A HOST OF PROBLEMS, MANY 
ORIGINATING OUTSIDE THE PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in its 104-year history, Yosemite National Park will be run 
by a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Park Service is expected to announce today the appointment of 
Barbara J. (B. J.) Griffin as superintendent, marking the first time a woman 
has been placed in charge of any of the three Western parks, Yosemite, 
Yellowstone and Grand Canyon, regarded as the crown jewels of the Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin, who is 52 and has worked at Yosemite in the past, is a 20-year 
veteran of the Park Service and served most recently as director of the Mid- 
Atlantic Region, which encompasses 30 sites, including the Gettysburg 
battlefield and Shenandoah National Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin was traveling Sunday and could not be reached for comment, according 
to Park Service officials. Park Service Director Roger Kennedy is to personally 
announce the new assignment. The busiest national park, Great Smoky Mountains 
National Park, already is headed by a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin is replacing Michael Finley, who has been appointed superintendent of 
Yellowstone National Park. Finley came to Yosemite in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 A Southerner, born in Louisiana and educated at Mercer University in Georgia, 
Griffin will be presiding over hallowed ground in California. More than a park, 
Yosemite and its High Sierra environs represent the crucible of the modern 
conservation movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin will be in charge of an area the size of Rhode Island with a 
$16-million annual budget and a work force of about 2,500. But Griffin's 
success will depend, to a growing extent, on her ability to influence events 
outside the boundaries of her jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, the threats to the national parks come as much from the outside as 
they do from the inside," said Judy Kunosky, executive director of the Yosemite 
Restoration Trust, a nonprofit citizens watchdog group that follows 
environmental issues at the park. "The superintendent has to be someone who 
understands the value of collaborative relationships with the surrounding 
communities and with groups like us." 
</P>
<P>
 With urban sprawl reaching deeper into the Sierras every year and the impacts 
of industrial society -- acid rain and air pollution in particular -- the fate 
of Yosemite will require political skills that past superintendents did not 
need to have, Kunosky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin will be returning to Yosemite as it struggles to accommodate nearly 4 
million visitors each year, and at the same time attempts to reduce human 
impacts. Griffin will be judged by environmental groups and others on how she 
carries out a complex and controversial plan to restrict traffic, reduce motel 
space and retail operations and move some Park Service operations out of 
Yosemite. 
</P>
<P>
 "She could be the most important superintendent in the history of Yosemite," 
said Bill Alsup, a former board president of the Yosemite Restoration Trust and 
a trustee of the Yosemite Assn. "What is accomplished in the next three to five 
years could well shape what the park looks like for the next 100 years," said 
Alsup, who has worked with Griffin in the past and speaks well of her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she has a strong attachment to Yosemite and understands what needs to 
be done to preserve it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalist groups, such as the Sierra Club, which would like to see cars 
banned from Yosemite Valley, will be watching closely whether Griffin endorses 
a compromise proposal by a Park Service consultant to funnel cars into the west 
end of the valley, where the only parking facility would be located -- a 
proposed 2,000-car lot or garage. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1987 to 1990, Griffin was an assistant superintendent at Yosemite. For 
the next three years, she served as associate director of the Park Service's 
Western Region, which includes Yosemite. 
</P>
<P>
 In that position, she supervised the awarding of the park's $1-billion-plus 
tourist concession contract to Delaware North Companies, a firm with extensive 
experience selling food and beverages at racetracks and baseball stadiums, but 
no experience operating in a national park. 
</P>
<P>
 The process that led to the selection of a firm without park experience was 
criticized by senior members of two congressional committees that oversee 
national parks. However, Delaware North's first years of operations in Yosemite 
passed without incident.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: WINNING THE BATTLE AND LOSING THE WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This is not an election campaign that most of the combatants -- consultants or 
candidates -- will want to tell their mothers or grandchildren about, if 
they're truthful. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, judging by the last few weeks, they'll feel no obligation toward 
the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 What did you do in the 1994 election, grandpa? Ah, er, I was tending bar in a 
bordello then.  
</P>
<P>
 It has been especially ugly this year. Some candidates have had the temerity 
to talk about moral values. But for most, the only value that counts is 
victory. The sole ethic recognized by too many consultants and their clients is 
that the end justifies any legal means. 
</P>
<P>
 Distortions? Lies? They're all part of the blood sport. So what if the public 
becomes even more cynical, grumpy with government and distrustful of democracy? 
There are no boundaries except for the limits of voter gullibility. It's fair 
to whip away at anybody or anything as long as blood flows and there's no 
backlash. 
</P>
<P>
 Some recent TV ads have been more odious than others, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * Rep. Mike Huffington's ad claiming that the "Associated Press now proves 
(Sen. Dianne) Feinstein lied -- flat out lied" about an immigrant housekeeper. 
The flat-out lie is Huffington's ad. The AP never pretended to prove anything; 
it merely distributed an inaccurate story published by striking San Francisco 
newspaper staffers. The story later was corrected, but Huffington's ad was not. 
</P>
<P>
 * Assemblyman Tom Umberg's vicious ad suggesting that Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren 
was partly to blame for the murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas. Umberg's cheap 
shot reasoning is that Lungren's office did not have a fancy database on 
parolees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After $90 million worth of attack ads on television, it is no wonder there's a 
strong dislike for each of the major candidates. This is just their problem for 
now. But it will become society's problem when the winners later try to govern. 
</P>
<P>
 The nasty ads "destroy not only the losers but the winners," notes Susan 
Estrich, a USC law professor who managed Michael Dukakis' 1988 presidential 
race. "Even if (Gov.) Pete Wilson wins, a lot of people are going to think he's 
a scumbag. He'll have no voter mandate. He won't go back into office with 
strong popular support. It will be hard for him to get anything done." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Steven A. Merksamer, who was chief of staff for ex-Gov. George 
Deukmejian, says "the politicians have allowed these elections to get out of 
control. When they spend years bashing each other, saying 'you're a liar and 
corrupt and dishonest,' what's the public going to think? That they're all 
liars and corrupt and dishonest. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's helped to create an extremely angry electorate. This feeds on itself. 
Negative ads is too charitable a way to describe it. It's just gutter 
politics." 
</P>
<P>
 To the active political pro, such criticism seems unrealistic and 
Pollyannaish. No election ever was won with a clean campaigning seal, they'll 
tell you. Voters buy the dirt. They aren't moved by positive ads. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be inspiring, however, to watch some major candidate spurn the 
negative and stick to the positive, discussing real problems and telling voters 
honestly where they stand. A candidate of genuine principle who placed virtue 
above victory. Somebody who wanted to look the grandkids in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
 It's conceivable the pros are wrong. The voters might even warm up to such a 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But enough of this. Now is when the voters get to take back the political 
process from the politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 They should channel surf past the TV air wars and junk all partisan political 
mail. If people can chuck that trash -- and focus on the official ballot 
pamphlet, impartial election guides and their own gut instincts -- they'll find 
significant differences between candidates and watershed decisions to be made 
on landmark ballot measures. 
</P>
<P>
 One might not realize it from her campaign -- which mostly has been 
uninspiring -- but as governor, Treasurer Kathleen Brown would be better for 
education and the environment than Wilson. The incumbent, however, would be 
closer to business and less apt to raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The contrast could not be sharper between Feinstein and Huffington. Feinstein 
believes in government and delivering for her state; Huffington detests 
government and preaches volunteerism. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, the most polarizing initiative in three decades, has many 
voters in a quandary. These are not bigots, but citizens who understand that 
illegal immigration is just that -- illegal -- and object to their tax dollars 
being spent on people who don't play by the rules. Still, they worry about 
children and social consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, this has been one of the most exciting California elections in years. 
That's partly because of the blood and bunk. But it's also because races are 
tight and so much is at stake. People will really have to be angry not to vote.

GREENPEACE REPORTS NEW RUSSIAN OIL SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new rupture in a 31-mile pipeline has spilled nearly 4 million gallons of 
oil in Russia's far north just miles from the site of a huge spill this fall, 
an environmental group said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenpeace Russia said it discovered the new spill 40 miles north of the oil 
town of Usinsk on Friday.A duty officer at the Russian Ministry for Emergency 
Situations said the ministry had no information on any new spill. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenpeace Russia said the oil had been set ablaze and that a mile-long stream 
of burning oil fed by lakes of oil two feet deep cut across the tundra. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a major oil disaster," the group's Paul Horsman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The earlier spill, also north of Usinsk and about 1,000 miles northeast of 
Moscow, resulted from a series of ruptures along the pipeline over the past few 
months.

WASHINGTON OUTLOOK: CLINTON FACES COLD REALITIES OF PARTISANSHIP AND ISOLATION; 
THE PRESIDENT TALKS OF FEELING OUT OF STEP WITH THE ELECTORATE AND OUT OF 
PATIENCE WITH THE GOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ronald Brownstein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost two years into his presidency, on the eve of an election that is likely 
to produce a cold slap of repudiation, Bill Clinton says only two things about 
Washington have surprised him. 
</P>
<P>
 One sounds like a campaign talking point: "The intense partisanship of the 
congressional Republican leadership . . . and the fact that they haven't been 
punished for it in public perception," he said in an extended interview Sunday 
morning, stretching out his feet and sipping coffee in the presidential 
limousine as the San Francisco skyline receded into the fog behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 The other sounds more heartfelt, almost plaintive: He has also been surprised, 
he said, "by the difficulty of staying in some harmony with the voters. You are 
so far away from folks, and it is so easy in this environment, when they are 
just being bombarded with (negative) stuff, for them to feel like they are out 
of touch with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly as Election Day finally approaches, millions of Americans feel out of 
harmony with Clinton. Surveying the electorate late last month, U.S. News & 
World Report concluded that about a fifth of the country so strongly 
disapproves of him that the attitude could be fairly summarized as hate. Around 
the country, it is common to find voters who say they believe that he has 
swerved to the left in office and that he deceived them in 1992 when he 
promised to be "a different kind of Democrat." 
</P>
<P>
 All of this resounds with a bitter irony that history may appreciate more than 
Clinton and his allies. The heart of the "New Democrat" message that Clinton 
rode to the White House was to bring Americans together around "third-way" 
ideas that surmounted the ideological polarization of the past quarter of a 
century. Instead, Clinton has proved to be the most polarizing President since 
at least Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton allows that missteps by his Administration have contributed to the 
intensely antagonistic atmosphere shaping this midterm election. "I agree that 
the gays-in-the-military thing contributed to it," he said. "You know, maybe 
(Surgeon General Joycelyn) Elders' statements about (legalizing) drugs 
contributed to it. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 But he is defiant that, for the most part, he has fulfilled his promise to 
chart a centrist course. "By any rational basis, we were able to move the party 
to the center. If I were a Republican President who had cut the deficit more 
than anybody in history, reduced the government to its smallest size since 
(President John F.) Kennedy, passed the toughest crime bill in memory and 
gotten the economy going again, people would say that's an amazing record." 
</P>
<P>
 Why then has the country divided so profoundly about him? He points the finger 
across the aisle, at Republicans like House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.), who recently declared Clinton and his Administration "the enemy of 
normal Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republicans were very successful in trying to oppose everything and not 
being held accountable for being negative on everything, and they and other 
(conservative) forces did a pretty good job of keeping the country divided up," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, he maintained, echoing his longstanding charge, Republicans 
and conservatives have worked to stir up questions about his personal life and 
record in Arkansas "to try to undermine my personal authority. . . ." And all 
of this, he said, gets amplified in a mainstream media environment "that 
focus(es) on conflict and process and the points of division, rather than on 
points of unity" and a feral talk-radio culture whose "primary purpose is to 
wound, not to enlighten." 
</P>
<P>
 Listening to Clinton's version of how his presidency has become a war zone, 
it's easy to understand the passion in his attacks this past week on the GOP. 
In fact, some see Clinton's campaign trail vitriol as nothing more than a man 
who has been hit with a baseball bat now picking up a tire iron (though his 
claims that the GOP intends to cut Social Security are as indefensible as the 
willful Republican mischaracterizations of the crime bill). And as a short-term 
political strategy, Clinton's attacks on the GOP may be the only way to 
motivate Democratic partisans who now appear too dispirited to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 If Republicans make the gains that now seem likely, Clinton could spend the 
next two years delivering more of those speeches. That's the Harry S. Truman 
strategy: castigating a do-nothing GOP Congress for blocking progress. 
</P>
<P>
 In the depth of his bitterness toward the GOP leadership, Clinton seems 
emotionally drawn to that option, and its difficult to believe that he will 
entirely forswear it over the next two years. But at some level he also 
understands that living at DefCon 1 may be both a political dead end and a 
betrayal of the bridge-building he promised the American people in his 1992 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "People felt good about what we did on the North American Free Trade Agreement 
in the end, even people who weren't for us, because it was a genuine bipartisan 
effort," he said. "People felt good on what we did on national service and Head 
Start and even the family and medical leave law because there were some 
Republicans for it and there was a sense that we were trying to move ahead and 
define things that would bring us together." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the prospect of a Congress that under any circumstances will be 
more conservative and Republican, Clinton is already looking for new ways to 
move ahead. One is to reach out on issues like welfare reform to moderate 
Republicans who have already expressed discomfort with the hard lines in the 
GOP's "contract with America." 
</P>
<P>
 Another, he said, is to focus less of his energy on passing new legislation 
and more on aspects of the presidency where he can operate relatively 
independent of Congress. One arena is foreign policy -- particularly the 
trade-liberalizing measures that will be considered at the APEC (Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation) conference in Indonesia later this month and the Summit 
of the Americas in Miami in December. Another is creatively implementing 
initiatives that Congress has already passed, such as the crime bill and urban 
empowerment zones (which he said he would like to expand beyond the nine 
Congress has already approved). 
</P>
<P>
 Even moving in this direction doesn't guarantee Clinton peace with a more 
Republican Congress: On Sunday, Bob Dole said that one of his first priorities 
as Senate majority leader, should the occasion arise, would be to repeal the 
prevention programs in the crime bill. Given the gulf between the agenda of 
Clinton and the Republicans, the likelihood of losses among Democratic 
moderates who could bolster the center and the adrenalin-rush the election 
results are likely to provide the confrontational forces in the GOP, there's 
probably no way to avoid enough bloodletting in Washington next year to satisfy 
even Quentin Tarantino. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a difference between conflict and utter implosion. Clinton is not 
as blameless for the polarization in Washington as he suggests. His economic 
and health plans were written to appeal solely to Democrats. But Republicans 
clearly escalated the hostilities in the last weeks of the congressional 
session, when they razed anything with Clinton's name on it, like a tribal army 
in an ethnic war. 
</P>
<P>
 The locust wind lifting the party's sails this fall will give Republicans more 
power, but that could also expose them to greater risk if they can't temper the 
belligerent instincts symbolized by Gingrich's remarks. "If they make gains, 
they are going to have to be more responsible," Clinton said defiantly, "or it 
will be more obvious why progress isn't being made." That may be an optimistic 
spin, but Clinton said it with the confidence of a man who has been through 
enough political conflict to know that if it comes to total war, he won't be 
the only one taking casualties.

RAINS KILL 54 IN EUROPE, N. AFRICA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The worst flooding in more than half a century turned northern Italy into a 
disaster area Sunday and killed at least 54 people across southern Europe and 
North Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 With hundreds of people reported missing, the number of dead was expected to 
rise as rescuers reached isolated villages and searched through the rubble of 
destroyed homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The flooding, reportedly the worst in Italy since 1913, swept away bridges and 
whole sections of highway and cut off hundreds of villages. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardest hit was Italy's northern Piedmont region. At least 27 people were dead 
or missing. Twenty-four inches of rain had fallen in Piedmont over 60 hours by 
late Sunday. The rain was expected to continue another 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 In neighboring France, where six people died, the storms forced Nice's 
international airport to close until Tuesday. Phones, water, electricity and 
roads also were cut in hundreds of villages in southern France, Spain and 
across the Mediterranean in Morocco.

ENDING SICILIAN TRIP, POPE IS DAUNTLESS DESPITE DISABILITY; RELIGION: FORCED TO 
USE A CANE, THE PONTIFF WIELDS IT WITH VERVE. HE SEEMS TO BE SAYING HE'LL KEEP 
TRAVELING. 
</P>

<P>
 Pope John Paul II wound up a three-day visit to Italy's island of history and 
crime in this Sicilian city Sunday with a clear message -- to himself and to 
the 950 million members of the Roman Catholic Church he heads: 
</P>
<P>
 Have cane, will travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Still recovering from a broken right leg he suffered in the spring that has 
cramped his style and sapped his strength, John Paul made the Sicilian visit a 
test of his reduced capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 He found that he can live with them. And he obviously believes that he can do 
so without sacrificing the pastoral trips that are his trademark as history's 
most-traveled pontiff. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope was his usual high-minded, full-throated self as he continued the 
Mafia-bashing that was the gist of his visit to the island where the mob was 
born. 
</P>
<P>
 And he was sharp-witted in feeling-good ad libs that sometimes seemed 
addressed less to Sicilian listeners than to the mourners-in-waiting back in 
Rome who have already written off this papacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, the short black cane he once used with diffident distaste was 
transformed from a sign of weakness to a symbol of determination. 
</P>
<P>
 When he arrived in Sicily on Friday, John Paul seemed frail and uncertain on 
his feet. But after two days of appearances tailored to a man who now has to 
sit more than he used to, the Pope displayed a renewed self-confidence that was 
accompanied by self-mocking irreverence. 
</P>
<P>
 He told one crowd not to bother buying a book of his reflections that is a 
bestseller in Italy. "It's not a book; it's an interview," he said. Explaining 
the brevity of a speech to young people here, John Paul said, "I don't want to 
sound like an old man who talks too much." 
</P>
<P>
 And speaking of a planned visit to a World Youth Day meeting in Manila in 
January that has seemed a papal long shot after last month's cancellation for 
health reasons of a visit to the United States, John Paul teased a crowd in 
Catania on Friday, "Do you have your ticket?" 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to the theme Saturday, speaking in high good humor to young people 
after delivering a get-with-it speech he had brought with him from the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am preparing for a meeting in Manila," he said. "I'm going to Manila with 
my cane. I think I'll get there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some say the cane has made me older," the Pope said to shouts of "No!" from 
the crowd. "But others say it has rejuvenated me." The crowd roared, "Yes!" 
</P>
<P>
 "I am happy to see that you are pro-cane and not anti-cane," the 74-year-old 
Pope smiled, waving the cane with a practiced sense of theatrics. 
</P>
<P>
 What John Paul seemed to be saying is that while he needs the cane, he does 
not intend to let it curtail his travels -- or, implicitly, his reign. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as certainly, in his travels there will be concessions to age and 
infirmity: In Sicily, John Paul sat more at Mass, blessing the gifts and 
reading the homily from his throne. 
</P>
<P>
 To see and be seen, he appeared in Catania on the balcony of the archbishop's 
palace where he was staying, a substitute for the around-town visits he used to 
make. Instead of going to visit prisoners in jail, he was visited by them. 
Instead of reading a speech prepared for the prisoners, he gave them the text. 
</P>
<P>
 Stairs trouble the Pope: In Sicily, organizers arranged screened industrial 
lifts -- with red carpets -- to raise John Paul up to altars. 
</P>
<P>
 After 16 grueling years as Pope, John Paul is increasingly stooped and often 
looks wan. His left hand shakes. Still, he seemed far stronger in Sicily than 
on visits to Zagreb, Croatia, and Lecce, Italy, in September.

 North Atlantic Treaty Organization warplanes buzzed Sarajevo on Sunday in a 
show of force to halt escalating fighting that threatened to plunge Bosnia's 
capital back into warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, U.N. commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina, met Bosnian Vice 
President Ejup Ganic to protest the fighting.Another U.N. official spoke by 
phone with the Bosnian Serbs at their headquarters in Pale, east of Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides were given "the same kind of warning" about the deteriorating 
situation, said Rose's spokesman, Lt. Col. Tim Spicer. He did not elaborate.

 Fighting around the capital reignited Saturday when government forces fired 
four mortar shells from the southern suburb of Hrasnica at Bosnian Serb 
positions in Ilidza, southwest of the capital, U.N. military spokesman Maj. 
Koos Sol said.

DIANA REPORTEDLY PLANNING COMEBACK; ROYALTY: PRINCE CHARLES' ESTRANGED WIFE IS 
SAID TO BE PREPARING TO RETURN TO PUBLIC LIFE 'WITH A VENGEANCE' -- AS THE 
BRITISH RED CROSS' HEAD FUND-RAISER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Princess Diana is planning to make a splashy comeback into public life as the 
head of fund-raising efforts for the British Red Cross, it was reported here 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The London Sunday Times said that Diana, the estranged wife of Prince Charles, 
is preparing to return to the public eye -- in her words, "with a vengeance" -- 
after halting major public appearances a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Diana's new role came about after conversations with Queen Elizabeth II, 
according to excerpts from biographer Andrew Morton's new book, "Diana: Her New 
Life." 
</P>
<P>
 The book reports that Diana had explored an assignment as a roving ambassador. 
Morton says that Prime Minister John Major was enthusiastic about the idea but 
that it was vetoed by officials at Buckingham Palace on the grounds that such a 
role would upstage Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the excerpts, author Morton says that Diana is refusing to initiate divorce 
proceedings against Charles because she does not want to be blamed for a 
"constitutional crisis" involving the monarchy, hoping instead that her husband 
will file the divorce papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton says that Diana hopes to remarry one day and have more children, 
preferably girls, although she has no potential suitor in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Diana is said to feel that she "is the biggest prostitute in the world" 
because of the way she has been used in the past for various public and charity 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
 She also admitted, according to Morton, that she and her royal in-laws have 
often been at odds -- and that she views the palace, most family members and 
their courtiers as a "leper colony." 
</P>
<P>
 The author says that Diana has an obsessional interest in astrologers, 
mystics, clairvoyants and fortunetellers -- and that she tries to contact dead 
friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, Morton says she believes that in a previous incarnation she was a 
nun. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton reports that Diana is fascinated about Charles' relationship with his 
married mistress, Camilla Parker-Bowles, and has tried to discern where they 
met for trysts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Morton is thought to be close to many of Diana's friends, Buckingham 
Palace sources insist that he has not been in direct contact with the princess 
for about two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The book says that Diana is still battling an eating disorder, bulimia, and 
that she takes the antidepressant drug Prozac. 
</P>
<P>
 In summing up what she would like to see in the future, Morton says the 
princess has mused to friends, "If I was able to write my own script, I would 
hope that my husband would go off with his lady and leave me and the children 
to carry the Wales name until William (her elder son) ascends the throne."

HUNDREDS BID FAREWELL TO SLAIN S. CAROLINA BOYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mourners for two children allegedly murdered by their mother in a crime that 
shocked the nation crowded into a small brick church Sunday to bid the boys 
farewell. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds more stood outside the church under a gray November sky and listened 
to loudspeakers broadcasting funeral services for 3-year-old Michael Smith and 
his 14-month-old brother, Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael and Alex are home," the Rev. Bob Cato, a Baptist minister from Union, 
told the congregation. "I like to think of them sitting in the lap of God." 
</P>
<P>
 The mother of the boys, Susan Smith, was arraigned on murder charges Friday 
and is being held in a state prison in Columbia, S.C., under a suicide watch. 
Smith had claimed for nine days that the boys had been abducted in a 
carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, said to be distraught over money problems, a failed marriage and a 
disappointing romance, has admitted sending the car in which the children were 
sleeping in their safety seats to the bottom of a lake, where they drowned, 
police say. 
</P>
<P>
 CNN, which said it obtained the mother's confession, reported that she 
intended to go into the lake with her children. "I dropped to the lowest when I 
allowed my children to go down that ramp into the water without me. I took off 
running and screaming, 'Oh God, oh God no. What have I done,' " the confession 
read. 
</P>
<P>
 David Bruck, Susan Smith's lawyer, confirmed the reports of the confession. 
But he denied a published report that she watched one of her sons struggling to 
get out of his safety seat as the car rolled into the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Sunday, an attorney for Susan Smith told WSPA-TV that she has received 
death threats. 
</P>
<P>
 A small white coffin containing the bodies of both boys was brought into the 
church by pallbearers from the Holcombe Funeral Home in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 The family of their father, David Smith, later arrived with an escort of more 
than a dozen police cruisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue and white ribbons hung from oaks that lined the approach to the church in 
Buffalo, near the Smiths' town of Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services began with an organ solo of "Jesus Loves Me" and went on to 
the Christmas carol "Away in a Manger." 
</P>
<P>
 After the service, David Smith, with bowed shoulders and a handkerchief 
stifling his sobs, followed as the coffin was wheeled from the church. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, about 125 people gathered at the predominantly black St. Paul Baptist 
Church to talk about how Union can heal the racial divisions caused by Susan 
Smith's original story that her sons were abducted by a black man.

ELECTIONS '94; GAY RIGHTS FOES TAKE TO BALLOT AGAIN; ELECTION: DESPITE LOSING 
IN '92, AN OREGON GROUP IS BACKING A REVISED MEASURE TO BAN LAWS PROTECTING 
HOMOSEXUALS. IDAHO HAS A VERSION TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTINA BOXALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forgive the Oregon voter who may be a tad confused about what year this is. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as in the fall of 1992, radio and television advertisements boom warnings 
about gay propaganda infiltrating the schools, of taxpayers being forced to 
subsidize the promotion of homosexuality. Warnings of censorship and 
state-sanctioned discrimination boom back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oregon Citizens Alliance, author of a failed 1992 anti-gay-rights 
initiative that riveted the state, is on the ballot again with a revised 
version. The arguments are much the same this time, although some of the fizz 
has gone out of the fight. Not only is it Round 2, but there are a number of 
other controversial initiatives grabbing the media's attention this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd definitely say the decibel level is a hell of a lot lower," said Portland 
pollster Tim Hibbitts, who predicts that this fall's toned-down measure will 
garner more votes than its predecessor and even has a chance of passing. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with a similar proposal in Idaho, the Oregon initiative is one of two 
anti-gay-rights measures on state ballots this week, far fewer than 
conservative activists had hoped for but testament nonetheless to their 
determination to keep the issue alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Initiative proponents in both states are trailing in the polls and lagging 
behind in financial donations and political endorsements. Even if the measures 
pass, they will surely wind up in court. A milder anti-gay-rights referendum 
approved by Colorado voters in 1992 was recently declared unconstitutional by 
that state's Supreme Court. And in a formal opinion, the Idaho attorney general 
has said his state's ballot proposal is also unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 None of that seems to faze initiative backers, who insist they have their 
fingers on the public pulse. "I anticipate this thing passing by 56% to 60%," 
said Dennis Mansfield, one of the drafters of Idaho's Proposition 1 and 
executive director of Idaho Family Forum, associated with the national 
conservative group Focus on the Family. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly the history of the Colorado initiative gives him hope. Behind in the 
polls and endorsements before the '92 election, the referendum won anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Hibbitts does not think the Colorado court ruling will influence 
voters. "It's an emotional vote, not a vote based on what a judge says one way 
or the other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oregon and Idaho proposals have virtually identical goals -- not 
surprisingly, since the Idaho Citizens Alliance, the principal sponsor of that 
state's measure, is an offshoot of the Oregon group. 
</P>
<P>
 Both initiatives would prevent state and local government from adopting laws 
protecting gay men and lesbians from discrimination or recognizing same-sex 
partnerships. The measures would further forbid the spending of public money in 
any way that implies approval of homosexuality or its sympathetic treatment in 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole key is that there will not be . . . the endorsement of it as an 
acceptable lifestyle," Mansfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to make this year's measure more palatable to Oregon voters, the 
OCA dropped the charged language of the 1992 proposal, which lumped 
homosexuality with sadism and pedophilia and condemned it as "abnormal, wrong, 
unnatural and perverse." 
</P>
<P>
 The group also has included wording intended to counter some of the more 
effective opposition arguments used two years ago -- that the constitutional 
amendment would bar the government licensing of gay professionals and rid 
public library shelves of literary classics that contain even a hint of 
homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents argue that Measure 13, as it is known, is the same old thing 
wrapped in a prettier package. "It's legal discrimination," said Dennis 
Brodigan of the No on 13 campaign. "It's legal censorship. It curtails 
curriculum that can be taught." 
</P>
<P>
 In both states, the opposition campaigns are hitting pragmatic themes. So 
completely do their advertisements sidestep discussions of homosexuality that 
it is often hard to figure out that the initiatives have anything to do with 
gay men and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 Idaho's No on 1 Coalition warns that the proposed measure "dictates 
interference in the lives of all Idahoans" and will cost taxpayers millions of 
dollars to implement and defend in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the conservative reputation of the state, the coalition has amassed an 
impressive array of allies, ranging from the governor to the Catholic bishop of 
Boise. "Many of the conservatives in this state are fiscal, economic 
conservatives and not social morality conservatives," said Don Crowley, 
chairman of the University of Idaho's political science department. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of out-of-state contributions, the No on 1 group raised 
$500,000, according to campaign manager Diane Sands. The coalition's media 
advertising expenditures of $250,000 overshadows the $20,000 spent on 
television by initiative supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Mansfield says, the pro-Proposition 1 group is getting plenty out of 
its limited TV time. "I'm sure it knocks a couple of potato farmers off their 
sofas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking cues from other anti-gay campaigns, the Proposition 1 ads feature 
provocative clips of transvestites in big-city gay-pride parades, interviews 
with gays bragging about their political clout and the comments of African 
Americans complaining that gay men and lesbians have no right to the civil 
rights protections granted blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oregon group, which portrayed gays as diseased, homicidal child molesters 
in its 1992 campaign, has tempered its rhetoric somewhat this year. Still, the 
group last month claimed that homosexuals were responsible for the Holocaust. 
Questions of accuracy also kept an OCA television ad off the air until a 
sympathetic congressional candidate incorporated it into one of his campaign 
spots. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad cites a disputed incident in a suburban school district as evidence of 
the promotion of homosexuality by public educators. District officials say the 
OCA version is exaggerated and inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the outcome of the two referendums, the future holds promise of more 
of the same. An anti-gay initiative will appear on the Maine ballot next year. 
And if the OCA fails a second time, it vows to try again in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "One election cycle we're going to get a majority," said OCA chairman Lon 
Mabon. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay-rights proponents, for their part, say the initiative battles are sowing 
seeds of activism in fresh ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to squash gays and lesbians," Sands said of her Idaho foes. 
"They've in fact brought the gay, lesbian and bisexual community together."

GLOBAL WILDLIFE SUMMIT UNDER WAY; ENVIRONMENT: OFFICIALS FROM 124 NATIONS 
GATHER IN FLORIDA TO DRAFT POLICY ON ENDANGERED ANIMAL AND PLANT SPECIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It all started two decades ago with leopards, chimpanzees and crocodiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as 124 nations convene in Florida to decide the fate of the world's 
rarest and most coveted creatures, their mission has expanded in scope, 
encompassing more than 25,000 protected animals and plants -- from orchids to 
tigers -- that have been exploited for enormous worldwide profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting today, cabinet-level ministers and their entourage of several 
thousand delegates gather for a two-week summit to update and perhaps overhaul 
the world's largest conservation treaty, the Convention on International Trade 
in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. 
</P>
<P>
 Often pitting nation against nation, the pact is designed to halt the 
exploitation of wild creatures for profit -- from elephants culled for their 
ivory to whales harpooned for their meat -- by banning or restricting the 
lucrative trade of products from rare and exotic species. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of the first gathering in the United States since the treaty's 
conception in 1973, each government is gearing up for politically charged 
decisions that are critical to many nations' environments and economies. 
</P>
<P>
 "CITES is one of the longest-standing conservation treaties and by many 
accounts the most successful," said Ginette Hemley, director of international 
policy for the World Wildlife Fund, a global conservation group. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has helped a number of species recover and helped countries maintain trade 
in a sustainable way," she said. "But we need some real results, some real 
decisions from the countries attending this meeting. It takes political will to 
make CITES work and stop illegal trade." 
</P>
<P>
 Several dozen controversial species are up for debate at the Ft. Lauderdale 
summit. Included are proposals to partially lift a ban on the export of African 
elephant products, proposed new restrictions on sale of mahogany from South 
America and Mexico, and Norway's request to ease the ban on whaling by allowing 
trade in minke whales. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these global feuds pit the wealthy United States, Western Europe and 
Japan -- the major buyers of wildlife products -- against poorer African and 
Latin American nations -- the major exporters -- that want to retain control 
over their own natural resources and sustain their economies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a difficult task because, in addition to the scientific information, 
one should take into consideration economic and enforcement problems, and even 
political concerns," Obdulio Menghi, scientific coordinator of the CITES 
Secretariat, based in Geneva, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. delegation, headed by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, has not yet 
decided its stance on the most heated issues, especially how to vote on South 
Africa's elephant proposal. South Africa has petitioned to partially lift the 
1989 ban on elephant trade by allowing sales of hide while retaining the ban on 
ivory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration wants to ensure its position does not jeopardize 
U.S. relations with South African President Nelson Mandela, so Vice President 
Al Gore will make the final decision based on input from Babbitt and other 
wildlife officials, members of the National Security Council and U.S. trade 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa is overpopulated with elephants due to that nation's strong 
conservation efforts, and officials there say if they can sell some hides from 
culled herds, they will allocate the money to enhance their crackdown on 
poachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most member nations agree with South Africa in theory, yet some worry that 
cracking open the window to limited trade could revive an uncontrolled rush of 
poachers and spur illegal sales of ivory. Conservation and animal-rights groups 
are divided on the proposal, too. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, the treaty has succeeded in protecting species, mostly through 
public-awareness campaigns in the richer Western nations. For instance, ivory 
products are decidedly unfashionable in the United States and Europe, causing a 
steep decline in elephant poaching since the creatures were unanimously 
protected in 1989. While Kenya lost up to 5,000 elephants per year during the 
1980s, now fewer than 50 are killed annually, according to the Environmental 
Investigation Agency, a Washington, D.C.-based environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt's team also has been divided on whether to vote to restrict sales of 
mahogany from Brazil and Mexico, a move that timber traders and U.S. furniture 
manufacturers have campaigned against. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is the largest importer of tropical mahogany, a popular wood 
for furniture, but U.S. government officials are split on the issue. The U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service says the forests need protection, while U.S. forestry 
officials argue they do not. Babbitt reportedly has reached a decision, but the 
result has not been revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, sale of mahogany would remain legal, but Mexico and Brazil 
would regulate its trade, which would cause a price hike and perhaps some 
shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 "The timber proposal is very hot. It has torn up the U.S. government 
internally," Hemley said. "The Forest Service has come out with guns blazing." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the delegates adjourn on Nov. 18, they also will wrestle with setting 
standards for deciding which species to protect and which ones to reject. Most 
of the nations, including the United States, want the decisions based on 
science rather than politics and emotions, while others are pushing for more 
flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The countries will also debate how to halt widespread poaching and black 
markets in violation of the treaty, oftentimes in countries that lack the will 
or funds to initiate conservation programs. 
</P>
<P>
 If a nation fails to enforce the treaty it signed, the others have the 
authority to impose trade sanctions. That, however, rarely occurs because of 
global political sensitivities and financial dilemmas. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, tigers in India and Russia's far east, despite the treaty's 
highest level of protection, are still being decimated by poachers who hawk the 
rare animals' bones for use in Asian medicines. The rhinoceros is also near 
extinction because of an illegal, lucrative black market for its horns. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. environmentalists fear that if the session adjourns without resolving 
enforcement dilemmas, Siberian and Bengal tigers and African rhinos could 
nearly be wiped out by the time the delegates convene again in two to three 
years. The World Wildlife Fund is urging wealthier nations to help Russia and 
India by offering financial aid and training. 
</P>
<P>
 When the accord was signed in Washington, D.C., in 1973, there were only 21 
signatories, as varied as Brazil, the United Kingdom, Iran, South Africa and 
Thailand. The treaty now bans trade of more than 600 species and restricts it 
for more than 25,000 others.

ROBBER SLAIN AFTER TAKING HOSTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A gunman who fled with a hostage from a hair salon robbery in Walnut Park was 
shot to death by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies Saturday night, 
authorities said. The woman hostage escaped and was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Alerted that four women were being held at gunpoint inside, deputies arrived 
at the shop, located at 7848 Pacific Blvd., shortly before 8 p.m., said Deputy 
Diane Hecht. Taking along one woman hostage with a gun pointed to her head, the 
gunman managed to drive his car about a quarter of a mile as deputies fired at 
its tires. 
</P>
<P>
 After the gunman's car crashed into a fence, the woman escaped, Hecht said. 
The 27-year-old gunman -- whose identity was being withheld pending 
notification of his family -- was shot to death by deputies, she said.

SEXUAL HARASSMENT BY 7 NAVY INSTRUCTORS ALLEGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven male instructors at a Navy school are being investigated for allegedly 
demanding sexual favors from women students in exchange for passing grades, a 
Navy spokesman said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter involves at least 16 enlisted women who were learning to operate 
the Navy's computer and telephone networks at the Naval Training Center in San 
Diego, according to a school spokesman, Lt. Patrick Dennison. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the allegations involve verbal harassment, with some physical abuse 
such as grabbing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennison said each of the seven has served at least six years in the Navy -- 
"long enough to know better." 
</P>
<P>
 None of those under investigation has been charged. Dennison said that if any 
were to be charged and found guilty, "it's pretty much a career-ender." 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged harassment occurred between March, 1993, and September of this 
year, when an investigation was ordered. The investigation has been slowed by 
the fact that of the 23 people alleged to be involved, only four -- two victims 
and two harassers -- are still at the school, Dennison said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation was also reported in the Nov. 14 issue of Newsweek. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations could further tarnish the Navy's record on sexual harassment. 
Dozens of women said they were groped and molested by drunken Navy and Marine 
aviators at the 1991 Tailhook Assn. convention at the Las Vegas Hilton.

TORRENTIAL STORM BEGINS TO FADE IN SAN FRANCISCO AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A winter storm began to fade Sunday, after bringing torrential rain to parts 
of Northern California while causing mudslides and minor flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm set a 24-hour record for rainfall in San Francisco, flooded roads 
and basements throughout the Bay Area and caused two minor mudslides in 
Tiburon, police and fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco saw a record rainfall of 6.16 inches for the 24-hour period 
ending Sunday morning, meteorologist David MacPherson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kentfield in Marin County had the most rain in the state, with more than 10.11 
inches for the duration of the storm, while almost 8 inches was reported at 
Corte Madera. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain helped ease concerns about another drought year. It also was a 
welcome break for ski resort managers, who saw more than 18 inches of snow 
fall.

CROSSED SIGNALS SILENCE LINK TO SHUTTLE; SCIENCE: MISSION CONTROL REGAINS 
CONTACT AFTER EIGHT MINUTES OF CONFUSION. NASA REPORTS NO LOSS IN DATA OR 
DANGER TO ATLANTIS' CREW.

<P>
 NASA briefly lost contact with the space shuttle Atlantis and its six 
astronauts Sunday because of crossed radio signals. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem occurred as Atlantis switched from one Tracking and Data Relay 
Satellite to another, a routine procedure during shuttle flights.Mission 
Control uses the satellite network to monitor shuttle systems and talk to the 
crew. 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time as the switch, a computer failed at the Tracking and Data 
Relay Satellite station at White Sands, N.M., and a backup quickly was 
activated. 
</P>
<P>
 Communication with Atlantis was restored after eight minutes, but it was an 
hour before engineers realized crossed signals were to blame for the loss of 
contact, not the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the satellite switch, ground controllers had sent a command to 
change Atlantis' radio system from one channel to another. The command never 
got through because the shuttle was changing its position. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Mission Control was trying to communicate with Atlantis on one 
channel while the shuttle was tuned in to another. Another radio system 
automatically kicked in, and communications returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Atlantis nor its crew was in any danger, and no science data was lost, 
said Mission Control. 
</P>
<P>
 A German satellite loaded with infrared and ultraviolet telescopes trailed the 
shuttle in orbit by less than 60 miles. The astronauts released the satellite 
Friday so it could measure ozone and atmospheric gases without interference 
from the shuttle. They'll pick it up Saturday for the trip home. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the seven atmospheric and solar-energy monitors flying on Atlantis 
continued to work well. The seventh -- a German ozone monitor -- remained 
broken.

39 CUBANS ESCAPE GUANTANAMO WITH DARING DIVE, SWIM; REFUGEES: THE ESCAPEES 
CRUSHED FENCES WITH COTS AND JUMPED OFF A CLIFF. THEIR DESPERATION EMPHASIZES 
THE DILEMMA OVER REPATRIATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirty-nine Cuban refugees escaped from the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, 
Cuba, on Sunday by crushing two fences, jumping off a 40-foot cliff and 
swimming a mile to Cuban territory. 
</P>
<P>
 The escapees were in a group of 85 who made it outside the camp. Forty-six 
were caught and returned, said Army Maj. Rick Thomas, a camp spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The escape came one day after 22 Cubans were flown back to Havana. Their 
repatriations followed an appeals court decision that overturned a U.S. 
District Court order banning voluntary returns. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta ruled Friday that refugees 
can be returned to their homeland and have a right to speak to lawyers. The 
court said its decision was necessary because Cubans are risking their lives to 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
 The escapes are just another sign of growing anger among the refugees, who 
were picked up at sea fleeing their homeland, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Sunday, a refugee tried to commit suicide by slashing his arm, he said. 
The man was treated at the base hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "The process has been real slow," Thomas said. "What they want to hear is when 
they can return to Cuba, but that's something we can't tell them." 
</P>
<P>
 Cuban American lawyers had filed a lawsuit to stop repatriations, saying the 
refugees should first speak to lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, 105 refugees tried to escape Guantanamo by jumping in the sea or 
over fences. Some were rescued; 43 remain unaccounted for. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, 64 Cubans have been repatriated, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 85 who fled Sunday were from a tent city housing about 800 Cubans who say 
they want to return home. 
</P>
<P>
 The group piled up cots and boards to push down two six-foot-high fences, then 
jumped off a nearby cliff, plunging 40 feet to the sea, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 They swam about a mile, beyond the Cuban minefield territory, to shore. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, about 1,000 of the 24,000 Cubans at Guantanamo and another 8,000 under 
U.S. supervision at camps in Panama say they want to go home. It was unclear 
when more refugees will be allowed to return to Cuba.

GEORGE RAMOS: PROP. 187 DIVIDES A FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have it all wrong about Proposition 187, a faithful reader of my column 
insisted the other day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prop. 187 isn't racist," she said. "It isn't anti-Mexican. It's against 
people who are in the United States illegally. They are in the wrong. We can't 
allow people to take advantage of this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past months, I have argued with this reader over this proposition, 
but I haven't won her over to my viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 So tomorrow, my mother is voting for Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not even the guy who stamps "Wetback Go Home" on his letters has got me as 
worked up as Mom does with her support for the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, my Mexican mother -- born in the United States of illegal-immigrant 
parents -- is the person who corrected me when I misstated facts about Mexican 
history as a boy. On trips to Chihuahua and Durango, she introduced me to the 
"illegal alien" responsible for her being born here. I remember being in awe of 
that woman, grandmother Paula Fraire Vasquez Medina, admiring her for raising 
seven kids by herself in Depression-era L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Mom's also the one who got me interested in politics. I still recall her 
stories of how she voted for a winner -- Harry S. Truman -- in her first 
presidential election in 1948. When her man, Democrat Adlai Stevenson, lost to 
Dwight D. Eisenhower four years later, she cried. 
</P>
<P>
 She and I were glued to the radio and TV coverage of the '56 presidential 
conventions. I didn't know who Estes Kefauver and John F. Kennedy were, but she 
let me know these guys were important to the republic. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's in the past. Now, Mom is into new ideals. 
</P>
<P>
 She's a fan of Rush Limbaugh. She likes him not just because his radio 
programs kept her grieving mind occupied after my father died. She believes in 
his anti-Washington, anti-liberal agenda: She equates evil with virtually all 
Democrats, President Clinton, newspaper columnists and, most recently, illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 When we gathered recently in her kitchen, with brother Daniel acting as 
referee, her support for 187 was clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unconstitutional," I argued. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it might not work," she answered, "but we need to send a message. We 
are overrun by illegals." 
</P>
<P>
 "Would you think it fair to kick kids out of school because their parents are 
illegal?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "They won't get kicked out of school right away because they'll be fighting it 
out in court (over 187's constitutionality)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She tried to bait me to make me see the wrongheadedness of my arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you see all those Mexican flags in the Downtown march?" she asked coyly. 
"What do you think of them doing that?" 
</P>
<P>
 I saw nothing sinister in the display of pride in those marchers' cultural 
roots. But she detected misplaced loyalties. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the United States," she thundered. "Speak English! Show the American 
flag!" 
</P>
<P>
 I reminded her that we were arguing in English because Dan doesn't speak 
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, it got personal. 
</P>
<P>
 She thinks illegals come here to get on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like Grandma Paula?" I asked, knowing my mother's mother never sought a dime 
of welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wasn't a burden," Mom retorted. "She eventually returned to Mexico 
voluntarily." 
</P>
<P>
 "So, in order words," I countered, "you got yours. The illegals of today can 
go get theirs someplace else?" 
</P>
<P>
 I admit I was mean, but I meant what I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't you see the irony of what you're saying?" I persisted. "If Proposition 
187 had passed in your day, you'd be thrown out of school. Grandma would have 
been reported to the authorities. You'd be singled out because you're different 
-- you speak Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
 Mom was unmoved. "I'm an American citizen," she concluded. "I don't see any 
irony. The thing is, I've never seen it that way. I just feel that right now, 
illegal aliens are getting to be too much of a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The air was tense enough without me saying something I'd regret later. I just 
let her words sink in for a few moments. Then my brother let her have it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're a hypocrite, Mother," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The argument across California over Proposition 187 won't die after tomorrow's 
election. Likewise the kitchen debates with my Mexican mother. I guess that's 
because she gave me a sense of what it's like to be Chicano: to have pride in 
two cultures, two languages and two traditions and to be a good American. 
That's why I'm voting tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of our talk, Mom shook her head when I announced that on 187, she 
was outvoted by me and my brother, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Her reply was typically Mom: "I love you, mijo , but you're wrong on 
Proposition 187."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD; 
HUNTINGTON BEACH: MICRO-SCALE WELFARE REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Single parents without job skills who have left a violent mate or lack spousal 
support have few economic options. Even full-time entry-level jobs pay wages 
that don't cover a family's rent, medical expenses, child care and food bills. 
Such parents risk becoming ensnared in long-term dependence on public support. 
This cycle has prompted a national call for welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Project Self-Sufficiency, a city-based program in Huntington Beach, eases 
single parents off welfare by finding them housing, education and employment 
and helping them end their public assistance after no more than five years. It 
differs from other programs with similar goals by providing comprehensive, 
one-on-one support. The project's staff works with participants to evaluate and 
meet their individual needs for housing, job training, education, child care, 
transportation and emergency assistance. A citywide network of more than 800 
volunteers supplements staff efforts through Adopt-a-Family holiday gift 
programs, cash contributions and donations of goods and services such as car 
repairs, reconditioned computers, furniture and appliances. Of 280 families 
that have participated in Project Self-Sufficiency since it began a decade ago, 
210 no longer receive welfare subsidies. STEPS TO SELF-SUFFICIENCY 
</P>
<P>
 1. Application and Screening 
</P>
<P>
 Low-income single parents with custody of children younger than 18 who live in 
Huntington Beach or in a shelter anywhere in Orange County are eligible to 
apply. Applicants submit two letters of recommendation and are interviewed to 
determine their motivation and commitment to the program goals. The program has 
room to accept only a fraction of applicants. There are currently about 100 
families enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Enrollment and Assessment 
</P>
<P>
 Within one month of acceptance, participants design and begin to follow 
written action plans that outline steps they will take to become 
self-sufficient. The contract, updated frequently with the help of the project 
staff, details job training, education, counseling and other activities they 
must pursue. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Recognition and Graduation 
</P>
<P>
 At an annual gathering, participants are recognized for accomplishments such 
as completing their education degrees, maintaining employment for six months, 
ending government assistance and performing community service. They graduate 
after completing their action plans, a process that may take no longer than 
five years. WHO PAYS WHAT 
</P>
<P>
 Yearly cost: $100,000 
</P>
<P>
 80%: City of Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 20%: Donations and grants 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in Huntington Beach from the mayor on down to local businesses and 
residents who support the program knows that they are turning welfare 
recipients into productive members of their community. Project Self Sufficiency 
is meant to help you get the life you want: it's not meant to be your life." TO

FOOTNOTES / JAMES BATES: DOES THE ORACLE SEE A WIN? 
</P>

<P>
 Will the gods be with GOP candidate Mike Huffington in Tuesday's U.S. Senate 
race with incumbent Dianne Feinstein? 
</P>
<P>
 Hard to say with his campaign slipping in recent weeks. But maybe the 
goddesses will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the latest offerings in the local seminar business is a $29 course this 
month titled "Access the Goddesses Within You" taught by Huffington's 
sister-in-law, Agapi Stassinopoulos. 
</P>
<P>
 The course goal: to "let the wisdom of the ancient goddesses guide and 
enlighten you." 
</P>
<P>
 Stassinopoulos is an actress and producer as well as sister of Arianna 
Stassinopoulos Huffington, wife of the Senate candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Stassinopoulos' course is scheduled Nov. 30 on the Westside through the 
Learning Annex course organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the topics listed in the course description are "How Aphrodite can help 
you to have more passion and love in your life," "How Athena brings forward 
higher wisdom in all your endeavors," "How Artemis can bring more freedom and 
independence" and how matrimony goddess Hera can assist "if you're looking for 
that perfect union with another." Vote of Confidence 
</P>
<P>
 If there was an award for consistently humble public acceptance of jobs, Danny 
Goldberg, newly crowned chairman of Warner Bros. Records, might well win. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Goldberg, who got the job after serving as president of Atlantic 
Records, was quoted in the Times as saying: "The biggest challenge for me is to 
not screw this job up." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten months ago, when he was elevated to president of Atlantic, Goldberg said: 
"My main goal is to not screw up what already is a very strong and healthy 
company." Term Paper 
</P>
<P>
 A sheet of paper titled "Dictionary of Hollywood" has been making the rounds 
on entertainment industry fax machines lately, providing a creative, albeit 
cynical, take on some of the common descriptions and phrases regularly used in 
the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Residuals equals "braces for the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 * Deferral equals "don't hold your breath." 
</P>
<P>
 * Net equals "something that apparently doesn't exist." 
</P>
<P>
 * Gross equals "Michael Eisner's salary." 
</P>
<P>
 * Highly qualified equals "knows the producer." 
</P>
<P>
 * To pitch equals "grovel shamelessly." 
</P>
<P>
 * To free-lance equals "collect unemployment." 
</P>
<P>
 * The phrase "You'll never work in this town again " equals "I have no power 
whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
 * "It's all up on the screen" equals "You'll never find the money I 
embezzled." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Call me back next week" equals "Stay out of my life." Briefly. . . 
</P>

AT JOURNEY'S END: REFLECTING ON THE GREAT DIVIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAMB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every time I see an adult on a bicycle, I no longer despair for the future of 
the human race.  
</P>
<P>
 -- H.G. Wells From the moment I left home on my bicycle -- 3,012 miles, 59 
days and eight flat tires ago -- the destination was what mattered most, and 
now, just ahead where the Santa Monica Pier juts into the Pacific, I could 
finally see the journey's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Great joy in camp," Meriwether Lewis had written 189 years earlier when the 
Corps of Discovery came within view of the Pacific, and I, too, felt that 
elation. What seemed a lifetime of miles had been reduced to a few manageable 
yards. No longer would mere movement be the expression of my purpose or 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 I pushed onto the pier, my 54-year-old body not quite as creaky as it had been 
when I left Virginia on Labor Day weekend. A group of friends awaited me with a 
bottle of champagne. One of them asked if I had given up cigarettes, whiskey 
and junk food along the way. No way, I said, I couldn't have survived without 
them. Did I ever feel threatened since leaving Virginia? someone else wanted to 
know. 
</P>
<P>
 Only here in Santa Monica, I replied. I had meandered getting to the pier and 
everywhere I turned were vacant-eyed, raggedy people. I found them urinating in 
alleys, pawing through dumpsters, sprawled in grassy parks, a babble of 
incoherent voices and gnarled fingers that reached out for money. It was a 
nightmarish vision so alien to the back roads' America where I had spent the 
last two months that I wondered if I had landed on another planet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our high school class went to Washington two years ago," a waitress had said 
to me back in Monteagle, Tenn., "and near one of the monuments we saw a man 
sleeping on one of those heating grates. I said, 'Why doesn't he just go home?' 
Our teacher said, 'He can't; he doesn't have a home.' Doesn't have a home ? I 
couldn't believe it. It was one of the strangest things I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everywhere I went I was reminded, as in Monteagle, how great the divide 
is between rural and urban America. Our big coastal population centers may set 
the national agenda, but in the little towns that reach across Appalachia, 
through the Oklahoma Panhandle and into the Southwestern desert one hears the 
unheralded voices of another America -- an America that is old-fashioned, 
hard-working, trusting and not at all concerned with how many grams of fat are 
in a blueberry muffin. 
</P>
<P>
 When I told a man I met on the old Route 66 in Seligman, Ariz., that I might 
not get home until Thanksgiving, he was shocked. "How are you going to vote ?" 
he demanded. "You'll miss the elections." To him, such an abrogation of duty 
was unfathomable.

 Although some yahoo did throw a beer bottle at me from his pickup back in 
Virginia, it would perhaps surprise people in urban America to know that I 
crossed the country from the Potomac to the Pacific without encountering a 
single harrowing moment or a major mishap. Only loneliness and isolation gave 
me cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
 My American-made bike -- a Trek 520 -- proved as roadworthy as the most 
expensive Mercedes-Benz, and it strikes me as remarkable that such a simple 
contraption was capable of carrying me so far without extracting a single penny 
for fuel, oil or mechanical repairs. To most adult Americans, the bicycle is no 
more than a toy, but as our city streets clog with traffic, it is worth noting 
that this affordable machine is still the prime source of transportation for 
the majority of the world's people and remains the most efficient means of 
self-propulsion ever invented. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, I should admit that I am taking the short way back to Virginia. My 
bike is being prepared for shipment at a Wilshire Boulevard shop and this 
continental crossing on United Airlines will take us only six hours. I'm wise 
enough to know when it's time to go home. There is, after all, an election to 
vote in, and besides, I have been on the lam long enough.

CYBURBIA: THE BIRDS AND BEES, VIA YOUR PC

</P>
<P>
 To the age-old kids' question, "Where do babies come from?" there is a new 
answer: 
</P>
<P>
 "Go ask your computer." 
</P>
<P>
 Sex education has entered the digital realm with the release of the kids' 
CD-ROM "AnnaTommy," backed by no less a prestigious institution than the Mayo 
Clinic of Rochester, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
 "AnnaTommy," which is described on the package as "an adventure into the human 
body" for ages 8 and up, is not strictly a sex-education disk, but it does 
broach the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 And in an attempt to make this biological exploration an entertaining 
"adventure," "AnnaTommy" takes on the format of an arcade game, complete with 
colorful graphics and a missile-firing spaceship. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where the creators of "AnnaTommy" went a little wild. 
</P>
<P>
 This is probably the first and last computer game that challenges you to shoot 
explosive bombs into sperm clusters in the testes or into follicle-encased eggs 
in the ovary. 
</P>
<P>
 Fun for the whole family. 
</P>
<P>
 "AnnaTommy," which is currently available only for Windows CD-ROM for about 
$32, begins with a short animated sequence about two junior high honors 
students of the future who have won a trip through the human body. (Makes you 
wonder what second prize was.) 
</P>
<P>
 They and their blue spaceship are miniaturized and then injected into a body, 
a la the 1966 science-fiction movie "Fantastic Voyage." 
</P>
<P>
 A friendly talking computer provides the commentary as Anna and Tommy are 
propelled through the bloodstream. "Now approaching the urinary system!" the 
computer announces with excitement early on. Luckily, the player can choose 
from one of nine other systems to explore, including the nervous, digestive, 
endocrine, skeletal and reproductive. 
</P>
<P>
 Where do we go first? No contest. "Approaching testes!" yells out the computer 
as we steer the ship in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy, at least, is in awe of this inside view. "The reproductive system is a 
pretty intense place," he tells Anna. 
</P>
<P>
 There is trouble ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems sperm cells are not dividing successfully!" the computer suddenly 
warns as we enter the testes. That's when the game starts. You get points for 
every sperm cluster you blast apart, allowing the little chromosome carriers to 
swim free. 
</P>
<P>
 I was viewing this CD-ROM with helpful computer programmer Jim Sabo of The 
Times' new on-line TimesLink service. An old hand at games, Jim immediately 
took to blasting the clusters as he expertly navigated the ship. But he wasn't 
happy about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty scary noise it's making," Jim said with a shudder as he blew apart 
another cluster. I shudder to think what Freud would have made of this. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was on to the female side, just past the "Urethra this way" sign and 
into an ovary. There, we played a similar game to release the eggs trapped 
inside follicles. 
</P>
<P>
 This style of educational game play was pioneered by teacher Jan Davidson, who 
created the hugely successful "Math Blaster" game now used around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson's program forces kids to solve math problems in order for them to get 
the chance to shoot up a spaceship or other fun activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the game action in "AnnaTommy" is almost completely divorced 
from the educational component of the CD-ROM. This makes the information 
imparted by "AnnaTommy" seem little more than an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
 But if it helps educate kids a bit about their bodies, I guess it can be a 
positive experience. After all, it's better they learn a bit about sex here 
than out on the streets. Or even worse, on the Internet.

'STARGATE' KEEPS SURPRISING LEAD OVER THE PACK; MOVIES: THE SCI-FI THRILLER 
HOLDS ONTO THE TOP BOX-OFFICE SPOT DESPITE STIFF COMPETITION FROM HEAVILY HYPED 
STAR VEHICLES 'THE WAR' AND 'MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN.' 
</P>

 The first major movie arrivals of the holiday season -- "Mary Shelley's 
Frankenstein" starring Kenneth Branagh and Robert De Niro and "The War" 
starring Elijah Wood and Kevin Costner -- were ambushed over the weekend by the 
upstart "Stargate." The mystical sci-fi adventure starring Kurt Russell and 
James Spader, which had come out of nowhere to open as the biggest film ever 
for a September or October release ($16.7 million) the previous weekend, held 
with a strong $12.5 million in its second weekend on 2,033 screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Even MGM/UA, which released "Stargate," was anticipating more than a 25% drop, 
said Larry Gleason, the studio's distribution head, especially since TriStar 
Pictures had manned the big media guns to pump life into "Frankenstein." But 
bad reviews sabotaged any electricity generated by the "Frankenstein" trailers 
and TV spots. Columbia/TriStar was estimating $12 million for the opening 
weekend in 2,177 theaters. However, its competitors were predicting that 
"Frankenstein" would wind up grossing closer to $11 million by the close of 
Sunday's business. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way that's not so good for the $40-million-plus epic. Monster movies, 
which this film basically is, require a fast break to score. By comparison, 
"Bram Stoker's Dracula" copped $30.5 million its opening weekend in 
mid-November, 1992, almost 40% of its final gross of $82.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 And if "Frankenstein" was going to attract big business, this weekend looked 
like its best shot. On Friday, "Interview With the Vampire," with Tom Cruise at 
the helm, will most likely drain the blood out of even its most sanguine 
competitors, based on early word of mouth and studio tracking studies of viewer 
interest. Industry insiders predict an opening of at least $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In a distant third place over the weekend was "The War" with about $5.2 
million on 1,155 screens -- also the victim of poor critical response. That's 
only a hair ahead of the bellicose "Pulp Fiction," which was holding well with 
$5 million in its fourth weekend. Fortunately, there's no "three strikes" law 
for movie stars, because "The War" looks to be the the third Costner film in a 
row that has performed below expectations (the other two being "A Perfect 
World" and "Wyatt Earp"). Though he is not technically the star of the film 
(Wood is), he is a major character and featured prominently in the selling 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other new nationwide release, the kiddie action film "Double Dragon," 
did miserably with $1.3 million on 1,087 screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, according to John Krier of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks 
box-office sales, business appeared up slightly from the same weekend last 
year. And MGM/UA's Gleason was predicting Sunday that "Stargate" will settle in 
nicely through the holidays, having garnered almost $35 million in its first 10 
days. He said the film will likely surpass his initial $60-million overall 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some other fall releases continued to attract audiences, including 
the season leader to date, "The Specialist," with $3.1 million, "Love Affair" 
with $2.4 million and "The River Wild" with $2.1 million. "Little Giants" and 
"Forrest Gump" took in $2 million apiece. And 10th place in weekend ticket 
sales went to the fast-fading "The Road to Wellville" with $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Final weekend figures will be released today.

APPRECIATION; SAM FRANCIS: ON HIS OWN TERMS; THE ARTIST SILENTLY BROADCAST THE 
OBDURATE DESIRE TO BE REMEMBERED FOR HIS WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To be an artist in Los Angeles is to court an unusual kind of obscurity. Sam 
Francis, who died of cancer Saturday night at age 71, behaved as if he knew 
that. For three decades of cocktail parties, his name was trotted out along 
with a handful of others to give the lie to anyone accusing Angeltown of being 
a town without great painters. "Why, it is not. We have John McLaughlin, 
Richard Diebenkorn and (to deliver the coup de grace to the vulgar 
Lotusland-basher) Sam Francis . He is coming to this party, my party, and 
should arrive any minute." 
</P>
<P>
 This usually spiked the detractor, leaving him with a warm glow of 
anticipation. He was about to meet a great artist. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason Francis' name carried such weight was the quality of his fame. 
There is little point in being a famous Los Angeles painter in Los Angeles. 
What counts is to be a Los Angeles painter who is famous everywhere else. 
Francis was revered in New York, Tokyo and London. It didn't matter if he was 
invisible in his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 It was perhaps to prove this point that Francis often accepted invitations but 
virtually never appeared. His absence only made him the more memorable. He was 
the Godot of the Los Angeles art world. 
</P>
<P>
 His reasons for behaving in this fashion are enigmatic. For much of his adult 
life he looked robust, rather like a portly Caucasian Buddha, his baldness 
ringed with a fringe of long gray hair. He enjoyed the sybaritic life. He was 
married four times, at least twice to Japanese women. Why would such a man not 
come to the party? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it was his health. Serving in the Air Force in World War II, he 
sustained an injury that led to recurrent illness. Close friends confided that 
this strapping little man was in almost constant pain. That is a state not 
easily fathomed. 
</P>
<P>
 There are various contradictions. If he was notably stingy about giving his 
time to admirers and the press, who is to say that is not a wise thing for an 
artist to do? If he was generous with those close to him, his philanthropic 
foundations and gifts of art, who could deny that this too is wisdom? 
</P>
<P>
 It's possible to complicate these matters, but embedded within them is a 
great, Zen-like simplicity. This was a man who silently broadcast the obdurate 
desire to have what all artists say they want, which is to be remembered for 
their work. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Francis painted blobs. His was the kind of art Philistines of the Western 
world say their child could do better and the kind of art that Asian sages 
instantly recognize as possessed of superior enlightenment. It is exactly the 
right kind of art to make here in this sprawling border-town between the states 
of Far Eastern contemplation and Great Western impatience. 
</P>
<P>
 In history, Francis belongs to the often-mislaid second generation of Abstract 
Expressionists. Its denizens are almost all New York artists, such as Norman 
Bluhm and Grace Hartigan, whose reputations are still not properly focused. 
Francis, by contrast, rests in the mind along with giants of action painting 
such as De Kooning, Kline and Rothko. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference is a question of rationality. Their paintings clearly reveal 
structure that is either architectonic or atmospheric. Francis' painting also 
has structure but it is far more intuitive. This befits the kind of irrational 
spontaneity possible in the place they were made. It also bespeaks another of 
Francis' obdurate determinations. He really succeeded in avoiding another trap 
all artists wish to escape and rarely do. Aside from the inevitability of 
clearly belonging to his generation he is virtually unclassifiable. 
</P>
<P>
 When his detractors say his art never changed, looks all alike and is 
therefore merely decorative, they speak only of themselves. They say they are 
irritated at being unable to comfortably pigeonhole it. They say they have 
refused to look at it in its own terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis' art was driven by Far Eastern philosophy. It holds negative values to 
be positive. Francis often painted emptiness. Encountering depictions of the 
void can be terrifying for those whose own spirit lacks anything with which to 
fill it. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis' art was often celebratory like splashed bubbles and confetti, 
diaphanous, transparent and ephemeral. It is very difficult to write an art 
history Ph.D. thesis on this kind of joy. It is even more difficult to conjure 
with the notion that a festive shape in a Sam Francis painting could be a 
cancer cell as easily as a canape. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Francis knew how to attend the party without showing up. He had something 
to say to people that is especially relevant to this town. It is possible to 
exist in an uncomfortable physical place while living in a disembodied one that 
is more spacious, playful and profound.

 Stonewall, the Movie: The Stonewall riot of 1969 will be re-created complete 
with crowds, cops and drag queens beginning tonight in New York City as part of 
the filming of "Stonewall," a BBC movie about the incident at the Greenwich 
Village bar that was linked to the beginning of the gay rights movement. 
Production began two weeks ago on the film that tells the story of six gay men 
in New York in the days leading up to the riots. In addition to exploring the 
men's relationships, the film will recount the bloody rioting that occurred 
between gay men and police at the Stonewall Inn during the weekend Judy Garland 
was buried. But because the owner of the Stonewall would not allow film crews 
to shoot in front of the original bar in the Village's Sheridan Square, the 
pivotal riot scenes will be filmed nearby in a re-created square. The movie, 
directed by Nigel Finch and starring Guillermo Diaz, will have its U.S. 
theatrical release in mid-1995.

 Imitating Art: A Democratic candidate for Florida's Seminole County Commission 
is accusing his GOP challenger of stealing a speech from Dave Kovic -- the 
character portrayed by actor Kevin Klein in the movie "Dave." At issue is 
Kovic's movie quote: "I ought to care more about you than I do about me. I 
ought to care more about what's right than I do about what's popular. . . . 
Because if I'm not . . . then maybe I don't belong here in the first place." 
Republican candidate Win Adams reworded it a bit in speeches and a mailing, 
without noting its origin: "Elected officials ought to care more about you than 
they do about themselves. They ought to care more about what's right than 
what's popular. . . . Because if they don't, then maybe they don't belong in 
elected office in the first place." Rival candidate Larry Furlong called the 
use "borrowing at best, plagiarism at worst." Said Adams: "I saw something in a 
movie that made sense to me, so I used it. I think we're making a mountain out 
of a molehill." TELEVISION

 Letter From Lennon: It's like a slap in the face for Paul and Linda McCartney 
-- from the grave. A stinging six-page letter John Lennon purportedly wrote to 
the couple after the Beatles' split is up for auction. "I hope you realize what 
(expletive) you and the rest of my kind and unselfish friends laid on Yoko and 
me since we have been together," Lennon wrote. The undated letter was a 
response to a note from Linda that apparently chided Lennon for his biting 
interviews after the group's acrimonious 1970 break-up. "I don't resent your 
husband -- I'm sorry for him," Lennon wrote. The letter is expected to bring up 
to $60,000 at the Butterfield & Butterfield auction house Dec. 3. The owner's

COUNTERPUNCH : BY SAYING LITTLE, 'GUMP' SAYS MUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HALVORSON, Scott Halvorson teaches English at David Starr Jordan High 
School in Long Beach and is also at work on an enchanting collection of 
unproduced screenplays. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I know there's going to be trouble when a whimsical, fresh and delightful 
story is turned on its head by an earnest but wrongheaded thinker who seems to 
lack the basic element required to appreciate a movie like "Forrest Gump": a 
sense of wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 William Relling, in his attack on the popularity of "Forrest Gump" ("It's Time 
to Dump the 'Gump,' " Calendar, Oct. 17), misses the point when he criticizes 
Forrest for the way he "tosses off the assassinations of the Kennedys and 
Martin Luther King Jr. with nothing more than another of his flip 'Gump-isms.' 
" Understatement was a key technique in the film, a way of saying little and 
implying much. Forrest is not trying to be "flip" about Kennedy and King. He is 
simply being Forrest. Moreover, Forrest's brief words bring back the horror of 
those events more than another sermon about "violence in America" could ever 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 Relling criticizes the "casual, off-handed manner in which are treated the 
deaths of the two people Gump loves most: his mother . . . and his girlfriend, 
later-wife, Jenny." Again, it's understatement. A Lear-like outpouring of grief 
by Forrest would have stuck out of the picture like a titanic sore thumb. 
Sometimes less is more, powerfully so, and the quiet passing of Mrs. Gump and 
Jenny are all the more moving for the absence of third-rate pathos for which 
television dramas are infamous. 
</P>
<P>
 A related point is the fact that the "unknown disease" Jenny dies from is, 
almost assuredly, AIDS. It was an intelligent decision by the writer and 
director to let us figure this out for ourselves. We knew of Jenny's dangerous 
lifestyle. We know the time-frame. Thank God we weren't treated to another Dr. 
Generic dully explaining the disease to Forrest and us when there was no reason 
to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Forrest's quiet resignation in the face of suffering is precisely what is 
moving in the film. We know his feelings for his mother (who fought for his 
admission into a regular public school by making the ultimate sacrifice -- 
romancing an administrator), for his shrimping army buddy and for Jenny, who 
became his friend when no one else would. Tom Hanks should be commended for 
conveying the depth of Forrest's emotion without flashy set speeches. Any actor 
can tell you which is harder. By not getting or at least not appreciating the 
understated tone of the film, Relling missed the key part of its charm and 
poignancy. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, popular success is no guarantee of value. However, respect must 
always be paid to stories that strike so deep and resonant a chord in so many. 
To criticize "Forrest Gump" because it encourages a "lottery mentality" doesn't 
hold up under scrutiny, because Forrest actually works quite hard throughout 
the movie. He doesn't just sit around and expect great things to happen to him. 
</P>
<P>
 And it wouldn't matter if the film did encourage this alleged mentality. Some 
of the most enduring Greek myths are about capricious gods who casually reward 
undeserving mortals (Paris) and horribly punish good ones (Oedipus).  
</P>
<P>
 The enjoyment we receive from stories is not always or even usually for the 
correctness of their sociopolitical content; we delight in fresh characters and 
unexpected incidents. This is what "Forrest Gump" has, and why it has delighted 
so many.

COUNTERPUNCH : THE REAL BURT LANCASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES WASHBURN, Charles Washburn has worked in TV and motion picture 
production for 30 years. He is a member of the Directors Guild of America and 
Pacific Pioneer Broadcasters. He expects to make his feature film directing 
debut next year.

 Burt Lancaster was the first movie star I ever met. Hearing of his death 
caused me to reflect on our association, and prompted this writing. 
</P>
<P>
 The year was 1965. I was working in Nashville as a producer in religious 
broadcasting. While attending a TV writing workshop in Indianapolis, I met a 
Hollywood writer who saw talent in my writing and encouraged my dream of 
working in Hollywood as a writer-director. 
</P>
<P>
 The writer (John Bloch, who became one of the founders of a minority writers' 
program called "Open Door") confessed that mine would be an especially uphill 
battle because I was black. And Hollywood had not been particularly interested 
in opening its doors to the call of the civil rights movement, which was 
seeking changes all over the country. When he returned to Hollywood, John Bloch 
and I corresponded a lot. He'd answer my questions about Hollywood and even 
sent me pages from scripts to show me the form in which they were written. When 
I told him I'd be coming to Los Angeles, he sent me the names and agents' 
addresses of two Hollywood stars -- one was Lancaster. Bloch reasoned that 
since they had been so active in the marches and other areas of the civil 
rights movement, they might use their influence and help open a door for me. I 
wrote to both. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster answered my letter. I read his reply on his personal stationery with 
his signature over and over. This was the guy who, as a 10- or 11-year-old, I 
saw in the film "Brute Force." My childhood buddy and I used to re-enact the 
scene in that prison picture in which he gets shot in the back, yells out loud, 
spins around and, with machine gun in hand, wipes out the perpetrator. We each 
took turns playing that scene -- usually with a sawed-off broomstick as the 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
 When I arrived in Los Angeles, I called the studio where Lancaster had his 
office. His secretary took my name and number and promised he would call me 
back. He did. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd have recognized that voice anywhere. I still remember, in his careful 
directions how to get to his office, the way he pronounced "La Brea." It was 
"La Bre-ah-h" coming from that famous voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving at the studio, I was led by his secretary into his massive private 
office. I met and talked with him, and he made me feel very much at ease. I do 
remember that he had the bluest eyes I had ever seen. He allowed me to talk 
about my writing and directing background (live TV and stage plays), and 
promised to make some calls in my behalf, and would call me back with the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, he kept his word. But he seemed disappointed with his findings. No one 
he called was willing to meet with the Negro kid he had taken an interest in. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years later, after I had entered Hollywood through a training program 
for assistant directors, I wrote him and sent a copy of a Directors Guild 
magazine that featured me in a lengthy article. In the late '80s, I attended a 
screening of two of his films at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's Bing 
Theater. I didn't realize he was sitting behind me until the second film ("The 
Crimson Pirate") was over and he was called onstage to speak. When all the 
speeches and questions and answers ended and the audience filed out, I headed 
straight for him and became a part of his entourage. We were herded into an 
elevator that headed for the basement. 
</P>
<P>
 As we wound our way through the unfamiliar lower corridors that led to a 
secured parking area, Burt and I walked and talked while being led and 
surrounded by his hosts and security people. He told me he was headed for 
Mexico and how to reach his Century City office to leave a message. 
</P>
<P>
 The film he was to do must have been "Old Gringo." I later learned that 
because of his health, he didn't do the picture. We never talked after that 
meeting, but I still have his 1965 letter and memories of a movie hero who 
cared.

COUNTERPUNCH : ROSENBERG ERRS IN PBS CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERVIN S. DUGGAN, Ervin S. Duggan is president of PBS, the Public 
Broadcasting Service, based in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a recent column, The Times' redoubtable critic, Howard Rosenberg, deplored 
an educational game show on public television ("A 'Masterpiece' It Isn't," 
Calendar, Oct. 10). It's certainly his right to criticize. He should know, 
however, that the program, "Think Twice," is an experiment -- to test, among 
other things, shorter program lengths in our schedule. If "Think Twice" doesn't 
work, or if it fails to comport with the serious mission of public television, 
viewers can be sure that PBS and its member stations will take appropriate 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg errs badly, however, when he extrapolates, from one program he 
doesn't like to a general trend toward mediocrity in public television. His 
conclusion is doubly puzzling, considering that he likes so many of our 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 He lists "Prime Suspect," "The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour," "Frontline," 
"P.O.V.," "National Geographic's China: Beyond the Clouds," "FDR" and "The 
Civil War," for example, as emblems of our excellence. He also compliments our 
upcoming "Democracy Project," a comprehensive effort to enrich our news, 
analysis and public affairs programming in time for the 1996 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 We appreciate the positive attention Rosenberg has paid to public TV in the 
past. We believe that it's quite a stretch, however, to cite a half-hour 
program as evidence of a general down slide. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg takes us to task for two programs we chose not to fund and 
distribute, citing these as missed opportunities to provide good programming. 
In our judgment, these decisions -- about which reasonable people, of course, 
can disagree -- demonstrate something else: that PBS is capable of making tough 
editorial decisions without bending to outside pressure, of which there is 
always plenty.  
</P>
<P>
 In the case of a "Tales of the City" sequel, we stuck to our decision in the 
face of much public pressure after determining that the price tag was out of 
reach for PBS. In the case of "Rights & Wrongs," our programming professionals 
judged that that series did not treat the issues of human rights as skillfully 
as its producers believed they had. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg's baleful view of public television did not reach beyond our 
prime-time programs, and that's understandable; he's a TV critic. Viewers 
should know, however, that PBS and public TV are busy during other parts of the 
day and in ways that are not always visible on the screen -- namely, in a wide 
range of educational and technological activities. 
</P>
<P>
 PBS is the nation's leading provider of video programming for kindergarten 
through 12th-grade classrooms, and the largest source of college telecourses in 
the world. Our programs reach 30 million students and nearly 2 million 
teachers. More than 325,000 adults a year take PBS college-credit telecourses. 
None of the commercial channels Rosenberg mentions as duplicating PBS' efforts 
comes close to this dedication to education. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 PBS provides "PTV, the Ready to Learn Service" to stations to further the 
national education goal of helping young citizens enter school with some basic 
skills in place. Other initiatives include "Going the Distance," which allows 
students, for the first time, to earn an associate of arts degree from 60 
colleges by taking, at home, telecourses developed by public television, and 
"PBS Mathline," to help teach greater proficiency in math.  
</P>
<P>
 Beyond these services to formal education, we at PBS are focusing on new 
services to the public through technology -- especially to poor people, people 
in remote areas and others with special needs. We've become a pioneer in 
digital television technology, and we're determined to be at the forefront of 
educational multimedia. The information superhighway, in short, is something we 
helped invent. 
</P>
<P>
 Like any nonprofit organization, PBS faces a chronic money shortage. But we 
manage to deliver a high level of quality year in and year out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The entire budget for public television -- public and private money -- is less 
than Fox Broadcasting paid for the rights to broadcast NFL football alone! Our 
federal support amounts to less than $1 per person annually in tax money -- a 
bargain by any standard. We use each of those dollars to call forth four or 
five other dollars from private givers, corporations and foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 We at PBS will, of course, make occasional mistakes. And certainly not every 
PBS program will please every critic or viewer. But the real trend in public 
television will always be toward excellence. Your local public library may have 
a clunkhead book or two on its shelves. But the institution is still valuable 
-- a signal of our public commitment to learning. The same is true of public 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 One swallow doesn't make a spring, and one program doesn't necessarily 
constitute a trend.

REAGAN DRAWS PRAISE FOR DISCLOSURE; ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE: AT HIS CHURCH AND HIS 
LIBRARY, PEOPLE LAUD HIS CANDOR AND STRENGTH. L.A. OFFICE OF SUPPORT 
ORGANIZATION FOR THE ILLNESS IS FLOODED WITH CALLS. 
</P>

<P>
 Worshipers at Ronald and Nancy Reagan's church in Bel-Air said a prayer for 
the former President and his family. Visitors flocked to the Reagan library 
near Simi Valley in unusually high numbers, talking about Reagan the man rather 
than his politics. And the Los Angeles office of the Alzheimer's Assn. was 
flooded by calls from across the country as Alzheimer's disease officially 
entered the national spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 A day after Reagan's disclosure that he is in the early stages of the disease, 
people across the Southland marveled at his gutsiness in going public with his 
ailment. 
</P>
<P>
 At Bel Air Presbyterian Church, the Rev. Carolyn Crawford led worshipers in 
asking for divine help "so that he will show courage and continue to be an 
example." 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,000-member congregation has included the Reagans since 1965, but the 
couple were reported out of town and not in attendance at Sunday's services. 
</P>
<P>
 Congregant Wilma Sallman, 75, said she was glad Reagan had come forward with 
his sickness. "He's always been upfront," she said. "He tells it like it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Frances Moore speculated that Reagan announced his ailment "in self-defense" 
to fend off rumors and possible media leaks. Eventually, she noted, "the 
disease gives itself away." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, visitors remembered the former 
President's vitality as a public man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met him about a year ago down in Century City and he was still full of 
one-liners," said Hal Everett, a retired salesman from Thousand Oaks who worked 
as a volunteer at the library for three years. "At the time he seemed to be 
very healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has slowed down over the years and he doesn't come up here as much as he 
used to, but when I met him he was still very sharp," said Everett, 72. "I'd 
have voted for him again this year if he'd run." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Everson brought his friend Bjorn Sandvik of Norway to the Reagan 
library to see the videotape of Reagan's challenge to then-Soviet leader 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a Democrat and did not agree with him in many issues," said Everson, a 
religious studies professor at Cal Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks. "But 
his place in history is secure." 
</P>
<P>
 Another visitor, Lee Sudman, a retired furniture salesman from Tarzana, 
questioned Reagan's own assessment that he was now in "the sunset of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy's got plenty of stamina," Sudman said. "This isn't going to kill him. 
He's a strong guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Braun, executive director of the Los Angeles chapter of the Alzheimer's 
Assn., said people with loved ones who have Alzheimer's disease had inundated 
the office with calls, spurred to ask for help by Reagan's disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 He called Reagan's announcement "a transforming moment for the cause" and said 
he expected it to help increase awareness of the disease as well as funding for 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alzheimer's Assn., Braun said, will soon begin "developing a very 
aggressive and impressive public relations campaign" to educate the public 
about Alzheimer's disease. But Sunday, he said, his office was busy dealing 
with media inquiries and calls.

3 SLAIN AT TOPLESS BAR AS OUSTED MAN RETURNS WITH GUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. LOPEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A gunman, apparently angry because he was thrown out of a topless bar, 
returned early Sunday morning and fired on startled patrons and employees, 
killing two people and wounding two others before he was shot dead by a club 
security guard. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman had "vowed to return and shoot the employees" when he and a friend 
were told to leave the 1st King topless bar in Gardena after they tried to 
visit a dancer in her dressing room, Gardena police said. The two men returned 
two hours later, about 1:30 a.m., Officer Joe Prado said, and one of them shot 
two security guards at the front door of the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman then walked inside the packed club and fired his semiautomatic 
handgun at patrons and employees, who dove on the floor and ducked under 
tables, Prado said. The man was killed by one of the guards he had wounded 
moments earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were searching for the gunman's friend Sunday after he reportedly fled 
in a car. Names of the gunman and the others killed, a customer and one of the 
guards, were not released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other topless and striptease clubs, the 1st King bar is often frequented 
by tough customers, employees said. To prevent trouble, the bar has a metal 
detector at the front door, armed security guards and bouncers. 
</P>
<P>
 The white brick building at 14401 S. Western Ave. was closed Sunday. But 
grisly reminders of the crime were evident: a dried puddle of blood at the 
front door, where the guards were shot; 16 chalk circles drawn by detectives, 
where bullet casings had littered the sidewalk and parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said witnesses described the shooter and his friend as gang members. 
The two reportedly tried to force their way into a dressing room backstage. 
</P>
<P>
 Yolanda Moore, 25, who has worked at the bar for five years and goes by the 
stage name of Yo Yo, said the club's daytime clientele consists of 
professionals who stop by to drink beer and eat hamburgers. But at night, she 
and customers said, the establishment is a hangout for local gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men were thrown out of the club by one of the bouncers and began to 
make threats. "They vowed to return and shoot the employees," Prado said. "They 
apparently meant it." 
</P>
<P>
 After shooting the two guards at the door, police said, the gunman walked 
through the metal detector and apparently began firing indiscriminately. One of 
the guards, who had been hit in the leg, chased the gunman inside and fatally 
wounded him. The gunman was pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The other security guard, along with one of the customers, died a short while 
later at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, authorities said. A dancer and the wounded 
guard were reported in stable condition with gunshot wounds at Memorial 
Hospital in Gardena.

ITO WEIGHS POSSIBLE TV CAMERA BAN TODAY; SIMPSON CASE: FEW JOURNALISTS THINK 
JUDGE WILL FOLLOW THROUGH ON THREAT TO OUST COVERAGE FROM HIS COURT. BUT MEDIA 
LAWYERS WILL BE OUT IN FORCE TO ARGUE THEIR CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito opens scheduled hearings this morning 
in the O.J. Simpson double murder case, he will take up an issue that has been 
on the back burner for weeks: whether he should end courtroom television 
coverage of the most publicized criminal case in recent American jurisprudence. 
</P>
<P>
 While few journalists think the judge will follow through with his threat to 
ban the single television camera that provides live images from the Simpson 
case to scores of broadcast outlets, no one is taking a chance; news media and 
civil liberties lawyers will be out in force today to argue against the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a dozen news organizations, including The Times, have filed joint or 
separate written arguments against what they view as an unfair, misdirected 
attempt by Ito to deal with his frustrations over inaccurate or improper 
reporting by some television stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining with them are legal scholars, journalism associations, broadcast and 
print trade groups and an Arizona-based coalition that fights to protect 
constitutional freedoms of speech and the press. 
</P>
<P>
 And the American Civil Liberties Union has filed a so-called "friend of the 
court" brief in hopes of dissuading Ito from banning the camera, which is 
operated by Court TV. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-court cable network has provided its viewers -- and viewers of other 
TV outlets -- with live, gavel-to-gavel coverage of almost all the Simpson 
proceedings except jury selection, which by court rules cannot be broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever problems have arisen regarding certain media reports in the case do 
not relate to the issues of televising the actual courtroom proceedings," the 
ACLU wrote in its brief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Indeed the surest antidote to misinformation about this case is courtroom 
audio and video that allows the public to hear and see what is happening as it 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Arenella, a UCLA law professor who joined the ACLU's brief, argues that 
the broadcast blackout would fail to lessen the "intense media glare" 
surrounding the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, he said, it would only increase the chances of inaccurate or 
irresponsible stories by reporters desperate for a competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, in a television interview taped Sunday after a campaign 
appearance in Seattle, said he was "troubled" by the amount of pretrial 
publicity and, in particular, by the televising of the pretrial proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been better if they (pretrial hearings) hadn't" been televised, 
Clinton said in an interview with CNN's Larry King, who had asked the President 
if he thought Simpson could receive a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Televising the trial itself would pose less of a problem because the jury has 
already been chosen, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there can be a fair trial, but it's much more difficult to impanel a 
jury" because of the publicity, said Clinton, who once served as Arkansas' 
attorney general. "There's never been anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although jurors have been questioned about putting aside what they already 
know about the case, "we can't help being affected by the things we know," 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's remarks on the case were unusual. Presidents generally do not 
comment on pending trials to avoid the possibility of inadvertently influencing 
jurors. President Nixon drew headlines when he declared Charles Manson guilty 
during that trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also praised both the defense attorneys and prosecutors, as well as 
the judge, saying he thinks Ito has been "firm and fair." 
</P>
<P>
 "He has an enormously difficult task," Clinton added. "It's a very sad case. 
It's the sort of thing that brings great pain to the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito first made his threat to exclude the camera in late September, three days 
before jury selection began. The threat came after local television station 
KNBC Channel 4 reported and then stood by its story that a pair of socks 
retrieved from Simpson's bedroom had been subjected to DNA tests at a Maryland 
laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 The KNBC report asserted that test results pointed to Simpson's ex-wife Nicole 
Brown Simpson as the source of blood found on the socks, a clear -- and 
unproven -- implication that Simpson had been at the murder scene outside his 
ex-wife's condominium in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The station later acknowledged that at least some information provided by its 
sources had been inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito felt the KNBC report had the potential of prejudicing a jury against the 
former football great, who has pleaded not guilty in the June 12 deaths of his 
ex-wife and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito was joined in that conclusion by both the defense and the prosecution, 
which contended that its credibility was being eroded. 
</P>
<P>
 But the matter seemed to have been forgotten until Oct. 3, when Ito learned 
that local television stations had, against court rules, aired footage from 
inside the courthouse that showed the faces of jurors sitting on cases other 
than Simpson's. 
</P>
<P>
 And a few days earlier, the judge had been rankled to read in the Daily News, 
a San Fernando Valley-based newspaper, the contents of juror questionnaires 
before he had officially made those documents public. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court proposes to terminate film and electronic coverage" of the trial, 
Ito wrote in a tersely worded order distributed to Steven Brill, president of 
Court TV, and other news organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also abruptly ordered out of the courthouse the same cameras he had 
allowed in the hallway outside his courtroom, where some footage of the 
non-Simpson jurors had been shot. 
</P>
<P>
 He then scheduled the hearing that is set for today. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, judges are allowed to bar cameras from their courtrooms if they 
decide their presence threatens the dignity or orderly performance of the 
proceedings, or a defendant's right to a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But pulling the plug on the courtroom camera in the Simpson case would destroy 
elaborate arrangements by broadcast news organizations to cover a trial for 
which they seem to have an insatiable appetite. 
</P>
<P>
 If Ito follows through, "I don't know how the trial would be covered," Carolyn 
Fox told The Times last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox is executive director of the Radio and Television News Assn., the Southern 
California group coordinating broadcast coverage of the trial.

STREET SMART / RICHARD SIMON: SO, WHERE'S THE WIENERMOBILE?

 When you visit the Petersen Automotive Museum, don't waste your time looking 
for county supervisors' bulletproof cars -- you know, the ones equipped with 
trunks rigged with hidden escape buttons in case kidnapers try to stash their 
victims there. 
</P>
<P>
 Or the Mercedes smashed in by golf club-wielding actor Jack Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
 Or the world's fastest Hyundai -- the one driven by Rodney King. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum, which opened in June at Wilshire Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue, is 
supposed to depict how The Car shaped The City -- for better or worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're about is the history of the automobile and its impact on American 
life and culture using Los Angeles as the prime example," said Matt Roth, the 
museum's curator. 
</P>
<P>
 On a certain formal level, it does deliver. There's the 1984 Buick used to 
pace the torch relay leading up to the Los Angeles Coliseum and the opening of 
the Olympics. And a three-wheeled Dale built by a transsexual con artist from 
the San Fernando Valley. And there are lowriders. 
</P>
<P>
 James Bond's Aston Martin is garaged there. It has a few things that the 
county supervisors' cars don't, such as machine guns, tire-slashing wheels, a 
smoke screen and oil-slick delivery system, and an ejector seat. (Yeah, but 
007's car doesn't have the feature that some of the supervisors' cars have -- 
an intercom that allows passengers to talk to outsiders while seated safely 
inside.) 
</P>
<P>
 Cars are exhibited among such things as a strip mall, a drive-in restaurant 
and a replica of the Dog Cafe, which once stood on Washington Boulevard in 
Culver City. The exhibits are designed to show how cars influenced life in 
Southern California and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 This is, after all, the place where for $20,000 you can have your face 
sculpted on a mannequin of a gas station attendant or car salesman. Seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there's part of Los Angeles' soul missing from this latest and very 
Angeleno addition to the County Museum of Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the problem is that they didn't ask the public for suggestions on how to 
illustrate our peculiar relationship with our cars. 
</P>
<P>
 So don't expect to find a couple necking on Mulholland Drive. Or a sculpture 
of a carjacking. Or drivers applying makeup or jabbering on a cellular phone 
while speeding down PCH in their Beamer. 
</P>
<P>
 If this place was supposed to show how the internal combustion engine shaped 
life in L.A., here are some vehicles that might be there: 
</P>
<P>
 * The LAPD's battering-ram-equipped tank. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Quakey Shake Van. That's the one that travels to schools and simulates a 
5.6-magnitude earthquake to teach kids about life on the Fault Zone. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Humvee, like the ones that roamed the streets after the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 * The 1955 Buick convertible featured in Randy Newman's "I Love L.A." video. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Rolls-Royce that Zsa Zsa Gabor was driving when she slapped a cop. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Wienermobile. Its driver once said: "I relish this job, but to keep it, 
you have to cut the mustard." 
</P>
<P>
 * The dichondra car. Built by the Dichondra Weed and Feed people for an ad 
campaign, it was bought by a mushroom grower who soon discovered it had 
disadvantages: It had to be clipped with hedge shears. It had to be watered 
daily. It attracted dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Edward Kienholz's "Back Seat Dodge -- '38." The artwork, which depicts a 
couple in the car's back seat in, let's say, amorous embrace, set off an 
art-versus-morality controversy in the '60s. County supervisors sought to 
remove the "revolting . . . and pornographic exhibition" from the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art. Ultimately, the supervisors agreed to a compromise -- the 
door to the car would be closed to visitors age 18 and younger -- unless they 
had parental consent. 
</P>
<P>
 * And let's not forget the latest addition: O.J.'s white Ford Bronco. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles isn't just home to the cars that made this place famous; it's home 
to the car-men. 
</P>
<P>
 Where are the statues of famous auto pitchmen? Ralph Williams, lying Joe Isuzu 
and Cal Worthington -- accompanied, of course, by his menagerie of animals, all 
named Spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The vanished, fabled trolley cars are there -- in an exhibit that reproduces a 
scene from Laurel and Hardy's "Hog Wild" showing the comedians trapped in their 
crushed Model T between two trolley cars. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Petersen ought to include an exhibit on the Great Southern California 
Automobile Conspiracy theory. That's the one where it is said that General 
Motors, Standard Oil of California and Firestone Tire and Rubber got together 
to force the car culture on a city that had been happily dependent on a vast 
and efficient system of public transit. 
</P>
<P>
 The theory is still hotly argued, but is countered with evidence that the 
public began forsaking the streetcars long before GM and its partners took 
apart the Pacific Electric Co. in the 1950s. Scholars point out that Pacific 
Electric was losing money and patronage as early as 1930. They blame the 
streetcar's fading popularity on rising fares, poor maintenance and the 
region's love affair with the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't look for an exhibit on famous lemons either. This museum is looking to 
the car makers for financial support.

FEMALE VOLLEYBALL STARS PLAY IN FEAR; HARASSMENT BY OBSESSED MALE FANS GROWS AS 
BEACH SPORT GAINS POPULARITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For almost a decade Elaine Roque has enjoyed star status in the fast-growing 
professional sport of women's beach volleyball. It has brought her an annual 
income of nearly six figures, trips abroad, keen competition -- and constant 
fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Roque keeps a baseball bat under her bed, in her car and at the office. And 
she frequently travels with a security escort. They're a necessary response, 
she says, to the disturbing stream of visits, letters and phone calls she 
receives from obsessed male fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Roque is not alone. Many female beach volleyball players report a steady 
increase in harassment by overzealous men. The trend, the sport's experts say, 
is eroding what is left of the casual and funky atmosphere that has helped pro 
beach volleyball thrive. 
</P>
<P>
 For spectators, part of the sport's allure is its accessibility. Players walk 
over beach towels to get to the court, dive into the crowd for loose balls and 
often take breaks only an arm's length from fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of them are attractive, athletic and are wearing designer swimwear. They 
play on a public beach in a small and intimate setting. . . . People are 
attracted to that," said David Kraft, managing editor of Volleyball Monthly, 
one of the sport's leading trade magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 Roque's problems started even before she turned pro. While she was on the UCLA 
volleyball team, a fellow college student attended all of her classes and 
filled a photo album with pictures of her competing. Then there was the fan who 
followed her from California to an Olympic training center in Utah. And last 
year, when she was competing professionally, there was the hulking man who 
presented her with a three-page love letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can understand the drawbacks in this sport, having a bad day or suffering a 
devastating loss," said Roque. "But growing up playing volleyball, I never 
thought I'd ever have to worry about fans or anything like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Many attribute the problem to the sport's growing popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s and '70s, when players were barely earning enough to cover their 
travel expenses, beach volleyball was more akin to a cult, with a few hundred 
die-hard fans traveling to Southland beaches to watch a few top players compete 
in informal weekend matches. Spectators were encouraged to bring their beach 
chairs to the court's edge and cheer along, point by point, with their favorite 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, crowds of 20,000 attend many tournaments, which are backed by large 
sponsors such as Coors, Reebok and Chevrolet. Court-side seats cost $10. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a summer sport and confined largely to California, the men's and women's 
pro beach tour is now year-round and stops all over the world. The game will be 
an Olympic event in Atlanta in 1996. CBS, NBC and Prime Ticket, a regional 
sports channel, regularly televise events, expanding the sport's popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous televised interviews at court side allow players to develop distinct 
public personalities, and many of the game's top women players are encouraged 
by their sponsors to remain accessible and project a friendly persona. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days you might have 100 people and one wacko," said Kraft. "Now, 
with a million watching, you've got dozens of wackos. There's a line that's 
being defined right now between allowing the players to mingle with fans and 
the need to protect them." 
</P>
<P>
 A year and a half ago the Women's Professional Volleyball Assn., a primary 
sponsoring organization, increased security measures by adding extra police and 
security staff at each tournament and creating a special players-only tent that 
is cordoned off. 
</P>
<P>
 Female players now speak knowingly of a wide range of harassment: Lewd 
questions and comments directed at them during autograph sessions. Strangers 
who show up at their houses with presents on Christmas Day. Promoters seeking 
partners in marketing scams. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The other member of Roque's two-woman team, Gail Castro, once had a fan 
befriend her elderly parents during a tournament. After finding out about the 
family's dinner plans, the fan showed up uninvited at a buffet meal. The group 
was unable to get rid of the voluble guest and ended up paying his bill, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes a string of small incidents can prove burdensome. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, Karolyn Kirby, one of Roque's chief competitors on the tour, 
received a deluge of anonymous phone calls that recently ended when police 
captured the culprit. During that time, someone broke into her house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's every little thing that compounds the problem. You just don't feel safe 
anymore," Kirby said. "You think, 'Is it someone across the street looking 
through the window?' Your mind just goes and takes on all scenarios." 
</P>
<P>
 Roque knows the feeling all too well. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, she said, one man appeared at all of her tournaments in 
California, where he continually tried to talk to her. Another man, after 
watching her compete on television, peppered her with phone calls and tried to 
arrange a meeting through the college where she teaches. (She described the man 
as a former high-ranking federal government official but declined to identify 
him.) A California millionaire incessantly sought an encounter on the pretext 
of employing Roque at his company. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 1993, at a tournament in Santa Cruz, Roque came face to face with a 
6-foot-4, 280-pound man who had followed her on the tour for nearly five years. 
Without talking, the man handed her a three-page, single-spaced typed letter 
entitled "Ode to Elaine," a collage of weird fantasies involving the man and 
Roque. 
</P>
<P>
 He then sat court-side to watch her compete. In the middle of the match, Roque 
called a timeout and broke down, sobbing. Months of letters and phone calls 
from this and other men -- and the security precautions she was forced to take 
-- had taken a psychic toll. She managed to return to the court and finish the 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 Roque turned the letter over to the FBI. Soon after, she said, she obtained a 
court restraining order against the man that prohibited him from coming closer 
than 400 yards to her or the college where she teaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even now, I still double-check my (car) mirror. I'm always scared," said 
Roque, who has never been attacked physically. "It really makes you think twice 
about people." 
</P>
<P>
 Roque has an unlisted address and phone number and screens all her calls. 
Though unmarried, she always wears a wedding ring. She lives in a guarded 
community with a dog, and has begun taking classes in kick boxing and other 
forms of self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 She says she and other female beach volleyball players have no choice but to 
deal with the changing climate of their sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always tried to be open, friendly and honest," said Roque. "But it 
doesn't always pay. It might have gotten me into trouble."

TRAIN DERAILS IN CITY OF INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 40 or 50 double-stacked containers of a mile-long freight train derailed 
Sunday night along Valley Boulevard in the City of Industry, but no injuries or 
spills were initially reported, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were cars crumpling up and falling over. Everything was twisted," said 
Deneen Rincon, who was driving on Valley when she saw the derailment. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the engine went off the tracks, and other cars smashed into the front 
of the train and toppled off.

MIKE DOWNEY: JUST IN CASE WHISTLES PUT YOU TO SLEEP

 For everyone who missed Sunday night's 13-3 defeat to the Kansas City Chiefs 
because their televisions were tuned to "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" 
(mistakenly expecting it to be the George Foreman story), here is a complete 
rundown of 60 minutes of unforgettable Raider football: 
</P>
<P>
 (Or, to quote winning quarterback Joe Montana: "Fortunately, we made one big 
play, which is one more than they did.") 
</P>
<P>
 -- Throw ball to Tim Brown. Intercepted. Give ball to Harvey Williams. Give 
ball to Williams. Throw ball to Brown. Penalty on Raiders. Jeff Hostetler runs 
for his life. Punt. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give ball to Williams. Give ball to Williams. Throw ball to Williams. 
Hostetler runs for his life. Give ball to Williams. Penalty on Raiders. Throw 
ball to Brown. Give ball to Williams. Punt. Penalty on Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give ball to Williams. Throw ball to somebody else! (Tom Rathman). Give 
ball to Williams. End of quarter. Throw to somebody else! (Andrew Glover). 
Throw to Brown. Give ball to Williams. Give ball to Williams. Throw ball to 
Brown. Penalty on Raiders. Two passes to somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give ball to Williams. Give ball to Williams. Give ball to Williams. Throw 
ball to Brown. Penalty on Raiders. Miss field goal. Penalty on Raiders. Penalty 
on Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Throw ball to Brown. Give ball to Williams. Give ball to Williams. Throw 
ball to Brown. Throw to somebody else! (Alexander Wright). Give ball to 
Williams. Penalty on Raiders. Throw ball to somebody else! (Glover). Penalty on 
Raiders. Throw ball to Brown. Make field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give ball to Williams. Give to Williams. Throw to Brown. Give to Williams. 
Give to Williams. Punt. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Throw to Brown. Give to Williams. Throw to Brown. Give to Williams. 
Hostetler runs for life. Throw to Brown. Penalty on Raiders. Throw to Brown. 
Offsetting penalties. Punt. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Throw to somebody else (Rocket Ismail). Give to Williams. Hostetler runs 
for life. Miss field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Throw to Brown. Give to Williams. Throw to Brown. Punt. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Throw to somebody else (Glover). Give to Williams. Throw to Brown. Throw to 
somebody else (Glover). Throw to Brown. Punt. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Throw to Williams. Throw to Williams. Hostetler runs for life. Punt. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Throw to Brown. Throw to Brown. Penalty on Raiders. Penalty on Raiders. 
Throw to Williams. Throw to Williams. Throw to Brown. Throw to somebody else 
(Glover). Penalty on Raiders. Throw twice to somebody else (Calvin Jones and 
Glover). Hostetler runs for life. Fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Throw to Williams. Throw to Brown. Throw to somebody else (Ismail). Throw 
to Brown. Intercepted. Game over. 
</P>
<P>
 Bore you? 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen yards for boring is the only penalty the Raiders didn't get. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were an awful lot of penalties. We had motion penalties. We had 
entirely too many holding penalties," said the coach of these guilty parties, 
Art Shell, who had better start reteaching these people the rules or 
threatening them with stiff fines. 
</P>
<P>
 This team has more flags than the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 False start on Chester McGlockton. False start on Greg Skrepenak. Another 
false start on Skrepenak. Face mask on James Trapp. False start on Ismail. 
False start on Kevin Gogan. Unsportsmanlike conduct on Gogan. Offside on 
Winston Moss. False start on Raider line. False start on Robert Jenkins. 
Offside on Albert Lewis. False start on Jenkins again. Unsportsmanlike conduct 
on Skrepenak. Holding on Steve Wisniewski. False start on Skrepenak again. 
Illegal motion on unidentified player. Unsportsmanlike conduct on "Raider 
bench." 
</P>
<P>
 Flags, flags, flags. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem wasn't the Chiefs. The problem was the handkerchiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, every time Neil Smith of the Chiefs inched, some Raider flinched. 
</P>
<P>
 Skrepenak: "The new rule is, if he entices you to move, then the foul is on 
the defense. But I quickly learned that he has to cross the neutral zone." 
</P>
<P>
 I don't care if he crosses into the dead zone, the ozone or the white zone at 
LAX for immediate loading or unloading, this false-start nonsense has got to 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
 And what is with this Raider offense, anyway? When did Hostetler start 
ditching the ball right into the paws of opposing players, or carrying it with 
one hand until he gets stripped from behind? And must he look for Brown or 
Williams on play after play? Only one pass to Ismail? (Incomplete). One pass to 
Wright? (Incomplete). Are these guys covered or invisible or what? 
</P>
<P>
 Wright is a starter. I mean, this man starts for an NFL club at wide receiver. 
Know how many catches Wright has? Seven. Seven in nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 Ismail has 16. That is not even two a week. The late, great James Jett has 
five. The forgotten Daryl Hobbs has five. Remember them from the exhibition 
season? Apparently, that was the last time either was open. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the National Football League, and nothin' happens easy in this 
league. Nothin'!" exclaimed Coach Marty Schottenheimer, big chief of Arrowhead 
Stadium, doing his always popular Tina Turner impression. 
</P>
<P>
 Save the Lombardi bull, Marty. The Raiders have been beaten seven consecutive 
times in Kansas City. They play at Arrowhead like they have arrows in their 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody blow a whistle. This whole season has been one big false start.

FOREMAN THE MAN OF THE BIG MOMENT; BOXING: AFTER ONE OF SPORTS' GREATEST 
VICTORIES, WHAT CAN HE POSSIBLY DO FOR AN ENCORE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They sifted through history Sunday, with a clap of thunder still echoing in 
their ears. 
</P>
<P>
 What has George Foreman wrought? 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing less than a moment the sports world will forever use as a historical 
flashpoint, according to many who witnessed his startling one-punch 10th-round 
knockout of Michael Moorer on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Bobby Thomson's pennant-winning home run or Willie Mays' World Series 
catch or the U.S. hockey team's Olympic miracle in previous eras, when you 
remember the 1990s, they said, you will remember the landmark 10 seconds that 
made 45-year-old Foreman the oldest heavyweight champion ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years ago, Foreman was the victim of Muhammad Ali making his own mark 
on history. Saturday night, donning the old velour red trunks he wore when Ali 
rope-a-doped him to shocking defeat, Foreman closed the circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was something that all of you who follow the sport will never forget," 
said Bob Arum, Foreman's promoter. "It'll go down in history comparable to when 
Ali knocked George down in Zaire 20 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what his future holds -- and at this point, who's going to guess? -- 
all that mattered Sunday was the short, twisting, concussive right hand 
Foreman, trailing on all cards, fired into Moorer's chin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the most significant punch landed in heavyweight history," said 
veteran boxing observer and trainer Gil Clancy. "That's my opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 Said trainer Lou Duva, who is associated with Moorer's camp: "The only thing I 
can compare it to in my 50 years of boxing was when Rocky Marciano was losing 
in the 13th round, and he needed to win and he knocked out Jersey Joe Walcott 
(on Sept. 23, 1952). 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the right hand heard 'round the world. And this was all of that. 
This was like Joe Namath's Super Bowl guarantee, like Bobby Thomson." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelo Dundee, who was Ali's trainer 20 years ago and has worked Foreman's 
corner for three years, said he was never concerned that Foreman was in trouble 
despite Moorer's repeated pounding on Foreman's face. 
</P>
<P>
 Dundee, who had to keep pulling up Foreman's old shorts between rounds because 
the elastic was well worn out, said he knew Foreman was setting up Moorer by 
throwing hard left jabs to make Moorer overconcerned with the left. 
</P>
<P>
 But he did warn Foreman before the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said you only have nine minutes left and you're losing on the scorecards," 
Dundee said. "I said you better knock this kid out quick." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Moorer corner, trainer Teddy Atlas was clearly concerned that his 
26-year-old fighter was leaving himself open to what Atlas called "a sneaky 
right hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer, though he said he tried to circle harder to his right, never could 
make the adjustment. Soon, after absorbing a couple of rights early in the 
round, Moorer was raked with a glancing left, then the bomb that gave Foreman 
the 68th knockout of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer's head flew back so quickly, his body seemed to pause for a moment, his 
legs and hips caught in the back-first crumple to the canvas. Moorer's head 
snapped against the floor, raised at the count of three, but he never made a 
real attempt to get to his feet. 
</P>
<P>
 When his corner removed his mouthpiece after the knockout, blood streamed out 
of Moorer's nose. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other guy did the unforgivable sin against George," Dundee said. "He bent 
down. When you bend down against George, you're in big, big trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "George used that chop right hand, and he's putting 250 pounds behind it. 
What's in front of it has gotta go down." 
</P>
<P>
 For Arum, who has been waging war with boxing's three major governing 
organizations for years and had to successfully sue to keep this fight alive 
after the World Boxing Assn. refused to sanction it, Foreman's victory and 
status as both the sport's most popular person and its most dramatic champion 
is a chance to cleanse boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Arum said that if Foreman wants to continue fighting -- no 
guarantee -- Tommy Morrison would be a natural to be the first challenger 
because Morrison defeated Foreman 17 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And Arum said a Foreman-Mike Tyson bout would be "the fight to end all 
fights." 
</P>
<P>
 One man definitely not on any short lists: Larry Holmes, 45, who is 
challenging World Boxing Council champion Oliver McCall in January. Arum said 
that Holmes once kicked Foreman out of a post-fight media conference and that 
Foreman will never forgive him for that. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman, who won the International Boxing Federation and WBA titles Saturday, 
is due to fight both organization's mandatory challenger, the past-his-prime 
Tony Tucker, sometime in 1995. But Arum says Foreman might be able to move the 
sport past the strangling alphabet politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "When something cataclysmic like this happens, everybody rethinks their 
positions," Arum said. "And people might be willing to take a risk and have 
fights the way we used to, contender vs. contender. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a sport that can't get sponsors, a sport most people look at with a 
jaundiced eye. This is a sport hardly on the pinnacle of popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now you have an event like what happened last night. And for a reasonable 
amount of time, it will change the perception. Maybe it'll just be for a moment 
of time, but we have some breathing space. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if we go back with that same old Tony Tucker . . . , it'll go right back 
into the dump." 
</P>
<P>
 Left in the background were questions about Moorer's future. Moorer had said 
even before winning the title last April that he eagerly awaited his chance to 
retire and go into law enforcement, and was far from a popular champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Michael will have to come back," Duva said. "I don't think he can 
quit that way. What, is he going to become a cop?" 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer, of course, could always take 10 years off, experience a religious 
rebirth and come back into the ring to win back the title. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who just accomplished that feat flew back to his Houston home Sunday 
morning, and, though he held no more news conferences, the thunder was still 
sounding.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL; MEDIA, COACHES AGREE: CORNHUSKERS ARE NO. 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 College football's two major polls now agree: Nebraska is No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cornhuskers, already No. 1 in the Associated Press media poll, replaced 
Penn State as the top team in the USA Today-CNN coaches' poll Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 After Nebraska routed Kansas, 45-17, and Penn State looked sluggish in a 35-29 
victory over Indiana on Saturday, the Cornhuskers gained ground in both polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve coaches shifted their first-place votes from Penn State to Nebraska, 
giving the Cornhuskers a 42-20 advantage. Six media members pulled the same 
switch, increasing Nebraska's first-place margin to 39-22. 
</P>
<P>
 In total points, Nebraska leads Penn State by 18 in the AP poll and 27 in the 
USA Today-CNN poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne said he was surprised by the big swing in the 
coaches' poll. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be close and we might possibly be rated ahead in both 
polls, but I wasn't sure that we would," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, a split national championship seemed like a distinct possibility. 
Now Nebraska (10-0) is in the driver's seat in both polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we control our own destiny," linebacker Ed Stewart said. "If we play like 
we are capable of the rest of the season, we should be in good shape." 
</P>
<P>
 If Nebraska beats Iowa State and Oklahoma, then defeats No. 5 Miami or No. 8 
Florida State in the Orange Bowl, it would probably be the consensus champion. 
If the Cornhuskers don't lose, tie or play poorly in a close victory, Penn 
State could go undefeated and not win any share of the title for the fourth 
time under Joe Paterno. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State spokesman Jeff Nelson said Paterno would not comment on the polls 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nittany Lions (8-0) have games remaining against Illinois, Northwestern 
and Michigan State before a probable Rose Bowl appearance against the Pacific 
10 Conference champion. No. 13 Arizona, No. 15 Oregon and No. 17 USC are tied 
for the Pac-10 lead.

RAIDERS WANT ESPN RETRACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders are demanding a retraction from ESPN for its report that Coach Art 
Shell used a racist remark in a sideline argument with quarterback Jeff 
Hostetler at Miami on Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Raider organization and Coach Art Shell are greatly disturbed," said Amy 
Trask, who handles legal affairs for the club, "and we have demanded a 
retraction as we are entitled to under the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Copies of the letter were sent to ESPN, Capital Cities, the parent company, 
and ABC, another Capital Cities property. An ESPN spokesman confirmed receiving 
the letter but refused further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after the ESPN report, The Times reported that three independent 
sources verified that Shell derisively compared Hostetler to former Raider 
quarterback Jay Schroeder. STEVE SPRINGER

COMMENTARY; CHANDLER RINGS UP THIS VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has come down to this for the Rams and their quarterback rotation: 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever's the least concussed gets to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Chandler started Sunday's game against the Denver Broncos not because 
his arm was any stronger than Chris Miller's, or his feet quicker, but because 
his head was clearer. Miller had spent most of the bye week walking around Rams 
Park in a fog, which began rolling in some time after linebacker Ernest Dixon 
of the New Orleans Saints spiked Miller's brain pan on the floor of the 
Superdome. 
</P>
<P>
 "A mush head," Miller called himself as he tried to blink away the haze, and 
that was all Coach Chuck Knox had to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 Melonheads in the stands, mush heads in the offensive huddle. This was no kind 
of home-field advantage, not to Knox's way of thinking, so Chandler moved up 
the depth chart, primarily on his ability to read a depth chart, and a 
newspaper, and a defense. 
</P>
<P>
 But wasn't that Mush Head Miller on the field with 5:17 left, chinstrap 
buttoned tight, flinging swing passes to Jerome Bettis in a desperate attempt 
to keep John Elway standing on the sideline, far, far away from that six-point 
Ram lead? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it was, and for that, the Rams can thank Steve Atwater. 
</P>
<P>
 Atwater, the Broncos' Excedrin Headache No. 27, came barreling in from his 
strong safety position to "get the wood" on Chandler, as Chandler put it once 
he was again able to construct complete sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler was attempting to sneak through the Denver line for the required 
inches on third and short at the Bronco 32, early in the third quarter. 
Chandler got the first down and then some. The ringing in his ears didn't 
subside for the rest of the game, eventually forcing Chandler to the bench 
after he'd called the wrong play on second and goal from the Denver one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Atwater, he hits as hard as anybody," Chandler said. "I got the first down, I 
was on my way down and he clears out and catches me right above the jawbone. 
Just rattled my jaw. It felt like all my teeth had shattered." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler staggered to his feet, took another snap and completed a 30-yard 
touchdown pass to Flipper Anderson. Chandler wasn't feeling altogether right, 
but, for the moment, he was feeling pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after smelling salts were administered and Tylenol swallowed, Chandler 
began to act a bit strange, behave a tad eccentric. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Rams' next possession, Chandler fumbled a snap on second down, 
prompting the Rams' first punt of the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The possession after that, Chandler called a reverse, handed the ball to 
Bettis -- who handed it to Jessie Hester -- and suddenly, without warning, 
threw a block at Bronco defensive end Jeff Robinson to spring Hester for a 
24-yard run, the Rams' longest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 This was downright bizarre, the Ram coaches agreed, and from that point on, 
they decided Chandler should be closely monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the Rams moved the ball down to the Bronco one. 
</P>
<P>
 First and goal, three feet from a 31-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 First down: Bettis up the middle, no gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Second down: Bettis up the middle, no gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Third down: Bettis up the middle, no gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Around Knox, 45,000 Ram fans booed. 
</P>
<P>
 In front of Knox, tight end Troy Drayton angrily pulled off his helmet and 
began screaming. 
</P>
<P>
 All of Anaheim Stadium seemed on the brink of mutiny, so Knox sent in Tony 
Zendejas to kick the field goal, and got his postgame explanation prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "That second-down call was a pass play," Knox wanted to assure the Ram 
faithful. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sent in a pass play but there was trouble with the communication. The 
quarterback went with the lead play. . . . He'd been dinged, and I think that 
affected him on that play." 
</P>
<P>
 A likely story, although by the time reporters could catch up to Chandler, his 
version jibed with Knox's. 
</P>
<P>
 "The headphone in my helmet wasn't working," Chandler said, "so I had to look 
to the sideline for the signal. Someone on the sideline was rolling his hand 
like this (Chandler twirled his right hand in a clockwise motion) and I thought 
that meant run the same play. What they really wanted was a pass." 
</P>
<P>
 Force of habit? 
</P>
<P>
 Or post-concussion syndrome? 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, Chandler was out of there. Doctor's advice and coach's orders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doc told me that it wasn't that bad now," Chandler said, "but if I got hit 
again, it wouldn't take much for it to become a serious deal." Having played 
cards with Miller last week, and having watched Miller stare vacantly at hand 
after hand, Chandler decided to trust Doc on this one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen what happened with Chris and I know about the deal with Merril 
Hoge," Chandler said, referring to the Chicago Bear running back who was driven 
to retirement after suffering repeated concussions. 
</P>
<P>
 "That kind of stuff does scare you a little bit. You don't want to jeopardize 
things. But another part of you says you can't say, 'My head's sore, I can't 
play.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a violent game, and you at least like to think you're a tough guy, that 
you can put up with things like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler consoled himself with the stat sheet: 19 for 25, 223 yards, two 
touchdowns, 27-21 Ram victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've still got a little bit of a headache," Chandler said, a half-hour after 
the final gun. "I feel a little bit slow. Noise bothers me, and it was really 
annoying at the end of the game, as loud as the crowd got out there. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's good," Chandler decided, "because that means we're winning." 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't need a ton of bricks -- or Steve Atwater -- to fall on him in order 
to recognize that.

GATT MAY NOT BE A HOT ISSUE JUST NOW, BUT IT WILL BE SOON; TRADE: ELECTIONS ARE 
FOCUSED ON OTHER ISSUES, BUT CLINTON WANTS A VOTE ON PACT THIS MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In this season of political discontent, amid the swelling chorus of complaints 
voiced by angry and anxious voters heading to the polls on Tuesday, one 
particularly frustrated, even fearful, voice can be heard. 
</P>
<P>
 It belongs to Michael Macaluso, president of RiverView Sportswear Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 This year Macaluso will sell close to $8 million in women's blouses, jackets 
and skirts to some of the mainstays of the U.S. fashion industry. Some 300 
workers, aided by computers, cut, sew and package 2 million garments a year in 
his growing complex of buildings covering 90,000 square feet in this southern 
New Jersey suburb of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 His major customers used to buy all their merchandise from Macaluso and other 
U.S. manufacturers, but they now acquire some of their stock from foreign 
producers. Over the past three years, Macaluso says, competition from imports 
has forced him to lay off 30% of his work force. 
</P>
<P>
 But the landscape is about to shift. And for some, as for Macaluso, that kind 
of job erosion could get a lot worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Though most voters have other things on their minds at the moment, in just 
three weeks the ground rules of international trade will change if Congress 
does President Clinton's bidding and endorses the newly revised General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade later this month. If approved, the new GATT 
accord would clear the way for expanded trade by cutting import tariffs and 
removing other barriers to global commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Few current issues have the potential for a wider or longer-lasting impact on 
the U.S. economy, voices on both sides of the debate agree. The new pact would 
slash trade-related taxes around the world, open markets for products made in 
American factories, and intertwine the future of the U.S. economy with that of 
an international organization that would be given far-reaching authority to 
regulate world trade. 
</P>
<P>
 According to its backers, the expanded GATT would create new business 
opportunities and generate new jobs for Americans as foreign companies 
increasingly open their markets to U.S. goods. The beneficial effects could 
begin to be felt as soon as next year, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Just don't expect Macaluso -- or others who form key voter constituencies 
around the country -- to join in any celebration should GATT pass. GATT would 
gradually open currently restricted U.S. markets to products made by lower-cost 
overseas competitors. Some Asian clothing makers, for instance, pay their 
workers one-tenth or less of the wages that Macaluso says his employees 
receive. 
</P>
<P>
 The new world trade pact, Macaluso says, would "put companies like mine out of 
business and people on unemployment." 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of Tuesday's mid-term congressional elections -- after a campaign 
season focused primarily on voters' concerns about rising crime rates and 
dissatisfaction with the ways of Washington -- the new world trade agreement 
has been something of a stealth issue: nearly invisible, but potentially 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 GATT's low profile sits just fine with the Clinton Administration, which is 
pushing behind the scenes to win approval of the plan during a special 
lame-duck session of Congress scheduled for the week of Nov. 27. White House 
officials, in fact, are grateful that so far GATT does not seem to have 
contributed much to the angry mood of the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are mindful that GATT has formidable opponents and that the politics 
of trade can be explosive. 
</P>
<P>
 At its heart, argues Ross K. Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers 
University in New Brunswick, N.J., any public unease about the trade plan 
reflects a much broader discomfort Americans feel over a loss of control over 
their communities and over society in general. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime and social values are the core of the debate, this sense that peoples' 
lives are out of control, that these forces are exercising power at their 
expense," Baker says. "GATT is one more thing that these large and impersonal 
forces are imposing on people. It's a mood issue. It's elusive, but it is out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the trade measure has caught the attention of some union 
activists and garment manufacturers. It is a subtle undercurrent in individual 
campaigns in the Northeast and Midwest, where particular industries feel 
threatened by the potential removal of protective tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration suffered a setback last month when it was unable to 
overcome opposition and push the trade plan through Congress before this week's 
election. The White House is content for now to keep a lid on the controversy 
and avoid a blowup similar to the one that almost derailed the North American 
Free Trade Agreement early this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress is considering legislation that would implement U.S. participation in 
the redrawn version of the agreement that has governed world trade for the past 
47 years. If the new accord takes effect as planned, the existing GATT 
bureaucracy will be replaced by a new entity, the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 When it agreed to put off the vote until after the election, the White House 
won assurances from Republican leaders that there would be bipartisan support. 
</P>
<P>
 But the delay gave opponents a window of opportunity. After Election Day, they 
plan to pressure the newly elected Congress to put off the GATT vote until 
1995. Postponing the vote until next year could endanger GATT for procedural 
and political reasons. Some of the lawmakers who would vote on the issue this 
month will not be returning to Capitol Hill in January, and might feel less 
political pressure to reject the trade pact. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pennsylvania, allies of Ross Perot have pressed Sen. Harris Wofford, a 
Democrat who is in a tight reelection battle, to pledge that he would not vote 
for the plan until it is resubmitted to a new session of Congress in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as a campaign issue, GATT has the labor unions and other opponents in a 
bind: Many of the lawmakers they want to turn against the trade plan are 
natural allies on other issues. As a result, they are reluctant to threaten 
GATT supporters in the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the looming fight over the trade plan has galvanized unions such as 
the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and the International Union of 
Electrical Workers. "Our members are registered voters, and they are political 
activists on things that are important to them, which are jobs and imports in 
the garment industry," says Laurel Brennan, a business agent of the garment 
workers' union in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eyes of GATT supporters, such examples are exceptions; the rule, they 
say, is expanded trade. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration estimates that the new GATT agreement would increase 
economic activity in this country by $100 billion to $200 billion annually. 
Others have arrived at lesser figures; the Institute for International 
Economics, for example, predicts that U.S. output would increase by about 1%, 
or roughly $65 billion annually by 2004.

ELECTIONS / PREVIEW; SUPERVISOR HOPEFULS STILL POUNDING THE PAVEMENT; POLITICS: 
FINAL WEEKEND FINDS QUARTET CONTINUING BIDS FOR GRASS-ROOTS SUPPORT. RESULTS 
COULD SHAPE PUBLIC POLICY FOR YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ventura County supervisorial candidates spent the final weekend of the 
campaign doing what they've been doing for weeks: knocking on doors, handing 
out flyers and dialing up voters with pleas for support. 
</P>
<P>
 The four candidates for two open seats on the Board of Supervisors kept a 
grueling, grin-and-bear-it schedule that saw them racing back and forth across 
their districts, trying to contact as many voters as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Trudi Loh, a candidate in the 2nd Supervisorial District, kicked things off 
early Saturday with a marathon door-to-door campaign that began in Port 
Hueneme, moved on to Oxnard and ended at the far east end of the county in Oak 
Park. The district also includes most of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking real good going into Tuesday," Loh told half a dozen Oxnard 
firefighters who volunteered their day off to help her campaign. "It's a real 
tight race." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was clear after the first few doors Loh knocked on that there was a lot 
of work left to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me read this over," a Port Hueneme resident said after Loh handed him a 
flyer. "I'm still not familiar with all the stuff on the ballot." 
</P>
<P>
 Loh's opponent, Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo, started Saturday by 
hand-delivering campaign flyers in Oak Park before moving on to Thousand Oaks. 
Dressed in blue jeans, red sweater and a blue-and-white "Vote for Schillo" cap, 
the candidate said it was his 62nd day of knocking on doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only way to do it," Schillo said. "This is what you build a 
campaign on, walking. People want to see the guy they're voting for." 
</P>
<P>
 After spending a minute or two talking with residents on their doorsteps, 
Schillo made sure to mark either a yes, no or undecided on his note pad. For 
the most part, it was a good day, with dozens of residents promising to vote 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were some houses with Loh campaign signs planted in the lawn that 
Schillo bypassed altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should I talk to them? They've already made up their mind," he said, 
before racing onto the next residence. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates in the 4th Supervisorial District, which covers Simi Valley and 
Moorpark, were also busy pounding the pavement over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, candidate Judy Mikels hit the streets in Simi Valley, armed with 
campaign flyers and complimentary note pads. Mikels, a local city councilwoman, 
said she has been walking precincts for several weeks and is still surprised by 
some of the responses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I'll vote for you," one man said after glancing over Mikels' flyer. 
"Where do you vote?" 
</P>
<P>
 While this type of campaigning can be discouraging at times, Mikels said she 
believes that going door-to-door is still the best way to reach voters and 
planned to do it again today. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Montgomery, a Moorpark councilman who said he has done "two pairs of 
shoes worth" of campaign walking, also spent the day distributing flyers in 
Simi Valley. He said he was pleased with responses from voters, but he also 
sensed that many are tired of all the campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can just tell people are ready to have the election over with," he said. 
"This is hard to do on Sundays. I know I'm disturbing people when I ring their 
doorbells." 
</P>
<P>
 Although only about 60% of the county's registered voters are expected to make 
it to the polls Tuesday, local officials say the results of the election could 
shape public policy for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 The two new supervisors, officials say, may determine whether a commercial 
airport is developed at Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station and settle a 
longstanding dispute over a proposed landfill at Weldon Canyon, between Ventura 
and Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, they will have to grapple with a projected $40-million to 
$50-million county budget deficit, new air quality regulations, rising health 
care costs for county employees and a proposal to train county firefighters as 
paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, who chose to step down from her 2nd District post 
after one term, said whoever wins the two supervisorial seats will quickly 
learn how difficult the job is, particularly with a shrinking county budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of promises have been made that can't be kept," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk, a political newcomer who won a surprise victory over 
then-Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer in 1990, said she learned a lot about 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 After running on a pro-environment platform opposing the giant Ahmanson Ranch 
housing project in the east county, VanderKolk helped engineer a deal to allow 
the development in exchange for thousands of acres of public parkland. The 
result, however, was that she lost the support of many of those who helped 
elect her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned," VanderKolk said of her job. "It's much harder than I thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Voters won't have trouble distinguishing between the two candidates competing 
for VanderKolk's job. Schillo and Loh hold divergent views on most major 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo supports the proposed landfill at Weldon Canyon, Loh opposes it, 
preferring to explore other options for trash disposal, including possibly 
shipping it elsewhere by rail. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo strongly favors a plan to establish a commercial airport at Point Mugu 
to attract new businesses, while Loh has expressed concern that a facility 
could spark development on farms around the military base. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Loh, who is supported by county firefighters, favors a 
proposal to train them as paramedics to improve emergency response. She said 
she believes that such a program could be phased in gradually and eventually 
pay for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo, who has received contributions from one of the largest ambulance 
companies in the county, said he believes that private ambulance companies are 
doing a good job and that it would be too costly for the county to provide such 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 The paramedic issue has also split the candidates in the 4th Supervisorial 
District for similar reasons. Montgomery supports a county program; Mikels is 
not convinced that it is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Both, however, favor development of a new landfill at Weldon Canyon. They say 
they are concerned that if a new dump is not built, the Simi Valley Landfill 
will bear the burden for the entire county. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the increasing demand for services and dwindling revenues, all of 
the candidates agree that cutting the county's operating costs will be among 
their top priorities. Each has proposed plans for the county to work more 
closely with cities to share services, equipment and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo, for example, has proposed that the county Fire Department perform 
some building and safety services now done by the city of Thousand Oaks. Loh 
has suggested consolidating county library services, perhaps even closing some 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to find a better and more efficient way to get materials out to 
people," Loh said, adding that the county may want to consider charging for the 
use of some library materials or computer-access services. "There aren't going 
to be any easy choices." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the two supervisorial races, county voters will also decide the 
race for auditor-controller. Incumbent Thomas O. Mahon, who was appointed 
auditor last year by the Board of Supervisors, is running against accountant 
Richard Morrisset of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon, who served as assistant auditor for more than 20 years before assuming 
the top job, says his experience gives him an edge in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 But Morrisset says Mahon has been in the job so long that he has become part 
of the county bureaucracy. Moreover, he says Mahon cannot be impartial because 
he has accepted campaign contributions from county employees and officials, all 
of whom are subject to county audits. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon says the contributions only represent the confidence people have in his 
ability to do his job well. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a closer look at the state and federal races that Ventura County 
voters will face Tuesday: State Senate District 18 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) is competing against former San 
Luis Obispo County Supervisor Steve MacElvaine for an open seat in the 18th 
California Senate District that includes Ventura, Santa Paula and Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 MacElvaine has sought to paint O'Connell as a tax-and-spend Democrat, who as 
speaker pro tem of the Assembly must carry a large part of the blame for the 
state's economic problems. O'Connell, who was recently successful in passing 
legislation to ban offshore drilling, has hammered MacElvaine for his support 
of oil drilling along the district's coastline while a member of the California 
Coastal Commission. Assembly District 38 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Paula L. Boland (R-Granada Hills) is being challenged by 
19-year-old Chatsworth resident Josh Arce in a district that includes Simi 
Valley and Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Arce, a political science major at UCLA, has attacked Boland for her 
antiabortion stance and for excessive partisanship, contributing to the 
gridlock in Sacramento. Boland's campaign has mostly ignored Arce, focusing 
mainly on the laws she helped pass to increase penalties for rapists and child 
molesters. Assembly District 37 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Nao Takasugi (R-Oxnard) faces former Oxnard City Councilwoman 
Dorothy Maron in a district that covers most of Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Port 
Hueneme and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Maron has attacked Takasugi for doing little to curb crime and joblessness. 
However, Takasugi said he helped reform workers' compensation laws and was 
instrumental in getting last year's budget out on schedule for the first time 
in seven years. Congressional District 23 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) is being challenged by Democrat Kevin 
Ready, a Santa Barbara County deputy counsel, in the district that covers a 
tiny piece of Santa Barbara County and all of Ventura County except most of 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ready is a mainstream Democrat whose political philosophy sharply contrasts 
with Gallegly's conservative views. Ready favors abortion rights, universal 
health care and opposes Proposition 187, the state initiative that would ban 
most government services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly opposes abortion in most cases, wants to keep the government out of 
health care and, as a leading voice against illegal immigration, supports 
Proposition 187. Congressional District 24 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), an 18-year incumbent, faces what 
could be the toughest challenge of his political life in a race against 
Republican Richard Sybert, Gov. Pete Wilson's former director of planning and 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, who has put more than $400,000 of his own money into the 
million-dollar race, has attacked Beilenson for supporting the Clinton 
Administration's crime bill, budget deficit-reduction plan and health care 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, on the other hand, has sought to paint Sybert as a carpetbagger 
because he moved into the district only last year for the express purpose of 
running for Congress. Beilenson, who has received no campaign contributions 
from political action committees, has also described Sybert in campaign 
literature as "PAC-Man" for accepting at least $60,000 from such sources.

LIFE SUPPORT; COUNCIL ON AGING MAY BE DONE IN BY DEBT, LEAVING UNMET NEEDS

 Grace Balzer doesn't like to drive anymore. Gripping a steering wheel hurts 
her arthritic hands. And driving in traffic makes her nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the 71-year-old Oxnard resident has to go to the doctor or just pick 
up some groceries, she picks up the phone and calls Dial-a-Ride. 
</P>
<P>
 A dispatcher manning the 24-hour phone line arranges for a volunteer to pick 
her up and take her back home at no charge -- a service that Balzer and about 
1,000 Oxnard and Port Hueneme senior citizens on fixed incomes have come to 
rely on. 
</P>
<P>
 Dial-a-Ride is operated by the Ventura County Council on Aging, which also 
offers free health care, groceries and activities to low-income senior citizens 
from its center on Rose Avenue in south Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 But the nonprofit group is faced with possible closure as a result of recent 
financial woes. And Balzer and other seniors say the loss would leave a big 
hole in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't afford a taxicab," said Balzer, whose husband died in 1977. "I'm 
on Social Security, and that's not much." 
</P>
<P>
 The organization declared bankruptcy last month, after being named in a 
breach-of-contract lawsuit that seeks $300,000 in damages, council President 
June Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Nov. 17 hearing in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Santa Barbara, the group 
will ask to be forgiven the $300,000 it owes to creditors. If the debts are not 
wiped out, Schmidt said, the center will have to close its doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly would break our hearts," Schmidt said. "We just don't want to 
let it go." 
</P>
<P>
 The council has served Oxnard-area senior citizens since 1974. But bad 
business decisions in recent years have put the entire organization in 
jeopardy, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt said the group's troubles began in 1992 when a former office manager 
decided to move the council's Rose Avenue headquarters to Pleasant Valley Road. 
</P>
<P>
 With the board's approval, Polly Howell ordered nearly $500,000 in renovations 
to the new center and signed a 10-year lease to rent the building for $1,800 a 
month, Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 It quickly became apparent that the council could not afford the new site, so 
the group broke its contract with the landlord and moved back to its old office 
on Rose, Schmidt said. Rent there is $700 a month, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rent at the Pleasant Valley Road site was so astronomical, there was no 
way we could make enough money to survive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elise Rogers, who founded the organization and was a vice president on the 
board when the move was made, had no comment on past decisions. Howell, the 
former office manager, was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's programs are funded by profits from twice-weekly bingo games 
held at the center, Schmidt said. The group also receives private donations, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Dial-a-Ride, the council offers frequent health clinics where senior 
citizens have their blood pressure checked and receive free flu shots. It also 
provides free groceries to about 500 seniors and maintains a fund to aid 
seniors behind in their rent, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the week, knots of elderly residents can be found involved in 
embroidery, bead design and other classes at the center. Some have been meeting 
at the center weekly for more than a decade to play pinochle or canasta, 
Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evelyn Lopez, 77, has been coming to the center two or three times a week 
since 1979. She likes to make crafts, she said, carefully gluing a lock of 
curly brown hair on a small doll she was making. 
</P>
<P>
 And she likes to visit with about 10 other women who share her avocation. The 
women plan to write a letter to the court outlining the center's importance in 
their lives, Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what we would do if the center closed," she said. "We would have 
no other place to meet." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard has a city-run facility, the Wilson Senior Center, which is much 
smaller than the Council on Aging's facility, Lopez said. Balzer, whose eight 
children are spread out all over the United States, said she depends on the 
center for her social life. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I didn't have the center, I'd be talking to the walls," she said.

GROUP SEEKS NAVY SITE TO OFFER SERVICES TO HOMELESS; PORT HUENEME: ADVOCATES 
WANT TO CREATE ONE-STOP CENTER OFFERING HOST OF PROGRAMS ON STRIP OF SURPLUS 
LAND. BUT PLAN FACES COMPETING PROPOSALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Homeless advocates say they will seek federal permission to convert a U. S. 
Navy laboratory at the mouth of Port Hueneme Harbor into a one-stop 
clearinghouse providing housing and a variety of social services to Ventura 
County's homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates say the need for such a center will increase its chances of becoming 
reality, even though it is proposed for an oceanfront strip of surplus Navy 
land targeted for port expansion and other economic development efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 For three months, a coalition of nonprofit groups has been drafting a proposal 
to lease 13 of the 78 buildings on the 33-acre parcel from the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The lease price is not yet determined, but would be paid with state and 
federal help. 
</P>
<P>
 As envisioned, the center would offer job training, drug and alcohol 
counseling, medical care, help for victims of domestic violence and a host of 
other services. 
</P>
<P>
 No place in Ventura County offers such a range of programs under one roof. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all these services to be at one site makes a lot of sense to the person 
who is homeless," said Karen Ingram, vice president of Lutheran Social Services 
of Southern California, which is spearheading the conversion effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal, by having a continuum of services at one site, is to make it easier 
for homeless people to get the services they need and to get the help they 
need." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal was conceived after the Naval Civil Engineering Laboratory in 
Port Hueneme was targeted last year for closure during the third round of 
nationwide base closures and realignments. 
</P>
<P>
 That facility is in the process of shutting down and moving onto the sprawling 
Naval Construction Battalion Center to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, groups interested in acquiring the Navy land have been 
lining up with proposals for the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State University, the Oxnard Union High School District and several other 
agencies have expressed interest in the land. Most recently, the city of Port 
Hueneme and the Oxnard Harbor District agreed to try to jointly acquire the 
parcel in an effort to expand the regional port and boost economic 
opportunities there. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time, it appeared that the homeless coalition had them all beaten. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987 gave homeless 
organizations priority on all surplus federal property. The federal law 
requires surplus land to be offered first to other federal agencies before 
being offered to local homeless groups. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, no federal agency stepped up to claim the Navy property so the 
coalition would have had first crack at it. 
</P>
<P>
 But under an amendment to that law signed last week by President Clinton, 
military bases will now be exempt from the Homeless Assistance Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the homeless coalition, which has no formal name, will have to compete 
with other interested groups for the property. And instead of the coalition 
dealing directly with federal officials to acquire the land, it will have to 
deal with a local committee overseeing the reuse of the surplus Navy land. 
</P>
<P>
 The U. S. Department of Defense still has the final say over who gets the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 "It changes the rules midstream," Ingram said. "But we've got what we feel is 
a very comprehensive package. I am still very hopeful that the needs of the 
homeless in this county can be met." 
</P>
<P>
 But a local committee overseeing reuse of the land has already expressed 
concerns about turning over that property to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Figg -- Port Hueneme's community development director and coordinator for 
the committee, made up of city officials, civic leaders and homeless advocates 
-- said the panel is looking at developing economic opportunities on the 
33-acre parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Economics figure very prominently into our reuse plan," Figg said. "We are 
very much land-poor . . . and we can little afford to squander the few 
remaining economic development opportunities that we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Figg noted that even with the amendment to the McKinney Act, the needs of the 
homeless must still be addressed in community reuse plans. And he said the 
committee stands ready to fulfill that obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 Just two months ago, Figg said the committee fashioned a proposal to fund 
homeless programs by forming a redevelopment area on the surplus land. 
</P>
<P>
 Under redevelopment law, 20% of the tax increment generated by a redevelopment 
project must be set aside to benefit low- and moderate-income residents. The 
tax increment is the increased tax paid on redevelopment land as its value 
increases. Figg said some or all of that set aside could pay for services for 
the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we came up with the redevelopment concept is to allow the city to 
proceed with the highest and best use of this property," Figg said. "We've been 
trying to work and address this issue in a very rational and very humanistic 
manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the offer, advocates for the homeless say acquisition of land for 
homeless programs is just as important as money to run them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The homeless need a place where, with their very marginal incomes, they can 
afford to live and where they can be safe," said Mary Ann Decaen, community 
services coordinator for Catholic Charities. "We just really have to sell that 
idea to those who may have another option for potential use of that property." 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition pitching the multi-service center plan is made up of Lutheran 
Social Services, Catholic Charities, Interface Children, Family Services of 
Ventura County and Khepera House, a Ventura-based drug and alcohol treatment 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the homeless service center are still sketchy, and coalition members 
are uncertain how many of Ventura County's estimated 2,000 to 3,000 homeless 
people the center would be able to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 The local committee overseeing reuse of the surplus land is scheduled to have 
its plan completed by early next year. The Defense Department is expected to 
decide who gets the land in early 1996.

RAIL BUFFS DEDICATED TO RESTORING OLD STATION; SIMI VALLEY: A LOVE OF TRAINS 
HAS INSPIRED A SMALL GROUP OF VOLUNTEERS TO SPEND NINE YEARS SALVAGING THE 
SANTA SUSANA DEPOT. NOW THEY AWAIT FEDERAL FUNDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The word travels quickly from man to man at the old Santa Susana railroad 
depot. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the shriek of the Amtrak train's greeting to them cuts through the 
twilight quiet of Santa Susana Knolls, they know that the train is coming. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen men show up at the depot every Wednesday night and Saturday 
morning. They are intent on turning the historic landmark, a symbol of Simi 
Valley's earliest days, into a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the heart of their restoration effort is a love of trains, and the 
railroad enthusiasts are likely to toss aside paintbrushes, hammers and nails 
whenever a train goes by. 
</P>
<P>
 Automatically, they rush to take positions facing the tracks, leaning from the 
depot's open cargo-loading door or standing alongside the faded 
yellow-and-brown building. 
</P>
<P>
 They have seen plenty of trains go by in their day, but each one is still 
magical. The silver train comes into sudden sight from the west, speeding 
around a curve right toward the small greeting party. 
</P>
<P>
 From an open window, the engineer waves. The men stand in a silent salute, 
watching the train whisk out of sight into the Santa Susana Mountains, onward 
to Los Angeles. Then they turn to each other and resume conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 The spell is broken, but only temporarily. Metrolink is due to roll by in a 
few more minutes and, when it does, the whole sequence of train worship will 
commence again. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Rehart, one of the volunteer workers, searched for a way to explain the 
odd little ceremony, a mixture of nostalgia for the depot's glory days -- when 
every orange and walnut that left Simi Valley passed through that depot -- and 
a romantic vision of the passing train. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's also because the train is going somewhere and, in a way, you 
kind of say, 'Geez, I'd like to be going there too,' " Rehart said. "You're 
kind of envisioning what is at the end of the track." 
</P>
<P>
 Rehart and about 10 others have been gathering at this remote corner of Simi 
Valley to work on the 91-year-old historical building for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 With faithful but few hands to help and fewer funds available, the process of 
restoring the old Southern Pacific railroad building has been painfully slow. 
It took them four years just to build bathrooms for the place. 
</P>
<P>
 Help is finally in sight for the volunteers. Earlier this year, the California 
Transportation Commission awarded a $250,000 grant to the depot owners, the 
Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant money for landscaping and exterior repairs has yet to make its way 
to Simi Valley. Park district spokesman Rick Johnson said he hoped that it 
would be available by December, in which case work could begin on the depot 
exterior in the early spring, once the state approves the plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the grant comes through, the project depends on the Rancho Simi 
Foundation, which has been raising money for the depot since 1985. But the 
proceeds from bake sales and baseball game fund-raisers have added up slowly, 
and the building needs a great deal of work to overcome damage by fire, vandals 
and years of disuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a labor of love," said Walt Griffin, an Agoura Hills schoolteacher who 
has been a leader in the restoration effort. "But it has been very frustrating. 
You know, if I'd had the money, I would have had it done in a year." 
</P>
<P>
 The district bought the depot in 1974 from Southern Pacific. According to Simi 
Valley resident Ken Garges, who is writing a history of the local railroads, 
Southern Pacific shut the place down in 1964, converting it to warehouse space. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, the depot was still in its original location, between Los 
Angeles Avenue and the railroad tracks, about 500 feet from Tapo Street. In 
1975, when Los Angeles Avenue was widened, the park district moved the depot to 
Santa Susana Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the district had only paid $1.06 for the redwood structure, it cost 
about $25,000 to move it to the park. After that, the financially strapped 
district could never find the money in its budget to pay for the restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Historical Society has not taken an active role in the 
restoration. Instead, the society has concentrated its efforts on preserving 
other landmarks, such as the Simi Adobe and Strathearn House. 
</P>
<P>
 So the depot sat at the park for a lonely decade, boarded up, its paint 
peeling, dust swirling around its bare foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, vandals broke all the windows and an arsonist set fire to the 
depot, destroying the upstairs apartment where the depot agents had lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Griffin and his friends in the Santa Susana Model Railroad Club 
discovered the depot. It seemed to them the perfect spot to set up a vast model 
of the area's old railroad system from the 1920s, showing stations from Oxnard 
to Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 But the park district was not selling the property, or renting it. Instead, 
they worked out an agreement in which the model railroaders would raise money 
for the Rancho Simi Foundation, do some restoration and still be able to use 
the space for their model trains. 
</P>
<P>
 The history buff in Griffin was quickly lured away from the model trains by 
the intrigue of the real depot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't intentional," he said. "But now I work on the depot way more than 
the train layout." 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers are an introverted bunch, Griffin said, prone to long, 
companionable silences. They are tied together by a sense of nostalgia and an 
interest in history. Working on the depot is their version of a night out at a 
bar, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond installing bathrooms for the public, the restoration plans call for 
returning the waiting rooms, ticket office and freight room to their original 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Pacific railroad depots were always quite simple, according to 
Garges, and practically identical. The original Moorpark depot, long since torn 
down, was built on the same standard plan as the Santa Susana depot. 
</P>
<P>
 Garges first saw the station in 1937, when he arrived in Simi Valley by 
passenger train. He described it as a bustling little station, filled with 
farmers shipping out their fruits and nuts and with residents picking up 
household items they had ordered by catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 The park district and the volunteers envision it becoming a bustling place 
again, visited by schoolchildren and residents curious about Simi Valley's 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, they work away quietly, making small discoveries -- a pile of 
coal in the wall they have put away for a future display, the original sign 
that used to hang on the side of the building found at a flea market -- and 
waiting for that money.

STREET SMART: END TO WORK ON KIMBALL OVERPASS SPEEDS INTO SIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 As many are aware, the traffic on Telephone and Telegraph roads in Ventura is 
extremely heavy. 
</P>
<P>
 When traveling south on the new Kimball Road overpass, it appears that 
construction work at the on-ramp for the westbound Santa Paula Freeway is 
complete. Yet the ramp remains closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not remove the barricades and open it for use? This would relieve some of 
the pressure on Telephone and Telegraph. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Lane, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Good news: Most construction work in the Kimball Road area is scheduled to be 
completed by Nov. 15, Traffic Engineer Nazir Lalani says. 
</P>
<P>
 The city decided to keep the ramps closed during construction so that the road 
and ramp widening could be done more quickly, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to get the whole thing done before the rainy season," Lalani said. 
"When you have traffic buzzing by, the risk level goes up and the work goes 
more slowly." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I live along Telegraph Road in Ventura and am a frequent user of the left-turn 
signal light for southbound Victoria Avenue traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a popular intersection, where at peak hours there are at least half a 
dozen vehicles lined up to turn left. But the light only stays green long 
enough to allow three cars to turn. 
</P>
<P>
 I have seen numerous near collisions with oncoming traffic and have been 
nearly rear-ended by anxious drivers who wanted to get through the intersection 
without waiting out another cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 The obvious solution would be to extend the green time to allow more vehicles 
to make a safe turn. 
</P>
<P>
 It would sure reduce the wait and ultimately increase safety at that 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Hajost, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the infuriatingly short green arrow at Victoria and Telegraph, 
there's good news and bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is that no time can be added to the arrow because it would throw 
off the entire synchronization of the signal, Traffic Engineer Nazir Lalani 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the city is aware that turning here is a problem. "I freely admit 
it's a royal pain," Lalani said. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is a second left-turn lane is scheduled to be added in February. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we get the second turn lane in, I think you'll see traffic flowing much 
more smoothly through that intersection," he said. 
</P>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I live in Moorpark on Peppermill Street and am having a problem with people 
driving too fast. 
</P>
<P>
 The speed limit is 25 m.p.h., but many people zoom by at speeds in excess of 
45 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a residential neighborhood with many children playing outside. 
</P>
<P>
 I am concerned that the problem will not be dealt with until one of them gets 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
 What options are available to slow people down? 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Medley, Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Speeding on residential streets is a problem in just about every neighborhood 
in town, Moorpark Public Works Director Ken Gilbert says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've found that in many cases the speeders live in the neighborhood," 
Gilbert said. "They're driving on automatic pilot and don't realize how fast 
they're going." 
</P>
<P>
 To combat the problem, the city recently purchased a portable electronic 
display board that reads the speeds of passing vehicles and projects them on a 
large screen. The city plans to rotate the board at various sites around town. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert hopes that seeing the excessive speeds written in large figures will 
jolt or embarrass drivers into slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you live in the neighborhood and your neighbors see your speed on this big 
board, you might think twice about speeding," Gilbert said.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VETERANS' WALL REPLICA GOES BACK ON DISPLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A single red rose in her hand, Joanne Wilson of Oxnard looked over the 
thousands of names before her, searching for the one that counted most. 
</P>
<P>
 She found it on Panel 20: David Wilson II. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was only over there for 4 1/2 months," Joanne Wilson said of her son, one 
of more than 58,000 soldiers who died in the Vietnam War. "We saw the original 
(memorial), but this one is pretty impressive." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of people crowded the south lawn of the Ventura County Government 
Center on Sunday to welcome the return of the half-size Vietnam Veterans 
Memorial and recognize those who have fought for their country. The wall was 
last in Ventura County three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Vietnam Veterans of Ventura County, the replica wall will be 
on display through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's therapy for me," said Stan Holladay of Ventura, who hooked up phone 
lines and other communications for the U. S. Army when he was in Vietnam. "It's 
remembering the loss of a lot of good friends and overcoming a lot of 
hardships." 
</P>
<P>
 Like others at Sunday's ceremony, Holladay knows exactly how long he spent in 
Vietnam: "Ten months, 29 days," he said, listening to an address by James 
Delker, commanding officer of the Naval Construction Battalion Center at Port 
Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a few friends up there," Holladay said, motioning to the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Camacho, president of the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of Ventura 
County, said the replica would help heal some of the wounds that are still 
festering among many veterans, decades after the war. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who can't make the journey to Washington can see it here," Camacho 
said. "And it helps the local vets make peace with themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Joe Saenz of Ventura was scanning the wall for names he might 
recognize. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were men who died for what they believed in," said Saenz, a former Air 
Force helicopter gunman, who was shot down twice during the 18 months he spent 
in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were supposed to have a barbecue when he came back," Saenz said of his 
friend, Clarence Young. "But he never came back." JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; CITY HALL TO HOLD ELECTION OPEN HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Paula residents are invited to an open house at City Hall on Tuesday to 
get the latest results on council elections and other local and state ballot 
issues, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will have a staff member at the County Government Center in Ventura 
who will call in election results to City Hall, said Kimberly Rodrigues, an 
administrative assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 After local polls close at 8 p.m., ballots will be delivered to City Hall, 
then transported to the Government Center. Initial results, mostly from 
absentee ballots, are expected about 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodrigues said two televisions will be set up and refreshments will be served 
in the council chambers on election night. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that City Hall, located at 970 Ventura St., will be open until 
results from Santa Paula elections are tabulated. CARLOS V. LOZANO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; COUNCIL TO DISCUSS CONDEMNATION ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of closed-door deliberations, the Ventura City Council tonight 
will discuss publicly whether to begin condemnation proceedings on the Ventura 
Marina Mobile Home Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Park tenants, distressed by increasingly high rents, have lobbied the city for 
years to condemn the property and force the family that holds the lease on the 
park to sell it to the owners of the mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Up until September, Wayne and Norma Peterson, the lease owners, were willing 
to participate in the condemnation. But in a Sept. 19 letter to the council, 
the Petersons said they had waited three years for a decision and could wait no 
longer. They will oppose any such proceedings in the future, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members agreed to hear from both sides at tonight's public hearing, 
but Richard Francis, an attorney who represents the tenants, said he does not 
hold out much hope for success. "I expect to go down in flames," he said. "I 
think it's probably too little too late at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Councilman Gregory L. Carson said he cannot get too enthusiastic over 
the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should the city condemn private property for a few residents' benefit?" 
he said. "Does that mean we would get requests to condemn other mobile homes in 
town? Where does it stop?" CONSTANCE SOMMER

 As part of the effort to cut down on materials being dumped in landfills, the 
county began distributing recycling containers to residents this week. Although 
no curbside pickup is available for Santa Susana Knolls residents, the 
containers are meant to make it easier to sort bottles, newspapers, aluminum 
and tin cans for drop-off at recycling centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Purchasing and distribution of the bins is paid by a state Department of 
Conservation grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Any resident who did not receive a set of bins should contact G. I. Rubbish at 
524-9400. For information about the workshop, call 654-9226. MARY F. POLS

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: TO PROS, THE STOCK SELLOFF QUESTION IS WHEN, NOT IF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a logic-defying levitation act, don't pay to see David Copperfield. Just 
take a look at the U.S. stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite bond yields at their highest levels in more than three years, most 
major stock indexes are hovering near their 1993 closes -- which means they've 
given up almost no ground in the midst of the worst bear market for bonds since 
the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 Even on Friday, when a strong October employment report sent the yield on the 
bellwether 30-year Treasury bond surging to a 39-month high of 8.15%, the stock 
market held up remarkably well until hit by some computerized "program" trading 
late in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average lost 38.36 points to 3,807.52 on Friday, but 
it remains 1.4% above its year-end '93 close of 3,754.09. 
</P>
<P>
 And contrary to a popular Wall Street view, the blue-chip Dow isn't propping 
up the market by itself. The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, at 462.28 
now, is a mere 0.9% below its year-end close and just 4% below its peak set in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 More significant to individual investors, the average U.S. stock mutual fund 
is down less than 1% in value this year, according to fund-tracker Lipper 
Analytical. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Wall Street veterans, if told 10 months ago where short- and long-term 
interest rates would be today, would almost certainly have figured that stocks 
would be in a deep slump. 
</P>
<P>
 So why has the bear been kept at bay? Analysts point to an extraordinarily 
fortunate confluence of events this year: Corporate earnings growth has vastly 
exceeded expectations, individuals have continued to pump cash into stock 
mutual funds, and institutional investors have shown a surprising unwillingness 
to walk away from their favorite stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet as 1995 looms, many investment pros believe the market's luck has nearly 
run out. The increasingly prevalent view is that stocks are at risk of a 
significant selloff soon whether interest rates rise further or fall. 
</P>
<P>
 William Dodge, market strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York, sees the 
key problem now as one of basic valuation -- weighing stocks' appeal versus 
that of bonds and bank CDs. 
</P>
<P>
 As bond yields rise, investors naturally pay lower prices for stocks relative 
to earnings per share. That has in fact happened this year. At the start of the 
year, the S&P 500 index was priced at 16.4 times the S&P companies' 1993 
operating earnings. Today, the index is priced at 14.4 times estimated 1994 
operating earnings, according to brokerage Goldman Sachs & Co.'s estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks' earnings "multiple" is a product of simple division, so it can drop in 
one of two ways: Either stock prices decline, or earnings rise. This year, 
earnings have risen so powerfully -- thanks to the healthy economy -- that the 
S&P multiple has fallen even as stock prices have stayed virtually level. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, investors have been able to convince themselves that they're 
actually paying "less" for stocks by paying the same price, because earnings 
have grown. 
</P>
<P>
 But with 30-year T-bond yields at 8.15% and three-month T-bills yielding 5.3%, 
Dodge sees more investors questioning whether the average stock is worth 14 
times earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Even allowing for further corporate profit growth in 1995, he says, "the 
bottom line on the valuation backdrop today is that we are at the same levels 
relative to interest rates . . . that preceded the 1990, 1987, 1983-84, 1980-82 
and early-70s market declines." 
</P>
<P>
 While other Wall Streeters will debate whether 14 times earnings is expensive 
or fair, Dodge's point is that there is very little wiggle room left. "Can 
(stocks) move higher in the current environment? Sure, but not without getting 
more and more overvalued and presenting more and more risk," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Geraldine Weiss, editor of Investment Quality Trends newsletter in La Jolla 
and a bear, believes that interest rates have hit levels that will induce a 
major change in investor psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 Most investors know, Weiss says, that the market's "internals" have been 
deteriorating this year. Though key stock indexes have held up, the ratio of 
declining stocks to advancing stocks in the broad market has ballooned. Yet the 
relative health of the 30 stocks in the Dow industrial index has given 
investors something hopeful to cling to, Weiss says. 
</P>
<P>
 But with short-term interest rates double where they were a year ago, Weiss 
expects the still-strong flow of small investors' dollars into stock funds to 
ebb soon. That would take a crucial element of support away from the market. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can earn 6% on a one-year bank CD, Weiss says, "why on Earth take a 
chance in a risky and overvalued stock market?" 
</P>
<P>
 The bulls might answer her with this: Interest rates are peaking. Their next 
major move is down. 
</P>
<P>
 But if that's the case, some investment pros say, the stock market is still a 
loser's game now. Why? Because if interest rates begin to drop, Wall Street's 
automatic assumption will be that the economy is finally slowing. And if 
business slows, so will corporate earnings growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts already are estimating that S&P 500 earnings growth will decline in 
1995 to 13.7% from this year's expected 17% rise, according to earnings-tracker 
Zacks Investment Research in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 If in the wake of recent strong economic reports the Federal Reserve Board 
raises rates dramatically at its Nov. 15 meeting -- say, by a full percentage 
point instead of the usual half-point -- it's conceivable that investors could 
view that increase as the last one. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, expectations for a meaningful economic slowdown in '95 could 
escalate. And the optimistic outlook for corporate earnings would begin to 
evaporate, casting a chill over stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Applegate, investment strategist at CS First Boston in New York, 
thinks the stock market is set up to have its earnings-driven bullishness 
"dashed over the next few months" as investors focus on high real interest 
rates and slowing earnings growth. In the process, he said, he believes the Dow 
could slide as much as 400 points, or 10.5%, to about 3,400. 
</P>
<P>
 That wouldn't be the end of the world, Applegate notes. Assuming the economy 
slows in 1995 but avoids recession, stocks' bull market could easily resume 
from lower levels -- just as stocks recovered after the Dow's 10% drop in 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The big question is whether a Dow decline of several hundred points would set 
off a dangerous chain reaction at this point in the market cycle, with interest 
rates offering steep competition for stocks and the best news in corporate 
earnings growth almost certainly behind us. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss notes that the Dow, as the most-watched index, can cut both ways: It can 
give investors a false sense of security if it stays up while other indexes 
decline. And it can deepen any turn to bearishness if it plunges, even if the 
rest of the market initially holds up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the Dow capitulates and it becomes widely recognized that we're in a 
bear market, an element of panic can set in," Weiss warns. 
</P>
<P>
 One ominous sign for the market is that investor psychology, although still 
positive toward stocks, has become a game of reaching for reasons to stay 
bullish, argues Richard McCabe, market analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear money managers say now, 'It's not worthwhile getting out and then 
trying to get back in,' " he says. Others will insist that "the market is bad, 
but the outlook for my stocks is good." 
</P>
<P>
 More worrisome, McCabe says, is that many money managers tell him that they 
are inclined to sell but that their clients won't go along with that decision. 
"They say that their clients are telling them that this is still a great 
long-term bull market and that they want to stay invested in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the market can turn, "investor psychology has to finally change," 
McCabe says. "People have to begin to feel that the greater risk is losing 
money, not missing the potential upside." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the bulls may have it right after all. If the Fed engineers a "soft 
landing" for the economy, if inflation stays low, if bond yields drop, if the 
corporate profits trend remains up and if there are no global political shocks, 
the end of this bull market may not yet be on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 The market's doubters say the problem is that there are just too many "ifs" in 
that equation to give them any real comfort with stocks when a bank now will 
offer them 6% risk-free.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE; SHAKEN INTO A SAFETY MIND-SET; RETAILERS ARE 
CASHING IN ON DISASTER PREPAREDNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Safety stores are bursting forth around Southern California like 
post-earthquake fissures in unreinforced masonry. 
</P>
<P>
 These are save-yourself-from-disaster retailers selling a 
best-defense-is-a-good-offense strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Stumble into the three Be Ready Disaster Preparedness stores and stumble out 
with water-purification tablets, pepper spray or freeze-dried M.R.E., meals 
just like those enjoyed by U.S. military personnel. Lurch into the Q-Safety 
store in Pasadena to find ways of earthquake-proofing nearly everything except 
the water in your aquarium. Wander into Family First in West Los Angeles and 
learn about every hazard known to baby while signing up for CPR classes. 
</P>
<P>
 This is truly a Southern California phenomenon, catering to -- depending how 
you look at it -- either the region's well-reasoned need to be prepared for the 
worst or its deep-rooted paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little niche market that became very viable after the (Northridge) 
earthquake," said John Golisch, a Southland-based partner specializing in 
retailing for the Arthur Andersen & Co. accounting firm. "I suspect they're 
probably doing a pretty good business." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of consultants specialize in the business of disaster recovery and 
preparedness, said Mike Beckerle, editor of a St. Louis-based quarterly called 
Disaster Recovery Journal. But, Beckerle noted, "we haven't heard of too many 
actual retail stores." 
</P>
<P>
 But such stores appear to be proliferating in these parts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disasters have been very good to us," allows Adolf Singh, who began selling 
safety merchandise three years ago out of a mall cart with his partner and 
brother-in-law Al Cabacungan. Now the pair has full-fledged Be Ready Disaster 
Preparedness stores in Oceanside, Manhattan Beach and Sherman Oaks -- the last 
two sprouting after the Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got into it when we realized that when you try to get prepared, it is very 
difficult to get all the supplies in one location," Singh said. "The Northridge 
earthquake really shook people up, and the interest has continued." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Rundberg became interested in earthquake preparation during the 1987 
Whittier Narrows quake as he watched a heavy entertainment center sway, 
threatening to topple onto the small coffee table that was sheltering his young 
daughter. The entertainment center remained upright, but that moment of fear 
pushed Rundberg, then a manufacturer of computer furniture, into a frustrating 
search for devices to secure his home furnishings in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Rundberg eventually invented his own products -- most of which involve 
combinations of plastic fasteners, Velcro, woven fabric straps, and metal nuts 
and bolts -- and formed a company called Q-Safety, which manufactures the 
devices, distributes them to retailers and sells them out of a tiny factory 
store in Pasadena. Q-Safety sells kits to secure televisions, computer 
equipment, refrigerators, filing cabinets and all sorts of furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 And the store, which is constantly busy, frequently turns into an impromptu 
therapy session for the quake-scarred. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stories that we've heard are amazing," Rundberg said. "People are making 
friends in the store." 
</P>
<P>
 Rundberg said his sales have quadrupled since Jan. 17 and will surpass $1 
million this year. And while awareness of earthquake safety has "improved 
tremendously," that doesn't always translate into action, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of interest," Rundberg said, "but I know a lot of my friends 
haven't done it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick and Linette Palmer turned their baby-proofing consulting business into 
the Family First retail store last August, carrying, or representing, a variety 
of products aimed at preventing a myriad of hazards: toilet lid locks to keep 
baby out, cabinet latches, earthquake kits, plexiglass for stair-rails and 
balconies, pool fencing, carbon monoxide monitors, lead testing kits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole purpose of the store is to give people a large selection to 
baby-proof and make things safer," he said. "People don't want to go to five or 
six different places." Palmer demonstrates products for do-it-yourselfers or 
will do the installation on a contract basis. The store also features a small 
classroom for CPR or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, first aid and other 
lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really want to provide a service," Palmer said. "We don't try to scare 
people. The bottom line is you can't protect your children from everything. We 
try to make it a little bit safer." 
</P>
<P>
 Plastic surgeon Christine Petti said that hiring Palmer to baby-proof her home 
and earthquake-proof her office and operating room gave her peace of mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was totally panicked with my first child, plus you go through the guilt 
thing because you aren't there all the time to protect them," said Petti, who 
recently gave birth to a second child. "It took a tremendous pressure off me 
and my husband," a cardiovascular surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether these stores will survive the competitive Southern California retail 
market long enough for the next natural disaster is anybody's guess. Many 
hardware, home improvement and discount stores are also getting into the 
preparedness act, Golisch said, adding that he suspects safety items like 
earthquake kits will be popular holiday gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce and David Lebanoff have been through this business cycle before. Because 
they "got scared into this business by an earthquake," the pair opened their 
Earthquake Preparedness Products store in Santa Ana eight years ago and they've 
seen competitors come and go, Joyce Lebanoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The longer you go away from an earthquake, the less business you have," she 
said. "The longer you wait to (buy earthquake preparation products), the less 
likely you are to do it. It's insurance and it's really important. People 
should be ready, especially people with kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Does this mean Southern Californians are turning into a collection of 
neurotics and survivalists, or are we simply doing the things that experts have 
always recommended? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of like the nuclear fallout shelters of the '50s," Golisch said. 
"What they've done is heightened the awareness and put a focus on what you need 
to do. . . . It never hurts to be prepared."

 20th Century Rebate: Earthquake-battered insurance holding company 20th 
Century Industries will be in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Thursday 
asking Judge Dzintra Janavs to stay the California Supreme Court's Aug. 18 
ruling that 20th Century must pay $120 million in rebates to policyholders 
under Proposition 103, the 1988 insurance rate-cutting initiative. Woodland 
Hills-based 20th Century wants the delay in order to appeal the case to the 
U.S. Supreme Court. Lawyers for Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi said they 
believe Janavs lacks the authority to issue a stay and will ask her to 
implement the California decision immediately.

 New Player in Consumer Electronics: Best Buy Co., the nation's second-largest 
specialty retailer of consumer electronics, will enter the Southern California 
market by opening seven stores Friday. The Minneapolis-based discount chain 
will open Best Buy stores in Mission Viejo, West Covina, City of Industry, 
Palmdale, Rancho Cucamonga, Hawthorne and Torrance.The company, which plans to 
open five more stores by spring, has said it expects to have a total of 20 
Southland stores by the end of 1995. Best Buy's move into Southern California 
is expected to escalate the price war among consumer electronics chains in the 
region. With chains such as Circuit City, Good Guys and Adray's, Southern 
California already has one of the most competitive consumer electronics markets 
in the country, industry experts say.

 Multimedia Conference: In another example of the convergence of Hollywood and 
Silicon Valley, Mountain View, Calif.-based In Silicon Graphics Inc. will hold 
its "Silicon Studio" conference Tuesday through Friday at the Westin 
Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles. About 1,200 people are expected to attend the 
convention, which is aimed in part at enticing the Southland's creative 
community to use the computer firm's equipment in developing entertainment 
products in a digital environment. On Thursday, exhibitions demonstrating 
innovations in film and video publishing, interactive games, location-based 
entertainment and virtual reality will be open to the public.

 Another GM Strike Threatened: Employees at the General Motors Corp. truck 
assembly factory in Janesville, Wis., voted to strike unless the company hires 
more people, a union spokesman said. The assembly-line workers object to long 
overtime hours, a complaint that led to a temporary walkout of GM workers in 
Flint, Mich., earlier this year. The plant has a work force of 5,000 producing 
GMC Suburbans and medium-weight trucks.

 A pending joint venture would make R.J. Reynolds Tobacco International Inc. 
the first U.S. firm to make and sell its cigarette brands in Vietnam, a company 
spokeswoman said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 R.J. Reynolds Tobacco International, a unit of RJR Nabisco Inc., planned to 
sign a $21.2-million joint venture agreement Sunday with officials in central 
Vietnam.Company spokeswoman Jan Fulton said she could not confirm that the 
agreement had been signed as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The venture would establish a factory that would produce 3.3 billion 
cigarettes a year and a tobacco plantation of 9,900 acres, Fulton said. 
</P>
<P>
 R.J. Reynolds would own 70% of the new firm, to be called the R.J. 
Reynolds-Danang Joint Venture. Its partner, the Danang Cigarette Factory, will 
hold the remaining 30%. Final approval for the project must come from the State 
Committee For Cooperation and Investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on a factory will begin in early 1995 if the joint venture is 
approved by the state committee by the end of the year, Fulton said.

AIR FARES MAY GO UP -- EXCEPT IN CALIFORNIA; AIRLINES: CARRIERS HOPE TO EXTEND 
RECENT FINANCIAL COMEBACK. PRICES ON SOME ROUTES HAVE RISEN ALREADY.

<P>
 The recent relentless wave of air fare cuts may be starting to ebb -- except 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
 After a year of offering steep discounts to attract passengers, the nation's 
major airlines are preparing to raise ticket prices on selected routes in an 
effort to extend the industry's recent financial comeback. Some fares have 
already been raised. 
</P>
<P>
 In California and the West, however, analysts expect the fare wars to 
continue, as no-frills leader Southwest Airlines does battle with United 
Airlines' recently inaugurated shuttle service. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts said that Dallas-based Southwest is likely to raise fares in its core 
Texas markets and other regions to subsidize cheap prices on the West Coast. 
Southwest currently offers one-way fares as low as $39 for travel anywhere it 
flies within California, with a 21-day advance ticket purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest has said it will likely raise prices on some routes next year. 
Continental and other airlines also are expected to hike fares on certain 
heavily traveled routes where the change is unlikely to discourage passengers 
from traveling, industry experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 They also said travelers will still be able to find bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cities with the lowest fares have probably hit rock bottom, except for 
some promotional fares," said Tom Parsons, editor of Best Fares, a 
discount-travel magazine. "There will still be special fares that pop up on 
occasion, but the everyday low fares will see a minimal increase." 
</P>
<P>
 Higher fares will be a welcome change for the industry. After losing $10 
billion in the early 1990s, the airlines are again showing profit gains thanks 
to aggressive cost-cutting. But they're also complaining that continued low 
ticket prices are keeping a lid on their sales growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental in effect proposed a price increase late Thursday. It said it 
plans to scale back its much touted Continental Lite service at least 20%, in 
order to help the operation turn a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston-based Continental basically split itself in half a year ago by 
starting the low-price Lite service, which focuses on East Coast markets. The 
service has struggled to break even, and new Continental President Gordon 
Bethune said fares on some of the remaining Lite routes might be raised to 
generate extra revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Continental Lite already had raised fares modestly in some Florida 
markets in the last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Raising fares on some of routes may be the only way Continental Lite can make 
those flights profitable, since costs already are low and traffic is heavy, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Continental Lite) has a lot of adjusting to do," said Michael 
Derchin, an analyst at NatWest Securities in New York. "I think there will be a 
lot of pressure at Continental to raise air fares." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the low prices have generated traffic, analysts said it's nearly 
impossible to earn a profit on the cheap flights no matter how much the 
airlines cut their costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Price increases "will be a positive," said Ray Neidl, an analyst at the 
securities firm Furman Selz Inc. in New York. He said some of the current low 
fares are "ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Delta Air Lines spokesman Bill Berry agreed: "If there are some upward 
adjustments, it will simply reflect what the cost of providing the service is. 
If the bottom level of fares can come up that's good news, because they are 
rock bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, analysts said the airlines won't want to jeopardize their traffic 
gains by raising fares too much. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to get prices up to an economic level and only lose a marginal 
amount of traffic," Neidl said.

FOREIGN INVESTMENT SHIFTING TO EAST COAST, REPORT FINDS; ECONOMY: ANALYSTS SAY 
OTHER COUNTRIES' INCREASED INTEREST IN HIGH TECHNOLOGY BODES WELL FOR 
CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Foreign investment in the United States is increasingly shifting to the East 
Coast. And the Japanese, who spent big in California for a decade or so, are 
now spending most of their money at home or in other Asian countries. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither trend, highlighted in a recent report on foreign investment, is 
necessarily bad news for California, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Another change, according to the report from International Business magazine 
and consulting firm Arthur Andersen, is increased foreign interest in high 
technology, which bodes well for California in the long term because the state 
is home to a strong technology industry, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining investment from Japan is the major reason New York and Texas 
surpassed California to garner the larger share of the more than $26.2 billion 
foreigners spent in 1993 to buy into U.S. companies and real estate, the report 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Japan sneezes, California kind of catches a cold," said Andrew Kane, a 
partner at Arthur Andersen. "Japan has gone through a downbeat time in the last 
12 to 16 months, and the amount of capital available to invest has been less." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say Japan may gradually increase its U.S. investment but that it will 
probably never return to the level of the 1980s, when the California real 
estate market was flooded with yen. The level of Japanese direct investment in 
the United States fell to $1.85 billion in 1992 from $20 billion in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Direct investment in the U.S. was powered by the bubble economy in Japan, and 
now the bubble has burst," said Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic 
Strategy Institute in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 California, meanwhile, has suffered its own woes, chiefly a struggle to 
attract foreign investment in manufacturing. According to the report, 
foreigners last year invested 47% of their money in manufacturing, far more 
than all other industries. 
</P>
<P>
 British investors, who by the end of the year may dethrone the Japanese as the 
largest single source of foreign capital, can take credit for 113,000 jobs in 
California, Kane said. But the figures show Britain and other European 
countries seem to be attracted to East Coast cities such as New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Kyser, chief economist with Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles 
County, said California is suffering from an image problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "In practically every national report on California's recession, you hear the 
words riots or fires in the first sentence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists said, however, that California will not sustain irreparable damage 
from the lost revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "California is definitely in a recovery mode," Kyser said. "As the word gets 
out, people are going to once again invest."

 A Push for Casinos in Israel: Israel could become a major gambling center for 
the Middle East, generating up to $1 billion a year with ancillary services, 
foreign experts said at an international business conference in Jerusalem. 
Israel's perceived stability has already attracted the attention of such gaming 
industry developers as Donald Trump and Sol Kerzner, according to Salomon Bros. 
The Israeli government has already begun discussions on whether to allow 
gambling in the Jewish state.

 Gasoline Prices Head Upward: The retail price rose 1 1/2 cents a gallon during 
the past two weeks, reversing a trend of falling prices that began in late 
August, according to a newsletter.The average pump price on Friday was $1.22 a 
gallon, up 1.53 cents from Oct. 21, said Trilby Lundberg, whose publication 
conducts a survey of 10,000 gas stations nationwide. The primary reason for the 
increase was the federally mandated sale of more costly oxygenated gasoline, 
Lundberg said. Prices can be expected to rise again with the Jan. 1 
implementation of federal requirements to sell reformulated gas.

ONE LAST GASP FOR THE BULL MARKET? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even some of Wall Street's biggest naysayers on stocks say the market could 
enjoy one final big rally before it stumbles into a full-fledged bear phase. 
</P>
<P>
 Why a "last gasp"? First, a shift by the electorate to mostly Republican 
candidates in Tuesday's election could thrill the market at least temporarily 
by promising a turn to the kind of conservatism that Wall Street normally 
applauds -- lower taxes, smaller government, a stronger military. 
</P>
<P>
 The fine print entailed in such a conservative turn -- for example, the 
potential for a bigger federal budget deficit -- would probably be ignored in 
the initial euphoria over a Republican win, some analysts figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the December-through-January period is traditionally strong for the 
stock market, as investors generally approach the new year with optimism. 
Stocks beaten down in tax-related year-end selling often are snapped up by 
bargain-hunters in late December and in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, because many stock portfolios (including the typical mutual fund) are 
down only slightly this year, fund managers haven't suffered enough 
psychologically to prejudice them from jumping aboard any rally that might get 
started. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, with managers' bonuses dependent on their performance, any 
opportunity to post a gain this year will probably be seized upon. "If you see 
someone else doing it (leaping into stocks), you'll have to do it too," says 
Michael Kucera, research chief at Wedge Capital Management in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 But with stocks' price-to-earnings ratios at levels that at best indicate a 
fair valuation for the market and at worst indicate overvalue, any surge in 
stock prices from current levels will merely heighten the risk of a deeper 
decline early in 1995, Wall Street bears say. Their simple message is that it 
isn't worth trying to get on board for another 5% gain, if a 15% decline will 
soon follow. TOM PETRUNO

TOOTHPASTE STARS AT TRADE FAIR IN VIETNAM; IMPORTS: CLOTHES WERE ALSO POPULAR 
AT THE 4-DAY U.S. EXHIBIT ORGANIZED BY A SAN DIEGO-BASED FIRM.

 Children's clothes from Florida were popular, but toothpaste was the star of 
the first U.S. trade fair in this former capital of South Vietnam since the 
Vietnam War ended in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like this exhibition very much," said Tran Thi Anh Vu, 19, who was among 
mobs of Vietnamese who turned out last week to admire goods displayed at 
Vietnamerica Expo '94. "With this exhibition, I think Vietnam will have good 
relations with Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 American products are nothing new to Ho Chi Minh City, known as Saigon when it 
was the capital of the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese government up until 1975. 
Some of the goods at the fair were available on city streets even before 
Washington lifted its 19-year-old trade embargo against Vietnam in February. 
</P>
<P>
 But prices on the street are often inflated, making fair-goers eager to snap 
up the display samples at wholesale prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's cheaper and better quality," said Pham Phuong Hoa, 21. She carried off 
two shopping bags filled with Colgate toothpaste and liquid Palmolive soap. 
Tubes of toothpaste were being sold for 10,000 dong, or nearly $1, half the 
price on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam Investment Information & Consulting, based in San Diego, organized the 
four-day exhibit as a follow-up to the country's first post-war American trade 
fair, held in April in Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
 The new exhibit is being held on the balloon-festooned grounds of Ho Chi Minh 
City's former Presidential Palace, now called Reunification Palace. The palace 
gate was stormed by North Vietnamese tanks on April 30, 1975, toppling the 
South Vietnamese government and ending both the war and the city's heavy 
American presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham Chanh Truc, vice chairman of the city government, opened the fair by 
welcoming back U.S. businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps Ho Chi Minh City will become a good environment . . . for the 
American business community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles E. Rainey, chairman of Florida's St. Petersburg-Clearwater Economic 
Development Council, was just as upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to keep people employed in our county by exporting and 
importing," he said. "Hopefully we can create a market." 
</P>
<P>
 One booth displayed children's clothes made by Pixie Playmates of Florida. 
After fair-goers clamored to buy the samples, the Americans finally relented 
and sold more than 100 of them for $2 to $3 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 "They loved it," said Frank Novak, secretary-treasurer of Tampa Bay 
International, a distributor. 
</P>
<P>
 However, U.S. businessmen are no longer quite as euphoric as they were 10 
months ago when President Clinton lifted the trade embargo. Many companies' 
applications to form joint ventures or develop real estate have bogged down in 
the Vietnamese bureaucracy, and post-embargo investment is still less than $40 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade also remains low, although the Vietnamese government has yet to release 
figures.TRADE SHOWS

 News Corp. Stock Offering Well Received: Media titan Rupert Murdoch scored an

preferred limited voting shares, which carry less voting power than ordinary 
shares, were widely sought on the Australian Stock Exchange.

STREET SMART: ARROWS, MARKERS NOW IDENTIFY NEWPORT BLVD. LEFT-TURN LANES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 About a year ago I wrote you regarding the situation at Newport Boulevard and 
Fair Drive in Costa Mesa. The condition still exists with apparently no effort 
to correct it, either on the part of the state or the city of Costa Mesa. As a 
result, someone has created a dangerous traffic situation. 
</P>
<P>
 When traveling north on Newport Boulevard, one comes to the light at Fair 
Drive. The left lane is clearly marked with two signs stating "Left Turn Only." 
However, drivers either don't see them, or disregard them if they do, and 
proceed directly ahead through the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Boulevard was recently repaved and the left-turn arrows on the road 
have not been repainted. But even when they were there, the same condition 
existed. 
</P>
<P>
 Why can't they put up the plastic pipe cones, such as they have as you depart 
Coast Highway onto Dover Drive in Newport Beach? Short of that, take the "Left 
Turn Only" signs down. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwight Gick 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Street Smart passed along your letter to Caltrans, and since then Caltrans has 
repainted the left-turn arrows and placed Botts Dotts to further guide drivers 
on the left-turn-only lane. 
</P>
<P>
 For an extra mental nudge for northbound Newport Boulevard drivers, Caltrans 
has also painted a right arrow on the pavement of the furthermost left lane so 
through traffic knows to merge right if they want to continue on Newport 
Boulevard. If they don't merge, they must turn left onto Fair Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Using plastic pipe cones, called "channelizers," is not practical at this 
location, Caltrans spokeswoman Rose Orem said. The channelizers wouldn't give 
motorists on the northbound Costa Mesa Freeway off-ramp flowing to Newport 
Boulevard enough room to merge. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 When you exit Interstate 5 at Lake Forest Drive and cross Lake Forest Drive 
onto Avenida de la Carlota, immediately there is a speed limit sign that states 
45 m.p.h. About 30 feet further, there is another sign that states the speed 
limit is 30 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 This is ridiculous. Why isn't the 45 m.p.h. sign moved to around the two 
upcoming bends where it makes a little more sense? 
</P>
<P>
 Dale E. Cornelison 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills 
</P>
<P>
 On the strength of your letter, Orange County's Traffic Engineering Department 
conducted an investigation and agreed with you that the signs are close, 
although not as close as you think. But, because of the geography of the road, 
there may not be enough room to place them farther apart.  
</P>
<P>
 Ignacio Ochoa, Orange County's traffic engineer, says that a survey years ago 
determined that 45 m.p.h. was the appropriate maximum speed for Avenida de la 
Carlota. Thus, a black and white "regulatory" speed limit sign was posted. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30 m.p.h. "advisory" sign was posted about 200 feet beyond the speed limit 
sign to alert drivers to upcoming curves in the road. This yellow and black 
sign is not mandatory but acts as a gentle suggestion to motorists that they 
may want to go slower than the maximum speed to more easily maneuver some 
feature in the road. 
</P>

 Senior citizens and people with disabilities may obtain a reduced fare 
identification card at the Orange County Transportation Authority offices,

 The card costs $2, and card holders pay only 45 cents during peak bus hours (6 
to 9 a.m. and 3 to 6 p.m.) on Mondays through Fridays, and 15 cents at all 
other times.

 It might not have the same sense of history as the Berlin Wall or the Great 
Wall of China. 
</P>
<P>
 But to Rossmoor residents, a 1 1/2-mile red brick wall that surrounds their 
community is special. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the 36-year-old wall has fallen on hard times. A section of 
the wall collapsed during a 1992 earthquake. Other portions are in danger of 
toppling as well. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Rossmoor voters are being asked to put their money where their 
heart is. Measure K and Measure L would authorize the Rossmoor Community 
Services District to maintain the wall and charge property owners $1.25 a month 
in a special tax to pay for the upkeep. Today

 A sports memorabilia auction for the Make-A-Wish Foundation featuring

 The auction will take place during the "Monday Night Football" game. All 
proceeds will be donated to the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Orange County, which 
grants the wishes of children suffering from terminal or life-threatening 
illnesses. Information: (714) 476-9474.

RAMS 27, DENVER BRONCOS 21; RAM REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First Quarter: Fans entering Anaheim Stadium Sunday were given Pro Bowl 
ballots and advised they were eligible to win a free trip to Honolulu for the 
game. Odds of winning were not specified, but even at one-in-million it beats 
Wayne Gandy's chances of being there. . . . Chris Chandler, who replaced a 
groggy Chris Miller as starting quarterback, is on the Pro Bowl ballot. Miller 
isn't. Huh? Ram PR spokesman said it was team's decision to forward just 
Chandler's name; that's right, there was never any truth to those reports that 
Chuck Knox wanted Chandler as his starter the rest of the year. . . . Wide 
receiver Todd Kinchen leaves line of scrimmage early, gets penalized, comes 
back on next play for 43-yard reception. This is known as the Kancatch 
Redemption. . . . Weren't they still playing baseball the last time Jerome 
Bettis scored a TD. . . . Chandler runs draw for 22 yards; Ground Chuck says, 
"That's my guy." . . . Rams 7, Broncos 0. 
</P>
<P>
 Second Quarter: Howard Griffith catches TD pass. He plays for the Rams. . . . 
Chris Chandler is outplaying John Elway. J.T. Snow hit better than Don 
Mattingly -- for a month. . . . Bettis fumbles; one more and Howard gets the 
ball. . . . Denver has only 60 yards in offense -- is Tommy Maddox stealing 
their signals? . . . Elway throws misguided pass, gets lucky because it hits 
Anthony Newman in his hands, falls incomplete. . . . Contestants for Punt, Pack 
& Move contest at halftime make their way to field. . . . Rams 17, Broncos 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Third Quarter: Chandler runs QB sneak, gets concussion, then throws 30-yard TD 
pass to Flipper Anderson. Claims later he knew what he was doing. . . . Elway 
now has Rams just where he wants them -- up by 21 points. . . . Miller's not 
sure where he is, but he goes in for a woozy Chandler. What does that tell you 
about Maddox? . . . George Foreman wins heavyweight championship at age 45; 
Gandy starts eating cheeseburgers. . . . Chandler has now thrown for 223 yards, 
making New Orleans' linebacker Ernest Dixon Ram MVP for knocking Miller out. . 
. . Elway won't have to worry about losing another Super Bowl this year. . . . 
Rams 24, Broncos 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth Quarter: Wymon Henderson enters game, Broncos begin comeback. . . . 
Glyn Millburn is wide open, scores, must have been Wymon's guy. . . . Derek 
Russell scores TD, must have been Wymon's guy. . . . Shannon Sharpe catches 
two-point conversion and just where was Wymon? . . . Ram reverse sprung by 
Chandler block. Ground Chuck smiles, "That's my guy." . . . Bettis stopped 
three straight times at goal line, Drayton has tantrum, Knox has excuse to omit 
him from game plan next week. . . . Surprise, surprise, Elway throws to Wymon's 
guy on fourth down, Wymon's guy tries diving catch, can't. So what did you 
expect? . . . Rams 27, Broncos 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Game Summary: St. Louis, Baltimore, Oakland? Rams (4-5) versus Raiders (4-5). 
Loser leaves town.

 Caroline Cotten Nakken and Sandra Cotten never buy anything they haven't 
already sampled. And, they're betting lots of other Southern California 
consumers feel exactly the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, their hunch has paid off big time. The two sisters-in-law have spent 
the past 16 years turning a fledging operation run out of a spare bedroom into 
a multimillion-dollar business based on a simple premise: "Try it, you'll like 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Their company, Sunshine Promotions Inc., hires up to 4,000 contract employees 
each weekend who work in grocery stores, movie theaters and even school 
cafeterias throughout Southern California, peddling free samples of products 
for such high-profile clients as Procter & Gamble Co., General Mills Inc. and 
Colgate-Palmolive Co. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1993 revenues of more than $5 million, the profitable company has a team 
of 40 full-time workers in its Anaheim headquarters. The two women have now 
formed another company, Mass Connections, which offers similar in-store direct 
marketing services nationwide. And Cotten, 48, and Nakken, 40, are brushing up 
on foreign-language study in anticipation of one day expanding their operations 
internationally. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair attribute their success to hard work, staying focused and getting in 
on the ground floor of a growing industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would you really buy something that you haven't tried?" Nakken asked. "I have 
four children, and I am very hesitant to buy anything I haven't tried. But if a 
friend tells me or I try it, then I am your typical repeat purchaser." 
</P>
<P>
 The marketing industry for in-store samples and coupons is expected to grow at 
an annual rate of 11.7% between 1993 and 1997, according to a study by Clayton, 
Curtis & Cottrell, a Colorado marketing firm. Nearly 80% of consumers said that 
when they take a sample during a demonstration that they buy the product if 
they need it, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an industry that's alive and flourishing," said Robert Lieberman, 
president of the National Assn. of Demonstration Companies, a trade group 
formed nine years ago that now has 150-member companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sunshine is one of the most progressive companies we have. You're talking 
about one of the brightest lights in our industry," Lieberman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunshine's employees pass out samples of everything from chips and salsa to 
health and beauty items. The employees collect data on consumers' interest and 
comments about a product. The comments are tabulated and reported back to the 
company the next day. Sunshine also works with the sponsoring company on 
marketing plans -- printing coupons and devising ways to educate consumers. 
Sometimes a company will change the product based on early response from 
in-store marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very innovative, creative and hard-working," said Terry Fyffe, a 
vice president of sales with Bradshaw Inc., a Santa Fe Springs food broker that 
hires Sunshine for in-store marketing for their large manufacturing clients in 
1,400 grocery stores in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Fyffe praised Cotten and Nakken for coming up with a marketing technique 
called "recipe rebate," where in-store consumers are given a recipe, plus 
coupons for at least four items in the recipe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very effective," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunshine Promotions' employees work from 6 to 18 hours a week, an ideal job 
for students, mothers, senior citizens -- anyone who wants to supplement their 
income, Cotten said. 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes, a part-time employee doesn't work out. Like the demonstrator 
who decided to invite his wife to the grocery store, order in a pizza and sit 
down for dinner during work hours, Cotten said. Or the surfer from Huntington 
Beach who reported a "massive" inventory of product samples at the beginning of 
his shift. At the end he told the company his inventory was "still massive." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had every type of person doing this, and it's really a people 
business," Nakken said. "We've had people where the store falls in love with 
them and people who are no longer with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the two women never forget the early days, when they were working out 
of their homes and often told clients who telephoned that those noisy children 
in the background were just broken copy machines. Or the years they went 
without salaries and the nights spent supplementing their incomes by working as 
bartenders and cocktail waitresses. They even tried to cut down on food costs 
by eating the samples they passed out in grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really hand-to-mouth in those days," Nakken said. "We sometimes ate 
the beans we were marketing. And we were always on the verge of closing the 
doors." 
</P>
<P>
 The two became sisters-in-law after Nakken, then Cotten's next-door neighbor 
in Phoenix, introduced Cotten to her brother, Mike. Nakken started the company 
in Phoenix in 1976, and Cotten joined her two years later. Sunshine was 
officially incorporated in 1981 in California. "We both had the desire to be 
our own boss, and we liked the challenge created by forming your own destiny. 
We love it. We're working with new products all the time," Cotten said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two say their partnership works because they are good at different things; 
Cotten is the business planner and Nakken provides the sales and promotional 
expertise. But because neither Cotten nor Nakken finished college, they said 
that they were plagued with doubts when starting their business. 
</P>
<P>
 "You question yourself all the time -- are you good enough, are you smart 
enough? But the question is not are you good enough -- it's about the desire to 
make your business succeed," Nakken said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunshine charges its clients a base weekend rate of about $88 for a six-hour 
promotion. The retail client must also pay access fees to the grocery store of 
about $40 per day. Sunshine competes with other demonstration companies, 
including KDS Inc. of Orange, which conducts about 3,000 demonstrations every 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "SPI is a worthy competitor and we do battle with them on a daily basis," said 
Todd Priest, an account executive at KDS. "This is a business that is really 
changing and getting more competitive every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Cotten and Nakken attribute their success to the support of their families and 
the fact that they chose a growth industry -- one they think will only 
continuing growing. 
</P>
<P>
 "With money being so tight, consumers are more and more cautious," Cotten 
said. "When I'm in the store, I will go with the product that we already like, 
unless I've tried a new product. I don't want my family to say, 'Yuck.' That's 
why you need to try new things." Sunshine Promotions Inc.

</P>
<P>
 How did you get started? I had worked for promotional agencies as a first job. 
I started this company just doing promotions, then really fell into the grocery 
side of the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Where did you get financing? Our own back pockets. Also through loans from 
family and friends. One was for $30,000, but we paid it back with interest in 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 What was your biggest challenge? Not getting discouraged. There are days you 
wake up and think, 'If I didn't have to worry about this anymore, my life might 
be easier.' 
</P>
<P>
 What was your biggest mistake? Trying things before we had done enough 
research. We have only had one or two things that took longer than planned, but 
it cost money. 
</P>
<P>
 What was the best advice you received? When we were first starting out and no 
one took us seriously, there was someone who said, 'You're worth it. Don't sell 
yourself short. You can do it.' I still remember him. 
</P>
<P>
 What advice would you give someone now starting out in business? Do your 
research. Really understand the business you're going into. Really understand 
the potential and the liability involved.

to Shop Talk, Los Angeles Times, P.O. Box 2008, Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626. Or

<P>
 Question: I currently work as a gas station mechanic. My hours are 7 a.m. to 
at least 5 p.m. Often, I am "asked" to stay later -- six days a week, and I am 
not paid any overtime pay. My employer does not even have a time clock and 
keeps no accurate record of my hours worked. Is this legal? Also, is it legal 
for shop owners to run special discounts on labor (i.e., brake special for $40 
labor, when the labor guide calls for $82.50 for labor)? 
</P>
<P>
 These specials require me to be paid less than I should receive. Because my 
pay is based on what the shop charges the customer, when the station discounts 
labor, it costs me money. I believe in capitalism, but this is ridiculous. If 
this isn't legal, is there any way of forcing my employer to pay overtime 
without going to the totally useless labor board? 
</P>
<P>
 -- F.G., Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Employers are required to keep records of the hours worked and the 
wages paid. Although the exact method that your employer uses to calculate your 
wages is not clear, there does not appear to be any problem with the method 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the total wages paid divided by the hours worked cannot be less than 
the prevailing minimum wage, which is currently $4.25 per hour. Moreover, you 
are generally entitled to overtime pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 
hours per week. Your conclusion that the Department of Labor is "totally 
useless" is unfounded. I think you will find that filing a claim with the 
Department of Labor is the least expensive and most expeditious method for 
resolving any dispute that may arise.

 Question: What are the regulations governing the use of state short-term 
disability benefits? A couple of years ago I was hospitalized for minor 
surgery. I was told by the human resources representative at my former job that 
because I had been admitted to the hospital, I was considered temporarily 
disabled and unable to work. Because of this temporary inability to work, the 
company required me to apply for State Disability Insurance benefits and 
forbade me to use sick time. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, I was again hospitalized. This time, however, the rep for 
my current employer told me that I must deplete all of my accrued sick time 
before applying for SDI. In the meantime, I have used all of my sick time and 
no longer have enough time accrued to even take a day off if I have a cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it possible to retroactively apply for short-term disability benefits? How 
would you recommend I do so when my company does not appear to want to 
cooperate? Obviously, I would prefer to be paid from SDI for the term of my 
illness and attempt to get my sick time credited back to me. Also, in both 
instances, I was a salaried employee. 
</P>
<P>
 -- P.F., Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Under the new Family and Medical Leave Act, an employer may require 
that an employee on a medical leave of absence use up all accrued vacation and 
sick leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, under the facts as you describe them, it does not appear possible to 
apply retroactively for short-term disability benefits. Under California law, 
an individual with an injury not related to work must meet several statutory 
requirements in order to be eligible for State Disability Insurance (SDI) 
benefits. Among these are that you must file the SDI claim not later than 41 
days after the first day for which benefits are payable. It may be too late to 
file for your hospitalization earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, you must have suffered a "wage loss" during the period in which 
benefits are claimed. Since your company provided you with sick pay benefits, 
however, you were ineligible for SDI benefits on each of the days for which you 
received sick pay since you did not meet the statutory requirement of incurring 
a "wage loss." 
</P>
<P>
 California Unemployment Insurance Code section 2656 states that if an employee 
receives "regular wages" during a time of disability, he or she is ineligible 
for SDI benefits because the employee has not suffered a wage loss. Sick pay 
benefits that are approximately equal to an employee's regular pay are deemed 
"regular wages," under this provision.

</P>
<P>
 Question: A question recently came up from one of our employees about how many 
days in a row they can be scheduled to work. Our position is that there is no 
limit on the number of consecutive days worked as long as the employee is paid 
properly for overtime, shift differential, etc. But I thought I read recently 
that there was a limit of 10 days. What is correct? 
</P>
<P>
 -- J.R., Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Neither of your answers is entirely correct. There are California 
labor codes that say every person employed in any occupation is entitled to one 
day's rest in a seven-day work week. Therefore, no employer of labor shall 
cause its employees to work more than six days in a seven-day work week. 
</P>
<P>
 However, an exception can be permitted, allowing an accumulation of days of 
rest when the nature of the job reasonably requires the employee to work seven 
or more consecutive days, provided that in each calendar month the employee 
receive days of rest equivalent to one day's rest in seven, or at least four 
days off each month. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other factors, such as collective-bargaining agreements and health 
and safety concerns, that may alter or modify employee work schedules as well.

HOT JOBS: VIDEO CLERK PUTS CUSTOMER SERVICE IN PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOPE HAMASHIGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kenny Klingele has not yet seen the movie "Clerks," but he insists that he is 
nothing like its character Randall, the twentysomething slacker who works in a 
video store, never arrives on time and, when he is there, refuses to help the 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything runs pretty efficiently around here," said Klingele, one of the 
managers in the video department at The Wherehouse on 17th Street in Costa 
Mesa. Making customers happy, he added, is extremely important because it keeps 
them coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 Klingele said he takes customer service seriously because he thinks his 
customers are the best part of his job in a video store, where he worked first 
as a clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a lot of customers on a first-name basis, and I have met a lot of 
people and become friends with them while working here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Klingele, now 26, started at the Wherehouse five years ago. Like most 
21-year-olds, he said he thought it would be fun to work in a place that sells 
music and rents videos. 
</P>
<P>
 As a manager, his responsibilities expanded. In addition to checking videos in 
and out, Klingele also is responsible for hiring, scheduling and training all 
the clerks. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is looking toward a future working in the buying department of a 
video store company, choosing their film and music titles -- or perhaps one day 
owning his own store. 
</P>
<P>
 In large part because of his customers, Klingele said, he has become a film 
buff and has developed an interest in foreign films. Customers "have educated 
me as much as I educate them," he said. "I don't think I ever rented a foreign 
film before I started working here, but they are very popular at this store." 
OCCUPATION: VIDEO STORE CLERK 
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: Video rental clerks are responsible for signing up 
customers for membership, checking out rented videos and checking them in when 
they are returned. Clerks inspect tapes and ensure they are in proper working 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualifications: No previous experience is required. Video rental clerks only 
need to be able to deal with the public in a friendly manner. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prospects: By 1998, the number of rental clerk jobs is projected to increase 
by 11.1% to 3,100. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: Clerks earn from $4.25 to $5 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: Clerks meet a lot of people, learn about cinema and get to watch a lot 
of films. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: Hours are not always the same from day to day. It can be difficult to 
meet customers' demands, particularly during peak hours when there are numerous 
people to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement: Clerks are often promoted to managers. Managers also are 
promoted to management positions of increasing responsibility at larger 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "You have to be social. This is no place for somebody who is shy or 
does not have good people skills."

THEATER REVIEW; 'TURBO TANZI' GOES TO MAT WITH LIFE'S ILLS AND WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some people wrestle with ideas, some with angels, others with those who would 
hold them down. 
</P>
<P>
 In Claire Luckham's clever and compelling "Turbo Tanzi" at the San Diego 
Repertory Theatre's Lyceum Space, a woman named Tanzi compresses her emotional 
battles into a series of 10 bouts in an actual ring, dating from age 1 to 
adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of a hurt look when baby Tanzi hears that her mother wanted a boy, we 
get Tanzi (Laurie Williams) donning baby bonnet and bloomers to get physically 
pummeled by her mom (Vanessa Townsell-Crisp). And after losing matches with her 
dad (Todd Blakesley), school chum (Robin Sheridan), school psychologist (Spike 
Sorrentino) and chauvinist husband (Tyler Mane), Tanzi finally decides to 
become a fighter and re-christens herself Turbo Tanzi. 
</P>
<P>
 The play debuted in 1978 as "Tuebrook Tanzi, The Venus Fly Trap" and became a 
hit at Liverpool pubs. It subsequently played Manchester, London, New York, 
Dallas and Los Angeles, with directors localizing the title and references. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake. Though a smart idea, "Turbo Tanzi" -- the show -- fights a 
battle of its own against stereotyped characterizations, cliche conflicts and a 
predictable outcome. Though sexism is at the play's core, the main issues have 
evolved since Luckham launched her play, focusing on whether Tanzi will have a 
career or become a housewife. Today's women are tackling more insidious and 
less obvious struggles as well, with glass ceilings and pay issues just being a 
couple.  
</P>
<P>
 And yet, despite these handicaps, this referee would still have to pronounce 
"Turbo Tanzi" a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The performances are terrific, with a special nod going to Williams as the 
fierce, spiky Tanzi overcoming her vulnerabilities to become a winner. 
Williams, who is on course to earn an MFA from UC San Diego in the spring, is a 
talent to watch. She anchors the show emotionally, even as this slender, 
5-foot-4 powerhouse hurls her opponents and takes the bruising falls without a 
glimmer of holding back. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Douglas Jacobs keeps the show percolating humorously, playing to the 
audience, without sacrificing the piece's dark emotional underbelly. Even as we 
laugh, we feel Tanzi's pain and recognize the stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Also impressive is Townsell-Crisp, who plays Tanzi's overpowering mother as 
large as life and twice as natural. Her soaring voice (she does a 
rafter-shaking "Star Spangled Banner" and "Stand by Your Man") does well even 
by the funny, but slight, songs from Chris Monks' original score -- sparklingly 
arranged and directed by Pea Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Blakesley, who plays Tanzi's dad, and Sorrentino as Dr. Grope and the referee 
are both old vets at working crowds and prove themselves ever-adept at getting 
the crowd to cheer, boo and throw popcorn on cue. (Not only is eating allowed 
at this raucous event, there's a refreshment stand in a corner of the theater.) 
Robin Sheridan plays a perfect Platinum Sue, the Other Girl/Other Woman type 
who has dogged Tanzi since girlhood.  
</P>
<P>
 Mane, a professional, well-muscled wrestler at 6-foot-10, 300 pounds, comes 
across as a young Schwarzenegger-in-training in his stage debut. And his fight 
choreography for the "Main Event" between Tanzi and her husband, Dean Rebel, 
looks and sounds like the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 John Redman has built a hoot of a red, white and blue wrestling ring with 
ropes that send the fighters bouncing. Judy Watson's costumes are a 
cartoonishly gaudy treat, accentuated by John Philip Martin's lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 If the conclusion to all this is anticlimactic because, let's face it, this 
final bout is dramatically fixed, this is still a case of the getting there 
being the fun. But best of all, sneakily, despite the broad, loud strokes of 
this "Turbo Tanzi," you may find memories of your own wrestling matches 
sneaking back to haunt you long after these fighters leave the ring.

BILLY MITCHELL: A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS, BEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As jazz music continues to stratify into tight little categories and bands 
look to specialize in their chosen style -- be it swing, trad, be-bop, neo-bop, 
Latin, funk or fusion -- it's refreshing to find a musician such as Billy 
Mitchell, who does it all. 
</P>
<P>
 The keyboardist's first set Saturday at Randell's covered all those bases in a 
good-time presentation that, at places, involved the audience with sing-along 
and finger-snapping chores. Though definitely an attempt to win over the 
dinner-hour crowd, these high jinks did little to obscure the fine musicianship 
coming from the pianist and his long-time associate, saxophonist John Bolivar. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Mitchell's regular bassist Hilliard Wilson and drummer Quentin 
Dennard were absent didn't seem to matter. Mitchell and Bolivar have worked 
together so long that their sounds seemed tied like light and shadow, one 
responding neatly to another. They pulled along replacements Ernest Tibbs on 
electric bass and Greg Brown on drums with strong leads and consistently 
predictable direction. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't hurt the rhythm section's chances that the set consisted of familiar 
tunes and forms. But Mitchell doesn't just call out standards to be played in 
the same old way. He's arranged these classics to suit his style, adding 
inventive touches that required his bassist and drummer to pay close attention. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The be-bop exercise "Cherokee" was framed by phrases from Dizzy Gillespie's 
"Salt Peanuts." Eddie Harris' "Freedom Jazz Dance" was done in funk time, while 
"On Green Dolphin Street" alternated between an earthy, world-beat tempo, which 
Bolivar decorated with toots blown on the detached head of his flute, and the 
more traditional walk time. Throw in a Latin number, a couple of blues, a 
ballad and a pop tune and you've got yourself a well-rounded program. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Mitchell had left at home the second synthesizer, the one he uses to 
fill his songs with strings, brass and other orchestral effects, he still took 
advantage of his primary electronic piano to induce appropriate sounds. On 
vibist Milt Jackson tune "Bag's Groove," Mitchell employed a vibraphone sound 
to bring authenticity to the number. A blues tune was introduced with 
sufficiently honky-tonk tones. 
</P>
<P>
 But his best moments came utilizing straight piano. 
</P>
<P>
 An engagingly rhythmic acoustic player, Mitchell applied those same percussive 
skills to his electric piano, building each solo dramatically with strong 
right-hand phrases and swelling chordal exchanges while decorating his work 
with trills, repeated figures and snappy glissandi. His unaccompanied 
introduction to "On Green Dolphin Street" was warm and supple, with only subtle 
hints of the beat-minded approach that was to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 The interplay between Mitchell and Bolivar shone on "My Funny Valentine," as 
the keyboardist dispersed punctuating chords behind the flutist's light-footed, 
dancing play. Mitchell's accompaniment thickened during more up-tempo numbers, 
being noticeably more dense during Bolivar's rousing alto sax improvisation on 
"(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An untitled blues found both Mitchell and Bolivar at their best. The 
keyboardist's work had an almost vocal quality as he sang, cried and shouted on 
the piano, often leaving long, considered pauses for dramatic effect. Bolivar, 
showing another side of his utility, took up the tenor sax in an R & B-drenched 
outing that took on the soul-baring honesty of a confession. If the two have 
any one genre in which they excel over all others, certainly it's the blues. 
</P>
<P>
 Tibbs and Brown filled in admirably, though only Brown added anything to the 
date as a soloist. Tibbs' improvisation from "On Green Dolphin Street" was a 
predictable exercise while his thumb-popping funk during "Freedom Jazz Dance" 
was of the "heard it too many times before" school. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, on the other hand, constructed an inspiring solo with his brushes 
during "Cherokee" while nailing down the funk on "Freedom Jazz Dance."

REALISM TAKES TOLL

<P>
 The wrestling onstage at "Turbo Tanzi" looks real, and it is, despite the 
choreography. 
</P>
<P>
 A bump is still a bump and a fall is still a fall, and the fighters earn the 
sweat that glistens from their bodies at the end of the show.One of those falls 
put Laurie Williams, who plays Tanzi, out of the play for four performances 
last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the big fight between Dean (the husband) and Tanzi," Williams, 27, 
said of the fall that put her temporarily out of commission. "It's my final 
victory move where I fly off his shoulder and I just landed wrong. But I went 
on to finish the show. It hurt much more the next day." 
</P>
<P>
 The first doctor she went to said her arm was fractured and put it in a 
temporary cast. The Oct. 29 show and the Oct. 30 matinee were canceled until 
the understudy could make it back to town for the Sunday and Tuesday evening 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Unhappy being out of the show, Williams went to a sports specialist, who 
judged it to be a sprain rather than a fracture. He taped it up, sent her for 
therapy, and the 5-foot-4, 110-pound Williams was back wrestling Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Since she's been back in the ring, however, she's torn some ligament in her 
knee, requiring more tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a fine line between a wrestler and a mummy," she said, ruefully.

 Campaigning the length of California, the four major candidates for U.S. 
Senate and governor readied their final pitches Sunday, the two Republicans 
appearing at an Orange County rally and all expressing a politician's 
confidence in their chances for election 48 hours hence. 
</P>
<P>
 Gubernatorial candidates Kathleen Brown and Pete Wilson continued their angry 
back-and-forth about illegal immigration, Proposition 187 and crime, issues 
that have dominated their campaign in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 While giving his standard endorsement of Proposition 187 before a rally of 500 
to 750 people in Costa Mesa -- amid chants from a small band of demonstrators 
nearby -- Wilson made a special appeal to Orange County Republican loyalists. 
</P>
<P>
 He urged Orange County voters to deliver a wide enough ratio to offset 
Democratic strongholds in other parts of the state, recognizing that 
Republicans for statewide office need 2-to-1 vote ratios in the county to 
maximize their chances of victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Work, my friends, work until the polls are closed to get every Orange County 
vote out," Wilson implored in a rally that included Senate candidate Rep. Mike 
Huffington and other GOP candidates for statewide office. "The last time there 
was a statewide election for this office, I counted on Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 As he did at an earlier campaign stop in Monrovia, Wilson told GOP volunteers 
that they should not be swayed by his lead in the polls but should work hard 
until election day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Run up the score," he told them. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was upbeat during a day of campaign stops. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should be dead. I oppose the death penalty. I'm Jerry Brown's sister. I am 
a woman. I'm running against an incumbent. I'm being outspent by 3 to 1, and I 
have (opposed) an initiative that was going to win by 66% of the vote up until 
two weeks ago and even now it's on the edge," Brown told reporters. "I should 
be dead. I don't feel dead for some reason. I feel really great, so we'll see." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate candidates Dianne Feinstein, the incumbent Democrat, and Huffington 
kept a somewhat slower pace but the heat of their rhetoric was nonetheless 
intense. Feinstein reminded voters of her work on the federal crime bill and 
the ban on military assault rifles; Huffington spoke in favor of the initiative 
on the California ballot that would imprison for 25 years to life those who 
commit three felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, in Monrovia, called Feinstein and U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer the 
"Thelma and Louise" of politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you remember what happened at the end of the movie," he said, alluding to 
the characters' demise off the end of a cliff. "We're going to send Dianne 
Feinstein home in two days to the city by the bay." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Feinstein was more confident than she has been in recent weeks 
and exhorted her followers to work hard through Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we let these races be bought, if we let these people who have huge amounts 
of money go on and run slanderous ads and you can't do anything about it . . . 
the American political process will be rent asunder," Feinstein said in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, whose campaign aides said they were convinced that the treasurer is 
making up ground, campaigned vigorously, her speeches firm and feisty despite a 
weekend spent explaining her campaign's financial troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 She made campaign stops in San Diego, Sacramento and in Los Angeles, where 
Brown spoke at a rally against Proposition 187, which would deny public 
education and non-emergency state services to illegal immigrants. She said the 
election presented a distinction between "politicians who use issues just to 
hold onto power and politicians who use power to address the issues of the 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown characterized Wilson as one who "would use our fears and our anger and 
our frustration just to hold onto power." 
</P>
<P>
 "It has happened before," she said to a standing ovation at the West Los 
Angeles United Methodist Church. "We must not let it happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to reporters later, Brown dismissed the open worries of many 
Democrats that her campaign's decision to air virtually no television 
advertisements on the final weekend before the election would be harmful to her 
and other party candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown aides said Saturday that they were unable to air ads this weekend 
because they had essentially run out of money last week. They still planned to 
run two anti-Wilson immigration ads beginning today. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said she had decided instead to put her campaign money into a field 
operation that could persuade voters to turn out on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she felt that her staff had mismanaged the finances -- as White House 
officials had grumbled Saturday during the President's visit to California -- 
she said, "I think you evaluate all of that afterward." 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown defended her campaign against accusations that it had violated the 
first rule of financing -- make sure there is money for the end of the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's also been a rule of politics for the last decade and a half that you 
don't put one dime into the field," she said. "It's a rule of politics that you 
spend it all on TV. I have not done that. I have been unconventional in a whole 
variety of ways in this campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson spent the day with other GOP candidates at a series of events that 
exuded Americana, from the huge American flag and Marine Corps hymn that 
greeted him in Riverside to the Little Leaguers with caramel popcorn and hot 
dogs in Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, security was increased -- a sign of the high emotions 
running through both sides of the Proposition 187 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 As Wilson pleaded with voters to pass Proposition 187, the voices of 
protesters could be heard from outside the fence of the Orange County 
Fairgrounds where the rally was held. Almost three dozen people, waving the 
flags of the United States and Mexico, chanted: "Children yes, Wilson no." 
</P>
<P>
 Accusing the federal government of not doing enough to help California with 
problems related to illegal immigration, Wilson told the cheering crowd: "We 
will take it into our own hands. We will fix it. We will vote yes on 187." 
</P>
<P>
 State Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, who shared the stage Sunday with Wilson, said 
after the Orange County rally that he had not yet decided how he would vote on 
Proposition 187, but that he would announce his position today, the day before 
the election. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief news conference after the Orange County event, Wilson continued his 
criticism of Clinton, who campaigned in California this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he had done his job, there would have been no need for 187," Wilson said. 
"I think, frankly, his performance in this state has been pathetic." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Monrovia rally in favor of the "three strikes" proposition, Wilson 
exhorted voters to pass that measure and dismissed suggestions that it might 
lock up felons who are not truly dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are incurable, incorrigible repeat offenders," Wilson said of the 
measure's targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein spent the final Sunday of her campaign at a union hall in San Luis 
Obispo and before supporters in Pasadena, where she talked about the ban she 
authored on military assault rifles. She said illegal immigration and campaign 
finance reform would be her top priorities if she wins a full term in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 With an eye toward the $28 million of his own money that Huffington has 
already spent on his own behalf, Feinstein said her reforms would include 
meaningful spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
 As she has many times before, Feinstein used the Pasadena event to tout her 
bipartisan support and was joined by the city's Republican vice mayor, Bill 
Paparian. He announced not only his support but Feinstein's endorsement by the 
Armenian National Committee, a politically conservative group that is 
supporting Wilson and carries some sway with the state's 500,000 Armenians. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, meanwhile, appeared at two events with Wilson and other GOP 
candidates. At one, the rally for the "three strikes" initiative, he brought up 
the recent deaths of two South Carolina boys, allegedly at the hands of their 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was disgusted," he said. "I cried. I was racked with pain. Our society is 
too lenient. We have too many liberals saying it's our fault, it's society's 
fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, it's not. It's the criminals' fault. Let's elect a senator to the United 
States Senate who is going to appoint the toughest judges available." 
</P>
<P>

writers Martinez in Orange County, Greg Krikorian with Feinstein, Amy Wallace 
with Brown and Dan Weintraub with Wilson and Huffington. Also contributing was

 TECH MECCA: If you're anyone who's anyone in the personal computer biz, you'll 
be at Comdex, the huge trade show Nov. 14-18 in Las Vegas. No surprise, then, 
that Orange County's major computer firms will be there. . . . Among them will 
be Touchstone Software Corp. of Huntington Beach, which will try to make 
ripples with its Superhuman Samurai Computer Safety Fun Kit. The $30 software 
package is based on a children's TV series. . . . The major selling point, 
according to C. Shannon Jenkins, Touchstone's president and CEO: Kids can learn 
about computer security and still have fun. 
</P>
<P>
 TELECOM: Seal Beach-based Rockwell International will be announcing advances 
in computer communication chips at Comdex. . . . One will help portable 
computers communicate via cellular phones and radio signals. Another will make 
speakerphones behave more like conventional telephones. "It will be more 
practical," says Tony Zuccarino, a Rockwell marketing manager. "People will be 
able to interrupt each other," which is not possible with most speakerphones. 
</P>
<P>
 EASY WRITER? A new ergonomic keyboard made by Genovation Inc. in Irvine is 
hinged in the center so it bends, allowing a custom fit for each hand and 
reducing wrist strain. "We think we've found the method that means you don't 
have to have your hands at any angle other than what's comfortable," says 
Leonard Genest, Genovation's president, above. . . . The Ergo Master keyboard 
has a suggested retail price of $395. 
</P>
<P>
 MEGAMAP: Thomas Bros. Maps of Irvine, publishers of the familiar road atlases, 
will be first-timers at Comdex to show off their electronic atlas, Geofinder 
for Windows. . . . The program will display every page of their regular 
guidebooks, plus lay out the fastest route to an address. . . . With additional 
hardware and a subscription fee, the program can be linked to Caltrans for 
reports on current road conditions. Glen Jansma, Thomas Bros. vice president of 
business development, says this would be especially valuable for those with 
portable computers and car telephones.

NEXT SCHOOLS CHIEF BRINGS UNIFYING SKILL TO SANTA ANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Toting the latest batch of student sketches to land in his lap, city schools 
superintendent Alfred Mijares zipped across town one day last week, anxious to 
squeeze his daily fix of classroom visits into a calendar stuffed with 
closed-door meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 He burst into Dory Lomas' classroom at Owens Elementary School, handing the 
colorful drawings back to a proud group of third- and fourth-grade artists who 
stood barely waist-high next to the 6-foot-2-inch superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 " Que bonito , this is very nice," Mijares told one girl, mixing the Spanish 
he spoke to his Mexican-born father with the English he learned in California's 
public schools. "No legs, hombre ," he playfully chided a young boy. "What 
happened to that?" 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-minute visit to Lomas' room, and another brief stop at a second-grade 
class, are part of a daily ritual for the head of the Bakersfield City School 
District, who was recently tapped to run Orange County's largest school 
district, Santa Ana Unified. 
</P>
<P>
 Dropping in at a different campus each day reminds him what the job is really 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm interested in those kids who are considered -- I hate to use the word 
'deprived' -- those students who don't seem to have all the opportunities," 
said Mijares, the child of migrant farm workers who will earn more than 
$100,000 in his new job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those students excite me more," he added. "There's something that moves me 
inside. Maybe I see myself in them. Maybe I just like the underdog." 
</P>
<P>
 At 41, Mijares has made a rapid climb up the administrative ladder, with 
virtually no experience as a classroom teacher. He began his career with a 
special education credential, became principal of a high school for expelled 
students and has presided over districts with high poverty rates. 
</P>
<P>
 As superintendent in Bakersfield, he runs a $105-million budget and serves 
26,500 students. When he takes over in Santa Ana, those numbers will double. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth of eight children born to parents who never finished high school, 
Mijares spent his early years shuttling around California's agricultural 
valleys, picking fruit with other migrant families. Later, his father scrambled 
to find gardening work and other odd jobs so the children could stay in one 
place long enough to get an education. 
</P>
<P>
 Mijares ultimately graduated from Simi Valley High School in 1971, then went 
to Cal State Northridge on a scholarship. Later, he earned a master's degree in 
social welfare from UC Berkeley, and a doctorate in social work at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father made it exceptionally clear that education was the key to success," 
Mijares said. "He used his own life as an example." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, those who have worked closely with Mijares praise his ability to set an 
example and serve as a role model for students and parents in the heavily 
Latino school districts he has led. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Parra, a school board member in Bakersfield, recalled asking students 
whether they knew Mijares. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reaction was, 'Dr. Mijares used to be a farm worker like we are, and now 
he is superintendent. And I want to be superintendent.' He made everybody feel 
good about themselves," Parra said. "He brought hope to this city, this 
district and this community. He will be missed." 
</P>
<P>
 Mijares began his first term as a school superintendent in 1990 in Coachella 
Valley Unified, near Indio, a sprawling rural district serving a new generation 
of migrant workers, with a student body that was 97% Latino. In 1993, he moved 
to Bakersfield, the state's largest elementary-only district, where 54% of the 
students are Latino, and Mijares was the first ethnic minority to serve as 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Unified's student body is 87% Latino. Nearly three-quarters of its 
48,286 students are learning English as their second language, and among the 
elementary students, 80% are poor enough to qualify for free or reduced-cost 
meal programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the district's demographics -- coupled with low standardized test 
scores and a high dropout rate -- frighten away many educators, they are the 
main reason Mijares chose to accept the new post. He succeeds Rudy Castruita, 
who left this summer to head the San Diego County Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the demographics," Mijares said. "If I am a scientist and somebody 
says to me, 'You have an opportunity to work in an experiment that could have a 
major impact on your field of study,' I want to look at it. I think (Santa Ana) 
will be an opportunity for me to lead and take risks." 
</P>
<P>
 The ambitious Mijares' tenure in most jobs has been better measured in months 
rather than years. While colleagues, employees and community leaders praise his 
integrity, communications skill and motivational leadership, he has left a few 
concrete accomplishments in educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Through writing and speaking at national education forums, Mijares has built a 
reputation as a deft financial manager and an ardent supporter of bilingual 
education. Closer to home, he earns credit for broadening parents' and 
employees' access to the decision-making process. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I think he is the best at is communication. I've seen him do that 
in a room with several thousand, and I've seen him do it with a parent in a 
hallway," said Bakersfield school board President Mike Maggard. "He can leave a 
room with some people holding their sides from laughing and others near tears 
because he touched them." 
</P>
<P>
 In Coachella Valley, Mijares began as assistant superintendent for instruction 
in 1989, and was swept into the top job a few months later, as the district 
confronted bankruptcy. Mijares slashed 20% of the budget and cut 186 jobs, then 
borrowed $7.3 million from the state, which stepped in to oversee the 
district's administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Since coming to Bakersfield in January, 1993, Mijares' main goals have been to 
build a districtwide vision of excellence and to decentralize district 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
 He has established superintendent "cabinets," modeled after the top 
policy-makers on presidential cabinets: one for teachers, another for 
classified employees, a third for parents and a special, "problem-solving" 
cabinet made up of school principals and district administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 When it came time to appoint new principals, Mijares asked school-based 
committees of employees and parents to screen candidates and establish 
priorities. And he has changed the decision-making process at the school board 
level to allow for more public discussion of controversial items. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's caring and concerned about the employees, but I can't say that he really 
has done anything programmatically different that's going to have a lasting 
effect on the district," said Pam Baugher, who heads the Bakersfield teachers' 
union and has worked in the district 26 years. "He started some things, but 
there's no closure to what he started." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana school board members said they are somewhat concerned about Mijares' 
short stays in previous jobs. They are hoping to get a three-year commitment 
from him when they finalize his contract Tuesday. But Mijares had a similar 
three-year contract in Bakersfield, and is leaving before the second year is 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 Mijares said he has no specific plans yet for the Santa Ana superintendency, a 
job he will likely start in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just going to get to know people," he said. "I want to get a feel for the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding his move to Santa Ana after close to two years in Bakersfield, he 
added: "I'm still in public schools. I'm still in the fray. I'm still meeting 
the same challenges. It doesn't matter whether my hat says 'Bakersfield' or 
'Santa Ana' or 'Coachella,' I'm still doing the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Among a dozen school board members and employees in his previous districts, 
Mijares is universally lauded as both a hard-worker and a devoted family man. 
</P>
<P>
 His days in Bakersfield often begin with 6:30 a.m. breakfast meetings (bran 
muffin and ice water for Mijares) at the local Marie Callender's. It is 
typically 12 hours later when he returns home to his wife and five sons, aged 
three to 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Raised Catholic but now regularly attending a nondenominational Christian 
church, Mijares names the Bible as his favorite book. His office is decorated 
with a USC Trojan clock and a collection of photographs of children at school 
and at play. 
</P>
<P>
 The desk is neat except for half-drunk Big Gulps of Diet Pepsi -- Mijares 
grabs a sip and a handful of M & Ms from the gum ball machine on a bookshelf 
before sitting down to start a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope I'm perceived as one who listens and one who cares and not one who is 
out to manipulate or exploit," Mijares said. "I am driven by a need to make an 
ethical decision, one that is right. I'm tired of the political and social 
expediency." 
</P>
<P>
 Maggard and others described Mijares as both a simple, down-home guy and an 
impressive intellectual. He punctuates conversation with the casual, "man," but 
often throws in a word that sends college graduates looking for a dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
 He struggles always to build consensus, which sometimes leads to slow, 
methodical decision-making, school board members in Bakersfield said. But this 
was a key quality that helped attract a unanimous vote to hire Mijares by the 
five Santa Ana Unified trustees, who have been bitterly divided over many 
issues during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was surprising is that we could differ so much philosophically on major 
issues and see the same qualities in a superintendent and agree that those 
qualities are what we wanted," said board member Audrey Yamagata-Noji. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it brought the board together," Trustee Rosemarie Avila said of the 
superintendent search process. "We just found (Mijares) to be very fair. He 
listens to everyone and he's very, very fair." 
</P>
<P>
 To Mijares, that impression is the highest compliment. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, what's most important is how you work with people," he said at the end 
of a two-hour interview in his office. "I just want people to feel that I was 
fair. And if I blew it, I come back and say, 'Doggone it, I'm sorry, I'll do 
better next time.' " Profile: Alfred Mijares

BOY, 15, DIES IN DRIVE-BY; 2 YOUTHS INJURED; CRIME: GUNFIRE FROM TWO CARS RAKES 
PEOPLE LEAVING A BIRTHDAY PARTY IN GARDEN GROVE. THE DEAD YOUTH WAS A HIGH 
SCHOOL SOPHOMORE THERE.

<P>
 A 15-year-old Garden Grove High School sophomore was killed and two other boys 
were wounded late Saturday when gunmen in two cars opened fire on a group of 
youths leaving a birthday party on a quiet residential street, police and 
witnesses said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy died of a gunshot wound to the chest several blocks away on Gary 
Street as his friends struggled to get him to a hospital, according to Sally 
Heraldez, 19. Heraldez lives at the house in the 11600 block of Faye Avenue 
where the attack occurred at 10:50 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 She and others at the scene identified the dead teen-ager as Cesar Torres of 
Garden Grove. Police refused to release the identity, saying they never 
disclose the name of a juvenile involved in a crime. The youth's family could 
not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a nice kid. He wasn't any gangbanger," a shaken Heraldez said Sunday 
as friends of Torres gathered on the blood-stained walkway near where he was 
shot. She said he was her sister's boyfriend and that he had been threatened by 
members of a Santa Ana gang for ignoring them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had told the gang members to leave him alone," Heraldez said. "So those 
other guys got offended and sent him a death threat." 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Scott Watson of the Garden Grove Police Department said it was unknown 
whether gang members had done the shooting but that "gang investigators are 
looking into the incident." 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor who said he witnessed the shooting, and asked not to be identified, 
had just gotten home when two cars rounded the corner of Patricia Drive on to 
Faye and someone in a back seat started firing a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 The cars did a U-turn in the street and came back and someone again opened 
fire at the group of youths standing in front of the home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened real quick," the witness said. "I saw two people get hit right 
off the bat. . . . Some people carried one of them inside and then they brought 
him back out again. . . . Another guy was hopping around, holding his leg." 
</P>
<P>
 The two wounded juveniles were taken by friends to Garden Grove Medical 
Clinic, Watson said. Both had gunshot wounds in the legs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents and schoolchildren from the nearly 40-year-old neighborhood 
gathered on Faye Avenue on Sunday, less than a block from Faylane Elementary 
School, and talked of how the incident shattered a typically quiet Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived here since 1957 and we've never had any problems," said Carl 
Fleck, 69, who lives across the street from where the shootings occurred. "We 
heard the shots and when I went out the front door a red car zipped up and I 
heard someone holler, 'Call an ambulance!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Fleck said the neighborhood was friendly and full of families and young 
children. Each year, most of the neighbors gather for a local Fourth of July 
parade, Fleck said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really haven't had a hint of problem here," Fleck said. "This is a quiet, 
peaceful place." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson said no suspects were in custody Sunday afternoon and that the 
investigation is continuing. 
</P>

THE KEEPERS OF THE NAME; LONGTIME ADMIRERS PAY RESPECTS TO RICHARD NIXON AS 
PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY DOCENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It took Woodward and Bernstein two books and more than 800 pages to sum up 
Watergate. After a special class this month, it takes Battersby and York just 
six words: A break-in. A cover-up. A resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Florence Battersby and Ed York, along with seven other eager students, learned 
this succinct version of history as part of the docent training course at the 
Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace. The orientation prepares these longtime 
admirers of the Yorba Linda native for duty as crowd handlers, watchdogs and 
tour guides at the presidential site. 
</P>
<P>
 With these docent newcomers, the library's volunteers will number an all-time 
high of 131. That's way up from the average of 80. Docent leaders attribute the 
latest membership surge to the former President's funeral in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw Richard Nixon's funeral on television, it tugged at my 
heartstrings," said Battersby, 69, echoing a sentiment common among the new 
crop of library volunteers. "I thought, 'Wouldn't it be wonderful to be part of 
that history?' " 
</P>
<P>
 But a mere whim will not transform a volunteer into a successful docent, whose 
ages range from 22 to 80, say trainers. It requires commitment, a good memory 
and the ability to stay on your feet for three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kind of people that volunteer here are high-powered," said Renee 
Wildenberg, 50, who has been a docent since 1990. "They have lots of energy and 
aren't the kind who sit around being couch potatoes." 
</P>
<P>
 As the students waded through streams of Nixon facts and protocol at a one-day 
seminar in mid-October, the library's basement took on the atmosphere of a 
demanding high school course. 
</P>
<P>
 First, there was the reading list -- close to 2,000 pages including the 
expansive presidential memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like 'War and Peace,' " remarked York, 64, a former engineer with 
the Department of Defense, referring to the 1,000-plus-page Nixon tome. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to read it in two days," joked Wildenberg, a Yorba Linda resident. 
</P>
<P>
 No laughing matter to the new docents, however, is that they will soon be 
expected to draw confidently upon facts culled from their readings and other 
library exhibits. For example, the new docents discovered they would have to 
know tidbits such as the births, marriages and deaths of four generations of 
Nixons and Milhouses; that the library's moon rock is as big as the one in the 
Smithsonian Institution; and that Ed Cox proposed to Tricia Nixon in the White 
House's Lincoln Sitting Room. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's mind-boggling to get all this under your belt," said Carolyn Nollette, 
59, of Yorba Linda, who like other beginners received five follow-up training 
sessions with veteran docents before going solo in the library. "There's just 
so much history." 
</P>
<P>
 Next came the rules. Lots of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't refer to the Nixons as "Dick" or "Pat," even if you knew them. Don't 
chew gum on duty. Don't bother VIPs. Don't be a piece of furniture, but don't 
be the main attraction either. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, beware the press, trainers told the group. It's something Nixon might 
have said himself. Docents were instructed to defer media questions to library 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Be aware you may be talking to the press or someone who would like to spread 
a negative opinion using the Docent Guild as a source," advises the docent 
manual. 
</P>
<P>
 And always abide by the dress code. The guild's 26 men and 105 women have 
little trouble deciding what to wear to their three-hour shifts at the library. 
While on duty, the men must wear gray slacks, white shirt, a navy blue jacket 
and a Nixon Library Docent Guild tie. 
</P>
<P>
 The women must stick to white blouses, navy blue skirts, red jackets, and the 
Nixon Library Docent Guild scarf. Because they have more fashion choices, the 
women have more restrictions than the men. They are also directed to don only 
natural or navy blue nylons, select conservative hair bows, use modest amounts 
of perfume and wear "plain" earrings. 
</P>
<P>
 Straying from the Docent Uniform Standards, which were adopted in September, 
could land volunteers in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ladies, if you wear one earring that plays the 'Battle Hymn of the Republic' 
and the other one plays 'America the Beautiful,' you're going to hear from me," 
charter docent Jo Lyons told the trainees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like an awful lot of dos and don't's," added Wildenberg. "But they 
are important and a wonderful set of information to refer to." 
</P>
<P>
 The list grew long this summer. Docents, who already shared fondness for 
volunteerism and the Nixon family, apparently were getting too chummy during 
their shifts. The chattiness prompted a new rule: no socializing on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got to the point where people were left to their own devices and own good 
common sense," said Lyons, a Yorba Linda resident, who has volunteered at the 
library since it opened in July, 1990. "And it just didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 The docents take all this to heart and pay for the privilege. There is a $50 
training fee and annual dues of $25. The Nixon memoir, a fact book and other 
goods, including the official docent tie or scarf, are included in their docent 
package. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the daylong training session turns to the delicate matter of dealing 
with contentious visitors, who want to argue about Watergate and other 
controversial events of Nixon's long and tumultuous political career. The 
three-sentence synopsis and the library's Watergate display should speak for 
itself, explained the docent trainers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Occasionally, you'll get a guest that will want to challenge you about your 
opinions," said Wildenberg. "It's just human nature. But don't get in an 
argument with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We present the facts, you draw your own conclusions," she added. "Other than 
that, there's not a lot to comment on." 
</P>
<P>
 The library's assistant director, Kevin Cartwright, defended their take on the 
political saga that led to the downfall of the 37th President. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our exhibits are no more skewed than others," Cartwright assured the trainees 
during an early morning tour. "Watergate's a very complicated story to tell." 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to explain how all Presidents since FDR had some type of taping 
mechanism in the White House," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The new docents got the message. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've made up my mind, if anybody says anything that's OK," said Battersby. 
"You don't have to like him (Nixon)." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't argue with them," she added. "I wouldn't want to be rude. I would 
turn and walk away before that." 
</P>
<P>
 That type of non-confrontational attitude would have sat well with the former 
President, say veteran docents, who credit Nixon with paving the way for peace 
in Vietnam and the Middle East, detente with the Soviet Union and reaching out 
to China. While addressing the volunteer group a few years ago, Nixon said he 
wanted visitors to feel at home in his birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 And as Wildenberg put it: "We want them to leave the library with a warm, 
fuzzy feeling. We are not only dispensers of information, but also dispensers 
of warmth and comfort as well."

DEVELOPERS WARY OF PLAN TO BUY WATER DISTRICT; UTILITY: A DECISION ON FIRM'S 
UNUSUAL OFFER FOR SANTA MARGARITA SYSTEM IS EXPECTED EARLY NEXT YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three powerful South County developers are lobbying against an unusual bid by 
a private firm to buy the Santa Margarita Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent letters to state and county officials, Coto de Caza Ltd., the Santa 
Margarita Co. and the Mission Viejo Co. said residents would be better served 
and would enjoy cheaper water rates in the long run if the district remained 
publicly run. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on our analysis, we see no reason to support or go forward with this 
venture," said Brian H. Gentner, senior counsel for Coto de Caza Ltd.  
</P>
<P>
 Last May, California-American Water Co. of Chula Vista, a subsidiary of 
American Water Works Co., the largest privately owned water company in the 
country, surprised the district board and the California water industry with 
its offer to buy the district by taking over its $300-million debt. 
</P>
<P>
 But by using a state law, California-American was able to circumvent any 
consideration of its proposal by the district's board, which opposes it. 
Instead, the company successfully circulated a petition among residents, 
forcing the county's Local Agency Formation Commission to consider its 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision is expected in early 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Private water and sewer systems exist around the state, including many owned 
by California-American, but this would be the first purchase by a private 
company of a public district. 
</P>
<P>
 The 100-square-mile district serves 80,000 residents in Mission Viejo and 
Rancho Santa Margarita, parts of San Juan Capistrano and San Clemente, and the 
40,000-acre Rancho Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo Co. spokeswoman Wendy Wetzel Harder said her company needs a lot 
more information before it can back California-American's proposal. The Mission 
Viejo Co., which has been building up its community since 1963, believes the 
district is worth much more than the $300 million of debt, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like making payments on your house for 25 years and then someone 
coming along and offering to pay if off in bonds. But then you don't own it 
anymore," Wetzel Harder said. "We can't support this at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 John Schatz, general manager of the district, admits he was surprised to find 
allies in the developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the district has financed itself to the hilt to construct the water 
and sewer infrastructure to serve its future growth of 180,000 residents, the 
developers in the area now must pay about $5 million annually to keep the water 
and sewer rates low enough to sell homes, Schatz said.  
</P>
<P>
 "When this first happened, we thought the landowners were behind it," Schatz 
said. "In this district, developers have historically subsidized the water and 
sewer rates to make the homes more attractive to sales." 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Jones Jr., president of California-American, said although the company 
would have welcomed the developers' support, it makes little difference. The 
company can simply do a better job because of economies of scale and the 
success its parent has had nationally, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are confident that the people would be better served under a regulated 
private utility," Jones said, adding that the company has a successful record 
all over California, including communities in San Diego and Los Angeles 
counties and the Monterey Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Schatz, however, said that a public agency has tax and financing advantages, 
which a private company that must earn a profit cannot match. None of 
California-American's other service areas are anywhere near as large as the 
Santa Margarita district. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Trager, an Irvine attorney who specializes in water issues, called the 
company's bid "an opportunist action" meant to take advantage of the 
scandal-plagued district's problems. Three of the district's top managers were 
fined during the past year after pleading guilty to criminal 
conflict-of-interest charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is something very skewed about this concept. A private company should 
not be allowed to buy government," Trager said. "That's like Philip Morris 
walking into the North Carolina Legislature and saying, 'Give me the keys to 
the Statehouse.' That's not how we do things in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 But Don Owen, a longtime director of the Orange County Water District, said 
the success or failure of such a purchase depends only on how efficiently the 
district is run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's workable," said Owen, who has a unique perspective because he is 
a director of the privately owned Dominguez Water Corp. in Los Angeles County. 
"I think there are enough checks and balances to make it work either way. It 
really comes down to who can be the most efficient and most imaginative in 
making the systems work."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BUENA PARK; CITY AGREES TO $245,000 IN PROJECTS

 They went through a firestorm of criticism last spring when they agreed to 
close the Fire Department, but City Council members were able to enjoy the 
rewards of that decision last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The financially strapped council finally had money to spend on capital 
projects, and the first thing members agreed on was the need for 15 left-turn 
signals throughout the city.Drivers also will benefit from improvements to 
bone-jarring railroad crossings and other funds will be spent to update the 
city's emergency preparedness plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, each council member had submitted a "wish list" of one-time 
projects totaling about $400,000 -- half the proceeds of selling off fire 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining funds will be held in reserve to cover any increase in the costs 
of belonging to the Joint Powers Authority, which will provide firefighting 
service to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Installing the left-turn signals, at a cost of about $100,000, was the only 
priority on every council member's wish list, Finance Director Greg Beaubien 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kevin O'Rourke pleaded for $25,000 to upgrade the disaster 
preparedness plan. Smoothing over the railroad crossings on Artesia Boulevard 
will cost about $120,000. The council will decide how to spend the remaining 
$155,000 at a study session. LESLEY WRIGHT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAKE FOREST; TENANTS TO BUY MOBILE HOME PARK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Escrow is scheduled to close on the Kimberly Gardens Mobile Home Estates this 
week and when it does, residents will let out a collective sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 Life has been tense for the past two years, as the mobile home tenants have 
struggled with their landlord and the City Council to stabilize rents. 
</P>
<P>
 With senior citizens on fixed incomes comprising almost half of the park's 
population, rent control has been an emotional issue at the Muirlands Boulevard 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 But with federal housing officials and the park leaseholder helping out, 
Kimberly Gardens residents have found a way to finance a $6-million takeover of 
the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels fantastic," said Jim Froelich, who heads the tenants group. "We can 
now control our own destiny and maintain an affordable lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is important because so many of us are on fixed incomes. When rent 
increases exceed increases in Social Security, they go in the hole and it 
becomes a matter of 'Do I buy medicine this week or pay for rent?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberly Gardens was one of four mobile home parks in the city that for more 
than two years has struggled to get a rent control law passed. Rent control 
failed to become a reality by one slim vote on the City Council, but Kimberly 
Gardens tenants continued to push for autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 They canvassed the governmental map, asking city, county, state and federal 
authorities for assistance in financing a loan to purchase the 30-year lease on 
their property. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, federal Housing and Urban Development authorities agreed to help them 
come up with 30% of the $6 million purchase. The leaseholder agreed to carry 
the rest of the loan and the 159-space park will belong to its former tenants 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents are still talking with county and city officials about helping 
defray the cost of the loan, but Froelich said it won't keep the land deal from 
coming through. FRANK MESSINA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTWIDE; ACTIVIST SEEKS SUPPORT TO REINSTATE RIDES

<P>
 Sallie McMillan has lived for 82 years without being moved to get into 
politics, but now she is so angry she has started a one-woman campaign to 
reinstate the countywide Dial-a-Ride program. 
</P>
<P>
 McMillan, who suffers chronic pain from back and hip injuries, has hauled her 
wheelchair and walker to malls and grocery stores to collect signatures for a 
petition to Gov. Pete Wilson to get the Dial-a-Ride buses moving again. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cancellation of this service has placed many senior citizens in 
jeopardy," her petition reads. About 300 residents have signed it and she said 
she plans to carry the fight to Congress and even the President. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the Orange County Transportation Authority phased out the 
Dial-a-Ride program, which provided same-day van service to seniors and the 
disabled, for budgetary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The county was mandated to provide transportation for the disabled and it 
began a shuttle service called ACCESS, but able-bodied senior citizens are not 
eligible to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who do qualify are not happy with ACCESS, McMillan said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, ACCESS charges $1.50 -- soon to be $1.70 -- for a one-way ride 
compared to the 90 cents Dial-a-Ride charged. Reservations to go each way must 
be made 48 hours in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Several times she was told that ACCESS could not accommodate her, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 ACCESS has about 200 buses and provides 1,000 scheduled trips per day on 
weekdays, said John Standiford, a spokesman for OCTA. Some problems are due to 
software glitches and OCTA hopes to cut down the lead time for reservations 
shortly, he said. LESLEY WRIGHT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; UCI GETS A NUMBER BEFITTING ITS NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of waiting and considerable debate, UC Irvine telephones began 
ringing to a new prefix this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone numbers on the UCI campus beginning with the 725 and 856 prefixes 
were switched Saturday to 824. Not coincidentally, the digits spell out UCI on 
telephone key pads. 
</P>
<P>
 Several UCI academic departments already put in dibs to get customized 
numbers, including an ophthalmology clinic (UCI-2020), fine arts tickets 
(UCI-ARTS), billing services (UCI-BILL) and the bookstore (UCI-BOOK). The final 
four digits of most old telephone numbers on campus will remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone service officials at UCI requested the prefix switch about four 
years ago but discovered that the city of Colton had already taken 824. The 
prefix became available when parts of Los Angeles County and the Inland Empire 
switched to the 909 area code in November, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting the new prefix cost UCI $36,000, said David L. Tomcheck, director of 
electronic communication services. It cost an additional $8,000 to refer all 
the old main telephone numbers, such the chancellor's, the political science 
department's and the registrar office's, to the new ones. Callers to the old 
main numbers will get recordings stating the new numbers; callers to individual 
people on campus will get a recording simply saying the number has been 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Since officials announced the change early this year, some budget-conscious 
members of the UCI community have complained that the telephone number change 
was an unnecessary expense.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are anxious about the change, but a number of campuses across 
the country have gone through it," said Don McLaughlin, assistant director of 
electronic communications services. "UCI is not doing it because it spelled 
UCI, we're doing it because of growth" expected on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin said the university had about 6,000 possible telephone numbers with 
its 856 and 725 numbers and would have had to get a third prefix within three 
to five years to accommodate new people and offices on campus. With the switch, 
UCI will have about 10,000 possible numbers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI officials added that telephone numbers for student and faculty housing 
will remain unchanged.ALICIA DI RADO

<P>
 The county Planning Commission has come up with a third option for the 
development of the Bolsa Chica Wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest option includes a tidal inlet and allows 100 additional homes, 
according to Ron Tippets, county chief of coastal planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners sought another plan because public comments persuaded them that 
one more option should be considered, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The third option also includes reducing the acreage of a community park in the 
lowlands and allowing a kayak and canoe facility, Tippets said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the facility would allow limited excursions into the wetlands 
for scientific and educational purposes and would be controlled by county park 
rangers and the state Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 Public comments on the third option will be accepted during the next six 
weeks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Osugi, city associate planner, said the comment period should be 
extended. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time "we turn in comments at the end of the six-week period, based on 
the county's schedule, the county Planning Commission hearings (which conclude 
on Nov. 30) will (have been) completed already. The comments won't get the 
level of review by the Planning Commission as the first set of comments did," 
Osugi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koll Real Estate Group proposes to build 4,286 homes, but the county has 
presented options for either 3,200 homes or 2,500 homes. Under the third county 
option, up to 3,300 homes may be built, Tippets said. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll's plan also includes a $20-million tidal inlet to link the wetlands and 
the ocean, and restoration of 1,100 acres of wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Nelson, Amigos de Bolsa Chica president, said: "Without the tidal inlet 
alternative, you're not providing the best alternative for the highest quality 
restoration." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon LaBedz, a spokesman for Surfrider Foundation, which opposes a tidal 
inlet, said: "In our view, this is a $20-million boondoggle that will flood the 
wetlands and pollute the ocean. . . . It has the potential to erode the beach 
and cliffs." DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; CONCEPTUAL APPROVAL GIVEN PLAZA PACIFICA

<P>
 Plaza Pacifica, a 600,000-square-foot commercial center that will be the 
city's largest retail project, won conceptual approval last week from the 
Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, to be located near the corner of Avenida Pico and La Pata Avenue 
in the Rancho San Clemente area, will include a theater complex, a plaza area 
framed by a food court, and a multitude of retail shops and anchor stores with 
a Spanish architectural theme. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 to 200 homes to be built on a slight grade above the retail center 
also are part of the design approved by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 James S. Holloway, the city's community development director, said the project 
will fill a need for commercial space in the city.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have long known that there is a tremendous retail sales tax leakage in the 
community," Holloway said. "We did a market analysis and identified the need 
for 1.2 million to 1.5 million square feet of regional commercial shopping 
space to take care of the community's needs for the next 15 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Plaza Pacifica would be the largest commercial center in the city, about three 
times bigger than Ocean View Plaza adjacent to Avenida Pico near the Interstate 
5 freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Before any groundbreaking can occur, the project must be approved in concept 
by the City Council, and then more detailed drawings must go through the public 
hearing process before the commission and council, Holloway said.LEN HALL

 The City Council has decided to spend $1,000 to install 20 markers on the Salt 
Creek Trail. 
</P>
<P>
 The redwood posts will be topped with boxes containing brochures detailing the 
history of the 20 view points along the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Natural History Museum will create and refill the natural 
history guides, which will also describe the plants and animals that populate 
the trail area.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; BUILDERS PICK WOODBRIDGE FOR AWARD

<P>
 The Urban Land Institute has named the city's Woodbridge Village the nation's 
best large-scale residential development, nearly 20 years after construction of 
the 1,750-acre community began. 
</P>
<P>
 The Urban Land Institute, an international organization of building industry 
professionals, based the Award of Excellence on design, land use and community 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Four out of the city's five council members live in the 27,000-resident 
community, including Mayor Michael Ward, president of the Woodbridge Village 
Assn. from 1989 to 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a one-of-a-kind development," Ward said. "You'll never see another one 
like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge Village residents often refer to their community as the "city 
within the city," Ward said. More than 20% of the city's residents live in 
Woodbridge. The community's two lakes are stocked with large-mouth bass and 
catfish for fishing and residents also take to the water in canoes and paddle 
boats. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodbridge Village Assn. has created an array of recreational programs for 
residents of the community's 9,292 homes and apartments. It was the first 
village planned by the Irvine Co. entirely under city jurisdiction and includes 
200 acres of open space. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel Woodbridge is among the very best communities in America, not only 
because of the quality of the master plan, but also because of the people who 
have made it a great community," said Keith Greer, president of Irvine 
Community Builders, an Irvine Co. division. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge home sales began in 1976 with the nation's largest new home sales 
lottery. There were 7,000 families who vied for one of the 240 available homes 
in a single weekend. Residential development was completed in 1987. RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; PARKED MOTOR HOMES BANNED ON LILAC AVE. 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite one resident's complaint that he would have no place to park his motor 
home, the City Council last week adopted an ordinance that bans parking of 
oversize vehicles on Lilac Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The council gave final approval Tuesday to the ordinance, which will go into 
effect Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance prohibits vehicles longer than 18 feet or wider than 8 feet from 
parking on Lilac between Richardson Street and Harbor Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance was prompted by concerns that non-residents have been parking 
motor homes and campers overnight on Lilac Avenue and creating safety hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ronald King, a resident of the area, told the council that the parking ban 
would create a hardship for him and suggested permit parking for people who 
live in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents spoke in favor of the ordinance, however, saying that it will 
help solve problems on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Delores Stidham, whose home faces Lilac Avenue, said she is tired of looking 
at a motor home with a flat tire parked in front of her house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just upsets me to think this man lives there," she said. "I don't want to 
see this anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Raymond, president of the Harbor Valley Homeowners' Assn., agreed that 
the neighborhood has become unsafe and the campers are an eyesore. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law, Raymond said, "will go a long way to clean up the area." DEBRA

<P>
 The Anaheim City School District has approved a 3% raise for 710 employees, a 
move that will cost the district $1.6 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Trustees approved a two-year contract with the Anaheim Elementary 
Educators Assn. that will raise teachers' salaries to between $29,410 and 
$56,172 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Three percent raises, retroactive to July 1, were also granted for 
administrative employees, including the superintendent and three assistant 
superintendents. 
</P>
<P>
 The salary increase is the second in as many years. Last year, the district 
approved a 1% increase for all employees.  
</P>
<P>
 The district will now begin negotiations with classified employees. DANIELLE

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: A HOMEY SETTING FOR HOMELESS TO GET HELP; IN PLACENTIA, 
WHEN YOU HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO, YOU GO TO H.I.S. HOUSE.

<P>
 The 29-bed shelter opened four years ago by the Placentia Presbyterian Church 
has helped 63 otherwise homeless families get on their feet. Tenants stay 60 to 
90 days and are screened for their commitment to find jobs and save enough 
money to get back into traditional housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from institutional, H.I.S. (Homeless Intervention and Shelter) House is 
homey, with a fireplace and typical family furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember the first time I sat here, I said, 'It's been almost a year since 
I sat on a sofa,' " said one former resident, who asked that her name not be 
used.  
</P>
<P>
 H.I.S. house offered her son, now 21 months old, his first chance to play on a 
lawn. It offered her a chance to find an apartment. She is going back to school 
to train for a job to replace the one she lost because of a disability. 
</P>
<P>
 H.I.S. House residents have individual bedrooms, and the rest of the house is 
communal. Residents take part in weekly "life skills" classes and learn to 
interact with the world in a new way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I want to cry when I think of what I lost. But then I think of what 
I gained," the former resident said. "I learned to deal with people of all 
kinds of backgrounds. I learned to accept the situation. I learned no matter 
what, to not cry and keep going because it's transitory." HOLLY J. WAGNER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; MORATORIUM ON NEW BUSINESSES EXTENDED

<TEXT>
<P>
 While the city completes a parking study, the City Council has extended an 
ordinance banning the opening of new churches, businesses and other facilities 
that require extensive parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members voted 4 to 0 last week to extend the moratorium until August 
while a consultant reviews the city's parking standards and suggests 
changes.The temporary ban was enacted in September and due to expire last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the ordinance, no permits will be granted to churches, gas stations, 
assembly halls, dance studios, professional offices or trade schools. The 
temporary ban includes restaurants with a license from the state Department of 
Alcoholic Beverage Control to sell liquor and wine and restaurants that provide 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Exempted are family-oriented small restaurants that do not require extensive 
parking, according to J. David Kennon, director of development services. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennon said the moratorium will give the city time to complete a parking 
study, adopt changes in city codes and enact a new ordinance setting guidelines 
for land uses, including churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the city awarded a $15,000 contract to O'Rourke Engineering of 
Santa Ana to conduct the study, which is expected to be completed this month. A 
proposed parking ordinance could go before the council in February, Kennon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance prohibits issuing new building permits for construction, 
additions or improvements to existing buildings. Exempted are requests for 
extension or renewal of conditional-use permits, site plans and building 
permits which were approved before the temporary ban was enacted. BERT ELJERA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; MUSIC CONSERVATORY STILL A TRAVELING SHOW 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Irvine Music Conservatory teachers are still driving to their students' homes 
three months after they were barred from holding classes at the school's new 
location. And the 20-year-old nonprofit organization is still paying $1,650 a 
month to rent space in a building it cannot use. 
</P>
<P>
 After the music school moved to its new, larger quarters at the Airport 
Business Center on July 30, city officials prohibited music classes there, 
citing zoning and fire code restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 The school has lost about 35 students since it moved and survives only by 
sending teachers to the homes of about 80 students, according to the 
conservatory's director, Eric Wright. He blames Koll Management Services, the 
leasing and management division of the Koll Co., for recommending the site, and 
says leasing agents have been slow in helping the school find a new location. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to get the ball rolling and get back in business," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Koll attorney Ron Brown said the music school failed to secure necessary 
city permits when a smaller facility became available last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been right on top of it. We showed them space immediately," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll has offered the school a larger location nearby, but it would cost more 
-- about $2,000 a month. Wright said the school cannot afford that price and 
plans to make a counterproposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. blamed Koll leasing agents for not 
checking with the city to determine if music classes could be taught at the 
current site. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company takes a different view. "In essence, it was up to the tenant 
to make sure their use was compatible with zoning and everything else," Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright said the school cannot continue to pay monthly rent for space it cannot 
use. "We're giving it one last gasp," he said. RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; PANEL TO BACK HIKE IN TRAFFIC-IMPACT FEE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An ad hoc committee tonight will recommend to the City Council that it raise 
the traffic impact fee by $49 to $277. 
</P>
<P>
 All new businesses and developments in the city would have to pay the fee, 
with the revenue going to improve streets affected by the additional traffic 
generated by those projects.If approved by the City Council, it would raise $20 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad hoc city committee reviewing the issue is made up of a former city 
traffic commissioner, small and large developers, homeowners, a planning 
commissioner and a Chamber of Commerce official. They will make their 
recommendation at the council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council, however, will not vote on the fee increase until the 
beginning of next year, Mayor Sandra L. Genis said.  
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, the committee is just telling the staff to go forward with the 
paperwork," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Genis said some particulars of the fee still have to be ironed out, including 
how much new fast-food restaurants will have to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is also expected to adopt a resolution allowing the city seal to 
be used only for official city business. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue came to light last month after Councilman Peter F. Buffa, who is 
seeking reelection, used the city seal on fund-raising invitations he mailed to 
residents in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also plans to approve $10,200 to install fencing that will serve 
as a backstop for two new youth baseball fields at TeWinkle Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 The project also includes irrigation and turf improvements for existing soccer 
and baseball fields. TOM RAGAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; UCI WINS GRANT FOR STUDY OF DEMOCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scholars at UC Irvine have won a five-year, $562,500 grant from the National 
Science Foundation to study the creation and growth of democracies, university 
officials announced last week.  
</P>
<P>
 Through the Graduate Research Traineeship Program on Democratization and 
Democratic Politics, educators will develop studies on democracy around the 
world, UCI spokesman Scott Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant also will subsidize five doctoral students with full-time 
fellowships each year, beginning next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see this as putting the political science department finally on the map," 
said political science professor Russell Dalton, one of the project's chief 
investigators.  
</P>
<P>
 The grant is a victory for social science researchers at UCI, where the 
heftiest chunks of grant money usually go to biological and health sciences or 
related fields. It means the amount given in fellowships through political 
science will quintuple, Dalton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant also will help create a new generation of experts in democracy by 
funding the work of doctoral students in the area, Dalton said. "Good 
(graduate) students are the best investment -- they'll teach sections and grade 
papers for the other students as well, and assist faculty in research." 
</P>
<P>
 UCI professors and scholars formed a focused research program on 
democratization in 1991. About 25 UCI democracy scholars cooperate with about a 
dozen teachers at other UC campuses and 10 participatory politics experts from 
Germany, Japan and other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Democratization has quickly become one of the most central questions in 
political science and social science," since the Berlin Wall came down and 
democracies sprung up worldwide in 1989, Dalton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers in the program are studying new democracies in Eastern Europe and 
elsewhere, Dalton said, and how democratic processes expand in the West.  
</P>
<P>
 The program explores how people construct electoral systems, write 
constitutions and develop tolerance and democratic values. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalton's fellow researchers on the project are professor emeritus Harry 
Eckstein, Prof. Rein Taagepera and Assistant Prof. Jozsef Borocz.  
</P>
<P>
 Students will also work with Prof. Bernard Grofman, who has researched 
elections in South Africa and minority voter representation through 
redistricting in this country. ALICIA DI RADO

FULLERTON MAN DEAD AFTER CRASH; 2ND MAN INJURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 20-year-old Fullerton man died after a car went out of control and crashed 
into a pole near the intersection of Beach Boulevard and Lampson Avenue in 
Stanton, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 A second man in the car was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Jae Kim was pronounced dead at UCI Medical Center in Orange after the crash at 
10:45 p.m. Saturday, said Brian Mitchell, a spokesman for the Orange County 
coroner's office. The other man, who was not identified, was also taken to the 
medical center. 
</P>
<P>
 The two victims were traveling south on Beach Boulevard when their 1993 Honda 
left the road and struck a telephone pole, Sheriff's Department Lt. Bill 
Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not clear which man was driving, Leonard said. The crash left both 
pinned inside the car. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no indication if alcohol was involved or if they were wearing seat 
belts or why the car went out of control," Leonard said. The investigation is 
continuing, he said.

'RUN FOR COVER' RACES RAISE ABOUT $75,000 FOR THE COUNTY'S HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 2,300 walkers and runners made their way Sunday around Fashion Island in 
the "Run for Cover" races, sponsored by HomeAid and the Hard Rock Cafe to help 
the homeless of Orange County.  
</P>
<P>
 Race organizers said the event raised about $75,000 for HomeAid, a 5-year-old 
nonprofit charity sponsored by Orange County builders.The event included three 
races: a 10K run, a 5K walk-run and a 1K run for children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had about $30,000 in corporate sponsorships and about $45,000 in entry 
fees," said Mike Schlesinger of Costa Mesa, the co-chairman of the event and an 
executive of Pacific Point Partners, a development company. "This event grows 
every year. Last year we had 1,800 runners and we had 500 more this year." 
</P>
<P>
 The money will support Home-Aid's various activities. Home-Aid, made up mostly 
of contractors and executives from the Building Industry Assn. of Orange 
County, has assisted more than 1,500 people in Orange County and just completed 
its 19th project in which it adopts and renovates existing homeless shelter 
programs, Schlesinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great marriage between the nonprofit care providers and the for-profit 
developers," Schlesinger said. "It maximizes the strength of both parties." 
</P>
<P>
 HomeAid will conduct its Project Playhouse on Saturday, an event where 
builders construct children's playhouses and raffle them off, during Homeless 
Awareness Week, which is Saturday through Nov. 19.

6 VIETNAMESE AMERICANS GIVEN LIFE-ACHIEVEMENT AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six prominent Vietnamese Americans from Orange and Los Angeles counties were 
given lifetime achievement awards here Sunday for creative work they began at 
least two decades ago in Vietnam and pursue today in their adopted homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 A writer, journalist, sculptor, actress and two musicians received the awards 
from the Committee of Vietnamese Overseas Artists, a nonprofit group 
headquartered in Little Saigon. Organizers hope the awards will become an 
annual event. 
</P>
<P>
 Since arriving in America after the 1975 fall of Saigon, Vietnamese refugees 
have achieved success in literature and the fine and performing arts, said 
actress and award-winner Kieu Chinh, who appeared in Oliver Stone's movie "The 
Joy Luck Club." 
</P>
<P>
 "With 20 years of rise and fall," the L.A.-based actress said in a speech 
opening the awards ceremony, "with many deceased and many alive, with a 
generation passing and another coming, Vietnamese literature and arts have 
become a . . . string knotting all Vietnamese generations together around the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Also receiving awards were Viet Hung, an Anaheim musician who performs 
traditional Vietnamese music; Nguyen Thanh Thu, a Garden Grove sculptor; and 
Nguyen Viet Khanh, a journalist who works for Santa Ana's Viet Bao Kinh Te 
newspaper. Other L.A.-based winners were Vo Phien, a novelist and short-story 
writer; and Le Trong Nguyen, a musician and composer. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnamese artists performed at the awards event, dubbed Artists Reunion Day 
and held at the First Presbyterian Church of Orange County. About 1,000 people 
from as far away as Australia attended the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Many such cultural performances are planned for "Project 20," a yearlong 
commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the first Vietnam War refugees' 
arrival in the United States, running this Thanksgiving through next. 
Organizers of the project include members of the Garden Grove-based Vietnamese 
American Arts and Letters Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County is home to about 100,000 Vietnamese, who make up the country's 
largest Vietnamese community, most living in Westminster, Garden Grove and 
Fountain Valley.

HUNTINGTON COUNCIL EXPECTED TO ACT ON SPORTS COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council is expected today to consider designating a site for a 
50-acre, $20-million youth sports facility within an undeveloped area of 
Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-phase development is proposed on the east side of Golden West Street 
between Ellis Avenue and the Central Library parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Beauregard president of Save Our Kids, views the proposal as "the last 
bastion of hope." 
</P>
<P>
 "Families are using sports as a positive outlet for kids," said Beauregard. 
"And, there's been no additional facilities for kids for years." 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard and city officials say the need is overwhelming to provide sports 
facilities, and that the council's action would be the first step to achieve 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer, swimming and roller hockey are growing in popularity, Beauregard said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always favored many more sports fields," said City Councilwoman Grace 
Winchell. "The city has done the best they could with cooperating with the 
schools in jointly maintaining and providing sports fields. "Upfront, I'd like 
to get fields on the line so we can (accommodate) organized sports." 
</P>
<P>
 Community Services Director Ron Hagan said the park is the only city-owned 
site available for the proposed facility.  
</P>
<P>
 The first phase, a 15-acre area, estimated to cost between $4 million and $5 
million, includes athletic fields for baseball, soccer and football, Hagan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagan said the city will apply for grant money and work with youth sports 
groups to raise money to build the fields. 
</P>
<P>
 The second phase is a 15-acre area for practice fields that could be used for 
special events and overflow parking. A gymnasium, aquatic complex, community 
center with senior services and a hard-surface parking lot is proposed for the 
final phase, Hagan said.

POLICE ARREST MAN IN YOUTH'S SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Garden Grove man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder early Sunday 
after allegedly shooting a juvenile in the chest during a fight in Buena 
Clinton, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Norberto Leon, 23, was arrested at his apartment, at 13412 Clinton St., 
shortly after the 12:30 p.m. shooting, said Sgt. Scott Watson of the Garden 
Grove Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson said Leon pulled out a handgun and shot the boy, who lives in Garden 
Grove, in the midst of a fight among three or four people in a carport in the 
12700 block of Keel Avenue. The boy was shot once in the chest and was taken to 
UCI Medical Center in Orange, where he was listed in stable condition, Watson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was not identified because of his age. Watson said the shooting was 
not considered to be gang related.

SHAW DENIES REPORT RAMS ARE SET TO MOVE; FOOTBALL: TEAM PRESIDENT SAYS NO FINAL 
DECISION HAS BEEN MADE. ST. LOUIS, BALTIMORE OFFICIALS TO COME TO L.A. THIS 
WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ram President John Shaw, who will meet with Baltimore and St. Louis officials 
this week in Los Angeles, dismissed a report Sunday night that had the team 
ready to make application to move to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be several weeks before we get in position to make a final decision," 
Shaw said. "We have absolutely made no decision to move. There are still 
several open points with St. Louis, and it's my understanding they will be 
coming here Thursday or Friday to discuss them." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Buck, a St. Louis-based and nationally known broadcaster, caused a stir 
with a report Sunday that the Rams' advisory board is in the process of making 
a recommendation that the team move to St. Louis. Buck attributed the report to 
an unnamed source. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea what he's talking about," Shaw said. "Georgia Frontiere will 
make the final decision and I am in the process of gathering information to 
properly advise her." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw indicated the Ram advisory board, which is composed of business leaders 
and celebrities, will have no say in the team's decision to stay or leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see where someone might become confused. Our lawyers are in the process 
of putting together a statement of reasons on why we would move, if that's 
ownership's decision. It's something preliminary, and something we have been 
doing in both St. Louis and Baltimore. We have said all along we will make 
application to the league if the decision is to move, and this work is 
necessary to comply with league requirements." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said Peter Angelos, majority owner of the Baltimore Orioles, canceled a 
Friday meeting in Los Angeles, but will be here Wednesday. The election of a 
new governor in Maryland could impact the decision to provide a new rent-free 
stadium for the Rams.

RAMS 27, DENVER BRONCOS 21; RAMS REWRITE ELWAY'S STORY LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ram cornerback Wymon Henderson didn't think his former teammate, Denver 
quarterback John Elway, was picking on him in the final minutes Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 But it sure looked that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Who could blame Elway for going right at Henderson on third- and fourth-down 
plays in the final two minutes of the Rams' 27-21 victory Sunday at Anaheim 
Stadium? Just look at what they brought to the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway, the comeback quarterback, orchestrator of The Drive against Cleveland 
in the 1988 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson, cut by the Broncos last year, had the task of covering Pro Bowl 
tight end Shannon Sharpe. So was Wymon asking himself: Why me? 
</P>
<P>
 "Sharpe is a go-to guy all year for them, and they didn't do anything any 
different," Henderson said. "I don't think they were trying to pick on me like 
that in any way." 
</P>
<P>
 They were, but it didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson stopped Sharpe for a two-yard gain on third and eight, and was in on 
the fourth-down throw that Sharpe thought he caught, but was ruled a drop and 
trapped ball by the officials. A catch would have given the Broncos a first 
down at the Ram 38. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Lord just willed it that it was an incomplete pass," Henderson said. 
"That's just the way it went. I just thank God it was incomplete." 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson sought divine intervention, but Sharpe thought he had a catch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was good," Sharpe said. "The official was on top of the play, so 
he had the position to make a good call. He probably did, but I didn't feel the 
ball hit the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Ram free safety Anthony Newman said Henderson made a "great play" on Sharpe's 
third-down catch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sweating bullets but I knew we would come through," Newman said. "They 
had scored twice on us and we said, 'Enough is enough. We're putting a stop to 
it.' 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to be in that situation because we knew Elway was the best. If we 
can stop him, we can stop anybody. We did that, and we grew up a little today 
and we're winning the games we have to win. That's what I'm always talking 
about -- this team needs to grow up." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what he was thinking when he saw Elway trot on the field with about two 
minutes left, Ram wide receiver Flipper Anderson smiled and said: "You're not 
going to do it today, Johnny. Not the way our defense was playing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams entered the fourth quarter with a 24-6 lead and nearly left with a 
one-point loss. Elway began picking them apart on 82- and 80-yard drives. He 
found Glyn Milburn, who beat Henderson on the left side, for a 20-yard 
touchdown with 13:56 left, and then drilled a 12-yard pass between Newman and 
strong safety Marquez Pope for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were upset when they scored that second touchdown," Pope said. "But the 
veterans on the team were like, 'Look, we're still winning. We shouldn't be 
arguing or upset.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Pope thought it would have been a heck of a defensive effort to waste. The 
Rams' pass rush forced Elway out of the pocket several times in the first half, 
and Jimmie Jones sacked him once in the second half for a five-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway completed 24 of 45 passes for 241 yards and two touchdowns, but the Rams 
held him to 40 yards passing in the first half as they built a 17-3 halftime 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-3 lead -- the same halftime advantage the Rams blew four weeks ago at 
Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "No visions of Green Bay today," cornerback Todd Lyght said. "I don't remember 
Green Bay or what they look like. We just want to win, and now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to do our thing and we'll win some ball games in the second 
half. If the offense plays the rest of the season the way they played today, 
there's no telling, we might go 7-1." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the Rams have to settle for 4-5. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Newman points out, they are 2-0 against two of the best quarterbacks 
in the game -- Elway and Kansas City's Joe Montana. Six weeks ago, the defense 
shut out Montana for the first time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what our defense is all about," Newman said. "We like to be out there 
in the mix and take care of business."

RAMS 27, DENVER BRONCOS 21; BRONCOS BACKTRACKING ON MARCH TO PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A one word answer seemed to say all Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 John Elway, last week it looked like you had some questions answered. Things 
were starting to take shape. Everything was moving in the right direction. And 
now you're right back where it was a few weeks ago.  
</P>
<P>
 "Correct." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysis had never been so simple and so painful for Elway. 
</P>
<P>
 He and the Denver Broncos were ready to shout.  
</P>
<P>
 They watched the Rams hold on for a 27-21 victory and saw their playoff surge 
stopped, maybe for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed this game to really say, 'We're back,' " tight end Shannon Sharpe 
said. "Instead, we're asking ourselves again, 'What happened? What's wrong?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Questions that seem too familiar. The answers aren't there and time is growing 
short. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the talent we have, had someone told me we would miss the playoffs, 
I wouldn't have believed them," Sharpe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos, who lost their first four games, had put themselves in the 
position for a playoff run. They had won three of four games, including 
consecutive victories over San Diego and Cleveland -- both division leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 They were 3-5 with three consecutive home games ahead. The makings of a sweet 
picture provided, of course, they beat the Rams, a 3-5 team treading water. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Broncos went down, possibly for the last time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't lose anymore games," Elway said. "If we can get on a roll, we can 
make it." 
</P>
<P>
 They better hurry, moss is starting to accumulate. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway threw for 201 yards and two touchdowns in the second half, but he 
couldn't put together one of his typical fourth-quarter miracles. 
</P>
<P>
 The last gasp came with two minutes left. But Sharpe's fourth-down catch was 
ruled incomplete over the protests of Coach Wade Phillips. Still, the game was 
lost long before that controversial call, according to the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think every individual has to take it upon themselves to be ready for a 
ball game," safety Steve Atwater said. "That wasn't the case. I don't who it 
was, I just know they weren't ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos were down, 14-0, seconds into the second quarter. They went three 
plays and punted on their first possession. They got one first down on the 
second time they had the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 By halftime, the Broncos had all of 60 yards by halftime and trailed, 17-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always going to bite you in the end if you don't play 60 minutes," 
running back Glyn Milburn said. 
</P>
<P>
 They put in about 30, although the first few of the second half were more of 
the sleep-walking-variety. The Rams scored on their first possession to take a 
24-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos didn't make any easier on themselves. They had 93 yards in 
penalties. They were offside on kickoffs not once, but twice. The second hurt 
and led to more mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway's 20-yard touchdown pass to Milburn and a two-point conversion by Sharpe 
pulled the Broncos to within, 24-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Kinchen was then stopped on the Ram five on the kickoff. But the Bronco's 
Richard Harvey was ruled to have been offsides. The re-kick gave the Rams the 
ball on the 33. 
</P>
<P>
 They drove for a field goal, aided by two pass interference calls on defensive 
back Randy Hilliard, one of which nullified his interception. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had two offsides on kickoffs," Phillips said. "I can't imagine those 
things happening. It was those kind of things that kept us from winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sharpe: "Seems like instead of finding a way to win, we find a way to 
lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Not a good sign for a team and a quarterback known for fantastic finishes. But 
the Broncos have lost eight games by three points the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think John has spoiled us," Sharpe said. "He gives us the feeling we can 
dig ourselves a hole and he'll dig us out. We just can't do that anymore. We 
have to play complete games. We were like two entirely different teams today."

 Frustrated with his role in the offense, tight end Troy Drayton sounded off on 
the Rams' coaching staff Sunday for their play-calling on three downs from the 
Denver one-yard line in their 27-21 victory over the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 Drayton was upset the Rams didn't run a pass play and instead ran tailback 
Jerome Bettis three consecutive times in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Drayton threw his helmet and was visibly upset after Bettis failed to score on 
third down and the field goal unit came on to the field. Tony Zendejas' 18-yard 
kick gave the Rams a 27-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in the stadium knew Jerome was going to get it," Drayton said. "I 
wanted them to throw the ball because Denver was blitzing and they stacked so 
many men around the ball and they weren't concerned with the pass." 
</P>
<P>
 Drayton, who has caught a team-high four touchdown passes this season, has 
complained the past two seasons about not having a bigger role in the game 
plan. He caught three passes for 37 yards Sunday, including a 20-yarder from 
Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
 Considered one of the team's best receivers, Drayton is often taken off the 
field on passing downs so the Rams can use four wide receivers in their shotgun 
formation. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job isn't just to be a pain in the butt to the coaching staff," Drayton 
said. "In the heat of battle, I want the ball in my hands . . . There's just 
not enough balls to go around. There's nothing I can do about that, it's up to 
the coaching staff." 
</P>

 Quarterback controversy? What quarterback controversy? Chandler is 2-1 as the 
Rams' starting quarterback in place of Chris Miller, and Chandler hinted after 
Sunday's game that he might have the job for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I played really well," Chandler said. "I went out and did my deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to play. I hope to play. That's (Coach Chuck) Knox's call, but I feel 
really good about the way I played." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller has been the team's starting quarterback most of the season, but 
Chandler's name appears on the NFL's Pro Bowl ballot that was distributed to 
fans at Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Rams' public relations staff, the team submitted Chandler's 
name, not Miller's, after Chandler started against Kansas City and led the Rams 
to a 16-0 victory. Miller started three of the next four games before a 
concussion sidelined him in the second half of the New Orleans game.

BEAUREGARD'S JUST ONE OF THE BOYS IN POOL; WATER POLO: MARINA SOPHOMORE IS 
AMONG INCREASING NUMBER OF GIRLS IN SPORT NOW PLAYING ON BOYS' TEAMS. 
</P>

 Unlike one of her predecessors, Robin Beauregard hasn't been punched in the 
face simply because she is female. Nowadays, the slights against girls who play 
high school water polo are more subtle. 
</P>
<P>
 "One guy was nice enough," Beauregard said, "to tell me that he would hit me, 
even if no one else on his team would. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, they just grab your suit to get by you, and my suit happens to be a 
little longer than most." 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard, a Marina sophomore, is one of a growing wave of girls playing high 
school water polo. She is one of a few starters; another, Amanda Gall, is a 
senior at Empire League champion El Dorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of rising demand, many local schools have established girls' teams, 
but they are not a priority. Often games are nothing more than exhibitions 
played before the officials arrive for the freshman-sophomore game. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, girls who have the ability and inclination to play the sport at a 
higher level, must tread water with the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard, for one, does just fine. Despite being a sophomore, she is 
Marina's primary two-meter defender, the most demanding defensive position in 
water polo. And Marina is not a weak team. The Vikings (16-11) are ranked No. 6 
in the Southern Section Division II, they finished second to Esperanza in the 
Sunset League and will find out today who they will draw in the first round of 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Water polo is a rough sport, with most of the contact under the water, out of 
view of spectators and referees. And Chuck Beauregard, Robin's father, said at 
first he was a little worried about having his daughter mixing it up with the 
boys.  
</P>
<P>
 But Robin Beauregard has been playing the sport since she was 9, with the 
Golden West swim club -- with boys and girls -- so playing at Marina seemed 
natural. Besides, she had wanted to play since her brother, Michael, a Marina 
captain in 1992, played for the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year as a freshman, she split time as goalkeeper on the varsity and as a 
full-time field player on the freshman-sophomore team. She made quite an impact 
-- she was named the Sunset League's most valuable freshman -- boy or girl. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, three players expected to be on the team were unable to play, so 
Beauregard was one of several who were asked to step up. Beauregard is the only 
sophomore starter, but that has caused no resentment, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys treat her probably a little bit different, but they respect her as 
an athlete," Wright said. "She's a girl, but she can definitely hold her own." 
</P>
<P>
 Support from teammates wasn't something Sandy Vessey could count on when she 
played goalkeeper for Marina's varsity in 1980 and '81. First, her mother had 
to petition the school board for her right to play, then some never fully 
accepted her as part of the team. Vessey persevered, despite once suffering a 
punch in the face by an opponent, and twice was a second-team all-league 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Since married, Vessey Schneider played eight years for the U.S. national 
women's team and now is in her first year coaching water polo and swimming at 
Santa Ana Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
 Times have changed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see my boys' attitude toward girls who they play against," Vessey Schneider 
said, "and none have ever taken the attitude that 'She's just a girl and what 
is she doing out here?' 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the comments I heard all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Vessey Schneider, who has known Beauregard since she coached Michael as a 
freshman at Marina, has high expectations for the sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 Vessey Schneider was among the coaches at a development camp for girls 17 and 
younger last summer in Colorado Springs, Colo., where Beauregard, 15, made 
quite an impression. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the coaches got together and ranked the 60 girls, she was No. 1," Vessey 
Schneider said, adding that Beauregard could be one of the next great players 
for the U.S. women's national team. 
</P>
<P>
 "She just needs more years of experience playing with older girls and a few 
more years playing with the guys," Vessey Schneider said. "She's got the 
strength, the speed, the size and the smarts." 
</P>
<P>
 At 5 feet 9, 150 pounds, Beauregard is about average size for Marina, but 
she's no weak link: she can bench press her weight. She's an A student and uses 
her knowledge of the game to even the score against bigger, stronger opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, sometimes opponents don't guard her as closely as her male teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Underestimate Beauregard at your own risk -- she played shortstop and third 
base in Little League and she's got a live arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the time it is a lot of fun," Beauregard said. "Especially, if you 
score. Then you get to see the look on their face or the guy guarding you yell 
at the goalie because he says the shot should have been blocked."

GIRLS' OPTIONS REMAIN LIMITED

 The idea of women's water polo in the United States is gaining ground, 
although opportunities are still limited. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA recognizes women's water polo as an "emerging sport" even though few 
schools have teams above the club level.San Diego State and some schools in the 
Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference have varsity women's 
programs and Stanford and California are planning to add teams soon. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hit and miss on the high school level. All but one Sunset League school 
has a girls' team, but most schools have only a handful of players if any. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless we make it an official (Southern Section) sport, the girls aren't 
going to come out," said Mike Stachowski, who helps coach the Santa Margarita 
girls' team. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Southern Section to sanction championships, about 100 of the 491 
schools would have to have teams. Bill Clark, assistant commissioner, said the 
section plans to survey its members in the next month to determine 
participation levels and interest in girls' water polo. MARTIN BECK
