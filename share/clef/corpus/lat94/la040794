GUN OWNERSHIP AND MURDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to your editorial, "Gunning Down a Civilization," March 29: 
</P>
<P>
 I was also sickened by the murder of the Japanese students, but I was also 
sickened by The Times' editorial calling for more senseless gun laws. The 
entire editorial criticized gun ownership, yet spent no time criticizing the 
criminal who committed the murder or calling for the capital punishment that 
murderers deserve. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times stated that "respect for life crosses cultures and oceans -- or at 
least it should." The one thing that The Times needs to understand is that most 
of our nation's firearm-related crime is concentrated in urban areas where 
there is a large and distinct gang and criminal culture that has little regard 
for life. That is where The Times needs to focus its energies. The true problem 
lies with the criminals who could murder two people for a short ride in a car 
and think nothing of it. Until these individuals who culturally have no respect 
for life are permanently removed from our society the situation will not 
change. I will always respect firearms as tools to protect the lives and 
freedom of people that I care for, because I realize that there will always be 
people who have no respect for life and freedom.

 The highlight of a recent trip to Washington was discovering what Thomas 
Jefferson had written about the Constitution he helped draft. There it was on 
the walls of the Jefferson Memorial and, among other things, should give pause 
to the gun lobby and the lawmakers who support them. He wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not an advocate for frequent changes in law and constitutions but laws 
and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As 
that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new 
truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the change of 
circumstances, institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times. We 
might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy 
as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous 
ancestors."

CAN NATO BE DECISIVE AGAIN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the 4th Century BC, the political orator Demosthenes, speaking at a time of 
peril in the life of Athens, told his fellow citizens that they were like a 
clumsy boxer always moving his fists to shield the last place struck. In 
addressing the Bosnian crisis, Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, could use a lesson from Demosthenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace became imaginable in Bosnia for the first time when NATO, implementing a 
longstanding U.N. resolution, delivered an ultimatum to the Serbs about their 
Sarajevo artillery. In plain English, it was "Move it or lose it." The Serbs 
moved it. 
</P>
<P>
 Optimists then proposed that similar ultimatums be issued elsewhere in Bosnia. 
Pessimists predicted that the Serbs would move their firepower to other Muslim 
or Croat targets. What immediately followed was neither. It was an unexpected 
reconciliation between Bosnia's Muslims and its Croats and a new peace 
momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the last few weeks, however, the predictions of the post-Sarajevo 
pessimists have come to pass: savage ethnic cleansing of Muslims in Banja Luka 
and a Serb siege of the Muslim enclaves of Maglaj and Gorazde. The slaughter 
now taking place in Gorazde is comparable to the slaughter that prompted 
decisive action at Sarajevo. Can NATO be decisive again? 
</P>
<P>
 Shalikashvili says no. NATO air strikes, he says, could be effective against 
Serbian artillery at Sarajevo but would not be against the infantry doing the 
killing in Gorazde. But must NATO be Demosthenes' boxer? Must Gorazde's defense 
come at Gorazde? 
</P>
<P>
 We think not. We urge the Clinton Administration to call on NATO to deliver to 
the Serbs the kind of Gorazde ultimatum that could stop the siege overnight: 
Lift the siege or prepare for air attack. Where? On what? That should be for 
NATO to know and the Serbs to find out. Serb military assets are many. NATO 
knows where they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Shalikashvili claims that this course would make NATO a belligerent on one 
side in a conflict in which it must maintain neutrality. This is nonsense. NATO 
is not neutral. If it were, the Sarajevo ultimatum could never have come about. 
The "evenhanded" neutralization of the virtually nonexistent Bosnian artillery 
along with the potent Serbian artillery at Sarajevo was a transparent charade. 
</P>
<P>
 For the rest of its self-defense, Bosnia does not need U.S. ground troops. It 
needs a U.S. President who will take seriously the Senate's 87-9 approval in 
February of a non-binding resolution calling for a unilateral U.S. lifting of 
the arms embargo against Bosnia. Ideally, a NATO Gorazde ultimatum would come 
in tandem with a lifting of the embargo by all the NATO members. Failing that, 
the Clinton Administration should offer its NATO allies a choice: Either issue 
a Gorazde ultimatum (an existing U.N. resolution is all the authorization 
needed) or plan on a unilateral U.S. lifting of the Bosnian embargo -- and 
therewith, sadly, a tacit loss of U.S. confidence in NATO itself.

SOUTH AFRICAN ZULUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Having just returned from South Africa where I met so many fine Zulu people, 
I took offense to Anthony Hazlitt Heard's accusation of Zulus going "on the 
rampage laying into civilians" (Commentary, March 30).  
</P>
<P>
 Following the aforementioned quote, Heard admitted that the Zulus were fired 
upon from high-rise buildings.Hey, I'd run too if snipers were firing at me. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Heard evoked the name of God in his next untruth wherein he accused the 
Zulu demonstrators of attempting to "storm the ANC headquarters." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Heard has been away from South Africa too long not to know that 10,000 
Zulus could have easily stormed the ANC headquarters had they wanted to -- 
snipers or no snipers. I believe it is to the Zulus' credit that they did not 
storm the building even after being fired upon.

COCKBURN ON MALTHUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I can just hear the fax machines ringing as neo-Malthusians in the 
environmental movement scramble to justify themselves ("Bringing Malthus Up to 
Date," Column Left, March 29). Alexander Cockburn actually scores more hits 
than misses in demonstrating that individual reproductive responsibility, as 
important as it is to our species' survival, is integrally connected to 
societal responsibility for equitable economic structures and ethical social 
relations. Those who decry the "population explosion," but fail to be at least 
as alarmed about the underlying "injustice explosion" that detonated when 
Eurocentrism began to dominate the planet, are perpetuating the notion that 
privileged people urge universal contraceptive access to protect their own 
advantages, rather than to work toward a sustainable future for all. 
</P>
<P>
 As the world's attention is drawn to these complex issues at the U.N. 
International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo this September, 
religious groups across the country are helping to redefine the population 
growth dilemma as more of a symptom than a cause of poverty. One of the most 
effective ways to begin the healing is to support the global "50 Years Is 
Enough" campaign in its efforts to reform the manifestly unfair economic and 
environmental practices of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.

 * Cockburn shows how the far left can be at odds with the goals of mainstream 
liberalism. Cockburn is proud of disconcerting the Population Committee of the 
Sierra Club in California by discounting the menace of overpopulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cockburn goes on to speak approvingly of single teen-agers who intentionally 
choose to bear children. He wants society to have to support its "surplus 
poor." I do, too, but within rational limits. Does Cockburn see no boundary to 
the drain on our finite resources by a potentially unlimited number of people 
clamoring for services? Are those of us who are particularly concerned about 
the delivery of contraceptive services to teen-agers all to be classified as 
racists? Does Cockburn really think it is beneficial to society for 
14-year-olds to bear large numbers of children at public expense? 
</P>
<P>
 Before Cockburn so self-righteously rejects concerns about overpopulation, he 
should look at the squalor and human degradation of places like Calcutta, 
India.

 * Obsession -- a fixation that clouds the mind and makes rational discourse 
almost impossible. Lest anyone question whether or not Cockburn has a virulent 
obsession with Jews and Israel, they need only read "Bringing Malthus Up to 
Date." In a column which otherwise focuses on the philosophy of the 19th 
Century economist, Cockburn's first two paragraphs gratuitously deal with the 
controversy between Louis Farrakhan and American Jews. "The whole uproar is 
fraudulent," Cockburn writes, "rearing a vast mountain out of a tiny molehill; 
just another way of hyping Israeli bond drives." 
</P>
<P>
 Excuse me? Cockburn has never missed an opportunity to attack Israel, but this 
latest effort is truly bizarre. How in the world is the Jewish community's 
anger over the anti-Semitic and racist sentiments of Farrakhan pertinent in a 
column focusing on capitalism, welfare reform and the poor? Cockburn's 
obsession is becoming, in the words of Lewis Carroll, "curiouser and 
curiouser."

GEORGE STEPHANOPOLOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "Not Wrong, Just Overtaken by Other Facts," Column Left, 
March 31: 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Kinsley reports that George Stephanopolous found when he called his 
pal at the Treasury Department that he was breaking the rules when he 
complained about lawyer Jay Stephens' appointment to investigate the failure of 
Whitewater-connected Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. 
</P>
<P>
 This phone call could be written off as part of the learning curve for a new 
politician in Washington were it not for two facts: (1) Stephens is a 
Republican who is known to oppose some of the actions taken by the Clinton 
Administration, and (2) at President Clinton's right hand is 
Stephanopolous.Stephanopolous' phone call suggests that an attempt was made 
from a power base to upset the appointment and interfere with an RTC 
investigation. Since Stephanopolous admits the purpose of the phone call, his 
action has the appearance of an abuse of power flagrantly displayed for purpose 
evident. Recall that abuse of power was the criminal action that influenced 
then-President Nixon to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinsley's comment about the Wall Street Journal editorials and Rep. Jim 
Leach's (R-Iowa) honesty and record in Congress warrants response at a date now 
uncertain when more dust (or spray) has settled.

WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * A letter from Michael Markarian (March 28) claims that America's wildlife is 
only managed for the benefit of the 7% of the population that hunts. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Wildlife Management Institute in Washington, licensed hunters 
provided $422 million in state funds for licenses, stamps and fees just for the 
1990-91 hunting season.Taxes imposed by hunters on hunting-related equipment 
produced more than $160 million in 1991. Many other funding programs developed 
by hunters exist to benefit wildlife. Some of these programs date back to the 
mid-19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, many conservation groups such as Ducks Unlimited provide more 
funding and volunteer hours to keep animal populations healthy for future 
generations of hikers, photographers and, yes, hunters. 
</P>
<P>
 However, out of the 1,150 species of animals in North America that benefit 
from these programs, only 145 (12.5%) are legally hunted. This hunting is 
strictly regulated by the state and is usually only attempted by hardy 
individuals who thereby gain a true appreciation of nature's balance.

COUNCILMAN DOESN'T LIKE THE QUESTIONS; THE ETHICS COMMISSION ISN'T SUPPOSED TO 
BECOME WARM AND FUZZY WITH CITY HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The audit staff of the city's Ethics Commission has reviewed Councilman Hal 
Bernson's campaign expenditures and committees and found too much disarray to 
extend the good bookkeeping seal of approval. 
</P>
<P>
 In a highly critical audit released Monday, the staff said that Bernson had 
used campaign funds for more than $158,000 in questionable expenditures, 
including foreign travel and expensive dinners. It could not find documents to 
verify how an additional $700,000 in campaign funds was spent by two of seven 
campaign committees controlled by Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson's response: "They (the staff) have been biased, hostile and 
antagonistic because I won't knuckle under to (Benjamin) Bycel (executive 
director of the Ethics Commission) and his dictatorial tactics." 
</P>
<P>
 We can do without the bluff and bluster. City law requires routine audits of 
candidates' finance committees, and the Ethics Commission brings a welcome set 
of eagle eyes to the task. Besides, Angelenos did not vote to create the Ethics 
Commission to have it be warm and fuzzy with City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings of this latest audit covered some ground previously explored by a 
state attorney general's probe that cleared Bernson of using campaign funds for 
personal benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time for the facts to come out, and the staff was right to send its audit 
on to the Ethics Commission's enforcement staff, the city attorney's office and 
the state Fair Political Practices Commission -- the agencies that enforce city 
and state campaign finance reform laws. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Bernson's second run-in with the Ethics Commission. Last November he 
was one of two local politicians who initially refused to comply with an Ethics 
Commission order to give the city treasury a sum equal to campaign 
contributions that turned out to be tainted; in Bernson's case, $10,000 was 
involved. The councilman was among 20 state and local candidates who 
unwittingly received laundered money. The Ethics Commission emphasized that 
none of the 20 had known that the contributions were improper. Only in January 
did Bernson agree to pay up. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Bernson and his staff are complaining that the ethics staff did not grant 
them enough time to respond to the audit. In fact, they had 45 days; that's 15 
days more than usual. We would suggest that more precise bookkeeping in the 
first place might have left Bernson and company with much less to explain. The 
councilman and his staff should complete their studies and present their 
explanations. The public deserves answers.

HERE'S WHY STRAWBERRY'S PROBLEM IS A DISEASE, TOM; HOW ANYBODY COULD BE DUMB 
ENOUGH OR WEAK ENOUGH TO TAKE (DRUGS) IS SOMETHING I CANNOT COMPREHEND. I MEAN, 
IT'S CRAZY. . . . THIS IS NOT A DISEASE, LIKE LEUKEMIA OR CANCER. IT'S A 
WEAKNESS -TOMMY LASORDA ON TUESDAY,ON DARRYL STRAWBERRY'S DRUG ABUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVEN R. BELLOWS, Keven R. Bellows, a public-relations executive in Los 
Angeles, formerly headed the Alcoholism Council of Greater New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shame on Tommy. If alcohol and drug addiction is a weakness, Lasorda is the 
epitome of wisdom and decorum. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely, he knows better. As a life-long professional in a field littered with 
careers splintered by drug and alcohol abuse, the Dodger manager has 
consistently been exposed to the facts of addictive disease and is far more 
knowledgeable about it than the average person. 
</P>
<P>
 His anger at Darryl Strawberry's relapse and his apparent feelings of betrayal 
are understandable. But the irresponsibility of his public comments is not. As 
a highly visible leader in the megaworld of professional athletics, Lasorda 
should limit his ex cathedra pronouncements to baseball and leave the 
definition of alcohol and drug addiction to the medical experts. 
</P>
<P>
 That drug/alcohol addiction is a disease is unquestioned in the field of 
medicine. The American Medical Assn. so classified it many years ago, and 
addiction treatment and therapy is a well-accepted medical specialty. In 
addition, genetic and neurological research have proved that certain types of 
alcoholism are inherited.  
</P>
<P>
 The sad facts, however, are these: The disease has a painfully high relapse 
rate; most people who have it die from it, and there is no cure, only 
remission. If Lasorda is frustrated by this reality, imagine how Strawberry and 
his family feel. 
</P>
<P>
 Why didn't Lasorda just come out and say what is probably true -- that 
Strawberry broke his heart? Alcoholics and addicts hold the world's record for 
breaking hearts -- but not out of immorality, lack of character or stupidity. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Will an active addict deny that he is using? Answer: Is the Pope 
Catholic? The symptom of denial is commonplace.  
</P>
<P>
 It's simply untrue that Dodger leaders couldn't directly confront Strawberry 
with their suspicions that he had relapsed. Based on their comments in the 
press, they had documented proof of unprofessional conduct, with unacceptable 
excuses. Given that, and Strawberry's acknowledgment of his disease and prior 
treatment, the Dodgers were well within their legal rights to take more 
aggressive steps. Indeed, it could be argued that the facts required them to 
intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 Interventions are an accepted and effective process for confronting the sick 
person, most often involving family members, close colleagues from work and a 
good friend or two. The goal of an intervention is to block all the 
psychological exits, leaving the addict with no excuses or viable 
rationalizations for his behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The critical success factor is consensus on the consequences of refusing 
treatment and the commitment of all involved to follow through on them. While 
interventions often fail, most successful ones have a consequence that is 
work-related. Experience teaches that the typical alcoholic / addict in the 
throes of disease may well choose the loss of family over the loss of alcohol 
and drugs, but far fewer choose their drug of choice over their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sobriety is a life-long challenge met one day at a time. Darryl Strawberry has 
an extremely hard road ahead, made immeasurably more difficult by his celebrity 
and visibility.  
</P>
<P>
 There are lots of us out here, trudging that same hard road. Hang in there, 
Darryl.

 When Michael Fay, an 18-year-old American, was sentenced to a "caning" for 
vandalism in Singapore, the initial reaction in this country was one of 
outrage; even President Clinton criticized the sentence as excessive and 
reportedly is seeking to have it withdrawn. But almost immediately, there was a 
backlash of Americans asking: If severe corporal punishment helps to maintain 
public order in Singapore, would it not be good policy here? 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think so, although I am sometimes angry enough at criminals to be 
tempted to advocate it. 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore canings are brutal. A martial artist strikes the offender's bare 
buttocks (in Fay's case, six lashes) with a half-inch rattan cane moistened to 
break the skin and inflict severe pain. The loss of blood is considerable and 
often results in shock. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporal punishment is not necessary to achieve public order, even in 
Singapore. Other countries do not employ corporal punishment, yet their streets 
are relatively free of random violence. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also principled reasons for opposing corporal punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 From antiquity to the present, law scholars have generally agreed that to be 
just, the punishment should be proportionate in severity to the crime. Under 
this principle of "just deserts," murderers may be executed, but not speeders. 
How many of us would consider the brutal flogging of a teen-ager as a just 
desert for vandalizing property? 
</P>
<P>
 Fay's caning seems like excessive punishment to me. The Singapore authorities 
do not disagree. The caning may be overly harsh, they acknowledge, but it will, 
they say, deter other youths tempted to commit crimes against property. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence for this assumption is sparse and unclear. In 1960, a British 
Home Office research group (the Cadogan Committee) undertook a study of 3,000 
cases of violent robbery, virtually the only offense where corporal punishment 
was still being imposed in Britain. The researchers found that robbers who were 
flogged were slightly more likely to be again convicted of robbery with 
violence than those who were not flogged. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the study is inconclusive. The difference between the two groups was not 
statistically significant. Besides, those who were flogged might have repeated 
their offenses not because they were flogged, but because the authorities 
lashed only those who were perceived to be the most violent and most likely to 
repeat their crimes.  
</P>
<P>
 It could also be argued by advocates of corporal punishment that the most 
violent robbers weren't walloped harshly enough. After all, they weren't caned 
on the buttocks by a martial arts expert whose thrashing could send them into 
shock. Corporal punishment, the advocates would contend, is a deterrent only if 
it is adequately severe. 
</P>
<P>
 That brings us to this question: Assuming that our Constitution was amended to 
allow corporal punishment, were we to start down that road, how would we know 
where to stop? Historically, corporal punishment has included burning, 
branding, blinding, mutilation and amputation. In some countries, people 
sentenced to death were drawn and quartered, that is, partly strangled and, 
while still alive, disemboweled and torn apart. If we abandon the just-desert 
principle, how far down the road of pain does the quest for deterrence carry 
us? 
</P>
<P>
 And if we permit corporal punishment to be judicially determined, how will we 
control its administration in our correctional institutions? Once the corporal 
punishment barriers are down, won't we be inviting prison guard and police 
brutality? 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor to consider: Our prisons are disproportionately occupied by 
members of minority groups. In 1991, the United States had the highest 
incarceration rate in the world, 426 per 100,000. Predictably, those who will 
be beaten and branded and mutilated in this new American justice system will be 
disproportionately young, male and black and possibly Latino. Aren't racial 
tensions in this country high enough as it is?  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, corporal punishment advocates might argue that beating and mutilation 
are cheaper than imprisonment. Not necessarily. It would depend on whether 
caning is the sole mandated punishment or an add-on. Note that Michael Fay was 
fined and sentenced to four months of jail time in addition to the caning. 
</P>
<P>
 The same offenses committed here might have earned Fay, as a first offender, a 
30-day jail sentence, a fine and several hundred hours of community service, in 
the form of street and car cleaning, as a condition of probation. To me, that 
appears a just desert for spray-painting parked cars and harboring "stolen 
property" (a stash of street signs).  
</P>
<P>
 Corporal punishment may be tough, but it's not very smart, and neither is it 
cheap, just or necessary.

THE BEAR IS JUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR; RUSSIA: THE DAYS OF BEING THE WEST'S LACKEY 
ARE OVER, AS THOSE WHO STAND FOR A STRONG, PROUD NATION COME TO THE FORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VLADIMIR POZNER, Vladimir Pozner, a journalist in the former Soviet Union, 
co-hosts Pozner & Donahue on CNBC-TV and hosts a similar show in Moscow. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Back in the bad old days, the American media had only negative things to say 
about the Soviet Union. Not that there was really much information offered, but 
whatever it was, it was all negative. In TV reports even the skies over Moscow 
were always gray. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, of course, things have changed. Americans get a far greater quantity and 
variety of information concerning Russia. But, considering how many U.S. news 
bureaus are stationed there, it is still amazing to see what is missed. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, no note has been made -- at least in any of the mainstream media 
-- of what I think is a truly significant event. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 4, the influential Nezavisimaya Gazeta (Independent Newspaper) 
published the results of a monthly poll, conducted by the highly regarded 
Moscow-based Vox Populi Public Opinion Research Institute. The poll, "Russia's 
100 Leading Politicians," is considered by both the Establishment and the 
public as an accurate reflection of a politician's rating. The latest results 
were a shocker. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in more than a year, Yeltsin slipped from first place to 
second. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin took over the top spot. Acting 
quickly to heal whatever wound this news might have dealt to Yeltsin's ego, 
Chernomyrdin chastised the media for "sensationalizing meaningless political 
ratings" -- something he would hardly have done, had he indeed considered those 
ratings meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was more. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitaly Churkin, Russia's deputy minister of foreign affairs, a key player in 
putting the Bosnian Serbs in synch with the NATO-energized peace process, saw 
his standings in the poll catapulted from a tie for 99th place, in January, to 
a tie for 18th. 
</P>
<P>
 Third place went to Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a name unfamiliar to most 
Americans, Russia-watchers included (but then, it took most of them a long time 
to pay attention to Vladimir Zhirinovsky). 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, America's darling reformist Yegor Gaidar slipped from 3rd place to 
9th. 
</P>
<P>
 Chernomyrdin, Churkin and Luzhkov have all demonstrated that, first, they 
firmly believe in Russia's inherent greatness and will stand up for its 
interests both in the "near abroad" (the former republics) and elsewhere; 
second, that they have faith in Russia's ability to solve its problems, and, 
most important, this troika has never hidden its distaste for Western recipes 
-- economic or political. 
</P>
<P>
 In a country not accustomed to polling, not involved in the game-playing that 
becomes inevitable when polling becomes at least as much of a political 
instrument as a method of gauging attitudes, the results of a monthly poll, 
which have been consistent for more than a year and suddenly undergoes dramatic 
change, should be taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the end of the Gorbachev years and the summer of 1993, Russia offered 
the West a unique window of opportunity. The country was at a crossroads. 
Disenchanted and disillusioned with their past, the people were prepared to 
accept a radically different future. A George Marshall would have been quick to 
capitalize on this. He would have mapped out a strategic plan to channel funds 
and investments to pressure points in Russia. This time, America would not have 
to go it alone, as after World War II in Europe, but could work with its 
European and Japanese allies. The results would have been spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, there was no George Marshall. In fact, there never existed any coherent 
policy, let alone grand strategy, toward post-Soviet Russia. Instead there 
persists the pernicious and arrogant view that America won, and Russia lost, 
the Cold War and therefore Russia should be treated as a defeated foe. A foe 
that must please America if it expects to be rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
 In Russia, a country that was not defeated and whose people never considered 
themselves vanquished, this policy has fed anti-American sentiment, set people 
against reformists seen as being pro-Western and slammed shut that window of 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 It has brought to the forefront politicians who stand for a strong, proud 
Russia that marches to its own drummer. 
</P>
<P>
 They are neither Zhirinovsky-like ultra-nationalists, nor Communist Party 
ideologues. They are conservative pragmatists who will pursue Russia's 
interests, and they are here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, I attended a news conference in Washington. Addressing the 
audience on the issue of Russian-U.S. relations, one of the most knowledgeable 
journalists in that area, Martin Walker of the Manchester Guardian, said: "The 
time when Russia agreed to play pet poodle to George Bush and Bill Clinton is 
gone for good." He did not say the bear was back, but I think the poll no one 
here has paid attention to says just that.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lt. KEVIN H. WILLIAMS of Colton, an LAPD supervisor who is planning to move 
back to Los Angeles, comments about the ACLU study that says 83% of the force 
lives outside the city. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City residency requirements create an environment where employees are exposed 
to the good and bad of the city on a daily basis. It can also have the positive 
effect of motivating law-enforcement officers to take a more active role in 
improving the standard of life. 
</P>
<P>
 A failure to strongly encourage city employees to reside within Los Angeles 
promotes the occupying army mind-set the ACLU spoke of. An equally destructive 
byproduct of non-residency is the fact that these workers are supporting the 
tax base of other cities. Their children attend schools outside the city. They 
shop outside the city. And the extended commutes cause significant pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it is time to rethink the 1974 amendment to the state Constitution, 
which barred residency requirements. Regardless, the city should establish a 
goal of 100% residency. Incentives for living in the city could include 
additional points given in the civil-service promotion process, salary 
incentives, rental subsidies and low-and no-interest mortgage loans.

JAZZ REVIEW; VIBIST MILT JACKSON COMES IN FRESH AND CLEAR AT CATALINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Milt Jackson always sounds best on his own, outside his role as vibraphonist 
for the Modern Jazz Quartet. That fact was underscored Tuesday at Catalina Bar 
& Grill when the 71-year-old vibist, long the physical force inside the 
intellectually heavy MJQ, pushed a strong, locally-based quartet in a 
commanding first set composed mostly of standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Credited for some 40 years as the artist who carried the vibraphone into the 
be-bop era, Jackson continues to sound fresh, finding new ways to make the 
blues sing while propelled by the strong tempos of the post-bop era. His work 
on Sam Jones' "Unit Seven" was typical as he filled the up-tempo workout with 
short, finely hammered lines that played to the tune's percussive attractions 
before racing through longer, melodic phrases. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson was at his best on a Latin-paced "This Masquerade," which found him 
fortifying the theme with clever variations that emphasized the pop tune's 
gentrified blues elements. On John Clayton's "Serious Grease," he worked in a 
more rhythmic fashion to emphasize the piece's funky nature. 
</P>
<P>
 The set was filled with the kind of breaks, beat shifts and practiced endings 
atypical of pickup bands. Bassist Andy Simpkins supplied firm foundations and 
up-register decorations while pianist Art Hillary, one of the instrument's most 
distinguished spokesmen, opened up harmonic landscapes for Jackson's 
exploration. The upstart of the group, baby-faced drummer Willie Jones III, 
seemed especially attuned to his leader's attack, echoing Jackson's phrases 
with snare rattle and cymbal shadings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Milt Jackson at Catalina Bar & Grill, 1640 N. Cahuenga Blvd., Hollywood, 
(213) 466-2210. $12 cover ($15 Fri.-Sat.) and two drink minimum. Jackson plays 
two sets at 9 and 11 p.m., through Sunday. BILL KOHLHAASE

ART GALLERIES: SYROP'S 'DEAD': CHILLING, MIND-BOGGLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mitchell Syrop's latest installation combines the logic of crossword puzzles 
with the awkwardness of high school and the unevenness of cheap wallpaper. At 
once chilling, goofy and mind-boggling, "Why I Wish I Was Dead" is the most 
ambitious, engaging and thought-provoking work he has made. 
</P>
<P>
 An expanded version of his 1992 exhibition at the Rosamund Felsen Gallery, 
Syrop's work-in-progress at the Santa Monica Museum of Art is a project he has 
worked on intermittently since 1974, when he was still an art student. 
</P>
<P>
 Its current manifestation includes five gigantic wall-mounted grids of taut 
monofilament from which hang thousands of 8-by-10-inch laser-printed senior 
portraits. A sixth web of monofilament runs between two walls, allowing Syrop 
to suspend yearbook photos in three-dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Being works in progress, more than half of the slots in the grids are still 
empty. Scattered around the floor are stacks of candidates for many of the 
blank spaces. Some recently printed images, to which hooks haven't yet been 
affixed, are push-pinned to the wall in the positions they'll soon occupy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of the gallery, cardboard boxes packed with portraits are lined 
up next to Syrop's desk, where he is scheduled to work on and off for the 
duration of the exhibit. Despite the presence of a computer, scanner and 
printer, his quirky research is low-tech, hands-on and labor-intensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Syrop uses the computer only to enlarge, crop and reverse the photographs -- 
to ensure that the faces are the same scale, that clothing is an incidental 
trait, and that the heads tip at similar angles. 
</P>
<P>
 Culled from what must be a daunting collection of yearbooks from 1968-1976 
(the year color photos where introduced), these black-and-white pictures of 
graduating seniors are arranged in groupings that share characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
 With an impressive sensitivity to detail, Syrop masterfully matches 
hairstyles, poses, facial features and expressions. Scanning his grids -- the 
largest of which has slots for almost 1,000 pictures -- is like watching a 
slow-motion, low-budget version of morphing: a fair-skinned boy with wide 
sideburns and bangs mutates into a curly-haired nerd with glasses and glazed 
eyes. And so on, until extremely different people are linked in a potentially 
infinite series of striking overlaps and strange similarities. 
</P>
<P>
 Syrop's art is exciting because there are no borders between his fluid 
groupings. Every trait that might establish the identity of a subgroup also 
belongs to at least one other cluster of students. The viewer's imaginative 
participation is required to make connections among myriad differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Although each of the wall-mounted grids contains only one category of people 
-- such as white men, black men, white women or teachers -- it isn't difficult 
to imagine that Syrop could find enough portraits to link all his grids. Boxes 
labeled "Spain" and "Asia" suggest that this might be in the works. His small, 
3-D grid, which includes students and teachers, takes a step in this direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in its current state, Syrop's project is a noble antidote to forcing 
individuals into restrictive categories. His yearbook pictures are inspiring 
because they ask us to expand our capacity to discern differences within 
seemingly homogenous groups. By implication, Syrop's project invites us to 
imagine a social order with as many categories as members. 
</P>
<P>
 * Santa Monica Museum of Art, 2437 Main St., Santa Monica, (310) 399-0433, 
through May 15. Closed Mondays and Tuesdays. Patience Is Rewarded: Scot 
Heywood's paintings require considerable patience. At Ace Gallery, 14 
powerfully understated works from the past three years generously reward the 
time you give them. 
</P>
<P>
 First, one's eyes must adjust from the hustle and bustle of the street before 
being able to discern whether Heywood's minimal abstractions are monochromes or 
consist of subtle combinations of different colors with matching values. 
</P>
<P>
 When capable of making these distinctions, the colors of the two-, three- and 
four-panel works seem to change. Gun-metal gray drifts toward olive-green; 
brick red softens into delicious burgundy; medicinal white melts into buttery, 
bleached gold; and the cold black of the void segues into the rich brown of the 
earth or the deep blue of the sky after sunset. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Heywood's paintings are hard-edged and geometric, they're not 
reductive. They don't strip art down to a single, essential experience or 
pursue a sterile idea of purity. On the contrary, they embrace the 
unpredictability of ongoing experience, challenging our visual acuity by 
focusing our eyes on hair-splitting distinctions. 
</P>
<P>
 To get us to focus on exactly what we're seeing, the 42-year-old, L.A.-based 
painter purges reference from his work. Although his triptychs echo the 
structure of Renaissance altarpieces and his horizontal diptychs recall the 
format of landscape paintings, neither of these genres inform his series. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, Heywood's abstractions don't look like watered-down versions 
of other more famous paintings. Wholly his own, they belong to an original body 
of work. 
</P>
<P>
 His most ambitious and eccentric series consists of four-part paintings 
divided diagonally and hung at 45-degree angles. Each looks like a baseball 
diamond with a fault running through it: Half the field seems to have slid out 
of position, causing second-base to travel halfway to first, which has ended up 
in the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it's impossible to determine where the centers of these paintings are 
located, they demand to be apprehended intuitively. Initially, they appear to 
be off-balance and out-of-control. After awhile, they settle into an oddly 
classical equilibrium. 
</P>
<P>
 Our struggle to concentrate gradually relaxes until easy-going perusal takes 
over. More appropriate to Heywood's slow paintings, this drifting, 
indeterminate attention allows us to follow their complexity almost 
effortlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ace Gallery, 5514 Wilshire Blvd., 2nd floor, (213) 935-4411, through April 
30. Closed Sundays and Mondays. Punchless: In the past three months, three 
accomplished, L.A.-based abstract painters have exhibited sculpture along with 
their two-dimensional work. Unlike Roy Dowell's and Sabina Ott's successful 
forays into three-dimensions, Nancy Evans' fence-like constructions pack none 
of the punch of her paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sue Spaid Fine Art, six acrylics on panel are Evans' best paintings. Less 
cluttered and more crisp than before, her new works flaunt a wide-range of 
painterly tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans often coaxes pigment suspended in gel medium to behave like a collage. 
Even when seemingly torn, the surfaces of her layered paintings still seem 
gloppy and liquid. Contradictory fusions such as this charge her art with 
intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
 To Evans' credit, no two paintings look alike. It is as if she has momentarily 
paused on a path of rapid discovery to carefully pursue six separate strands 
generated by her wild, painterly experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of these paths could sustain a significant, extensive series. In the 
past, rampant, almost out-of-control sampling has defined Evans' method. 
Lately, refinement and sophistication have begun to enter the picture. More 
focus should ensure that her paintings will continue to move further away from 
her sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sue Spaid Fine Art, 7454 1/2 Beverly Blvd., (213) 935-6153, through April

CLUB REVIEW; BAR DELUXE: ZEN AND THE ART OF RESURRECTING HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The intersection of Las Palmas Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard doesn't exactly 
conjure up visions of elegance. Downtrodden buildings and graffiti-splattered 
restaurants line the street, which despite its fabled past has come to embody 
anti-glamour. 
</P>
<P>
 But a 4-month-old nightclub, the Buddha-themed Bar Deluxe, has taken a chance 
on the district, and it appears to be paying off. Much like the Lava Lounge -- 
which spruced up a nearby strip mall when it opened its tiki-style doors at the 
same time -- Bar Deluxe is drawing folks into the neighborhood. The very red 
and very dark bi-level club -- which contains numerous renderings of the rotund 
deity -- attracts a non-poseur crowd by offering an eclectic selection of 
music, drinks and food. 
</P>
<P>
 Country, zydeco and blues acts play upstairs a few nights a week, and 
Tuesday's deejayed selection of vintage punk is particularly inspired. From 
Jonathan Richman's "Dancing in a Lesbian Bar" to X's "Los Angeles" and ample 
Sex Pistols selections, the music suits the environment like a well-worn combat 
boot -- which you may need when it's time to leave Buddha's watchful gaze and 
hit the street. But with the words to "Los Angeles" -- X's homage to 
Hollywood's seedy underside -- fresh in your memory, anything less would be a 
bit disappointing.

 In "Celeste" he explored a loving bond between the ailing Marcel Proust and 
his sturdy, unsophisticated but unswervingly devoted housekeeper. In 
"Sugarbaby" he delved into a romance between a zaftig and confident mortuary 
worker and a handsome subway train driver, and in "Bagdad Cafe" he established 
a devoted, mutually supportive tie between an unresourceful stranded German 
woman and the overworked African American proprietor of a ramshackle motel and 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in the endearing, remarkably assured and stunning-looking "Salmonberries," 
a kind of serious -- yet humor-spiked -- counterpart of "Bagdad Cafe," Adlon 
takes on his greatest challenge yet, letting us wonder whether a friendship 
forged against all odds can turn into a romance. To tell his offbeat story -- 
and just as unexpectedly evoke the need for reconciliation between the reunited 
Germanys -- Adlon has selected a locale even more remote than the desert 
roadside compound of "Bagdad Cafe." It's the actual northwestern Alaskan 
outpost of Kotzebue, a tiny community of utilitarian tar paper houses, 
converted barracks and house trailers. 
</P>
<P>
 For 21 years it has been home to the local librarian, Roswitha (Rosel Zech), 
now 45, an elegant, formal East German emigre who has suddenly become the 
object of the attentions of a youth inarticulate to the point of rage. Not 
until the youth stops knocking books off shelves and instead abruptly disrobes 
does Roswitha realize that her suitor is a woman, played by k.d lang (whose 
haunting song "Barefoot" is heard on the soundtrack). Abandoned in Kotzebue as 
a baby, she bears the name of the town itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Craving friendship, love and a sense of identity, Kotzebue is so doggedly 
persistent that she breaks down the severe Roswitha's resistance to the extent 
that she actually enables this remote woman to confront a tragic past that has 
had her in its thrall the entire time she's been in Alaska. Roswitha's only joy 
has come in gathering salmonberries, but her increasing reclusiveness means 
that her shelf-lined bedroom is now crowded with jars of the preserved berries 
that she had intended to give away. With the utmost sensitivity, Adlon raises 
crucial questions of cultural and sexual identity. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a couple of deft moments from the late Chuck Connors as Kotzebue's 
seedy foster father and a wrenching scene played almost wordlessly by German 
actor Wolfgang Steinberg, but "Salmonberries," gorgeously photographed by Tom 
Sigel, is by and large a two-character story, and novice actress lang is as 
impressive as the veteran Zech. After lang asked Adlon to direct a music video 
for her, he wrote the script of "Salmonberries" especially for her. 
Unaccountably, this prize-winning film has had to wait for more than two years 
for a theatrical release.

<TEXT>

 Why did turn-of-the-century French cuisine call for so many truffles? Sure, it 
was upper-crusty showoff cooking, but it's also true that there were just a lot 
more truffles in those days. About 2,000 tons of black truffles were harvested 
in 1914, but recent years have been averaging only five or six tons.One reason: 
A lot of France's truffle-bearing oak forests got in the way of one or another 
of this century's world wars. Tea Reading

 Most people imagine government-sponsored conferences to be dull events. But 
when Edward L. Menning DVM, executive vice president of the National Assn. of 
Federal Veterinarians, spoke at a food safety summit hosted by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture in Washington March 31, the audience encountered the 
Howard Beale of the food world.Menning delivered a dose of stomach-turning 
tales of modern meat plants that were more reminiscent of Upton Sinclair's "The 
Jungle" than the sanitary image the food industry portrays. "Even today, there 
is no way of telling what goes into a hamburger or hot dog," he said in one of 
his more printable remarks. Response from shocked attendees was initially slow 
in coming. One industry person simply said Menning's warnings were 
"remarkable." DANIEL P. PUZO

MEATLESS FEASTS; INDIA'S VEGETARIAN SPLENDORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In India, vegetarian food is so highly developed that it can easily outshine 
dense, chunky, chewy meat dishes. Religion, scarcity or high cost of meat and 
generations of tradition make vegetarianism a basic lifestyle in that vast 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Some vegetarians are very strict -- I have seen Jain priests with masks over 
their faces to keep them from accidentally inhaling insects. Others are more 
relaxed. Bengali vegetarians eat fish because it's abundant in that coastal 
state. So do inhabitants of the southern state of Kerala. And some vegetarians 
are willing to eat soups made with meat broth although they avoid meat itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Each region has its own specialties, its own way of seasoning. The western 
state of Gujarat, which is heavily vegetarian, leans toward sweet tastes. South 
Indian cooks perform incredible feats with lentils. Grains such as millet are 
important in the desert state of Rajasthan. And Punjabis adore simple greens 
with corn bread. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain hotels such as the Woodlands and Dasaprakash groups provide only 
vegetarian food. But all restaurants and hotels in India have plenty of choices 
for non-meat-eaters. Some glossy five-star hotels even set up twin lunch buffet 
lines -- one for vegetarians, the other for those who eat meat. 
</P>
<P>
 On Indian trains, you don't order by the dish but by dietary preference. The 
tray of food -- either with meat or vegetarian -- is brought to your seat, like 
an airline meal. At least that's the way it is in the second-class cars in 
which I have traveled. Chicken curry -- the usual "meat" entree -- was pretty 
good on some routes, not so good on others. But the vegetarian food was always 
wonderful. It's also a wise choice if you are worried about food safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Clever seasonings and tremendous variety make this food addictive. And there's 
plenty of it wherever immigrants from India have settled. Southern California's 
Indian restaurants always provide vegetarian options and a few serve vegetarian 
food only. A large part of the inventory at Indian markets here consists of the 
lentils, rice and spices that vegetarians employ with such artistry. Here is a 
look at how they cook. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are together cooking," says Phulan Chander, her Punjabi way of speaking 
spilling over into English. She smiles, thinking of husband Ramesh and the 
smooth way they work in the kitchen. "No fighting," she insists. 
</P>
<P>
 Their home in Hawthorne is indeed peaceful as they put together a multi-course 
vegetarian meal. The food is Punjabi -- except for a curry leaf here and there. 
This strongly flavored leaf appears in South Indian dishes, not northern food. 
But when you have a treeful just outside your kitchen, you are tempted to 
experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 This day, the Chanders are cooking the tiny black legumes called urad dal . 
Ramesh handles the dal while Phulan rolls out matti -- biscuit-like cakes that 
Punjabis eat with tea. Flavored with the aromatic spice ajwain , the cakes 
magically turn into multilayered pastries when fried. Already on the table is 
another tea snack -- cashews fried golden-brown and sprinkled with cayenne, 
black pepper and exotic-tasting chat masala.  
</P>
<P>
 Still to come are ravishingly spiced eggplant -- baingan bharta -- and potato 
dumplings in pale-yellow yogurt sauce. The dumplings, made with chick pea 
flour, are called pakoras. For cool contrast there will be raita , a yogurt 
relish containing tiny balls of deep-fried chick pea batter. These are boondi , 
and you can buy them ready-made in Indian shops, but Phulan makes her own, 
dropping the batter through the holes of a large spoon into hot oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most other Indian women, she bakes chapatis after her guests are seated 
so the breads stay fresh and hot. And she whips together an impromptu lassi 
that has a unique taste, unknown in Western cuisine. This comes from kewra , a 
liquid seasoning extracted from the flowers of the screw pine tree and so 
powerful that it has to be doled out by the drop. 
</P>
<P>
 Over and over as she cooks, Chander says, "I have too many recipes." This does 
not mean that her file is overloaded, just that she knows how to make many 
dishes. And she freely shares her recipes with customers at Bharat Bazaar, the 
Chander family's Indian grocery in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chanders cook Punjabi style, but Sada Siva Rao serves the wildly hot 
dishes of Andhra Pradesh in South India. To experience the fiery intensity of 
Andhra food, eat at Rao's restaurant, the Bombay Grill in West Hollywood. Not 
everything is blistering hot, but when Rao cooks to his own taste, he ladles in 
heaps of blazing red chile powder and big spoonfuls of Southern-style masala -- 
spices ground with coconut. The trick is to temper the heat by eating a little 
curry with a lot of rice, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Rao's tiny restaurant, tucked in the back of a mall near a kosher bakery, 
draws lots of studio people. And the conversation is often heavily spiked with 
English accents because Britishers who know Indian food gather there. 
</P>
<P>
 So do Indians who want foods they can't get elsewhere. One draw is homemade 
pickles: fat garlic cloves with sesame seeds, pickled fresh fenugreek leaves, 
spinach with coriander seeds and others. These are hot too, but one eats them 
in little bites with plain foods like such as rice and yogurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Rao cooks in a truly hot spot. His big range is next to the inferno-like 
tandoor oven. In this feverish setting he tosses handfuls of serrano chiles 
into a pot along with more chile powder than most of us would use in weeks. 
These zip up the intensity of mushroom senagapappu , chewy yellow chana dal 
cooked with mushrooms. Another load of chile powder goes into the tomato sauce 
for guttivankaya , an eggplant dish. Rao hasn't been able to get the baby 
eggplants he prefers for this dish, so he substitutes long, slim Japanese 
eggplant. These he cuts in half, then slivers in quarters, leaving the ends 
attached. Both dishes are hot enough to induce sniffles, tears and even serious 
inner pain. And Rao says the obvious: Season them to your own taste, which 
probably means using a lot less chile powder. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Punjab, there's a wonderful winter dish of spiced mustard greens -- 
saag -- that one eats with bright yellow corn bread called makki ki roti . At 
Nirula's snack shop in New Delhi, the saag is rich with butter, and the 
combination comes with a little cup of shakkar -- brown sugar crystals -- to 
add a tantalizing sweet taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Southern California, you can try the saag and bread at Chameli, a 
North Indian vegetarian restaurant in Rosemead. Owner Hari B. Alipuria, who is 
from Patiala in the Punjab, remembers how his mother slapped the dough on a 
stone slab and baked the tortilla-like breads on a griddle that she sprinkled 
with cornmeal to prevent sticking. In Punjabi homes, the corn was stone-ground 
by hand, he says. That kind of cornmeal is not available in California, so 
Alipuria makes do with a supermarket brand. 
</P>
<P>
 Family tradition was to chop bushels of greens at night. Then Alipuria's 
father would get up early to simmer the saag for hours. Long, slow cooking 
brought out the full flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Alipuria's wife, Linda, who reworked Chameli's recipe to household size, says 
many Punjabis season the dish with only butter and salt. In restaurants here, 
saag is well spiced, and it often includes spinach along with mustard greens. 
</P>
<P>
 Chameli's saag and corn bread do not ooze as much butter as they would in 
India because the chefs are instructed to reduce fats. The breads are lightly 
brushed with butter on one side only, then stacked. A pat of butter should go 
in the center of a bowl of steaming saag, though. Or one can skip the butter 
and sprinkle the saag with Chameli's alternative topping -- fried chopped 
ginger. Or make a good thing even better by using both. 
</P>
<P>
 Paneer bhurji looks a lot like scrambled eggs with tomato sauce, So you're 
surprised to find out that it is cheese -- not Western-style firm cheese but 
soft, freshly clotted milk stirred together with sauteed onions and tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of our favorite dishes. I make it all the time," says Pammi Singh, 
whose husband, Lakhi, owns the Bombay Kitchen on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles. 
Although common in Punjabi households in North India, paneer bhurji is 
difficult to find in restaurants here. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Bombay Kitchen, vegetarians eat it with dal (lentils), whole-wheat 
paratha (a flat Indian bread) and a vegetable dish such as bhindi masala 
(spiced okra), aloo gobi (potatoes and cauliflower) or navratnam curry, 
composed of vegetables and nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 At home, Pammi Singh sometimes adds green peas to make paneer bhurji even more 
colorful. And she always has raita , a yogurt relish, on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bombay Kitchen, only 8 months old, is still undergoing changes. One dish 
headed for the menu is the soothing ginger-lentil soup that Lakhi Singh's 
grandmother would brew up during harsh North Indian cold spells. It's the 
vegetarian version of chicken soup, good for whatever ails you even if the 
weather isn't cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Chanders, Pammi and Lakhi Singh enjoy cooking together at home. "We 
experiment, and if it turns out well, we take it to the restaurant," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian desserts are usually terribly rich, extremely sweet and very 
time-consuming to make. To get the rich taste and thick texture required for 
the many sweets based on milk, one has to boil the milk patiently until it 
reduces and the flavor deepens. Mira Advani, who was born in a part of India 
that is now Pakistan, has figured out how to get around this obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
 When she makes burfi , a candy-like sweet, she cuts down the cooking time by 
using ricotta cheese instead of milk. And she adds nonfat dry milk powder to 
make the mixture thicker. To get the right taste, though, she has to add 
butter. But she watches her diet strictly enough to afford an occasional treat. 
And she trims the fat grams somewhat by using fat-free ricotta. 
</P>
<P>
 Advani teaches vegetarian cooking at the Oaks at Ojai, the Palms in Palm 
Springs and at her home in West Los Angeles. Occasionally she eats fish, but 
for months at a time, she's totally vegetarian. "I just feel it keeps me 
healthy," she says. "It's a way of cutting down on fat. Of course, I love 
vegetables. They're good to eat and so colorful."  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Pakoras are vegetable fritters. In this recipe, they're made only with 
potatoes, but Phulan Chander often combines as many as five vegetables, each 
cut into tiny pieces. The combination might include spinach for attractive 
green color, potato, eggplant, onion and cauliflower.

 This lentil dish appears creamy, but no milk is added. Indian shops can supply 
not only the urad dal (black lentils) but the big, dark - brown pods of 
cardamom, the garam masala and the ghee. Or use clarified butter instead of 
ghee. THE CHANDERS' DAL MAKHANI

 Chana dal (Indian garbanzo) is chewy when cooked, adding texture interest to 
this spicy dish. In the South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, where this recipe 
originated, a meaty mushroom called puttakokulu would be used. It's not 
available here, but ordinary mushrooms work just fine.

CHIPS 'N' CHUTNEY

<P>
 It was another writing group potluck. Chand Desai was assigned to bring hors 
d'oeuvres. He showed up with a couple sacks of blue corn tortilla chips and a 
big bowl of pale-green dip. 
</P>
<P>
 Dip. 
</P>
<P>
 What a perfect name for the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Dip, the slacker of hors d'oeuvres. Dip, adult baby food. Dip, the couch 
potato's staple and the dieter's nemesis. What else adds hundreds of calories 
to the pristine celery stalk and fat-free rice cake? Dip is temptation in its 
most inert, spineless form. Dip is the antithesis of delayed gratification. Dip 
is salty, gooshy and, if you're lucky, high in fat. (Low-fat dips are usually 
too awful to contemplate.) The only true virtue of dip is that it's easy to 
make. 
</P>
<P>
 Next time, I thought, I'll ask Chand to bring the mineral water. 
</P>
<P>
 This was, of course, before I dragged my first tortilla chip through that 
thick, lima bean-green goo. It was cool, smooth, creamy in texture -- and 
packed a hot, gingery wallop of flavor that was curiously familiar. I loaded 
another chip to see if I could trace the source of this familiarity. And 
another. I was mystified, and, therefore, kept dipping and tasting, dipping and 
tasting, which wasn't all that easy, considering there were about 10 other 
people going through the same whooshes of pleasure and mystification.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, we coaxed the recipe from Chand. The secret of this 
cream-cheese-based dip was a classic Gujarati cilantro chutney one encounters 
with Indian appetizers such as samosas and pakoras. Laced with hot chiles, 
lemon and fresh ginger, cilantro chutney is the lawn-green sauce usually served 
in tandem with the milder, sweeter dark-brown tamarind chutney. 
</P>
<P>
 Chand's mother, Helen Desai, came up with this dip in her ongoing effort to 
make her favorite Indian flavors more accessible to the tender palates of her 
American friends. I myself have now brought it to countless potlucks, always 
with great success. 
</P>

 This dip goes with virtually any chip or raw vegetable. It also makes a 
cucumber sandwich sublime. GREEN CHUTNEY DIP

 In bowl blend cilantro, ginger, garlic, chiles, cumin, lemon juice, water and 
salt. Blended mixture should be classic chutney consistency, not too dry, not 
too thin. If too dry, add more water. If too wet, add unsweetened coconut. Mix 
with softened cream cheese. Serve with chips, pita wedges or crudites. Makes 2

MEATLESS FEASTS; WAY DOWN SOUTH IN DAKSHIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chandra Padmanabhan sets out the makings for yogurt morning and evening. In 
the heat of Madras, the milk quickly curdles, so she has fresh yogurt on hand 
all the time. She never has to rely on electric yogurt machines, thermos jugs 
or ranges with warm pilot lights. And she never has to wrap her bowl of 
fermenting yogurt in bulky blankets to make the warmth last. Or resort to 
buying yogurt at the market. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's a good thing, because south Indian vegetarians like Padmanabhan use 
lots of yogurt, which Indians call "curd." They put it into relishes, salads, 
sauces and beverages, and they stir it into rice as they eat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last course is always the soothing, gentle curd rice, so good for the 
stomach," writes Padmanabhan, describing a typical meal in her book, "Dakshin: 
Vegetarian Dishes From South India" (HarperSan Francisco: $26). First published 
in India in 1992, "Dakshin" has since been reworked and re-photographed for 
Western distribution.  
</P>
<P>
 When Padmanabhan staged a luncheon in Madras early last year to show off the 
book, curd rice was included. The rice is rich and complex, seasoned with the 
spicy tastes of ginger and hot chile and the fresh herbal accents of cilantro 
and curry leaves. Chewy bits of lentil add nutty texture and protein. And the 
yogurt contributes a tart, mellow note. Usually, Padmanabhan adds diced green 
mango, but this time she had stirred in small green grapes from Hyderabad, 
along with cucumber and carrot. 
</P>
<P>
 Dakshina is the Sanskrit word for south. The food of this part of India is 
almost unknown in the United States, where Northern Indian food predominates. 
Yet it is very popular within India. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern cookery has its own vocabulary. Padmanabhan writes of thick, soupy, 
lentil-rich sambars ; thinner, spicy rasams , which are eaten like soup, 
spooned over rice and sometimes sipped from a glass; poriyals , which are dry 
vegetable curries; kootus , which are moderately moist, and pachadi , the 
southern equivalent of the north Indian yogurt raita.  
</P>
<P>
 The south is rice-eating country. Water accompanies meals, and the coffee is 
famous, as are the dosais , big lentil-and-rice crepes that are cooked on a 
griddle and eaten either plain or stuffed. Coconut palms grow profusely, so 
coconut meat and coconut milk appear in the recipes. Copra -- sun-dried coconut 
meat from which oil is extracted -- is also used in cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 One unique southern seasoning is the curry leaf, a pointy leaf that, according 
to Dakshin's glossary, has "a flavor reminiscent of curry powder." The glossary 
is an add-on for Western readers -- there was none in the original Indian 
edition -- and it's apparent that a Western editor unversed in Indian food 
wrote that definition, because the leaves actually taste nothing like curry 
powder. But they're available fresh in Southern California, so try them in 
Padmanabhan's curd rice. The dish resembles a rice salad and translates very 
well to our warm climate. CURD RICE

WINE: SELLING SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S FORGOTTEN TREASURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The cash flow problems some wineries face may solve one of the problems 
impatient wine lovers face. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the trappings of the wealthy, the jet set, the in-crowd -- or whatever 
they're calling the sophisticated these days -- is the ability to pop into the 
wine cellar and pull out a 20-year-old bottle of red wine to serve guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble is, few Americans are into aging wine. We are an instant-gratification 
society. But people who like well-aged wine don't mind paying for the privilege 
of having it. 
</P>
<P>
 Some retail wine shops do buy large amounts of red wine at release and age it 
for a decade before selling it. But there are three problems: Precious few 
shops want to tie up their money this way, those that do often have poor 
storage conditions and the price they end up asking for an old wine is 
generally too high. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two or three years, however, a number of California wineries have 
been dipping into their own wine libraries and offering selected wines from the 
past. The reasons are numerous, but mainly relate to the fact that since 1986, 
per-capita U.S. wine consumption has fallen 25%, slowing cash flow at wineries. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, established wineries rarely get the public attention that is 
accorded to new, glitzy brands, and this is a way for them to toot their own 
horn. Older, well-established wineries, lacking a new story to tell, are 
finding out that selling their mature wines is quite a draw -- and not at all 
bad for the cash flow, either.  
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, these older wines have been stored perfectly at the winery 
(occasionally in subterranean caves), and are offered at such fair prices it 
may make the wine shop or restaurant owner look greedy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, most re-released older wines were in short supply -- five cases 
of this, 10 cases of that. But current offerings of older wines are in 
substantial amounts. In some cases, these wines were held back for a specific 
purpose, such as for export or for special restaurants. Then years passed 
before someone realized there was a lot of inventory that could be turned into 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
 One winemaker who knows of the greatness of perfectly stored red wine is Clos 
du Val owner Bernard Portet, who was born in France and reared at Chateau 
Lafite-Rothschild, where his father was director. There he gained an 
appreciation for mature wine, so at Clos du Val he created a huge wine library. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing his wines rarely are showy when released but that they age 
beautifully, Portet was pleased last month to re-release 4,500 cases of eight 
different older red wines from his library. 
</P>
<P>
 "A wine doesn't have to be powerful in all of its elements to be enjoyable," 
said Portet the other day as we sat and sipped his spectacular 1984 Cabernet, a 
wine of immense richness and charm, one that still hasn't shown an age-induced 
change in color and whose aroma is only now giving evidence of its maturity. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a wine that can age another 10 years," he said. "There's still fruit 
and the wine hasn't gotten to a peak." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1984 Clos du Val Cabernet, released in 1987 at a suggested retail price of 
$15, probably would command $50 in a retail wine shop today. The winery is 
offering it now with a suggested price of $27 -- not much more than many young 
Cabernets. For comparison, Clos du Val's currently available 1989 Cabernet 
Sauvignon sells for $18. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Charles Krug Winery re-released more than 8,000 cases of its 
Vintage Selection Cabernets dating back to 1973, including 72 cases of its 
excellent 1974. And Dry Creek Winery in Sonoma; Sterling Vineyards in the Napa 
Valley, and Carneros Creek Winery in Carneros all are offering wide selections 
of wines dating back two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Krug's 1974 "VS" Cabernet is being offered at a suggested price of 
$50. Charles Krug's 1988 "VS" Cabernet sells for $28.50. I had a bottle of '74 
Krug "VS" from my cellar two years ago and found it to be quite mature, but 
still holding lovely fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to forget that Charles Krug has made very good wine for a very long 
time," says a winery spokesman, adding that the re-release of such a large 
amount of wine didn't occur for a particular reason. "We just found that the 
library kept growing and we decided it was a good time to make these mature 
wines available," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clos du Val and Krug aren't alone. About a dozen other wineries are also 
re-releasing wines to add luster to their current-release list. Some of them 
are making a fuss about it; some of them are doing it very quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 One unpublicized program is at Sterling Vineyards. Visitors to the winery 
tasting room near Calistoga can buy dozens of wines from various vintages in 
several sizes of bottles, all at fair prices. A winery executive said the 
program is also open to callers. For a faxed list of what's available call the 
Sterling Collections line, (800) 726-6136. Wine will be shipped to states where 
such shipments are legal. 
</P>
<P>
 Another long list of older wines is from Carneros Creek, the first winery 
founded in the Carneros (1971). Owner/winemaker Francis Mahoney is now offering 
a huge selection of older vintages of its red wines, including Pinot Noirs back 
to 1976 and Cabernets back to 1972. For a faxed copy of the winery's offerings 
call (707) 253-9463. 
</P>
<P>
 Dry Creek Vineyards in Sonoma County is offering 42 red wines dating back to 
1977. Dry Creek's 1984 Cabernet is available at $15 per bottle. For a faxed 
copy of available wines call (707) 433-1000. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that so many wineries are re-releasing older wines at this particular 
time may be coincidence, though one winery executive termed the re-releases "a 
cry for help for these poor little guys whose distribution is drying up and who 
have to compete against better-funded wineries able to charge less for their 
wines." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even as well-financed and successful a winery as Robert Mondavi 
occasionally offers a few older wines at its Napa Valley tasting room. Today 
the Mondavi Winery has nothing older for sale, but a winery spokesman said when 
a wine starts to reach maturity, it will be offered in select markets or at the 
tasting room. 
</P>
<P>
 Others who sell older wines regularly: 
</P>
<P>
 * Chappellet Vineyard always makes a 10-year-old Cabernet available 
nationally. The current 1984 Cabernet carries a suggested retail price of $25. 
It's an excellent wine and a bargain. About 4,000 cases are available, and a 
few restaurants are offering the wine at low prices. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chateau Montelena is offering its 1986 Cabernet, originally released at $30, 
at $45. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trefethen Vineyards, one of the few wineries to offer a white wine in its 
Library Reserve program, now has Trefethen's 1987 Chardonnay for $30. 
</P>
<P>
 * Louis Martini, which long has made older red wines available, is currently 
offering a six-pack of its Monte Rosso Cabernets that includes two bottles of 
the 1979 and one each of 1982, 1983, 1984 and 1985. The box sells for $110. 
Also, bottles of '79 Martini Zinfandel are $15 each. The winery will ship these 
wines to consumers who place mail or phone orders. For details call (707) 
963-2736. 
</P>
<P>
 * Raymond Winery has a library ranging back to 1978. Pricing is modest -- 
though appears to be fairly casual. For instance, Raymond's 1981 Cabernet today 
would be about $35. For details call Raymond at (707) 963-3141. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the only way to get older wines is to visit the winery. For 
instance, at Beringer Vineyards' Founder's Room, above its Rhine House tasting 
room, consumers may purchase samples or bottles of older Private Reserve 
Cabernets. Current vintages available are 1982 ($60), 1984 ($50), 1987 ($55), 
and 1988 ($40). Wine of the Week 
</P>
<P>
 1993 Joseph Drouhin Chablis "Premier Cru" ($20) -- Burgundy prices took a 
sharp rise a decade ago, particularly among the Chardonnay-based White 
Burgundies. It was the era of economic megagrowth, and Americans and Japanese 
were treating themselves. By 1988, an average bottle of French Chablis had 
reached the $25 mark and Premier Cru Chablis was close to $50. But the wines 
weren't necessarily worth those prices; high demand had induced some producers 
to "stretch" production, and the quality of White Burgundy had become less 
reliable. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three years, however, the worldwide recession has chopped demand 
back, and almost all White Burgundy is coming down in price. By a happy 
coincidence, 1992 and 1993 were good vintages. 
</P>
<P>
 This gorgeous wine is not one of the fat-and-flabby Chablis of recent 
invention but a classic Chablis, lean and delicate. It has wonderful spiced 
apple and melon fruit and a fine, crisp finish with long aftertaste. Drouhin is 
known for good-value Chablis, and this wine has it. With discounts, some 
retailers will have this wine for $15 or so, and at that price it's the best 
high-quality White Burgundy value I've tasted in nearly a decade.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: YING & YANG CHOW

By JONATHAN GOLD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the astonishing things about browsing through the hundreds of Asian 
restaurants in the San Gabriel Valley is how often you come across a place that 
serves not just an unusual dish or two, but a whole cuisine that may be new to 
you -- an unusually Fujian-influenced Taiwanese seafood menu or perhaps a kind 
of noodleshop cooking practically unknown outside Inner Mongolia. No mini-mall 
restaurant is so small that it may not surprise you; no opulent wedding-banquet 
menu can safely be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver Wing is a tiny place in a mall with a Vietnamese supermarket near the 
far edge of Alhambra, one mirror-walled restaurant among many, with a cold case 
for salads and a dozen tidy tables. Even if you have been to Silver Wing five 
times, you may not be able to tell it apart from the other restaurants in the 
strip without referring to the photocopied menu taped up in a window. But 
Silver Wing is probably the only place in the area specializing in the famous 
dumplings and noodles and buns of Yangzhou, a small city north of Shanghai, and 
the breakfast is as delicious as you can imagine. (The breakfast menu is in 
Chinese, but a waitress will be glad to translate.) 
</P>
<P>
 Check it out some weekend around noon. Silver Wing is suddenly crowded with 
people eating dumplings; slurping from big, steaming bowls of soy milk; gnawing 
on freshly fried Chinese crullers that look a little like churros that have 
been surgically joined at the waist; digging into Chinese spaghetti. Salted soy 
milk, like a suspension of pulverized bean curd flavored strongly with pepper 
and black vinegar, is garnished with sliced crullers and a tiny dice of 
pungent, salt-preserved vegetables; sweet soy milk is bland, slightly chalky, 
subtly flavored, a cream-smooth analog to the hot tofu so popular at dim sum 
lunches. (Avoid the rice soup, which is just that: unflavored rice soup.) At 
breakfast there are also hot ovals of flaky sesame bread, stuffed with thin, 
cool slices of gelatinous beef or spiced pork, crunchy and soft and chewy all 
at once. 
</P>
<P>
 What are called "steamed slice rolls" -- ask for fried steamed slice rolls -- 
are little beehive-shaped things that are sweet like doughnuts, crunchy-crusted 
and dusted with cinnamon sugar. Cat's-ear noodles -- unfortunately listed on 
the typo-ridden menu as "stir-fried sliced douch with vegetables" -- are firm, 
delicious things that actually do look a bit like cat's ears, sauteed with the 
eggs, meat, crunchy black fungus and mushrooms you might associate with great 
mu shu pork. Dry bean curd Yangchow-style may be the single best dish in the 
restaurant, the thinnest julienne strips of dry tofu, the texture of soft 
cheese, tossed with tiny shreds of white-meat chicken, Chinese ham and a little 
black vinegar, a dish you do not eat so much as inhale. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver Wing serves a terrific version of the Yangchow region's famous lion's 
head meat dumplings -- baseball-size lumps of fat minced pork cooked slowly in 
a gravy of stock and soy, with a flavor whose intensity belies the meatballs' 
lightness. Little bamboo steamersful of cut up spareribs, heady with wine and 
ginger, are steamed under a thick coat of coarse rice crumbs and sit on a bed 
of yams. The usual Chinese vegetables are good -- string beans fried with salty 
crumbles of pork, spicy eggplant -- and there is a wonderful, delicate dish of 
salted vegetables sauteed with fresh soybeans and fragile tendrils of tofu 
skin. 
</P>
<P>
 There are almost too many kinds of dumplings to count: shiu mai shaped like 
little nuclear cooling towers, stuffed with a savory mince of pine nuts, pork 
and sticky rice; incredible pan-fried pork bao , juicy and gingery, garnished 
with chopped scallions; dumplings stuffed with a fragrant mince of preserved 
vegetables and pork; green-onion pancakes (just OK); garlicky pan-fried 
dumplings; wonderful sweet dumplings stuffed with chopped dates. I have been to 
Silver Wing maybe eight times in the last couple of months, and I have tried to 
order a different kind of dumpling on each visit, but I have barely made a dent 
in the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 * Silver Wing: 1265 E. Valley Blvd., Alhambra (in Quang Hoa shopping center), 
(818) 308-1890. Open Tuesday-Sunday, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Cash only. No alcohol. 
Lot parking. Takeout. Lunch or dinner for two, $10-$18.

GOOD COOKING: SPRING AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY MANDEL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We may talk all year about eating light, but when spring comes, we take it 
seriously. Down with the deep, hearty stews and soups of winter. We're ready 
for quickly cooked, brightly flavored dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamb is often a popular spring selection, but in keeping with the lightness 
theme, I prefer fresh fish, especially salmon, which is easily and quickly 
cooked. With just minimal enhancement, the salmon here is given Asian 
overtones, both in the glaze and in the scorched onions in the accompanying 
crisp, almost salad-like stir-fry of fennel, sugar snap peas and red pepper. 
Steamed rice would complete the main course. 
</P>
<P>
 For dessert, a citrus mousse garnished with fresh raspberries and sauced with 
pureed raspberries just bursting with flavor and color captures the mood of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here, salmon fillets are coated with a sweet ginger glaze that complements 
them perfectly. To quickly mince fresh ginger, cut it into one-inch squares and 
remove the peel. Then drop the cubes one by one into a running food processor. 
Let the processor run until all the little flecks of ginger have stopped 
flinging around the work bowl.  
</P>
<P>
 GINGER-GLAZED SALMON FILLETS 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 tablespoons honey 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 6 (6-ounce) salmon fillets, all same thickness, rinsed, patted dry with paper 
towels 
</P>
<P>
 Combine ginger, honey, hoisin sauce, mustard, lemon juice and salt in small 
glass dish. Can be mixed up to 1 day ahead and refrigerated, covered airtight. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrange fillets on foil-lined baking sheet. Coat fillets with glaze, dividing 
evenly. Can be done several hours ahead and refrigerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 450 degrees until almost cooked, about 8 minutes for 1 1/4-inch 
thickness. Broil about 5 inches from heat source until glaze sizzles, about 1 
minute. Serve hot or at room temperature. Makes 6 servings.

</P>
<P>
 As with all stir-fries, this one must be cooked at the last minute so the 
vegetables stay crisp.  
</P>
<P>
 STIR-FRY OF FENNEL, SUGAR SNAP PEAS AND RED PEPPERS WITH SCORCHED RED ONION 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons peanut oil 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons sesame oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 large red onion, cut into thin strips 
</P>
<P>
 2 large trimmed fennel bulbs, cut into thin strips 
</P>
<P>
 2 medium sweet red peppers, cut into thin strips 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 pound sugar snap peas, stem-end trimmed  
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup orange juice 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons seasoned rice vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 Heat peanut and sesame oils in 12-inch non-stick wok or skillet over high 
heat. When very hot, add red onion. Cook, stirring often, until onion is 
scorched on edges, about 2 minutes. Add fennel. Cook 2 more minutes, stirring 
often. Add sweet red peppers, peas, salt and pepper to taste. Stir well to 
combine.  
</P>
<P>
 Cook until peas are heated through but still crispy, about 1 minute. Stir in 
orange juice and vinegar. As soon as mixture is hot, about 10 seconds, remove 
from heat. Adjust seasonings to taste. Serve hot. Makes 6 servings.

<P>
 2 (8-ounce) containers low-fat lemon yogurt  
</P>
<P>
 Zest 1 lemon, removed with fine grater 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons fresh orange juice

</P>
<P>
 1/2 pint fresh raspberries 
</P>

filter and drain about 2 hours, refrigerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine zest and lemon and orange juices in 1 1/2-cup work bowl. Sprinkle 
gelatin over. Let stand until softened. 
</P>
<P>
 In top of double boiler off heat, beat egg yolks and 1/4 cup sugar until thick 
and light-colored. Place pan over -- but not touching -- gently simmering 
water. Cook just until heated through and smooth, stirring constantly. Add 
gelatin mixture, stirring until completely dissolved. Refrigerate until mixture 
begins to thicken but has not gelled, stirring often, about 10 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Whip egg whites with electric mixer at medium speed until foamy. Continue 
beating while slowly adding remaining sugar by tablespoon. Beat until whites 
hold soft, moist peaks. Fold into lemon mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 Gently fold in drained yogurt. There should be about 1 1/2 cups. Spoon mousse 
into 6 clear goblets. Use paper towels to clean smears. Cover each tightly with 
plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight. To serve, spoon pureed 
raspberries over and garnish with fresh raspberries. Makes 6 servings.

HOME COOK: THE CHEESE ALSO RISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARION CUNNINGHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rarely have I eaten a cheese bread I've liked. Usually they have a dubious 
orange color -- and a dubious cheese taste. The following cheese bread recipe, 
however, is wonderful. There is no mistaking the flavor of good Cheddar in this 
loaf. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the ideal bread to go with summer salads. This recipe makes two loaves, 
one to serve within a day or two of baking and the other to freeze for another 
salad, another time. 
</P>
<P>
 A word about salads: A green salad should sparkle and be made of clean, 
chilled, crisp greens. The dressing should be made with fresh oil, a light, 
tingling vinegar or fresh lemon juice, salt, freshly ground pepper, and 
sometimes mustard, herbs and aromatics as accents. We have such a good variety 
of greens and fresh herbs in our produce sections these days there's no excuse 
for monotonous salads. 
</P>
<P>
 Salads should be dressed lightly just before serving. The leaves should shine, 
but not drown in dressing (salad soup is not acceptable). The greens should be 
in bite-size pieces; cutting greens with knife and fork is awkward and never 
feels right. SHARP CHEDDAR CHEESE BREAD 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups warm water 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup instant nonfat dry milk 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 
</P>
<P>
 2 packages dry yeast 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, lightly pressed down 
</P>
<P>
 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 cups flour  
</P>
<P>
 In large mixing bowl stir together water, dry milk, sugar, salt and yeast. Let 
stand to dissolve, about 1 minute. Add cheese and 2 cups of flour. Beat 
vigorously until blended. Add about 2 more cups flour, enough to make dough 
manageable. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Knead 1 to 2 minutes. 
Let stand 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Resume kneading until dough is smooth and elastic, sprinkling on enough 
additional flour to keep it from being too sticky. Place in large greased bowl, 
cover, and let rise until doubled in bulk. Punch dough down and shape into 2

AMERICA'S BEST: GRUMPY JERKY

 We may drink Coca Cola and eat hamburgers and apple pie, but Americans really 
like is beef jerky. Even Sandra Day O'Connor is a fan of the petrified meat.The 
U.S. Supreme Court justice sends her colleagues gift-wrapped packages of 
homemade jerky during the Christmas holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 At Grumpy Bears' Resort, located in Kennedy Meadows (pop. 45), owners Jan and 
Pat Gant make about 400 pounds of intensely flavored beef jerky per week. USDA 
inspectors travel three hours from Bakersfield to the remote mountaintop 
community just to supervise the operation. As if they weren't busy enough, the 
Gants also host barbecues, chili cook-offs and holiday events at their resort.  
</P>
<P>
 The chewy beef jerky, made from hand-sliced and hand-trimmed beef, is 
available in three flavors: regular, hot and teriyaki. A half-pound runs $12; a 
pound costs $23, plus $5 shipping charge per order. There's just one problem: 
There is no electricity or regular telephone service in Kennedy Meadows 
(generators, solar energy and wind provide power and water), so you must either 
order the jerky by mail or call and leave a message. No wonder the bears get 
grumpy. KATHIE JENKINS

NUTS TO YOU, BROTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You were almost right that "Peanut butter was invented in 1880 by a physician 
who wanted a high-protein food for his patients" ("Our Daily Spread," March 
10). That man was Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, medical director of the Battle Creek 
Sanitarium, but his youngest brother, Will Keith Kellogg, actually ground out 
the product in the experimental kitchen of the sanitarium as one of his many 
collateral duties as business manager. Dr. J. H. Kellogg put his name on the 
patent application, just as he did later with flaked cereal products and many 
other inventions of his staff. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1918 until 1926 I lived just across Wood Street from my Uncle "Doc." That 
he was a colorful character, there's no denying. His unvarying uniform was a 
white suit and white shoes, winter and summer. He said white allowed the 
beneficial rays of the sun to penetrate to his skin. With his sulfur-crested 
cockatoo perched on his shoulder, he cut an impressive figure, despite his 
five-foot-four height. Soon you will be able to see a reincarnation of Dr. J. 
H. in the person of Anthony Hopkins in the movie version of "The Road to 
Wellville." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the year that W. K. ground out some roasted peanuts and took the 
resultant product to his brother for approval had to be a bit later than 1880, 
although it was in that decade. W. K. had just returned from a stint in Dallas, 
where he had spent the previous year as manager of a broom company and was not 
yet quite out of his teens. J. H. smelled the peanut concoction, tasted it and 
pronounced it "peanut butter." As W. K. left to return to the kitchen, J. H. 
hastily asked, "How did you cook the peanuts?" To which W. K. responded that he 
had roasted them, of course. J. H. thundered, " Steam them !" over W. K.'s 
futile protests. Steamed peanuts failed to capture the zesty tang of the 
roasted product. That's why peanut butter failed to become a popular item on 
the menu at the sanitarium and only a couple of companies were making it in 
1899.

 It's 10 p.m. I have a pot of beans on the stove I'm cooking your way for the 
first time ("Spilling the Beans," Feb. 24), and I thank you. I've been a bean 
lover for over 40 years now, and I'm so pleased to know they'll taste even 
better. And thank you for the addresses of the specialty bean farms.

 When I first pulled out the Food section, I was really excited to see that 
beans were featured. Beans are one of my favorite foods, so I am always glad to 
find a recipe for them. While the cooking tips you offered were revelatory, the 
recipes were unappealing. There was only one reason for their lack of appeal: 
Almost every recipe contained pork of some form. Only one recipe in the entire 
section did not include pork, but that one was unrelated to your article. I do 
not know one person under 60 who eats pork.

 Splendid article on the bean-soaking question. I have been cooking beans 
without soaking for years, ever since I observed how the Mexicans (and Diana 
Kennedy) did it -- though I go along with the mystique of the ceramic bean pot 
and wooden spoon. 
</P>
<P>
 I missed one vital piece of intelligence in your article, though: Where to get 
epazote. I have been using that herb so long that, like Kennedy, I find it 
unthinkable to cook black beans without it. 
</P>
<P>
 If anyone can turn up sources of supply, fresh or dried, bringing this 
remarkable flavor to public attention would be a service to California cuisine. 
Try it with your next pot of black beans and I think you will agree.

 We have been cooking with cannellini beans, ceci and lentils for the last 60 
years. We have not soaked any beans for the last 40 years. This is the way we 
cook our beans: Rinse beans under cold water, put one pound beans in six-quart 
stainless-steel pot with cold water filled to the top, put on burner on high 
until it boils, then simmer with cover open about one inch. Add salt and 
pepper, one chopped onion, three cloves of garlic, chopped and 1/2 teaspoon 
Italian spices. Every 15 minutes stir the beans with a wooden spoon or plastic 
-- never with a metal spoon. In the meantime, cook one large head of escarole. 
When it's cooked, drain and save the water from the escarole; this is to add to 
the beans as their water cooks down. Put escarole on side. After 1 1/2 hours of 
cooking beans, chop four pieces of celery (with leaves, if possible) and add to 
beans. Continue cooking until beans are soft. Always make sure you keep the pot 
full of broth. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in saucepan put two tablespoons of olive oil, two to three cloves of 
chopped garlic and saute until a light tan. Add the escarole and some broth and 
stir to heat through. Put escarole in a serving dish and top with beans, grated 
Romano or Parmigiano cheese and hot pepper (optional).

 I always read the Food Section of the L.A. Times. Don't know why -- I'm a 
lousy cook. I guess I like to read about what other people go through.I also 
read the restaurant reviews -- just in case I can ever get my husband to eat 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 But I'm especially glad I read Doris Silverton's story, "Lord God King of the 
Universe and President of the Motion Picture Academy" (March 24). It was 
wonderful. I really laughed out loud. Not only is she a wonderful writer, but 
my husband was born in Italy and had old-country parents. In family 
relationships, the Jewish and Italian cultures are so much alike. The story 
brought back many happy and funny memories.

BACK TO BASICS: THE KEY TO GOOD PANCAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Making good pancakes depends on three key factors: mixing the batter to the 
right consistency, heating the griddle properly and recognizing when to turn 
the cakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether making pancake batter from scratch or from a packaged mix, stir it 
just enough to moisten the dry ingredients. The batter should remain lumpy; 
overmixing makes pancakes tough. For best results, cover the batter and 
refrigerate one to two hours so the flour expands and absorbs the moisture. 
</P>
<P>
 To cook the batter, preheat the griddle over medium heat. It's ready when a 
few drops of cold water sizzle and dance when sprinkled onto the surface (Step 
1). If the water just sits and boils, the griddle isn't hot enough; if it 
evaporates instantly, reduce the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Brush the griddle lightly with oil (Step 2) unless it has a non-stick surface 
or is well seasoned. Other types of fat -- shortening, butter or margarine -- 
may be used. 
</P>
<P>
 The easiest way to check the consistency of the batter is to cook a trial 
pancake. Typically, 1/4-cup batter forms a pancake about five inches in 
diameter. Pouring the batter close to the griddle surface (Step 3) helps to 
keep the pancake round, and using a measuring cup assures uniform size. 
</P>
<P>
 Pancakes are ready to turn when bubbles form and begin to break on the upper 
surface and the edges look dry. Turn with a spatula wide enough to accommodate 
the size of the pancake. Normally, the first side needs to cook two to three 
minutes, but the second side will cook in about half that time. Turn the 
pancakes only once. 
</P>
<P>
 The pancake should turn out golden-brown, light and tender and cooked through 
in the center. If the batter is too thick, adjust with a little water; if too 
thin, add a little flour. 
</P>
<P>
 Pancakes are best served at once, either in a stack with syrup or stuffed, 
rolled or glazed with a sauce and then placed under the broiler. BUTTERMILK 
PANCAKES 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 
</P>
<P>
 1 egg 
</P>
<P>
 1 to 1 1/4 cups buttermilk 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons butter, melted 
</P>
<P>
 Syrup, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Combine flour, sugar, salt and baking soda in bowl. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate large bowl, beat egg and blend in 1 cup buttermilk. Add dry 
ingredients to egg mixture and blend until flour disappears. Blend in melted 
butter. Add up to 1/4 cup more buttermilk, if thinner pancakes are desired. 
</P>
<P>
 For each pancake, pour 1/4 cup batter onto hot griddle, lightly greased with 
butter. Cook until edges look dry and bubbles form and begin to break on upper 
surface.  
</P>
<P>
 Turn and cook second side. Serve with syrup. Makes about 14 (3-inch) pancakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Each pancake, without syrup, contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 60 calories; 82 mg sodium; 20 mg cholesterol; 2 grams fat; 8 grams 
carbohydrates; 2 grams protein; 0.02 gram fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 Variations: 
</P>
<P>
 Nut Pancakes -- Stir 1/3 cup chopped nuts into batter. 
</P>
<P>
 Corn Pancakes -- Immediately after pouring batter onto griddle, sprinkle 1 
tablespoon drained whole-kernel corn over each pancake. 
</P>
<P>
 Blueberry Pancakes -- Immediately after pouring batter onto griddle, sprinkle 
1 tablespoon fresh or well-drained canned or frozen blueberries over each 
pancake. 
</P>
<P>
 Banana Pancakes -- Immediately after pouring batter onto griddle, place 2 to 3 
thin banana slices on each pancake.

 Our Indian rice pudding has a pukka (proper) coconut flavor, creamy and rich, 
and you would never guess it contains only a couple of grams of fat.  
</P>
<P>
 But if this recipe had been made with canned coconut milk, each serving would 
contain about 32 grams of fat. 
</P>
<P>
 We cut the fat by using nonfat milk along with nonfat egg substitute and 
coconut extract, to get the flavor and consistency without the high fat. 
Crushed cardamom seeds and golden raisins were added to further enhance the 
flavor, along with a touch of toasted coconut atop each serving for additional 
coconut flavor and crunch. INDIAN RICE PUDDING 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup golden raisins 
</P>
<P>
 1 quart nonfat milk 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup basmati rice 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon crushed cardamom seeds 
</P>
<P>
 Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup nonfat egg substitute (equivalent to 1 egg) 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon coconut extract 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 tablespoons toasted coconut 
</P>
<P>
 Pour 1 cup boiling water over raisins and set aside. Combine nonfat milk, 
rice, sugar, cardamom and salt in large saucepan. Bring to boil. Reduce heat, 
cover and simmer 25 to 35 minutes, until rice is tender. 
</P>
<P>
 Quickly stir egg substitute into rice pudding just until thickened. Stir in 
coconut extract and vanilla. Drain raisins and add to rice mixture. Chill. 
</P>
<P>
 Serve pudding sprinkled with toasted coconut. Makes 6 servings.

 Parky, we hardly knew ye: Forty-two years ago, Lloyd Hutchinson won a citywide 
contest to come up with a cleanup symbol for the Recreation and Parks 
Department. Hutchinson's hard-working kangaroo, Parky, soon began popping up on 
trash cans, billboards and signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "My only compensation was three days for two at Mammoth Lakes -- no 
transportation provided," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 What galls him is that a Parky song contest followed and the winner of that 
competition received a two-week vacation for two in Europe.  
</P>
<P>
 "I just decided to write (to Recreation and Parks) now, but this thing's been 
simmering inside me for years," said Hutchinson, now a Corona resident. "I 
don't think I was adequately compensated." 
</P>
<P>
 He points out that other cities and states subsequently adopted Parky. "My 
sister saw him on a billboard in Kansas," he said. "I've heard reports of him 
in New York on golf courses. He was in San Diego too." 
</P>
<P>
 Al Goldfarb, a Recreation and Parks spokesman, said the city is exploring ways 
to thank Hutchinson. But he added that Parky, who was retired as a symbol here 
more than two decades ago, is no longer politically correct. "I don't think the 
animal rights people would appreciate him having trash in his pouch," Goldfarb 
explained. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Anyone see a trend here?Pepperdine University's Jeff Bliss points out that 
three local law schools -- Southwestern, Loyola and UCLA -- are hosting 
workshops Friday on the same subject: 
</P>
<P>
 Bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, that lightning-quick machinery at City Hall: The City Council on Tuesday 
approved a bill to suspend some noise ordinances and allow around-the-clock 
work on the Santa Monica Freeway to facilitate "the completion of earthquake 
recovery repairs." 
</P>
<P>
 And not a moment too soon, inasmuch as the damaged portion of the freeway is 
scheduled to reopen Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill was supposed to have been drawn up two months ago. Fortunately, the 
work crews, who have been laboring 24 hours a day since soon after the Jan. 17 
earthquake, didn't wait. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city's youngest wheeler-dealer: We mentioned the other day that a 
financial institution sent a letter to Dave Cagle's 1-year-old son, Brian, 
offering to lend him $3,000 "in just two working days." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the lucky Westchester kid has received a letter from Merrill Lynch, 
offering him a "Visa and checking account that provides you with easy, 
unlimited access to your assets," among other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might have to hit Brian up for a loan," said his dad, who is justifiably 
proud.

 How is she going to explain it to the caterer?Darlene Holt of the county 
Department of Animal Care and Control received a call on Wednesday from a woman 
who asked: "Is this the bureau for cat marriage licenses?" 
</P>
<P>
 Holt told her there was no such agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I have a male and a female cat and I was hoping to get them married 
before they breed," the woman lamented. miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
 The director of the Parks and Recreation Department of the city of Rosemead is 
Michael Burbank. What would Parky say?

SCOTT HARRIS: THE PRICE OF EDUCATION AND A TAX REVOLT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 To enter the gymnasium at Burbank High School, home of the battling Bulldogs, 
is to enter a time warp. The graceful high arc of the ceiling calls to mind a 
vintage airplane hangar. The varnished hardwood floor is old but true. 
"Bird's-eye maple," boasts Frank Kallem, the school's athletic director. "It's 
the best floor in the Foothill League." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a friendly place. "Welcome to the DOGHOUSE," shout the bold blue letters 
painted on a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 If this is a doghouse, then the rooms down below, away from public view, might 
be likened to a dog pound. The boys' locker room is so dark and dingy that 
coaches call it "The Dungeon." The lockers are 50 years old, so it's not 
surprising that some doors are missing. The roof on a coach's office nearby 
leaks badly. "Every time we get a half-inch of rain," says Bob Shaw, a business 
teacher and track coach, "we've got a new swimming pool in there." 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that help -- a brand-new school, no less -- is on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Come April 12, the voters of Burbank will decide whether public education, 
under attack from so many quarters, is worth a fresh investment of $100 
million. That's the amount of the bond measure that would enable the Burbank 
Unified School District, which serves 13,000 students, to rebuild the run-down, 
70-year-old Burbank High and modernize several other schools. 
</P>
<P>
 For a modest investment -- $30 to $70 a year for most homeowners -- Burbank 
will have the facilities it needs to guide its children into the 21st Century. 
The way it is now, Burbank High doesn't even have the electrical system it 
needs to provide proper air conditioning for computers and other high-tech 
equipment. The way it is now, patching the roof and fixing the plumbing is just 
throwing good money after bad. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the argument you'll hear from school board President Elena Hubbell and 
just about every civic leader in town. Hubbell says she's optimistic the 
measure will receive the two-thirds vote it needs for passage. 
</P>
<P>
 But, for an optimist, she's campaigning awfully hard, giving the pitch at 
Kiwanis meetings and coffee klatches. So far, she's encouraged but not yet 
confident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm feeling this is a do-or-die situation," says Hubbell. "We don't have 
alternatives. We don't have another source of funding." 
</P>
<P>
 There are several reasons why supporters are worried. They are well aware that 
some people hold public education, no matter where, in contempt. And there is 
always a camp of people who just say no to taxes -- especially property taxes, 
the evil at the root of Proposition 13, the epic tax revolt that began in the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell, for example, could not have felt comforted by a commentary that 
appeared Tuesday in The Times. In it, Joel Fox, president of the Howard Jarvis 
Taxpayers Assn., celebrates Michigan's recent decision to abandon property tax 
as the financing mechanism for schools in favor of increased sales and 
cigarette taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "For residential property owners, the property tax is nothing more than a tax 
to be paid out of their incomes -- but not based on their incomes," Fox writes. 
"As home values increase and earning power remains flat, the onerous aspects of 
the property tax become obvious . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Proposition 13 itself," he goes on, "is just a step on the evolutionary path 
of curtailing and perhaps eventually eliminating the property tax." He goes on 
to assert that "clearly the trend is toward diminished importance of the 
property tax. At most, the tax will end as a tax on property-related services." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless you're a policy wonk, debates over sales versus property taxes can be 
tedious. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing missing from Fox's argument is something that every homeowner knows: 
The value of your home is directly related to the quality of your local 
schools. Doesn't it make sense, then, that property taxes be used to support 
schools? An investment in your community is an investment in your own home. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell thinks so -- and not just because she's the school board president. 
</P>
<P>
 She's also a realtor. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Walk down the dimly lit hallways of Burbank High and you get the impression of 
a campus that is thriving despite itself. The rah-rah spirit can be seen in 
posters painted by students: "Burbank Is Awesome." "Burbank Power Is All We 
Need." "Nothing But Dogs!" 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, test scores in the district have slipped. But it's not like the old days 
when just about everybody spoke English at home. Now students are as apt to 
enter school speaking only Spanish or Armenian or Chinese or. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But so what? 
</P>
<P>
 If they go to Burbank High, it's like the sign says: Nothing but dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 They just need a new kennel.

THE MESSENGERS ARE SENDING WRONG SIGNALS TO L.A.; VIOLENCE: THE MEDIA MUST STOP 
INJECTING RACIAL OVERTONES INTO EVERY SHOOTING INCIDENT INVOLVING A STORE 
OWNER. 
</P>

By EDWARD TAEHAN CHANG and ANGELA EUNJIN OH, Edward Taehan Chang is assistant 
professor of ethnic studies at UC Riverside. Angela Eunjin Oh is a criminal 
defense attorney in Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, we are reminded of the formidable challenge Los Angeles faces in 
its struggle toward revitalization. The television and radio coverage of the 
tragic shooting of a 14-year-old boy by a storekeeper in Lynwood suggests a 
haunting affirmation of our worst fear: that we can never overcome the racial 
divide among us. 
</P>
<P>
 While there are innumerable stories and viewpoints that could be covered in 
connection with the incident, the only clear theme that consistently emerges in 
television and radio coverage is that of racial and ethnic tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than focusing on the fact that the city has been ravaged by crisis 
after crisis affecting all of those who live here, we are being led to believe 
that the real story underlying the shooting incident is racial and ethnic 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than recognizing that all of our efforts to "rebuild" Los Angeles have 
been thwarted by a declining economy, insufficient resources to assist disaster 
victims and a strong public cynicism about our political process, we are being 
asked to focus on the racial and ethnic difference between a Latino teen-ager 
and a Korean shopkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 While many of our leaders have committed themselves to the difficult task of 
forging multiracial and multicultural partnerships, they are rarely given the 
ability to affirm and reaffirm the need for that vision to be realized if we 
are to survive as a community. Instead, what leads the news is the "news" of 
strategies brewing to pit one ethnic group against another. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than turning our attention to the messages in our society that lead our 
youth to take risks that endanger lives, we find ourselves engaged in the 
ludicrous position of justifying conduct that is unwanted and unacceptable to 
all of us. Theft -- even petty theft -- is wrong. Using a gun to stop a 
teen-ager from stealing food is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than keeping abreast of the organizing among diverse communities 
seeking to keep dialogue open in the midst of long-standing resentment, bigotry 
and fear, we are fed gratuitous images of the shooting of Latasha Harlins. The 
tragic similarity between both incidents is clear. But for Korean American 
shopkeepers, the predicament in which Michael Kim found himself last Saturday 
is also too familiar. Unfortunately, the victimization of small-business owners 
like Kim rarely get reported in the media -- more than 35 Korean American 
small-business people in Southern California shot dead or wounded in the past 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 It is very probable that neither the 14-year-old nor Kim understands the way 
in which he has become a pawn in this dangerous game of manipulation. It is no 
secret that television and radio play a powerful role in shaping public 
opinion. In continuing to suggest that this incident is about race, a lack of 
respect for other cultures or some other distortion about the conditions under 
which small businesses in our city operate, the "news" is simply wrong.

COCAINE FOUND IN MOUTHS OF HORSES AT ILLINOIS TRACKS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Illinois Racing board has ordered mandatory pre-race saliva tests for all 
horses at Illinois tracks because traces of cocaine were found in the mouths of 
32 racehorses. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also have ordered the suspension and fine of several thoroughbred 
trainers and four harness trainers because cocaine was detected in horses they 
handled.At least nine other harness trainers were fined $500 each, said racing 
board executive director Joseph Sinopoli. 
</P>
<P>
 The net widened Wednesday when stewards at Sportsman's Park handed out fines 
to four owner-trainers and suspended three. 
</P>
<P>
 Jere Smith Jr., Alan Crocker and Gerald Butler were each fined $500 and 
suspended for 30 days, the stewards said. The fourth owner-trainer, Michael 
Tammaro, was fined $500. 
</P>
<P>
 The stimulant was discovered during spot checks of the horses' tongue ties.

 Japanese Official Sees End of Recession: In the most authoritative official 
statement yet that Japan's economic outlook is improving, Bank of Japan 
Governor Yasushi Mieno said Japan's worst postwar recession appears to be 
drawing to a close."The economy is brighter," Mieno said after conclusion of a 
three-day conference of the bank's branch managers. Participants in the meeting 
confirmed evidence of improved corporate sentiment and recovery in personal 
consumption, he said. Mieno warned, however, that the economy is still in the 
process of bottoming out and that a quick recovery is not assured. He cited the 
strong yen and trade frictions as factors that could cut off any recovery.

WESTSIDE WATCH: UCLA'S REDWOODS WON'T BE DEADWOOD AFTER ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A tree still grows on Stone Canyon Drive. In fact, several trees do, and will 
continue to do so now that UCLA has reconsidered its plan to cut several down 
to widen the street.  
</P>
<P>
 The university won't say it, but two homeowners associations believe the buzz 
they made about the plan led to the decision to halt the chop job, which would 
have felled several large, old coast redwoods and California sycamores near the 
intersection with Sunset Boulevard. The trees, neighbors said, muffle noise and 
add beauty to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.5-million project would have included the widening of Stone Canyon 
Drive near the Sunset Boulevard intersection, construction of a median and 
installation of a stoplight. Engineers were expecting an increase in traffic 
after new buildings and parking lots are completed by spring, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The university had tried to ease tensions by reducing the number of trees to 
be felled from 21 to 18, then to five. Officials also proposed adding 15 new 
trees. But the neighbors balked at those ideas and earlier proposals to replant 
the trees on campus (it wasn't certain the trees would survive). 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think it's necessary to remove any trees," said Sandy Brown, 
president of the Holmby-Westwood Property Owners Assn., which along with the 
Westwood Hills Homeowners Assn. mobilized against the project when it came to 
light three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus architect Charles Oakley said this week that although plans are not 
final, it appears the project can be completed without removing the trees or 
building the median, which some residents deemed dangerous. The new plan awaits 
the approval of the city Department of Transportation. 
</P>

 LAST CHANCE: If you're a Beverly Hills or Culver City voter who has tuned out 
your municipal races, there's still time to look over the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cities, candidates forums are being offered so voters can see their 
would-be leaders in action at least once before Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beverly Hills, the League of Women Voters is sponsoring a live television 
call-in show tonight in which residents will be able to question the candidates 
from 7 to 9:30 p.m. The program, to air on BHTV Channel 3, is moderated by 
former Mayor Charles Aronberg. Residents may call (310) 284-8012. 
</P>
<P>
 In Culver City, voters can see politicians make their pitch at one of two 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Culver City Chamber of Commerce has scheduled a candidates forum for noon 
Friday, during the chamber's monthly luncheon at the Red Lion Hotel, 6161 W. 
Centinela Ave. For reservations call (310) 287-3850. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Heather Village Condominium Assn. will hold a candidates forum 
and champagne brunch Sunday, from noon to 3 p.m., at 6443 Green Valley Circle, 
in Fox Hills. For information call (310) 649-0247 or (310) 649-3611.

ELECTIONS THAT ARE POLLS APART; RACE HEATS UP IN BEVERLY HILLS, GROWTH ISSUE 
DOMINATES IN MALIBU, IT'S QUIET IN WEST HOLLYWOOD AND A SPIRITED CONTEST IN 
CULVER CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ken Ellingwood, This story was reported by G. Jeanette Avent, Carol 
Chastang, Ken Ellingwood and Kathleen Kelleher. It was written by Ellingwood. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Voters go to the polls in four Westside cities Tuesday to settle municipal 
races ranging from low-key to loud. 
</P>
<P>
 Culminating a quiet campaign, progressive West Hollywood could elect its first 
gay City Council majority in eight years. Malibu council candidates, meanwhile, 
have been debating -- for the most part politely -- how to retain what's left 
of that city's pastoral calm. 
</P>
<P>
 But in crime-conscious Beverly Hills, a former New York prosecutor has drawn 
fire from a police union as he tries to hold his council seat. And in Culver 
City, an unexpectedly spirited city clerk's race centers on just how 
professional -- and well-paid -- the clerk's job should be. Beverly Hills 
</P>
<P>
 The most in-your-face campaign is taking place in Beverly Hills, where 
incumbent Councilman Robert K. Tanenbaum, the top vote-getter in two previous 
elections, is trying to stave off what may be his first serious challenge. The 
threats come from a committee whose sole purpose is to defeat him and from the 
city's police union. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanenbaum, armed with $41,000 in campaign funds and an eight-year track 
record, is one of eight candidates competing for two seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Although few expect Tanenbaum to fall, he faces a determined group of 
detractors who previously tried to unseat him as president of the board of 
directors of the Beverly Hills Family Y. Now they hope to oust him from his 
council seat. The group had raised $6,100 for the effort -- most of it from 
outgoing Mayor Maxwell Salter. 
</P>
<P>
 Salter, who declined to seek a third term, has accused Tanenbaum, a lawyer, of 
glossing over a deficit at the Y, which since 1987 has received about $226,000 
in city grants. Tanenbaum has responded that charities have been very hard-hit 
by the recession and called it "almost miraculous" that the Y even stayed open. 
</P>
<P>
 Unwilling to let the issue rest until June, when the city reviews its grants 
to community groups, some former Y members and current board member Roger Cowan 
formed a campaign committee going beyond the Y issue to oppose Tanenbaum's 
council bid. Cowan's wife, Debra, who is the group's treasurer, says: "The Y 
was simply a galvanizing issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The group mailed out a letter last week from Beverly Hills Police Officers 
Assn. President Joseph Chirillo that was notable not so much for its 
endorsement of candidates MeraLee Goldman and Les Bronte as for its strong 
denunciation of Tanenbaum. 
</P>
<P>
 The union, which represents the city's 128 police officers and usually backs 
incumbents, faults Tanenbaum for representing Sylvester Stallone after the 
actor became the subject of a Beverly Hills police investigation in April, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallone had been accused in West Hollywood of assaulting a photographer 
during a car chase that began in West Hollywood and ended in Beverly Hills, but 
the Los Angeles County district attorney never filed charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanenbaum denies any impropriety, saying he obtained an opinion from the 
Beverly Hills city attorney assuring him that it would not be a conflict of 
interest to represent Stallone while on the council. Tanenbaum says that he is 
dismayed that "during the heat of a political campaign, the (association) sees 
fit to play politics with people's lives and misrepresent past events to fit 
political agendas." 
</P>
<P>
 The former prosecutor has also angered the police union for campaign remarks 
that the union says belittled the department. Tanenbaum, the only candidate who 
opposes hiring more police, urged that the city "not add more police desk 
jockeys in suits," suggesting instead that the department put more of its 
existing personnel on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanenbaum is so controversial that the other candidates have trouble getting 
any attention. However, Goldman, a former planning commissioner, Bronte, a 
former Chamber of Commerce president, and Alan Robert Block, a city schools' 
activist, have all raised sums of money comparable to the $41,432 raised by 
Tanenbaum. They and the rest of the candidates in the race -- Mary Levin 
Cutler, Bernard J. Hecht, Trisha Roth and Herm Shultz -- all have agreed not to 
exceed a $60,000 limit set by the League of Women Voters. Malibu 
</P>
<P>
 In Malibu, where two City Council seats are being contested, incumbents Walt 
Keller and John Harlow face four challengers in a decidedly tame campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout, the talk has been of how to control growth -- a topic as dominant 
now as in the 1991 cityhood election and 1992 council race. Nearly every public 
forum has been dominated by debate of the draft general plan, the final version 
of which will guide the city's overall development and will be presented for 
public comment in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Keller, who received the most votes in Malibu's 1991 cityhood election, and 
challenger Tom Hasse are running on a slow-growth platform and have been 
endorsed by Mayor Carolyn Van Horn and anti-growth activists. They believe the 
draft general plan provides adequate -- and not overly restrictive -- 
restraints on the ability of single-family homeowners to develop their 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Harlow and challengers Jeff Jennings, both of whom were endorsed 
by Supervisor Ed Edelman along with Keller, fear that the draft plan is far too 
restrictive to single-family homeowners -- and may, they say, adversely affect 
property values. Candidates Louis Ragsdale and Robert Stratman have voiced the 
same concerns over the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear how much weight such objections would carry on the five-member 
council, however, because the three council members not up for election -- Van 
Horn, Mayor Pro Tem Jeff Kramer and Joann House appear to favor a more 
restrictive general plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is scheduled to adopt a general plan in November. Public hearings 
on the draft plan are scheduled to start next month. Culver City 
</P>
<P>
 In Culver City, voters will elect two candidates to the City Council, but the 
real drama has been in the race for the city clerk's post. The contest has 
pitted a longtime incumbent against an activist seeking his first elected 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 The key issue is pay. Incumbent Clerk Pauline Dolce wants to keep her 
$75,000-a-year salary. Her opponent, Tom Crunk, supports a recent City Council 
decision to slash the salary to $732 a month, or about $9,000 a year. The 
council action would take effect in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Crunk, the first person to challenge Dolce in her 16-year tenure, says he 
would not wait until 1996 for the pay cut. He compares the clerk position to 
that of a part-time elected official, and considers the $75,000 salary 
unreasonably high. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolce says the clerk's job requires a full-time professional to oversee 
elections, prepare meeting agendas, supervise the city's accounting division 
and pay the city's bills. A separate ballot measure before Culver City voters 
would shift accounting duties to the city treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 The council race, meanwhile, centers on development issues. 
</P>
<P>
 While incumbent Mike Balkman points to progress in major downtown 
redevelopment, the challengers have said that the city is not doing enough to 
encourage business. Two of the candidates -- Jim Hilfenhaus and Richard Marcus 
-- say Balkman has broken his promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Balkman) had said he would do his best to lower taxes," Marcus said. "But he 
proposed an 11% utility tax on cellular phones. . . . How do you encourage 
business by levying one more tax?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hilfenhaus criticized the council's approval of the controversial Marina Place 
retail mall, an 18-acre lot that has yet to be developed. Hilfenhaus said he 
would hold more public meetings to solicit residents' opinions of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenger Ed Wolkowitz, a member of the Planning Commission, has attacked a 
proposal to have the city take over Southern California Edison's Culver City 
operations. Such actions, he said, give the city a bad reputation in business 
circles. West Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates are not talking about what might be the most interesting 
feature of an otherwise lackluster West Hollywood City Council race. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, whose population is about one-third gay and lesbian, would have a 
gay council majority with a sweep of the three seats available. Gays have not 
dominated the council since 1986. Incumbent John Heilman, who is seeking 
reelection, is the council's only openly gay member. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine of the 10 active candidates are gay, but there has been almost no talk of 
gay and lesbian issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 With so many gay candidates, there is little political gain in emphasizing gay 
issues. A local cause with strong appeal to many gay voters -- the creation of 
a city police force -- is opposed by most of the council candidates. Candidates 
still worry about alienating heterosexual voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no such thing as a gay and lesbian parking problem," says Steve 
Martin, a gay rights activist and rent commissioner who lost his last council 
bid in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Most candidates end the race as they began -- emphasizing public safety above 
all other issues. The only other incumbent, Sal Guarriello, has played up his 
role as a fiscal watchdog. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's key political endorsement, from the renters rights group Coalition 
for Economic Survival, went to Heilman and running mate Jeff Richmond, who 
heads the Planning Commission. Even though three seats are up for election, the 
group did not endorse a third candidate. Campaign Cash

COMMUNITY NEWS: RANCHO PARK; GUARD DIES OF WOUNDS FROM BANK ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A gunman fatally wounded a security guard last week during a robbery at the 
California Federal Bank on Pico Boulevard, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman fled after the 12:42 p.m. robbery Friday at 10680 W. Pico Blvd., 
FBI spokesman Ron Twersky said. The guard, who was wounded in the chest, died 
Friday at Century City Hospital, Twersky said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman entered the bank, confronted two tellers and demanded an 
undisclosed amount of money, Twersky said. He fled to the front of the bank, 
where he confronted the guard and shot him before leaving.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WEST HOLLYWOOD; COUNCIL OKS COMPLEX FOR LOW-INCOME AIDS 
PATIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Actresses Lynn Redgrave and Jean Stapleton played to a packed house in West 
Hollywood on Monday -- supporting a housing development for people with AIDS 
that was opposed by neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every one of us here is just somebody's child," said Redgrave, a trustee of 
the Actors' Fund of America charity and a resident of Topanga Canyon. "And 
every person stricken with AIDS is also just somebody's child." 
</P>
<P>
 Redgrave left before the City Council voted, 5 to 0, to reject the appeals of 
neighbors who charged that the housing development would block views and 
increase traffic on busy Palm Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents praised the idea of an AIDS complex but said the proposed project 
was too big for the site and warned that the hilly street would be difficult 
for tenants to walk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not that it isn't righteous, and not that it isn't the thing to do," opponent 
Matt Gatson said. "This is not a good place to put this." 
</P>
<P>
 The 40-unit complex, which will cost $5.3 million in land and construction, 
would be the second in West Hollywood for low-income residents who have AIDS. 
The developer, the West Hollywood Community Housing Corp., built a similar 
22-unit apartment complex on Harper Avenue two years ago. Both developments are 
funded through private investments and below-market loans from city and state 
housing programs. The housing corporation also plans to borrow about $1 million 
from the Actors' Fund for the Palm Avenue project. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of an 11-unit apartment complex will be torn down to make room for the 
new four-story facility, which will house up to 51 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The one- and two-bedroom apartment units will cost $370 to $500 a month to 
rent. Backers said the need for such affordable housing is dire among people 
with AIDS, many of whom cannot work to pay rent but are well enough to live on 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Dwiggins, who lives in the Harper Avenue complex, said the $315 
monthly rent takes nearly half his monthly income. But he said it is cheaper 
than elsewhere and allows him to stay active as a volunteer for an AIDS 
education group. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, with one of the highest AIDS rates in the nation, has long supported 
AIDS programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have said this isn't about AIDS," said Councilman John Heilman. "It is 
about AIDS. It's about the tremendous need" for AIDS housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said after the vote that they were discussing whether to launch a 
legal challenge, but had made no decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhood opponents appealed to the council after the project was approved 
by the city's Planning Commission. Some snags were resolved in negotiations 
mediated by Heilman and Mayor Sal Guarriello. Housing corporation officials 
agreed to lower the height of the roof by three feet to protect neighbors' 
views, and provide more room for vehicles to turn around to prevent traffic 
congestion on the street. Tenants will not be eligible for city permits to park 
on the street there.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW; CARPENTERS ON THRIFTY PROJECT FILE SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A partnership between a Long Beach general contractor and four 
South-Central-based contractors that was heralded as a trailblazing 
collaboration in post-riot Los Angeles has disintegrated into acrimony. 
</P>
<P>
 The Collins Group, four contractors who are members of the Black Carpenters 
Assn., has filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court alleging that Har-Bro 
Inc. misled them about how much profit they would receive for helping rebuild a 
Thrifty drugstore at Crenshaw Boulevard and Rodeo Place that burned in the 1992 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the recently filed lawsuit, Rod White, William Collins, Jake 
Bellamy and Michael Matthews received only $34,000 instead of the roughly 
$300,000 in profits they were expecting. 
</P>
<P>
 Har-Bro attorney Paul Nankivell said the company also expected to make more 
money, but that job delays and unexpected construction costs deflated profits 
to next to nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The total cost is still being ironed out, but we just didn't make the money 
the Collins Group assumed we would make," Nankivell said. "Being unfamiliar 
with large construction jobs, I think they had unreal expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership received national media attention after Thrifty awarded the 
$1.3-million contract to the joint venture in January, 1993. Har-Bro approached 
the Black Carpenters Assn. about forming the partnership after Thrifty 
stipulated that 50% of the subcontractors and work force had to be members of 
minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
 White said the partnership with Har-Bro seemed too good to be true. Finally, 
said White, here was a chance to employ sizable numbers of black workers on a 
job in the community. It seemed like an opportunity to redress a longstanding 
complaint of employment exclusion that blacks and other minorities frequently 
have leveled at commercial builders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were the adolescents, and they (Har-Bro) were the mentors, but we were 
deceived," White said. "We did all the work on the project but aren't reaping 
any benefits. We did everything in good faith because we were so anxious to do 
the job, help our people." 
</P>
<P>
 The Collins Group paid 17 subcontractors, nearly all members of the Black 
Carpenters Assn., to finish the work over 10 months. The Collins Group received 
the $34,000 in increments over that time in addition to money for materials and 
labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides say that tensions increased in the partnership over the course of 
construction, which began in February, 1993, and ended in November. Nankivell 
said Har-Bro was not satisfied with the work of some subcontractors, and delays 
set in as work had to be redone or new workers hired. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins Group members say Har-Bro fired some subcontractors unnecessarily in 
the middle of jobs and brought in cheaper, mostly Latino workers to finish up. 
Har-Bro filed bonds against two subcontractors, leading to the suspension of 
their state licenses and forcing one out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the problems, Bellamy said he and his partners were determined to 
finish the job, the largest one the association had ever been awarded. 
Association attorney David Ganezer accused Har-Bro of exploiting that desire. 
"It was like, 'We got good press from getting black partners and black 
subcontractors, so we can get rid of these guys,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nankivell called the allegations "unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 "Har-Bro is an open book," he said. "I've told them many times they're welcome 
to do an audit." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: LEIMERT PARK; THEATER PLAYS HOST TO BLACK TV COMEDY AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The cable channel Black Entertainment Television held its first Comicview 
awards show last week at the Vision Complex Theater, drawing legions of 
celebrities and marking the first time the theater has played host to a 
televised event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marla Gibbs' theater is great, and it's great that BET chose to have the 
awards here," said soul singer Vesta, who hosted the show.About 300 musicians, 
stand-up comics and fans packed the Vision auditorium, which was refurbished in 
Art Deco style for last August's Los Angeles Festival. Awards presenters, hosts 
and attendees included comedian Lawanda Page, TV actors Darryl Sivad ("Roc") 
and T'Keyah Crystal Keymah ("In Living Color") and comedian Richard Pryor. 
</P>
<P>
 The awards show was a culmination of BET's second season of "Comicview," a 
weekly series that showcases up-and-coming comedians taped live at the 
Normandie Casino in Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
 Awards went to Dante (best impressionist, best music comedy, most cutting 
edge), Lovell Crawford (rising star), Amazing Grace (best impersonation) and 
Just June (best female comic). Each of the eight finalists competed to star in 
their own half-hour "Grandstand Comedy Jam" on BET. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest honor, the Richard Pryor Award, went to comic Cedric the 
Entertainer. Pryor's sharp, socially observant material in the 1970s influenced 
a generation of black comedians, including those who performed excerpts of 
their routines during the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Actress Gibbs' complex, which housed both the awards and a party after the 
show, also received kudos. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great beginning for the awards show and for other productions," 
Cedric the Entertainer said. "It's special that it took place right here in the 
community." ERIN J. AUBRY

WHALES: THE NEED FOR THE HUMAN TOUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As to the person putting the captions on the pictures for your article on 
whales (April 24), "Exhibiting the Human Touch," they should have read the 
article first. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture on pages 12 and 13 is captioned, "A whale nuzzles up to a boat and 
the outstretched hands of humans.During mating season off Baja, whales enjoy 
the contact." During mating season you risk getting capsized (or getting hit by 
a 10-foot-long penis) if you are near the whales. It should have read, "During 
nursing season. . . ." All the adult gray whale males have long since departed 
the lagoons for their migration north while the mothers nurse their young. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than the above, I congratulate your staff for an excellent article.

SENIORS: NEW PARENTS WELCOME HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a father, I found Linda Feldman's "For Seniors" column ("Grandma' Puts 
Things Into Perspective," March 27) very sad. While I admire her contentment 
and her compliance with her daughter's wish that she stay away for two weeks 
after the birth of her first grandchild, why would this be the desire? How sad 
that young men tell her, "The worst thing was having my mother-in-law with us. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
 I was very happy to have my mother-in-law, Anne Rubin, stay with us and help 
after each of our children was born.She did not rush in and take over; she 
offered assistance where needed and wanted. She shares her views but never 
makes unreasonable demands or engages in excessive criticism. Generally, she 
helped take care of the new mother, while we took care of the baby and made 
arrangements for the Bris with more than 80 guests. Certainly, I never felt 
like "an alien in my own home." My mother-in-law was and remains welcome in our 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 How sad that some new parents have to exclude the new grandparents for weeks 
at a time! I am very glad that my children had the opportunity to start 
building a relationship with their grandparents from Day One, when I invited 
their grandmother to wheel Rachel and the baby out of the hospital, and she 
did.

MT. OLIVE: THEFT OF EASTER BREAKFAST FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am writing this letter out of anger and frustration and addressing it to the 
individuals that broke into Mt. Olive Lutheran Church March 25 and stole $500 
from our Easter Pancake Breakfast for Mt.Olive Preschool. I want to make sure 
you know who you took the money from and how much it meant to us. 
</P>
<P>
 Mt. Olive is a nonprofit preschool and day-care center. It serves 200 families 
in the Santa Monica/Westside area. For 20 years, it has provided high-quality 
programs at an affordable cost to children ages 2-7 years old. Mt. Olive's 
staff has a genuinely caring and nurturing nature. They are what truly make it 
an excellent school. 
</P>
<P>
 The money we raise from the Easter breakfast assists us in updating aging 
facilities, purchasing play equipment and educational toys for our classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Our only hope is that you truly needed the money more than our children did. 
That stolen money represented a lot of hard work on the part of our parent 
volunteers. It was difficult to serve breakfast Saturday morning, as we knew 
all our effort was in vain. Our expenses would not be recovered. Our breakfast 
was not raising funds for the school. Instead we were explaining to our 3- and 
4-year-olds why the police had come to take fingerprints, and why someone would 
steal from the school. 
</P>
<P>
 What should have been a fun-filled memory of an Easter tradition for our kids, 
turned out to be a reminder that there are some really bad people in this 
world.

COVER STORY; STRENGTH IN NUMBERS; WHY DID FOURTH-GRADERS AT ONE SCHOOL DO SO 
WELL IN MATH ON THE STATE TEST? THE ANSWER MAY LIE IN CREATIVE TEACHING AND 
CONTROVERSIAL GROUPING BASED ON ABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Take the numbers 523 and 651. Which one is divisible by 3? Easy. Add up the 
digits. Five plus 2 plus 3 equals 10. Does 3 go into 10? No way. Six plus 5 
plus 1? 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes! Yes! Yes! The fourth-graders at Horace Mann School in Beverly Hills hiss 
their satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Ellen Morehead does not let up, filling their math hour and much of 
the school day with mind-stretching exercises designed to help them get beyond 
just finding the right answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to make sure your brain doesn't get lazy on us over vacation," 
she told the class the day before they left for spring break last week. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the sort of teaching that helped last year's fourth-graders at Horace 
Mann score among the highest in their age group in Los Angeles County on the 
new statewide California Learning Assessment System, a comprehensive test known 
as CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 Although state authorities decline to cite any one indicator for ranking 
schools by their CLAS results, the figures show that of all the schools in the 
county, Horace Mann had the highest percentage of students in the top three 
scores and the lowest percentage in the bottom three scores. 
</P>
<P>
 The scores were announced last month to the dismay of almost everyone in the 
county except Horace Mann, which serves a neighborhood of modest homes and 
apartments in the southeast corner of Beverly Hills, where about a third of the 
residents do not speak English at home, according to census data. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's 84 fourth-graders will face the CLAS challenge next month, but 
Morehead and her two fourth-grade colleagues said they do not believe the 
results of the test, which was given for the first time in 1993, were a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's performance, they and others maintain, is due to the approach 
Horace Mann takes to teaching math, a strategy that emphasizes analytical 
thinking and, despite some controversy, groups students by ability. It is an 
approach that had other districts calling the school for tips after the test 
results were announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as I've taught, I've taught this way," said Morehead, who has been at 
Horace Mann for her entire career. Now that state experts who wrote the test 
are looking for evidence of the skills that she has been teaching for 25 years, 
"we're ahead of the game," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS test replaced multiple-choice exams that did not take into account 
how students arrived at their answers. Students now must explain some of their 
answers, with points assigned not just for correct responses but also for 
evidence of understanding basic principles and being able to explain how they 
arrived at the solutions. Students in grades four, eight and 10 were tested in 
reading, writing and math. 
</P>
<P>
 Students were given scores of 1 to 6, with 1 meaning little or no grasp of 
mathematical ideas and 6 -- a score experts say is virtually impossible to 
attain -- showing deep understanding of the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Morehead said she and her colleagues, who have been working as a team for five 
years, were most proud of the low number of 1s reported for Horace Mann. Only 
2% of their fourth-graders tested scored that low, compared to totals ranging 
from 12% to 26% at the three other elementary schools in the Beverly Hills 
district, 44% countywide, and 38% statewide. On the higher end, 49% of Horace 
Mann students received scores of 4 and up, compared to a district average of 
25% and a county average of 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 How did they do so well? At Horace Mann, Morehead said, instruction goes 
beyond the basics to probe the why behind mathematical ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our philosophy is instilling the basics. That's crucial," said Morehead, who 
starts by working with colleagues Rachael Zanka and Lynn Koff and lower-grade 
teachers to drum the standard arithmetic curriculum into their kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they understand that, it's our goal for them to be able to explain the 
why of any problem we present to them, whether it's how many triangles I can 
get out of a hexagon, or how many different ways there are to make change for a 
dollar," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers had to overcome the objections of some parents who did not want 
their children sorted into groups by ability for the one-hour daily math 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers say that pupils also tackle math at other times during the day, 
when they work together, regardless of skill level. 
</P>
<P>
 But parents of about a dozen students, some of whom have since opted for 
private schools, do not buy that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The math tracking was a very big reason why I left. Many brilliant children 
were put into the low group and made to feel very stupid," said Rosanna Grabel, 
whose son was put in the low group. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids in the low group think they're bad in math, and it's a stigma that 
sticks with them all their lives," added Deborah Mehrez, whose son was put in 
the middle group despite scoring high on another statewide math test. She has 
since placed her son in private school. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents were also upset at the blow to self-esteem caused by a field trip 
that the high group took to the Pacific Stock Exchange. The others stayed at 
school to watch a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way people feel about themselves, not just the top of the barrel, is the 
most important thing," said Mehrez, a former PTA president. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Morehead acknowledges that the field trip was "a big mistake," she, 
Koff and Zanka defended grouping. They said it brings them as close as they can 
get to having one teacher per student. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Kraushaar, president of the Horace Mann PTA and the mother of a 
fourth-grader, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever did disapprove of it, they have to see now that it works," she said. 
"By putting kids in different levels, you can still have kids achieving high in 
lower levels." 
</P>
<P>
 Although her daughter is in the high group, she said, "I see it working for 
her friends too, so we're very happy with it." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 During class, students may work on problems at their desks, sit in small 
groups on the floor, talk among themselves about such things as place value, 
integers and quotients, or play a strategy game on a graph projected on the 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Homework often includes puzzlers such as this one: A waiter divides a round 
pizza pie into eight equal slices with only three straight cuts of a knife. How 
did he do it? 
</P>
<P>
 Think about it. Now let's talk to some fourth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Klein, 10, came to Horace Mann in January, transferring from another 
Beverly Hills school where pupils were not grouped by math ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "There, they were always teaching out of a book," he said. "The smarter people 
were really bored because they had to wait for the not really fast people." 
</P>
<P>
 Micah Amado, 9, said, "The people that are really strong go to a math class 
that's really hot. It's better, 'cause the math book is really dull." 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Abraham, 10, added, "If we need help, then all of us (on the same 
ability level) need help at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 And Sogol Simino, 10, said, "They don't just want answers. They want you to 
explain the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, who's ready for pizza? Here's the answer: The waiter makes one cut across 
the diameter, creating two equal halves, and another at right angles, yielding 
four pieces. He then stacks them up in a pile and slashes down the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 This puzzle came from a logic book designed for fifth- to eighth-graders, 
something that the teachers scrambled to find, along with problem sheets and 
educational toys, since most arithmetic texts do not reflect their approach to 
teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Supt. Sol Levine was careful to note that other Beverly Hills schools 
did well in the reading and writing portions of the CLAS test, he said Horace 
Mann's success in the math exam will be held up as a model. 
</P>
<P>
 "In large measure, (Mann's success) is due to the work of the teachers, and to 
the fact that the exam does test thinking skills, the ability to explain why 
certain things are done in math, and the teachers involved use those approaches 
along with teaching the basics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not inflexible. It's a process where they try to identify where the 
children are, and to work with the children at that particular point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers, too, stress the flexibility of their approach, which allows 
students to change levels easily as they improve skills. 
</P>
<P>
 It also allows children to ask questions without fear of setting off scornful 
laughter from their peers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not afraid to ask questions, because it's probably on the minds of 
several kids in that group," Koff said. 
</P>
<P>
 It also makes it easier for teachers to pay attention to the children at the 
top and bottom of their classes, extremes that are often neglected when 
teaching everybody at once. At Horace Mann, the middle and top groups are a 
little larger, so there is more time per pupil in the lower section. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, teachers like to teach the brighter kids," said school board 
President Lillian Raffel. "If we did that all the time, it would be a disaster 
politically, and demoralizing to the other kids." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There were a few complaints from parents two years ago, she said, but they 
have since dropped off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe (the teachers) explained it to the parents better," she said. "There's 
always some pressure to jam the high group, and it's unfair to kids to be 
pushed like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Board member A. J. Willmer, whose daughter is in the fifth grade at Horace 
Mann, said the impact of the CLAS results will be immediate districtwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point is to look at all those 3s, 2s and 1s and move them all up," he 
said. "We don't want to compare ourselves to the rest of the L.A. County but to 
ourselves, and to get better." 
</P>
<P>
 Though parents and administrators credit the cadre of veteran teachers at 
Horace Mann, the teachers themselves pointed to the arithmetic basics that 
their children got in earlier grades, and to the support of Principal Arthur E. 
Fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten a lot of calls from different school districts asking what we 
did," Fields said. "My answer is that it depends on your teachers, how good 
they are and how much time they're willing to put in to develop these 
materials." 
</P>
<P>
 Will Horace Mann repeat its math success on this year's CLAS? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of pressure," said one of the three teachers. "Don't you dare 
quote me (by name), but I lie awake at night wondering if it was a fluke. I 
don't think it was." Head of the Class

REGIONAL REPORT; SIGNS OF LIFE IN FIRE ZONES; AREAS BLACKENED BY LAST FALL'S 
BLAZES ARE SUDDENLY BLOOMING WITH WILDFLOWERS AND BRIGHT GREEN GRASSES. THE 
RAPID GROWTH SURPRISES MANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five months ago, several thousand acres in Los Angeles and Ventura counties 
were just blackened remains and ash-covered ground. But nature is moving 
swiftly, and now wildflowers and bright green grasses are taking over, turning 
the mess from the November wildfires into thriving meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 Deep in Aliso Canyon, which the 26,500-acre Santa Paula fire raced through on 
its way toward Ventura, burnt stumps and fallen trees still line the ridge 
behind Virgil Paxton's citrus orchard. But patches of green are appearing in 
the exposed soil around them and the trees on the edge of his lemon groves, 
singed by the flames, are thick with fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the Santa Monica Mountains, there is new life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thought of everybody after a fire is that everything is destroyed," 
said Jaquie Stiver, a park ranger with the Santa Monica Mountains National 
Recreation Area. "It isn't. It's just changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Stiver leads monthly nature walks into Rancho Sierra Vista in the Santa Monica 
Mountains to observe the fire recovery. Accompanied by Boy Scouts and nature 
lovers, she studies the regrowth of plant and animal life. She has watched as 
Rancho Sierra Vista has changed from October's wasteland to spring's 
wildflower-filled meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not all fires are bad things," Stiver said. Their primary benefit, according 
to the park service, is the fresh start the fire gives some long-dormant native 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Some species, like the chocolate lily -- a flower named for its brown color -- 
haven't been seen in the Santa Monica Mountains in nearly a decade, squeezed 
out by the dense chaparral. Others require the heat of a fire to pop open their 
seed jackets and germinate. These plants, called fire followers, thrive in 
burned areas. 
</P>
<P>
 On a walking tour in Rancho Sierra Vista last week, park service ecologist Ray 
Sauvajot said plants are thriving, in some cases doing better than the park 
service had expected after last fall's devastation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really happy to see the vegetation coming back," Sauvajot said. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed to a dense patch of fire-follower Parry's phacelia, a lightly 
scented purple flower taking advantage of the ample space and nutrients in the 
soil along Big Sycamore Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The herbaceous or non-woody plants are what really spring to life quickly," 
he said. "For the next two to five years, the herbaceous plants are going to 
have great wildflower displays. Then, as the shrubs begin to reassert 
themselves, you won't see as many flowers. There will be a secession to the 
woody plants and then the cycle will start all over again. The shrubs take 
over, setting the stage for another fire to go through." 
</P>
<P>
 The shrubs, or chaparral, are doing what Sauvajot calls stump-sprouting. 
Lifeless twigs of laurel sumac stick up as tall as five or six feet, while a 
riot of glossy green and red leaves begins to cover the ground around their 
base. The dead branches will hang on for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "See across on that ridge?" asked Sauvajot. "That little dip where there is 
still chaparral? Those gray sticks are the skeletons of old shrubs, so you can 
tell a small fire came through there a few years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because that area had burned fairly recently, it was mostly spared during the 
Green Meadow fire. But some of the chaparral in the Santa Monica Mountains 
hadn't burned in 37 years, which explains why it provided such good fuel for 
October's fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the hillsides that look like bare soil from a distance are dotted with 
the sturdier flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to get out of the car to see the flowers," Sauvajot said. "They're 
hard to see from the distance." 
</P>
<P>
 At least 66 types of flowers are blooming in Rancho Sierra Vista alone, 
including three varieties of lupine, California poppies, encelia and 
Johnny-jump-ups. More are expected to blossom in the next few weeks, with late 
April expected to be the height of the wildflower bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty acres in Newbury Park reseeded by the soil conservation service and 
Thousand Oaks Public Works department at a cost of $50,000 have been the 
slowest to sprout. 
</P>
<P>
 A 250-foot-wide band from Wendy Drive down to Reino Road was hydro-seeded with 
a mixture of four native grasses and mulch, but a co-polymer requested by the 
city to combat erosion and protect the homes below from mudslides has prevented 
their growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhat like a white glue that just sticks on the ground, the co-polymer 
still hasn't dissolved despite several rainstorms. Until it does, the new grass 
cannot get through. From a distance, it looks like a blanket of light snow 
covering the hills of Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a very strong feeling among the experts that we're far better off 
letting nature takes its course," said engineer George Ehrhardt with the 
Thousand Oaks Public Works department. "But one big reason we reseeded was that 
there were large areas up there with absolutely no seed bed." 
</P>
<P>
 Ehrhardt said the co-polymer should break down after a few more storms and be 
replaced by a blanket of grasses. 
</P>
<P>
 The path and strength of the fires is still evident in many places. In the 
canyons burned by the Steckel fire in Santa Paula, some trees on upward slopes 
are covered with rust-colored dead leaves, but their trunks are barely 
scorched. At the bottom of Big Sycamore Canyon, live oaks with blackened trunks 
are showing dense green growth on the bigger branches. Scorched leaves point 
west, a reminder that Santa Ana winds blowing from the east fanned the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire scars on the trunks will show for years, Sauvajot said. "But these trees 
are alive, they're coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Remains of a mudflow from the heavy rains that followed the fires show at the 
base of the canyon -- but even among the rocky rubble, poppies and lupine are 
growing. The fender of a Model T lies nearby, swept there from far up the 
hillside, according to ranger Bob Heidinger. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal life in the burn area, like plant life, is coming back smallest-first. 
Rabbits, moles and wood rats are rapidly repopulating the meadows. Birds of 
prey hang overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few hard months with not much food available, the new plant growth is 
welcome. The tender shoots of the herbaceous plants are not only high in 
nutrients, but they apparently taste better to the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sauvajot said they found only a few animals dead after the fire. Most of the 
rodents probably burrowed under the ground -- just a foot below the surface 
temperatures were low enough for them to survive -- while deer and coyotes 
found refuge in stream beds. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant the park service feared for most was the prickly pear, a cactus that 
generally dies after fire. Near the Satwiwa Cultural Center, an entire hillside 
is covered with the collapsed succulent, grayish leaves flattened against the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 But here and there, a miniature red-tinged cactus appears, spiking off what 
looks like a dead surface.  
</P>
<P>
 "My suspicion is that it's because these are species that have lived in fire 
regions for a long time," said Sauvajot. "They've adapted."

REGIONAL REPORT; COUNTY GIVES $11 MILLION TO PURCHASE PARKLAND; SANTA MONICA 
MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY WILL BUY 662 ACRES IN TOPANGA CANYON, WHERE A GOLF COURSE 
AND LUXURY HOMES HAD BEEN PROPOSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Plans to turn the proposed site of a controversial housing project in Topanga 
Canyon into public parkland have moved forward as Los Angeles County officials 
gave $11 million to a state parks agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous decision by the County Board of Supervisors last week to release 
the money -- part of voter-approved Proposition A funds -- cleared the last 
major hurdle to resolution of the longest-running land-use dispute in Los 
Angeles County history.  
</P>
<P>
 In a surprise deal announced recently, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy 
agreed to buy 662 acres in the Summit Valley area from Canyon Oaks Estates 
Limited Partnership, which had proposed building a golf course and 97 luxury 
home sites on 257 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 The price: $19.9 million, the highest paid by the conservancy since it was 
created in 1979. Supporters of the purchase say the property is well worth the 
price because of its size and accessible location. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the entrance of Topanga," said Supervisor Ed Edelman, who brokered 
the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the deal, the development partnership -- which is part of a Disney 
family trust -- agreed to drop its plans if the conservancy could close escrow 
before April 5. The money released Tuesday allows the conservancy to finalize 
an initial purchase of 432 acres for $14.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining 230 acres must be purchased before August, 1995. Money for that 
acquisition would come either from Proposition 180, an initiative on the 
statewide ballot June 7, or from money owed the conservancy by the National 
Park Service. Although the conservancy will carry out the purchase, the 
disbursement of Proposition A funds had to be approved by the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the conservancy, and Robert Wilson, 
president of the Canyon Oaks partnership, said they foresee no problems in 
concluding the deal by next week. 
</P>
<P>
 However, ardent supporters of the Canyon Oaks golf course and housing project 
promised Tuesday that they will challenge the deal in court. "We are obviously 
not happy with this deal," said Topanga resident Paul Cook. "Disney gets the 
gold and we get the shaft." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Topanga resident, Joan Cooper, said she objected to turning the 
property into a park because of the increased traffic and noise. "Anyone from 
anywhere can drive up our streets," she said. Neighbor Bill Dillon complained 
that a park would allow the "criminal element to spew their venom" in Topanga 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 A Canyon Oaks attorney said she was unsure what effect delays caused by a 
possible legal challenge would have on the deal. Wilson has said the 
partnership would revive its development proposal if the transaction with the 
conservancy did not proceed swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
 The money made available to the conservancy Tuesday was in addition to the $29 
million released by the county last fall, bringing its total Proposition A 
disbursement to $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston said purchase of the Canyon Oaks property would delay a handful of 
acquisition projects until this summer, when $10 million in additional parks 
money becomes available. Three other projects would be delayed indefinitely -- 
a grant to the El Cariso education project and the acquisitions of Elrita Bowl 
in the Hollywood Hills and Woodland Hills Estates in the Santa Monica 
Mountains.

OUT AND ABOUT / PACIFIC WORLD OF COBBLERS: THE RECIPE TO A LOYAL FOLLOWING 
</P>

<P>
 Pacific World of Cobblers is a place that's always rolling in dough. 
</P>
<P>
 For eight years, this tiny Crenshaw-area bakery has been turning out specialty 
cobblers worthy of a mention in the Michelin Guide Book restaurant survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Taste the cobblers and you'll see why. Come early in the day and watch the 
pastry being prepared in the tiny kitchen behind the counter. The production 
pace is virtually nonstop -- about 400 to 500 pies are made per week. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular choice is peach cobbler. Blackberry, filled thick with fruit 
and light on the sugar, is another favorite. Other choices include raspberry, 
blueberry, cherry, apple and sweet potato. 
</P>
<P>
 The bakery requests 24 hours' notice for orders. Cobblers can also be 
purchased frozen and baked at home. For last-minute shoppers, the bakery's 
display case always has a few cobblers available. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific World of Cobblers, located in a mini-mall between a beauty parlor and 
a barber shop, was opened by Janie Lee Bradford, who died last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 As a youngster, she had developed a lifelong love of cooking. When Bradford 
became dissatisfied with her career as a parole officer, she quit and purchased 
a restaurant in the Crenshaw district. The restaurant thrived for more than 15 
years until she discovered that selling cobbler as a side business was equally 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 She sold the restaurant and opened the cobbler bakery. Today, the bakery is 
still family-owned and operated by Bradford's husband, Erdx, and daughter 
Cathie. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers come from near and far. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the consistency in their recipes (that sets them apart)," said Khris 
Terrell, a longtime customer and Los Angeles resident. "I can vouch for the 
quality." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific World of Cobbler, 3415 W. 43rd St., Los Angeles. Hours are 10 a.m. to

 ARCADIA INVITATIONAL 
</P>
<P>
 Malika Edmondson of St. Bernard and Monique Hennagan of Spring Valley, S.C., 
two of the nation's best high school sprinters, will meet in the invitational 
400-meter event at the Arcadia/Foot Locker Invitational Saturday at Arcadia 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 Hennagan is the national junior champion and has a best of 52.30. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmondson, the daughter of 1968 Olympian and UCLA NCAA sprint champion Barbara 
Farrell, ran 54.73 as an eighth-grader last year and will also run on the 
Vikings' 1,600-meter relay team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm well aware of my parents' track capabilities entering high school," 
Edmondson said. "I just want to establish some good times this season and set 
the pace for three more years of tough competition." 
</P>
<P>
 In the boys' events, Tyson Murphy of Santa Monica will challenge Kenny Haslip 
of Pasadena Muir and Charles E. Reid of Salem High of Virginia Beach (Va.) in 
the 110 hurdles. Haslip set a nation-leading time of 13.94 two weeks ago. Reid 
leads the challengers with 14.12, and Murphy's personal-best is 14.57. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Gilmore of Palisades, the area's top distance runner, will compete in 
the 1,600. Gilmore has a personal-best of 4 minutes 17.42 seconds. His main 
competition will come from Mark Hauser of St. Augustine of San Diego (4:11.1). 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Brownlee of Hamilton will challenge Haslip in the 300 hurdles. Haslip 
has a time of 37.74 this year, and Brownlee has run a 38.7. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Fairfax's Jason Lewis won the 110 hurdles with a time of 15.1 Wednesday at the 
Easter Festival at Dorsey High. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis also helped the Lions win the 400 relay in 42.2 and the 1,600 relay in 
3:21.6. 
</P>
<P>
 In the girls' meet, Caitlin McKenney of Marlborough won the 1,500 in 5:23.5.

</P>
<P>
 In a battle between the only Southland teams to make the NCAA Division I 
playoffs each of the past three years, Cal State Northridge beat Pepperdine, 
6-4, Monday at Eddie D. Field Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge left seven players behind because of disciplinary reasons. 
Pepperdine (19-14) committed five errors, including three by junior shortstop 
Erik Martinez, leading to four unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge took the lead for good in the fourth inning when Wave right-hander 
Adam Housely (1-1) made a throwing error after fielding a bunt. The error 
allowed two runs to score and gave the Matadors a 4-2 lead. Northridge (18-16) 
scored unearned runs in the seventh and eighth to secure the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the loss, Pepperdine has won 10 its past 14 games. TOUGH LOSS 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica pitcher Sergio Gonzalez had a no-hitter and a 1-0 lead through 
six innings March 29 against Leuzinger. Then everything went wrong in a 2-1 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Martinez reached first on an error by third baseman Dion Angelopoulos to 
start the seventh. Gonzalez then gave up a single to Danny Rodriguez and a 
two-run triple to Gerardo Jiron. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the loss, first-year Santa Monica Coach Pete McKellar is happy with 
his team's play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost only three games and two of them we should have won," said 
McKellar, whose team is 6-3 and 2-1 in the Bay League. "Gonzalez pitched great 
for us. If he keeps pitching like that, we'll get the win next time." SLOW 
START 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester traditionally is the team to beat in the Coastal Conference and 
the Comets are off to a 2-0 start this season. 
</P>
<P>
 But in nonleague play, the Comets are 1-8. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have great individual talent, but we're not putting it together as a 
team," Coach Ron Kasparian said. "Sometimes we hit the ball well, but we don't 
get the pitching. Another game, we get the pitching, but we can't field. We 
have managed to find every combination to lose games. We haven't put our 
offense and defense together except in conference." 
</P>
<P>
 Kasparian has scrambled to move players around in the field because of 
injuries. But he expects to have his normal lineup in this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Washington, whose role was limited to designated hitter because of 
injuries, will return to catcher. Washington is batting .489 with seven runs 
batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Seka Edwards, who was catching, will move to center field. Edwards, the 
leadoff hitter, is batting .361 with four stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Jones moves back to shortstop after playing center field. Jones is 
batting .360. 
</P>
<P>
 Second baseman Ramel Greenfield is batting .469 with 14 RBIs and a home run. 
</P>
<P>
 STAR SEARCH 
</P>
<P>
 Louie Baity of Culver City scored 17 points and Bryan Sterling of Pacific 
Hills had 15 as the Westside defeated the South Bay, 101-99, in a high school 
senior boys' all-star game Friday night at Gardena High. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite playing with only six players, the Westside girls managed to make the 
game close before losing to the South Bay, 60-56, in overtime. Jamilla Locke of 
Venice scored 15 points and Gina Ameri of Notre Dame Academy had eight points 
to lead the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday at Cal State Los Angeles, boys' and girls' players from the 
Southern Section will meet a their City Section rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Baity will compete for the Southern Section boys' team. The Southern Section 
girls' team, coached by St. Bernard's Lori Pawinski, will feature Viking center 
Marte Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
 STRONG PLAY 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Strong may have soared above the crowd in the Continental Basketball 
Assn., but the former Palisades High standout has struggled in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong, in his fourth season of professional basketball and second with the 
Milwaukee Bucks, acknowledges he is still learning the game. 
</P>
<P>
 He's also learning about losing. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering Tuesday's game at Orlando, Milwaukee's 19-53 record equaled 
Minnesota's as the league's second-worst behind Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you take every loss as a learning experience -- learning how we lost 
the game and what should we do to avoid it next time, so a couple of years down 
the road we'll know how to handle every situation that comes." 
</P>
<P>
 Strong, a 26-year-old 6-8 forward, is averaging 5.6 points and 3.7 rebounds 
and plays about 13 minutes a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Derek's done a nice job," Coach Mike Dunleavy said. "He's a guy we need to 
give some more playing time. I think he has the ability to be more consistent." 
</P>
<P>
 Strong signed Feb. 22, 1993, with the Bucks. He impressed the team with his 
rebounding and shooting ability during a stint with the CBA's Quad City Thunder 
in the midst of a season where he would be named the league's most valuable 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong's NBA career began in 1990, when the Philadelphia 76ers selected him in 
the second round out of Xavier. SEAN WATERS and STEVE ELLING and STEVEN HERBERT

EDUCATION: MAKING YOUR CHILD A HAPPY CAMPER; MARY LAINE YARBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For many parents, the biggest worry of summer is how to keep children 
constructively entertained and suitably supervised during the workday. For 
many, the answer is summer day camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Westside parents have a wide variety of camps to choose from, making it easier 
to find one that suits the interests of their children. But how should you 
begin the search for a summer camp and what features should you look for? 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, think about your needs and your child's interests. Hours and 
activities vary from camp to camp. It is a good idea to list your child's 
interests so you can eliminate unsuitable camps. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best ways to find good camps is word of mouth. Talk to your 
friends, neighbors and co-workers. Ask your child's teachers too, as many camps 
are operated by teachers working for summer income. 
</P>
<P>
 Before choosing a day camp, though, be sure to visit it first, keeping some 
important guidelines in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety is foremost. A day camp that is enclosed is best since it is more 
likely to keep kids in and strangers out. But a wall or fence isn't absolutely 
necessary if there is close supervision, preferably by counselors older than 
high school age. 
</P>
<P>
 There should be at least one supervisor per seven campers. 
</P>
<P>
 Aim for a program that offers a wide variety of activities because children 
get bored easily. A camp that offers sports in the mornings when it is cool and 
indoor activities during the warmer afternoons is ideal. 
</P>
<P>
 There should be freedom for your child to choose among the activities, 
depending on his or her interests and energy level. 
</P>
<P>
 Good organization is crucial. The camp should be able to tell you the 
whereabouts of your child at any time of day. Keeping a copy of such a schedule 
is wise in case you need to reach or pick up your child in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, activity and amusement can sometimes lead to injuries, so it is 
important to ensure that your child will always be near a camp staffer who is 
certified in first aid and CPR. In most cases, these skills are part of basic 
training for camp employees. Also, be certain the day camp carries liability 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you have narrowed the list of possible day camps, talk to parents of 
recent campers. If the camp is legitimate, its director should be happy to help 
you make such contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 There are dozens of reputable camps in the area. Since local parks and 
recreation departments offer varied activities with reasonable fees, they are a 
good place to start your search. YMCAs are generally worthwhile too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You can expect to pay about $20 to $30 for each eight-hour day at summer camps 
operated by most municipal park and recreation departments. Extras such as 
meals, transportation and extended day care generally cost a bit more. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, local camps operate on schedules that accommodate children 
whose schools follow traditional calendars and those attending year-round 
schools. 
</P>
<P>

SCOTT HARRIS: SCHOOL BOND WOULD BE SMART INVESTMENT; BURBANK HIGH DOESN'T EVEN 
HAVE THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM IT NEEDS TO PROVIDE PROPER AIR CONDITIONING FOR 
COMPUTERS AND OTHER HIGH-TECH EQUIPMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 To enter the gymnasium at Burbank High School, home of the battling Bulldogs, 
is to enter a time warp. The high graceful arc of the ceiling calls to mind a 
vintage airplane hangar. The varnished hardwood floor is old but true. 
"Bird's-eye maple," boasts Frank Kallem, the school's athletic director. "It's 
the best floor in the Foothill League." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a friendly place. "Welcome to the DOGHOUSE," shout the bold blue letters 
painted on a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 If this is a doghouse, then the rooms down below, away from public view, might 
be likened to a dog pound. The boys' locker room is so dark and dingy that 
coaches call it "The Dungeon." The lockers are 50 years old, so it's not 
surprising that some doors are missing. The roof on a coaches' office nearby 
leaks badly. "Every time we get a half-inch of rain," says Bob Shaw, a business 
teacher and track coach, "we've got a new swimming pool in there." 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that help -- a new school, no less -- is on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 Come Tuesday, the voters of Burbank will decide whether public education, 
under attack from so many quarters, is worth a fresh investment of $100 
million. That's the amount of the bond measure that would enable the Burbank 
Unified School District, which serves 13,000 students, to rebuild the run-down, 
70-year-old Burbank High and modernize several other schools. 
</P>
<P>
 For a modest investment -- $30 to $70 a year for most homeowners -- Burbank 
will have the facilities it needs to guide its children into the 21st Century. 
The way it is now, Burbank High doesn't even have the electrical system it 
needs to provide proper air conditioning for computers and other high-tech 
equipment. The way it is now, an attempt to patch the roof or fix the plumbing 
is just throwing good money after bad. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the argument you will hear from school board President Elena Hubbell 
and just about every civic leader in town. Hubbell says she is optimistic the 
measure will receive the two-thirds vote it needs for passage. 
</P>
<P>
 But for an optimist, she is campaigning awfully hard, giving the pitch at 
Kiwanis meetings and coffee klatches. So far, she is encouraged but not yet 
confident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm feeling this is a do-or-die situation," says Hubbell. "We don't have 
alternatives. We don't have another source of funding." 
</P>
<P>
 There are several reasons why supporters are worried. They are well aware that 
some people hold public education, no matter where, in contempt. And there is 
always a camp of people who just say no to taxes -- especially property taxes, 
the evil at the root of Proposition 13, the epic tax revolt that began in the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell, for example, could not have felt comforted by a commentary that 
appeared Tuesday in The Times. In it, Joel Fox, president of the Howard Jarvis 
Taxpayers Assn., celebrates Michigan's recent decision to abandon property tax 
as the financing mechanism for schools in favor of increased sales and 
cigarette taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "For residential property owners, the property tax is nothing more than a tax 
to be paid out of their incomes -- but not based on their incomes," Fox writes. 
"As home values increase and earning power remains flat, the onerous aspects of 
the property tax become obvious. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Proposition 13 itself," he goes on, "is just a step on the evolutionary path 
of curtailing and perhaps eventually eliminating the property tax." He asserts 
that "clearly the trend is toward diminished importance of the property tax. At 
most, the tax will end as a tax on property-related services." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless you're a policy wonk, debates over sales vs. property taxes can be 
tedious. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that is missing from Fox's argument is something that every 
homeowner knows: The value of your home is directly related to the quality of 
your local schools. Doesn't it make sense, then, that property taxes be used to 
support schools? An investment in your community is an investment in your own 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell thinks so -- and not just because she's the school board president. 
</P>
<P>
 She's also a realtor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Walk down the dimly lit hallways of Burbank High and you get the impression of 
a campus that is thriving despite itself. The rah-rah spirit can be seen in 
posters painted by students: "Burbank Is Awesome." "Burbank Power Is All We 
Need." "Nothing But Dogs!" 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, test scores in the district have slipped. But it's not like the old days 
when just about everybody spoke English at home. Now students are as apt to 
enter school speaking only Spanish or Armenian or Chinese or . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But so what? 
</P>
<P>
 If they go to Burbank High, it's like the sign says: Nothing but dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 They just need a new kennel. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; GOOD NEWS ON THE HOME FRONT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Backers of a Santa Ana shelter for single homeless women and their children 
struck exactly the right note this week in calling the festive ceremonies 
opening the facility a "celebration of good news." Orange County needs more of 
that type of news. The shelter has risen triumphantly over obstacles that 
easily might have leveled such a well-intentioned idea, the problems of red 
tape and the indifference or outright hostility of neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Single parents are the fastest-growing segment of the county's homeless 
population. It is abysmal to be on your own and forced to sleep under a freeway 
or on a park bench. But it is worse to be unable to provide shelter for your 
children as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The new shelter, called Regina House, can accommodate up to seven women and 11 
children. Mercy House Transitional Living Center, which will run Regina House, 
already operates a Santa Ana shelter for single homeless men. Mercy House was 
founded by Father Jerome T. Karcher, a Roman Catholic priest then serving St. 
Anne's Parish in Santa Ana and now at a Costa Mesa parish. 
</P>
<P>
 The two bungalows required massive renovation. To its credit, the city of 
Santa Ana contributed $128,000 in financing and Irvine gave $47,000. HomeAid 
Orange County also helped with financing, and more than 100 contractors and 
designers donated $300,000. HomeAid is the nonprofit organization of the Orange 
County chapter of the Building Industry Assn. Last year it contributed more 
than half of the $1.5 million needed for a shelter for homeless women and 
children in Orange, the House of Hope, run by the Orange County Rescue Mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the House of Hope, Regina House will offer tutoring for children, 
counseling and referrals for job training. Both facilities are designed to help 
the women and their children move into apartments after several months. Both 
shelters also benefited from neighbors thankfully able to rise above the "not 
in my back yard" syndrome. They realized that these are not people who are 
homeless because they are lazy. These are single mothers and their children who 
deserve temporary help. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's homeless population is estimated at 12,000, of whom from 3,600 to 
6,000 are children. The House of Hope and Regina House can shelter 36 children, 
so much more needs to be done. HomeAid has done a good job in building shelter 
for the homeless in the county. Regina House is a fine example of a 
public-private partnership working to solve one of society's pressing problems.

ORANGE COUNTY PLATFORM; REGISTERING TO VOTE IN THE UNITED STATES -- WHOSE RIGHT 
IS IT ANYWAY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Harold W. Ezell of Newport Beach, former INS commissioner for the western 
region and one of the leaders of a state initiative drive against illegal 
immigration, comments on the California voter registration record of the 
Mexican national arrested in the assassination of Mexican presidential 
candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is it any surprise to the citizens of California that the (alleged) killer of 
Mr. Colosio is a registered voter in the state? Is it any surprise that all of 
the open border advocates that want a status quo have not said a word about the 
terrorist that illegally came to the United States and registered to vote two 
times? Where are our elected officials on this issue? 
</P>
<P>
 Has the right to vote become so cheap and unimportant that public officials no 
longer care who is legally entitled to register to vote? There is more concern 
over the history of the gun owned by Mario Aburto Martinez than how he is able 
as an illegal (immigrant) to register to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an example of how the illegal (immigrants) have figured out how to 
access and abuse our system. Somehow we must save our state and begin to 
identify who is legally here and has a right to not only vote but get medical, 
social services and education.

 Darryl who? 
</P>
<P>
 In his second game as the replacement for Darryl Strawberry, put on the 
disabled list because of a substance abuse problem, left fielder Henry 
Rodriguez filled the role to perfection Wednesday night, smashing a pair of 
home runs to lead the Dodgers to a 3-2 victory over the Florida Marlins before 
a Dodger Stadium crowd of 44,393. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel no pressure," said Rodriguez, a big grin on his face as he talked to 
reporters after the game about the opportunity fate has placed before him. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez drove in the first two Dodger runs with a towering home run over the 
395-foot sign in right-center field in the fifth inning, picking on a 1-0 
fastball off starter and loser Ryan Bowen after a walk to Tim Wallach. 
</P>
<P>
 That pushed the Dodgers ahead, 2-1, after Jeff Conine had given the Marlins 
the early lead in the fourth inning with a home run off starter and winner Tom 
Candiotti. It was Conine's second home run in as many days. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time Rodriguez came to bat, it was the seventh inning and his club 
was tied. Bret Barberie's first home run of the season in the sixth, a ball 
that barely made it to the seats in right field, had gotten Florida even. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rodriguez, on a 2-2 changeup, gave the Dodgers back the lead and, as it 
turned out, the victory, with a drive that landed in the right-field seats just 
to the left of the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days ago, Rodriguez was comfortably settled in as the Dodgers' fourth 
outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Strawberry failed to show up for the Dodgers' final exhibition game. 
When it was learned that Strawberry would be gone from the club indefinitely, 
Manager Tom Lasorda went to Rodriguez and told him he would be starting in 
Strawberry's place. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all happened so fast," Rodriguez said. "Everybody was surprised. When 
Tommy told me, I felt the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time he took the field for Tuesday's opener, Rodriguez was relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just going to play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And play he has. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Rodriguez, who batted .311 during the spring, was two for three 
with a single, double and walk. 
</P>
<P>
 After hitting his second home run Wednesday, Rodriguez said he started 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving the applause of the crowd and the congratulations of 
teammates, he sat in the dugout and watched the replay of his game-winning hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always watch home runs," he explained. "I watch my swing to remember how I 
did it." 
</P>
<P>
 The 26-year-old from the Dominican Republic has been in the Dodger 
organization since he was signed as a free agent in 1985. But Rodriguez has 
gotten a chance to play with the big club only in the last two seasons. Over 
that span, Rodriguez had appeared in 129 games, batting .220 with 11 home runs 
and 37 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Henry has waited and waited," Candiotti said. "He's been very patient. It's a 
great story." 
</P>
<P>
 Candiotti's story Tuesday, although overshadowed by Rodriguez, wasn't so bad, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 He became the first Dodger pitcher to get a complete game in his first start 
of the season since Tim Belcher in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Candiotti hadn't gone more than six innings in the spring. But by the sixth 
inning, Candiotti wasn't ready to surrender the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a close game like that," the knuckleball-throwing right-hander said, "You 
don't want to come out. By the sixth inning, I felt like I was getting 
stronger. I felt locked in." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory broke a five-game losing streak for Candiotti, who finished last 
season 0-5 with a 4.17 earned-run average, winding up the year 8-10. 
</P>
<P>
 A new feature in Lasorda's office this season is four small birds in a cage. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Dodger manager walked into the office after the game, he said, "The 
birds were singing." 
</P>
<P>
 And so is Lasorda, who has seen his season go from despair to delirium. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's only two days old.

IT'S MAGIC DESPITE EJECTION; PRO BASKETBALL: JOHNSON'S OUSTER SPARKS 128-123 
OVERTIME VICTORY, PULLING LAKERS WITHIN 2 1/2 GAMES OF NUGGETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Laker express, Magic Johnson at the controls, got slightly sidetracked 
Wednesday night, but not enough to do major damage. Denver, the destination, 
remains in clear view. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento ripped a hole in their pride and joy, the defense that had held 
four consecutive opponents to fewer than 100 points, but couldn't get anything 
out of it. The Kings lost that chance along with an 18-point third-quarter lead 
and then the game, 128-123, in overtime before 12,066 at the Forum. The Lakers 
pulled within 2 1/2 games of the idle Nuggets for the final Western Conference 
playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings, playing without the injured Lionel Simmons and Walt Williams, 
wasted 39 points from Mitch Richmond and 32 from Spud Webb. The Lakers were 
without a key component down the stretch -- Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 When their coach got kicked out with 2:12 left in the third quarter after 
getting his second technical, the Lakers used it as a spark to close the gap 
that led to a 113-113 score at the end of regulation. Once in overtime, they 
broke to an insurmountable 125-118 lead to extend the home winning streak to 
seven games for the first time since January of 1992 as James Worthy scored a 
season-high 31-points. Vlade Divac added 22 points and 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers had reason to feel good coming in. The Nuggets lost to the Clippers 
Tuesday night on a missed layup -- "I've never rooted for the Clippers so 
hard," Johnson said -- and were heading into a stretch of Seattle, the Lakers, 
Houston, Phoenix and San Antonio. The Lakers, meanwhile, had a last-place team 
that lost to Dallas the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem. That last-place team in town was the Kings, who had already won 
four games in the season series for the first time since 1965-66 and were 
looking to join the Suns of 1992-93 as the only Western Conference teams to 
beat the Lakers five times in a row in a season. It wasn't much of a rest stop 
after playing Seattle, Houston and Atlanta and before Friday's showdown with 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened next could not have been a surprise -- the Kings led by nine 
points at halftime after Webb's three-pointer with three-tenths of a second 
left. When Richmond opened the third quarter with another three-pointer and 
Webb followed that with a basket, the cushion was up to 61-47. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 80-64 when the Lakers lost a coach and found a spark. Both came when a 
technical was called on Worthy, at which point Johnson went to midcourt to 
argue with official Ron Olesiak and got his second technical. Richmond made 
both free throws for an 82-64 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd responded by giving Johnson a standing ovation as he headed to the 
locker room. The Lakers responded with an 8-2 rally in the final 2:03, capped 
by Sedale Threatt's fallaway jumper at the buzzer, cutting the deficit to 84-72 
heading into the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 James Worthy has been sparked by his former teammate, Magic Johnson, becoming 
his coach. Opponents say so and the statistics bear it out. "They've been 
playing real hard," Rocket Coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. "The guy that's most 
noticeable is James Worthy. The guy's rejuvenated. He looks young, doing the 
things he did earlier." And consider this: Worthy was the leading scorer among 
reserves in four of the first five games under Johnson heading into Wednesday 
night, and he made up for that one other time by contributing seven assists. 
Moreover, his biggest impact has been down the stretch, shooting 51.2% overall 
the first five games but going a combined 16 for 25 (64%) in the second half. 
"I think that goes along with the general concept of the team," Worthy said. 
"Any time you change gears or have a new coaching situation, it seems to create 
some type of freshness. As the whole team has picked up, I'm part of that." So 
the change is as obvious to him as others. "I'm excited for the young guys," he 
said. "I'm excited I can still contribute. I think there were some times we 
were not in it mentally, and that has a lot to do with how we played. Some 
times, we were psychologically dead." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers put Reggie Jordan on the injured list before the game with 
recurring back spasms and activated Antonio Harvey, a move to get another look 
at Harvey before the end of the season. Harvey, the rookie forward, had made 21 
appearances, including an opening-night start, before going on the injured list 
Feb. 24 because of a strained hip muscle and missing the next 38 games. Jordan 
averaged 3.8 points, 2.4 rebounds and 8.6 minutes in 19 outings after being 
signed out of the CBA.

BO IS CENTER OF SHOW; BASEBALL: JACKSON'S STAR POWER OVERSHADOWS ALL ELSE IN 
ANGELS' 4-1 VICTORY OVER TWINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's like having a lounge act interrupted by Pavarotti. Or playing a pickup 
basketball game with Michael showing up. Or appearing in a Broadway play with 
Pacino as your stand-in. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels can win as many games as they desire this season, turn in an array 
of magnificent performances, but there always will be Bo. 
</P>
<P>
 Bo Jackson did not pitch seven shutout innings Wednesday in the Angels' 4-1 
victory over the Minnesota Twins; that was starter John Dopson, who gave up 
four hits, winning for the first time in nine months, spanning 17 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Bo did not hit a homer over the left-field fence in the fourth inning; that 
was Damion Easley, who hit his first homer in 51 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Bo did not earn a save by pitching the final two innings; that was Joe Grahe 
establishing himself as the Angels' primary closer. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was Bo sending a ball into orbit, stopped only by the auxiliary light 
standard 190 feet above the field, for an infield double. That was Bo breaking 
his bat over his knee as if it were a brittle twig. And that was Bo glaring at 
the Twins' ball boy as if he were Brian Bosworth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy is unbelievable, isn't he?" Angel shortstop Gary DiSarcina said. "He 
brings a personality to this team that we didn't have before. I can't tell you 
how much he has meant to us. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's confident, he's cocky and he's arrogant, but it's not a bad arrogance by 
any means. He can back his words up. He's such a huge talent that he takes the 
attention off all of us. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just want to stop what you're doing and watch." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bo show started in earnest in the fourth inning, when he struck out on 
three pitches, stranding runners on first and second. He screamed at himself, 
and then violently snapped the bat over his knee before stalking to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had a gun, I probably would have shot everybody," Jackson said, 
laughing. "So feel lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel Manager Buck Rodgers: "I didn't think it was the time to get into 
any discussions or say, 'How's your knee?' I just let him wander by. My mother 
didn't raise any dumb kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Said DiSarcina: "I thought, wow, at least limp or something. If I had done 
that, I would have broken my femur." 
</P>
<P>
 Act II was presented in the bottom of the fourth, when Twin catcher Matt 
Walbeck hit a foul ball toward the Twin bullpen. Jackson ran toward the ball 
before stopping when the ball boy jumped out of his bullpen seat and tried to 
catch it himself. Jackson stared at him as the crowd erupted into laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just stopped and looked at him and asked him if he wanted to play left 
field," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 For an encore, Jackson silenced the crowd in the sixth by swinging with all 
his might and hitting a towering fly ball toward right field. He immediately 
lost sight of the ball, as did everyone else in the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 He rounded first base, peeked at right fielder Kirby Puckett, and realized 
Puckett had absolutely no idea where the ball went. Puckett looked at center 
fielder Rich Becker. Becker looked at second baseman Chuck Knoblauch. And they 
all stared at one another in confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw it hit and knew it was out toward Puck," Knoblauch said. "The next 
thing I knew, I looked and said, 'That ball ain't coming down.' 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball could have come down and hit me in the head, and I wouldn't have 
known it until it hit me." 
</P>
<P>
 If this were his earlier years, Jackson might have been sprinting toward home 
by the time the ball landed. But these days, he's running with an artificial 
left hip. Knoblauch picked up the ball, noticed that Jackson had barely rounded 
second, and threw him out at third. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost it like everybody else," said Jackson, a former Heisman Trophy winner 
who was wearing a T-shirt from the Downtown Athletic Club. "I hit the speaker 
in left-center about four or five years ago too. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you don't get any points for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rodgers: "Most of us would have to take a fungo bat to hit that SOB. He 
flicks his wrists and hits it. You talk about power." 
</P>
<P>
 And you talk about a man stealing the show, completely overshadowing Dopson's 
performance. Dopson didn't allow a runner to reach third base, struck out seven 
and permitted only three fly balls during his entire stint. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the old John Dopson right there," Rodgers said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also the old Bo Jackson.

 A longstanding Masters tradition is that the reigning champion gets to set the 
menu for the Champions Dinner the next year. This week, Bernhard Langer chose 
German soup, a Thanksgiving-type dinner and Black Forest cake for desert. 
</P>
<P>
 The dinner caused Ben Crenshaw to remember what he did in 1985 after winning 
in '84: He had a big tray of appetizers and jalapeno chiles disguised as 
pickles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, both Jack (Nicklaus) and (chairman) Hord Hardin were digging in, and 
all of a sudden they both grabbed for a big glass of water," Crenshaw recalled. 
"I looked over at Hord later and he had sweat all over his forehead. But he 
never said anything. He just stuck in there."

 So much bull: Scottie Pippen of the Chicago Bulls said all NBA coaches should

 "A lot of coaches, I wonder how they become coaches when they haven't played 
the game. Reading a book doesn't make you a good coach."

CLIPPERS COME UP EMPTY AFTER LATE COLD SPELL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clippers went cold in the first seven minutes of the fourth quarter and it 
cost them Wednesday night in a 110-100 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves, 
their sixth defeat in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers scored only two baskets in the first 7:51 of the quarter as Chuck 
Person scored nine of his 18 points in a run to help Minnesota end a five-game 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Thurl Bailey completed a three-point play that sent the Timberwolves on a 
22-13 run over the first seven minutes of the fourth quarter, giving them a 
96-87 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Harper scored five straight points to cut the deficit to four points, but 
Doug West sparked a 10-2 Minnesota run with a pair of three-point plays in a 
span of 26 seconds to make it 106-94 with 1:04 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Elmore Spencer had scored eight points in a 16-3 run that gave the Clippers a 
67-59 lead with 4:20 left in the third quarter. The Timberwolves responded by 
scoring 15 of the final 22 points in the quarter, including six by West, to 
even the score, 74-74, before breaking away in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 West scored 27 points as the Timberwolves recorded their 20th victory, one 
more than they had last season. Minnesota has won six of its last 33 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominique Wilkins led all scorers with 34 points, but made only 11 of 28 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Timberwolves trailed throughout the first quarter, but a 13-2 spurt, led 
by four points from Bailey, gave them a 41-35 lead with four minutes left in 
the half. Wilkins scored 16 points in the opening half for the Clippers, who 
stayed within 48-45 at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 While one of Minnesota Coach Sidney Lowe's goals was to surpass last season's 
victory total of 19, he downplayed the 20th win. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just feels good to get a win," he said. "We're still fighting and trying 
to play for some pride."

 Clipper forward John Williams was put on the injured list with a small 
fracture in his left ankle.

 He has played in 29 games, averaging 5.5 points, 3.8 rebounds and 2.7 assists.

 When Gary Stevens talks about the Santa Anita Derby, people listen. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He has ridden half of the last six winners of the $500,000 race and has not 
finished worse than fourth in nine tries. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, he will be aboard the probable favorite, Brocco, and he would not 
trade his seat for any other. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Brocco was by far the best 2-year-old I've ever ridden," Stevens said of the 
romping winner of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile last November at Santa Anita. "If 
he develops the way we expect him to, he will be the best horse I've ever 
ridden. He has everything a horse needs to be great." . . .

<P>
 The fact is, though, that Brocco will be attempting to break a two-race losing 
streak against the two colts that have beaten him, Soul Of The Matter and 
Valiant Nature. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Factor in Wayne Lukas' formidable Tabasco Cat and the lightly raced but 
dangerous Charlie Whittingham entry of Strodes Creek and Numerous, and you have 
the most intriguing Derby field in years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "If he can stay healthy, Brocco will be able to do anything," Stevens said. 
"I'd give him a good chance in all the Triple Crown races even if he didn't 
improve from his 2-year-old form." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "He has the right attitude. He loves to compete. He's only had a few workouts 
in company because we're afraid that he would try to do too much. He has the 
right style. He has good tactical speed and can adapt to any situation." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He also has excuses. Brocco had a troubled trip on the backside last December 
when he finished second to Valiant Nature in Hollywood Futurity-record time. 
After a long layoff, he and Valiant Nature were caught by Soul Of The Matter on 
a tiring, muddy track in the San Felipe Stakes on March 20. . . .

 For sure, the Randy Winick-trained chestnut will be in good hands Saturday. .

 Stevens, 31, has won more than 3,400 races, the national money title in 1990, 
more than $100 million in purses, and 11 riding championships on the toughest 
circuit in the nation. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Racing is all in the family. His father Ron is a trainer, his brother Scott a 
jockey, and his wife Toni a former jockey and sister of rider Gary Baze. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He first visited a steam room as a wrestler in the eighth grade in Idaho. "I 
didn't know then that I would be making weight the rest of my life," he said. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 "Gary is so successful because he's a terrific athlete and horseman," agent 
Ron Anderson said. "He can come back after a race and tell you more about his 
horse than any other jockey." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens says In Excess, "on his best day," was the finest horse he has ridden. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 His favorite was On The Line, "a warrior who had been operated on and almost 
limped onto the track before the adrenaline started to flow." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The outstanding female was 1988 Kentucky Derby winner Winning Colors, "a big, 
robust filly who was mean and intimidated colts." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 However, he is reserving judgment on Winning Colors being the best 3-year-old 
he has ridden. . . .

 The Mighty Ducks said the time of their April 13 game against Vancouver at The 
Pond of Anaheim has been changed to 8:05 p.m. The change was made to avoid 
schedule and traffic conflicts with the Angels-Cleveland Indians game, which 
starts at 7:35 p.m. at Anaheim Stadium.

DUCKS LOSE, SEARCH FOR NEW GOALS AFTER OUSTER; HOCKEY: ANAHEIM IS OUTSHOT, 
45-12, BREAKING CLUB RECORD FOR FEWEST SHOTS IN A GAME DURING 4-2 LOSS TO 
FLAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They wanted to believe it wouldn't matter. They were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Jose Sharks snuffed the Mighty Ducks' last faint flicker of a chance 
to make the playoffs by beating the Kings on Tuesday night while most of the 
Ducks were in their hotel rooms waiting for the late news. 
</P>
<P>
 They knew it was all but inevitable, and they thought they were prepared. But 
they responded Wednesday night with a faint flicker of an offense in a 4-2 loss 
to the Calgary Flames, who clinched the Pacific Division title before 20,230 at 
the Olympic Saddledome. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the result they were ashamed of, it was the shot totals. The Ducks 
broke the club record for fewest shots in a game as the Flames outshot them, 
45-12. The previous low was 15 in a 1-0 loss to San Jose on Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 They also tied a club record by managing only one shot in the first period -- 
on Garry Valk's breakaway goal 47 seconds into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The only reason it was close was Guy Hebert, who earned the rare honor of 
being named No. 1 star in a road loss. Only an empty-net goal by Al MacInnis 
with 18 seconds to play made the margin two. Zarley Zalapski scored the 
game-winning goal on a power play at 4:42 of the second period with a shot from 
the left circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure the first period wasn't our best period of the year, but you've got 
to give them credit," Hebert said. "They were buzzing around, and they've got a 
great transition game right now. . . . I have to admit I was a little surprised 
to look up and see the shots were 19-1 after the first." 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't get a second shot until 1:06 of the second, when Valk scored 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 It was ugly enough that for the third time this season, Coach Ron Wilson 
declined to speak to reporters afterward. The players held a meeting among 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few older guys stood up after the game and said, 'Look, it's embarrassing, 
11 shots on net,' " Valk said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You woke up this morning and knew the race is over and our last game is 
Wednesday. . . . We've been playing playoff hockey all year, playing hard. I 
think it was a mixture of some of the guys being burnt out from the race, and 
now that it's over, you don't know how your body will react. The players know 
now you have to dig even deeper when you're not in the race." 
</P>
<P>
 Now they have to find other goals, and they say the biggest is to finish with 
more victories than the Florida Panthers, who have set an expansion record with 
32. 
</P>
<P>
 Another goal is finishing ahead of the Kings, but it's a lesser one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Years later, you don't remember that you beat the Kings by eight or 10 
points," Valk said. "You remember if you set a record." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for him, they set a record Wednesday -- one they didn't want to. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks are wearing a black silhouette of Mickey Mouse with the initials FGW 
on the left shoulder of their jerseys in memory of Frank G. Wells, the Walt 
Disney Co. president who died in a helicopter crash Sunday. . . . The starting 
time for the Ducks' final game of the season Wednesday against Vancouver at The 
Pond of Anaheim has been changed to 8 p.m. in order to stagger traffic because 
of an Angel game at Anaheim Stadium.

NHL ROUNDUP; LEMIEUX HAS HIS WAY IN 3-1 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mario Lemieux wants opposing teams to leave him alone. The New Jersey Devils 
complied. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemieux shrugged off a fine and warning from the NHL to score two goals with 
an assist Wednesday, leading the Pittsburgh Penguins to a 3-1 victory over the 
Devils at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Wednesday, Lemieux was fined $500 and warned for his outburst against 
referee Kerry Fraser in Monday's game against Tampa Bay. The incident earned 
him 22 penalty minutes, including the third game misconduct of his career.  
</P>
<P>
 Devil Coach Jacques Lemaire traced the defeat to his team's willingness to 
meet Lemieux's hands-off policy. Lemieux was alone for one-on-one 
confrontations with goalie Martin Brodeur and won both. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't leave him alone with the puck," Lemaire said. "He knows what to do 
with it. He has great hands. Two things can happen: Either the goalie makes a 
great save or it's in the net." 
</P>
<P>
 Ottawa 6, Washington 5 -- Rookie center Alexei Yashin had a goal and three 
assists as the Senators came from behind to stall the Capitals' playoff drive 
at Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay 3, Montreal 1 -- Jason Ruff and John Tucker scored in the second 
period at Montreal as the Lightning, eliminated from the playoffs, ended the 
Canadiens' 13-game home unbeaten streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford 3, New York Islanders 3 -- Geoff Sanderson scored his second goal of 
the night and 99th of his career midway through the third period at Hartford to 
help the Whalers get a tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonton 4, Winnipeg 3 -- Scott Pearson scored with 21 seconds remaining at 
Winnipeg to lift the Oilers to their fourth victory in their last five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson Emerson had two Winnipeg goals during an 18-second span in the first 
period.

MARINA GETS A VICTORY THAT SATISFIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 High school baseball coaches seldom get to sport that look of total 
satisfaction, the one derived from watching teams do things the right way. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was easy to understand the pleasant demeanor of Marina High Coach Paul 
Renfrow following the Vikings' 11-3 rout of Servite Wednesday in the semifinals 
of the Dole Big West Invitational at Windrow Park in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina (12-5) will play Lakewood for the championship tonight at Windrow Park. 
The first pitch is scheduled for 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
 All facets of the Vikings' game ran smoothly against the Friars (7-5-1), 
producing several smiles from Renfrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "This tournament has given us a chance to sharpen up some things," Renfrow 
said. "We know we can hit, but we had a few problems with our pitching early in 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now it looks like the pitching is there. I think we're going to be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Renfrow's optimism about the Vikings' pitching was further supported by 
sophomore right-hander Justin Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch (4-0) pitched a complete game, giving up only one earned run on seven 
hits. He struck out five, including two of the three batters he faced in the 
seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, pitching is always easiest with huge leads -- a luxury Lynch 
enjoyed for most of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 2-1, Marina went ahead for good in the top of the third. Junior 
Craig Wilson (two for five, four runs batted in) drove in two of the Vikings' 
three runs in the inning with a triple. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina batted around in the sixth. The Vikings had 12 hits, including four 
doubles and two triples. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior leadoff hitter David Titov was the catalyst, going three for three with 
two walks and three runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina also was helped by five Servite errors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other semifinal: 
</P>
<P>
 Lakewood 6, Irvine 1 -- Ben Rico pitched a three-hitter, striking out nine for 
Lakewood.

ERNST STARTS SAN CLEMENTE ON ROAD TO TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Clemente senior Mike Ernst had waited his entire high school baseball 
career for a start. Not wanting to blow his big chance, Ernst figured he needed 
all the inspiration he could get before taking the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 So before the game, Ernst sat down in front of the team and quoted from 
"Life's Little Instruction Book" by H. Jackson Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 He read: "Winners go into different situations acting as though they won't 
fail. And if you're going to go after Moby Dick, don't forget the tartar 
sauce." 
</P>
<P>
 Ernst's tartar sauce Wednesday was a sneaky fastball and a slow-breaking curve 
that shut down Carlsbad's big bats for five innings and gave San Clemente a 6-1 
victory in the championship game of the Carlsbad Easter Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernst (1-0) was expected to pitch only two or three innings, but he wound up 
throwing five shutout innings before tiring in the sixth and giving up one run. 
Ernst struck out one and walked three, but he gave up only four hits in keeping 
Carlsbad's hitters off balance for much of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been waiting for this for so long," San Clemente Coach Paul Prinz said. 
"He deserved a start. I had all the confidence in him." 
</P>
<P>
 But that confidence didn't stop Prinz from warming up Steve Sutherland, who 
picked up his third save with two shutout innings, in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Mike Frith sparked San Clemente's offense. He hit a two-run double to 
the right-center field gap in the first inning.  
</P>
<P>
 He also reached base on an intentional walk, a hit by pitch and a single to 
finish the four-game tournament seven for 11 with two home runs and 10 runs 
batted in. The Tritons improved to 11-4.

PREP BASEBALL ROUNDUP; FULLERTON GETS SOME RESPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senior center fielder Craig Freeman wasn't satisfied with the sort of respect 
the Fullerton High baseball team was getting this season. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't that the Indians were being ignored. They are ranked seventh in 
Orange County. Freeman just felt there were other, shall we say, less deserving 
teams in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's 7-3 Freeway League victory over third-ranked Troy at Troy ought to 
have eased his mind a little. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't belong below Troy," said Freeman, who had two hits and two runs 
batted in. "We knew we were better." 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians (12-2, 4-0), who won only three league games a year ago, proved 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a game of give and take. The Warriors (9-4, 2-2) did most of the giving 
and the Indians were more than happy to do the taking. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy, defending league champion, committed four errors that led to four 
unearned runs. It was the type of help the Indians don't normally need, not 
with five guys hitting .370 or better. 
</P>
<P>
 The most costly mistake was Brad Downing's misplay of a bases-loaded single by 
Freeman in the second inning. Downing, the Warrior right fielder, let the ball 
get under his glove. It was a three-run disaster that gave the Indians a 5-2 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just going through a bad time right now," Troy Coach Dane Ilertsen 
said. "It happens to every team. Sometimes you can fight through it." 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes you can't. Troy, which was ranked No. 1 a little more than a 
week ago, has lost four of its last six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides their problems in the field, the Warriors could not get settled at the 
plate. Fullerton's Ryan Golisano was hardly masterful, but he was more than a 
match for the Troy hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no curveball today, but the fastball was right," Golisano said. 
</P>
<P>
 Golisano (7-0) struck out six and gave up only one earned run. He is tied for 
the county lead in victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Ginter pitched the final inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been waiting for this game," Golisano said. "Troy was the defending 
league champs. We wanted to kill them." 
</P>
<P>
 They did, that is, when the Warriors weren't killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; HUDLER THRILLED TO BE BACK IN MAJORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has taken two years, a foreign tour, and a spring training release, but Rex 
Hudler finally was back in the big leagues again Wednesday night, starting at 
second base for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unbelievable what has happened to my life the last two weeks," Hudler 
said. "I get released from the Giants, we have our first baby, and two days 
later, Mr. (Bill) Bavasi is knocking on my door asking, 'Can Rex come out to 
play?' 
</P>
<P>
 "If Mr. Bavasi hadn't rescued me, I would be in the minor leagues today with 
the Atlanta Braves." 
</P>
<P>
 Hudler, who last played in the big leagues in 1992 for the St. Louis 
Cardinals, spending last year in Japan with the Yakult Swallows, says the 
experience will be invaluable to him this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, after playing there," Hudler said, "I can handle anything. I missed a 
hit-and-run sign the first week of the season, and I was dropped from second to 
eighth in the batting order the whole year. When we made the World Series, they 
told me I better not make an error. One guy made an error in the World Series 
and he was released on the spot." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Buck Rodgers was elated with his club's opening victory over the 
Minnesota Twins, but he says it still pales in comparison to the 1962 opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the year when President Kennedy threw out the first pitch," Rodgers 
said, "and in those days, that was a pretty big deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, that was before players made more money than the president, too." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Lewis, who pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings to close out Tuesday's 
victory, was greeted in the clubhouse Wednesday with a fax awaiting from his 
pal Darryl Scott. Scott, who spent most of last season with Lewis in triple-A 
Vancouver, now is pitching for the Yokohama Taiyo Whales. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott received a two-year contract for $1.6 million, but already is finding 
out about life in Japan. He is instructed to throw 100 pitches in the bullpen 
each day at the ballpark, and off the field has rudely discovered that a 
cantaloupe costs $20, and Big Macs go for $6. 
</P>
<P>
 "That could have been me," Lewis said, shaking his head. "I got a good offer, 
and we discussed it, but now's not the time to consider it. Hopefully, that 
time won't come for a while." BOB NIGHTENGALE

 San Francisco Giant closer Rod Beck was put on the 15-day disabled list 
because of a broken bone in his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
 The right-hander, who saved a club-record 48 games last season, will sit out 
at least two weeks.To fill his spot on the roster, the Giants recalled 
right-hander Tony Menendez from triple-A Phoenix. Manager Dusty Baker said

 Steve Palermo, whose career as an American League umpire ended when he was 
shot in the back while aiding a robbery victim three years ago, is returning to 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioner's office said Wednesday that Palermo will be an assistant to 
the chairman of the Major League Executive Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Palermo, 44, will handle special projects for the Executive Council, the first 
of which will be a study of the length of games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited to have an active role in helping to maintain and hopefully 
increase baseball's popularity," Palermo said.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROUNDUP; ORANGE COAST WINS IN 12TH TO STOP FULLERTON'S STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It took 12 innings but Orange Coast became the first team to beat Fullerton in 
an Orange Empire Conference softball game this season, Wednesday at Orange 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Kallemeyn scored on a fielder's choice on a ball hit by April Crosby with 
one out in the 12th to give the Pirates a 2-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory moves Orange Coast (21-10-2, 8-2 in conference) within a game of 
Fullerton (19-11, 9-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton was coming off a 1-0 victory over Riverside Tuesday night. Alicia 
Robles had pitched a no-hitter for the Hornets in that game and held OCC 
hitless for the first 5 1/3 innings Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton started the conference with a 4-1 victory over Cypress then won the 
next eight conference games by shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange Coast broke the streak when Kelsi Armbruster singled home Nicole 
Shammas in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton rallied to tie it in the seventh. Melissa Graham and Tricia Wedekind 
singled and moved up on a sacrifice by Kathy Donovan. Dee Dee Miranda bunted 
for a hit to load the bases and the tying run scored on a fielder's choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Kallemeyn stated OCC's winning rally with a single up the middle. Stefanie 
Ritchey then bunted for a hit and the runners moved up on an error. 
</P>
<P>
 Crosby slapped the ball off the end of the bat to Fullerton first baseman 
Miranda who threw late to home. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristen Varagne (5-3) got the victory in relief and Robles (14-7) took the 
loss. STEVE KRESAL

THOROUGHBRED RACING; DERBY DISTANCE IS BIG QUESTION FOR FLY'N J. BRYAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ask five people who will win the most competitive Santa Anita Derby in several 
years, and you might get five different answers. 
</P>
<P>
 But ask who will have the early lead in the 1 1/8-mile race Saturday, and 
you're likely to get the same response. 
</P>
<P>
 Fly'n J. Bryan, beaten by 22 lengths as the 7-10 favorite in the San Rafael 
Stakes, will be the pacesetter in this important prep for the Kentucky Derby. 
The son of Ogygian won his first two sprints in exceptional fashion, worked 
five furlongs in 58 3/5 seconds Monday at Hollywood Park and will be ridden for 
the first time by Pat Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy appears simple, but trainer Doug Peterson isn't willing to 
confirm the obvious. "If you can tell me what everybody else is going to do, 
I'll tell you what we're going to do," he said Wednesday. "I don't think he has 
to be on the lead." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if Fly'n J. Bryan is to have any chance of beating Brocco, Valiant 
Nature, Tabasco Cat, Soul Of The Matter and Strodes Creek, among others, he 
would have to do it by leading every step of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Distance is the main question. Peterson is confident that his colt can hold 
his own at a mile or 1 1/16 miles, but anything after that remains to be seen. 
"That's the question (he has to answer)," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by his performance in the San Rafael, a mile seems out of Fly'n J. 
Bryan's reach, but he had an excuse that day. Peterson -- and almost everybody 
else at Santa Anita on March 6 -- was surprised when he couldn't make the lead 
against Tabasco Cat. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason became apparent later. Owner Joseph Fenley's colt had colic, and it 
was a week, his trainer said, before Fly'n J. Bryan was back to 100%. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson and Dr. Maurice Valla also have a theory on what caused the 
intestinal blockage. They believe that Fly'n J. Bryan ate jimson weed, which 
accidentally found its way into his feed and bedding. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the same substance that caused the recent positive drug tests for 
trainers Richard Mandella, Mark Hennig and Ron McAnally. Fly'n J. Bryan was -- 
and still is -- stabled at Hollywood Park, as were the Mandella, Hennig and 
McAnally horses in question. 
</P>
<P>
 Fly'n J. Bryan's drill Monday suggests that he is feeling well again. After a 
less-than-alert beginning, he recorded the fastest of 33 workouts at the 
distance that day. 
</P>
<P>
 "He walked into the work, but he gradually picked it up and he went," Peterson 
said. "It was a sensational workout. Pat said it was as slow as he could get 
him to go." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fancy 'N Fabulous' pedigree indicated that she would move up on the turf, and 
the 3-year-old Somethingfabulous filly didn't disappoint her backers in the 
$81,450 Providencia Stakes on Wednesday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Closest to 3-1 second choice Rabiadella most of the way, the 11-10 favorite 
took charge in the final sixteenth of a mile and drew off under Alex Solis to 
win by 3 1/2 lengths in 1:49 for the 1 1/8 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive victory for Fancy 'N Fabulous, but not the first 
time she had finished in the money in a stake. While a maiden, she was second 
in three stakes, including the Grade I Las Virgenes in February, when she 
placed behind Lakeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabiadella, claimed for $32,000 by trainer Mike Orman last December, was 
second by a half-length over 14-1 shot Espadrille on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "She certainly felt good on the grass," Solis said of Fancy 'N Fabulous. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing about her is she's so smart. She's such a pleasure to ride. You can 
do just about anything on her." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Thirty Slews will begin another comeback today when he takes on six opponents 
in the $60,000 Gray Slewpy. 
</P>
<P>
 Rested since finishing fourth in the Breeders' Cup Sprint, the 7-year-old 
Slewpy gelding has trained well for his return. He has a history of running 
well fresh, but will have some new equipment today, wearing blinkers for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Delahoussaye, who has ridden Thirty Slews during most of the gray 
horse's career, will be back aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty Slews is the 8-5 favorite in the six-furlong event, which also 
attracted Portoferraio, Cut N. Cruise, Mister Jolie, Slerp, Scherando and Real 
West. Marmoe was scratched Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Entries will be taken this morning for the Santa Anita Derby, which will be 
Saturday's fifth race and televised by ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 In half-mile workouts Wednesday, Soul Of The Matter was clocked in 49 seconds, 
Pollock's Luck in 47 3/5 and the Charlie Whittingham-trained pair of Strodes 
Creek and Numerous in 47 2/5 and 47 3/5, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Argolid suffered another quarter crack in his right foreleg and will have to 
miss the Arkansas Derby on April 23. He also has had one on his left foreleg. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita will simulcast the Blue Grass Stakes from Keeneland, the Oaklawn 
Park Handicap and the California Derby from Golden Gate Fields on April 16. 
There will be an early post time of 12:15 p.m. that day.

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: SUPERBIKE GREAT MERKEL RETURNS WITH ROAD RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK

<TEXT>
<P>
 National championship motorcycle road racing will return to Southern 
California this weekend for the first time in five years and, coincidentally, 
so will Fred Merkel. 
</P>
<P>
 Merkel, a Stockton native who lived in Newport Beach when he was winning three 
American Motorcyclist Assn. superbike championships in 1984-86, has spent the 
last seven years in Europe, during which time he won two world superbike 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Merkel has been out of the country since '86, he still is the 
all-time leader in superbike victories with 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a factory rider for Rob Muzzy's team of Kawasaki Ninjas, Merkel will be 
one of the favorites when the AMA holds Round 3 of the national superbike 
season Sunday at the Pomona Fairplex. The 60-mile race will be over a 13-turn, 
2.1-mile road course on the Fairgrounds' parking lot -- similar to one used in 
the 1950s for stock cars and sports cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Years ago, I rode in a lot of races at Riverside and Ontario, and I'm looking 
forward to racing at Pomona," the 31-year-old rider said. "It's been a long 
time since I've raced in my home state, and a bunch of friends and family are 
coming down from Stockton. I'm just glad the AMA is bringing superbikes back to 
Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 The last AMA championship race in the area was in 1990 at Willow Springs; it 
was won by Randy Renfrow on a Honda. 
</P>
<P>
 Merkel, who lived in England and Italy the last seven years, will make a 
travelogue out of his return to the United States. He and his wife, Lorraine -- 
a former Miss England whom he met while racing in Europe -- and their 
3-year-old son, Travis, will tour historic and scenic sights in their motorhome 
between races. It has carried them from Florida to California, with trips to 
Georgia and New Hampshire ahead before they return to California. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a great way to make a living, showing my country to my wife and son," 
Merkel said. "It's a whole lot easier than keeping a home in Italy and 
traveling to 14 countries like I've been doing. My wife loves it here. After 
roughing it in Italy, she says we've come to the Land of Conveniences." 
</P>
<P>
 Merkel decided to become a full-time resident of Europe after his 1987 season, 
during which he made 14 trips to Italy and 12 to England. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody needs Frequent Flyer miles that bad," he said. "It all started so 
innocently. I had just won three U.S. championships and was invited to ride in 
England that April. I finished second and beat the world champion, so I was 
invited back and won the third race I ran at Mallory Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "This caught the attention of a sponsor from New Zealand, and he signed me on 
the rest of the season. When the FIM announced it was holding the first world 
superbike championship the following year, Oscar Rumi and I entered a bike from 
Honda of Italy and won it. Then we won it again in 1989 and I was leading 
midway through the 1990 season when I broke my neck during the Suzuka 
eight-hour race in Japan." 
</P>
<P>
 Merkel sat out the rest of the season, and when he returned in 1991, he found 
his Honda wasn't competitive with the bikes of other manufacturers who had made 
high-tech improvements. Last year, he left Honda, rode briefly for Yamaha and 
ended the season with Ducati. His highest finish was a second. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rob (Muzzy) planted the seed in my mind about returning to the U.S. a year 
ago, but I had a year to go on a contract," Merkel said. "My wife and I decided 
then that if we got another chance, we'd do it, and when Muzzy called again 
last fall, I took it. I had never ridden a Kawasaki until I signed my contract 
last November, but I had known Rob ever since the early '80s when he had Wayne 
Rainey and Eddie Lawson riding for him." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the requirements in joining Muzzy was that Merkel had to also race a 
750cc supersport bike in a support race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really leery of riding two bikes at the same event," he said, "but 
since I've ridden the supersport -- which is close to being a consumer bike 
like you can buy yourself -- I've come to enjoy it. It makes the American 
schedule quite different from the one I'm used to." 
</P>
<P>
 World superbike programs call for two 60-mile races on the same day. In the 
United States, Merkel rides a 40-mile superbike race Saturday and a 60-mile 
superbike race Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 At Daytona Beach, Fla., where a minor crash dropped him out of contention, 
Merkel also filled in for an injured teammate, Takahiro Sohwa, and shared a 
bike with Tripp Nobles to win an endurance race for Kawasaki. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second event, two weeks ago at Phoenix, Merkel finished second to Troy 
Corsers of Canada. Corsers' Ducati was protested as being illegal, but 
Wednesday the AMA disallowed the protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Merkel hopes to ride two or three more years, but when he retires, he does not 
plan to switch to cars as many cycle racers have tried to do. Instead, he plans 
to move to New Zealand, where he can turn his hobby of fly-fishing into a 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Motor Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 DRAG BOATS -- Clinton Anderson and Ron Braaksma, two of the fastest drivers in 
drag boat history, will resume their rivalry this weekend in the Mission Foods 
Springnationals at Puddingstone Lake in San Dimas. Anderson, returning after a 
life-threatening crash last November, had three runs over 216 m.p.h. in his 
Fatal Attraction last month at Firebird Lake in Arizona. Braaksma, who sat out 
the Firebird race, won eight of nine International Hot Boat Assn. races in 
Madness last year. Qualifying is Saturday, with top fuel hydro eliminations 
Sunday at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 STOCK CARS -- The Miller Genuine Draft 100, second round of NASCAR's 
Featherlite Southwest Tour, will be held Saturday night at Saugus Speedway. 
Two-time series champion Ron Hornaday Jr. of Palmdale will be the favorite on 
the tricky one-third-mile paved oval in Santa Clarita. A train race will follow 
the main event. . . . IMCA modifieds will open the Ventura Raceway season 
Friday night and will also be featured Saturday night at Imperial Raceway in El 
Centro. . . . Pony stocks and a destruction derby head Saturday night's Cajon

 BUSY AS A BEE: The buzz is that killer bees will probably be here by the next 
winter, and Fred Beams with the county's Vector Control has been darting from 
group to group to educate concerned citizenry about them. In one of five talks 
he delivered Tuesday, Beams said the Africanized honey bees deserve respect, 
but that fears about the bees are running unnecessarily high. . . . Says Beams: 
"It's like a rattlesnake, the more you know about it the better off you are."

 NIGHT MOVES: A couple of years ago, there was no Roxbury, Hard Rock Cafe or 
Planet Hollywood in Orange County. Now they'll have to make room for one more 
club: The Empire Room formally opens tonight on 17th Street in Costa Mesa. It's 
a former factory with a $3-million face lift. . . . "Appropriate nightclub 
attire required," its managers ask. It will be open Thursdays through 
Saturdays. But says a concerned manager at Roxbury: "Orange County is getting 
way overbuilt with nightclubs." 
</P>
<P>
 LIVING LEGEND? Most parks in the city of Cypress are named after trees. But 
officials break that tradition Friday with dedication of Darrell Essex Park on 
Ball Road. The city recently bought the land from Texaco, and named it after 
its veteran city manager. Essex has been in the post since 1962, longer than 
anyone else in the state. . . . Says Essex of the honor: "Normally, it's done 
after you've departed or retired. I'm very proud it's being done while I'm 
still actively participating in the growth of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 YOU DIDN'T KNOW? U.S. News & World Report this week has a double dose of bad 
news for the local home market. Orange County ranks 98th out of the top 100 
markets in housing growth, with a 3.2% drop in median value of existing homes, 
and a slightly higher drop for new homes. . . . But it's the fourth most 
expensive place to live among those markets, with an existing median house cost 
of $217,353. Most expensive: Honolulu, with a $377,029 median price tag.

<P>
 Two people who lived inside Biosphere 2 for two years were arrested Wednesday 
for allegedly breaking into the sealed environmental experiment and leaving the 
doors open so outside air could get in. 
</P>
<P>
 Abigail Alling, who has been taking responsibility for Monday's intrusion in 
calls to reporters across the country, was arrested at a Tucson motel with 
fellow crew member Mark Van Thillo.They each face felony charges of burglary 
and criminal property damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Alling and Van Thillo, among eight people who lived in the sealed dome for two 
years ending Sept. 26, are employees of the project's operator, Space 
Biospheres Ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were suspended from their jobs with the project last week by a 
court-appointed receiver representing the controversial project's financial 
backer, Texas billionaire Edward P. Bass.

 Missouri voters Tuesday narrowly defeated a constitutional amendment that 
would have allowed slot machines on riverboats. 
</P>
<P>
 The amendment would have lifted the ban in the Missouri Constitution on "games 
of chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Riverboat owners can still get a state license to offer so-called games of 
skill, such as poker or blackjack.

POLICE CHIEFS BACK WILSON'S REELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing a shared philosophy of more police and tougher anti-crime laws, the Los 
Angeles Police Chiefs Assn. on Wednesday endorsed Gov. Pete Wilson's reelection 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Pete Wilson says that every Californian has a fundamental right not to 
become a crime victim and not to live in fear -- these are the words of a 
fighter, not a liberal politician with no record on crime," said Hawthorne 
Police Chief Stephen Port, president of the group that represents more than 40 
police chiefs in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The endorsement followed a meeting between Wilson and several police chiefs.

VENTURA SCHOOLS TO POLL PARENTS ON UNIFORMS; EDUCATION: THE DISTRICT 
SUPERINTENDENT WILL ASK CITY'S 17 ELEMENTARY CAMPUSES TO SURVEY OPINION ON 
STRICT DRESS CODES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All Ventura elementary schools will be asked to poll parents about whether 
children should be required to wear uniforms, school district Supt. Joseph 
Spirito said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Spirito said he decided to give each of the Ventura Unified School District's 
17 elementary schools the choice to mandate student uniforms because of the 
high level of community support for a planned back-to-basics school that will 
couple a stringent dress code with strict discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm hearing on the basic school right now is, 'Why can't we do this in 
all schools?,' " he said. To give parents a choice, Spirito said he would "ask 
every individual school to survey parents to see if they're interested in 
school uniforms." 
</P>
<P>
 But some elementary school principals said they have not seen evidence that 
parents want student uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did have some parents individually say they don't believe in that," 
Montalvo School Principal Marie Atmore said. But, she added, families at her 
school probably would support other aspects of the back-to-basics school, such 
as strict discipline and required volunteer work from parents. 
</P>
<P>
 At Loma Vista School in east Ventura, Principal Richard Kirby said few 
students wear the oversized, baggy clothing that has sparked complaints from 
parents elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had that problem here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to having a tough dress code, the planned back-to-basics school 
will also require a certain amount of volunteer work from parents, enforce 
strict discipline among students and focus on traditional teaching methods in 
the classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 As envisioned, the school would have an open enrollment, with parents from all 
over the district able to choose to send their children there. District 
officials are still trying to determine which of the elementary schools to 
convert to a back-to-basics structure. 
</P>
<P>
 But Spirito said he is worried that the back-to-basics format will be so 
popular that one school will not be enough. And he wants to avoid establishing 
too many magnet schools in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Mound School is the district's only magnet school and is open to 
students from all over the city. All of the district's other elementary schools 
draw students only from their immediate neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Spirito said he has received about 30 letters and phone calls from parents 
around the district saying they wanted the back-to-basics school in their 
neighborhood. "Not one person who called or wrote or stopped me in the street 
said, 'I think it's a crummy idea.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is if I open a basics school it's going to be popular," he said. 
"And I don't want to destroy the concept of neighborhood schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Spirito said he personally believes school uniforms enhance student 
achievement, he does not want to try to require such a stringent dress code 
districtwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm saying, let it start from the grass roots," he said. "My whole design is 
to give people a choice, but to get them to understand the choice could be at 
their school." 
</P>
<P>
 Schools that decide against requiring all students to wear uniforms may choose 
to enforce such a dress code only for children in certain grades, Spirito said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said a school must have a consensus among parents before requiring 
uniforms or establishing other features of a back-to-basics school. School 
officials said the parent surveys will probably be conducted before the end of 
the school year.

HUD AWARDS $2.8 MILLION IN QUAKE RELIEF TO FILLMORE, PIRU; RECOVERY: SIMI 
VALLEY WILL RECEIVE AN UNEXPECTED $5.5 MILLION IN ASSISTANCE, THE THIRD LARGEST 
ALLOCATION APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL AGENCY. 
</P>

<P>
 Fillmore and Piru have been awarded $2.8 million in earthquake recovery 
funding, more than a month after the grant was promised to Ventura County, 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the same emergency program, designed to help areas hit hard by the Jan. 
17 earthquake, Simi Valley will get an unexpected $5.5-million boost and 
Thousand Oaks will receive $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, $127 million in Community Development Block Grants will be paid out to 
11 cities and two counties by the federal Department of Housing and Urban 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton said he was surprised and delighted at the 
size of the grant his city received. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously we didn't expect this kind of money," Stratton said, "We're going 
to have to sit down and rethink what we're going to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the earthquake, HUD gave Simi Valley a $738,000 grant and said 
the city could expect to receive a second payment similar in size. 
</P>
<P>
 But damage estimates soared to $350 million citywide as applications for aid 
continued to pour in. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton said the city would probably hold special public hearings to decide 
the best way to spend the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people out there who still need a lot of help," Stratton 
said. "It looks like the city is going to be in a much better position to do 
something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $127 million, Simi Valley's grant is the third-largest awarded by the 
agency. The city of Los Angeles was awarded the bulk of the funding -- $99 
million -- and Los Angeles County received $7.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore City Councilman Roger Campbell said the entire county grant allotment 
of $2.8 million is earmarked for Piru and Fillmore, which suffered more than 
$250 million in quake-related damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore officials have known about the grant for more than a month, Campbell 
said, but held off promising funds to residents until the county application 
received final approval from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's finally here and that's great news," Campbell said. "It's a godsend for 
our citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said the city will distribute the funds in the form of loans and 
grants, for assistance in rebuilding the historic downtown and in helping 
residents repair their damaged homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Thousand Oaks received a relatively small chunk of the grant, City 
Manager Grant Brimhall said he thought the federal formula for allocating funds 
was fair. He said the City Council at next Tuesday's meeting will discuss how 
best to allocate the funds among the private homes and public buildings that 
suffered earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, the greatest damage occurred at the public library, where 
the metal ceiling collapsed and a water pipe burst, causing $2.5 million in 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 But counting all the losses suffered by individuals, including broken china 
and damage to their homes, the total losses in Thousand Oaks approached $35 
million, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was $10,000 to $15,000 in losses in a whole gaggle of homes," Brimhall 
said. "It doesn't take long for that cost to add up."

NOT LETTING GIFTS GO TO THEIR HEADS; OXNARD: MOST CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS RETURN 
OR DONATE BRONZE HELMETS FROM KOREAN BUSINESSMAN.

<P>
 The Oxnard City Council got helmets for Christmas. Bronze ones. Just like the 
original from ancient Greece. So did the top city planner. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the officials were unimpressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Tom Holden put his on his TV, but took it off when his wife 
protested. "It kind of looked like a cross between Darth Vader and Hitler," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The planning director sent his back to the Oxnard businessman who had given 
it. And three council members gave theirs to charity when they discovered that 
the helmets -- replicas of one first worn 3,000 years ago at the original 
Olympic Games -- once sold for $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a valuable gift would have to be officially reported unless given away. 
And, even though Councilman Andres Herrera doubted the helmet was really worth 
much, he turned it over to a nonprofit Latino arts group. So did Holden and 
Councilman Bedford Pinkard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point was that it was either worth zero or $3,000, and I couldn't figure 
out which one," Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinkard liked the helmet. "I thought it was kind of neat. And on the council, 
we need them sometimes. But it wouldn't fit." 
</P>
<P>
 The bearer of six helmets at City Hall last Christmas was Sung Ho Park. The 
Korean businessman had received approval to open a billiards parlor in downtown 
Oxnard and wished to express his thanks to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "His intention was to say I appreciate you allowing me a new venture," said 
the businessman's friend and translator, Sam Lee. "Everybody is scared about 
what's happening downtown, so he said, 'You gave me a chance, so I'll give back 
to you through my investment.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Only Councilman Michael Plisky, who had placed the pine box containing the 
helmet under his Christmas tree to open with other presents, held onto the 
gift. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, about two weeks ago, Plisky's wife, Mabi, called Lee and asked if she 
could buy another helmet, only to be stunned by its original selling price, Lee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plisky has now given his helmet to the city's main library, where officials 
say it will be placed on display later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply can't accept gifts of that value, so we decided to donate it to the 
library," Plisky said. "Maybe it's only worth 10 bucks, I don't know. But it's 
got a nice little story with it, and kids and other people might enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 In a news release announcing Plisky's donation to the library, the councilman 
described the helmet as "a thing of beauty (that) has great historical 
significance. It is something we want to share with the whole community." 
</P>
<P>
 He said its fair market value is $3,000 and, as a collector's item, would 
appreciate up to 20% in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said City Council members need not have worried about the helmet's value. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 originally sold "like hot cakes" for $3,000 each in Korea as a 
memento at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, Lee said. But Park, the 
manufacturer of the replica helmets, had been able to sell only a couple of the 
remaining 1,500 in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "His price was $3,000, but when you have something and you can't sell it, its 
value is nothing," Lee said. Park said he gave another 10 helmets to 
acquaintances around Oxnard at Christmastime, including his landlord, his real 
estate broker and an architect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave to many people here," Park said. 
</P>
<P>
 In distributing the gifts, Park never told council members that they were 
valuable, Lee said. But brochures in the helmet boxes noted that only 2,500 
were produced and that one could be purchased for $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Manuel Lopez, who is in Japan on city business, could not be reached for 
comment. But he apparently returned or donated his helmet, because the gift was 
not listed on his annual statement of economic interest. Any gift worth $50 
must be declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the helmets' mixed reception from Oxnard officials, the 
patina-on-bronze headgear and the story behind them may catch the attention of 
library visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The helmets are said to be precise replicas of one discovered in 1875 by an 
archeological team excavating the Temple of Zeus on the island in southern 
Greece where the Olympic Games originated at least 3,500 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The two principal theories about the ancient bronze helmet are that it was 
used to dedicate the Olympic Games to Zeus, or that it was worn by competitors 
on horseback, according to Park's brochure. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1936, an Athens newspaper that owned the helmet announced that it would be 
given to the winner of the marathon at the summer Olympic Games in Berlin, then 
capital of Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Korean Son Ki Jung won the event, he refused the helmet because Korea 
was occupied by Japan and the runner did not want the artifact to fall into the 
conqueror's hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years later, the South Koreans, preparing for their own summer Olympics, 
found the helmet in a German museum and were allowed to take it to Seoul, Lee 
said. Son Ki Jung, the 1936 Olympic hero, was there for the presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 The original helmet is on display in the Korean national museum in Seoul, Lee 
said. Park's replicas were fashioned from a mold of it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Park's gifts were not only an expression of thanks to Oxnard officials, but a 
device to get his helmets before the general public and spread the story of 
Korea, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thought that if he gave the helmets to the City Council, they would 
display them at their office and people would ask about them," Lee said. "He 
wanted to promote Korea. He's so proud of Korea." 
</P>
<P>
 Library officials said the helmet display will open soon.

CAMARILLO PANEL OKS REZONING FOR HOUSING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Camarillo planning commissioners have unanimously approved a proposal to turn 
a lemon grove into a 302-unit residential development and golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, proposed by Camarillo-based Knightsbridge Holdings Inc., calls 
for the construction of 207 single-family homes, 95 condominiums and a 
150-acre, 18-hole golf course near Wright and Beardsley roads. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the commission saw this as an excellent use of the land," said 
Planning Commission Chairman Les Meredith. "When you consider that less than a 
quarter of the land was considered prime in terms of its agricultural 
properties, I think we made a good call." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission cast its vote Tuesday after a four-hour hearing at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 During their discussion before the vote, commissioners said they were in favor 
of changing the zoning of the parcel from agricultural to residential because 
the poor quality of much of the soil inhibits full development of any crops 
grown at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners also approved of the overall design of the development, which 
they said was in keeping with the city's architectural plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the commission's decision involves a zoning change in the city's 
General Plan, the City Council must give final approval to the development 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The General Plan is considered the master blueprint for all planning and 
development in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knightsbridge proposal will come before the council later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the 236-acre site is vacant, while 168 acres are devoted to a lemon 
orchard that was planted in the early 1940s. The orchard has not been actively 
farmed since last August. 
</P>
<P>
 Knightsbridge officials did not return phone calls Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ken Gose said Wednesday that while he still wants to devote further 
study to the project, so far it meets with his approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Gose said that normally he would oppose the use of farmland for residential 
development but in this case he would probably endorse the project because of 
the parcel's soil quality and because it will act as a buffer to prevent 
development of other, nearby agricultural parcels. 
</P>
<P>
 "This particular site is both hilly and its soil is less than prime quality," 
Gose said. "I still want to study the details, but so far it looks pretty good. 
I can't find any large faults yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will vote on the development at its April 21 meeting at City 
Hall, 601 Carmen Drive. The meeting starts at 5 p.m.

NAVY SEEKS TO TEST-FIRE GUN ON SAN NICOLAS ISLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Navy is seeking permission from the California Coastal Commission to 
test-fire a sophisticated Gatling gun on San Nicolas Island near areas teeming 
with seals, sea lions and marine birds. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal comes just weeks after the Navy incurred the wrath of 
environmental activists with a plan to detonate underwater explosives to test 
ship hull strengths about 20 miles away. That testing, which has been put on 
hold temporarily, is expected to kill or injure a small number of marine 
mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new proposal, the Navy wants to test-fire an updated version of its 
Vulcan Phalanx Gatling gun off a point on Navy-owned San Nicolas, which is 
about 70 miles south of Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials based at Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station say the 
test-firing -- to be conducted between May and June if approved by the 
commission -- will be performed in an area where little sea life is found. 
</P>
<P>
 The test involves firing rounds -- measuring about 8 inches in length and 
about 3 inches in diameter -- at a variety of self-propelled and towed aerial 
targets. Shots that miss their targets are expected to fall into the sea a 
little more than a mile west of the island. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials acknowledge that the test zone lies between two areas on the 
island where an abundance of marine mammals and birds are located, including 
the endangered southern sea otter and the California brown pelican. Officials 
say these animals could possibly be affected by noise and there is a remote 
possibility they could be hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials insisted, however, that the tests are safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "This test is specifically designed to be environmentally responsible," said 
spokesman Alan Alpers. "The Phalanx site was built in 1971 and we've been 
conducting Phalanx tests of this nature since that time." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal will go before the Coastal Commission on Tuesday during its 
meeting in Los Angeles. Commission staff members said at first they were very 
concerned by the tests but have since been convinced that through the safety 
precautions the Navy intends, that the tests will not harm wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal has also been reviewed by the National Marine Fisheries Service 
and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Neither objected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our position is that we would prefer of course that they don't do this," said 
Craig Faanes, Ventura field supervisor for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
"We approved of the tests because of the precautions they are taking. 
Basically, if they have to do it, they're doing it the right way." 
</P>
<P>
 The radar and computer-guided Phalanx, in service in the fleet since 1980, is 
capable of spitting out about 4,500 tungsten steel armor-piercing rounds per 
minute. Officials say its primary use is to act as a last line of ship defense 
against incoming missiles or fast-attack boats. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials said the new version of the gun must be tested in a marine 
environment before it can be certified for use by the fleet. In all, the Navy 
proposes to conduct a total of eight tests, each lasting a few seconds and 
firing no more that 400 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental activists decried the proposed testing, saying that it was the 
latest in a series of attacks by the Navy against the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the proposed "ship shock" hull-testing explosives program, Navy 
and officials of San Diego-based Scripps Institution of Oceanography have 
proposed transmitting high-volume sounds through the ocean in order to better 
understand the effects of global warming. Environmentalists won a delay in the 
tests this week based on their fears that the sounds may harm marine mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have no concern whatever for the seas," said Alan Godley, a spokesman 
for the Ventura County Chapter of the Earth Island Institute. "All of their 
statements amount to nothing more than meaningless rhetoric." 
</P>
<P>
 Maris Sidenstecker I, co-founder of Venice-based Save the Whales, also 
expressed frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "When is it going to ever end? When will they realize that what they are doing 
poses a serious threat to the marine environment? They are starting to present 
a very disturbing pattern."

SUSPECTED LEADER OF COUNTERFEIT RING HELD; CRIME: OFFICIALS BELIEVE FAUSTINO 
MORALES HEADED A NATIONWIDE SCHEME THAT COST BANKS AND OTHER BUSINESSES 
MILLIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An admitted forger who dodged his jail term last fall was arrested by local 
and federal authorities, who suspect him of participating in a 
multimillion-dollar counterfeiting scheme that stretches across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Faustino Morales was arrested by Oxnard police and U.S. Secret Service agents 
at his home Tuesday in the 1700 block of 9th Street in Oxnard on a Ventura 
County Superior Court warrant alleging he violated his probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials said they believe Morales, 26, is behind a massive 
counterfeiting scheme that has so far cost American Express $1.2 million and 
Bank of America at least that much. 
</P>
<P>
 Other businesses also have been victimized in the scheme, which involves 
duplicating payroll checks and then cashing them with false identification, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know the exact amount right now, but there are at least four main 
players in custody by the feds," said Oxnard Police Detective Len Newcomb of 
the white-collar crime unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales was scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday in Ventura County Superior 
Court, but it was postponed until next week. 
</P>
<P>
 He is in custody in lieu of $20,000 bail. He has not been charged with any 
crimes related to the counterfeiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, arraignments were also postponed until later this month for four 
Ventura men who were arrested March 30 for trying to cash counterfeit checks at 
a Reno, Nev., bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence seized in those arrests led back to Morales, Newcomb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the counterfeiting ring, which extends to at least four other 
states, made copies of various business and traveler's checks and employed a 
network of people to cash them, Newcomb said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects "have got a bunch of other folks working for them, using fake IDs 
and IDs they've obtained fraudulently," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Secret Service agents began investigating Morales and others after Morales was 
arrested July 16 at a Bank of America branch in Oxnard. He was caught trying to 
cash a $642 payroll check payable to Stephen O. Golich, an employee of Landmark 
Theaters, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales was charged with nine counts of forgery, and in August pleaded guilty 
to five of those counts. The remaining four counts were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, Morales was sentenced to one year in Ventura County Jail, five 
years probation and ordered to repay Bank of America more than $26,000. 
</P>
<P>
 He was told to report to jail Oct. 8 but never showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Secret Service Agent Kevin Riordan would not say what led his investigators to 
connect Morales to the four Ventura men arrested in Nevada. But he said the two 
cases are connected. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an ongoing investigation, and we expect additional arrests," Riordan 
said. But the forged checks have totaled "well up into the millions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno police on March 30 arrested four Ventura men believed to have organized 
the scheme after being tipped off by Secret Service agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Ngoc Nguyen, 24; Muoi Nguyen, 28; Ai Nguyen, 30, and Huong Nguyen, 21, all are 
awaiting prosecution in Reno on charges of possessing forged checks. 
</P>
<P>
 They are being held in Washoe County Jail in lieu of bail of between $166,000 
and $442,000 each. They each face between 40 and 119 counts because they 
allegedly possessed scores of fraudulent checks when they were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had some checks (drawn) on a business here in the area," said Reno 
Police Detective Frank Johnson. "They went down to our DMV here and got IDs 
made in their names and cashed the checks. We were just waiting for them." 
</P>
<P>
 A Bank of America spokesman on Wednesday declined to say how much the company 
lost to the counterfeiters. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomb said more than a dozen suspects from throughout Southern California 
could be involved in the case.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; IMPROVEMENT OF BILINGUAL PROGRAM A GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many Ventura elementary school students who speak little or no English have 
been thrust into classes where no one else speaks their language and where the 
teacher is ill-equipped to meet the children's special needs. 
</P>
<P>
 But all that may change next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Office for Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Education found last 
year that the Ventura Unified School District is in violation of federal laws 
requiring equal access to education for all students. 
</P>
<P>
 To come into compliance with federal law, the district has come up with a plan 
to improve its bilingual education program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing something we've needed to do for awhile," said Jennifer Robles, 
the district's bilingual coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem in the past has been that only five of the district's 17 
elementary schools have had enough limited-English students to fill entire 
classes and justify the hiring of certificated bilingual teachers. Those 
schools are E.P. Foster, Juanamaria, Montalvo, Sheridan Way and Will Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
 At these schools, students in kindergarten through fifth grades receive a 
complete bilingual education, learning core subjects such as math and science 
in their native language until they are proficient in English. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other 15 schools, a total of about 200 students with limited English 
have been thrown into classes with native English speakers and with teachers 
who lack bilingual training. 
</P>
<P>
 "Staffing has been the biggest obstacle," Robles said. 
</P>
<P>
 To solve this problem, Robles and other district staff members are proposing 
to the school board that in the future Ventura only hire teachers who have 
training in bilingual education or at least in teaching students from different 
cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers at the 15 schools who already have some bilingual training will be 
assigned to the classrooms of students with limited-English skills. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Robles has proposed that for some schools the district hire 
hourly teachers who could pull students out of class and teach them English for 
about 30 minutes each day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems innovative here in Ventura, but in other districts this has been 
going on quite a while," Robles said. MAIA DAVIS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COLLEGE DISTRICT LISTS '94 PRIORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maintaining campus buildings and improving students' access to financial aid 
topped the list of priorities approved this week by trustees of the Ventura 
County Community College District. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees compiled the list in an attempt to define the scope and 
importance of the issues they hope to tackle in 1994.The final version, with 
the objectives listed by priority, was released at the district board meeting 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Improving the safety and durability of campus buildings made the list, 
trustees said, because college officials have repeatedly insisted that many 
campus facilities are in need of repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasing financial aid access also topped the district's priorities, they 
said, because there is evidence that students are not enrolling at the district 
because they cannot get their financial aid soon enough or they are not aware 
they are eligible for financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Also high on the list were research to assess student achievement at the 
district, computerization of student registration and improvement of campus 
parking facilities. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; EX-WORKER SENTENCED FOR COMPUTER CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former employee of Camarillo-based Siemens Solar Industries was sentenced 
Wednesday to 90 days in jail in what authorities say is the first 
industrial-espionage case ever prosecuted in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell issued the sentence to George 
Stockhausen, a former facilities manager at the company who was convicted Jan. 
25 of one count of burglary and one count of unlawful access of a computer, 
which falls under the industrial-espionage category, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Siemens security guard caught Stockhausen downloading computer files in the 
company's legal office shortly after midnight Feb. 27, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant confessed to private investigators that he entered the locked, 
off-limits office from a rooftop and copied the files. He told them he was 
trying retrieve information on a manager's drug test. Stockhausen did not take 
the stand during his trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said it is illegal to copy computer files without permission, 
regardless of a person's motive for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell ordered Stockhausen, who lives in Lancaster, to turn himself in at 
the Ventura County Jail on April 27. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; 41-HOME PROJECT NOT FEASIBLE, PLANNERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of 18 acres off Ayers Avenue in Ojai is not likely to win approval 
for the development of 41 homes, Ojai Planning Commission members said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Belchen presented initial plans to the commission late Wednesday for a 
proposed subdivision on acreage zoned for both agricultural and residential 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 But commissioners said the project is not feasible because, among other 
things, it does not comply with the city's General Plan and would generate 80 
or more trips a day along California 33. 
</P>
<P>
 Belchen is proposing the 41-unit subdivision in an area that requires 
officials to deny such projects if they would add to peak-hour traffic along 
California 33 in Casitas Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Also going against Belchen is a rule in Ojai that only 12 single-family and 
four multifamily units can be approved each year, said Planning Director Bill 
Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 Belchen, however, vowed to fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll do anything they can to stop it, but frankly they're not going to," 
he said. "I anticipate taking it to court." JEFF McDONALD

<P>
 Casa Pacifica, a children's crisis center due to open in June, has received a 
federal grant of $960,000 to pay for medical and office equipment and 
furniture, Rep. Elton Gallegly said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter, which the county has been planning for since 1990, will open in 
Camarillo this summer with space for 48 children.The facility eventually will 
house 96 children removed from their families due to severe physical or sexual 
abuse, neglect, abandonment or other crises. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelter officials said that although they have expected the grant since the 
fall of 1992, they are happy and relieved to hear it is finally approved.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am thrilled to have the money coming at this time," said Tanya Gonzales, 
fund development manager for Casa Pacifica. "We've been on the edge of our seat 
waiting for it to arrive." 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-building complex is being constructed on 22 acres near Camarillo 
State Hospital. Casa Pacifica officials have estimated construction and 
operating costs at $10 million, which is coming from private and government 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly worked with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to 
release the funds to the local community. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; DONATION TO HELP FURNISH LIBRARIES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Longtime Ventura residents Bill and Virginia Dunkle spent many hours working 
to improve their local public libraries. The couple, who died within several 
months of each other last year, helped found the local chapter of Friends of 
the Library, and Virginia Dunkle was the group's first president. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Dunkles' two children have donated more than $10,000 in their 
parents' names to make the libraries more hospitable for users. 
</P>
<P>
 The $10,640 gift from William A. Dunkle of Danville and Ann D. Thompson of 
Ames, Iowa, to the E. P. Foster and H. P. Wright libraries is one of the 
largest gifts ever made to the Ventura libraries, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will be used to buy oak reading chairs, children's tables, wooden 
display cases and other furniture for the two Ventura libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Dunkle was a retired district manager for Southern California Edison Co.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: BEACH PARTY TO GET SPECIAL TRAIN SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Special Metrolink trains will run to Ventura for the city's ninth annual 
California Beach Party later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has agreed to pay about $18,000 to provide train service to its 
biggest special event of the year for the first time in the party's nine-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the city, the beach party features entertainment, sports and 
other activities geared around a '50s and '60s theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Three round-trip trains will run each day of the weekend event, scheduled for 
April 23 and 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Trains will stop in Simi Valley, Moorpark, Camarillo, Oxnard and Ventura. 
Tickets from Simi Valley and Moorpark will cost $3 one-way and $6 round-trip. 
From Camarillo or Oxnard, tickets will cost $2 one-way or $4 round-trip. 
Metrolink monthly pass holders can ride free, as well as children under the age 
of 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar train service to the county fair last summer attracted about 35,000 
riders and turned a profit of more than $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Advance tickets will be sold at the city halls of the areas served and at the 
train stations on the days the service is offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrance to the beach party is $5.50 for visitors 12 and older, $3.50 for 
senior citizens, and free for children under 12. SARA CATANIA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; WORKERS PROTEST RANCHER'S SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Farm workers and their advocates gathered in Oxnard on Wednesday to protest a 
reduced sentence handed down earlier this week to a Somis flower rancher 
originally charged with enslaving farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
 U. S. District Judge Consuelo B. Marshall changed the three-year prison 
sentence of Edwin M. Ives, 57, to one year in a halfway house and two years of 
house arrest under electronic surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can there be one standard of justice for those who have money and one for 
those who don't," said Karl Lawson, a former United Farm Workers union 
employee, one of about a dozen people who protested the change of sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Ives was initially sentenced in September after he pleaded guilty to seven 
criminal violations of labor and immigration law, including transporting and 
harboring undocumented immigrants and paying less than minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
 Although prosecutors dropped the slavery charge in a plea bargain, they have 
continued to argue that Ives virtually imprisoned the laborers he recruited 
from rural Mexican villages. 
</P>
<P>
 Ives has remained free pending a requested change of sentence. On Monday, 
Marshall changed the sentence, saying that Ives' imprisonment would cost dozens 
more farm workers their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Emanuel Benitez, a community worker for California Rural Legal Assistance, 
said many farm workers believed Ives' original three-year prison sentence was 
too light. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they felt that at least the message it would send to growers and the farm 
worker community is that this abuse cannot be tolerated," Benitez said. "Now 
this is sending the wrong message." 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Teran, a disabled celery worker from Oxnard, said Ives should not be 
allowed to escape prison time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that for our people there are no laws," Teran said. "I believe the 
law works only for the rich." FRED ALVAREZ

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CAUSE OF BOY'S DEATH REMAINS UNKNOWN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County coroner's office has autopsied the body of a 
15-year-old Thousand Oaks boy who collapsed and died on a school soccer field 
Monday, but results of the exam were inconclusive, an official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Coroner's officials are waiting to review old medical records and new test 
results on tissue samples from the autopsy of Giwook Lee before declaring the 
cause of his death, said Scott Carrier, a spokesman for the coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, an eighth-grader at Colina Intermediate School in Thousand Oaks whom 
friends described as friendly and outgoing, had been playing soccer during the 
lunch hour Monday when he collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 School employees performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on Lee until 
paramedics arrived and took him to Westlake Medical Center, where he was 
pronounced dead Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials said information from Lee's family indicated that he 
suffered from a congenital heart problem. MACK REED

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; 2% GAIN IN SALES TAX REVENUE REPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley sales tax revenue for the last quarter of 1993 was up slightly 
over the same period a year ago, a move that city officials said signals the 
end of the recession in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will receive $1,856,766 in sales tax revenue from the state Board of 
Equalization for the last quarter of 1993, an increase of about 2% over the 
$1,790,123 it received in the last quarter of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The city tax revenues represent 1% of sales in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this was a real definite sign that the recession has turned around 
for Simi Valley," Mayor Greg Stratton said. "Last year, we thought we hit 
rock-bottom and then started to go back up, and this confirms that." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials also said sales tax revenues in the first three quarters of 
fiscal year 1993-94 are up 5.1% over the same period the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials at the Board of Equalization, which distributes the tax 
allocations, cautioned that the figures for the last quarter of 1993 could 
still change. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not really a true reflection of what has happened," Steve Martarano 
said. "It's just an estimate." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Manager Bob Heitzman disagreed, saying the figures are part of an 
upward trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "This number does have some measure," he said. "It's based on collections due 
back to Simi Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Healthy retail sales at Christmas may have had something to do with the 
increase, Heitzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton also gave credit to a city program encouraging residents to shop 
locally. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Jan. 17 earthquake, which temporarily closed some businesses, could 
skew first-quarter 1994 figures, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a mixed bag," he said. "We may see a bounce; you know all the 
hotels were full and people were eating out a lot. But on the other hand, some 
restaurants and businesses had to close temporarily because they were damaged."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; POLICE DOG SICK WITH VALLEY FEVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Simi Valley police dog named Max is sick with valley fever, his veterinarian 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-year-old German shepherd came down with a rasping cough soon after he 
arrived at the department eight weeks ago, said Sterling Johnson, the officer 
who handles Charly, the department's other dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was coughing and acting a little more irritable than normal, so we took 
him to the doctor," Johnson said. "Realistically, though, with proper 
medication it's not going to stop him from working." 
</P>
<P>
 John Anderson, the department's veterinarian, confirmed the diagnosis with the 
Centers for Disease Control and is continuing to test Max to figure out how far 
the disease has progressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually dogs become lethargic and don't want to eat, but Max has not come 
down with those symptoms," Johnson said. "It appears to be a mild clinical 
case." 
</P>
<P>
 The airborne fungal virus, which attacks the body's respiratory system, is not 
contagious. Since the Jan. 17 earthquake, at least 170 people and 23 dogs have 
contracted the illness.  
</P>
<P>
 A 71-year-old Simi Valley man died of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Some doctors believe that dust stirred up by the quake led to an outbreak of 
the illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Max's treatment consists of a twice-daily dose of an anti-fungal pill, Johnson 
said. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITY ACQUIRES 27-ACRE HILL FOR 
$545,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The distinctive, flat-topped Fireworks Hill in the center of Thousand Oaks 
will soon become city property, and the plateau will be preserved for the 
annual Fourth of July celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted Tuesday night to buy the 27-acre parcel behind the 
former civic center on Hillcrest Drive for a total of $545,000, including 
escrow closing costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The top of the hill -- which was graded three decades ago into a flat pad -- 
will be maintained as open space or converted into a park, council members 
said. But parts of the slope could be sold to developers or attached to the 
civic center property, which is now on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten an exceptional price on this," Councilman Alex Fiore said. "We 
can keep the hill so we will be able to shoot fireworks off it in perpetuity. 
And we might make the bottom of (the civic center parcel) a lot more 
marketable."  
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Elois Zeanah and Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski voted against the 
acquisition after questioning the validity of the appraisal. In the past, they 
have suggested that the city could preserve the hilltop far more cheaply, by 
simply changing the zoning from commercial to protected ridgeline. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilmen Frank Schillo and Fiore denounced that suggestion, arguing that 
a zone change would unfairly strip the owner, Robert A. Franklyn Trust, of the 
right to develop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either you take peoples' property or you buy it, and I think buying it is the 
honorable way to go," Schillo said. STEPHANIE SIMON

STUDENTS ON SCHOOL BOARD WANT A VOICE ON MATTERS; EDUCATION: TWO SENIORS SEEK 
TO PERSUADE VENTURA DISTRICT OFFICIALS TO GIVE THEM THE RIGHT TO CAST ADVISORY 
VOTES ON NEARLY ALL ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For nearly 20 years, Ventura school trustees have set aside time at every 
meeting to hear reports from student representatives about the latest academic 
and athletic achievements at the two local high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district officially refers to the student reports as "good news." 
</P>
<P>
 But now the student board members want to do more than just give good news. 
</P>
<P>
 They want to cast advisory votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena High School senior Jason Harris and Ventura High senior Mike Schodorf, 
the board's student representatives, have asked school officials to give them 
and future student board members the right to voice their opinions and cast 
advisory votes on nearly all district issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The students have also requested that the district eventually allow student 
board members to introduce motions for board approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Ventura County school districts with high schools appoint a high school 
student to attend school board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ventura Unified District would be one of the first in the county to 
give its student representatives the right to participate freely in board 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Unified School District last fall granted its student board 
member the chance to voice opinions on most issues brought before the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Santa Paula Union High School District agreed in December to allow its 
student board member to both participate in board discussions and to introduce 
motions for trustees to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the state, an increasing number of student representatives are 
demanding greater say in school board decisions, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifteen years ago students were happy to have a representative to the board," 
said Tom Parizo, a teacher at Channel Islands High School in Oxnard who is also 
a local representative to the California Assn. of Student Councils. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, he said, "students want to participate. They want to be treated like 
adults." 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura, Harris at Buena High said he learned about the trend when he 
attended a state conference of school board members in San Jose in December. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes sense to give students more of a voice about school board decisions, 
Harris said, because they have more direct experience with school issues. 
"We're the ones in school every day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Ventura school officials appear ready to give Harris, Schodorf and their 
successors the right to voice opinions on issues and cast advisory votes on 
issues except those related to personnel issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than just hearing their good news, they need to have a say," board 
member Velma Lomax said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, for now at least, Lomax and other school officials are drawing the line 
at allowing students to bring motions before the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very much in favor of having the kids enter into the discussion of 
anything where they have some background," said Trustee Diane Harriman, a 
former high school teacher. But, she said, giving a student the power to make 
motions may be going too far. 
</P>
<P>
 "Board members are adults in the community who have been elected to do a job," 
she said. "I don't think we can turn that job over to kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Harriman said she is particularly concerned that student board members may be 
pressured by their classmates to introduce controversial motions on issues such 
as dress codes or other issues important to students. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Joseph Spirito said he will recommend that the board first give students 
the opportunity to express their opinions to the board before allowing them to 
make motions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we're ready to jump that far and that fast," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has been allowing school boards to appoint students to their panels 
since 1976. But it was only in 1990 that the state gave school trustees the 
ability to allow student representatives to cast advisory votes. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is only since 1992 that school boards have had the right to give 
students the power to make motions.  
</P>
<P>
 So far, only about 50 of the 400 districts with high schools statewide have 
given the students the right to voice opinions on matters before the board. And 
only a handful of those have granted the young people the power to make 
motions, according to the student councils association. 
</P>
<P>
 The power to cast advisory votes would also encourage student representatives 
to become informed about issues and the opinions of their classmates, Harris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, Harris and Schodorf say little or nothing after they give their good 
news reports at the school board meetings. And they usually leave early. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Harris said, "In the future, if we ever have a board that's not 
concerned about the students, this will be a way to ensure that the students' 
opinions are heard."

RESIDENTS' INPUT SOUGHT FOR SCHOOLS' 5-YEAR PLAN

 Residents in Thousand Oaks will have a chance tonight to help shape the future 
of Conejo Valley schools during a goal-setting session on topics ranging from 
computers to vocational programs and college study skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggestions made during the open forum will be used to develop a new five-year 
plan to guide budget priorities and curriculum policies for the Conejo Valley 
Unified School District. The new plan will replace long-term goals established 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 School board President Dolores Didio said several meetings have already been 
held to solicit suggestions from parents of children enrolled in Conejo Valley 
schools. Tonight's meeting is aimed at capturing the ideas of business owners, 
residents without school-age children or parents who have not voiced their 
opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'd like to see are some real definite things surfacing that the 
community would like us to move toward," Didio said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hope would be that there's some sort of a common thread that runs through 
this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some common goals appear to be emerging. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Jerry Gross said parents and community members he has talked to seem 
most interested in upgrading computers in the classroom, strengthening science 
and math skills and improving vocational programs for students who do not go to 
college or do not finish college. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition to having a strong academic base, students need to have the kind 
of skills that are going to allow them to be successful if they're not going to 
graduate (from college)," Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's existing five-year plan was developed in 1989 by school board 
members, with little direct input from the community, school officials said. 
Its broad goals focused on raising student performance, reducing 
permissiveness, urging parents to get more involved, and offering better 
support for teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member William Henry Jr. said while those goals were admirable, some 
were impossible to measure. Others were not converted into specific policies 
aimed at achieving the goal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we really botched up the planning process and we end up five years 
later with zero specifics," he said. "I'm looking for (a new plan) that 
corrects the mistakes of the one we just had." 
</P>
<P>
 Didio said some of the goals were accomplished, such as improving facilities 
by building theaters at Newbury Park and Thousand Oaks high schools. Other 
goals, she said, were more difficult to quantify. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials hope to present board members with a final list of 
recommended goals in May. The board will then vote on the new long-range plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Humbertson, who represents the PTA on a steering committee developing 
the plan, said even Thousand Oaks residents without children in school have a 
stake in the community's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids will be coming out of high school . . . they're going to be the 
leaders of tomorrow," Humbertson said. "You hope they're getting the kind of 
education that will make them good strong leaders." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's meeting will begin at 7 p.m. at Sequoia Intermediate School, 2855 
Borchard Road, Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, district officials will be available for individual meetings 
about the long-term plan on the following days: Monday, April 18, from 1 to 3 
p.m. at Colina Intermediate School, 1500 Hillcrest Drive, and at Los Cerritos 
Intermediate School, 2100 Avenida de las Flores. Tuesday, April 19, from 1 to 3 
p.m. at Redwood Intermediate School, 233 Gainsborough Road, and at Sequoia 
Intermediate School.

CITY REJECTS BAN ON HOME BUSINESSES; THOUSAND OAKS: DRAFT LAW, THREE YEARS IN 
THE MAKING, WOULD HAVE OUTLAWED OPERATIONS LIKE PHOTO STUDIOS, TATTOO PARLORS 
AND BARBERSHOPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Rejecting a draft law that took three years to craft, the Thousand Oaks City 
Council has decided that residents should be allowed to run any type of 
business from their homes -- as long as it does not disturb neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members unanimously turned down the proposal, which would have banned 
a dozen specific home-based businesses including photography studios, tattoo 
parlors, barbershops and medical clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 The same law would have imposed tough traffic restrictions on other 
businesses, making it difficult for tutors, music teachers and repair 
technicians to operate profitably, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Characterizing the proposal as "government run amok," resident Ekbal Quidwai 
echoed other angry reactions when he told the council: "We have no business 
micro-managing the lives of business people." 
</P>
<P>
 All five council members -- even those who had helped draft the law -- 
evidently agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a vote late Tuesday, they tossed the five-page proposal into the trash. 
Instead, they asked city staff to continue the current policy of requiring 
residents with home businesses to obtain permits, at a cost of $15. 
</P>
<P>
 Before issuing a permit, staff must certify that the proposed business will 
not create undue traffic, clutter, noise or odor. If neighbors complain, code 
enforcement officers will investigate and could revoke the permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that flexible system, the planning staff now issues up to 3,000 permits 
a year, and receives only five to 10 complaints. But the criteria for granting 
and withdrawing permits remains subjective: a bureaucrat's evaluation or a 
neighbor's opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to nail down more objective standards, a committee of planning 
commissioners and council members began drafting a revised law three years ago. 
The resulting document -- including a limit on the number of car trips to and 
from a home-based business -- drew mainly jeers when reviewed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we going to start monitoring, like the Gestapo, how many people come and 
go from a residence?" Ed Brodersen asked the council. "This is ridiculous. 
Let's go on to something important." 
</P>
<P>
 Another entrepreneur, Car Wash Guys owner Lance Winslow, reminded the council 
of many key inventions, from the light bulb to the Apple computer, that were 
born in garages. Tinkering and experimenting at home "has to be done in 
Thousand Oaks, as it is in the rest of the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Lazar, who helped draft the ordinance, said she only wanted 
to update a 23-year-old law and never intended to drive home-based businesses 
out of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the law had passed, its wording would have affected people like Gina 
Kassabian, who runs a telephone installation and repair business with her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
 They use their Newbury Park mobile home as an office, but travel to visit 
clients, shuttling back and forth more times than the ordinance would have 
allowed. Furthermore, the Kassabians park their repair van outside, with the 
name of their company clearly visible -- another violation of the law as 
written. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a big part of our business, and if we had to take off the sign, we 
would really fight it," Kassabian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Disgruntled with the five-page draft, and the time spent debating it, 
Councilman Alex Fiore said his colleagues should seek to streamline, rather 
than complicate, the municipal code. 
</P>
<P>
 His suggestion: "Why in the world can't we write an ordinance that says, 'If a 
business is considered, in the judgment of the council and planning staff, to 
be noxious or disturbing to neighbors, it should not be permitted.' Period."

8'S A CROWD, RENTERS' NEIGHBORS COMPLAIN TO CITY LEADERS; FAMILIES: SOME 
RESIDENTS SUGGEST STRICTER ENFORCEMENT OF OVERCROWDING LAW TO PRESERVE THEIR 
AREA'S 'INTEGRITY.' 
</P>

<P>
 Six adults and two children doesn't seem much like a family to Denise Vivero 
-- at least, not the kind of family she expects as neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there they are, renting a house on Calle Tulipan, just a short walk from 
her own home. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry at the appearance of large, extended families -- and the clutter of cars 
that comes with a passel of working adults -- Vivero on Tuesday joined other 
Thousand Oaks residents in pleading with the City Council to preserve what they 
call the neighborhood's integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, Tuesday's public hearing focused on one narrow question: whether 
the six adults and two children should be allowed to keep four cars on the 
property, two in the driveway and two in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
 But a half-dozen residents asked the council to consider a broader issue as 
well: whether the city should support relatives doubling up in homes to save 
rent, or whether the overcrowding law should be used to crack down on 
non-traditional families. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, (the landlord) can get a lot more money renting it to six people 
at a time instead of renting it to a normal -- normal meaning average -- family 
unit," Vivero said. "Please don't let him do this." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the council deadlocked, 2 to 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Elois Zeanah and Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski supported a strict 
interpretation of the city's overcrowding and parking laws, which would limit 
the tenants to two cars, both kept in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members Judy Lazar and Frank Schillo favored allowing the tenants 
to keep four cars and park in their driveway, like thousands of other residents 
who routinely disobey an arcane city law requiring cars to be stowed in 
garages. Both Lazar and Schillo own, or are part owners of, rental properties. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not the business of the council to enforce more stringent restrictions 
on this property" just because it is a rental unit, Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Alex Fiore, who has in the past expressed sympathy for driveway 
parking, will cast the deciding vote next week. Fiore left the meeting before 
the public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it did not reach a ruling Tuesday, the council did hear nearly an 
hour of testimony about the overcrowding law, which has sparked controversy in 
several recent test cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ordinance is designed to maintain integrity in the neighborhood," Bill 
Lawrence said. "This was built as a single-family neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 To allow some flexibility in the overcrowding ordinance, the council used the 
term "bona fide housekeeping unit" instead of "family." Even strangers can 
qualify as a housekeeping unit, if they prove close bonds based on social, 
economic or psychological ties. 
</P>
<P>
 By this standard, the six adults on Calle Tulipan would qualify as a family -- 
they are all siblings or in-laws, two couples and two single men. 
</P>
<P>
 The couples can afford the rent, which tops $1,000 a month for the 
four-bedroom house, only by pooling their money, landlord Nidal Barakat said. 
And they can raise cash only by working their jobs -- which requires them to 
keep four cars for transportation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the council says they can't have four cars, that's basically telling them 
to split the family, and I don't know what they would do," Barakat said. "These 
are hard economic times." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has some leverage over the Calle Tulipan property because, as a 
rental home, it is defined as a commercial use in a residential zone. To accept 
more than four tenants, the landlord had to obtain a special-use permit -- and 
as one of the conditions, the Planning Commission last year limited the home to 
two cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents urged the council to uphold that restriction, arguing that 
too many cars would create traffic problems and drive down property values. 
</P>
<P>
 But city staff presented a traffic count indicating that repeated surveys 
found no more than 20 of the street's 68 spaces were occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, City Atty. Mark Sellers warned that a judge might consider it 
discriminatory for the city to enforce the driveway parking ban only in rental 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You aren't treating rental units the same as owner-occupied homes, and you're 
going to have that as an issue" should someone take the city law to court, 
Sellers said.

OPTIONS IN SCHOOL PROGRAMS ADVOCATED; EDUCATION: SIMI VALLEY SURVEY SHOWS 
PARENTS ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN EXPANDING ALTERNATIVES AT SECONDARY LEVEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Simi Valley parents want more choices in school programs -- particularly in 
junior high and high school -- so they can select an education that best fits 
their child's needs, according to a districtwide survey released this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest interest among 4,863 families that returned the survey was in 
expanding alternatives at the secondary level. Most popular was the idea of 
starting a fundamental junior high school, which would feature a strict dress 
code and high expectations of students. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of the Simi Valley Unified School District wanted to gauge community 
support for ideas they had discussed as part of long-range planning, including 
establishing high schools centered on technology or fine arts and establishing 
a four-year high school. The district's two high schools currently serve grades 
10 through 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can conclude from this that there is solid interest out there in having 
options," Assistant Supt. Susan Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 44% of the 11,002 families that received surveys in February returned 
them, a high rate of participation, given historical levels of 10% to 12%, 
Parks said. Only about 2% of respondents sent in more than one survey, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do believe this is a starting place for dialogue as we move into an era of 
choice and alternatives," Parks told the board at Tuesday night's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board agreed to discuss the survey's results further at its annual 
planning retreat in July, when long-range goals are discussed in terms of 
budget constraints. 
</P>
<P>
 Widening choices for parents has become an increasingly hot topic since the 
failed statewide voucher initiative last year raised debate about giving 
parents the option to send their children to private schools with tax-supported 
vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's really important that we do offer other options," board member 
Judy Barry said. "I don't think we're going to be able to do a lot that costs 
money, but I see a lot of things in here that aren't going to be expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the least costly options topped the list of favored alternative 
programs, including starting a fundamental junior high and adding another 
fundamental elementary school to the two already operating with waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Establishing a high school with a science and technology emphasis would be 
more expensive, but with community backing and business partnerships it could 
be accomplished in the next several years, Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 59% of the respondents wanted a fundamental junior high, with 55% 
favoring another elementary fundamental school and 57% approving a science and 
technology high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Just over one-third of the survey respondents said they would be willing to 
transport a child to an alternative high school or junior high, Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
 The surveys were sent home with all students, Parks said. Since some families 
who responded have more than one child, the response represents more than half 
of the student population, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Responses came in highest numbers from families with children in grades 
kindergarten through eight, Parks said.

STUDENT, 16, ACCUSED IN BRAWL WILL STAND TRIAL; COURTS: JAMES LEE OF WESTLAKE 
HIGH WILL FACE CHARGES FOR ALLEGEDLY STRIKING CLASSMATE WITH A WEAPON. TWO 
SUFFERED GUNSHOT WOUNDS IN MELEE.

<P>
 A 16-year-old Westlake High School student accused of participating in an 
off-campus brawl that left two classmates wounded by gunfire in February must 
stand trial, a judge ruled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing testimony at a preliminary hearing, Ventura County Municipal 
Judge Bruce A. Clark said prosecutors had presented enough evidence to suggest 
that defendant James Lee struck a Westlake High football player with either a 
baseball bat or a 2-by-4 board during the Feb. 4 melee. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark scheduled an April 27 arraignment in Superior Court for Lee, who is 
being tried as an adult because of the seriousness of the case. Lee is charged 
with assault with a deadly weapon and assault with force likely to produce 
great bodily injury. 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested in connection with the free-for-all at North Ranch Playfield, 
a park near the school, that resulted in one student being shot in the back of 
the head and another being shot in the shoulder. Both of the injured students 
have been released from the hospital and are expected to fully recover. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators testified Wednesday that Lee and Westlake football player Curtis 
Simmons agreed to engage in a fistfight at the park. Lee arrived with up to 14 
friends armed with sticks, bats, boards, guns and other weapons, the 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two students were shot after Lee and his supporters attacked Simmons with 
fists and blunt objects, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of Lee's teen-age friends also face trials in the case. A judge will 
decide later this month whether they should be tried as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven M. O'Neil, a Ventura County district attorney's investigator who said 
he had interviewed several witnesses, told Clark that Lee and Simmons had 
maintained a feud prior to the brawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, whose nose was broken in a fight with Simmons last year, had threatened 
to shoot his adversary in school one day, O'Neil testified. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you pull a gun, I'm going to break your neck and not stop the bleeding," 
was Simmons' response, O'Neil told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Lee and Simmons arranged for backup to accompany them to the scheduled 
fight at the park, O'Neil said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said four witnesses saw Lee swinging either a 2-by-4 board or a baseball 
bat at Simmons, who suffered minor injuries in the brawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Under cross-examination, O'Neil acknowledged that two other witnesses have 
told investigators that Lee had no weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's attorney, Thomas A. Mesereau Jr., said his client denies having any 
weapon during the melee. Lee is not accused of possessing or firing a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Mesereau also reiterated an earlier statement that the prosecution against Lee 
and his three friends -- all Asian Americans -- appears to be racially 
motivated. He said Simmons and two boys who came to the park as his backup also 
should be facing criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still maintain that Mr. Simmons is not lily white in this incident, and 
that Mr. Simmons was not charged because he is Caucasian and my client is 
Asian," Mesereau said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. John A. Vanarelli denied the racism charge, saying the 
Asian American juveniles are being charged because they brought weapons to the 
brawl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had any of those Caucasian kids brought a weapon, we would have prosecuted 
them," Vanarelli said.

THOUSAND OAKS PLANNERS SCOUT MUSEUM SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Proposals to build a native peoples' museum in Thousand Oaks moved forward 
this week, as city staff began evaluating potential sites. 
</P>
<P>
 As they seek locations for a museum dedicated to indigenous people worldwide, 
city planners will also look for a site for a children's museum. 
</P>
<P>
 By sharing a parcel, the museums could save on parking and landscaping costs, 
Councilman Frank Schillo said. But he promised that the two museums would not 
be lumped into a single building -- reassuring mothers who pictured toddlers 
playing with paints in one room and smearing them on ancient masks in the next. 
</P>
<P>
 Separate citizen committees are working on each museum. A group of Chumash 
Indian descendants and others interested in a native peoples' museum toured 
Thousand Oaks with Schillo in a chartered bus last week.  
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Folkes felt a special tug when she stood at one tour site at the 
southern tip of Moorpark Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt a spiritual link," Folkes said. "I could picture my ancestors walking 
in the mountains and see what it must have been like." 
</P>
<P>
 Although neither museum proposal has yet advanced to the most critical stage 
-- finding funds and drafting blueprints -- Schillo said he was encouraged by 
the preliminary tour. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Moorpark Road cul-de-sac, Schillo said potential locations 
include the northern campus of Cal Lutheran University, the Seventh-day 
Adventist Church property in Newbury Park and the former civic center on 
Hillcrest Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Behr, the architect designing the Seventh-day Adventist commercial 
project, said a museum could be compatible with the mall but only if it were a 
large, well-financed tourist attraction. "It would have to be a really 
first-class regional museum to even merit being placed on such a valuable 
site," he said. STEPHANIE SIMON

FEARLESSLY, CALCANTE TRIGGERS CSUN SWEEP; SOFTBALL: VETERAN RIPS TWO-RUN HOMER 
AGAINST UCLA ACE IN OPENER; MATADORS POUND 10 HITS IN SECOND GAME AS WINDMILLER 
BREEZES.

<P>
 Cal State Northridge veteran Beth Calcante was unnerved that a freshman 
teammate was awed by an opposing pitcher's riseball after the rookie struck out 
in her first at-bat against UCLA Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon hearing Traci Gallian's compliment of DeeDee Weiman's pitching, Calcante 
had a few choice words for the Matadors' designated hitter. Never praise or 
fear another pitcher, Calcante told Gallian. Never. 
</P>
<P>
 An inning later, Calcante put an exclamation point on her reprimand by ripping 
a two-run home run to fuel the sixth-ranked Matadors' 2-1 victory over 
fourth-ranked UCLA in the first game of a nonconference doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps other players overheard the exchange because the Matadors (28-5) 
pounded 10 hits in the second game, including another two-run home run -- by 
Tamara Ivie -- for a 6-1 victory to complete Northridge's first sweep of the 
Bruins in 10 doubleheader meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can I say?" Northridge Coach Gary Torgeson said. "This is a first. It's 
really sweet. The first game was especially sweet with (beating) Weiman and 
having Beth hit the ball like she did." 
</P>
<P>
 Calcante, a first-team All-American last season, went two for two against 
Weiman (13-3), who before facing top-ranked Arizona last weekend had given up 
only one earned run in 97 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Calcante's blast to left field, which seem to set the tone for the 
day, was not what Torgeson had originally wanted. With Jen Fleming at first 
base, Torgeson instructed Calcante to do what she does better than any other 
Matador -- lay down a bunt. 
</P>
<P>
 But Calcante, who has 14 sacrifice bunts this season, fouled off two attempts 
before swinging away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to bunt," Calcante said. "In the four years I've been here, 
I've never not wanted to bunt when he wanted me to. But, this time I didn't 
(want to). But, I didn't try to foul them off (intentionally)." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore right-hander Jennifer Richardson, who had made only four appearances 
this season before Wednesday, got the start over junior right-hander Kathy 
Blake, who has lost three of her last five starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson (4-0), who threw a six-hitter and did not give up an earned run, 
did not waste the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Richardson) wanted it really badly," Torgeson said. "She wanted the ball. I 
like it when pitchers want it."  
</P>
<P>
 There was no question who would pitch the second game for Northridge. Torgeson 
gave the ball to senior right-hander Amy Windmiller, who has won 11 consecutive 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Windmiller (15-1), who did not surrender a hit until the fifth inning, 
finished with a four-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA (25-7), which was swept by Arizona Saturday and had not been swept in 
consecutive doubleheaders since 1986, managed its only run off Windmiller in 
the fifth. By then, Northridge already owned a 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivie's two-run blast to right-center field got the Matadors on the scoreboard 
in the third. An inning later, Northridge bunched three hits and took advantage 
of two errors by the Bruins to score four more. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivie, the Matadors' most consistent offensive player, went three for four for 
the day with three runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Terri Pearson, a right fielder who was two for three with an RBI in the second 
game, injured her shoulder during a head-first slide into second base on a 
steal and is expected to miss the Matadors' doubleheaders against New Mexico 
Friday, Colorado State Saturday and Arizona State Sunday.

DISIMONE CARRIES NEW HIGHLANDERS; VOLLEYBALL: SENIOR HAMMERS OUT 28 KILLS AS 
GRANADA HILLS HIGH HOLDS FIRST PLACE WITH FOUR-GAME VICTORY OVER CHATSWORTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cast of characters for the Granada Hills High boys' volleyball team has 
changed almost completely from last season's squad, which went undefeated 
during the regular season and advanced to the City Section 4-A semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 But if this team is still a work in progress, two threads of continuity run 
between the squads: senior Mike DiSimone and victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks in large measure to DiSimone, the Highlanders continued their winning 
ways Wednesday against Northwest Valley Conference rival Chatsworth, 15-6, 
11-15, 17-15, 15-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought this was one of our more important matches," DiSimone said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hadn't played in a week because of spring break and we hadn't played 
(Chatsworth) yet. But we played great." 
</P>
<P>
 DiSimone in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 The outside hitter is 6-foot-5 and possesses both formidable power and an 
excellent vertical leap. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to triple-block him," Chancellor Coach Steve West said. 
</P>
<P>
 But even sending three blockers was no guarantee of stopping DiSimone, who 
raised a triumphant right fist into the air after most of his match-high 28 
kills and five blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 He had four kills during an 8-1 run by Granada Hills late in the third game 
that gave his team a 14-12 advantage. But after Chatsworth regained the lead 
and threatened to take control of the match, DiSimone stood in the wings while 
teammates came to the fore. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Muir, Dan Elbert and Earnest Yun each had a crucial kill as Granada Hills 
scored the final three points of the game, with Yun's emphatic spike prompting 
the Granada Hills substitutes to leap triumphantly out of their seats -- one so 
joyously that he knocked his chair over. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth players took the kill like a punch to the solar plexus, and never 
regained their collective breaths as the Highlanders cruised to victory the 
fourth game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely lost the momentum for the fourth game after that third-game 
loss," West said. 
</P>
<P>
 In losing, the Chancellors (4-3, 3-2 in conference play) also squandered an 
opportunity to share a three-way tie for first place in the conference with 
Granada Hills and Taft. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would have been tough," Granada Hills Coach Tom Harp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry. Thanks to DiSimone's big hitting and a scrappy team effort, 
Granada Hills (7-1, 5-0) stands alone in first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills setter Victor Chang had 55 assists, Elbert had 14 kills and Yun 
chipped in with 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Palmer recorded 18 kills for Chatsworth, Tony Pray added 12 kills and 
Tony Abel had 42 assists.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: CSUN FINALLY GETS TOGETHER FOR A MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cal State Northridge baseball team might have had one of the longest 
postgame meetings in history Tuesday night at Blair Field in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors, fraught with internal problems, met with Coach Bill Kernen for 
nearly an hour after the team's 7-6 loss to seventh-ranked Long Beach State. 
Players, individually and collectively, voiced their concerns over Kernen's 
benching of several key starters. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen, who refused to allow six players to dress for the Long Beach game, 
said he will decide today which players will compete in this weekend's crucial 
Western Athletic Conference series at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs (21-14) are tied atop the WAC West Division standings with 
Northridge at 6-3. The coach acknowledged that this is likely a make-or-break 
weekend, since the Matadors (18-17) must win the WAC crown to advance to 
postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
 Even amid the strife, a conference title is within reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "They mentioned that," Kernen said after the meeting, which lasted until 
almost 11 p.m. and included the six benched players. "Everybody had something 
to say. The feeling was that they want to be back together as a group to see if 
they can become a team. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know they weren't (a team), but they think they can become one." 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen said he didn't have much to say at the meeting. But he listened. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody said all the right things," he said. "Whether they were just 
blowing smoke or if they'll actually do it on the field, I don't know." CAL 
STATE NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
 Mighty Vasey 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State scored five times in the bottom of the ninth to win Tuesday, 
which nullified a superior effort by utility whiz Brian Vasey. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasey, a 1991 graduate of Simi Valley High, has played both the infield and 
outfield this season, but hadn't pitched since high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasey gave up two runs on three hits to Long Beach (23-7) through eight 
innings before he ran out of gas. In the ninth, Vasey allowed a run on two hits 
and walked another with none out before giving way to relief help. 
</P>
<P>
 "He deserved a chance to finish," Kernen said of his decision to let Vasey 
open the inning. "It's really too bad it worked out this way. It would have 
been a great story. That was really something." 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen said the junior right-hander probably earned another shot on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Does Kernen have any second thoughts about the steps he has taken? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Kernen said without blinking an eye. "You need to institute measures to 
match the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about attacked on all sides. 
</P>
<P>
 The beleaguered six who were benched also had to deal with distractions in the 
stands at Blair Field. The stadium manager kicked the players out of the box 
seats, located along the Northridge dugout railing, because they didn't 
purchase the proper tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of Northridge parents pitched in so the players could again sit in the 
front row. JUNIOR COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 Cross the Country 
</P>
<P>
 It's been a circuitous route, but cross-country runner Jacques Salsberg has 
returned to Glendale after brief stints at Pasadena City and Butler County 
(Kan.) colleges last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Salsberg won the 1992 Western State Conference men's title for Glendale before 
transferring to Pasadena City last spring. He attended summer school at Butler 
County, but returned to Southern California in the fall after being declared 
academically ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
 He's redshirting this track season at Glendale, but is expected to be a force 
for the Vaqueros in cross-country: He has run personal bests of 9 minutes 19 
seconds in the 3,000-meter steeplechase and 30:50 in the 10,000 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "(He's) not really doing a lot of speed work right now, but he's running 
well," Glendale distance coach Eddie Lopez said. "We're still trying to improve 
his strength for the steeplechase so I'm really pleased with his times." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Isaac Turner, a state finalist in the 800 meters for Burbank High last year, 
slashed his personal best by nearly two seconds in the 800 meters Saturday when 
he ran 1:52.0 to finish sixth in his heat of the Riverside Track Classic at UC 
Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, a versatile performer who recorded bests of 49.0 seconds in the 400, 
1:53.86 in the 800 and 6 feet 4 inches in the high jump at Burbank, is capable 
of dipping under 1:50 this season, according to Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 "Me and (Glendale Coach Tom McMurray) both think that that's a reasonable 
goal," Lopez said. "(Isaac) is just learning to run the 800 at this level and 
he's got good speed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A broken arm suffered in a work-related accident prevented Glendale's Drue 
Powell from competing in the hurdles earlier this season, but he is starting to 
display the talent which helped him win the 110 high hurdles for Reseda High in 
last year's state championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell ran 14.91 to win the second heat of the 110 highs in the Riverside 
Track Classic on Saturday and McMurray figures he can run under 14 seconds by 
the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looks to me like he's made the adjustment to the college highs," McMurray 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell ran 13.87 in winning the highs in last year's state championships, but 
at 5-foot-10, there is a question about how successful he will be in college, 
where the hurdles measure 42 inches, three inches higher than in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Four former Notre Dame High baseball standouts have formed an all-Knight 
infield at Pierce College this season, and they have helped the Brahmas lead 
the Western State Conference South Division with an 8-4 record. 
</P>
<P>
 The foursome materialized when freshman Cesar Martinez earned the starting job 
at second base to join sophomores Kevin Milligan (first base), Edgar Maldonado 
(shortstop) and Lou Tapia (third base). Milligan was a designated 
hitter-outfielder last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Going into this week's games, Tapia was the leading hitter (.523) in the 
Western State Conference and Martinez was right behind at .489. Milligan was 
batting .372, but Maldonado has been experimenting with switch-hitting because 
he has been struggling at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "His frustration over hitting right-handed brought that about," Pierce Coach 
Bob Lofrano said. "I normally would not allow that (learning to switch-hit in 
middle of season), but Edgar is a great kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Tapia has been hitting the ball solidly. In a three-game span earlier this 
season, the sophomore had 10 consecutive hits in official at-bats and reached 
base 12 consecutive times in WSC South Division victories against Santa Monica 
City, Valley and Canyons. Around the Campuses. . . 
</P>
<P>
 * Glendale teammates Steve Mikesell and Randy Vickers lead the WSC in home 
runs with five each. 
</P>
<P>
 * Beth Burton of Cal State Northridge moved to seventh on the all-time Matador 
list in the women's shotput with a fourth-place effort of 44 feet 11 3/4 inches 
in the Riverside Track Classic at UC Riverside on Saturday. Burton's previous 
best of 44-0 was established earlier this year during the indoor track season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Northridge's Tyrone Gayles moved to eighth on the all-time Matador list in 
the men's hammer throw with a third-place finish of 188-6 in the Riverside 
Track Classic. Gayles set his previous best of 184-7 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cal State Northridge catcher Eric Gillespie had two hits against Long Beach 
to account for his 17th multi-hit game of the season. Gillespie, a freshman, 
has multiple hits in 13 of his last 21 games. Overall, he is batting .369 with 
36 runs batted in, 11 doubles and 55 hits. All are team highs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Though Northridge's baseball team is 18-17, only one opposing starting 
pitcher has gone the distance. The Matadors have 18 complete games, including 
eight by Marco Contreras. 
</P>
<P>
 * Junior first baseman Jason Shanahan, who did not steal a base in his first 
two seasons at Northridge, has a team-high six in seven attempts.

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: TAGLIAFERRI SOLD ON INSIDE PITCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Tagliaferri is making the jump from high school to NCAA Division I 
baseball appear easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Tagliaferri, a true freshman from Kennedy High, leads seventh-ranked Cal State 
Long Beach with a .346 batting average. He also ranks second in runs batted in 
(21) and doubles (9) for the 49ers (23-7). 
</P>
<P>
 But the transition has been far from effortless. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't easy," Tagliaferri said. "It was hard as hell. It still is to this 
day. I struggle and battle." 
</P>
<P>
 The breaking pitches are nasty, the practices exhausting, the studies tedious, 
the responsibilities sometimes overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest thing is class," Tagliaferri said. "You're going on the road and 
missing lectures. You got to get your study hall in. You squeeze that in with 
ball. You have no free time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no spring break this year. I practice till 5:30 or 6, then I got to go 
home and study. Sometimes I get frustrated. But it's worth it. College baseball 
is fun. I'd do it forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Tagliaferri led Kennedy last season with a .456 batting average, 10 doubles 
and seven home runs (tied with Rick Nadeau, now a teammate at Long Beach). He 
drove in 34 runs. 
</P>
<P>
 But college recruiters showed only lukewarm interest. Tagliaferri opted not to 
sign with the San Francisco Giants, who drafted him in the 38th round last 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 "At 8 a.m. the morning after I was drafted, Wyoming called with a 
scholarship," he said. "I'd heard of Wyoming the state, but I'd never heard of 
Wyoming the school. That night, Long Beach called. It wasn't a tough decision. 
I could be in the snow or I could be an hour away from home." 
</P>
<P>
 When he showed up for the 49ers' fall practice at 210 pounds, coaches put him 
on a weight-loss program. Then they questioned his defensive abilities, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if 49er coaches were down on Tagliaferri last fall, they don't appear to 
be now. He has started 23 of 30 games, although he doesn't bat against most 
left-handers. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, I just hoped to get some at-bats," he said. "But now I think 
I'm doing the job. I would like to think they're counting on me. I would like 
to believe I'm their first baseman." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest of all of Tagliaferri's burdens -- the school, the jump to 
big-time baseball, the weight loss (he's dropped 10 pounds) -- is the one he 
relishes most: playing for the sake of his brother, Gino Tagliaferri. 
</P>
<P>
 Gino was the most feared hitter in the Valley in 1989, his senior year at 
Kennedy. He hit 13 home runs, then signed with the Detroit Tigers, who drafted 
him in the third round. But after a shoulder injury and two sub-par seasons in 
the New York-Penn League, Gino was out of baseball. After advising Jeff not to 
sign with the Giants, Gino watches Jeff from the grandstands. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't give me a choice," Jeff Tagliaferri said. "He said, 'You're going 
to college. You can play pro ball later.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He made my decision, because he went through it. He was 3,000 miles from home 
at age 18 and he had a hell of a time. He basically went from student to just 
another guy trying to play ball. He could have gone to 10 Division I schools. 
He regrets it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now he tries to live the game through me. He wants me to do so well. When I'm 
frustrated, he's frustrated. In a way, it's like both of us playing out there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Checking the fax: Tagliaferri is one of three true freshman from the Valley 
playing at Cal State Long Beach. Casey Snow (Crespi), son of 49er Coach Dave 
Snow, is batting .222. Nadeau (Kennedy), Tagliaferri's roommate, is batting 
.231 in 13 at-bats. . . . California third baseman Justin Stark (Chaminade) 
lifted his batting average from .255 to .276 last week by going six for 14 
against Arizona State and Nevada. . . . Cal pitcher Keith Evans (Crespi), a 
true freshman, is 3-0 with a 2.48 earned-run average in Pacific 10 Conference 
games. He is tied for the conference lead in innings pitched (57.7) and is 
third in walks per nine innings (2.39). 
</P>
<P>
 USC first baseman J.P. Roberge (St. Francis) is batting .324 with eight home 
runs, 34 RBIs and 14 stolen bases. He has hit safely in 15 of the past 18 games 
and, in three games at Arizona last week, he went eight for 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols State second baseman John Aguilar (Hart, College of the Canyons) is 
batting .349 and is seven for 15 with two out and runners in scoring position. 
. . . Westmont pitcher Brian Overfelt (Glendale) threw the second one-hitter of 
his career last week, an 11-1 victory over Cal State Los Angeles. He had a 
no-hitter through 8 1/3 innings.

HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP; KRAMER HELPS SELF IN A ROYAL ROMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maki Kramer had three hits, drove in two runs and scored twice while improving 
his record to 5-0 as Royal High defeated Westlake, 11-4, in a Marmonte League 
baseball game Wednesday at Royal. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer, a senior right-hander, gave up two runs -- one earned -- in five 
innings. He allowed two hits, struck out six and walked three. 
</P>
<P>
 He and teammate Brian Fernandez (two runs scored) each went three for three as 
the Highlanders (7-3, 3-1 in league play) collected for 13 hits off three 
Warrior pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Adrian Mendoza was two for four with two RBIs and Joel Mellinger was two for 
four and scored twice for Royal, which scored all its runs in the first three 
innings.

BOOK REVIEW / JOURNALISM; HUMANITY LIES BEHIND FIERCE FACE OF NATIONALISM;

<P>
 Berlin's wall came down and a dozen others sprouted like poisonous mushrooms: 
marking off the Krajina Serbs from the rest of Croatia, tortuously sketching 
the intricate three-way bloodshed in Bosnia, outlining the ominous divisions in 
the Serbo-Albanian Kosovo, and crisscrossing a minefield of actual or potential 
nationality conflicts in the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Ignatieff, son of a Russian-born father and English-born mother, had 
always believed that "the tide was running in favor of cosmopolitans like me." 
Among urban Western intellectuals and professionals during the '70s and '80s, 
"a post-national state of mind was simply taken for granted." But when the 
nation-states of the Soviet Empire crumbled, they crumbled the other way: not 
in a cosmopolitan coming-together, but in fierce nationalist fragments. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignatieff had his van hijacked just past a U.N. checkpoint by a band of armed 
Serbs, pale, sweating and reeking of slivovitz, who accused him of spying 
because they had seen him talking to Croatians on the other side of the 
barrier.  
</P>
<P>
 "This was the moment I began to understand what the new world order actually 
looks like: paramilitaries drunk on brandy," Ignatieff writes at the start of 
"Blood and Belonging." 
</P>
<P>
 His book tells of visits to six present-day nationalisms, some warring, one or 
two simply painful. It is partly reportage; partly a reflection on what he sees 
and on the questions that trouble him and that elude those of us who live in 
comfortable, settled societies. 
</P>
<P>
 How did the bitter hatred and atrocious violence spring up so suddenly? Where 
does the passion come from? What is its nature? What part is a profound and 
even noble human need, and what part an ugly aberration? And are any of us 
really proof against it? 
</P>
<P>
 "Blood and Belonging," Ignatieff tells us, is not the work of a solitary 
traveler and cogitator. It came from a TV series, filmed by crews of cameramen, 
producers and arrangers in Yugoslavia, Germany, Kurdistan, Ukraine, Quebec and 
Northern Ireland.  
</P>
<P>
 Ignatieff is the reporter and thinker, and both his reportage and reflections 
are useful and often illuminating. Only, we lose something, as tends to happen 
with books that grow out of TV projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The writer's presence, his voice, his specific gravity -- and Ignatieff is an 
excellent writer -- are somewhat dissipated: They thin out at times or become 
overly gestural. Camera and words work passably well together -- even if 
someone else is using the camera -- but the words always seem a bit caged. 
</P>
<P>
 This said, Ignatieff, conveying both horror and sympathy, has written a wise 
and sensitive book, even if the wisdom is entangled with puzzlement. In fact, 
how could it be otherwise? He follows patiently the contradictions of the 
German predicament: Wessies and Ossies, theoretical brothers no longer, having 
to share the house, cope with East European and Third World immigrants, and try 
to find a path between tiptoeing and goose-stepping around the question of 
national identity. 
</P>
<P>
 His reportage from Yugoslavia wisely picks from a surfeit of horror a few 
telling details that make it new. In a Croatian village, a municipal work crew 
of women rebuild the house of a man whose parents were killed by the Serbian 
paramilitaries. "The Serbs are finished," the man boasts. Three of the women 
tearfully bow their heads; they are Serbs married to Croatians. The Croatian 
women stare dispassionately. "Cry, girl, cry," one says as she takes one of the 
Serbs' hands. 
</P>
<P>
 All the contradictions are in that scene. Ignatieff lived in Yugoslavia as a 
child, when his diplomat father was stationed there. The horror was not 
inevitable, he insists. Nationalism came to the Balkans only in the middle of 
the last century; the history of Serbian-Croatian hatred is relatively brief.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is not how the past dictates the present but how the present manipulates 
the past," he writes. "Nothing is inevitable: that is what makes what did 
happen so tragic." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Ukrainian village where his great-grandparents had their estate, he 
visits their grave, still tended by the local priest, and locates in himself a 
bit of the heat that in Yugoslavia became a raging fire. "Graves and nations. 
Land is sacred because it is where your ancestors lie."  
</P>
<P>
 He sees why "graves and land matter and why the nation matters that protects 
them both." He finds the same human need in a wretched colony of Tatars who 
have returned to their ancestral land in the Crimea after half a century in 
exile in Central Asia, where they were despised: "Without nationhood people 
sneer at you on the bus." 
</P>
<P>
 He finds a cheerful nationalism in Kurdistan where, under U.N. protection the 
Kurds are struggling to build a precarious state; an unexpectedly potent 
nationalism in Quebec, despite its prosperity, and a perky, doomed nationalism 
among the Ulster Protestants, who think of themselves as British and whom 
Ignatieff finds to be utterly Irish.  
</P>
<P>
 Few outside writers have troubled to reach for the humanity of Northern 
Ireland's majority community. But in his journey among nationalisms, Ignatieff 
has admirably used a cosmopolitan sensibility to find what is recognizable and 
human in what, to him and to many of us, seems most strange.

 A second-generation gang member sits in a jail cell and examines his past. A 
teen actor faces comic trials and tribulations as he tries out for the part of 
his life. A science fiction adventure mirrors the struggle of L.A.'s 
multiethnic community to get along. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything Goes," the umbrella title for three new plays written and 
performed by local, urban-area youth, will be presented at Immanuel 
Presbyterian Church on April 29 and 30 at 7:30 p.m. and at USC's Bing Theatre 
on May 23 at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mi Vida Loca" ("My Crazy Life") by Jonathan Orozco, 19; "Just Another Day in 
Show Biz" by Jose Rodriguez, 16; and "Taqwa" by Mercedes Mijares, 17, were 
developed in playmaking classes, part of many arts, education and sports 
activities offered by the Heart of Los Angeles Youth (HOLA) program serving 
hundreds of L.A.'s at-risk, mid-city youths. 
</P>
<P>
 HOLA Youth Theatre came into being after the 1992 riots, led by artistic 
director Garrett M. Brown ("Sisters"). It brings children and teens together 
with volunteer mentors who teach acting and playwrighting. Orozco, in a 
wheelchair after becoming the victim of a drive-by shooting, Rodriguez, who 
hopes to become an aircraft mechanic, and Mijares, who "writes to change 
people's minds," were invited to create their 20-minute plays after their 
involvement in several playmaking groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Performances at HOLA's Immanuel Presbyterian Church space are free (donations 
accepted); reservations, (213) 389-1148. Tickets for the USC benefit 
performance/ reception are $75; reservations, (213) 740-1286.

OIL AND VINEGAR DRESSING -- HOLD THE OIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CARROLL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These days, the well-dressed salad is not just a bowl of super-fresh 
ingredients. Good salad dressings are a must to enhance the delicate flavors of 
lettuce, vegetables and fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet trying to keep salads low in fat with homemade dressings is tricky -- a 
classic vinaigrette contains 10 grams of fat per tablespoon. Do bottled diet 
dressings become a way of life for year-round salad lovers? Or is there a 
secret to keeping flavor in and fat out? 
</P>
<P>
 I've found a number of successful substitutions for oil in homemade dressings. 
The key is to retain the proper balance of flavors. Too much of any one 
ingredient -- sharp, tangy or smooth -- can throw the balance off. 
</P>
<P>
 In most dressings, the traditional proportion is two parts oil to one part 
vinegar. I was able to replace up to one-third the oil with defatted broth, a 
vegetable puree, vegetable juices, blended low-fat cheeses such as ricotta or 
cottage cheese, nonfat milk and even balsamic vinegar -- with no flavor loss. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a recipe that called for 3/4 cup olive oil would become 1/2 cup 
olive oil and 1/4 cup broth, pureed ricotta, unsalted tomato or vegetable 
juice, or balsamic vinegar. Automatically, I've cut the calories and fat by 30% 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As I tried further reducing the proportion of oil to other ingredients, I 
noticed that flavors appeared sharper. Oil acts as a flavor emulsifier, 
creating a harmonious blend to the taste buds. To keep the balance of flavors 
when substituting or reducing the oil, I had to reduce the amount of 
stronger-tasting ingredients such as grated onion, garlic and cayenne pepper; 
they tasted much more powerful than in the original recipe. 
</P>
<P>
 Another result of reducing the oil further was that the dressing was less able 
to adhere to and coat the lettuce -- the essential job of all dressings. A 
salad dressing is not successful if it pools in the bottom of the bowl. So, to 
create creaminess, I added a small amount of low-fat plain yogurt or pureed 
roasted sweet peppers. The bit of fat in the yogurt was much less than the 
original amount in the oil, and it helped the dressing bind together.  
</P>
<P>
 The roasted and peeled sweet red peppers, which are sold in jars in the 
supermarket, became a staple for my doctored dressings. The peppers lent a 
grilled or barbecued flavor, a light rose color and -- when pureed first -- a 
smooth silky texture reminiscent of fat. Green peppers worked well too, 
although they were not as sweet as red. 
</P>
<P>
 I also discovered that using stronger-tasting oils gave me more flavor 
mileage. For example, dark or toasted sesame oil can be used in smaller amounts 
than olive oil, yet the pungent flavor makes the dressing taste richer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The following salad is an example of how the potent flavor of dark sesame oil 
can be used in a very small quantity to give a big effect. CHINESE VEGETABLE

MIKE PENNER: FRIENDSHIP OPENS DOOR FOR DOPSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whitey Herzog had his Joe Magrane, Buck Rodgers has his John Dopson. This only 
seems fair. If Herzog can ring up an old friend and make like Ed McMahon -- Joe 
Magrane, you have just won $13.3 million! -- Rodgers certainly is entitled to 
his one phone call when Magrane gets his pitching arm sliced open and can't 
start the season. 
</P>
<P>
 In case of emergency, break out the Rolodex. Dopson and Rodgers did time 
together in Montreal, nothing worth writing home about, really, but enough to 
jog Rodgers' memory as he rummaged through the discard file, looking for anyone 
with two arms, who could throw a baseball faster than the freeway speed limit, 
who could throw a baseball in the general direction of home plate. 
</P>
<P>
 This was in early February, less than two weeks before pitchers and catchers 
report. At the time, Dopson wasn't reporting anywhere. He was out of work and 
for good reason -- an 0-6 record after the 1993 All-Star break, a 6.60 
earned-run average in the second half, the eighth-lowest overall winning 
percentage in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
 Among general managers, Dopson was known by his record as Mr. Big Gulp -- 7-11 
in 1992, 7-11 in 1993. He was also known by his record as no Mr. Clutch -- in 
the months of August and September, 1992-93, he was a combined 1-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewing the situation pragmatically, Dopson says he "kinda figured nobody 
would be knocking down the door." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dopson received a call from the Angels, not because of what he throws, but 
who he knows. 
</P>
<P>
 "When in doubt, get somebody you know about," says Rodgers, who managed the 
Expos from 1985 through early 1991 and now collects them in Anaheim. Dopson is 
one of five ex-Expos on the Angel roster, joining Mark Langston, Rex Hudler, 
Spike Owen and Bill Sampen as privileged Orange County FOBs -- Friends of Buck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very common in baseball," Rodgers says. "Everything else being 
equal, you like to go with guys you know. There are certain guys you're 
comfortable with and when you see one of them out there, you say, 'Hey, I got a 
good spot for him.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In Dopson's case, Rodgers had that and then some. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, it was just a matter of nobody being out there," Rodgers says. 
"And we weren't going to go big bucks for him. But we needed someone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that if we could get John back to where he was, we could get a pitcher 
who'd help us." 
</P>
<P>
 Two games into a new season, Dopson already has. Wednesday night inside the 
Metrodome, for the first time since last July 8, Dopson pitched a winning 
baseball game. For the first time since who knows when, he pitched seven 
scoreless innings, yielded no extra-base hits and permitted only two runners to 
advance as far as second base. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels won, 4-1, and now they're 2-0 against the Minnesota Twins and 
undefeated against the world. Rodgers swore the Angels would be better this 
year, but who'd have known they'd carry it this far into the season? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the old John Dopson you saw throw tonight," Rodgers said, delighted in 
two statistics in particular: 
</P>
<P>
 Ground ball outs: 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Different pitches thrown: 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "He threw a lot of ground balls," Rodgers said. "That's when his sinker is 
going good. And he used three pitches reasonably well . . . "Last year we saw 
him with Boston, and he was strictly a two-pitch pitcher. You want to be 
successful up here, you need more than that. Nolan Ryan eventually had to go to 
a changeup. Koufax used a forkball. 
</P>
<P>
 "John had a changeup when he was with me in Montreal, but he wasn't throwing 
it much anymore. We emphasized it when he came here. We didn't teach him 
anything new, we just told him to show the changeup 10, 12 times a game." 
</P>
<P>
 Any way Dopson looked at it Wednesday night, a change of pace was nice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long time," said Dopson, winning pitcher. "I was 7-5 at the 
All-Star break last year and I don't think I won another game after that. Some 
of it was because of bad luck, but I also made a lot of bad pitches. I was 
worrying about free agency. It just didn't work out for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "After four years in Boston, I felt I really needed to breathe some fresh air. 
I had a few feelers from Minnesota, but they train right next to Boston in 
Florida. I wanted to get out of Florida, to get as far away from Boston as I 
could. Make a clean break." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he has been tossed into a two-man pitch-off, Dopson vs. Mark Leiter, to 
see who stays in the rotation when Magrane returns, possibly early next month. 
In managerial terms, this is known as "creative tension." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can stand here and say I don't think about it," Dopson said, "but the truth 
is everybody does. It's just a matter of me stepping on the rubber and making 
the pitches I need to make. If I get caught up in what the other guy's doing, I 
won't do well." 
</P>
<P>
 "If John Dopson continues to pitch well, he's going to keep pitching," Rodgers 
said, dangling the carrot. "If it's not broke, don't fix it." 
</P>
<P>
 But . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "But," Rodgers went on, "we're two games into the season. Don't start making 
too many assumptions already." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Dopson is assuming he pitches again on Monday. For now, that's more 
than enough.

IRRITATED BY INSULTS, EVERETT GOES AFTER CABLE TALK SHOW HOST; MEDIA: FORMER 
RAM QUARTERBACK ATTACKS JIM ROME AFTER BEING CALLED 'CHRIS EVERT' DURING AN 
ESPN2 INTERVIEW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY and T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Ram quarterback Jim Everett, upset by comments made by ESPN2 talk show 
host Jim Rome during a live interview Wednesday night, attacked Rome in the 
network's Hollywood studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett became upset when Rome repeatedly called him "Chris Evert," a 
reference to the female tennis star and Everett's questionable courage to take 
a hit, during an interview on "Talk 2." Everett shoved a table between them 
away and knocked Rome backward off his chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett then jumped on Rome. No punches appeared to be thrown, and they were 
separated by studio workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rome said he was not injured in the incident and that Everett did not 
apologize afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't directly apologize to me, but he seemed remorseful," Rome said. "He 
said as he left, 'I've had to put up with this stuff for three years in L.A., 
and I just snapped.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Everett, traded by the Rams to the New Orleans Saints March 18 for a 
seventh-round draft pick in 1995, was unavailable for comment Wednesday night, 
but told a Las Vegas television station, "I can't believe ESPN did this and I 
expect a full apology." 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Demoff, Everett's agent, said he didn't see the incident or speak with 
Everett about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand what it accomplishes," Demoff said. "I'm not defending Jim 
and I don't know the circumstances, but why ask him to come on a show to 
humiliate him, and expect that as proper? 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand it's different if you've been forewarned -- I can accept that. 
But I find it totally offensive of Rome." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett's confrontation with Rome was one of a handful of incidents he has had 
with the media last season. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, Everett told a reporter he was " . . . ridiculous" for asking 
him if he would be the Rams' starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, after Everett had been pulled from the starting lineup in favor 
of backup T.J. Rubley, the quarterback challenged the same reporter to a fight, 
saying "let's go somewhere and settle this like men." 
</P>
<P>
 Reports from New York last fall quoted some of Everett's Ram teammates 
referring to the quarterback as "Chris Evert," for his lack of courage to take 
a hit, although no local reporters quoted any players saying that. 
</P>
<P>
 Rome, noted for his good-natured jousting with athletes and coaches during his 
interviews, had repeatedly referred to Everett as "Chris" or "Chrissie" on his 
XTRA radio show and his ESPN2 talk show. He said an ESPN producer warned 
Everett twice before the interview that Rome would refer to him as "Chris" at 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, we felt very unfortunate (about the incident)," Rome said. "We were 
looking forward to the interview, talking about his Ram days, his Purdue days 
and his future in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our producer had called Jim in Las Vegas and asked him if he had any problems 
being called Chris Evert. The producer said we wanted him to be comfortable. If 
he didn't feel comfortable, then he shouldn't come. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everett told him (the producer) 'I got some things I want to say about my Ram 
days, and this will be a good opportunity.' The producer advised him that I 
won't pull any punches. He (Everett) knew everything." 
</P>
<P>
 But Everett became upset with the reference after Rome questioned him about 
the quarterback's "Phantom Sack" in the Rams' 31-3 loss to the San Francisco 
49ers in the 1990 NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett: "You better take a station break. You (Rome) have been talking behind 
my back." 
</P>
<P>
 Rome: "Well, now I'm saying it." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett: "I bet you won't say it again." 
</P>
<P>
 Rome did. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett, 6 feet 5 and 212 pounds, placed his hand on the round table 
separating them, pushed it away and jumped at Rome. The network then cut away, 
but returned later to Rome, who said: "Hated for something like that to happen. 
But that's that."

THE MASTERS; NORMAN IS ONE TO BEAT; GOLF: HE HAS BEEN PLAYING SO WELL, IT MIGHT 
BE HIS TIME TO END AUGUSTA JINX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHERWA, TIMES DEPUTY SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ball was 140 feet from the hole when it started its remarkable journey. It 
skipped on the fringe and rolled for 30 feet before finding its way to the 
bottom of the cup. It was 1987 and the defining moment in the Masters career of 
Greg Norman. 
</P>
<P>
 And it wasn't even his shot. It belonged to Larry Mize, the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 One year earlier, Norman found himself on the 18th green with a chance to tie 
Jack Nicklaus and break the hearts of anyone who ever cared about golf. Norman 
missed the putt. 
</P>
<P>
 And in 1989, it was the 18th hole and Norman had put himself in position to 
finish in a three-way playoff. Again, he missed the putt. History does repeat 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Norman, who has shown equal doses of temper and talent, has returned once 
again to the cathedral known as Augusta National in hopes of exorcising his 
ghosts of failure. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Norman is the big favorite -- if golf can have such a creature -- 
playing the most brilliant golf in years. The timing is right, considering the 
Masters, the first of the Grand Slam tournaments, begins a four-day run today. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, he embarrassed the Tournament Players Championship course at 
Ponte Vedra, Fla., with a record 24-under-par score. In his 19 starts since the 
U.S. Open, he has won five times, finished in the top four 11 times and in the 
top 10 17 times. Along that stretch, he won the British Open and lost in a 
playoff at the PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take being favored as a big compliment," Norman said. "It means you're 
playing well. It adds no pressure. I put all the pressure on myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Norman won't talk about his past problems, saying: "I made a decision not to 
talk about those things." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor will he talk about 1991, when his career crashed and he finished 51st on 
the money list, one year after finishing first. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman says he has found inner peace and confidence. Of course, finding inner 
peace and confidence is a lot easier when you're shooting the lights out. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman attributes his grand roll partly to a newfound interest in Bruce Lee 
and martial arts. He says the book "Zen of the Martial Arts" has changed him. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of similarities between golf and martial arts," the 
39-year-old Australian said. "I'm not kicking things. I'm just doing it from 
the mental side, not the physical side." 
</P>
<P>
 Norman says he wants to shade his once tempestuous personality to the 
unemotional side. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a big difference between the agony of defeat and the ecstasy of 
victory," he said. "The idea is to stay in the gray area in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
 If Norman were to win his first Masters, it is doubtful he'll be able to stay 
in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to think that this is Greg's year," said Johnny Miller, who is 
trying to figure out if he's a player or a television announcer. "He's much 
more relaxed than I've ever seen him. His mind and his game are ready to win 
the close ones. He's reached a new level." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's victory at Pebble Beach this year is more likely a blip on his career 
rather than a trend. The substantive competition here should come mostly from 
foreign players. 
</P>
<P>
 England's Nick Faldo and Zimbabwe's Nick Price are given the best chances to 
top Norman. And last year's champion, Bernhard Langer of Germany, a two-time 
winner, can't be counted out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Greg and Nick Price hit the ball very far," Langer said. "I've always 
wondered why Greg hasn't won here." 
</P>
<P>
 The top Americans are Davis Love III and Corey Pavin, winner of the L.A. Open. 
However, Pavin's lack of distance off the tee will hurt his chances.  
</P>
<P>
 Missing are Fred Couples (back), Paul Azinger (cancer) and Phil Mickelson 
(broken ankle). 
</P>
<P>
 "I've played with Jeff Maggert and he's putting well," Faldo said, adding a 
name to the mix. "He could be a dark horse for the Americans. And Tom Kite 
always plays well here." 
</P>
<P>
 Another golfer to watch is Fuzzy Zoeller, who has finished second in his last 
three tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you knock on the door long enough, the door will open," said Zoeller, the 
1979 champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Masters veterans say that players do nothing but jockey for position through 
the first 63 holes and that the real tournament doesn't start until the back 
nine on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoeller, who was chastised Tuesday for signing autographs on the course, looks 
at the tournament this way: 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to like both Nickies (Faldo and Price) and Woosie (Ian Woosnam) and 
Bernie (Langer) and Sharkie (Norman). You can't overlook him. You can't 
overlook anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Zoeller, when pressed, could eliminate only one person from contention in the 
Masters, a tournament that gives its past winners a lifetime exemption to play, 
regardless of age. Many still play a few holes for tradition's sake, then drop 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, Byron (Nelson, 80) was telling me he hits a five-iron 120 yards," Zoeller 
said. "So he'd better have some long tee shots. He's having trouble moving the 
weight to his left side through his artificial hip."

JIM MURRAY: GENTLE TOUCH WINS OVER FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When he putts, nobody in the gallery secretly mouths to himself, "Miss it!" If 
he hits the ball in the rough, everybody groans. When a red number goes up next 
to his name, the crowd cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has ever seen him throw a club, kick a ball-washer, snarl at a marshal 
or a spectator. In pro-ams, he helps the auto dealers line up their putts. The 
press likes him. He yields to no one in his knowledge and affection for the 
history of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game where nicknames run to "the Hawk," "the Shark," "the Slammer," "the 
Bear" or "Boom Boom," he's "Gentle Ben." That should tell you all you have to 
know about Ben Crenshaw. He loves the game, and it loves him. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, at least the people around the game do. As for the game itself, it 
frequently treats Ben Crenshaw the way that waitress treats her lovesick 
admirer in "Of Human Bondage." She kicks him around something awful, but no 
matter what she does, how she mocks him, taunts him, cheats on him, he keeps 
coming back for more. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, that's what golf does to Ben Crenshaw. Torment him. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ben Crenshaw came out on the tour 20 years ago, the game thought it had 
the logical successor to Ben Hogan. Even his stature was similar, 5 feet 9. He 
had won three NCAA championships in a row; he played in a U.S. Open when he was 
only 18. He played the bold, take-no-prisoners, what-trees? game of an Arnold 
Palmer. He had the longest swing and the highest finish in the game.  
</P>
<P>
 He was fun to watch. The ball went far. It didn't always go straight. Ben 
probably led the tour in out-of-bounds shots. He also led it in one-putts. They 
thought that as soon as he found a way to keep the ball between the white 
markers, he would make the world forget that other Ben. 
</P>
<P>
 But golf is as resistant to conquest as China. Many a shining young player 
disappears into its interior never to be heard from again. Crenshaw didn't 
disappear, but there were times search parties were sent out. 
</P>
<P>
 The consensus was, he tried too hard. No one had more respect for the game. No 
one had to tell Ben Crenshaw what a British Open victory, or what a Masters or 
a U.S. Open meant. He never laid up with a major on the line. He was the Arnold 
Toynbee of golf history. He knew every shot Bobby Jones hit. He could tell you 
what club Hogan used on the 18th or from where Gene Sarazen hit his 
double-eagle. 
</P>
<P>
 But golf is not a kingdom any more. It's a rabble. A winner a week. Guys were 
not making history any more, only money.  
</P>
<P>
 So, Crenshaw didn't become king of the hill. But neither did anyone else. What 
he did become was the most popular player in the game. When he won his Masters 
in 1984, every golf fan in the country felt as if he himself had won it. When 
Crenshaw hit it over a green, they felt like kicking a ball-washer for him. 
</P>
<P>
 His popularity was worldwide. When he finished second in a British Open one 
year, cabdrivers in the airport were calling out to him, "Shoulda been yours, 
Ben!" 
</P>
<P>
 He became famous for his putting stroke, which was as smooth as hot fudge over 
whipped cream, but it overshadowed the rest of his game unfairly. A good 
putting stroke is a waste if you don't reach the green in time. 
</P>
<P>
 He won his 18th tour event at New Orleans last week with a putting exhibition 
that was right out of Lourdes. It was so good that no one noticed Crenshaw's 
shots were never in the water -- or even on the wrong side of the fairway -- 
for 72 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at 42, Crenshaw still projects the image of everybody's kid brother. He 
should play with a puppy dog following him. It wouldn't be too hard to picture 
him as a member of an Our Gang comedy playing in high-top sneakers with 
hand-me-down clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone wants to win the Masters. But for Crenshaw, it has been an obsession. 
He has been second in three British Opens. But in the Masters, he has been 
second four times. He has been third once and fourth twice. In 22 appearances, 
he has been out of the top 20 only six times. 
</P>
<P>
 No one ever cherished the green jacket more than Ben Crenshaw. He's like 
Somerset Maugham's character, the more the Masters rebuffs him, the more he 
wants her. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, this is a course that beats you back," Crenshaw says. "With all the 
development of new equipment and all the refinements, you still find holes you 
can't play. The Masters is somewhat of a check on technology. The undulations 
of the greens are the heart and soul of this course, and they blunt your 
attack. I came here first in 1972 and fell in love with the course. I still am. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greens are Bobby Jones' persona. He has laid out the course with what he 
referred to as 'imminent danger' and 'deferred danger.' Nowhere does your short 
game feel such severe pressure. Playing the Masters is a little like playing 
billiards. You try to 'leave' balls in certain spots. You can't play it without 
imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Gentle Ben is in the grip of devotion to this elusive mistress. But 
it's not blind love. He is conscious of all her tricks of rejection. It just 
makes him all the fonder. But if she spurns him again, the heart she breaks 
won't be only his. It will be every golf fan in a locker room anywhere and 
cause the greatest weeping and gnashing of teeth since Arnold Palmer butchered 
the 18th hole and lost to Gary Player in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 But it won't matter to Ben. He'll be back next year with flowers in hand and a 
box of candy under the arm and hope in his heart. He's hopelessly in love with 
the fickle girl.

ANALYSIS; THE STRAWBERRY SITUATION IS FAR FROM FINISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid speculation that Darryl Strawberry's admission Monday of a drug problem 
is a ploy to escape being released by the Dodgers, his attorney, Bob Shapiro, 
said Wednesday that the doctors who examined Strawberry have determined he has 
a serious drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "After an extensive evaluation of Darryl, the (doctors) have come to the 
conclusion that he has a serious substance abuse problem and that his frame of 
mind is such that he is amenable to treatment," Shapiro said.  
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry was evaluated in New York by two doctors -- one representing major 
league baseball and the other the players' union -- and is expected to enter a 
treatment facility by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can confirm that the doctors believed that Darryl needs treatment and he 
will beentering an institution. However, I will not disclose the site," said 
Gene Orza, general counsel for the players' union. "The reason for his 
institutionalism is not alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry's admission places many of his key issues in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Dodgers, who have tired of Strawberry's continual involvement in 
controversial situations, were admittedly on the verge of releasing him after 
he failed to show up in Anaheim on Sunday for the team's final spring game. 
They said the excuse he gave the club -- which still has not been disclosed -- 
was unacceptable, but it did not constitute a violation of the good behavior 
clause in his contract.  
</P>
<P>
 If the Dodgers had released Strawberry, they would still have to pay him the 
$8 million they own him the next two seasons. But they were prepared to release 
him anyway, then search Strawberry's contract for a way to void it. 
</P>
<P>
 This organization, though, seldom denies treatment to anyone, and it would be 
poor public relations for them to release a player who is seeking help. That 
doesn't mean that at the end of Strawberry's treatment the Dodgers won't cut 
him loose -- unless they can trade him -- and take the loss, because to void 
Strawberry's contract will involve a difficult fight with the players' union.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers have an additional morals clause written into Strawberry's 
contract, but their case would need to be fortified by something more concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The two legal issues Strawberry is facing have also been complicated since 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A grand jury in New York is continuing to hear testimony concerning 
Strawberry's alleged failure to report income of $300,000 received from 
baseball card shows from 1987-90. The investigation, by the IRS and U.S. 
attorney's office in White Plains, N.Y., has been ongoing for more than a year 
and includes other baseball players, but Strawberry is the biggest name. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been speculated that an indictment would come down around the April 15 
tax deadline -- a practice by the IRS with high-profile defendants -- but 
indicting a man in a drug treatment center weakens the case. Insiders also say 
that any indictment is months away because of the steps Strawberry's attorneys 
are entitled to before a judgment is rendered. 
</P>
<P>
 The current situation might slow the IRS, but it won't stop it. The 
investigation has been so widespread that the IRS flew a former inmate of the 
Lompoc Federal Penitentiary to New York to testify. The inmate, a former 
mortgage broker, testified that while arranging a loan for Strawberry on a 
house in Encino, Strawberry opened a safe inside his house and showed him 
stacks of cash, worth six figures. "The Grand Jury flew (the witness) to New 
York in July (1993) and then talked with him again later on," said a 
well-placed source. "When he got back from testifying, he said he was able to 
give the grand jury what they needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Gelfand, Strawberry's tax attorney, said that he had no comment on the 
testimony.  
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry has denied the IRS charge, saying that he relied on his agent and 
accountant to handle the reporting of his income. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A case involving an altercation last April with an alleged homeless man is 
still active, but deposing Strawberry now presents a problem for Ronald 
Whiteman, the attorney who is representing Robert Whited.

 Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president, said that though he had 
suspected a drug problem with Strawberry, things had gone so well during spring 
training, he was not concerned. The only time Strawberry reported late was 
after he returned from a trip to Los Angeles about three weeks ago, when he was 
visiting his newborn son. But he was not more than a half-hour late, and that 
day he played his best game. 
</P>
<P>
 What Claire did find strange was the story Strawberry told for being late -- 
that his limousine broke down on the way to Vero Beach, Fla., from the Orlando 
airport, and he had to spend the night in the car. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports concerning Strawberry continue to fly. Some say Strawberry fooled 
the club by never returning to Los Angeles to see his son, instead staying in 
Florida, but Manager Tom Lasorda's wife, Jo, sat next to Strawberry during the 
entire nonstop flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Lisa Strawberry, Strawberry's former wife, has been affected. After 
Monday's news of Strawberry's admission, a tip surfaced that a car owned by 
Lisa had been seized last week in Encino by the Drug Enforcement Agency, 
because it was involved in an alleged drug transaction in St. Louis. The LAPD 
Narcotics Division confirmed they assisted the U.S. Marshals in the seizure. 
Lisa Strawberry was not arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers might hope to go on without Strawberry, but the situation will 
continue to plague them as long as he is associated with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Lasorda said he has had it with the subject. "I'm through talking about 
Darryl" Lasorda said. "No more. I have a team to think about."

HEAVY METAL FAN SHOWS METTLE ON MOUND; BASEBALL: LOS AMIGOS GRADUATE ANDY WISE 
IS PROVING HE BELONGS IN BULLPEN AT LONG BEACH STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sound of wailing guitars in Black Sabbath's "Iron Man" arrive just about 
the time Long Beach State relief pitcher Andy Wise leaves the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 Tired of the pop music and twang of country and western tunes on the 49ers' 
public address system at home games, Wise dubbed his own tape and begged for 
some air time. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in the process, he has turned Blair Field into his own headbanger's ball. 
Bullpen style. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great," he said. "Even when we're on the road, some of the guys in the 
dugout will start singing it when I come into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, duh-dun dun-dun-dun . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 You get the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a fitting choice of music, this Iron Man, for a guy whose mettle has been 
tested more than once in this sport. 
</P>
<P>
 It was tested at Los Amigos High, where Wise played for a 5-15 team his senior 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 It was tested at Rancho Santiago, where Coach Don Sneddon cut him as a 
freshman, then invited him back and moved him from catcher to the bullpen. He 
overcame nagging shoulder problems, changed his pitching motion to a sidearm 
delivery and relished the thankless role of a middle relief pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 And it has been tested at Long Beach State, where Coach Dave Snow brought him 
in as a walk-on and used him as a set-up man for Gabe Gonzalez, one of the top 
collegiate closers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you would have told me years ago that Andy Wise would one day pitch for 
Long Beach in the College World Series," Sneddon said, "I would have asked you 
to take a drug test." 
</P>
<P>
 But that was Wise standing on the mound at Omaha's Rosenblatt Stadium last 
June, pitching in a mop-up role in Long Beach State's 7-1 first-round loss to 
top-ranked Louisiana State in the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Wise's only appearance in the double-elimination tournament, and it was 
the kind of duty a middle reliever hates -- entering a game trailing by six 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody heard Wise complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was all the cortisone shots he once had to take in his right 
(pitching) shoulder, then all the rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was the 16,953 fans who watched that game, or the kids who hung 
around the bullpen, calling out his name. Or maybe it was the thought of his 
1-year-old son, Tyler, back home in California. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wise, this was why you played college baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "How lucky can I get?" he asks. "I could have easily quit, but I always 
thought I could play at this level." 
</P>
<P>
 It just took him awhile to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 Unrecruited out of high school, Wise came to Rancho Santiago hoping that his 
hitting would earn him a spot in the lineup. Sneddon took a long look but cut 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Wise didn't listen. He kept coming around the ballpark, a habit that caught 
Sneddon's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most guys would have hung it up and been flipping burgers by now," Sneddon 
said. "But he's a self-made player, the working man's idol. He doesn't have a 
lot of God-given talent, but his story is the kind you would like to see on 
film." 
</P>
<P>
 Sneddon asked Wise to sit out a season as a redshirt. Then he handed him a 
ball and sent him to the bullpen. The kid stood only six feet and his fastball 
wouldn't break the speed limit on most freeways, but Wise still showed promise 
as a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was throwing overhead, not following through on my pitches," Wise said. 
"Then I was working with (pitching coach Jim) Reach one day and I noticed this 
one pitcher dropped down with his motion. So I decided to give it a try." 
</P>
<P>
 His sidearm delivery forces hitters into groundouts, a must for a relief 
pitcher. And it also might have helped prolong his pitching career. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he wasn't trying to throw as hard as he used to, the small muscle 
tears that developed in his shoulder before his sophomore year weren't getting 
any worse than they already were. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the injury, Wise had modest success, finishing 2-1 with three saves 
and a 2.45 earned-run average as Rancho Santiago won the Orange Empire 
Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "my arm was done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He had arthroscopic surgery right after the season, and only hoped that a 
Division I college was willing to take a chance with him. San Diego State and 
Fresno State showed interest early, but backed off because of his arm problems. 
</P>
<P>
 After Wise's surgery, Sneddon asked him where he would like to play. Wise told 
him Long Beach State or Cal State Fullerton. He wanted to stay close to home, 
close to his son and his girlfriend, Teri. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to play for a good baseball school," Wise said, "but staying near 
Tyler was very, very important." 
</P>
<P>
 Sneddon lobbied Snow to take Wise as a walk-on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw him pitch only a couple innings in the fall," Snow said, "I took him 
entirely on Sneddon's opinion. He told me Andy would be a key guy for us out of 
the bullpen." 
</P>
<P>
 And he has, but it has taken time. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the attention goes to Gonzalez -- or "Blade" as he is known to his 
teammates. Gonzalez saved 13 games with 50 strikeouts in 53 innings last season 
and was named to the first time All-Big West. Wise, still battling a sore 
shoulder, was 2-1 with no saves and a 5.09 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Gonzalez is among the nation's leaders with nine saves. And Wise, 
whose shoulder hasn't felt better since high school, is 1-0 with one save and a 
1.26 ERA in 28 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you do a good job (as a middle reliever) people will tell you," Wise 
said. "You lose a game, and you're the goat. You do well, and the other guy 
gets the save. But that's fine. That's the way it is, and I understand that." 
</P>
<P>
 It's an easy role to accept, especially when you're playing for the 
seventh-ranked team in Collegiate Baseball's rankings. A good showing against 
top-ranked Cal State Fullerton this weekend at Blair Field, and the 49ers will 
be considered serious national title contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have much more talent than last year," Wise said. "We haven't played well, 
but we're still 23-7 and we're right about where we want to be." 
</P>
<P>
 And if all goes as planned, Wise just might be packing his Black Sabbath tape 
in June for another trip to that baseball mecca known as Omaha, Neb. With a 
little playing time, Wise's heavy metal might just liven up a city known for 
two kinds of music -- country and western . 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I worked all summer and all fall to make it back to the College World 
Series," he said. "And this time, I want to make more than a minor 
contribution."

FIGURE SKATING; ZAYAK BOLDLY MOVES BACK INTO PROMINENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is not uncommon for figure skaters to receive standing ovations after 
performing their freestyle programs in competitions. Elaine Zayak received one 
before she began hers at the national championships last January in Detroit, 
where the challenge of recapturing past glory is appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 When Zayak returned to training 11 months earlier at her practice rink in 
Monsey, N.Y., she was 27, at least 20 pounds overweight and had not entered a 
serious competition in nine years. When she left Detroit, she was perhaps the 
proudest fourth-place finisher in the sport's history. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus encouraged, she will continue her comeback in the Hershey's Kisses Pro-Am 
that begins tonight at the Sports Arena. Zayak, who turns 29 next week, will 
attempt to upset 13-year-old Michelle Kwan of Torrance, who had not celebrated 
her first birthday when Zayak won the national title in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Zayak's re-emergence is no more improbable than her emergence. Although she 
lost part of her left foot in a lawn mower accident when she was 2, she became 
such a bold and energetic jumper that figure skating officials changed their 
rules to harness her. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the sport's first blue-collar heroines, identified on billboards in her 
New Jersey hometown as "The Pride of Paramus," she was only 16 when she became 
the world champion in 1982 after landing seven triple jumps, unprecedented at 
that time for women.  
</P>
<P>
 But her star fell as rapidly as it had risen, and by the winter of 1984, when 
she was sixth in the Sarajevo Winter Olympics, she was 18 going on 65, time to 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
 Her spontaneous smile, as much her trademark as her triple toe jumps, did not 
return during a short, unsatisfying professional career, and all most people 
within the sport knew about her for the next few years was that she had bought 
into a delicatessen in Ridgewood, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the Ridgewood Gourmet Deli," she said by telephone last week, easily 
identifiable by her high, little girl's voice and thick New Jersey accent. 
"What made it gourmet was the stuffed cabbage I made the Slovakian way from my 
grandmother's recipe." 
</P>
<P>
 Zayak still swears by her stuffed cabbage, but not the restaurant business. 
</P>
<P>
 She was seeking a new career when she discovered an old one. 
</P>
<P>
 After the International Skating Union adopted a rule in 1992 that allowed 
professionals to regain their eligibility, Zayak filled out an application the 
next February and sent it to the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 To report that USFSA officials did not take her seriously is an 
understatement, but even Zayak was not sure how seriously she wanted to be 
taken.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I heard the announcement that I was coming back on TV, I said, 'Oh my 
God, does that mean I really have to do this?' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She told her coaches, Peter Burrows and Mary-Lynn Gelderman, that her only 
goal was to lose weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just mush," said Zayak, who confesses now to having put on those 20 
unwanted pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told us she had 30 pounds to lose," Gelderman said. "We said, 'Oh really? 
In which leg?' 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't surprised that she said she wanted to give it a shot. But we 
didn't think she was capable of coming back and competing with the youngsters. 
We were placating her at that point." 
</P>
<P>
 When Zayak realized no one -- not even her own coaches -- believed in her, her 
goal changed. Her comeback no longer was only a substitute for a diet. She 
became determined to prove the doubters wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people thought it was too late for me, and that became another 
motivation," she said. "The more people who said I couldn't do it, the more I 
wanted to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The USFSA did not assign Zayak to any of the various international events last 
fall or winter that U.S. competitors use to fine-tune their programs for the 
national championships, believing that it would not be fair if she took the 
place of younger skaters who had been participating in the sport without 
interruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Zayak, however, was invited to a competition in Vienna by organizers who 
thought she would be good for the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was going to be great," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She was not, failing to land even one triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
 "She jumped in the water, found it was deep and panicked," Gelderman said. "I 
thought she would say, 'All right, that's it. At least, I have my body back.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Zayak headed straight for a telephone, called New York and entered a 
small competition that would be held there five days later. 
</P>
<P>
 "That changed my mind about her," Gelderman said. "At that point, I really 
started to respect her tenacity." 
</P>
<P>
 When Zayak skated onto the ice for her freestyle program in Detroit, as 
effervescent -- and almost as slim -- as she had been in her last national 
championships in 1984, she was 116 pounds of good news for a sport that needed 
some after the assault two days earlier on defending champion Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 The capacity crowd at Joe Louis Arena was on its feet as soon as her name was 
announced and again after she performed a vibrant, almost flawless four-minute 
program that included four triple jumps. It was not technically as demanding as 
the programs performed by many of the other women, but through the tears, the 
fourth-place scores awarded her by the judges seemed to her like perfect 6.0s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've loved Elaine since I first began coaching her when she was 11, but I 
never respected her as much as I did that night," Gelderman said. "She worked 
harder for that fourth place than she did for all of her national and world 
championships medals." 
</P>
<P>
 Will Zayak return for next year's national championships? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe I'm saying this, but I think it's a possibility," Gelderman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zayak's agent, Michael Rosenberg of Palm Desert, said she has numerous 
options, including perhaps a tour that would open in September with Olympic 
women's champion Oksana Baiul of Ukraine and world men's champion Elvis Stojko 
of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "Elaine was yesterday's news for a long time," Rosenberg said. "But 12 years 
after she won her world title, she all of a sudden comes back as a bright face 
on the American skating scene. I've never seen anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about her future, Zayak would say only that she would like to compete in 
another international event later this year. She is planning to add another 
triple jump to her repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to go out like I did last time, not feeling good about my 
skating," she said. "I want to go out on top." 
</P>
<P>
 If she does not enter the 1995 national championships, it will not be because 
U.S. figure skating officials discouraged her. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," she agreed, "they're being very nice to me now."

BRITISH PULL OUT OF MATCH ON HITLER'S BIRTHDAY; SOCCER: ENGLISH FOOTBALL ASSN. 
CANCELS GAME SCHEDULED FOR APRIL 20 IN BERLIN ON GROUNDS THAT IT WOULD ATTRACT 
NEO-FASCIST ELEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A controversial soccer match scheduled between the British and German national 
teams in Berlin on Adolf Hitler's birthday was called off Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The game, which was to have been played on April 20, was canceled by the 
English Football Assn. on the grounds that it would attract neo-Fascist 
elements from Britain and Germany, and perhaps from elsewhere in Europe, to the 
stadium built by Hitler for the 1936 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
 German soccer authorities were furious over the cancellation, declaring that 
it played into the hands of far-right-wing groups by showing their power to 
stop a game between soccer superpowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany is the current World Cup holder, and the game was considered an 
important warm-up before Germany defends its title this summer in the United 
States. England's soccer team is still enduring the humiliation of not having 
qualified for the 1994 World Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports commentators in Britain said late Wednesday it seemed inexplicable that 
the "friendly" match had been scheduled for a day recognized as the birth date 
of Hitler, who was born in 1889. 
</P>
<P>
 A friendly match is one played outside of competition for qualification for 
the World Cup or the European Championship, each held every four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Sir Bert Millichip, F.A. chairman, confirmed in announcing the decision that 
government intelligence reports indicated the match could be the focus for both 
right-wing and left-wing demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been fully aware of the risk of disorder for the past few months," he 
said Wednesday, "but we had hoped that those risks might recede. Unfortunately, 
they have not, and it was the executive committee's decision that those risks 
were too high." 
</P>
<P>
 Millichip said British authorities had offered the Germans a change of venue 
to Wembley Stadium in London, but this was declined. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad news, but I do feel that in the circumstances, it's the correct 
decision," British Coach Terry Venables said. 
</P>
<P>
 A new date for the match -- dubbed the "Hitler match" by the British press -- 
has not been set. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham Kelly, the F.A. chief executive, denied that his organization had 
handed a victory to the neo-Fascist organizations. "We understand that 
viewpoint," he said. "But in our opinion, even small risks are too great." 
</P>
<P>
 In Germany, former team manager Franz Beckenbauer said he agreed with the 
"sensible" decision. 
</P>
<P>
 But the decision came as a slap in the face to Berlin's sports and security 
authorities. Before the decision, Egidius Braun, president of the German 
Football Assn., had declared: "We are not going to chicken out. If we 
capitulate, the negative consequences for the sport and society would be 
far-reaching." 
</P>
<P>
 The match was originally scheduled for Hamburg, but that city, realizing the 
implications of the date, pulled out, and Berlin offered to stage the game 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 German neo-Nazis already had been calling their members to arms with the 
slogan: "The Battle of the Century." And a pro-Nazi rally was reportedly 
scheduled for April 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Leftists smashed windows and threw acid into the offices of the Berlin soccer 
authority two weeks ago.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; NO INTERPRETER FOR PARK DURING GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dodgers know where they want Chan Ho Park to be. Don Yi, they are not so 
sure of. 
</P>
<P>
 Park, the rookie right-hander from South Korea, will be on the mound quite a 
bit this season if he lives up to the promise he has shown thus far. 
</P>
<P>
 But because Park has difficulty speaking English, Yi, a computer engineer who 
lives locally, has been recruited to serve as Park's interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 That's fine for pregame and postgame situations. But during the game, Park is 
on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to try to get along without him (Yi)," Manager Tom Lasorda said. 
"We have to. We can't have him out there."

<P>
 Certainly not on the mound or in the bullpen. For now, Yi, who wears a uniform 
and works out with the team before the game, sits in the clubhouse once the 
first pitch is thrown. 
</P>
<P>
 And where would he like to sit? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a preference," said Yi, then adding, "I would like to be 
pitching."

 For the first two games of this home stand, four members of a Korean 
television station based in Seoul and about 15 local Korean journalists have 
been on hand to follow Park. . . . Backup catcher Carlos Hernandez won't be 
going on the disabled list after all. Hernandez experienced a lot of discomfort 
Monday after straining his lower back while running before the season opener. 
"It wasn't looking too good (Monday) night," he said. "Big pain. But the 
trainers did a great job." Hernandez took batting practice Tuesday and declared 
himself available for duty. STEVE SPRINGER

KLOSTERMAN, LEBARON APPLY TO RUN HOLLYPARK CARD CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A couple of former quarterbacks, Don Klosterman and Eddie LeBaron, have 
applied to the state's department of gaming registration for a lease to operate 
the card-playing club at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Klosterman, who played football at Loyola before his professional career was 
ended by a skiing accident, and Don Robbins, the president of Hollywood Park, 
confirmed the application Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 LeBaron, who played at College of the Pacific before joining the Washington 
Redskins to begin a long pro career, is a lawyer in Sacramento. Klosterman, a 
former general manager of the Rams, served 10 years on Hollywood Park's board 
of directors.  
</P>
<P>
 The card club is expected to open this year. Because of its status as a 
corporation, Hollywood Park is prevented by state law from operating the club. 
</P>
<P>
 The application comes after the state attorney general's office disapproved an 
application by Ed Allred and Haig Kellegian because Allred had previously owned 
stock in out-of-state gambling businesses. BILL CHRISTINE

SCIENCE COURSE; 'PROFESSOR' LU BRINGS TECHNICAL APPROACH TO CSUN VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The year was 1987 and Lian Kang Lu could not believe what he was hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lu, then an assistant women's volleyball coach at UC Santa Barbara, had asked 
David Rottman, an All-American outside hitter on the Gaucho men's team, to 
explain the proper hitting technique for a cross-court kill. 
</P>
<P>
 Rottman was unable, despite having blasted thousands of cross-court kills 
during his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said it was just something he did," Lu said with a chuckle. "He said he 
had never thought about it, he had just done it." 
</P>
<P>
 To Lu, who took over the women's volleyball program at Cal State Northridge 
this year, such a statement would be considered a sacrilege. 
</P>
<P>
 Lu, one of the top technical coaches in the world who is affectionately known 
as "The Professor," says there is a correct technique for everything a player 
does -- serving, passing, setting, spiking, blocking or defense. Nothing is 
just done . 
</P>
<P>
 In a similar vein, he maintains that for every offensive action that occurs 
during a match, there is a proper defensive reaction. Call it Lu's theory of 
volleyball relativity. 
</P>
<P>
 Volleyball might seem simple, but Lu treats it as science. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing is as simple as it appears for Lu, 59, a founder of the South China 
volleyball training base that produced women's teams that won World Cup titles 
in 1981 and '85, the Olympic Games in 1984 and the World Championships in 1982 
and '86. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiking might seem like a straightforward task, but Lu has designed 
instructional charts that list 20 different ways to hit the ball. "The type of 
options you use will depend on the strengths and weaknesses of the team you are 
playing," Lu said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, even if a player grasps the myriad techniques Lu teaches, that 
player must put the knowledge to use in the heat of competition, when 
split-second decisions are required. 
</P>
<P>
 That is where Lu's detailed training regimen comes into play. 
</P>
<P>
 Having broken volleyball into six basic components -- serving, passing, 
setting, spiking, blocking and defense -- Lu's training revolves around his 
belief that a player must be competent in what he calls main skills areas 
before advancing to auxiliary skills and top skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I teach is like a little block, and it takes many, many blocks to 
make up a big building," Lu said. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Heather Anderson, who has been a starting outside hitter at Northridge 
for the past two seasons, has already noticed the training differences between 
Lu and Matador predecessors Walt Ker -- who coached the team from 1979-92 -- 
and John Price (1993). 
</P>
<P>
 "We practice a lot more without the balls," Anderson said. "We do a lot more 
footwork and wrist work than we did before. We do a lot more agility drills 
where you get to know how your body moves. . . . Before, we just went out and 
played, but now we know exactly what we're going to do on any given play." 
</P>
<P>
 As an intense, vocal and demonstrative coach, Lu, who coached at Santa Barbara 
from 1984 through 1993, has been known to lose his cool every now and then. But 
UC Santa Barbara junior Chrissy Boehle says that "99% of the time, his coaching 
is very positive." 
</P>
<P>
 "He gets angry," Boehle said. "He gets upset at times, but it's usually done 
in a very positive way." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson says that criticism is applied in a very direct and forthright 
manner.  
</P>
<P>
 "He is very on the table with everything," she said. "He lets you know what 
your strengths are and what your weaknesses are right from the start." 
</P>
<P>
 Lu is equally candid with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked his first impressions of a Northridge team that compiled a 12-17 record 
last season, he said: "Blocking is our strength. Defense is our weakness. The 
girls are working very hard, but they have a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Lu's ability to physically demonstrate what he wants done on the court could 
be one of his greatest assets as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is a month away from his 60th birthday, Lu is in superb physical 
condition and takes pride in demonstrating the proper technique for a belly 
slide, a sprawl, a roll or a half-roll after digging a ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "My age is old, but I don't like people to know about it," he laughs. "Forget 
my age. Remember my shape and great demonstrations." 
</P>
<P>
 A need to illustrate exactly what he wants done is not the sole reason for 
Lu's adherence to a daily training regimen. He is convinced that an energetic 
coach can elevate a team's play to another level. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't have energy, your team will be down," he said. "But if you have 
a lot of energy, a weak team can be good and a good team can be great." 
</P>
<P>
 Lu said his assertive personality and upbeat manner are products of a 
demanding childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest of five children, he was born in Shanghai on May 4, 1934. 
Although his parents were employed, Lu said his family was very poor and that 
"life in China was very hard." 
</P>
<P>
 "Being very poor made me strong-willed, outgoing and aggressive," he said. "I 
have to be that way to get what I want." 
</P>
<P>
 As a multitalented athlete who competed in volleyball, basketball, soccer, 
gymnastics and table tennis, Lu spent much of his childhood living with friends 
because "their parents liked the fact that I could teach their children 
sports." 
</P>
<P>
 Like millions of his countrymen, however, Lu's life was altered dramatically 
in the aftermath of the Chinese civil war, which pitted the Communist forces of 
Mao Tse-tung against Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist army. 
</P>
<P>
 The war began in 1946 -- shortly after World War II and China's liberation 
from Japanese rule -- and ended in 1949 when the Communists defeated the 
nationalists and drove Chiang Kai-shek and his supporters to the island of 
Taiwan, where they established Nationalist China. 
</P>
<P>
 Lu's father and sister had been living in Taiwan during the war because 
economic opportunities there were better, but in the aftermath, travel between 
the island and the new People's Republic of China became severely limited and 
remained that way until the early part of this decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Lu's parents never saw each other again -- his mother died in 1976, his father 
in 1991 -- and he and his three brothers never saw their father again. 
</P>
<P>
 Lu and his sister, Jin, were reunited in 1992 after 43 years, yet he seems to 
take solace in the fact that a separation like theirs was commonplace in 
postwar China. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very sad, very tough for our family," Lu said. "But a lot of families 
were like us. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, went through the same 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the civil war ended, Lu turned his athletic attention to 
volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a setter on the city of Beijing's professional team for most of the 
1960s and played on the national team several times during that period. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1968-81, he coached the Beijing women's team, and in 1982 and 1983, he 
coached the Mexican women's national team after being encouraged to do so by 
Ruben Acosta, now president of the International Volleyball Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during the 1970s and early 1980s that Lu earned his reputation as one 
of the world's top technical coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Arie Selinger, the U.S. women's coach in the 1984 Olympic Games, Doug Beal, 
the U.S. men's coach in '84, and Marv Dunphy, the U.S. men's coach in '88, are 
among the people who consider Lu a volleyball guru. 
</P>
<P>
 Selinger helped Lu land the assistant coaching position at UC Santa Barbara, 
where he helped Kathy Gregory guide the Gauchos to a 231-121 record in 10 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara qualified for the NCAA Division I playoffs during each of those 
years and was annually regarded as one of the top defensive teams in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lu does not foresee instant success at Northridge, however. 
</P>
<P>
 He inherits a program that is expected to have five senior starters next 
season, but Lu figures it will take two or three years before the Matadors -- 
with a roster comprising players he recruited -- completely reflect his 
coaching philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, it might be another year or two before Northridge can rid itself of 
the stigma surrounding the program and the resultant recruiting disadvantage in 
the wake of Ker's sudden resignation in January of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Ker, who guided the Matadors to a 401-144 record over 14 seasons, cited 
"family considerations" for his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Later it was learned that Ker's resignation came after two Northridge players 
filed a written complaint accusing him of sexual harassment. Other former 
players also alleged that in the early 1980s, Ker had consensual sexual 
relations with team members. 
</P>
<P>
 Price, who guided Northridge to a runner-up finish in the NCAA men's 
championships last year, replaced Ker on a one-year interim basis after the 
four finalists for the job declined the position. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Northridge won three NCAA Division II titles during the 1980s, the 
Matadors have qualified for the playoffs only once since moving to the Division 
I level in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is impossible in one year to be successful," Lu said. "You must be 
prepared to fail because your most-successful experiences are when you fail, 
not when you succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 Lu is painfully aware of the difference in the way the Matador men's and 
women's teams are perceived. 
</P>
<P>
 "(John Price) can go to recruits and say, 'We finished second in the nation,' 
" Lu said. "Because of the program's success, his voice will be very loud and 
very strong. But it is different with the women's team. . . . Some people still 
don't know that Northridge is a Division I program." 
</P>
<P>
 So why did Lu come to Northridge, where he will have to battle traditional 
powers Cal State Long Beach, UCLA, USC and UC Santa Barbara for recruits? 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything, he wanted a collegiate program to call his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is grateful for the opportunity at UCSB, it was Kathy Gregory who 
got the credit. She was Northwest Region coach of the year in 1986, '90 and 
'93, the Big West coach of the year in 1990 and '93, and the Division I coach 
of the year last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "At UCSB, the head coach recruited and handled other matters," Lu said 
matter-of-factly. "I handled everyday training and year-round training. But at 
the end of the season, she was the one who got this award or that award." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the esteem he holds in the volleyball community, it seems that "The 
Professor" would like to win a few awards of his own at Northridge.

EVERETT HITS PASSING SHOT AT ESPN2'S ROME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY and T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Ram quarterback Jim Everett, upset by comments made by ESPN2 talk show 
host Jim Rome during a live interview Wednesday night, attacked Rome in the 
network's Hollywood studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett became upset when Rome repeatedly called him "Chris Evert," a 
reference to the female tennis star and Everett's questionable courage to take 
a hit, during an interview on "Talk 2." Everett shoved a table between them 
away and knocked Rome backward off his chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett then jumped on Rome. No punches appeared to be thrown, and they were 
separated by studio workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rome said he was not injured in the incident and that Everett did not 
apologize afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't directly apologize to me, but he seemed remorseful," Rome said. "He 
said as he left, 'I've had to put up with this stuff for three years in L.A., 
and I just snapped.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Everett, traded by the Rams to the New Orleans Saints on March 18 for a 
seventh-round draft pick in 1995, was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports from New York last fall quoted some of Everett's Ram teammates 
referring to the quarterback as "Chris Evert," for his lack of willingness to 
take a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, we felt very unfortunate (about the incident)," Rome said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our producer had called Jim in Las Vegas and asked him if he had any problems 
being called Chris Evert. The producer said we wanted him to be comfortable. If 
he didn't feel comfortable, then he shouldn't come." 
</P>
<P>
 But Everett became upset with the reference after Rome questioned him about 
the quarterback's "phantom sack" in the Rams' 31-3 loss to the San Francisco 
49ers in the 1990 NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett: "You better take a station break. You have been talking behind my 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Rome: "Well, now I'm saying it to your face." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett: "I bet you won't say it again." 
</P>
<P>
 Rome did. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett then went after Rome. The network cut away, but returned later to 
Rome, who said: "Hated for something like that to happen. But that's that."

MASTERS BECOMES MORE PRIVATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHERWA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the toughest tickets in sports just got a little tougher. The Masters, 
which has allowed public sale of tickets for the practice rounds, will 
discontinue that policy next year.Instead, only those who have previously 
attended a practice round will be eligible to buy a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 It was estimated that upward of 50,000 were on the course Tuesday. Public sale 
of tickets for the tournament rounds was discontinued in 1967. It's estimated 
that Augusta National limits those sales to about 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Tournament officials have always refused to disclose the number of tickets 
sold. When asked why, Jack Stephens, tournament chairman, said: "Cliff Roberts, 
one of our co-founders, thought that was a good idea, and I'm too scared to 
change it." JOHN CHERWA

THEATER REVIEW; A COUPLE OF 'JERRY'S GIRLS' STAND OUT FROM THE CROWD; BALLADEER 
LISA RICHARD AND COMIC SINGER PAT BOLDT DO THEIR BEST TO REDEEM THE TIRED 
MUSICAL DIRECTION AND STAGING.

 A critic once said that Jerry Herman didn't write songs, he wrote anthems. 
It's a very good way of explaining the sense of energy in Herman's writing and 
its insistence on being entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the production of "Jerry's Girls" at the Cabrillo Playhouse is often 
entertaining, the lack of energy in Dan Blackley's direction, and more 
especially in the plonky musical direction and accompaniment by Diane King 
Vann, takes a lot of sparkle out of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 What works splendidly is the performance by Lisa Richard. She wisely has been 
given most of the ballads, from "It Only Takes a Moment" to "I Am What I Am," 
and her inner fire and flawless vocal technique are exceptional, along with her 
fine understanding of how to make a ballad into a piece of acting. She knows 
how to slide off a plaintive note with subdued passion and just the right 
moments to open up and wail. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Boldt has some highlights in her solos, too. A good brassy musical comedy 
delivery puts over such Herman standards as "Just Leave Everything to Me" 
(though sending Boldt into the audience during the song was a dumb move), the 
comic razzmatazz of "Look What Happened to Mabel," and the lingering, haunting 
"Song of the Sand." Most of the comedy in the show, the comedy songs included, 
come very close to hitting the nail on the head in the hands of April Morgan, 
who is often funny, even when she's tailgating a vocal pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 The three backup singers/dancers, Nanci Fast, Danette Haddad and Jacqueline 
Prince, aren't as accomplished, and musical director Vann compounds her 
turgidity by not altering the trio's numbers so that their upper registers fade 
out to nothingness. When the key is low enough, they do well enough. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Perry B. Ash's costumes sparkle literally and figuratively, but there's a 
decided lack of sparkle in Bob Murphy's choreography, which might look a bit 
better, especially during the humorous sections, with more accomplished 
dancers. Ed Howie's lighting design is an on-and-off affair, usually pretty 
bright, but at some inopportune moments completely off, and Paul Vogler's 
setting, which purports to have something to do with Manhattan, is sketchy and 
looks as though it was done in about an hour.

COMEDY REVIEW; BOBBY SLAYTON AND THE JOY OF VEX; AT THE IRVINE IMPROV, HE'S 
INDISCRIMINATELY INSENSITIVE -- AND FUNNY. HE SAYS HE JUST WANTS US TO THINK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The chances of Bobby Slayton ever being keynote speaker for the NAACP are 
about the same as his addressing a NOW convention. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It just isn't going to happen, unless the audience is given free guns and 
unlimited ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night at the Irvine Improv, the acerbic comedian again underscored his 
basic right to insult and demean all creeds and colors.  
</P>
<P>
 That's fine. As long as he isn't playing favorites, we can forgive him his 
sins. But Slayton's act raises an interesting and difficult question: If he is 
criticized as being racist, sexist, politically incorrect, lacking in 
sensitivity training and hostile to the crowd, how come he's been at this 16 
years now? And doing quite well? 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody must like this shock treatment. Somebody must approve of him. The 
crowds keep coming back to hear the raspy-voiced entertainer, who played to a 
nearly full house Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But before Slayton comes off sounding like a social ulcer, it must be 
mentioned that his material is funny and his observations strike a nerve. 
Consider his disdain for the Statue of Liberty's beckoning the poor, huddled 
masses: 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not send us the ones who stand erect and have a written language?" he 
wondered. 
</P>
<P>
 So who came first? Slayton or the audience? Are his fans merely victims of 
Slayton's salacious diatribes? Or do they fan his demons, driving him to new 
depths? Does he plumb stereotypes for cheap laughs, or is he trying to jar his 
fans into thinking? 
</P>
<P>
 Indications are such: Later in the show, he said: "OK. Let's review everything 
we've learned tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Slayton is among the busiest comics around. He's booked solid through 1994, 
spending 40 to 45 weeks on the road. Not surprisingly, the Los Angeles resident 
is eager for a TV deal and more time at home, and it bugs him immensely that 
Jeffrey Dahmer could get an hour on prime-time but he can't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who do I have to eat to get on TV?" he asked, not necessarily kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 Slayton started the show slamming Mexicans, moved on to blacks, made a stop in 
Asia and then segued into blondes before adding that Jewish women are the major 
cause of homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent the rest of the night leapfrogging around, with much of the material 
revolving around sex and sex acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Slayton, with his machine-gun delivery, hasn't always been this way. As a 
22-year-old rookie, he was doing basic observational material. A fast-food joke 
here, an airline joke there. Over time, however, his act evolved. Like the 
earliest life forms sprouting legs when they left the water, Slayton realized 
he needed legs for his routine. When something worked, he kept it. What seems 
to have worked for him is the racist, sexist stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 But to brand Slayton racist and sexist is a red herring. Slayton insists it's 
all in fun and he's just doing his job. He comes to a club, gets money, makes 
people laugh. It's all part of the deal. And if he makes someone think, all the 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 He's just giving the customers what they're paying for. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point Tuesday, he admitted as much. 
</P>
<P>
 "By laughing at this kind of crap, you're only encouraging me," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 But under it all, maybe he's the voice of anger and frustration bursting out 
against waiters who don't understand English, sexist males, whining women. He 
forces issues to the surface. He's rough, basic and acerbic, but he does have 
an agenda. By confronting issues, we have to deal with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Slayton rejects comparison to Andrew Dice Clay and the late Sam Kinison, 
insisting he's not in that category of ranting and raving. The married father 
of a 5-year-old daughter says they're much more vicious while his material is 
simply funny. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no denying, however, that Slayton's act has an edge. The audience can 
almost feel the tension in the room. When is someone going to snap and level 
this little funny man with the new-grown goatee? But Slayton is confident. He 
keeps the pace up. He doesn't slow down. 
</P>
<P>
 Does he pander to an audience? Or is he really a sexist pig? Who knows. The 
mystery sells the message. Who'd go see him if underneath it all he were just a 
boy from Mr. Rogers' 'Hood with a fake edge? 
</P>
<P>
 * Bobby Slayton appears through April 17, except Monday, at the Irvine Improv, 
4255 Campus Drive, Irvine. $8 to $12. Call (714) 854-5455.

CITY HALL NEWS; AZUSA; CANDIDATES AGREE THAT THE CITY NEEDS TO REPAIR ITS IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayoral and council candidates agree that the City Council must present a 
united front to improve Azusa's declining image and attract new business. But 
when it comes to how to achieve that, they are worlds apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen John Dangleis, Anthony Naranjo and Stephen J. Alexander are running 
for mayor now that Eugene F. Moses has stepped down after 10 years to run for 
state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten others, including two former councilmen, are battling for the council 
seats vacated by two of the mayoral contenders in Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to change the city's image and be more receptive to investors. . . 
. The council has to stop looking like a bunch of bitching kids," said 
Dangleis, 62, who spent 14 years as a city administrator, first in Azusa and 
then in Carson, before becoming a councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's image problem stems in part from such matters as poor air quality 
and old-fashioned architecture. It has been compounded by nearly a decade of 
political infighting among council members and a City Hall with a reputation 
for being less-than-receptive to business concerns. Together, these factors 
have deterred many businesses from locating in Azusa, a community of 41,000 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangleis, a one-term councilman, said he would promote the city to investors 
through a public relations push and a more business-friendly City Hall. He said 
he would maintain control of the volatile council meetings, which he said have 
worsened the city's image, as have the council's attempts to close the Azusa 
Rock quarry. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarry has concerned environmentalists, who fear its operation may be 
damaging the mountainside where it is located. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander sees the quarry at Fish Canyon as part of Azusa's poor image and 
would like to restrict its operation because of the dust it releases. 
</P>
<P>
 A 38-year-old attorney, Alexander said taxes and what he terms "redevelopment 
giveaways" are hurting the city. He opposes an assessment that was added to 
electric bills to pay for fire service. 
</P>
<P>
 The third mayoral candidate, Naranjo, 38, a two-term councilman who has 
attended council meetings since childhood, said he would encourage investment 
in the community through promoting youth and senior citizens' programs, 
adequately staffing the Police Department and making City Hall more fiscally 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Naranjo has been the subject of two failed recalls because of his support of 
the Azusa Rock quarry and in this election is the only mayoral candidate to 
have received campaign contributions from its owners. The amount contributed by 
quarry owners is not known because Naranjo has not filed his final campaign 
contribution statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangleis, too, is haunted by his past. In 1987 he left the Carson 
administrator's post while under investigation by the district attorney's 
office for his role in awarding a $300,000-a-year insurance contract to an 
agency owned by a friend and business associate. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his contract expired, the council learned Dangleis had apparently not 
disclosed $1,200 in income from work he had done for the insurance company that 
got the city business. Dangleis denied any wrongdoing. The city put him on paid 
leave until his contract expired; the probe also was dropped at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 The council candidates are: 
</P>
<P>
 Don Flowers, 51, Planning Commission chairman and building contractor, who 
wants to attract new businesses and retain existing ones. He likes the idea of 
hiring a public relations firm to promote the city. He favors the quarry's 
continued operation and has accepted $510 in campaign contributions from its 
owners. No other council candidates have received money from the quarry. 
</P>
<P>
 Claro Perez, 46, who owns a cash register business, is campaigning for 
recreational programs for youth, health programs for seniors and job training 
to reduce unemployment. He said more after-school programs are needed to keep 
youth away from crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Romy Torres Pangilinan, did not return calls or provide a campaign statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry L. Stemrich, 62, a former councilman and retired businessman, said he 
would increase police presence on the streets by placing paid volunteers in 
police squad cars. He survived two recalls while in office for his support of 
the quarry and was a leader in the fight against malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando L. Camarena, 47, a former councilman and a national auction group 
executive, is a fiscal conservative who said he would use his negotiation 
experience to aid redevelopment deals. Camarena favors tighter regulation of 
the quarry and wants to see more Americans of Mexican descent on the council, 
in a city where 53% of the population is Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Moritz-Beebe, 31, a real estate appraiser, said teamwork and 
communication at City Hall must be improved. She wants Azusa city staff to 
treat residents with a customer-service approach. She said little can be done 
about the quarry. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Morales, 62, a city historical commissioner, is the town's proud gadfly 
and a war veterans' leader. He opposes the assessment on electric bills, wants 
to protect mobile home residents from rent increases and favors stricter 
regulation of the quarry. 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Rubio Martinez, 48, a clerk at a home building supply store, is a 
community activist involved in many local service groups, from PTA to the 
police chief's committee on crime. She opposes the assessment fees and said new 
leadership is needed to redevelop the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Nine, 58, a real estate agent, favors a public relations drive to 
promote the city to outsiders and said his experience in real estate would be 
an asset. 
</P>
<P>
 David O. Hardison, 47, owner of a building materials business, advocates the 
construction of more single-family homes in the city on unused land. He said 
new residents would attract retailers. He wants to put an end to political 
infighting and calls the quarry a false issue because he believes the city does 
not have the legal authority to close it.

CITY HALL JOURNAL; BELL GARDENS; OFFICIAL GIVES UP HIS 'COLD' LICENSE PLATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The great plate debate has ended in Bell Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 It was common practice for Bell Gardens city managers to have their vehicles 
equipped with so-called "cold" license plates, which the California Vehicle 
Code says can be requested by a police chief or district attorney for city 
employees who are engaged in "investigating actual or suspected violations of 
the law."So Police Chief Andy Romero requested the plates for City Manager 
Charles Gomez's city vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 A political firestorm erupted. When the smoke cleared, Gomez gave up the 
special plates, saying that they were not worth the aggravation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cold" plates, which look like ordinary license plates, are coded to make it 
difficult to obtain information about the driver from the Department of Motor 
Vehicles, said DMV spokesman Bill Madison. They are issued primarily to police 
officers, judges and district attorneys, and are often requested by police 
agencies for use by undercover officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy started when residents received flyers in the mail charging 
that Gomez and Romero "allegedly participated in perjury of documents violating 
the California Vehicle Code." The origin of the newsletter was not included. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez said he filled out a DMV form requesting the plates after city staff 
members told him two former city managers had used them. Romero said he signed 
the DMV form authorizing Gomez to receive the plates because he also understood 
previous city managers had them. The plates were placed on Gomez's city vehicle 
in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez's use of the plates is not illegal, "but may be unethical," the DMV's 
Madison said. The department relies on police personnel and district attorneys 
who apply for "cold" plates to police themselves, he said. JENNIFER OLDHAM

POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: UNEASY SILENCE IN SMOKING WARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's quiet on the smoking front. Too quiet, Long Beach Councilman Evan 
Anderson Braude fears. 
</P>
<P>
 A tough new set of smoking restrictions for Long Beach will appear on 
Tuesday's ballot as Proposition K, but without the pitched battle residents 
have come to expect on smoking issues. No phone banks, no direct mail from 
groups supported by the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't mean that (mailings) won't come," said Braude, who introduced the 
no-smoking ordinance. "It could be that they're . . . holding back until right 
before the elections." 
</P>
<P>
 Braude's concern over possible opposition is based on a history of smoking 
wars in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The council backed down from a 1991 ordinance to ban smoking in restaurants 
after a petition drive financed by the tobacco industry collected enough 
signatures to put the issue on a citywide ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the council passed an ordinance to outlaw smoking in all businesses 
used by the public, except patio restaurants and bars, where up to a third of 
the seating could be set aside for smokers. But within 30 days, an organization 
calling itself the Long Beach Business & Convention Coalition spent about 
$65,000 on a petition drive to overturn the ordinance. The coalition received 
funding from R.J. Reynolds, Philip Morris and other tobacco interests, 
according to a campaign disclosure statement. So council members -- all 
nonsmokers -- decided to put the issue before voters Tuesday. Then, Braude 
said, they waited for a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tobacco-backed coalition that forced Proposition K onto the ballot 
dissolved their organization. Those opposing tough smoking bans appear to have 
taken their fight to the state level. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Carl Cowan, co-founder of Citizens for a Healthy Long Beach, said 
his organization will mail a "Yes on K" flyer to 11,000 households before 
Tuesday's polling. The group made two other mailings in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NO DEAL: One of the hottest questions thrown around Pico Rivera candidate 
forums is whether a casino proposal, narrowly defeated by voters last year, 
will reappear after Tuesday's City Council election. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of nine challengers competing for three City Council seats have 
emphasized that they oppose a card club. Incumbents John G. Chavez and Richard 
L. Mercado Sr. endorsed the casino proposal in June. Mayor Alberto Natividad, 
who also supported the card club, is not seeking reelection. The casino measure 
lost by 209 votes.  
</P>
<P>
 But casino promoter Claude L. Booker said he has no interest in reviving the 
plan to build a $35-million card club here. "It's a dead issue," said Booker, 
who has moved to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 LATE NIGHT: Six of the so-called "Long Beach 7" mayoral candidates were on 
cable TV this week, finally receiving the equal time they demanded after being 
excluded from an earlier televised forum. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem is that the forum featuring these lesser-funded candidates 
has been scheduled for some time slots that are meant for insomniacs, one 
candidate complained. 
</P>
<P>
 The first forum, sponsored by the Junior Chamber of Commerce, only included 
the six mayoral front-runners who have gathered the most campaign funds: Mayor 
Ernie Kell, Vice Mayor Jeffrey A. Kellogg, Councilman Ray Grabinski, Frank 
Colonna, Beverly O'Neill and Donald Westerland. A tape of their forum was 
replayed on the local cable channel 18 times -- all in the afternoon or prime 
time -- after airing Feb. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Excluded candidates, who dubbed themselves the Long Beach 7, finally had their 
forum taped Friday. But to give them the same number of time slots before 
Election Day, some repeats had to air about 1 a.m. "This still isn't fair," 
said mayoral candidate Dan Rosenberg, who appears on the second forum, along 
with challengers Ronnie Barnes, Lee Chauser, Thomas (Ski) Demski, Terry Stidom 
and El Nora Willingham. Candidate G. Juan Johnson refused to appear. He has 
sued the cable company, charging that he was denied equal access. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 PAY-BACK: Four years ago, Santa Fe Springs Councilmen Ronald S. Kernes and Al 
Fuentes won their seats easily. Now Kernes, a 16-year council veteran, and 
Fuentes, who is seeking a second term, are fighting city employees and 
firefighters to keep their council jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The political battle erupted, firefighters say, over an engine company. The 
council decided last year to eliminate one of the four fire engine companies. 
Firefighters say the move exposed the city to threats of runaway fires in oil 
and manufacturing plants. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Santa Fe Springs Firemen's Assn. and the City Employees Assn. decided 
to support challengers Hazel Fields and George Minnehan. The groups have given 
$3,370 each to Fields and Minnehan and volunteers have blanketed doorsteps with 
leaflets supporting the challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort has angered Kernes, who has said in public forums that firefighters 
and city employees targeted him because they went without a pay raise last 
year. "I guess it's pay-back time," Kernes said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 LIQUID ASSETS: A little-discussed measure on Tuesday's ballot in Long Beach 
would grant the city Water Department new powers to buy land, even if the 
property is not used for water and sewer operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition L was originally intended to allow the Water Department to move a 
city garden off its land and lease the site to a commercial grower, said Robert 
W. Cole, the department's general manager. The department's charter has to be 
changed to allow officials to spend money on the move, which was not strictly 
water-related. The changes, which require voters' approval, include new 
land-buying powers not requested by department officials, Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Donna Gwin), who helped prepare the charter amendment, said 
the new land-buying powers were included at the request of City Council members 
who believe the Water Department could assist the city in future land 
purchases.

CITY HALL NEWS; PASADENA; BIAS ALLEGATIONS BY WOMEN AIMED AT CITY ATTORNEY ARE 
INVESTIGATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An independent consultant is investigating allegations of discrimination 
against women who work in the Pasadena city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation into whether City Atty.Victor J. Kaleta discriminated 
against his female employees is to be completed in several weeks, said Ramon 
Curiel, director of affirmative action, who would not release details of the 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaleta could not be reached for comment. But a memo he issued to his staff 
said the investigation is focusing on allegations of "differential treatment as 
they relate to the (complainant) and other female professionals in the city 
attorney's office (and) . . . of preferential treatment toward male 
professionals . . . related to personnel actions." 
</P>
<P>
 The memo also indicated that the female staffer had complained before and that 
Kaleta called for the investigation to clear the air.

CITY HALL NEWS; ARCADIA; OFFICIAL'S CARWASH CLEANS CITY'S FLEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A carwash business owned by an Arcadia councilman seeking reelection Tuesday 
has received more than $40,000 from the city in his last four years of office 
for cleaning the city's fleet of cars, city records show. Fasching's Car Wash, 
owned by George Fasching, reportedly netted $41,743 while he was on the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman voted four times to approve a vehicle maintenance budget that 
included cleaning of city cars and vans at his own facility. The city attorney 
said although conflict of interest is not a crime, he will advise that if 
Fasching is reelected, the councilman should abstain from voting on the issue 
in the city budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Fasching's defenders said that his carwash is the only one in town and that 
the business cleaned the city's cars for several years before Fasching was 
elected. But the councilman's critics pointed to a new carwash on the 
Arcadia/Temple City border, which is not getting the city's business. 
</P>
<P>
 Fasching said his carwash has cleaned the city's cars for 12 to 14 years and 
that he gives the city a discount of $2.25 per vehicle because it buys blocks 
of tickets. "I do a favor for the city," he said.

CITY HALL NEWS; SOUTH PASADENA; COUNCIL ACCUSED OF VIOLATING MEETING LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A local political watchdog group has filed a complaint with the district 
attorney's office, claiming the City Council knowingly violated the state's 
open meeting law. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Pasadena Taxpayers Assn. is seeking an investigation into a closed 
council session that allegedly violated the Brown Act.At the session, the 
council allegedly hired the law firm Franscell, Strickland, Roberts & Lawrence 
to defend the city against a civil rights suit filed by former Mayor Lee D. 
Prentiss. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint says the council retained the firm to replace the city attorney 
in late 1993. It publicly approved the hiring March 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "This cover-up occurred because the council was embarrassed by the lawsuit and 
the fact it has already spent $250,000 on attorneys fighting Prentiss," said 
association spokesman Thomas Biesek. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Edward Lee said the council did not violate the law because the 
closed-session discussion concerned litigation, an exception to the law.

 The City Council has approved a $23-million retail and entertainment complex 
that will include 24 movie theaters, five restaurants and 10,000 square feet of 
retail space on a 10-acre site at Norwalk Boulevard and the Santa Ana (5) 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Judith Brennan, Robert J. Arthur and Michael Mendez voted for 
the development.Mayor Luigi A. Vernola and Councilman Gordon Stefenhagen 
abstained. Both own land near the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Developer Rex Swanson said the development should attract 1.6 million to 2 
million people per year and will bolster the city's dwindling retail sales tax 
base. The city has agreed to a 99-year lease with Swanson's El Segundo-based 
Metropolitan Development Associates, which guarantees the city $450,000 a year, 
the developer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Swanson said the complex will be finished in three to four years. JILL

NEW SHELTER, NEW CHANCE FOR PASADENA PARK RESIDENTS; HOMELESS: CITY OFFICIALS, 
CHURCHES AND PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN LIVING IN BAND SHELL REACH DEAL ON TEMPORARY 
HOUSING AND REHABILITATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For more than a year, Leroy Dowden and 10 other homeless people made 
Pasadena's Memorial Park their home. 
</P>
<P>
 In the park's Art Deco band shell, they set up a tent-like encampment with 
overturned shopping carts, rope and canvas. They posted pictures of their 
grandchildren and Martin Luther King Jr. They watched TV together on a small 
portable plugged into a band shell outlet. On good days, they pooled their 
money from collecting cans and bottles to pay for dinner -- chicken in the 
toaster oven, instant mashed potatoes and a couple of cans of green beans. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, though, they collected their belongings in plastic sacks, swept up 
the band shell and left the park for good. In a unique agreement, Pasadena city 
officials and social services providers reached a deal with regulars in the 
park's homeless encampment, asking them to leave in exchange for a program 
designed to help them find a new life elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Dowden, 60, was so excited by the prospect that he couldn't sleep during his 
last night in the park, tossing and turning and then waking at dawn, like a 
little boy on Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the encampment was like family; sure, he called the place home. But he 
chuckled at the thought that he would want to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mind leaving here?" he said with good-natured sarcasm. "Mind going on to 
something better? I look at it like this: The beginning is now to start anew, 
rebuild ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Memorial Park has been a popular homeless encampment, with its 
broad expanses and charming band shell. Church volunteers regularly dropped off 
food and clothing. Park officials left the bathrooms unlocked at night. Police 
officers didn't enforce the park's 10 p.m. curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 But last year, during the Altadena wildfire, the homeless encampment drew 
attention because its inhabitants lit fires at night for warmth. Then the 
Pasadena Senior Center, next door to the park, announced expansion plans. And 
then a local theater group, Theater Quest, announced plans to use the band 
shell for classical theater productions for high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 So the deal was put together, with suggestions from the park's regulars, by 
city officials and Joe Colletti, director of Lutheran Social Services in 
Pasadena. The city agreed to contribute $15,000 for the interim shelter and 
case management program. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the arrangement, the nine homeless men and two homeless women get 45 
days of interim shelter at New Revelation Baptist Church in Pasadena. During 
that period, Lutheran Social Services case managers will work with each person, 
helping with everything from job interviews, transportation, legal papers, 
credit advice and welfare benefits. The goal is to get each person into a 
rehabilitation program, shelter or housing within 45 days, Colletti said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11 homeless people have agreed to never sleep in Memorial Park again, and 
police will start enforcing the park's curfew and no-camping ordinance, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Rick Cole said the city is "intolerant of homelessness (but) 
compassionate of the homeless." The city does not want to make a homeless sweep 
or ride roughshod over anyone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trouble is, if you just push them out, they'll go somewhere else," he 
said. "Our goal in Pasadena is to not keep people homeless but for people to 
get out of being homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday afternoon, Leroy Thomas bundled up his clothes and sleeping bags 
into a shopping cart, waiting for a van to take him to the interim shelter. 
Thomas, 38, used to be a machinist and carpenter, but he got caught up in a 
drug problem. Now he dreams of getting into a drug rehabilitation program, 
finding a job and renting an apartment. Still, he leaves the park with some 
sadness. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a 50-50 feeling," said Thomas, who wore a Super Bowl XXVII cap and 
UCLA sweat shirt with the hood pulled tightly over his head. "You kind of feel 
like you're leaving your home . . . and partly like someone is helping us. I'm 
just going for it. It's good to try something new. Maybe this'll put me on the 
right track."

'DEMOLITION BY NEGLECT'; LONG BEACH MAY USE LESSON OF BUFFUM HOUSE TO SAVE 
OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The custom stained-glass windows have long been shattered at the Tudor-style 
mansion commonly called the Buffum house. The ornate, hand-carved mahogany 
hearth and some artwork were rescued by preservationists, but the copper 
ornamental siding panels that covered the outside walls were pilfered by 
vandals years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Empty beer bottles, trash and other debris are strewn about the floor in this 
once-majestic 1920s mansion, which will soon disappear from a bluff overlooking 
the ocean at 10th Place in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The dilapidated 28-room mansion, which has been vacant for five years, is 
scheduled to be torn down this week. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Buffum house legacy may survive the wrecking ball. City officials now 
are working on policies to deal with historic and vacant structures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is essential that we learn from this sorry situation and take steps to 
ensure that we do not continue to see our city's historic heritage erode away 
through neglect and abandonment," Councilman Alan S. Lowenthal wrote in a memo 
to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, at Lowenthal's urging, the council imposed a 90-day moratorium on 
demolition of all historic buildings while its housing committee explores 
possible laws to save landmark buildings and policies for dealing with vacant 
structures. There are an estimated 2,500 to 3,000 vacant buildings in Long 
Beach, Lowenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Preservationists say they are particularly concerned about a practice they 
call "demolition by neglect," when developers allow a vacant historic structure 
to deteriorate. Long Beach does not have ordinances to protect vacant 
buildings, even if they may have historic value. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffum mansion, at 25 10th Place, has been vacant since it was purchased 
in 1988 by a New York-based investment company, which planned to build a 
15-story condominium on the square block between 9th and 10th places. Long 
Beach officials quickly approved the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cultural Heritage Commission wanted to protect the mansion, but found 
itself without any tools to do so, said Ruthann Lehrer, the city's historic 
preservation officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The real-estate market slumped, and the property changed hands several times. 
When the current owners bought the property in 1992, the crumbling mansion was 
being criticized by neighbors as an eyesore. Last fall, the city's Planning 
Department ordered the building to be fixed or torn down. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cultural Heritage Commission, realizing the house was in imminent danger, 
mounted a last-ditch effort to have it designated a historic site, Lehrer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission pointed out that the mansion had been built by C.T. McGrew, one 
of the city's most renowned early builders. He built the Mercantile Building, 
on 1st Street and Pine Avenue, and many apartments and homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The home's first owner was Carlyle Nibley, president of the local Packard 
Motor Cars dealership. The house got its name from Robert Buffum, a doctor who 
may have been related to the department-store family, according to historians. 
He lived there from 1959 to 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, however, the City Council rejected the heritage commission's 
proposal, in part because the structure had deteriorated so much. Officials say 
it would need about $900,000 worth of repairs to meet city codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Bullard, who represents the investment group that bought the property 
in 1992, said three potential developers pulled out of the condominium project 
because of delays, but he is negotiating with another builder. "I went in to 
clean up a mess, and all it's been is a headache," he said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Several historic Long Beach buildings have been allowed to deteriorate to the 
point of becoming public nuisances, Lowenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's housing committee is exploring the policies of cities such as 
Pasadena and Claremont, which allow demolition only if, after rigorous 
examination, no alternatives can be found. The committee also is considering an 
ordinance that would require owners to pay for a city inspection of the 
buildings on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Buffum house situation was a disaster," Lowenthal said. "We have to be 
more proactive."

CITY'S OFFER MAY SMOKE OUT FIREARMS; WEAPONS: MERCHANTS WILL GIVE A $100 
GROCERY CERTIFICATE FOR EACH GUN TURNED IN. NO QUESTIONS WILL BE ASKED.

<P>
 Maybe it's a dusty old .22-caliber rifle, sitting in a back closet. Or a .357 
magnum, hidden from curious children. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever type of gun it is, it can be traded for groceries next month in Long 
Beach when the city, following the lead of other urban centers, offers a 
goods-for-guns exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone turning in a gun to a designated church during four weekends in May 
will receive a $100 grocery certificate from local markets. Sponsors said they 
hope to remove more than 400 guns from city homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope the message will touch the hearts of younger people," said Marie 
Treadwell, president of Long Beach's branch of the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People. "Those who are in gangs and have a gun . . . we 
hope they will turn that gun in." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council agreed to co-sponsor the effort Tuesday with the NAACP, 
community groups and a coalition of churches. The plan was introduced by Mayor 
Ernie Kell, who said he expects most major supermarkets in the city will donate 
certificates. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar exchanges have become popular throughout the country in recent months, 
with guns being exchanged for concert tickets in Los Angeles, toys in New York 
and car washes and Mighty Ducks hockey tickets in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 As with other exchanges, the Long Beach program will offer amnesty for gun 
holders, Kell said, and nobody will be asked where a gun came from. 
</P>
<P>
 Firearms will be collected by uniformed police officers and inspected. If a 
weapon was used in crime, it will be kept as evidence. All others will be 
destroyed, Kell said. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 412 rifles and handguns were collected in a five-day period in Los 
Angeles in December, and Long Beach community leaders said they hope to match 
that number. 
</P>
<P>
 The city hopes to have $40,000 in grocery certificates to exchange for guns. 
The mayor's office has contacted several supermarket chains but has not 
received firm commitments, said Tom Poe, Kell's chief deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun collection effort in Long Beach brings together several diverse 
groups, including the League of United Latin American Citizens, Federation of 
Filipino Americans, United Cambodian Community and the United Samoan Community, 
along with the NAACP.

POSTAL WORKERS STAGE PROTEST OVER LABOR CONDITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Disgruntled employees rallied outside the Glendora post office last week, 
protesting what they said are overly strict working conditions and a waste of 
taxpayer money. 
</P>
<P>
 As the evening rush-hour traffic sped along Glendora Avenue on March 30, a 
dozen employees, accompanied by a few spouses and their children, handed out 
pamphlets detailing their complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers complain that post office managers routinely discipline letter 
carriers for leaving their routes without permission -- even to use the 
bathroom -- and cite them for failing to turn the wheels of postal vehicles 
when parking downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 Since January, 51 in-house job grievances have been filed at the 113-person 
office and seven complaints lodged with the federal Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission. Postal officials said two-thirds of the 51 grievances 
have been resolved to the satisfaction of both parties; the other third are 
pending, as are the seven EEOC complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen similar EEOC complaints last year cost taxpayers at least $65,000 in 
hearings, investigations and employee time off, said postal workers. Postal 
officials disputed the $65,000 figure, but gave no corresponding dollar amount. 
</P>
<P>
 According to EEOC documents, three of the claims were resolved in favor of 
employees. In May, Glendora postal officials dropped 15 complaints filed mainly 
by employees disciplined for absences or tardiness. Glendora management decided 
not to pursue the disciplinary cases through EEOC hearings in an effort to 
improve working conditions, said Terri Bouffiou, a postal service spokeswoman. 
The local resolution saved money that would have been spent on arbitrators, 
hearings and studies, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Postal workers said Glendora's strict work conditions were lifted for a time 
last year after a fired Dana Point postal employee stabbed his mother to death, 
shot and killed a former postal co-worker and wounded three others, including 
another co-worker. But the conditions have resurfaced in Glendora, workers 
said, with supervisors monitoring employee trips to the bathroom and counting 
sips of water at the drinking fountain. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the kind of stuff that causes people to go off," said a Glendora post 
office employee who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Postal officials counter that the Glendora office is no more troubled than any 
other. The letter carriers' union at the Glendora office chooses to resolve 
disputes through the grievance procedure rather than through informal talks, 
Bouffiou said  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the labor climate there is any worse or better than other 
offices," Bouffiou said. "That's a pretty average post office." 
</P>
<P>
 The scrutiny that has sparked employee complaints occurs only when workloads 
on mail routes are being analyzed, Bouffiou said. Supervisors at that time may 
take detailed notes, logging trips to the bathroom and sips of water in their 
notes, she said. Glendora added two routes earlier this year after determining 
some routes were overburdened.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; WORLD'S FIRST NUCLEAR CRUISER TO BE SCRAPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After three decades in which it downed enemy aircraft, intercepted 
drug-runners and policed troubled waters, the U.S. nuclear cruiser Long Beach, 
the world's first, is on its final voyage: to the scrapheap. 
</P>
<P>
 The cruiser is being called home after 33 years of active duty, part of the 
Navy's effort to reduce its fleet to 330 ships. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently patrolling in the Caribbean, the Long Beach will head to Norfolk, 
Va., for a formal decommissioning ceremony in July. After its nuclear reactors 
are shut down and dismantled, the cruiser will be towed to a scrap yard in 
Washington's Puget Sound. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was commissioned in September, 1961, the 721-foot ship was the world's 
first cruiser powered by nuclear reactors. It also was the first warship with a 
guided-missile battery, and the first naval cruiser designed for the United 
States after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, the Long Beach made the first successful launch of a Tomahawk cruise 
missile. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Persian Gulf War in 1991, the Long Beach served as the U.S. 
flagship.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SIGNAL HILL; 3 EXECUTIVES PLEAD INNOCENT TO POLLUTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three executives of a crude-oil cleaning and storage facility have pleaded 
innocent to charges that they dumped toxic rainwater onto city streets in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing was scheduled for April 25 in Long Beach Municipal Court for the 
Petroleum Recycling Corp. officials -- Richard Davis McAuley, president; Ronald 
R. Daerr, compliance officer; and Mark James Vigeant, plant manager. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the district attorney's office filed a 38-count felony and 
misdemeanor complaint against the company and its three executives for 
allegedly dumping 200,000 gallons of tainted rainwater into a drain near the 
company's East 29th Street facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Police investigators said the water flowed onto a city street, into a storm 
drain and eventually into Marine Stadium waterway and Alamitos Bay. Police said 
the water contained benzene and dichloromethane, which have been identified as 
carcinogens.

 The executives contend they tested the water, found it to be clean, and 
received the proper permits for storm water discharge. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Fred E. Macksoud said the charges carry a maximum penalty 
of three years in prison for each of the officers and fines to the company of 
$100,000 for each of the nearly seven days in January, 1993, that the alleged 
violations took place.

COMMUNITY NEWS: NORWALK-LA MIRADA; SCHOOLS MULL PLAN FOR VIDEO CAMERAS ON BUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to install video cameras to curb horseplay on buses in the 
Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District will be considered by the school 
board on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 District staff proposes spending $12,000 to purchase four to six cameras in 
the district's 46-bus fleet to discourage students from distracting the driver 
by hitting each other, moving around or yelling, officials said.Metal boxes for 
the cameras would be installed in about 30 buses, and the cameras would be 
moved periodically from bus to bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Other districts, including ABC Unified, have cut down on misbehavior on buses 
by installing cameras, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students would know there's a box in front that (potentially) contains a 
camera," said Ginger Shattuck, deputy superintendent for educational services 
at Norwalk-La Mirada. "They don't want to be caught misbehaving by the camera. 
It really calms the buses down."

COMMUNITY NEWS: WHITTIER; BURGLAR SENTENCED TO LIFE FOR KILLING WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man has been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole 
for stabbing a Whittier woman to death in front of her 5-year-old 
granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 David Anthony Martinez, 25, of Whittier had pleaded not guilty by reason of 
insanity.But jurors found that he was sane when he broke into the house of 
52-year-old Romelia Salas on Comstock Avenue and stabbed her more than 20 times 
Oct. 26, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 After a one-week trial in Norwalk Superior Court, the jury found Martinez 
guilty of first-degree murder and burglary. Superior Court Judge Philip H. 
Hickok sentenced Martinez last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The child witnessed the attack, then locked herself in a bedroom as Martinez 
remained in the house through the night, according to a statement from the 
district attorney's office. The child ran to tell neighbors in the morning.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LA MIRADA; CITY URGED TO PAY FOR EXTRA LIBRARY HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Library supporters are petitioning the city to help pay for additional hours 
at the local county library branch, which dropped three days of service after 
budget cuts in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of the La Mirada Library, a community group headed by library 
volunteers, collected 2,000 signatures on petitions last month, said Loretta 
Abel Amley, chairwoman of the organization's Committee to Save the Library. "We 
would like to finance at least one more day of library service," Amley said. 
"It's for the benefit of La Mirada citizens."

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; CATALINA FIGHTS PLAN FOR SCHOOL DRESS CODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents on Catalina Island are fighting a Long Beach Unified School District 
policy that will require elementary and middle school students to wear uniforms 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 On the mainland, administrators hope the policy will help curb gang problems 
by limiting gang attire.But the 610-student Avalon schools, isolated from the 
rest of the district, do not have the same difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a lot of the problems that the mainland schools have," said 
travel agency owner Mike Lavelle, who has three children in school. He and 
other parents have launched a petition drive expressing dismay at the 
districtwide policy, which on Avalon will also include high school students 
because its campus is combined with other grades. 
</P>
<P>
 "I object to the dictatorial way in which Long Beach Unified decided to 
administer this thing," Lavelle said. Uniforms "are a decision that should be 
left to the parents." 
</P>
<P>
 School safety, however, is not the only intent of the policy, said Avalon 
Principal Mark Ur. With uniforms, students "are not teased or forced into 
competing, buying stylish brands," he said. "It gives students more 
self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 He said uniforms might instill more of a work ethic because "it gives 
(students) the feeling that they are putting on their work clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 A school committee will establish guidelines for the new uniforms, which might 
include an iron-on patch with the school's emblem, Ur said. 
</P>
<P>
 A town hall meeting is planned on April 19 to discuss the policy.

TOPICS / NEIGHBORHOODS; PARENTS PICKET MASSAGE SALON NEXT TO SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CARLSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A chain-link fence separates the windows of the Swedish Salon massage parlor 
on North Garey Avenue in Pomona from the curious eyes of children at Abraham 
Lincoln Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Two dozen parents and students from the newly expanded school stood on one 
side of the fence on a recent morning, holding picket signs and shouting, "Go 
away so we can play!" Cold eyes stared at the parlor and the talk was of 
pornographic magazines found crumpled in the schoolyard. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side sat the masseuses, who describe themselves as working 
mothers who are sick of being portrayed as prostitutes as they try to earn an 
honest living. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind closed doors, meanwhile, attorneys for both parties have spent most of 
the last two weeks arguing the legality of the parlor in a still-unfinished 
hearing that will determine if the city can deny the Swedish Salon an operating 
permit and shut down the business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedish Salon opened at 1293 N. Garey Ave. in 1969. The school, built in 
1937, was still on the other side of the block. But community objections grew 
over the years as the school added parking lots and playgrounds and moved 
closer and closer to the massage parlor, said Julian Villasenor, administrative 
director of elementary school services and programs for the Pomona Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the parlor applied to renew its business license in 1989, the city 
investigated, found several minor violations dealing with building codes and 
massage licenses and denied the request, said Roger Colvin, Pomona's deputy 
city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The parlor's owner, Herschel H. Jennings, fixed the problems, got his 
masseuses licensed by the city and appealed the denial to city officials. 
Scheduling conflicts have put the appeal in legal limbo for the past five years 
until the hearings began March 29, Colvin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings said that before 1989, the salon had operated for nearly 20 years 
with no violations. Police have never reported any illegal activity there.  
</P>
<P>
 But school officials and parents say they have collected pornographic 
magazines and packaged, unopened condoms that have been dropped over the fence. 
Parents complain that their children see the women who work at the salon 
wearing provocative clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some City Council members have made no bones about their desire to kick the 
parlor out of town. Mayor Eddie Cortez has gone on TV denouncing the salon, and 
Councilwoman Nell Soto, who has had five grandchildren attend Lincoln, has 
protested along with the parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council is determined to get rid of it one way or the other," Soto said. 
"We are determined to find some loophole . . . we want him to go away." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, Soto's desire to see the salon go was echoed by salon owner 
Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be more than happy to sell the property," said Jennings, noting that 
the city backed out of a deal to buy the land two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings wants the right to relocate to the site of his choice or get the 
right price for his land before he gives up his salon. "You can't take away 
someone's license just because you don't like them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But parent Cyndi Guerra sees it differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see these women coming to work in short skirts with plunging necklines . . 
. it's a bad influence on the children," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The women in question -- who were all modestly dressed the day of the protest 
-- are bewildered by the moral indignation of the parents. 
</P>
<P>
 One masseuse said: "Look, I have two kids in the district. (Another masseuse) 
volunteers at her school. And we're tired of our kids getting flak from the 
other kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The masseuse said she did not want to give her name "for obvious reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just normal working mothers here who happen to give massages," she 
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Ontario man who worked as a campus supervisor at a San Dimas center for 
abused children was arrested Tuesday on charges of misdemeanor possession of 
child pornography, including a large supply of magazines and videos, Ontario 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Edward Kochevar, 25, is being held at San Bernardino County's West 
Valley Detention Center on $100,000 bail.Ontario police originally arrested 
Kochevar March 21 after police searched his home and allegedly found the 
pornographic material.  
</P>
<P>
 Kochevar was released, then rearrested Tuesday after police finally sorted 
through and presented the mass of alleged evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Kochevar worked at the McKinley Home for Boys -- a residential treatment 
center for abused children -- for four months before his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive Director Jane Van Stedum said Kochevar has been suspended 
indefinitely. Van Stedum also said none of the children complained of problems 
with Kochevar during interviews the center conducted after his arrest. Kochevar 
is a trained child care worker who came to McKinley "with great references" and 
passed a standard background check for sex offenses, Van Stedum said. JOE

TOPICS / PUBLIC SAFETY; FIREFIGHTERS PRACTICING FLOOD-CHANNEL RESCUE TECHNIQUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Gabriel Fire Department is perfecting a rescue plan to save people who 
may fall into one of the dozen concrete-walled washes that snake across the San 
Gabriel Valley carrying rainwater from the foothills to the Rio Hondo and San 
Gabriel rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our flood-control channels are all vertical-wall channels," said Fire Chief 
Gene Murray, pointing out the difficulties of freeing someone caught in water 
rushing down the steep-walled washes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt it necessary to come up with a plan to make (rescues) safer for our 
people and give us the opportunity to help individuals who get caught in the 
washes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan centers around an eddy in the Rio Hondo wash, where rescuers can 
enter calmer water and try to grasp people floating by without a high risk of 
being swept away themselves, said fire engineer Gary Sauls, who designed the 
rescue plan. The rescue area is at the intersection of the Rio Hondo wash and 
Valley Boulevard, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cities with the drainage channels have established procedures for 
rescuing people caught in the washes, but Sauls and Murray hope their idea of 
setting up a safe site will become the model for such rescues across Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think a little bit of water won't wash you away . . . but 6 inches of 
water can knock you down and get you in trouble," Sauls said.

COVER STORY; A BATTERED BODY POLITIC; CONTROVERSY, INFIGHTING CHARACTERIZE 
ELECTIONS IN HUB CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Picture a red-white-and-blue sort of ribbon-cutting ceremony, the type held in 
towns everywhere. City council candidates nod approvingly during the dedication 
of a new sports program at the youth center. Parents and their children mill 
about, sharing hot dogs, sodas and the latest gossip. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, good manners dissolve and one candidate allegedly shoulder-slams 
another's 16-year-old cheerleader daughter. Assault charges are filed with the 
police department and the two candidates, former political allies, go to court. 
One candidate seeks a temporary restraining order. The other tells the judge 
the incident is imaginary. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to election season in Southeast Los Angeles County, where politics as 
usual is anything but. 
</P>
<P>
 From Vernon to South Gate, from Huntington Park to Bell Gardens, local 
politics in the area known as the Hub Cities is often a hubbub of conflict and 
scandal. Even to a jaded electorate that has come to expect political 
infighting and allegations, the consistent record of controversy in the densely 
populated 12-square-mile area stands out. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider recent history in Bell Gardens. In addition to the alleged assault on 
a candidate's daughter, there have been two recall campaigns launched in the 
past three years, closed session chair-throwing, allegations of voter fraud 
after the last two elections, and a council member fined $1,500 by the Fair 
Political Practices Commission for illegally casting a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, incumbent Josefina (Josie) Macias alleged that she received 
threatening letters and that her husband was run off the road by her opponents' 
supporters. Allegations of jobs and scholarships offered in return for votes 
and accusations of other political dirty tricks abound.  
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Andy Romero has told council members that he has turned so many 
city investigations over to the district attorney, the office is overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Things have gotten so bad that "people feel embarrassed" to admit they live in 
Bell Gardens, said Councilwoman Rosa Hernandez, who is seeking her second term. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people ask where they live, they say: 'A little place near Downey.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some say Bell Gardens politics is still recovering from the animosity created 
by the historic 1991 recall campaign that ousted four white council members and 
gave the city its first Latino council majority. But while the recall may have 
focused a media microscope on that city's political blemishes, it is not the 
only place in the area where politics is said to be, if not dirty, in need of a 
good dusting. 
</P>
<P>
 * In tiny Cudahy, where a half-dozen recall campaigns have been launched in as 
many years, one finally reached the ballot last year. Councilman John O. 
Robertson survived a recall effort organized by his four council colleagues 
only to become an issue in this year's election -- and he isn't even a 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson and two other men agreed to pay a $39,000 settlement in October 
after being named in a civil suit alleging that they misused funds from the Hub 
Cities Consortium, a regional job training program. But the defendants missed 
the December payment deadline and fees now amount to about $55,000. Robertson 
backs two council candidates who, some fear, if elected would vote to have the 
city pay his debt. Robertson asserts no fraud was found and it is the city's 
legal responsibility to support him. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Huntington Park, Councilman Luis M. Hernandez, running for his second 
term, still owes the Fair Political Practices Commission $10,000 from more than 
$20,000 in fines for violations he racked up during two other campaigns. The 
FPPC charged Hernandez with 11 violations of campaign disclosure practices in 
two campaigns, which it said "denied the public important information" before 
the two elections. The fines, Hernandez said, are "merely a smudge on my record 
rather than something that should take me out office. We feel we were fined 
substantially for first-time offenders." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Hernandez ally and political newcomer MariCarmen Medrano has asked 
the district attorney to investigate alleged fraudulent use of absentee ballots 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 * In South Gate, candidate Ted Moore, a vocal council critic who was summarily 
dismissed from the planning commission this year, temporarily vanished. Moore, 
who many depended on as council watchdog, filed candidate's papers and then 
disappeared without notifying the city. After some investigative work, 
officials determined that he had sold his house. Moore was missing for several 
weeks before he called City Clerk Nina Banuelos to inform her he was in Las 
Vegas and insisted he was still a candidate. He still has yet to surface in 
South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-city region that lies southeast of Downtown Los Angeles -- Bell, 
Bell Gardens, Cudahy, Commerce, Huntington Park, Maywood, South Gate and Vernon 
-- is a residential landscape characterized by single-family homes, card 
casinos and factories. Settled by Midwesterners and Dust Bowl refugees who 
sought a better life in California, the area was until the 1970s a middle-class 
white community where bustling industry backed up to thriving neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the past 20 years, the Southeast area has become a first stop for 
Latino immigrants and one of the poorer, more overcrowded regions in the state. 
Between 1980 and 1990, the population in Southeast cities grew by up to 33% and 
most of the newcomers were Latino. During the same period, heavy industry and 
some of the area's largest employers, such as General Motors, moved away, 
leaving toxic waste sites to clean up and thousands of people unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 If political instability and malfeasance in the area appear epidemic, the 
turbulence is no mystery, experts say. Local politics are a reflection of the 
demographic and economic upheaval in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a really tough time to be councilman in one of these Southeast cities," 
said political scientist Fernando J. Guerra, who heads the Chicano studies 
department at Loyola Marymount University. 
</P>
<P>
 "The demographic shift is understated and understudied in the Southeast," 
Guerra said. "The area has gone from 95% white to 80% and . . . up to 95% 
Hispanic. The area has deindustrialized and the tremendous transition that is 
occurring creates instability and political insecurity. . . . Until the late 
1980s, the councils weren't representative, but they were stable." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the overwhelmingly Latino population, five of the eight city councils 
still have white majorities. But whether political representation of Latinos 
has come with a jolt, as in Bell Gardens, or more gradually, as in Huntington 
Park, all the local city councils have begun to reflect their changed 
constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who assumed that Latino representation would mean harmony was sorely 
disappointed to see the Bell Gardens council break into bickering so fierce 
that two members now rarely speak. In Huntington Park, the Latino majority does 
not vote as a bloc. In fact, Councilman Hernandez's campaign rhetoric targets 
incumbent Raul Perez, also seeking his second term. 
</P>
<P>
 Such disagreements shouldn't surprise anyone because "Latinos cannot be 
identified as a political entity" any more than whites or African Americans, 
said David Hayes-Bautista, director of the Alta California Research Center, a 
Los Angeles think tank that studies Latino issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference, Hayes-Bautista said, is that in many cases the new crop of 
Latino council members has been ill-prepared to lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, California's Latino community has had few institutions to 
nurture leadership, Hayes-Bautista said. Unlike the African American community, 
where churches and black colleges and universities have provided stages to test 
aspiring leaders, few Latino leaders enter the political arena with experience; 
thus, they are making their mistakes in the harsh public limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic hard times have made the transition from white to Latino control even 
more difficult. Latinos elected to represent the concerns of working-class and 
poor constituents have had to impose utility taxes, assessments and budget cuts 
to steady sinking city budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have representation in those communities now, but (new Latino leaders) 
need to deal with very real problems there," said Larry Berg, director of the 
Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC. "They're at a distinct 
disadvantage because they don't have the resources to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates and incumbents acknowledge that council battles in the Southeast 
area have contributed to the region's turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park Councilman Raul R. Perez said city councils should use 
political appointments and other means to nurture potential leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a long time I criticized the council because they didn't prepare anyone 
to take over when they left," said Perez, who is seeking his second term. "I 
appointed a couple of people (to commissions) who are running against me now, 
but I can't criticize them because they have to cut their teeth somehow."  
</P>
<P>
 In Bell Gardens, council challenger Maria Victoria Martinez has included 
parenting, leadership and citizenship classes in her platform. Residents need 
to take responsibility for the community and help keep their leaders 
accountable, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "So many people here are new immigrants and they aren't used to speaking out 
and taking leadership roles," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voter apathy and a large non-citizen population play a role in lack of 
accountability in the area, observers said. About 40% to 50% of residents in 
the Southeast cities are not U.S. citizens, according to the 1990 Census. Of 
those registered to vote in the 1990 Bell election, 16% turned out. The 1992 
election was canceled because the incumbents drew no challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lack of media coverage is also a problem in the area, said Gregory Rodriguez, 
a researcher with the Alta California Research Center, who has studied the 
Southeast region. The South Gate Press and other local newspapers stopped 
publishing by 1992, creating a communication gap between city officials and 
residents.  
</P>
<P>
 "Politics becomes irrelevant because no one knows what's happening," Rodriguez 
said.

 City council candidates rallied some voters in 1992 by making race and 
representation into campaign issues. This year, 35 of 53 candidates are Latino, 
bread-and-butter issues such as accountability and crime are back in vogue, and 
some question whether having Latino leaders has made a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 In South Gate, where the council still has a white majority, "some people say 
it should be a Latino council because the majority of us are Latino," said 
Victorio Gutierrez, a South Gate High School teacher. "But it doesn't matter if 
you're white, pink or blue, you still need to be accountable. . . . It doesn't 
matter who gets in as long as they listen to the people." 
</P>
<P>
 In Bell Gardens, home of what some called a Latino revolution, voters "are 
ashamed" of their Latino leaders, said a longtime resident who would identify 
himself only as Ramon. "They say we have Latinos in there, but it was better 
the other way." 
</P>
<P>
 But even dogged Bell Gardens critics, such as former council candidate Victor 
Vaillette, said the leadership has matured and members have overcome initial 
gridlock to enact innovative policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent approval of a city-sponsored student loan program and support for a 
badly needed family health clinic demonstrate the council is capable of 
proactive policy that addresses some of the community's more pressing concerns, 
Vaillette said. 
</P>
<P>
 Having Latinos on the council has encouraged Huntington Park residents to 
participate in city meetings and programs, said Rudy Griego, a Huntington Park 
businessman and former Chamber of Commerce president. 
</P>
<P>
 "Latino leaders make (residents) want to vote and feel (the city) is theirs," 
said Rodriguez of the Alta California Research Center. "That will translate 
eventually into better government." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the Southeast cities worked together to bring a branch of East 
Los Angeles College to Huntington Park is also an example of Latino leaders 
having an impact in the region, said Assemblywoman Martha M. Escutia 
(D-Huntington Park).  
</P>
<P>
 "I frankly don't think that would have happened without Latino leaders on the 
councils," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Election officials in many cities said the campaigns this year have been 
relatively calm despite some requisite sign-stealing and name-calling. Still, 
fierce battles are being waged in Huntington Park and Bell Gardens, among other 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park Councilman Luis Hernandez and maverick MariCarmen Medrano have 
faced off against incumbent Raul Perez, former state legislative aide Rosario 
Marin and real estate agent Jessica Maes. There, camps are trading allegations 
of voter fraud and misinformation. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bell Gardens, opponents of challenger Maria Chacon allege that her camp is 
using bribery, intimidation and fraud to win the election, charges that Chacon 
vehemently denies. Chacon, a catalyst in the 1991 recall movement, has split 
with incumbent Josie Macias and teamed on the ticket with Planning Commissioner 
Ramiro Morales. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates in Maywood, Bell Gardens and Huntington Park are among those 
pushing residents to vote by absentee ballot and hoping to lock up their 
victories before Election Day. Maywood City Clerk Samuel A. Pena said he has 
had more than 800 requests for absentee ballots in a city where only about 
1,200 voted in the previous municipal election. Large numbers of candidates -- 
11 in South Gate and nine in Huntington Park -- also have complicated the races 
and are certain to make them closer, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the beleaguered councils stumble into maturity, real stability in the 
Southeast area could be a long time coming, Rodriguez said. In Bell Gardens, 
officials have estimated a 30% transience rate in the city and less than 25% of 
the 42,000 homes are owner-occupied, numbers that illustrate the instability of 
the population. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as the Southeast region remains an entry point for new immigrants -- a 
highly mobile population -- community leaders need to find ways to incorporate 
non-citizens into the political life of the city, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed to a Bell Gardens student loan program -- which requires parents to 
remain in the city while students are accepting city money and includes a 
community service component -- as an innovative example of programs that can 
encourage residents to stay put and become citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Southeast area) is at a nascent stage, but it will coalesce and get past 
the chair-throwing," Rodriguez said. "I don't think you can categorize these 
cities by allegation and indictments. This is only a snapshot in time and it 
will pass." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's election is not expected to be a major turning point for the 
Southeast area, but another small step in the area's maturation process. If the 
region can overcome its growing pains, Rodriguez said, it has the potential to 
become a regional political power to be reckoned with. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will bring pride back to the city of Bell Gardens," Councilwoman Hernandez 
stated at a recent council meeting. "We just need to survive this period."

SCHOOLS; STORYTELLER SPINS TALES OF CULTURAL TOLERANCE; TEACHING: IN SCHOOL 
PERFORMANCES, RAY DE LA PAZ IS PART FOLKLORIST, PART MORALIST AND PART STAND-UP 
COMIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The turban on Ray De La Paz's head elicits squeals of laughter from his 
audience of fifth- and sixth-graders at Barfield Elementary in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, is that a baby blanket on your head? I hope you remembered to take the 
baby out!" he teases himself, playing both roles in a story about an American 
boy, Mickey, and a classmate from India that he taunts and then befriends. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Paz, a professional storyteller, is part folklorist, part moralist, part 
stand-up comic. The fables he invents weave lessons of cultural tolerance into 
adventure tales. And when their giggles subside, he said, children get the 
message. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickey, for instance, chides the boy from India for wearing a turban, but then 
becomes enthralled when the boy presents him with a book on India that shows 
children riding elephants. As an adult, Mickey visits India and wears a turban 
to ward off the scalding heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other stories De La Paz performs, it evokes the exotic but brings it 
close to home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially in our area, because we have such a distinct group of children, 
it's important for them to learn about other cultures so they can accept each 
other," said Barfield Principal Terri Mora, whose school is about 65% Latino 
and 35% black with a few Hawaiian, Vietnamese American and Korean American 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes with stories, kids have a better understanding than (with) me 
lecturing them," Mora said. "They internalize the message from the story and 
then they remember it." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Paz reassures children that their feelings and problems are valid. A 
song, "Fifth-Grade Blues," describes the worst day in the life of a 
fifth-grader. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want kids to know that some adults know that they have trouble in school," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Claremont resident began telling stories as a bedtime ritual for his 
stepdaughter. She would spin a globe and he'd spin a tale about the country her 
finger landed on. 
</P>
<P>
 Later he approached her principal at the Jane Warner School in Altadena and 
asked to perform for the students. That went over so well that she asked him to 
return as a music and drama teacher. Since then he has pieced together a living 
telling stories, giving animation workshops for children and playing original 
songs. A graduate of Art Center's film department, he hopes to make 
multicultural children's films and is working on a screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
 Without preaching, De La Paz tries to impart empathy to the children he 
teaches and performs for, drawing on his own unusual background to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in New York City to a Cuban mother and Panamanian father, the 39-year-old 
De La Paz said, "Spanish was my first language, culturally I was African 
American and I grew up in a white society. I grew up on the Beatles and I grew 
up on samba." 
</P>
<P>
 A visit to his grandparents in Cuba turned into a three-year exile when, at 
the age of 6, he was trapped during the Bay of Pigs invasion and refused exit 
by Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing what it is like on the other side of American missiles gave him 
insight into what the people of Iraq experienced during Desert Storm, and he 
sets some stories there to counteract negative stereotypes from the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 By getting children to laugh about their prejudices, he works at dispelling 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "One kid told me after a show, 'I thought guys in turbans only blew up 
things,' " he said. "I said, 'All I've ever blown up is a balloon.' "

COVER STORY; DRAFTED INTO SERVICE; SOME SAY MANDATORY COMMUNITY WORK FOR 
STUDENTS TEACHES VALUES, BUT OTHERS CONSIDER IT FORCED LABOR

 Working at an orphanage in Mexico would qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 So would making quilts for a battered women's shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 But singing in the glee club, raking your neighbor's leaves or playing on a 
sports team probably would not. 
</P>
<P>
 As spring semester enters high gear, educators at Temple City Unified School 
District are compiling a list of projects students can undertake this fall, 
when the district institutes a new graduation requirement that pupils complete 
100 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple City is believed to be the second district in Los Angeles County to 
require community service, a trend hotly debated among national educators. The 
first was South Pasadena Unified School District, which requires 45 hours of 
community service. At least three other school districts in the San Gabriel 
Valley are studying such programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea has become increasingly popular as educators fear traditional 
education has failed to teach students citizenship and values. As families 
shatter and society fragments, many believe that instilling a sense of shared 
community is as important as teaching the three Rs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This teaches the value of service, linking what kids learn in the classroom 
with what they do later in life," said Clint Taylor, superintendent of Temple 
City Unified. "It is more than the traditional lesson in the classroom; it's an 
actual encounter with someone or some agency that needs help and the reward for 
the student is that much greater." 
</P>
<P>
 But the concept has its critics, who fear schools may be legislating morality 
and wonder who will decide whether students will be able to volunteer at 
Operation Rescue or at a nonprofit abortion clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some parents say, 'My son plays football and he should get 
community service credit for entertaining the community,' " said Janice 
Murasko, a Temple City High School teacher who is drafting the district's 
community service program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have some gray areas," she said. "Some of these things are going to be 
really difficult to decide . . . We're going to have to deal with them when 
they come up." 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime English teacher, Murasko became hooked on the concept of community 
service last year after reading about it in Teaching Tolerance, a national 
magazine for educators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept bugging my principal until he said, 'Form a committee.' I never 
dreamed it would get this far but it just kept rolling." 
</P>
<P>
 Murasko, 37, quickly got the project off the ground. She obtained grants from 
the Berger Foundation in Arcadia and from Kaiser Permanente. The grants paid 
for curriculum development, part of her salary and printing brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 She visited other districts to evaluate their programs. And she attended a 
three-day educational conference on community service in San Mateo. This fall 
the district is freeing her up from teaching to run the program full time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Murasko now spends her days visiting classrooms to explain the concept, lining 
up organizations that need help and conferring with students, faculty and 
parents about what types of activities should constitute community service. 
Currently, students can volunteer at about 50 organizations -- among them, 
Habitat for Humanity, AIDS Project Pasadena and the Humane Society -- or can 
get approval for a self-designed project. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple City educators also want to use the community service program to build 
self-esteem among at-risk students and have been working with local businesses 
to organize training programs. Murasko said Home Depot has agreed to train 
students in carpentry, plumbing and painting. The students will then be paired 
with a community volunteer and sent to make minor repairs at the homes of needy 
senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Although launched after South Pasadena's program, Temple City's project is 
significantly different. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena requires students to turn in a form -- signed by a supervisor 
-- verifying they have completed their required hours of community service. 
Temple City envisions a more demanding program. Murasko wants to incorporate 
the community service requirement into social studies classes by making 
students write essays or keep journals about their experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think organized reflection is one of the most important things; you have 
to allow time for it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of incorporating community service into the education system was 
first proposed in a 1983 report by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement 
of Teaching in Princeton, N.J., as a way to promote citizenship and give 
students a sense of civic responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 200 schools nationwide -- both public and private -- require 
community service and thousands more run voluntary service projects, according 
to the National Center for Service Learning in Early Adolescence, a research 
program at the City University of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Schools in St. Louis require 240 hours. In Detroit, students must complete 200 
hours. Laguna Beach Unified School District requires 40 hours. In 1992, 
Maryland became the first state to require all high school students to perform 
75 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
 But community service has also sparked controversy. Maryland's decision came 
in spite of heavy opposition from the state teachers' union, principals, 
superintendents, parents and students. Some argued it would create more 
paperwork for schools already suffocating in red tape. Others said it could 
penalize needy students, who might have to work after school. There was also 
concern over insurance liability when students work off campus and concerns 
that such work would infringe on the school day. 
</P>
<P>
 Some educators also objected to making it a requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "To mandate something that is a volunteer activity is Orwellian," said Sandra 
Stotsky, a research associate at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. 
"Community service is something that comes from within you, and if it's 
mandated, it's not really service, it's a chore, and I could see it turning 
kids off." 
</P>
<P>
 Others said community service could pose problems if it intersects with 
religion and politics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Who decides what is legitimate service and which activities, projects and 
organizations are included?" asked Chester E. Finn Jr., a professor of 
education at Vanderbilt University and a former assistant secretary of 
education in the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a very sensitive issue, because what will strike one person as 
legitimate will strike another as political or religious," Finn said. "What if 
someone says, 'I want to do my volunteer service in an abortion clinic, or 
trying to help Operation Rescue shut down abortion clinics.' Should this really 
be allowed to count for school credit?" 
</P>
<P>
 Others make strong arguments for community service programs. Andrew Furco, a 
research associate with the National Center for Research in Vocational 
Education at UC Berkeley, said such programs, when integrated into the 
curriculum, enhance academic performance, self-esteem and career awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 Furco, who is assessing the effects of community service programs, said a 1989 
study by the National Center on Effective Secondary Schools in Madison, Wis., 
found that students engaged in community service showed improved 
problem-solving skills and factual knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The outcome varies from student to student," said Furco. "It can affect them 
in intangible ways and sometimes the outcomes don't really manifest themselves 
until five or 10 years later." 
</P>
<P>
 Erin Nakayama, 17, is already reaping gains from community service at South 
Pasadena High School. A senior, she has been volunteering at Huntington 
Memorial Hospital in Pasadena since she was 14. She long ago racked up her 
requisite 45 hours but continues as a candy striper because "it makes me feel 
good to help out." 
</P>
<P>
 Nakayama, who delivers dinner trays to patients, answers phones and dons 
surgical scrubs to work with sterile hospital equipment, estimates she has 
logged more than 200 hours at the hospital. She believes all schools should 
mandate community service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a good idea. People should be willing to give up their time to 
help out, because it makes you a well-rounded person," Nakayama said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, community organizations also embrace the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Reynolds, who coordinates student volunteers at Huntington Memorial, 
describes the South Pasadena students as bright, open and a boon to the 
hospital staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time they run an errand for someone it frees up a nursing person to 
care for a patient," said Reynolds, who supervises about 20 students from South 
Pasadena High School. 
</P>
<P>
 For Shirley Chien, 18, doing community service at the South Pasadena Library 
three years ago led to a part-time job as a library clerk. Now a student at Cal 
State Los Angeles, she is mulling a career as a children's librarian. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I thought that community service was sort of silly, but then when 
you start you realize it's an opportunity to get work experience," Chien said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some students embrace community service, others find it a doctrinaire 
drain on their time. 
</P>
<P>
 "School's hard enough. Why should I have to go mow someone's lawn when I have 
plenty of my own schoolwork to do?" said Chris Proffit, 17, a South Pasadena 
High School student. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it should be optional," said Bianca Quintero, 14. "It's good for the 
community and everything but a lot of kids just don't want to do it; most of us 
are really busy." 
</P>
<P>
 In South Pasadena, where the program has been in place for at least six years, 
many parents -- including the president of the Parent-Teacher Assn. -- support 
community service. The 3.5-square-mile community is tightknit and has a long 
tradition of volunteerism. Many parents are active on civic and charity boards. 
Even the police chief volunteers in an adult literary program. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials praise the program. "It's been part of the fiber of the 
community for years," said Anita Thompson, South Pasadena Unified's assistant 
superintendent for instructional services. "This gets kids off the street, 
gives them something to do. We know from self-esteem studies that when you 
assist others you gain an appreciation of yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 But while some South Pasadena students get credit for delivering meals to the 
disabled or reading to the blind, others can fulfill the same requirement by 
working on their school homecoming or managing a sports team -- activities that 
some students are not sure enhance the community or their own education. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Dorris, 15, said he helped set up the South Pasadena Fair but did not 
apply that to his community service requirement. "I could have gotten credit . 
. . but I didn't do it for that. It hasn't helped me learn anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at South Pasadena can submit their own proposals for community 
service, which school officials approve if they are deemed appropriate. Erika 
Weingarten, 15, who is interested in politics, said she received credit for 
volunteer work she did for Democratic candidates during two recent elections. 
Weingarten staffed phone banks and worked with computer mailing lists, which 
she said taught her employment skills. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the program's ready welcome among parents in South Pasadena, 
Temple City is already fielding some complaints, although Murasko said they are 
few. One critic is Jeffrey Aemmer, who has an 11th-grader and a seventh-grader 
in Temple City schools. He said the district has no right to require his 
children to do community service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their job is to educate my children," Aemmer said. "Community service, that's 
my job. My children are already involved with community activities like Scouts 
and the church." 
</P>
<P>
 Aemmer questioned district plans to tie volunteer work to social studies 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing they use to hype their program is to tie it into curriculum, but I 
find it difficult to believe that putting a gallon of paint over graffiti on a 
freeway wall relates to curriculum," Aemmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murasko said requiring community service can raise some hackles, but said most 
of the resistance vanishes once parents and students learn their wide variety 
of choices. 
</P>
<P>
 When first told about the program, one high school student feared he would 
have to wear an orange vest and go pick up trash on the highway. He was so 
upset he started a petition to rescind the program. 
</P>
<P>
 But after Murasko explained the program in depth, the youth became 
enthusiastic and announced he wanted to design his own project. This fall, the 
student will fulfill his requirement by giving art lessons to senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can work out almost anything within reason," Murasko said. "Our philosophy 
is that a kid has to serve in their area of interest or you're defeating the 
purpose."

EDUCATION: DEBATE OVER BOND ISSUE AND A LESSON ON HIGH SCHOOLS IN SAN GABRIEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am a seventh-grade student at Jefferson Intermediate School and will be in 
the second class to go through Gabrielino High School. Myself and other 
students are ashamed of the members of our community who have been campaigning 
against the bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you like it or not, or whether the bond passes or not, there is going 
to be a high school. Don't you want it to be the best it can be? What have we 
done that gives you the right to take away our hope and future? Someone before 
you paid for your education. Why can't you do the same for us? 
</P>
<P>
 Since unification of the district, the music program has been reinstated in 
the elementary and intermediate school levels. I now play two instruments, and 
many other students have benefited from the new program as well. None of this, 
or any other of our recent and future improvements, would be possible without 
unification.

 Another high school in San Gabriel is not needed. The residents of San Gabriel 
living within the San Gabriel Unified School District have been told by the 
school board that they will run the school bond issue for a new high school 
over and over again until the voters get tired of fighting it. On Tuesday, it 
will be on the ballot again. 
</P>
<P>
 There is already an excellent San Gabriel High School under the direction of 
the Alhambra City High School District. The district has been allocated $25.7 
million in state funds for expansions and improvements of San Gabriel High. In 
addition, the school has been awarded a state grant of more than $82,000 for 
instructional technology. This will help our students be better prepared for 
the 21st Century. All this will not cost the San Gabriel taxpayers any 
additional tax. 
</P>
<P>
 How sad it is that the San Gabriel school board wants to pull our students 
away from this fine school and deprive them of the superior curriculum at San 
Gabriel High and offer them a limited choice of classes. All six of my children 
attended San Gabriel High and received an excellent education.

MONTEREY PARK: COST OF CONTRACTOR SELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, I read a letter to the editor regarding the use of the 
renovated El Encanto facility in the city of Monterey Park.The criticism of the 
possible uses was one thing, but I know some of the facts were missing. When 
the selection of the contractor first came before the City Council, it was 
Councilman Fred Balderrama who exposed the contractor's poor performance record 
and protested their "D"-rated bond. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later, the contractor failed to do his job and now it is costing 
the taxpayers an additional $200,000. This thanks to Councilman Sam Kiang, who 
made the motion to grant the contract to the less-qualified contractor.

MEDIA: TWO VIEWS OF NEW SECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am writing to you to respond to the new "magazine" section in my Thursday 
L.A. Times. Although you call it "new" and "exciting," etc., it is another 
example where we are given less, while having it called more. 
</P>
<P>
 I really enjoyed reading the San Gabriel Valley section on Thursday and 
Sunday. You have had interesting feature stories on the area, some of which I 
frequently sent to my brother-in-law who recently moved to Denver and who grew 
up in Glendora. I enjoyed the coverage because I live in Pomona and work in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "Greatly disappointed" is the way I would describe myself upon seeing the new 
Thursday magazine. Since we no longer receive local coverage on Sundays, it has 
to make up for two good-size sections. The magazine format seems much more 
abbreviated and edited. Most of the stories do not extend beyond the first page 
of the story at all -- the articles seem much shorter! 
</P>
<P>
 I really wish you would reconsider this move. Yes, we sometimes get a San 
Gabriel story in the Metro section, etc., but the old two days per week section 
was greatly superior in length and breadth of the articles. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Your new format of magazine/tabloid came again this morning. I am impressed by 
the way these sections make reading more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 Seems to me both the news articles and the ads are more "smaller town" types 
that speak to me, who's been a big-city resident for 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you for the freshness.

THEATER REVIEW; PRODUCTION'S TENOR IS FARCE AND FURIOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ken Ludwig's hit Broadway farce "Lend Me a Tenor" borrows from the French 
farceur Feydeau but doesn't have the master's obligatory seven doors. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only five in the 1934 Cleveland hotel suite where the action takes 
place, surrounding a performance of the Cleveland Grand Opera that barely 
misses being a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The play is also missing a couple of the cylinders that help fuel a true 
farce. There are some dull moments not filled with mayhem, and a couple of gags 
run out of gas. 
</P>
<P>
 But this production on the Long Beach Playhouse's main stage has advantages 
that help keep the engine running in a laugh-provoking gear. 
</P>
<P>
 One is the bright tempo that director Darlene Hunter-Chaffee keeps constant. 
She has also been able to infuse her cast with the spirit of having fun, a 
feeling that spills into the audience. The actors look like they're having a 
ball -- a comic ingredient that never misses. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast has also been held in check and never tries to make anything funny. 
They are so sincere in their every moment that Ludwig's humor is allowed full 
sway. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important to the production's success are the three central figures: 
Saunders (Ray Fulmer), general manager of the Grand Opera; his gofer and 
assistant Max (Jonathan Kass), and the visiting Italian tenor Tito Merelli 
(John Del Gatto). There is no misstep in their performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Kass has that sure comic sense that never allows his audience to see him being 
comic. He is funny without losing his romantic appeal in a role that requires 
these opposites. 
</P>
<P>
 Fulmer's calm authority even when his character is at the end of his rope also 
hides a sure technique, and Del Gatto's volatile tenor maintains a semblance of 
sanity in spite of the insanity around him. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, though both Kass and Del Gatto obviously are not opera singers, they 
approximate same with daring and aplomb during the Don Carlo aria with which 
Merelli coaches the tyro Max. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Gordon is delightful as Saunders' daughter Maggie, who really loves Max 
but is seething to gain experience with Merelli. Mark Schuliger makes 
opera-buff Bellhop a charming, amusing thorn in everybody's side. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Jackson as the soprano who is supposed to sing opposite Merelli, but 
winds up with Max, Leslie Allen as the chair of the Opera Guild, and Giovanna 
Fusco as Tito's fiery, jealous wife, all handle their chores brightly and with 
flair. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Kokol's set achieves a triumph of its own on the playhouse's long thrust 
stage, looking just right as a period hotel suite and giving the actors' mad 
dashings enough distance to make their panic seem real.

 San Gabriel resident Frank Bermel is the first donor from the American Red 
Cross Blood Services Southern California Region to make 100 blood platelet 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
 The platelet donation is a two-hour process in which blood is drawn from the 
donor's arm and separated to isolate the platelets. The remaining components 
are returned to the donor in the other arm. The platelets are used to treat 
leukemia and aid patients undergoing chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 A semi-retired data processor, Bermel has been a donor since December, 1980, 
and donates platelets about once a month.

 300TH WIN 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Yanez showed little emotion March 30 after registering his 300th win as 
coach of Downey High's baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's done," Yanez said after the Vikings edged Loyola, 3-2, in pool play at 
the St. Paul tournament at La Mirada High. "I kind of clapped my hands. I don't 
jump up and down too much. I kept it pretty low-key. (The players) each shook 
my hand and congratulated me. It was nice. They were as much on edge as I was." 
</P>
<P>
 Yanez, 50, in his 27th season as Viking skipper, has led his team to three San 
Gabriel Valley league titles and 12 playoff appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just do it one year at a time," he said. "All of a sudden it was 25 
years. Now I'm coaching kids whose fathers played for me. In fact one of the 
fathers who was there (Wednesday) was on the team when we won our first game."  
</P>
<P>
 Yanez said he was unaware of how many games he had won until two seasons ago 
when his wife, Kathleen, reminded him to check the records.  
</P>
<P>
 "I counted all the score books from all 25 years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Yanez said his goal is to win 301, which he isn't taking for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've kind of fallen on hard times the last couple of years," Yanez said of 
the Vikings (6-7, 1-2 in league). "But I think we're going to make a comeback. 
We're playing really well right now." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 How well Downey is playing will be tested Friday when the 49ers face Gahr, the 
No. 1 team in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Gahr (10-2-1) played to a 4-4 tie with Diamond Bar in the final of the Santa 
Ana tournament March 30 when the game was called after 10 innings because of 
darkness. In the tournament, Gahr posted wins over Trabuco Hills, 8-2, Villa 
Park, 8-4, and Pacifica, 7-1. Gladiator junior Chuck Lopez was named the 
tournament's most valuable player. In the four games, the right fielder went 
six for 12, with a homer, three runs batted in, two doubles, four stolen bases 
and two walks. 
</P>
<P>
 Several major league scouts have been taking a close look at Gahr senior 
left-hander George Castillo. Gladiator Coach Tom Bergeron said scouts from the 
Seattle Mariners and the Major League Scouting Bureau have watched Castillo 
pitch. This season, Castillo is 5-0 with 44 strikeouts, three walks, and has an 
0.20 earned-run average in 34 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Bergeron thinks his ace hurler needs more development before turning 
pro. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect him to go to college," Bergeron said. "He's a couple years away. 
He's a good kid, but doesn't have the grades to get a scholarship (to a 
four-year school). He knows he's going to go to a JC. Cerritos and Fullerton 
want him. He'll probably go to one of those two schools." 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Gabriel Valley league opener this season, Castillo had 12 
strikeouts and no walks in a two-hit 1-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his first year as Gladiator coach in 1972, Bergeron, 55, has had five 
players make the major leagues: Danny Boone (San Diego Padres, Houston Astros), 
Tommy Nieto (World Series rings with St. Louis Cardinal and Minnesota Twins), 
Al Osuna (Astros, recently traded to Dodgers), Brett Barberie (Florida Marlins) 
and Shane Mack (Minnesota Twins). 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeron's children are having their own baseball success. Greg plays second 
base for Loyola Marymount. Also playing second base, for New Mexico, is Renee. 
Sherri is a pitcher/first baseman for Los Alamitos High. ANOTHER HONOR 
</P>
<P>
 Jelani Gardner, a 6-foot-6 guard from St. John Bosco, has been named to the 
All-Southern Section team. Gardner had already been selected as Southern 
Section Division II player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 During his senior season, Gardner, a point guard, averaged 25.7 points and six 
assists and led the Braves to the I-AA championship over Dominguez. He has 
narrowed his college choices to UCLA, Arkansas and Cal and will announce his 
decision on April 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Gardner on the Southern Section team are two members of the Long Beach 
Poly Jackrabbits: senior forward Zerrick Campbell, who will attend the 
University of San Francisco, and James Brown, a junior guard and one of five 
underclassmen on the 15-member first team. Mater Dei senior Miles Simon was 
selected the Division I-A Player of the Year. Simon's Monarch teammate and St. 
John Bosco transfer, Schea Cotton, was selected to the first team. Long Beach 
Wilson junior Michael Batiste was named to the second team. The teams are 
selected by a panel of sportswriters and is sponsored by the Amateur Athletic 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Poly basketball player Zarrick Campbell has given an unwritten 
commitment to the University of San Francisco. LONG BEACH STATE 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach State baseball team will play a three-game series this weekend 
against No. 1 ranked Cal State Fullerton (26-6, 5-1 in the Big West Conference) 
at Blair Field. Game times are 7:05 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 1:05 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers (23-7, 4-2 in the Big West Conference), who are ranked No. 7 
nationally by Collegiate Baseball Magazine, completed a three-game Big West 
home sweep of New Mexico on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlighting Long Beach State's 6-5 victory Saturday was Rolondo Avila's steal 
of home in the sixth inning that gave the 49ers a 6-4 lead. Avila leads the Big 
West with 25 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Avila, a 5-foot-8, 170-pound junior center fielder, was named Big 
West player of the week. During the week he had three triples, reached base 
seven times in 13 plate appearances, scored five runs and stole five bases in 
five attempts. Avila, who came from Harbor College and Paramount High, leads 
the team in runs scored with 28.  
</P>
<P>
 Before the close game on Saturday, the 49ers had easily handled the Aggies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 5-0 victory Thursday, senior right-hander Mike Fontana (7-0, 2.22 ERA) 
gave up two hits, struck out eight and walked four in pitching a complete game. 
Senior second baseman Eric Martins scored two runs and right fielder Ramon 
Smith went 3-for-4 with an RBI. On Friday, right-hander Scott Rivette and 
Andrew Wise combined for a five-hitter to lead Long Beach to a 7-3 victory. 
Rivette (6-1) pitched five innings, gave up four hits, three runs, one earned, 
and struck out four. Normally the setup man for 49er reliever Gabe Gonzalez, 
the 6-foot-1, 200-pound Wise came on with a runner on base in the sixth and 
gave up only one hit and struck out two the rest of the way. First baseman Kirk 
Pierce went 3-for-4 with an RBI, Martins got two hits and drove in two, and 
shortstop Ryan Miller continued his hot hitting with a two-run home run. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach State women's softball team swept a doubleheader Saturday 
against Pacific in a Big West matchup. In the opener, senior right-hander Stacy 
Van Essen (6-8) pitched a three-hitter in a 1-0 win. Kristin Frady's sacrifice 
fly in the bottom of the sixth accounted for all the scoring. In the second 
game, the 49ers had 13 hits in a 14-5 victory. Freshman right-hander Christy 
Tucker (4-2) gave up eight hits to earn the victory. The 18th-ranked 49ers 
(19-15, 6-6 in Big West) will play a doubleheader Saturday at New Mexico State 
beginning at noon. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Danielle Scott, the 1993 Division I volleyball player of the year and an 
All-Big West first-team basketball player, participated in her first collegiate 
track meet at the UC Irvine Quadrangular on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike another famous athlete trying to play a new sport, Scott had immediate 
success. The 6-2 senior took first place in the long jump with a leap of 17-3 
3/4. She also came in third in the high jump at 5 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49er women's team won the meet with 72 points. Irvine and Santa Barbara 
had 45 and Cal State Fullerton had six. Long Beach State senior Stacy Pando 
stood out by winning the 1,500 meters at 4 minutes 39.51 seconds, and the 800 
meters at 2:15.66. Teammate Laite Pale won the discus competition with a toss 
of 131-3. She also won the shotput with a put of 40-1 1/2. Le'Gretta Hinds of 
Long Beach State won the 100-meter hurdles in 13.88 and the 400 hurdles in 
1:00.14. COMMUNITY COLLEGE 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos' baseball team advanced to the final of the Allan Hancock tournament 
in Santa Maria last weekend before losing to the host school, 5-2. On the road 
to the championship game, Cerritos beat Cuesta, 4-3, in the first round and 
Harbor, 9-5, in the second round. MISCELLANY 
</P>
<P>
 Some 6,000 athletes from around the world, including elite cyclists, 
duathletes, 5K road racers and in-line skaters, will take part in the inaugural 
Ride, Run & Roll Grand Prix Sports Festival on Friday through Sunday at the 
Grand Prix of Long Beach race circuit and Long Beach Convention Center. The 
events come a week before the Grand Prix of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival includes 18 competitive events beginning with dual slalom 
mountain bike races Friday at 6 p.m. in the Long Beach Arena. The schedule 
resumes Saturday at 7:30 a.m. with events such as amateur and professional 
duathalon (run/bike/run) competition and 5K races for men, women and pros. 
Amateur and professional cyclists will race at the Grand Prix course on Sunday 
beginning at 10 a.m. Expected to take part is Chris Huber of Scotts Valley, 
Calif., the world's fastest cyclist. Entry forms for all open events can be

THEATER REVIEW; 'BEYOND THERAPY' STILL GETS LAUGHS, BUT ITS TOPIC SHRINKS A BIT 
WITH AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Popular entertainment abounds with absurdist portraits of psychiatrists, who 
rank right up there with lawyers and politicians as objects of theatrical 
ridicule. But few spoofs lampoon psychiatry with more impudence than 
Christopher Durang's comedic sendup "Beyond Therapy," currently at the Basement 
Theatre in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Basement stage, the subterranean venue of the First Congregational Church, 
has been transformed from its formerly cavernous and murky space into a much 
more hospitable, cozy 49-seat theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beyond Therapy" -- which centers on two psychiatric patients and their 
egregiously psycho shrinks -- is farcical and silly on the surface. But it's 
really poised to be a wicked satire of sex and psychiatry that requires a light 
touch to pull off. In this instance, director Brett Grindle, who last year 
successfully staged another and considerably more difficult absurdist work at 
the Basement (Ionesco's "Rhinoceros"), comes up with a moderately funny but 
uneven production. 
</P>
<P>
 Durang, who writes with a collegiate-like precociousness, is the playwright 
who spoofed movie genres and screen stars in "A History of the American Film" 
and showed little mercy for parochial education in "Sister Mary Ignatius 
Explains It All for You." 
</P>
<P>
 But his signature black humor in "Beyond Therapy," which segued from 
off-Broadway to Broadway 12 years ago (then closed after two weeks), has lost 
some of its freshness. The writing spins off the self-indulgences of the 1970s' 
"Me Decade," but the territory seems a little frayed and old hat today. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot is almost too symmetrical for its own good. Both Prudence (Kathryn 
Bundy) and Bruce (Thomas Richard Sheppard) are therapy addicts. Prudence's 
therapist (Harvey Cohen, ably stepping in as an alternate) encourages her to be 
assertive. Bruce's therapist (Patricia Marina) doesn't comprehend that her 
client is gay and persuades him to meet a woman by placing a personal ad. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem is that Bruce's lover (David G. Robinson) is coiled to 
retaliate. But Bruce places the ad anyway and you can almost guess the rest. 
When the emotionally wrought patients Prudence and Bruce (who are not nearly as 
sick as their doctors) do finally meet in a snooty New York restaurant, they 
run smack into their psychiatrists in a well-staged Marx Brothers bit of farce 
that is the physical highlight of the show. Check out the aloof waiter 
(stone-faced Pojin Sven).  
</P>
<P>
 Some of Durang's lines still resonate -- one character describes Chekhov as 
"psychic suffering in the right frame of mind" -- but other lines sink: "Men 
who prefer oral sex," says Marina's crazed female shrink, "may wish to return 
to the womb." 
</P>
<P>
 The playing veers from the bland to the hyper, but Bundy as the lightly giddy, 
comparably sane Prudence character is the show's singularly accomplished 
performance. Bundy, in fact, is such a charmer she reminds you of a latter-day 
Irene Dunne or Claudette Colbert. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Beyond Therapy," Basement Theatre, 464 E. Walnut St., Pasadena, Thursday 
through Saturday, 8 p.m., Sunday matinee, April 10, 1 p.m. Ends April 30. $12 
to $10. (818) 683-1651. Running time: 1 hour, 45 minutes.

EDUCATION: EFFORTS TO REVIVE COMPTON DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Feb. 1, 1994, Dr. J. Jerome Harris, the new state-appointed administrator 
for the Compton Unified School District came aboard. I think we owe it to our 
children to give Dr. Harris an opportunity to implement a system to complete 
the efforts already begun to revive the Compton Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district is on a long but optimistic road to recovery. Although it 
has been only months since the state intervened to save the district from 
financial and academic ruin, there have been significant improvements. To 
reduce expenditures, there have been major reductions in a previously top-heavy 
management staff. And serious efforts have been made to discover other 
cost-reducing solutions as well. Salary and hiring freezes have been imposed. 
Some projects have been trimmed while others have been postponed in order to 
lessen the adverse affects of budget cutbacks and the risk of more staff 
reductions. Other budget-reduction measures include cuts in management 
salaries, monitoring of overtime, elimination of outside printing, and the 
postponement or cancellation of capital expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 Simultaneously, there are a number of areas being tapped for revenue. Under an 
agreement signed by the school district with the city of Compton and Compton 
Community College, the district will receive 30% or approximately $30 million 
over the next 40 years from the city's Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possible resource is district property. A study is underway to 
determine whether the district might benefit from the consolidation, lease 
and/or sale of some of its properties. It is important to point out that all 
revenue collected from the use of district property is mandated by law to be 
used for the rehabilitation and renovation of school sites. Monies are not to 
be funneled to the state through some conspiracy as frequently implied by a 
certain Compton school board member. Also, the district has been paying large 
tax penalties for vacant property at which building projects were never 
started. This is a tremendous waste of money -- the kind of thing any competent 
board would have rectified. 
</P>
<P>
 We have received numerous calls from parents and other community supporters 
thanking us for our intervention. In fact, the Jan. 25 edition of the Wave 
Newspaper quotes Alyce Bennett, a violence prevention counselor for numerous 
Compton elementary and middle schools as having said, "We created this 
situation. The state never would have come in if we didn't allow our school 
standards to slide." In the same article, Acting Supt. Harold Cebrun agreed, 
stating, "We allowed ourselves to become so weak the state had to come into the 
district." Also, the students I have spoken with are grateful for our help and 
now believe there is once again hope that they might have a chance at a quality 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has supported my efforts 
to rescue our children. The students, after all, must be our first priority.

 RIGHT TURN: Justice Harry Blackmun is leaving the Supreme Court (A1), which, 
according to David Gurnick, head of the San Fernando Valley Bar Assn., will 
probably mean a shift to the right. Gurnick says Blackmun has helped provide 
stability in the court, and that President Clinton should appoint someone who 
can act as a "moderate consensus builder" to work out disputes among other 
justices. 
</P>
<P>
 LAST MINUTE: We live on a planet of procrastinators, especially when we owe 
money. So it's no surprise that many Valley residents, eight days before the 
April 15 deadline, have yet to file their taxes. But because of the quake, it 
seems traffic is even slower than usual. . . . "They just want to be sure they 
have all the right information together," said an administrative assistant for 
H&R Block in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 EINSTEIN: There's a science to everything these days, even volleyball. Just 
ask Lian Kang Lu (above), coach of the CSUN women's squad, who believes there's 
a proper technique that must be followed in all phases of the game. . . . 
"Everything I teach is like a little block," he explains, "and it takes many, 
many blocks to make up a big building." (C8) 
</P>
<P>
 STOLEN FAVORITES: Air bags are hot items these days. For thieves, that is, who 
are swiping them like crazy (A1). . . . But the biggest target in the car 
remains the stereo, says Detective Dexter Owens, who heads the LAPD's West 
Valley auto theft division. Other items high on the list are cellular phones, 
tapes and briefcases. Briefcases? "They're very professional looking," Owens 
said, "and many people keep laptops in there." 
</P>
<P>
 TOWN METTLE: The people of Castaic were concerned about big city violence 
invading their small town, so they did something about it. The school district 
purchased a metal detector at its middle school one year ago this month, and so 
far, it's paid off. . . . Only about half a dozen suspensions have come from 
the checks (B9). Michael Arkush

 "It's becoming much more commonplace in urban areas throughout the country, 
specifically on the East and West Coast," said Steven Goldstein, vice president 
of the New York-based Insurance Information Institute, a national trade group 
representing property and casualty insurance carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 The thefts for sale to unscrupulous auto repair shops were first reported in 
Detroit in late 1992, and in the last six months the thefts have popped up in 
Los Angeles, New York, St. Louis and several New Jersey cities, Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are just no statistics available yet because it's a relatively new 
crime," Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Southern California, from Long Beach to Santa Clarita, thieves are 
stealing the safety devices, which can cost up to $1,200, from cars parked in 
driveways, parking lots and even auto dealerships, police say. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, thieves in search of air bags have robbed the Thousand Oaks 
Auto Mall twice in the last two months, stealing between eight and 10 of the 
devices during each robbery, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to be a new trend that's developing," said Ventura County Sheriff's 
Sgt. Jerry Weaver. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the trend apparently has not yet reached parts of west Ventura 
County. Authorities in Oxnard and Ventura said they could not recall any 
instances of air bags being stolen from dealerships or private owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Thieves also took about 15 air bags from cars at two auto dealerships in the 
west San Fernando Valley over the last four months, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exploded," said LAPD Detective Mike Lewin, describing the popularity 
among car thieves. "Six months ago you didn't even hear about it. Now they're 
going through the roof," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto theft detectives in the Van Nuys and North Hollywood divisions report 
more than a dozen such thefts in the past month. 
</P>
<P>
 The air bags, which inflate rapidly but briefly to cushion the impact on the 
driver or passengers in crashes at 15 m.p.h. or more, were once installed 
solely in expensive luxury cars. But as they began to appear as standard 
equipment in less expensive new cars, the number of thefts rose with them. 
</P>
<P>
 The market for stolen air bags seems to be expanding as well. Police suspect 
that some professional auto thieves are in league with body shops and workers 
who want the bags at reduced rates because they need them to complete repairs 
on cars involved in accidents in which the factory-installed bag inflated. The 
bags work only once and cannot be reused. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto dismantlers buy the bags as salvage items with no questions asked, 
reselling them to repair shops and home mechanics for about half the cost of a 
new bag. In the case of a Mercedes or Lexus, the replacement cost is about 
$1,200, without installation charges. New bags for other makes run $800 to 
$1,200. 
</P>
<P>
 A body shop worker with a supply of stolen air bags can pocket the difference 
between what is paid to the thief -- perhaps about $150 -- and the $1,000 or 
more that is billed to an insurance company or car owner for a new bag, Lewin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The major risk for air bag thieves is that the devices are activated by a 
small charge of gunpowder that can be detonated by static electricity, although 
there have been no reports of such incidents, said Detective Bob Graybill, who 
heads the Valley-based Community Effort to Combat Auto Theft, known as CECATS. 
</P>
<P>
 In tests conducted at an auto theft investigators' school operated by the 
LAPD, the bags, when inflated, rocketed up to 70 feet in the air, Detective Gil 
Hetrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it deployed while you had a bottle of soda pop, it would shove it right 
through your face," Hetrick said. "It would be like Mike Tyson hitting you 
right in the face." 
</P>
<P>
 When a motion detector senses the impact of the crash, it detonates a 
gunpowder-chemical charge, creating a cloud of gas that instantly snaps the 
balloon-like bag open. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Treinen, president of Special Devices Inc., a Santa Clarita-based maker of 
the explosive "initiators" that trigger air bag deployment, agreed, saying the 
initiators can cause serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it would blow your arm off, but it would certainly blow a 
finger off if you didn't know what you were doing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Treinen also confirmed that static electricity could, in extreme cases, 
trigger the initiator. Treinen said his company expects to sell about 7 million 
of the devices in this fiscal year, and demand is growing. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say it is next to impossible to find crooked repair shop 
operators and prove that they violated the law by receiving stolen goods. But 
in at least one case, catching the alleged thieves was easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewin was on the trail of a stolen car ring working in the Valley on Dec. 3 
when he noticed three men trying to break into his unmarked police car in the 
parking lot of the Northridge Fashion Center mall. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrested them and later discovered that one of the suspects, Sang Van Tran, 
35, of North Hills, was the same man he was looking for in connection with the 
theft of five cars that had been resold to unwitting victims after their 
vehicle identification numbers were altered. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his arrest, Tran had an air bag, also thought to be stolen, 
Lewin said. Lewin matched the serial number of the air bag with the vehicle 
identification number of a car that had been burglarized at a Metrolink parking 
lot in the West Valley, one of a dozen from which air bags had been stolen. 
Tran, who has been charged with nearly a dozen crimes in two separate cases, is 
awaiting trial in Los Angeles Superior Court, Lewin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in Arlington, Va., reports that 91% 
of all 1994 vehicle models are equipped with air bags, according to the 
Automobile Club of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of high profit margins and such a large market will continue to 
drive up air bag thefts, said Goldstein and Detective J.R. Rolfe, an auto theft 
investigator at the Police Department's Devonshire Division. "If it's in a car 
and has some value, someone will try and take it," Rolfe said.

 WHO CARES? It's an ugly thought, but Thousand Oaks' annual awards for the most 
beautiful gas station, apartment complex and industrial center may soon fade 
away because of public apathy. . . . Councilman Frank Schillo thought the 
city-beautiful awards would encourage general sprucing up of homes or 
storefronts. But no one has applied in any of the categories this year. "Is 
anybody interested in this?" asks Schillo, who is running for county 
supervisor. "If not, I'm not going to spend my time on this. I've got a lot of 
other things I could be doing." 
</P>
<P>
 RAPID FIRE: The same folks criticized for threatening sea lions and dolphins 
with underwater test explosions now want to test-fire a huge Gatling gun next 
to elephant seal breeding grounds on San Nicolas Island (B1). . . . The Navy 
proposes setting up the big gun on the island 60 miles off the coast. Usually 
mounted on ships, the gun unleashes a torrent of armor-piercing bullets that 
can knock down an incoming missile. The state Coastal Commission was horrified 
at first, but now believes the test poses no serious risk to endangered 
species. 
</P>
<P>
 FLOWER STORM: Last year's wildfires have wiped the hillsides clean for an 
explosion of springtime wildflowers (Ventura County Life, Page 24). The burn 
areas in the Santa Monica Mountains boast dozens of varieties normally choked 
by the thick layer of chaparral. . . . Park rangers also report sightings of 
the rare chocolate lily. "We don't see it very often," Ranger Mark Boehler 
says. "But it's coming up in quite a few places." 
</P>
<P>
 PASS THE HAT: The helmets looked innocent enough, patina-on-bronze replicas of 
headgear worn by Greek Olympians 3,000 years ago. But when Oxnard City Council 
members opened the helmet boxes and found out each could be worth $3,000, they 
started a scramble to unload the gifts from a Korean businessman (B1). . . . 
"We simply can't accept gifts of that value, so we decided to donate it to the 
library," Councilman Michael Plisky said. Actually, public officials can accept 
gifts, but must declare items worth at least $50.

WHAT'S NEXT FOR BONDS; WHILE SOME BAIL OUT, OTHERS NIBBLE AT HIGHER YIELDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 The worst bond selloff in seven years has left many conservative investors in 
a quandary: Even as they count their losses, they're also looking at extremely 
enticing yields on fixed-income investments. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can handle the risk, experts say, this could be a good time to shop for 
bonds and other income-producing investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The surge in market interest rates in the first quarter sharply devalued older 
fixed-rate bonds and competing investments such as utility stocks. That 
devaluation showed up most prominently in bond mutual funds, which hold more 
than $700 billion of Americans' savings. 
</P>
<P>
 The average fund owning long-term U.S. government bonds tumbled 4.5% in price 
during the first quarter, according to fund-tracker Lipper Analytical Services 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 However, because government bond fund owners are earning interest at a 6.4% 
annualized rate, on average, the funds' "total return" -- interest earnings 
minus price loss -- was a negative 3.2% for the quarter. In other words, 
interest earned during the three months helped offset some of the price 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, that may not be much consolation to former bank CD holders who 
converted those CDs to bond funds last year. Mutual fund companies fear that 
many new bond fund owners weren't prepared to see any decline in their 
principal. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, most fund companies admit that their bond funds are experiencing net 
redemptions by shareholders for the first time in more than a year, as some 
spooked investors head for safer ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last two days, however, interest rates appear to have stabilized. And 
many Wall Streeters continue to insist that rates have overreacted to worries 
about inflation rising in a strengthening economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this bear market (in bonds) is at least three-quarters cooked" 
already, says William Gross, a veteran money manager at Pacific Investment 
Management Co. in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond has rocketed from 6.35% at 
year's end to 7.24% now. Shorter-term yields have risen even faster, in some 
cases. The five-year Treasury note yield, for example, is 6.42% now versus 
5.20% at year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if inflation is slightly higher this year than the 3% annualized rate of 
recent years, current bond yields more than compensate for that risk, Gross and 
other Wall Streeters say. Inflation is the chief threat to bonds, because it 
erodes the value of their fixed returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond mutual fund managers, trying to put the best face on the first-quarter 
debacle, also note that the deep price declines of some types of bonds and bond 
funds exaggerated the actual level of selling in those markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Thinly traded tax-exempt municipal bonds, for example, suffered some of the 
biggest losses in the quarter. But that was less a function of investors' 
desire to dump those bonds than of panicked brokerages' arbitrary decision to 
mark down the prices of their bond inventories, regardless of buy or sell 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Peabody, whose Alliance California Municipal bond fund has lost nearly 
10% of its value since year's end, said Wall Street's perception is that "when 
you go through these phases in bonds, everyone's a seller and there are no 
buyers." 
</P>
<P>
 But in most bond sectors, the truth is that there have been few buyers in 
recent weeks, as interest rates began to rocket and many players stepped aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, yields have reached levels where some investors have at least 
begun to nibble again. And for good reason, bond pros say. "In many cases the 
calendar has been rolled back a year or a couple of years" in terms of yields 
available, says Theresa Havell, manager of the Neuberger & Berman Limited 
Maturity bond fund in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the best strategy for income-seeking investors now? Some ideas: 
</P>
<P>
 * Stay with bond funds of intermediate term (five- to 10-year maturities) or 
short term (one- to five-year). Their share prices decline less than long-term 
fund shares when market interest rates rise. And with the recent yield surge, 
intermediate- and short-term funds may pay as much or more than long-term funds 
did three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * Buy Treasury notes or bonds directly. If you're a buy-and-hold investor, 
owning an individual Treasury bond means you can be sure of getting your money 
back at maturity, regardless of how its price fluctuates in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, because mutual funds are constantly trading bonds and have no set 
maturities, you may never recover a loss of principal in a fund if interest 
rates continue to rise in the years ahead. (However, a fund's yield also rises 
with market rates.) 
</P>
<P>
 Banks or discount brokers can help you buy Treasuries, if you don't have a 
broker. Or you can buy directly through the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look closely at tax-exempt muni bonds or funds. Because munis plunged so far 
in value in the first quarter, their yields now are particularly lucrative. 
</P>
<P>
 Peabody's Alliance fund, which owns long-term California munis, yields about 
5.85% now, up from 5.25% at year's end. The current 5.85% tax-free yield is the 
equivalent of a 9% yield on taxable bonds (such as Treasuries) for a 
Californian in the 34.7% combined federal/state tax bracket. For higher-income 
taxpayers, that taxable equivalent yield is even higher. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look for bond "substitutes" whose yields have risen with market interest 
rates. Electric utility stocks, for example, have been hammered lower this 
year, sending their annualized dividend yields well beyond 6%, for the most 
part. Utilities may no longer offer the same kind of annual dividend growth as 
they did in the 1980s, but at current yields they may still prove to be decent 
long-term investments for risk-tolerant investors, some experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 * MARKETS SETTLE DOWN: For the first time in nearly two weeks, stocks and 
bonds did not take investors on an emotional roller coaster ride, with the Dow 
Jones industrial average posting a slight gain and the 30-year Treasury bond 
yield closing unchanged. D2 A Losing Quarter for Bonds 
</P>
<P>
 Rising market interest rates devalued older fixed-rate bonds in the first 
quarter, which means bond mutual fund owners saw their share prices fall. 
Here's a look at the average price declines in key fund categories, compared 
with their average annualized yields. 03,23,25,18 Fund category 1st qtr.

</P>

 Investors searching for high current income have plenty of choices now, given 
the recent surge in interest rates and drop in stock prices. But many 
high-yielding investments also carry substantial risk -- as bond owners found 
out in the first quarter. 03,27,26,15 Investment Current annualized yield Risk

Q & A; INVESTOR SOUNDS THE WARNING FOR STOCK PULLOUT; POINTING TO MARKET 
CHANGES, HUNTINGTON BEACH NEWSLETTER SAYS NOW'S THE TIME TO SELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE MICHAUD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Douglas Fabian's investment newsletter told subscribers to get out of the 
stock market before the October, 1987, crash. And it told them to get out again 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Beach-based newsletter, Fabian's Investment Resource (formerly 
called the Telephone Switch), uses a mathematical formula to time the buy and 
sell decisions it recommends. It has been ranked No. 1 nationally in predicting 
major ups and downs in the stock market over the past 12 years by independent 
monitor Hulbert Financial Digest. 
</P>
<P>
 The newsletter is closely watched by its 35,000 subscribers, mostly small 
investors with about $1 billion in stocks and mutual funds. With the Dow having 
fallen nearly 200 points in the past two weeks, the question of whether to pull 
out of the market is foremost on the minds of those who pay $137 a year for his 
financial suggestions. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.32 points 
Wednesday, to close at 3,679.73. That's roughly 300 points below its Jan. 31 
high. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking from his shuttered third-floor office in a tone that often takes on 
the sound of a confidential whisper, Fabian shared some investment advice with 
Times staff writer Anne Michaud. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You sent the sell signal on Thursday, March 31? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Wednesday evening. Wednesday's market action is what caused us to go into a 
sell mode. Thursday was actually an "up" day in the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why did you advise people to sell? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm trying to get double-digit returns on my investments, and for that, the 
market is no longer safe. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the things we believe is that the market is really a reflection of 
people's emotions. So, individual investors who are using the stock market to 
try to attain double-digit returns have to have an approach to investing that 
controls their emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 So, we've been following the approach that my dad discovered during the 
'73-'74 recession. We sell when the market dips below its 39-week average. 
We're not big into the idea of switching often; we want to catch just the major 
trends. 
</P>
<P>
 We're very technically oriented to the market and the reason is we don't let 
our emotions get involved. We try to stay away from what our stomachs are 
telling us. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think that we're entering a bear market, where there is a decline of 
20% or more in the Standard & Poor 500? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The potential is very high, since the trend of the market has changed, that 
we're entering a bear market. It may be a 10% correction in a bull market, but 
the statistics lead me to believe that a bearish mode is advancing. 
</P>
<P>
 When you take a look at the historical averages, the domestic stock market has 
been outperforming its historical norm for the past 15 years. And when you go 
through a period of "overperformance," you go through a period of 
"underperformance" to bring yourself back down to the historical averages. The 
S&P 500, historically, compounds (grows) each year at an average of 10% to 11%. 
For the past 15 years, it's been compounding 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of the next issue of the newsletter, which will come out on Friday, 
is to prepare ourselves for investing in a bear market. 
</P>
<P>
 This market could just correct. The market has proved a lot of people wrong. 
But I'm preparing people for a bear market. If the market does turn up, we'll 
buy back in again in the next four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you invest during a bear market? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think that there are some excellent opportunities. A big question is if 
we go into a bear market whether it will be a worldwide bear market or just the 
United States. Japan has gone through a bear market. They've had a 50% decline. 
Now it has moved up about 25%, so perhaps the bear market is behind them. So, 
one of the markets that's appealing to us is Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the precious metals area is a good one during bear markets. That wasn't 
evident in '87; gold actually declined then. One of the reasons why was there 
was a liquidity squeeze. A lot of people were on margins (in which they had 
borrowed money from the brokerage to invest. It must be repaid on demand). 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you recommend investors do with their money when they pull out of 
the stock market? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Move into money market funds (mutual funds whose investments are high-yield 
money market instruments, such as federal securities, CDs and IOUs from major 
corporations). We've been fully invested (in stocks) 70% of the time during the 
past 17 years and 30% in the money market. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is the downturn in the market a sign of fundamental economic health of the 
country? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. As the October, 1987, market showed, we don't need to be in a recession 
to have a bear market. The S&P 500 was up last year and the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How are people reacting to your recommendation?

BUILDER, BANKER JOIN IN MAJOR O.C. PROJECT; REAL ESTATE: PARTNERS KATHRYN 
THOMPSON AND FREEMAN, SPOGLI PLAN TO CONSTRUCT 1,200 LOW-COST HOMES. 
</P>

 In one of Southern California's largest development deals in recent years, 
home builder Kathryn Thompson has teamed with a major private investment 
banking firm in a four-year, $200-million project to build 1,200 low-cost homes 
in this planned community. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership has purchased 162 acres in Aliso Viejo -- one analyst 
estimated the price at between $35 million and $45 million -- and plans to 
build nine separate developments with most homes priced from $110,000 to 
$185,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Participation of Los Angeles-based investment banker Freeman, Spogli & Co. as 
Thompson's moneyed partner sends a message to the financial world that there 
is, indeed, life in Southern California's recession-plagued real estate 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Mission Viejo Co., developer of the 6,600-acre Aliso 
Viejo community, said the sale is "the biggest residential land sale we've had 
in six years." 
</P>
<P>
 It also is the largest residential land sale anywhere in Orange County, in 
acreage, since the real estate market collapse began in 1989, said Nima 
Nattagh, analyst for TRW-Redi Property Data in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 The last major deal occurred in February, when Dallas-based Centex Homes 
bought 915 lots from financially ailing William Lyon Co. Several builders who 
had bid on the same land put the value of that deal at $45 million. Only 10 
land sales in Los Angeles County during the past five years have been larger 
than 160 acres, Nattagh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, who estimates that the project will create up to 600 construction 
and development-related jobs in Orange County, said Freeman, Spogli has 
guaranteed an investment of up to $50 million in the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 She said a number of Southern California banks have shown interest in 
providing construction financing. "It's wonderful," Thompson said. "We have 
banks courting us for a change." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, many banks and thrifts have avoided real estate investments. The 
major preoccupation of most Southland developers recently has been to find new 
sources of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson called the joint venture particularly important because it shows that 
there is money available for private builders. "The public companies like 
Kaufman & Broad can go the stock market," she said. "This opens new areas" for 
privately owned companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said she teamed with Freeman, Spogli after several disappointing 
trips to the money markets in New York over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a lot of doors slammed in my face" on the East Coast, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is changing, but slowly. "In the past six months we've seen a definite 
increase of interest from Eastern financial sources in the Southern California 
real estate market," said Dennis Macheski, research director for the Price 
Waterhouse Real Estate Group in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The draw, said Irvine real estate marketing consultant Kenneth Agid, "is that 
there is a huge pent-up demand for entry-level housing" and investors are 
beginning to see it. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Wardlaw, general partner at Freeman, Spogli, said the company has 
invested more than $500 million in 18 business deals since it was founded in 
1983, and now is working out of a third investment fund of $580 million. but it 
had never considered a real estate project until Thompson knocked on the door 
of its West Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, who is co-owner of the Kathryn G. Thompson Co. with former Koll Co. 
executive J. Harold Street, has built more than 10,000 homes and apartments in 
Orange and Los Angeles counties in the past dozen years and, as master 
developer of the 2,000-home Laguna Audubon project, has been the largest home 
builder in Aliso Viejo. Her company is headquartered in that community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had not thought about real estate before, but as we got to know her and 
began to understand the great opportunity she was bringing us, we became very, 
very excited about this," Wardlaw said. "We think the timing is right." 
</P>
<P>
 One sign of industry recovery is the fierce scramble among builders to 
identify and buy up land that is already zoned and even graded and that can be 
built on quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parcels that can be completed within the next two years are getting scarce," 
said Laguna Niguel marketing consultant Timothy Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
 And the price of that land, said Agid, "is being bid up, fast."

TEAMSTERS STRIKE SHUTS DOWN TRUCKING FIRMS; LABOR: 22 LARGE COMPANIES CLOSE. 
OTHER BUSINESSES COULD BE VULNERABLE TO SHORTAGES IF THE WALKOUT LASTS A WEEK 
OR MORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the first nationwide trucking strike in 15 years, the Teamsters shut down 
22 large trucking companies Wednesday, forcing customers to scramble for 
available carriers and raising fears of serious disruptions to commerce if the 
walkout continues. 
</P>
<P>
 With no new labor negotiations scheduled, about 75,000 Teamsters across the 
country walked picket lines outside truck terminals in one of the largest 
strikes since the mid-1980s. There were only a few reports of scattered, minor 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial impact was minimal for businesses, but many factories and retail 
stores -- many of which have adopted a policy of keeping lean inventories in 
recent years -- could be vulnerable to shortages if the strike lasts a week or 
more, transportation observers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get into Week 2, inventories start to get drawn down and things start 
to get serious," said Douglas Rockel, a trucking industry analyst at Merrill 
Lynch Research. "After two weeks' time, we could start to see shortages and 
prices might be increased." 
</P>
<P>
 The 22 firms paralyzed by the strike move about 18% of the nation's total 
freight. However, they transport about half of all mid-size shipments over long 
distances. Nearly every Fortune 500 company and countless smaller firms rely on 
the companies to deliver everything from auto parts to computers, clothing and 
home appliances.  
</P>
<P>
 But the firms move little in the way of food shipments, which are transported 
primarily by non-union companies or store-owned fleets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not making any pickups in the country today," said Kathy Finlen, a 
spokeswoman for Overland Park, Kan.-based Yellow Freight System, the largest of 
nation's so-called less-than-truckload carriers, which move shipments primarily 
of 10,000 pounds or less. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the story was much the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're on strike here," said Mike Marcourt, office manager of Yellow 
Freight's Orange terminal. "We're shut down." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street, striking Teamsters gathered at another local truck terminal, 
toting picket signs that urged support for the job action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our solidarity with the national Teamsters is strong. No matter what, we back 
each other up," said Raymond R. Robberson, a driver for Consolidated 
Freightways, a trucking company based in Menlo Park, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Robberson was among 25 drivers who picketed in front of the company's terminal 
on Batavia Road in Orange. The drivers vowed to stick with the strike until 
union officials call it off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be here as long as it takes, 24 hours, day and night," Robberson said. 
</P>
<P>
 As several motorists passing the strikers honked their horns in solidarity, 
Robberson predicted the walkout would have a crippling effect throughout the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything you see, everything in your house comes by truck," said Robberson, 
who is with Teamsters Local 952 in Orange County. "Everyone will feel this 
sooner or later." 
</P>
<P>
 CF Motor Freight of Menlo Park, Calif., said its 500 truck terminals 
nationwide were closed after its nearly 19,000 Teamster workers walked off 
their jobs. But a non-union sister company, Con-Way Transportation Services, 
remained open, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the majority of the nation's trucking companies, which are not 
covered by the Teamster contract, and independent truckers remained open 
Wednesday and reported a stream of new customers seeking available space.  
</P>
<P>
 Roy Ecclefield, operations manager for California Transportation Service in 
Laguna Niguel, hoped the potentially devastating strike would mean a financial 
windfall for his firm. California Transportation Service uses non-union drivers 
to ship everything from canned food to machine parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ecclefield said on Wednesday morning that he received an unexpected shipping 
order from a company frantic to get its products on the road. He expected 
similar orders in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to call us," he said. "If everyone else is down, they got 
nowhere else to go. I'm sure business will pick up." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other companies eager to forestall any shipping slowdown, Ingram Micro 
Inc., one of the world's largest distributors of microcomputer products, 
anticipated the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 A company spokeswoman said that warehouse managers began calling non-union 
trucking companies to take up the slack created by the strike. The company 
normally uses both union and non-union drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana-based company, consequently, had experienced no problems on 
Wednesday and did not anticipate any if the strike continues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to ensure no disruption in our service and there has not been," the 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other non-union trucking companies were also feeling the effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are getting a tremendous influx of additional freight volume," said Jeff 
Jordan, a spokesman for Overnite Transportation, a large non-union trucking 
company with headquarters in Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan said the company will put workers on overtime and run its trucks to 
handle the additional orders, but some shipments may have to wait. "We are at 
or near capacity in most places." 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, competing firms can handle only a small portion of the freight 
handled by the 22 firms. United Parcel Service, for example, is prepared to 
handle more business but can move shipments of only 150 pounds or less, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks broke off last week between the International Brotherhood of Teamsters 
and Trucking Management Inc., which represents the trucking firms in labor 
negotiations, after the union rejected what the companies described as their 
last offer. The Teamsters said company proposals to allow greater use of 
part-time workers and railroads would eventually lead to lower starting pay and 
job losses.  
</P>
<P>
 The unionized companies, which face stiff competition from fast-growing 
non-union firms with lower costs, say the proposals are necessary to ensure 
their long-term survival. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Trucking Management agreed to let many of its smaller members 
sign interim agreements with the Teamsters to allow them to continue operating 
during the strike. Those firms, which operate primarily on the East Coast and 
employ about 10,000 Teamsters, would adopt the terms of a contract when one is 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, which is home to an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 union 
members affected by the strike, Teamster picket lines formed outside about 100 
terminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Sympathetic drivers honked their truck and car horns as they passed about 25 
strikers peacefully walking a picket line in front of the Yellow Freight System 
and CF terminals on East Washington Boulevard in Los Angeles early Wednesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Management proposals to hire more part-time workers seemed to be the strongest 
factor prompting the Teamsters to picket. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just want to increase their profits and turn this into a part-time 
industry," said Zack Lopez, a local driver for Yellow who has been hauling 
freight for the company for 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pacoima, Teamster Kelly Price worried about the strike's impact on his 
family. Price and his wife, Annette, are expecting their third child. He said a 
long strike would hurt his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have to dip into our savings, but that would last for about two 
months," said Price, who was picketing in front of Roadway Express Inc. "But I 
will not cross the picket line." 
</P>
<P>
 The first day of the strike found many companies shifting to other carriers to 
avoid disruptions.  
</P>
<P>
 "The potential for a negative impact on inventory increases the longer the 
strike lasts," said Laura Melillo, spokeswoman for R. H. Macy & Co., operator 
of the Bullock's and I. Magnin chains.  
</P>
<P>
 Macy, like many other retailers, has a lean inventory system, which gives 
store operators the flexibility to quickly change product mix. However, 
anticipating a possible strike, Macy ordered and received much of its spring 
line of clothing earlier than usual, Melillo said.  
</P>
<P>
 Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, was also prepared for the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company had selected alternative carriers as backups for the small 
percentage of our carriers who are Teamsters," said Jane Arend, a Wal-Mart 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Operations at the nation's Big Three auto manufacturers, while not immediately 
affected by the walkout, could be disrupted if the strike lasts beyond this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons: Auto makers increasingly depend on outside suppliers for parts 
and components; they are using just-in-time inventory controls that reduce 
manufacturing costs but leave plants with few spare parts, and high demand for 
cars and trucks has plants operating at capacity, using parts on hand quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler Corp. could be the most vulnerable to a prolonged Teamster walkout 
because it relies on outside suppliers for 70% of its parts. Its factories are 
running full tilt to meet the record demand for its vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking at some alternatives to deal with a strike of short duration," 
Chrysler spokesman Lee Sechler said. 
</P>
<P>
 A trucking strike in 1979, when the Teamsters were far more powerful, ended up 
crippling the auto industry with a walkout-turned-lockout that lasted 10 days. 
The cutoff in freight service prompted General Motors to lay off 12,400 
workers. The Chrysler Corp. shut down almost completely, closing nine of its 10 
North American auto assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
 The 300,000 truck drivers and warehouse workers affected by that dispute went 
back to work after a settlement was reached providing 30% increases in wages 
and benefits over three years.

HEALTH NET SETTLES LAWSUIT OVER DENIAL OF CANCER TREATMENT; MEDICINE: THE HMO 
AGREES TO PAY LESS THAN THE $89 MILLION A JURY AWARDED TO THE FAMILY OF 
PATIENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Health Net, the state's second-largest health maintenance organization, said 
Wednesday it agreed to settle a case in which a Riverside County jury ordered 
the HMO to pay $89 million for denying a costly, experimental treatment to a 
woman with breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides agreed not to disclose the financial terms of the settlement, which 
does not include an agreement by Woodland Hills-based Health Net to change its 
policy of denying payment for procedures that it considers experimental or 
investigational. And the financial settlement may be considerably less than the 
jury award. Without stating a specific figure, Health Net, a unit of 
$2-billion-a-year company, said reserves set aside for the lawsuit are 
sufficient to cover its settlement costs. Analysts put the reserves at $5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 While the settlement ends this case, which drew nationwide attention because 
of the extraordinary amount of the jury award, scores of similar lawsuits 
against Health Net and other health plans are pending over the same issue. The 
Riverside County jury award was the largest ever levied against an insurer for 
refusing to provide health coverage benefits, and it underscored the growing 
conflict over medical cost containment, particularly as more people join 
cost-conscious managed-care plans like HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riverside lawsuit was brought by the late Nelene Fox, who asked Health Net 
to pay for a bone marrow transplant to treat her breast cancer. She obtained 
the treatment with $212,000 in donated funds after Health Net refused. Fox died 
at age 40 last April, eight months after she underwent the treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Jim Fox, pursued the lawsuit on her behalf, and last December a 
Riverside jury awarded the Fox family $77 million in punitive damages and $12 
million in compensatory damages. In the trial, Fox's attorney argued that 
Health Net refused to pay for the procedure to save money and that the delay 
lessened Fox's chance of survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Hiepler, the Fox family lawyer, said the settlement was made because "we 
didn't want it to be tied up in appellate court for several years." Hiepler 
said that since the jury's verdict last December, other insurers that initially 
refused to pay for bone marrow transplants for about 65 women whom Hiepler 
represented have changed their minds. "The legacy of Nelene Fox is that the 
jury spoke and because of this case many people are being helped." 
</P>
<P>
 Health Net had filed a motion for a new trial in the Fox case, but the company 
said the Riverside judge in the case strongly urged the two sides to settle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The folks at Health Net feel it's a fair settlement for all parties, and we 
are pleased that this case has been put behind us," said Health Net spokesman 
Don Prial. 
</P>
<P>
 Health Net officials declined to say how many other lawsuits are pending over 
the same issue of denial of treatment. But Hiepler said he currently 
represented two other women who have health insurance through Health Net, 
including one in Riverside, who sought but were denied bone marrow transplants. 
</P>
<P>
 While health insurers have denied other experimental procedures, no procedure 
has stirred as much debate or lawsuits as bone marrow transplants for breast 
cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Such transplants can cost about $150,000, and the procedure carries high risk 
to the patient because it involves the drainage of bone marrow followed by 
massive chemotherapy. Some doctors say that the transplants offer as much as a 
20% chance of survival, but 5% or more of the patients die from the treatment 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Greaves, Health Net's president, defended the company's decision in the 
Fox case. In a memo to employees Wednesday, Greaves said, "We maintained, and 
still do, that the procedure in question would have potentially done more harm 
than good to the patient."

GUILDS SEEK BACK RESIDUALS FROM GLADDEN; HOLLYWOOD: FILING FOR INVOLUNTARY 
BANKRUPTCY IS MADE AGAINST BEGELMAN'S FILM PRODUCTION COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES and LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood's three major talent guilds on Wednesday petitioned the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles to liquidate Gladden Entertainment -- the film 
production company of onetime studio chief David Begelman and sports mogul 
Bruce McNall -- for allegedly failing to pay $4.1 million in residuals to 
actors, directors and writers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chapter 7 involuntary bankruptcy filing means a return to the spotlight 
for Gladden President Begelman, who was ousted as Columbia Pictures president 
in the late 1970s. In what arguably remains Hollywood's biggest business 
scandal, Begelman pleaded no contest to grand theft charges stemming from the 
forgery of $40,000 in checks. He later headed Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and United 
Artists. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also another setback for McNall, who has been sued by two banks over 
alleged loan defaults. As previously reported, McNall is trying to sell 65% of 
his Los Angeles Kings hockey team in a move largely designed to reduce his bank 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall reduced his stake in Gladden from 50% to 10% in 1988. Begelman now owns 
50%, with the rest held by foreign investors. A spokesman on Wednesday said 
McNall has not been actively involved with Gladden for several years, saying, 
"Neither Mr. McNall nor any of his entities have any liability with regard to 
this matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Calls to Gladden were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Guild sources said Gladden has failed to file quarterly residuals reports for 
more than a year, and scrapped arbitration proceedings scheduled for March 28. 
In correspondence, Gladden executives have disputed the amount owed, and said 
that the guilds should be dealing with the French-owned bank Credit Lyonnais 
because the bank "has a lien on all of the assets of Gladden." Sources familiar 
with the company say Gladden owes the bank $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint move by the Screen Actors Guild, the Writers Guild of America and 
the Directors Guild of America is an unusually harsh action to enforce rules 
requiring producers to pay residuals. The guilds said that its audits showed 
Gladden owes $2.5 million to actors and owes more than $1.6 million to writers 
and directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1984, Gladden produced such films as "The Fabulous Baker Boys," 
"Weekend at Bernie's" and "Mannequin." But the company hit a cold spell in the 
1990s with such films a "Short Time" and 1991's "Mannequin II: On the Move," 
the last Gladden film released. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Cannes Film Festival last year, Begelman announced that Gladden would 
return with a 10-film, $150-million distribution deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 
Live Entertainment and Rank Film Distributors. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century Fox, the Hollywood studio, has attached McNall's assets because 
he personally guaranteed nearly $5 million in advances Fox claims Gladden owes 
because of the dismal performance "Mannequin II." Recent court documents in 
that case show that the lawyers defending Gladden have withdrawn from that case 
because they were not paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, McNall's deal to sell 65% of the Kings to Jeffrey P. Sudikoff of 
Culver City-based IDB Communications Inc. and associate Joseph Cohen is 
expected to close within a week, according to Sudikoff. Details involving the 
$60-million transaction are being finalized. One of the remaining steps is an 
interview with NHL Commissioner Gary B. Bettman, who is in Los Angeles this 
week.

STUDY SAYS CALIFORNIA HMOS SPEND UP TO 31% ON OVERHEAD; HEALTH CARE: INDUSTRY 
OFFICIALS DENOUNCE THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION REPORT, FAULTING ITS METHODOLOGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As private industry and government push more Californians into health 
maintenance organizations to curtail medical costs, a new study released 
Wednesday suggests that HMOs themselves can be big money-wasters. 
</P>
<P>
 The study by the California Medical Assn. found that health plans differ 
sharply in the portion of their revenue -- largely insurance premium dollars -- 
that they devote to providing medical care. Among the state's HMOs, non-medical 
expenditures -- money spent on advertising, taxes, executive compensation and 
other corporate overhead costs -- ranged from 4 cents of each dollar to 31 
cents per dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that necessary medical care has suffered as a result of the 
percentage of premium dollars being spent outside the medical field," said 
Steven Thompson, a vice president of the physicians' group. 
</P>
<P>
 But HMO industry officials quickly denounced the study, faulting its 
methodology and calling it a self-serving effort by the CMA to protect doctors' 
interests. The CMA released the report as it tries to build support for health 
reform legislation pending in Sacramento, including one bill that would limit 
health plan administrative costs to 15% of the premium collected. 
</P>
<P>
 Myra C. Snyder, executive director of the California Assn. of HMOs, dismissed 
the CMA study as a public relations ploy. "What I think they're doing is trying 
to end-run the marketplace," she said. "If you can't compete in the market then 
you try to legislate your view." 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians have complained about losing clout -- and shrinking incomes -- as 
more consumers enroll in managed health insurance plans. HMO enrollment in 
California has grown from 8.8 million in 1989 to nearly 11 million today -- or 
about 35% of the state's population. 
</P>
<P>
 The CMA study focused on a widely followed financial yardstick in the health 
care industry known as "medical loss ratios." Simply put, the statistic deals 
with the portion of insurers' revenue that goes toward patient care as compared 
to various administrative costs. The medical group said it based its data on 
publicly available financial reports by the HMOs for the fiscal year 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the study, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, California's largest 
health plan with 4.5 million members, spent only 4.7% of its revenue on 
administrative costs. At the other extreme, Wellpoint Health Networks, a Blue 
Cross of California subsidiary with 2.8 million members, spent 30.9% of its 
revenue on administration. 
</P>
<P>
 D. Mark Weinberg, executive vice president of Wellpoint, said the use of 
medical loss ratios was a misleading way of measuring how well a health plan is 
serving consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The No. 1 goal of managed care companies is to negotiate lower rates" with 
doctors, hospitals and other providers, Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugh Jones, regional manager for Kaiser's Southern California region, said 
medical-loss comparisons between Kaiser and other health plans aren't always 
fair. Because of its huge membership, Kaiser enjoys certain economies of scale 
that smaller health plans don't have. For example, Kaiser can spread certain 
costs, like the purchase of new medical equipment, over a larger patient 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Melnick, a health care consultant at Rand, agreed that the best measure 
of HMOs' effectiveness is their success at lowering per-capita costs for 
employers and other health-care buyers. "And costs in California are coming 
down compared to the rest of the country." 
</P>
<P>
 He also faulted the CMA's methodology of using data from a single year to draw 
conclusions about the HMO industry. "You can't look at one point in time and 
say, 'Aha, the system isn't working.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, at a time of rapid changes in health care delivery, the study is 
likely to provide fodder for those who question the wisdom of the rush into 
managed care, especially with the growing influence of large, for-profit 
medical companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "My great fear is that these corporations, because of their power, will cut 
delivery of care to patients -- even necessary care -- in order to skim off 
profits," said Dr. Thomas A. Raffin, co-director of Stanford University's 
Center for Biomedical Ethics. Medical Expenses 
</P>
<P>
 California health maintenance organizations vary widely in the percentage of 
their premiums that is spent providing medical services vs. other costs.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: WHY MULTIMEDIA? TUNE IN A FUTURE BILL FOR

 As far as the telecommunications industry is concerned, Federal Communications 
Commission Chairman Reed Hundt and U.S. District Judge Harold Greene are the 
Bobbsey Twins from Regulatory Hell. Between the postponement of the $12-billion 
AT&T-McCaw Cellular deal, the collapse of the $4.9-billion Southwestern 
Bell-Cox Communications venture and the failure of the $32-billion Bell 
Atlantic-TCI acquisition, more than $50 billion worth of multimedia mergers 
have gone on the regulatory rocks this year alone. 
</P>
<P>
 But what's the real bottom line here? Does this mean the end of convergence 
for cable TV and the Baby Bells? A fundamental reassessment of Vice President 
Al Gore's cherished "information superhighway"? An invitation to bold new 
telecommunications legislation? Or, are people simply trying to figure out how 
they're going to make money before they invest billions to buy a cable company 
or an on-line service? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most valuable way to explore the New Economics of Interactive 
Media isn't to speculate wildly about digital technology or evaluate all the 
multimedia players, but to look at the price tag. When all these companies and 
technologies finally hit the marketplace, what kind of bills will consumers be 
getting in the mail (or on their TV screens)? It's the Willie Sutton Principle 
of Futurism: Go where the the money is.

 FDA Unit Finds Calgene Tomato Is Safe to Eat: At a three-day hearing in 
Washington to review the Food and Drug Administration's policies on 
bioengineered foods, the agency's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition 
called the Davis, Calif., biotechnology company's tomato "as safe as other 
currently consumed tomatoes." Calgene is still awaiting formal FDA approval to 
market the gene-altered tomato. The agency may introduce regulations requiring 
that it be notified by food companies intending to sell such products.

four-year, $300-million project to build 1,200 low-cost homes in Aliso Viejo, a 
planned community in south Orange County. The partnership has purchased 162 
acres in Aliso Viejo and plans to build nine separate developments with most 
homes priced from $110,000 to $185,000. Thompson, who estimated that the 
project will create up to 600 new construction and development-related jobs in 
Orange County, said Los Angeles-based Freeman, Spogli has guaranteed an equity 
investment of up to $50 million in the partnership.

DOW EDGES UP 4.32 AS BOND YIELDS STEADY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks bounced around with the bond market on Wednesday, ending mostly higher 
but failing to strongly follow through on Tuesday's big rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrial average, which rocketed 82.06 points on Tuesday, added 4.32 
points to 3,679.73 on Wednesday as winners topped losers by 13 to 10 on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Standard & Poor's 500 index eased 0.24 point to 448.05, and the Nasdaq 
composite index of mostly smaller stocks slipped 0.23 point to 750.72. Trading 
volume declined markedly. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in nearly two weeks, the market did not take an emotional 
roller coaster ride, and interest rates appeared to stabilize. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term bond yields closed mostly unchanged. The yield on 30-year Treasury 
bonds finished ast 7.24%, same as Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some bond traders were encouraged that short-term interest rates continued to 
pull back, suggesting that the market doesn't see the Federal Reserve Board 
hiking rates again soon. The yield on 3-month Treasury bills fell to 3.64% from 
3.74% on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, analysts remain cautious about stocks and bonds, after the stunning 
selloffs of the past two weeks. Though bond yields finally fell back on 
Tuesday, allowing stocks to rebound, many traders doubt that investors will 
quickly pour back into the markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're digesting Tuesday's bounce and trying to figure out which way to go," 
said Michael Metz, investment strategist at brokerage Oppenheimer & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "A certain number of bargain hunters have come into the market," said Ricky 
Harrington, analyst at brokerage Interstate-Johnson Lane said. But "we're in an 
ongoing downward trend" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors continue to be worried about the prospect for higher interest rates 
if the economy strengthens further. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Many heavy industry stocks advanced strongly for a second day, as 
bargain-hunters sought out issues that should gain from a healthier economy. 
Caterpillar jumped 3 3/4 to 120, Deere added 3/4 to 87 1/8, GM gained 1 1/2 to 
58 3/4, Monsanto was up 2 to 80, Cooper Industries leaped 1 3/8 to 38 5/8 and 
Timken rose 3/4 to 34 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some tech issues also gained. Cirrus Logic advanced 1 7/8 to 36 1/4, Sybase 
added 2 to 49 1/4, Motorola rose 1 3/4 to 106 3/8 and Computer Associates was 
up 1 to 33. 
</P>
<P>
 But AST Research plunged 2 1/8 to 19 1/2. The personal computer firm denied 
rumors that it may have to restate prior quarters' earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some retail issues continued their Tuesday rally. J. C. Penney rose 3/4 to 
57 1/4, Ann Taylor surged 1 5/8 to 35 3/4 and Dayton Hudson added 7/8 to 77 
1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, cable TV stocks plunged after Southwestern Bell and Cox 
Cable ended plans to form a joint venture. Cablevision Systems dove 3 3/8 to 
46, Tele-Communications Inc. lost 15/16 to 19 15/16, and Time Warner dropped 1 
1/8 to 38. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, McCaw Cellular fell 1 3/4 to 48 after a federal judge said the 
company's merger with AT&T would violate the consent decree that broke up the 
Bell System a decade ago. AT&T sank 3/4 to 51 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gaming stocks tumbled after voters in Missouri defeated a constitutional 
amendment that would have allowed the use of slot machines in that state. 
President Riverboat plummeted 5 3/8 to 12 1/2, Station Casino lost 3 13/16 to 
14 3/4, Promus sank 3 1/4 to 37 5/8 and Argosy Gaming sank 4 1/4 to 19 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, foreign markets closed generally higher. Tokyo's Nikkei average rose 
133.53 points to 19,696.74, Frankfurt's DAX index soared 32.91 points to 
2,191.20 and London's FTSE-100 index was up 15.3 points to 3,131.5. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller Asian markets were helped by Wall Street's Tuesday rebound. Hong 
Kong's Hang Seng surged 204.40 points to 9,234.31, and Singapore's Straits 
Times index rocketed 54.08 points to 2,115.57. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index rose 26.37 points to 2,260.52. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets, the dollar finished slightly higher against most foreign 
currencies. Gold added 50 cents to $384.90 an ounce on the New York Comex while 
silver fell 4.4 cents to $5.50.

 PUC OKs AT&T's Purchase of McCaw: The California Public Utilities Commission 
approved AT&T's proposed $12.6-billion purchase of McCaw Cellular 
Communications Inc., ruling that the merger is in the public interest and would 
not adversely affect competition. The decision followed by a day U.S. District 
Judge Harold H. Greene's ruling in Washington that the merger would violate the 
landmark consent decree that broke up the phone monopoly a decade ago.Greene 
left open the possibility that AT&T could seek a waiver that would allow the 
deal to go through. The state PUC was the last of nine utilities commissions to 
issue its approval. To satisfy the complaints of several consumer groups and 
companies, AT&T agreed, among other things, to provide McCaw's cellular 
customers with equal access to other long-distance carriers.

EMPLOYERS BEGIN TO RELY LESS ON DRUG TESTS; LABOR: FEAR OF LAWSUITS DISCOURAGES 
TESTING, ALTHOUGH THE TREND MAY GO THE OTHER WAY IN CALIFORNIA. FIRMS ARE MORE 
CAREFUL ABOUT WHEN TO TEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Corporate America's love affair with employee drug-testing may be cooling. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey released Wednesday by the American Management Assn. provides evidence 
that many employers are scaling back their drug-testing programs, even though 
the number of firms that test at least some workers continues to rise slowly. 
Experts attributed the second thoughts about these programs to employer 
concerns about privacy and wrongful termination lawsuits. Costs are a growing 
factor, too, especially since so few workers actually test positive for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The nationwide study, based on a January poll of 794 big and medium-size 
companies, found that 87.2% of the employers conduct drug tests, up from 84.8% 
a year ago. The percentage of companies using such tests had soared in the late 
1980s and early 1990s, largely because of new governmental security and safety 
requirements in industries such as transportation and defense. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year's survey found that, in many cases, fewer workers are being 
tested. For instance, companies that test employees on a random or periodic 
basis said they checked 34% of their eligible staffers in 1993, down from 41% 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The study also detected a decline in firms that test new hires for drug use, 
although the drop-off may be too tiny to be statistically meaningful. The only 
type of testing that appears to have increased is testing for workers involved 
in accidents or for whom there is "reasonable suspicion" of drug use. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings suggest that "a lot of companies are taking a second look at what 
they're doing," said Eric Greenberg, research director of the American 
Management Assn., a nonprofit group offering training programs for nearly 8,000 
corporate members. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, however, a January state Supreme Court court decision might 
prompt employers to buck the national trend and start using drug tests more 
freely, said Los Angeles management lawyer Joel P. Kelly. The ruling, in a case 
brought against the National Collegiate Athletic Assn., makes it more difficult 
to sue employers or other organizations requiring drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly explained that companies in California previously had been more 
reluctant than firms elsewhere to test employees for drugs because of questions 
about workers' privacy rights under state law. 
</P>
<P>
 All the same, employers across the country may be questioning whether testing 
programs are worth the effort and cost. For one thing, an average of only 4.3% 
of job applicants test positive for drugs, according to the American Management 
Assn. survey. For current employees, the figure is 2.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Another emerging issue for employers are costly lawsuits by workers who are 
dismissed, punished or turned down for jobs because of their drug tests. One 
reason that employers are vulnerable to such litigation is that so many firms 
are conducting their drug tests improperly, Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found that at least a quarter of the firms surveyed do not provide 
commonly recommended follow-up procedures when initial drug tests come back 
positive. The problem, Greenberg said, is that the urine tests widely used to 
check initially for drug use often fail to distinguish between legal and 
illegal substances. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone is using an antihistamine, it's going to be read as an 
amphetamine," Greenberg said. Employee Drug Testing 
</P>
<P>
 According to a new survey of 794 big and medium-size companies by the American 
Management Assn., the percentage of employers that test employees or job 
applicants for drugs varies significantly from industry to industry. One 
reason: in industries such as transportation and defense, government safety and 
security requirements often mandate testing. Manufacturing may show the highest 
rate of testing partly because it employs drivers who are required to take drug 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
 INDUSTRY & PERCENT OF EMPLOYERS WHO TEST EMPLOYEES FOR DRUG USE Manufacturing: 
89.8% Public Administration: 88.0% Transportation: 87.5% Wholesale/Retail 
Trade: 82.4% General Services: 79.5% Business/Professional Services: 70.9% 
Financial Services: 64.9% 
</P>
<P>
 TESTING POSITIVE 
</P>
<P>
 When employees test positive for drugs, firms respond in a variety of 
fashions. The figures exceed 100% because some firms listed more than one 
action.

STANDARD BRANDS TO SELL FIRST RECYCLED PAINT PRODUCT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Efforts to keep millions of buckets of old paint out of landfills and 
incinerators will get a big boost today when Standard Brands Paint Co. unveils 
the first recycled paint to be sold through national retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Old paint is already routinely collected in some communities, mixed by 
cooperating paint companies into various shades of gray and used in low-income 
housing projects or to cover graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Torrance-based firm's product for the first time lets ordinary U.S. 
homeowners buy high-quality recycled paint in a wide variety of colors at the 
local do-it-yourself store. And unlike most recycled goods, the paint will sell 
for up to 40% less than comparable paint made from virgin materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're selling it as 10-year paint," said James Moonly, vice president of 
sales and marketing at Major Paint Co., the manufacturing division of Standard 
Brands. "We're very comfortable with that." 
</P>
<P>
 The company already has sold more than 2 million gallons of the paint -- to be 
marketed as "Cycle II" -- to municipalities, state governments and the U.S. 
General Services Administration in recent years. The GSA, as part of the 
Clinton Administration's emphasis on the use of recycled materials by 
government agencies, recently released its first specifications for recycled 
paint, based in part on its experience with the Major product. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paint is the leading edge of the recycling industry now," said Barry N. 
Connell, research associate with the Waste Watch Center, a nonprofit group in 
Andover, Mass. "These companies are now looking at what were formerly waste 
paints as a source of raw materials. But they had to develop a way of sorting 
the different old paints out." 
</P>
<P>
 One big concern is that older paints collected by community hazardous-waste 
efforts could contain lead or other toxics, contaminating the new recycled 
paint mix. Another worry has been how durable recycled paint would be. 
</P>
<P>
 But paint manufacturers are responding to their own needs in developing 
recycled paints. Major pays $600 per 55-gallon drum to send so-called sludge 
paint -- the manufacturing waste from paint-making -- to Southern California 
landfills, Moonly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Major's recycled product is up to 12% old paint, 38% manufacturing waste and 
50% virgin materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Marin County, using a grant from the California Integrated Waste Management 
Board, ran a pilot curbside collection program for used paint. The county then 
worked with Major to develop a marketable recycled paint, giving away 3,600 
gallons of it to residents to get their feedback -- which was favorable.

 SEC Restricts Contributions in Muni Bond Dealings: Stock market regulators 
approved restrictions on the campaign money Wall Street firms can give to local 
government officials.The new rules approved by the SEC are among the strongest 
reforms ever to reach the $1.2-trillion municipal bond market. The rules 
generally prevent muni bond dealers from doing business with local 
jurisdictions for two years after they make a political contribution to a local 
officeholder or candidate. The move comes amid investigations of charges that 
major Wall Street firms may have engaged in political influence-peddling and 
conflicts of interest related to the lucrative muni bond business. The rules 
are expected to go into effect in about a week.

 Neon Cars Recalled for Third Problem: Chrysler Corp. recalled the first 9,000 
of its new subcompact cars to repair a third defect, according to a document 
issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.The agency said 
Chrysler reported a problem involving rear brake hose fasteners on the all-new 
subcompact cars. The auto maker said the hoses could shift and leak, causing 
loss of braking. Chrysler officials who confirmed the recall called the brake 
fastener problem "old news."

 Continental Airlines to Reduce Work Force: The airline said it will cut about 
1,000 jobs by the end of the year as part of a plan to transform itself into a 
low-cost, no-frills carrier.Continental Chief Executive Robert Ferguson will 
announce the company-wide job cuts this week at meetings with employees. The 
layoffs are expected to include about 7% of the airline's managers and 2% of 
its nonmanagement staff, company sources said. Some of the cuts will result 
from Continental's plan announced late Tuesday to end jet service to three 
cities and commuter service to seven other cities in the summer.

 Southwest May Be Dropped From Reservation System: Apollo Information Systems, 
one of the four major computerized airline reservation systems, says it will 
drop Southwest flight information and ticketing capacity from its network on 
May 1 unless the bargain airline agrees to pay for the service. Up to now, 
Apollo and other major reservation systems have included Southwest as a 
courtesy to the 15,000 travel agency locations in the United States and Canada 
that subscribe to the system, even though the low-cost airline declines to pay 
a per-reservation fee, as do other major carriers.A Southwest spokeswoman said 
that paying fees to the systems would cost about $100 million a year. She 
called that a "costly proposition" that could put pressure the carrier's fare 
structure.

COMPUTER FILE / RICHARD O'REILLY: SWEET PRAISE FOR 'SUITE' SOFTWARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Times.

<P>
 Integrated software, which combines several functions such as word processing, 
spreadsheet and database, has never caught on with consumers the way 
stand-alone programs have. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet now that Windows has taken over most of our PCs, the hottest software 
packages these days are the competing "office" and "suite" bundles that 
integrate groups of stand-alone programs. That's some irony, since the 
advantage of Windows is supposed to be that Windows programs from various 
manufacturers can coexist and even integrate with each other merely by virtue 
of being Windows programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But in fact, Microsoft Office 4.2, Lotus SmartSuite 2.1 and Borland Office 2.0 
do have added integration compared to the stand-alone versions of their 
components. More important, however, they provide bargain prices to those who 
really can use most of the programs they contain. 
</P>
<P>
 For large companies, particularly, they make it easier to assure that everyone 
has the same version of a program. 
</P>
<P>
 For single users, however, especially those who actually will only use one or 
two of the programs such as word processing and spreadsheet, it still may be 
cheaper to buy stand-alone versions of those programs and it may well be 
cheaper in the future to buy upgrades for an individual program or two rather 
than for an entire office package. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are a potential office software buyer, there are many factors, often 
conflicting, to consider in making a choice. But the good news is that you 
can't really make a mistake. All three contain top-notch programs that have far 
more functionality than any one person is likely ever to use. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of course if you already use one or more of the products, the choice is pretty 
easy -- unless you happen to use the word processor found in one bundle, the 
spreadsheet in another and the database in a third. In that case, remember that 
database applications with custom forms and reports are the most difficult to 
convert to another program, followed by spreadsheets with fancy macros 
automating them. Word processing files are the easiest to convert. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're just getting started, I think Lotus SmartSuite is the best value 
because it contains the broadest range of programs that are needed to run a 
small business or home office. Just about anyone qualifies for the liberal $299 
"upgrade" price for SmartSuite, which includes AmiPro 3.1 word processing, 
Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows release 4 spreadsheet, Approach 2.1 database, Freelance 
Graphics 2.01 for presentation graphics and the Lotus Organizer personal 
information manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft Office 4.2 has the distinction of bundling the most state-of-the art 
software, including Word for Windows 6.0, the Excel 5.0 spreadsheet, PowerPoint 
4.0 presentations graphics and Microsoft Mail for $299 in a liberally applied 
upgrade policy. For an extra $99, you can add Access 2.0, the 
just-about-to-ship version of Microsoft's in-house designed database. 
Unfortunately the more powerful Microsoft Foxpro for Windows database, which 
grew out of a Microsoft acquisition, is not offered as part of the package. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Microsoft Office packages that actually contain all the software 
should be hitting dealers' shelves about now. Until now you got disks and 
manuals for Word for Windows and Mail and an 800 number to call to get on the 
waiting list for the new versions of Excel and PowerPoint. I got my Excel 
package about six weeks ago and PowerPoint arrived two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanying the programs bundled in Borland Office is something of an 
identify crisis. The program bundles WordPerfect 6.0 for Windows from 
WordPerfect Corp., along with Borland's easy to navigate QuattroPro 5.0 for 
Windows spreadsheet and Paradox for Windows 4.5 database software. 
</P>
<P>
 But Borland is a shrinking company and WordPerfect, the king of DOS word 
processing, has been seriously outsold in the Windows word processing 
marketplace by Microsoft. Now WordPerfect Corp. is being bought by networking 
giant Novell Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Borland Office 2.0, also priced at $299 as an upgrade from virtually 
any single competing program, will continue to be sold. There is sure to be a 
next version, although with a different name, and it is sure to offer strong 
integration with Novell network systems. Whatever its future name, it still 
will contain both Quattro Pro and Paradox. Novell is buying Quattro Pro from 
Borland in conjunction with the WordPerfect deal and it also has a deal to 
bundle Paradox into a million sets of the next version of the Office package. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the most out of the integration offered by any of these packages, you 
need a fast 486-equipped computer with at least 8 megabytes of random access 
memory and hard disk storage of at least 200 megabytes. Figure on 50 to 60 
megabytes of disk space just to install any of these three products. That 
doesn't count DOS and Windows, the extra fonts you'll undoubtedly acquire, and 
fancy screen savers and other special purpose software such as 
telecommunications and fax, which isn't included in any of these three bundles.

TCI LAUNCHING DIGITAL TV TRANSMISSION CENTER; MEDIA: NEW $100-MILLION FACILITY 
WILL ENABLE CABLE OPERATORS TO GREATLY INCREASE THEIR CHANNEL OFFERINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cable TV giant Tele-Communications Inc., moving forward in the wake of its 
failed merger with Bell Atlantic Corp., today will unveil a $100-million 
"digital transmission center" that will make it possible for cable operators 
around the country to greatly expand the number of channels they offer to 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The new technology will allow companies to squeeze in four to eight channels 
where previously they were able to provide only one, paving the way for the 
creation of "niche" networks. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI also is expected to announce that the new technology will help it play a 
bigger role in the emerging direct broadcast satellite market. Cable operators 
like TCI face a threat from Hughes and United States Satellite Broadcasting, 
which are about to launch multichannel systems aimed at siphoning off cable 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 The new transmission center in Colorado will convert a television network's 
signal from analog to digital and then compress it into a "package" with other 
digitized signals. The package of compressed networks will then be transmitted 
by satellite to cable systems around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a 50-channel cable TV system, using TCI's new digitized and 
compressed signals, could offer its customers from 200 to 400 channels. The 
majority of the new channels are expected to be used for pay-per-view movies. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology will eventually let cable TV customers order their channel 
selection "a la carte," choosing only those networks they want to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 But deployment is dependent on a new generation of powerful set-top decoder 
boxes that will likely cost from $200 to $300 each. Delivery of the first 
shipment of decoder boxes to TCI has been delayed because of problems with 
standardization. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the new transmission center puts TCI, already considered the most 
powerful company in the cable industry and a growing force in Hollywood, in a 
position of middleman between the programmers and the cable operators. Some 
critics fear the transmission center could end up acting as a bottleneck for 
programming, with TCI deciding which networks get carried. 
</P>
<P>
 At the outset, the transmission center, which will be capable of compressing 
and transmitting up to 300 channels simultaneously, is expected to serve TCI's 
10 million cable subscribers. TCI also plans to offer the service to medium and 
small cable operators around the country, many of whom cannot afford to upgrade 
their systems for the information superhighway.

LAGUNA HILLS FIRM COMPLETES CHAPTER 7 FOR PUERTO RICO UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 HOH Water Technology Corp., a Laguna Hills maker of water purification 
systems, said Wednesday that it has completed the Chapter 7 bankruptcy 
proceedings for its Puerto Rico subsidiary, HOH International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 HOH International, which operates one of the company's two manufacturing 
facilities, had been mired in financial trouble and sank HOH Water Technology 
in debt. The end of the bankruptcy proceedings clears the way for HOH to remove 
about $3 million in debt. The company will now manufacture its products only at 
its Laguna Hills facility.

 New Campaign: Knott's Berry Farm has come up with a new campaign that pulls 
together its disparate attractions under the line, "The Difference is Real." 
</P>
<P>
 Before this, Knott's often seemed to have an identity problem. But this 
campaign attempts to pull together the image of the Buena Park attraction. 
"History is not under glass at Knott's," the copy reads. "It lives and works 
and talks about America." 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing wrong with the campaign is that it's for the press only. 
According to a company spokeswoman, Dana Hammontree, the theme is for Knott's 
new 1994 press kit, which is produced in-house.

 Millenia Ads: Mazda has begun advertising its new Millenia on television.The 
Millenia is a luxury sedan beginning at $25,999. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine-based Mazda Motor of America said this week that the Millenia and the 
MX-5 Miata contributed to an all-time monthly vehicle sales record in March: 
41,145 cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement puts a positive spin on what has been a sore spot for Mazda 
over the past year: the last-minute cancellation of its plans to produce an 
Amati luxury car division to rival Toyota's Lexus division and the Infiniti 
division of Nissan.

AROUND TOWN / BEVERLY BEYETTE: THE BEAUTY OF THE BEAT; A FREE DRUM WORKSHOP 
AIMS TO TEACH A NEW WAY TO COMMUNICATE AND A BETTER WAY TO LIVE. 
</P>

<P>
 In the shadow of Watts Towers, the Saturday morning children's drum workshop 
is in session. The homework assignment is a kid's dream and a parent's 
nightmare: For practice, "Just beat on a table . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the idea is self-expression. But these students also get a dollop of 
culture and, teacher Stephin Booth hopes, a sense of tradition to boost their 
self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, Booth and Joseph Pilly Martinez have volunteered as a team to 
teach Afro-Cuban drumming at Watts Towers Art Center and other venues around 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 In real life, Booth, 40, is a DWP maintenance and construction worker, and 
28-year-old Martinez is a research development technician for a Riverside 
biomedical firm. But they share a passion for congas and quintos and tumbadoras 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaning over his conga, slapping the cowhide skin with the flat of one hand, 
Martinez counts out the beat: "1-2-3-4. 1-2-3-4. If you can say it, you can 
play it . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Booth places a 3-year-old's hands atop an oak-barreled drum that's almost her 
size. Halfway through the hour-long lesson, her enthusiasm is waning; this 
drum-beating is hard on the palms. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to Stephin Booth, 11, who's here because he wants to be, not because he's 
teacher's son. He already plays stick drums, bass, piano, organ and guitar "and 
I'm learning how to play the flute." 
</P>
<P>
 Young Stephin's dad knows that, for every boy like his son, there are hundreds 
with neither the opportunity nor the guidance to fulfill their potential. These 
are the kids he wants to reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any change in this community's got to start with the individual," says Booth, 
who grew up in Watts. He reasons that if one adult takes the time to teach 
youngsters about their shared heritage "it'll cause them to look at themselves 
and try to find out where they're at." 
</P>
<P>
 He even dares to think, "If guys from different gangs would sit down and play 
together . . . the drum has healing properties. There's definitely a link 
between the drums and the spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 Booth, who plays drums at church, finds that sometimes "music opens the door 
and the words go in." 
</P>
<P>
 He and Martinez go through drum basics with the kids: 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember -- the bass is in the center of the drum." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you grab the skin, the sound won't travel." 
</P>
<P>
 "Use your wrists to save your arms." 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to beat hard and wreck your hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Booth, who's been playing for five years, learned by listening, watching and, 
later, lessons. Martinez, who brings a Caribbean flavor to his drumming, grew 
up in Brooklyn and learned from street musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever I'm angry, I turn to the drums," he says. "If you have a problem 
communicating verbally, you can always express your emotions on the drum." 
</P>
<P>
 That's one message he wants these kids to hear. Another is that, centuries 
ago, the African drum was a form of communication -- one that survived despite 
later efforts by slaveholders in the Caribbean to squelch it and thus avert any 
possible uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 As Booth and Martinez are about to pack up their drums and rattles, a serious, 
bespectacled child, lured by the hypnotic sounds, wanders in off the street and 
starts smacking a drum. He asks what's going on here. 
</P>
<P>
 Booth is not one to miss an opportunity. Free drum classes, he says, "and 
we'll be back here." 
</P>
<P>
 But before the Watts drum workshop returns April 16 from 10-11 a.m., Booth and 
Martinez will offer free drum workshops for all ages from 2:30-3:30 p.m. 
Saturday at the Santa Monica Festival, Clover Park, 2700 Ocean Park Blvd.

 They're the French's New Foreign Legion 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A marathoning French duke was in town recently, going the extra mile, as it 
were -- and as most dukes must -- to raise a few francs for spiffing up his 
ancestral castle. 
</P>
<P>
 Francois, Duc de Liancourt, had timed his Southland visit to the L.A. 
Marathon, but had to pull out with a pulled leg muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35-year-old duke, by day a Paris banker, broke bread with local 
Francophiles at Elin Vanderlip's Villa Narcissa in Portuguese Bend and at the 
California Club with Friends of French Art. 
</P>
<P>
 All agreed that Francois, a handsome six-footer, is charmant . And, while it 
would be unseemly for a duke to come right out and ask for money, Vanderlip had 
no such qualms. Raising funds to restore French treasures, such as the duke's 
10th Century castle, La Rochefoucauld, is her passion. 
</P>
<P>
 Since founding FoFA in 1979, Vanderlip has each year led a well-heeled group 
of devotees to France. For the privilege, each super-tourist gives $6,000 (on 
top of trip costs) for Friends' projects. Raised to date: $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's 10-day Provencal odyssey in mid-May is sold out at 36, reports 
Vanderlip, mentioning that she has six Duponts coming. But it won't be all 
pigeon on toast and vintage wines. Vanderlip expects those on her "house 
parties" to take their mission seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnifying glasses in hand, they'll haunt museums, churches and castles, 
sniffing out deteriorating objets . FoFA efforts have rescued from the 
wreckers' ball a mill painted by Cezanne and Pissarro, salvaged Marie 
Antoinette's harp and part of Empress Josephine's wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent trip Vanderlip learned through Mrs. Hennessy -- "the cognac lady" 
-- about La Rochefoucauld. Unannounced, she dropped in. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, here was a castle in need of help. The digs were less than royal when 
the duke's vivacious mother, Sonia Matossian -- who accompanied the duke and 
his duchess to L.A. -- moved down from Paris six years ago. Even the roof 
leaked. 
</P>
<P>
 The style, after seven centuries of tinkering, is part DaVinci, part Disney. 
It's small, as castles go, only 43 rooms. But Matossian has a staff of only two 
and she's also the tour guide, leading 15,000 paying visitors through annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's much more courageous than me," says the duke, who is an infrequent 
visitor to his 12-acre domain a few hours South of Paris by high-speed train. 
"Ten years ago, it was a ruin. Now we have furniture, we have central heating." 
</P>
<P>
 He first saw the castle when he was five. That day, he recalls, someone gave 
his older sister a rabbit. "I told her, 'give me the rabbit. I'll give you the 
castle.' Unfortunately, she kept the rabbit."

NEW AND USEFUL / LYNN SIMROSS: GREEN IDEAS FOR GARDEN AND LAWN

<P>
 Environmentally correct products and new mechanical devices promise to make 
lawn care a little easier this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the latest yard goods are a natural garlic spray that repels insects; a 
copper tape that gives snails and slugs a little electric buzz to keep them off 
plants and trees; Teflon barrier tape or spray that keeps insects at bay, and a 
nontoxic lure to attract pest-eating ladybugs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the tool department, a new mower attachment lets you fertilize as you mow, 
and a super-powered vacuum/blower picks up everything from aluminum cans to wet 
leaves. Insects, Take This: 
</P>
<P>
 Garlic Barrier Insect Repellent, distributed by Garlic Research Labs, smells 
when first sprayed on plants and trees, but the odor lingers only a few 
minutes. But insects can apparently still smell it -- and don't like it. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick is to spray before infestation, says Bill Anderson of the Los 
Angeles firm. The repellent doesn't kill bugs; it discourages them from 
attacking treated plants. "The garlic spray is absorbed by the plant and when 
whiteflies come by, they will go on to the neighbor's," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Garlic Barrier, available in garden centers nationwide, is made from garlic 
oil and water and biodegrades rapidly. It's harmless to people, pets and ground 
water. Just mix one part repellent to 10 parts water and spray plants, 
including vegetables, fruit trees and vine crops. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, Garlic Barrier can be found at Armstrong's garden stores. A pint is 
$9.95; quart, $16.95. It also comes in large drums for agricultural use. And a 
Jolt of This: 
</P>
<P>
 SureFire Products, manufactured by Consep Inc. in Bend, Ore., is introducing 
three new bug barriers without pesticides. Two consist of adhesive-backed 
tapes, the third is a spray. 
</P>
<P>
 Due out next month is Slug & Snail Copper Barrier Tape, a 15-foot roll of 1 
1/2-inch copper tape that gives off a minor electrical charge. It can be placed 
around trees, plants, planters, patio furniture, raised flowers and garden 
beds. The tape surface should be kept clean with an occasional wiping. 
</P>
<P>
 Already on garden store shelves nationwide are Teflon Insect Barrier Tape and 
Teflon Insect Barrier Spray. Each creates a surface too slippery for insects to 
climb. The two-inch tape comes in a 30-foot roll for use on trees, bird 
feeders, trash cans, doghouses, etc. The spray, in a two-ounce can, may be 
applied to dog or cat food dishes to keep out ants and other crawling insects. 
If either the tape or the sprayed object gets wet, it is ineffective until it 
dries. Fortunately, both seem to dry quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 The suggested retail price for the copper tape, the Teflon tape and the spray 
is $6.99 each. The copper tape will be sold at True Value hardware stores. The 
Teflon products are available at True Value and Ace Hardware outlets and 
selected lawn and garden centers. Calling All Ladybugs: 
</P>
<P>
 SureFire has renamed its Bug Charm lures -- now Ladybug Lures -- but they 
still attract beneficial bugs to the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 According to K. Curt Rymer, director of consumer products for Consep Inc., the 
lures are designed to release a synthesized chemical simulating the scent of 
aphids. Ladybugs and other aphid-eaters pick up the scent from the lure, which 
hangs on a tree branch, and hang out in the area. One lure lasts about two to 
three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladybug Lures, three to a box, cost $6.99 and can be found at lawn and garden 
and hardware stores nationwide. Chow Time: 
</P>
<P>
 Mulching mowers, the kind that return lawn clippings to the turf, have been 
out for several years. Now, Toro has introduced an accessory, the Mow and Feed 
Fertilizer Spreader, that simultaneously mows and fertilizes. 
</P>
<P>
 A plastic hopper mounts on the handlebars of Toro or Lawn-Boy mowers, and the 
rear mower wheels power the spreader. A clutch system automatically stops the 
flow of fertilizer when the mowers stops or backs up. The hopper is lightweight 
(about 10 pounds) and holds enough fertilizer to cover 8,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Mow and Feed, with a suggested retail price of about $50, is available 
nationwide at Toro or Lawn-Boy dealers or at Home Depot stores. A Real 
Blowhard: 
</P>
<P>
 Gator Vac, a vacuum/blower from Weed Eater, is some cleaner. It can pick up 
pine cones, aluminum cans and wet leaves along with grass and hedge clippings. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-pound Gator Vac, with a long green gator-like snout, converts from a 
blower to a vac with the twist of a dial, requiring no tools or additional 
parts. Debris is sucked into a transparent, bottom-mounted collection bag so 
the operator can easily see when it is full. The bag snaps on and off for easy 
emptying. 
</P>
<P>
 The vac/blower has a 1.5-horsepower electric motor and may be used with an 
extension cord up to 100 feet. It also comes with a detachable shoulder 
harness. 
</P>
<P>
 Gator Vac, with a suggested retail price of $89.99, is available nationally at 
all Weed Eater dealers, Wal-Mart, Coast to Coast and True Value hardware 
stores.

INK / PAUL D. COLFORD: DOUBLEDAY HAS FAITH IN 'MESSIAH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, Paul D. Colford is a columnist for Newsday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It doesn't get much better for an author and publisher than when Newsweek 
bases a cover story on their new book and Time gives it generous attention the 
same week. But considering Raymond E. Brown's weighty subject matter and hefty 
list price, it will take more than great publicity to spur impressive sales. It 
will take time and faith, both of which Doubleday professes to have in ample 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's opus is "The Death of the Messiah" -- a two-volume, 1,608-page 
scholarly study of Jesus Christ's Passion as it is related in the four New 
Testament Gospels. Publication of the books, which took Brown 20 years to 
write, provided Holy Week copy for the two news weeklies and newspapers around 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Newsweek praised Brown's "stunning array of fresh insights into how the 
Passion stories came into being and what -- scene by scene -- the four 
Evangelists really say about the arrest and crucifixion of Jesus." 
</P>
<P>
 But a price of $75 for a boxed set likely will deter all but the devout and 
the absolutely curious. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, despite the print attention that "Death of the Messiah" has 
earned, Doubleday's in-print total is downright meager -- 15,000 boxed sets. 
But Thomas Cahill, Doubleday's director of religious publishing, said he 
expects to sell a satisfying 100,000 copies eventually. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I wouldn't want to bet when exactly we'll reach 100,000, but that 
assumption is based on very real figures," Cahill added. Brown, a widely 
respected New Testament scholar, previously wrote a two-volume commentary on 
John's Gospel for Doubleday that has sold 150,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Cahill, no form of scholarship sells as widely as the biblical. 
"There always has been interest in what the Bible is about," he added, "and 
there's a significant audience" -- evenly divided between well-educated readers 
with an interest in Scripture and the Christian clergy, many of whom seek 
inspiration for their sermons. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a Roman Catholic priest who belongs to the Sulpician order, taught for 
many years at Union Theological Seminary in New York City before retiring to 
write at St. Patrick's Seminary in Menlo Park, Calif. After the Time and 
Newsweek stories ran, he reportedly declined invitations to visit the TV talk 
shows of Charlie Rose and other hosts because the dates conflicted with his 
priestly observance of Holy Week. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Brown is unlikely to become a household face, the excitement in 
religious and scholarly circles for his new work is sure to inspire those few 
publishers, such as Harper San Francisco and Doubleday, that produce 
spiritually minded books along with John Grisham thrillers and other commercial 
fare.

 Malcolm's Daughter Plans Memoir: Attallah Shabazz was in the crowd when her 
father, Malcolm X, was assassinated in 1965. Drawing on recollections of that 
day and of the emotional upheaval she and her mother went through afterward, 
Shabazz plans to write a memoir to be published by Bantam Books. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released this week by the publisher, Shabazz said: "I feel 
blessed with the opportunity to use this text as a vehicle to massage the 
heart, stimulate positive self-worth and encourage a better understanding and 
respect for people, our histories, the world around us and our constructive 
place in it."

 Three New Magazines: Garden Design, the first offering from the new Meigher 
Communications in New York, is marketing itself to baby boomers, who the glossy 
bimonthly says are entering their "satisfaction years" and are discovering the 
joys of their own back yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The publishing director is Joe Armstrong, who was publisher of Rolling Stone 
during the 1970s and later ran New York and New West magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 Country Weekly, although published by the same people who turn out the 
dish-digging National Enquirer, offers an unsensationalized, People-like look 
at country-music stars, including cover boy Garth Brooks and Mary-Chapin 
Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
 The premiere issue of Country Travels explores the Mendocino coastline, Deer 
Isle (off Maine), the East Texas of Lady Bird Johnson's childhood and other 
rustic locations befitting a spinoff of the highly successful Country Living 
magazine. Whether Hearst Magazines continues to publish Country Travels will 
depend in part on the response to the 250,000 copies now on the racks.

 B Matter: David Caruso, who plays the red-haired Detective John Kelly in TV's 
"NYPD Blue," has purchased the screen rights to James Dalessandro's "Bohemian 
Heart" with an eye toward starring in a film version of the San Francisco story 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalessandro's first novel, published by St. Martin's Press last summer, 
presents Peekaboo Frankie Fagen, a motorcycle-riding detective who wears his 
hair long, speaks six languages and is called on to investigate a murder based 
on the 1978 slayings of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor 
Harvey Milk. . . .

 The January earthquake has created an even bigger need for the Jimmy Stewart 
Relay Marathon this year. The annual event at Griffith Park raises money for 
the Child Study Center at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, and because of 
quake damage, organizers have set a goal of $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But the day is also a lot of fun for runners and spectators, who join in the 
picnic atmosphere and watch or participate in the Diaper Dash, the Celebrity 
Relay and the big race -- the relay marathon featuring about 1,000 runners -- 
made up of teams sponsored by various groups including entertainment, law 
enforcement, firefighters and seniors citizens. A restaurant division includes 
teams from Spago, Chasen's, Schatzi on Main, Jimmys and more. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the 13th year that actor Jimmy Stewart has hosted the event, and this 
year, the marathon will be dedicated to his wife, Gloria Stewart, who died 
earlier this year. It's the 10th year for co-host Robert Wagner, whose co-star 
on the returning "Hart to Hart," Stefanie Powers, is the honorary course 
marshal. The event, which begins at 8 a.m., is free to spectators. For more 
information, call (310) 829-8968.LAURIE K. SCHENDEN

PASSING THE TASTE TEST; YOUTHS URGED TO MAKE HEALTHFUL CHOICES AT EAT-RIGHT 
FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Daniel Noon, a sixth-grader at MacArthur Fundamental Intermediate School in 
Santa Ana, filled his lunch plate to overflowing Wednesday with lettuce, 
carrots, raisins and strawberries, and complained: "I don't have any more 
room." 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few years ago, school-age kids like Daniel likely would have had 
nothing to do with fruits and vegetables. But he acknowledges that his tastes 
have changed. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of dietary make-over is exactly what state officials and the local 
chapter of the American Cancer Society were promoting Wednesday as they 
presided over a spectacular smorgasbord of fruits and vegetables and invited 
some 200 Santa Ana elementary school children to dig in. 
</P>
<P>
 Held at the Sporting Club at Lakeshore Towers, the rally-like event was part 
of the state's "Children's 5 a Day -- Power Play" program, which is advocating 
that everyone, including children, eat at least five daily servings of fruits 
and vegetables, as specified by federal health guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 And there were plenty of credible role models on hand: Olympic gold medalist 
Florence Griffith-Joyner, Gayle Wilson, wife of California Gov. Pete Wilson, 
and Kimberly Belshe, director of the California Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The eat-right festival had a message that was summarized by Wilson in her talk 
to the children. She told them that eating healthful foods not only reduces the 
incidence of cancer by a third, but it is a "cool" thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents want that same information stressed more frequently in the media, data 
from Belshe shows. A survey of 495 parents conducted last year shows that 93% 
want to require TV commercials to promote good nutrition. Also, 68% would 
restrict the kinds of foods that advertisers would be allowed to push to 
minors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is a recognition by parents that children, like adults, are 
influenced by what they see on television," Belshe said later in an interview. 
"I think the most commonly advertised foods are sweetened cereals and 
beverages, candy and advertisements for fast-food restaurants." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents have good reason to worry about children's eating habits, Belshe said, 
noting that her agency determined last spring that only one in four children in 
California eat the recommended five daily servings of fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't the case on Wednesday, as the 9- to 12-year-olds helped themselves 
to the event's featured 180-foot salad bar, which is expected to be entered 
officially in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's largest. 
</P>
<P>
 To stress the idea that good eating is fun, American Cancer Society volunteers 
dressed as carrots, corn and celery, while a rapper had the children clapping 
as he rhymed, "You need fuel to make your engine go. . . . Don't want to burn 
out 'cause you got to grow." 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, which Belshe said is the first the state has ever taken of 
parents' attitudes toward their children's diet, also showed that 99% want 
nutrition and physical fitness taught in school.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, parents strongly disapprove of having fast foods sold at schools, a 
growing trend in recent years; almost all said they want only healthful foods 
sold on campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Foerster, chief of the nutrition and cancer prevention program for the 
California Department of Health Services, objected that "a number of school 
districts are capitulating" to the efforts of fast-food chains to move into 
school cafeterias. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that variety is a central tenet of good eating, she said that "fast 
food doesn't promote balanced nutrition" because "by definition (it offers) a 
limited menu." She also complained that allowing fast foods to be served in 
identifiable wrappers promotes "commercialism on campus." 
</P>
<P>
 There are some dissenters, among them Daniel Crawford, who runs food services 
at the Capistrano Unified School District, which in 1992 became the first 
school district in the state to establish a fast-food program in its high 
schools. Crawford said he doesn't believe the parents surveyed understand that 
schools negotiate with the fast-food chains to ensure that only nutritious food 
is served in the cafeterias. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't serve the traditional fast-food menu," he said, shunning such 
traditional fast-food fare as deep-fried chicken and potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 The main reason for serving fast foods, Crawford said, is "to try to keep the 
kids on campus so they would not eat junk foods." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Belshe takes a somewhat moderate view of chain foods, saying they need 
not be banned from campus if they adhere to some nutritional guidelines.  
</P>
<P>
 "To the extent they can provide healthy options, it is not necessarily bad," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be unfair to presume all fast-food restaurants are providing 
unhealthy foods, when in fact more and more are responding to the growing 
interest of the public to eat nutritious food." 
</P>
<P>
 Janis Smith, spokeswoman for Irvine-based Taco Bell, which provides food to 
more than 2,500 schools nationwide, observed, "The first step in good nutrition 
is to get kids to eat and not skip meals. Kids love Taco Bell food and 
therefore we find (at schools that have Taco Bell) kids are eating lunch more 
(often) than they would otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Sackin, director of food services for the Anaheim Union High School 
District and Anaheim's elementary schools, agreed that a key issue is to serve 
school kids the food they want. The purpose of Wednesday's lunch was to 
demonstrate that fruit and vegetables "are good to eat and fun and colorful," 
he said. "We are refocusing our energy on training children to make healthy 
choices."

THREE CHICKENPOX-RELATED DEATHS PROMPT AN ALERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three children who had what appeared to be routine cases of chickenpox have 
died within the last two weeks and may have suffered complications from a 
severe bacterial infection, county health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency on Wednesday issued a countywide alert to all area hospitals 
informing them of the deaths, the most recent occurring Tuesday at Samaritan 
Medical Center-San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 There is heightened concern among health officials because, in addition to the 
three who died, at least four other children with chickenpox have been struck 
with similar but non-fatal bacterial infections this year, said Dr. Hildy 
Meyers of the Orange County Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not unusual for us to have one or two deaths due to chickenpox in a 
year," Meyers said. "This is something we are concerned about, but whether we 
are starting an epidemic or not, we can't say." 
</P>
<P>
 The streptococcal infection, which can typically cause illnesses such as strep 
throat and pneumonia, probably entered into the children's bloodstreams through 
lesions caused by the chickenpox infections, the health agency doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These complications are relatively rare and are something you read about in 
medical textbooks," said Meyers. "It doesn't invariably lead to death. In some 
people it just takes a drastic course." 
</P>
<P>
 The identities of the seven children recently struck with the infection were 
not made public by health officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three who died, a streptococcal infection has been confirmed as the 
cause of death only in the case of a 2-year-old Santa Ana girl who died on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The child was brought to the emergency room of Children's Hospital of Orange 
County in Orange with what appeared to be a standard case of chickenpox, said 
Abby Rubenstein, infection control coordinator at CHOC. 
</P>
<P>
 "She seemed fine, except for a bad case of chickenpox," Rubenstein said. "She 
did not suffer from a loss of consciousness, did not have a fever, or seem 
listless." 
</P>
<P>
 Three hours after the child left CHOC, her parents took her to the emergency 
room of Coastal Communities Hospital in Santa Ana, where she died. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 24, Rubenstein said a 5-year-old Orange girl was "near death" when 
she was brought to CHOC. The girl, who died that day, had what appeared to be a 
streptococcal condition, but this was not confirmed by hospital testing. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent death was that of an 18-month-old San Juan Capistrano girl who 
died Tuesday. It is not known if the streptococcal infection was in her blood 
because test results are not yet available. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had chickenpox for four or five days, then developed a fever and became 
unresponsive later," Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Little is known about the four non-fatal cases, except that they involved 
2-year-old twins, a 2-year-old child and a 5-month-old infant. The cases are 
not believed to be related, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers said parents should not be overly alarmed by the recent deaths but she 
urges them to seek medical attention for any child exhibiting symptoms of 
chickenpox if there is a change in the course of the illness, such as 
development of a high fever, nausea, a change in the type of rash, or a change 
in mental acuity or awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 The normal symptoms of chickenpox, which Meyers said afflicts 90% of the 
population before the age of 15, include moderate fever, headache, occasional 
sore throat and a pink, spotted rash that turns to tiny blisters then scabs 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they seem to be getting better but new symptoms develop, then seek medical 
care," Meyers said. "It may be a sign that they are getting a secondary 
infection." 
</P>
<P>
 This severe type of streptococcal infection is on the rise throughout the 
United States among people of all ages and is not always linked to chickenpox. 
It can be inexplicably deadly to some people and not to others, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The infection can be treated with antibiotics but, Meyers said, there is 
little that can be done in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if they seek medical care, the moment there is a sign, you can't always 
save them," she said. "Sometimes, especially with children, infections go so 
quickly and the best medical care in the world isn't going to alter the 
course." Deadly Infection 
</P>
<P>
 A rare streptococcal infection may be the cause of death of three Orange 
County children who had routine cases of chickenpox. The virulent infection can 
enter the bloodstream through chickenpox lesions and has specific symptoms. 
What to look for: 
</P>

LONG-LOST FAMILY FOUND JUST MILES AWAY; REUNION: WESTMINSTER MAN WAS SEPARATED

 Twenty years and three freeways separated them. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulled apart in Saigon, Ronald Yohe wondered where in the world his girlfriend 
and their children were living. They were 30 miles away, he discovered 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final days of 1974, Yohe, then 42, watched the Communists sweep through 
Saigon. Everyone was bailing out and Yohe was next. Ny Pham, his 23-year-old 
girlfriend and mother of his two children, had to find her mother in the Mekong 
Delta. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities told Yohe that if he followed her, he was dead. When he said 
goodby, she wept but refused to look back at him. 
</P>
<P>
 That was 20 years ago, and Yohe, an American aircraft repair contractor, 
continued to hopscotch the globe, landing in Iran and Thailand and even 
Honolulu before living the past two years in a Westminster efficiency apartment 
covered with pictures of military aircraft and pinups of Vietnamese models. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the American Red Cross called to say that Pham and her children 
were living just miles away in Rosemead. Yohe, now 62, who had made numerous 
inquiries through the Red Cross and the Catholic Church to locate his family, 
was given a telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
 It was up to Yohe, the Red Cross said. Did he still want to see them? 
</P>
<P>
 Yohe picked up the phone and dialed. He spoke to Pham and suggested they all 
meet Saturday. No way, she said. The family would be in Westminster in a couple 
of hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like it was yesterday the way we spoke," he said. "They all wanted to 
see me right away." 
</P>
<P>
 And so they did. Hugging and crying and laughing in the parking lot of a 
Westminster apartment complex. Pham, now 43, brought their two children, Bao 
Quoc Pham, 21, and Binh Pham, 19, and Pham's other daughter Candy Phan, 25, 
herself a mother of two. Yohe had a larger group of his relatives there as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been 20 years," the snowy-haired Yohe whispered to Pham. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know," she said. "I remember you." 
</P>
<P>
 Pham pulled a blurry black-and-white photo of the young couple in Vietnam out 
of her handbag. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only keep one picture," she said of the government's restrictive 
policies. "I kept it for 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Binh Pham could not let go of Yohe, tugging at his cheeks and kissing him 
again and again. She practiced saying "daddy" as if it were a foreign word she 
was trying to memorize. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every family had a daddy and I didn't have one," she told her father. "Bao 
and I didn't have a daddy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now you have one," he said softly. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the tiny apartment, the women gathered around Yohe on his bed, flipping 
through faded photographs taken in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Yohe said he had forgotten much of his Vietnamese vocabulary over the years, 
but he and Pham nervously traded recollections of the five years they were 
together. Yohe would point at a photo and Pham would laugh at the woman who 
sold Coca-Cola or the humorous American acquaintance who sat at the dinner 
table with them one night. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get the checks and the letters I send you?" Yohe asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep them all," Pham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yohe had worked for Bell Helicopter, fixing the copters that kept being 
damaged during the war and teaching the South Vietnamese something about 
maintenance. He met Pham in Tuy Hoa, on the coast of the South China Sea, 
through a friend of a friend. Separated from his wife in the United States, 
Yohe began a five-year relationship and she followed him as he traveled 
throughout the country fixing aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, he left her with the television and the refrigerator and the kids 
and a promise that they would meet again someday in the United States. He sent 
her $100 every two weeks and she sent him letters. But within six months, the 
Communists had taken Saigon and all communication was lost. 
</P>
<P>
 While Yohe, now divorced, was still working overseas, his siblings and parents 
did what they could to try to find his Vietnamese family, even contacting Camp 
Pendleton to seek their help. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Yohe contacted the Southeast Asian specialist for the Orange 
County Chapter of the American Red Cross. As it happened, the Phams had placed 
a request earlier in the year through the Red Cross chapter in San Gabriel 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were in the same area of Southern California and neither one of them 
knew it," said Kara Lakkees of the Red Cross. "Now they're together." 
</P>
<P>
 Asthmatic and living on disability, Yohe settled in Westminster two years ago. 
About the same time, the Phams relocated to Rosemead after living in the 
Philippines. Pham got a job as a seamstress. The children are in school. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday night, an hour after being reunited with his family, Yohe's head 
was still spinning, he said. Was he going to move everyone into his apartment? 
Would they all live together? He still hadn't figured it all out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want my dad to live with me and my family," Binh Pham said without 
hesitation. "For 19 years, I never had a dad."

PROSECUTOR: TAY MURDER WELL PLANNED; COURTS: PROSECUTOR IN TRIAL FOR ROBERT 
CHAN CLAIMS TEEN'S ASSAILANTS DUG A SHALLOW GRAVE THE DAY BEFORE AND REHEARSED 
THE BUENA PARK KILLING TO ENSURE IT WOULD GO OFF WITHOUT A HITCH.

<P>
 Determined that the 1992 New Year's Eve slaying of honor student Stuart A. Tay 
would go off without a hitch, his teen-age assailants dug a shallow grave the 
day before, posted a lookout and even ran through a dress rehearsal of the 
killing, a prosecutor told jurors Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 As the murder trial of 19-year-old Robert Chan got underway, the prosecutor 
described him as the mastermind behind two weeks of meticulous planning that 
ended with a young man slain in a Buena Park back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the one," Deputy Dist. Atty. Lewis R. Rosenblum said Wednesday, 
pointing to Chan, who sat quietly at the defense table. "He was the one who 
orchestrated what was to happen to Stuart Tay." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor's comments in one of Orange County's most sensational criminal 
trials were interrupted as court ended for the day. Opening statements are 
scheduled to resume this morning in a case that has come to symbolize juvenile 
crime out of control.  
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution's key witness, an 18-year-old who admitted joining in Tay's 
brutal beating, is expected to testify today. 
</P>
<P>
 The killing stands out because both Chan and Tay, 17, were exceptional 
students from comfortable families who seemingly had golden futures ahead of 
them.  
</P>
<P>
 "Not only was (Tay) then beaten over and over for 20 minutes, but that wasn't 
what killed him," Rosenblum told the jury.  
</P>
<P>
 He said that Tay died of asphyxiation -- choking on his own vomit -- after 
Chan forced rubbing alcohol down his throat and used duct tape to cover his 
nose and mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan was at one point a candidate for valedictorian at Sunny Hills High School 
in Fullerton. His attorney, Marshall M. Schulman, has said his client was 
wrongly tagged as the ringleader and is expected to present the defense's 
opening statement today. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan faces life in prison without parole if convicted of murdering Tay, a 
student at Foothill High School in Santa Ana who had aspirations of becoming a 
physician. 
</P>
<P>
 Three others charged in the case, Abraham Acosta, 17, of Buena Park, and Mun 
Bong Kang and Kirn Young Kim, both 18 and of Fullerton, will go on trial after 
Chan's case concludes. A fifth youth, Charles Bae Choe, 18, and also of 
Fullerton, has since pleaded guilty to his role in the murder and is the 
prosecution's key witness. 
</P>
<P>
 The co-defendants are expected to allege that Chan -- the only adult among 
them -- used fear to organize and sway the teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schulman contended during pretrial motions Wednesday that Chan had feared 
Tay, who allegedly told his assailants that he belonged to a powerful Asian 
gang and was involved in counterfeiting. Chan had also believed that Acosta had 
already killed two other people in acts similar to the assault on Tay, 
involving bats, alcohol and duct tape, Schulman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether the teen-agers were simply bragging to each other, or had crossed 
the line to engage in criminal activity before the murder, remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor told Superior Court Judge Kathleen E. O'Leary that he 
investigated but uncovered no evidence that Acosta had committed other slayings 
or that Tay was a gang member. The prosecutor said Kang had previously been 
arrested on a petty theft charge, and said Chan, Choe and Kim had apparently 
cheated on their SAT tests. 
</P>
<P>
 A search of Kang's home turned up photos of him flashing gang signs, but no 
other evidence to indicate he was a gang member, Rosenblum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan had claimed gang membership and involvement in beating up a teen-ager a 
few months before the slaying, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 During opening statements, Rosenblum told jurors that the teen-agers bragged 
to impress each other, riding a trend that has made gansta rap and gang 
clothing the rage. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Tay had become interested in Chan because the older teen appeared to 
be surrounded by this gang "mystique," possessing the kind of "juice" to get 
things done, the prosecutor said.  
</P>
<P>
 He said most of the youths appeared to be good kids before the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything looked good on the outside, but there was another side," he told 
jurors. "They were not angels." 
</P>
<P>
 Tay met Chan by chance. Tay's girlfriend at the time had met Chan at traffic 
school and set up a meeting between the two young men. But Tay used the alias 
Martin Gore, the name of a musician he liked, and also gave Chan a phony 
address and age, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the tension that existed between them, Tay and Chan plotted to rob an 
Anaheim computer parts dealer by forcing their way into his home and tying up 
his family before making off with the goods. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Chan caught a glimpse of Tay's driver's license and fearing that he 
was an informant, Chan began plotting an "ingenious plan" to kill him, 
Rosenblum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan allegedly lured Tay to Acosta's Buena Park home under the guise of buying 
a handgun. The night before, Chan, Acosta and Kim dug the grave, Rosenblum 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The next afternoon, the young men held a dress rehearsal, going over how the 
ambush would occur and who would wield the bat, Rosenblum said.  
</P>
<P>
 After Tay arrived, he was handed a metal box tightly wrapped with tape -- it 
was supposed to contain the weapon. As he struggled to open it, the blows came, 
Rosenblum said.

FINGERPRINT PROGRAM TO TARGET AID FRAUD; WELFARE: CRITICS SAY THERE ARE ALREADY 
ELABORATE SECURITY MEASURES AND THE THREE-YEAR EXPERIMENT WILL COST MORE THAN 
IT SAVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 State and county officials say that an experimental program to fingerprint 
welfare recipients ensures the virtual elimination of fraud, but questions are 
being raised about whether the program will cost more than it saves. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson last week authorized Los Angeles County to begin 
fingerprinting about 400,000 adult applicants for Aid to Families With 
Dependent Children. County officials estimate a savings of $49 million over the 
life of the three-year pilot project. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics of the plan, including legislative analysts, maintain that the 
savings estimate is based on dubious assumptions and say the state and county 
may spend $20 million to run the high-tech program while rooting out much less 
in fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The concerns about the program come at a time when the state and county are 
anticipating severe budget shortfalls, with expected cuts in social welfare 
services at both levels. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials are counting on the state and federal government to pick up 
much of the tab for the project, but some key legislators say that unless local 
officials present more convincing evidence of the need for the program, the 
money might be better spent elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. County has not provided us with any new information that would change 
the analysis . . . that this is a risky investment," said Sara McCarthy, a 
consultant to state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), who is chairwoman of the 
Senate's Health and Welfare Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The new tracking system is designed to thwart welfare recipients who try to 
collect extra checks by using false identification and Social Security cards to 
file multiple claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Using new fingerprinting technology, prints of the index fingers of aid 
applicants will be scanned electronically. A computer will compare the prints 
to those of people already receiving assistance. Applicants who refuse to 
cooperate will be denied aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County will be the first in the nation to fingerprint aid 
recipients, most of whom are impoverished single-parent families or families in 
which parents are unemployed or disabled. More than 850,000 adults and children 
in the county receive about $2 billion a year in benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors unanimously approved the pilot project, which they 
say will reduce welfare costs by weeding out and deterring fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 They based their optimism on their experience with a similar fingerprinting 
program used in the county General Relief program, which serves mostly single 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say that since fingerprinting of General Relief recipients began in 
June, 1991, they have saved about $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1.2% of General Relief cases are terminated for filing duplicate 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Others who were unwilling to be fingerprinted also were terminated. According 
to a 1992 fingerprinting proposal by the county's Department of Public Social 
Services, 3,000 people were terminated for this reason during the first six 
months of the program. "This translates into aid savings of $5.4 million," 
according to the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics counter that the county has presented no proof that those who were 
unwilling to be fingerprinted represented actual instances of fraud. They say 
that many of the General Relief recipients may simply have been intimidated by 
the fingerprinting plan.  
</P>
<P>
 "We kept asking them why people didn't show up to be fingerprinted and they 
said they didn't look into that aspect of it," said Kim Flores, a senior 
consultant to the Assembly's Ways and Means Committee, which refused to 
appropriate state funds for the welfare fingerprinting project last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the fingerprinting plan also question whether such fraud is rampant 
enough to warrant implementation of the costly detection system. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores said Aid to Families With Dependent Children already has an extensive 
computer-based fraud detection system. Investigators can tap into databases to 
compare information on bank accounts, employment earnings, Social Security 
income, addresses and phone numbers, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials estimate that 1.5% of aid recipients will be caught trying to 
file a second application. Most of the estimated savings are based on the 
assumption that the fingerprinting will deter fraud, which officials concede is 
difficult to calculate. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Genest, the state Department of Social Services' deputy director for 
welfare programs, said the state has contracted with an independent accounting 
firm to make a thorough evaluation of the Los Angeles project to determine how 
many cases are terminated and why. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many analysts remain skeptical and contend that the money could be 
better spent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now the state spends about $72 million for welfare fraud programs, and 
with this program we're increasing that about 13% in one fell swoop, but I 
doubt whether we're going to be doing a 13% better job," said Keith Umemoto, a 
consultant to the state Senate's Budget Committee. "I think ultimately we'd be 
much better off spending that money on something that reduces the AFDC 
population, like . . . collecting child support." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said the fingerprinting system could be in place within a 
month and it will take five to six months to get all current aid recipients 
processed. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has spent about $3 million for installation of equipment, hardware 
and programming, said Lisa Nunez, the county's project director for the 
fingerprinting program. That will cover operation of the project through the 
current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor is seeking an appropriation from the Legislature to fund the 
program in the next fiscal year, and his proposal is scheduled to be taken up 
by Assembly budget committees this month. 
</P>
<P>
 However, state and local officials are so sure of the program's success that 
they say it can be funded through expected savings.

RENO JOINS IN ENDORSING COMMUNITY-BASED POLICE; LAW ENFORCEMENT: ATTORNEY 
GENERAL JOINS LOCAL OFFICIALS IN SAYING IT WILL BUILD BONDS BETWEEN OFFICERS 
AND THE CITIZENS THEY PROTECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno strongly endorsed community-based policing at a Los 
Angeles forum Wednesday, joining local law enforcement officials and others who 
say it will enhance crime prevention and build stronger bonds between citizens 
and police. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is imperative that we build that trust," said Reno, who was warmly 
greeted by a packed audience, mostly students, at Cal State L.A. "You can't 
build that trust if you see somebody driving by in a patrol car and you don't 
know their name and you can't get their badge number." 
</P>
<P>
 Reno's comments reflect the broad support for community-based policing, an 
idea that is widely accepted if only vaguely understood. At Wednesday's 
session, the popular attorney general was joined by a United States senator as 
well as a number of police chiefs, sheriffs, prosecutors, a school principal, a 
minister and others -- and none voiced opposition to community-based policing. 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, it is a philosophy of law enforcement that emphasizes crime 
prevention over emergency response and that measures success more in terms of 
reducing crime than increasing arrests. The Christopher Commission, which 
reviewed the policies and practices of the Los Angeles Police Department in the 
wake of the 1991 beating of Rodney G. King, urged the LAPD to adopt a more 
community-oriented approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Willie L. Williams is an enthusiastic proponent of 
community-based policing and he too was greeted with loud applause during 
Wednesday's session. The LAPD already has incorporated some elements of the 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Community input into LAPD decisions has helped the department set new 
priorities in some neighborhoods, Williams said. For example, officers have 
been encouraged to spend more time establishing safe corridors for children to 
go to and from school, fighting graffiti and otherwise responding to issues 
that do not necessarily involve serious crimes but nevertheless are of great 
concern to residents. 
</P>
<P>
 A crime bill working its way through the Congress would pay for 100,000 new 
police officers across the United States, and Reno said community policing is 
"at the core" of that bill. Reno, who called the crime bill "smart, 
compassionate, wise and tough on the people we need to be tough with," said it 
would bolster community policing efforts nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's session was marked by unanimity among the 22 panelists, who 
arrived from across the state to discuss community policing with Reno. Sen. 
Diane Feinstein (D-Calif); Nora Manella, U.S. attorney for the Central 
District; Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, Los Angeles County 
Sheriff Sherman Block were among those participating in the session. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's only sharp difference of opinion arose over the question of whether 
police officers should live in the communities where they work. That issue was 
broached by an American Civil Liberties Union report last month and since has 
touched off a flurry of angry reaction among police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Levenson, a Loyola law school professor who led the discussion 
Wednesday, prefaced the session by noting that the issue was a "hot potato" and 
asking which of the panelists cared to respond. Williams volunteered and 
rejected the suggestion that officers should be required to live in the areas 
they patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter where you live," said Williams in his strongest comments on 
the issue. "I am far less concerned with where an officer lives than with what 
they do with their eight or nine hours that they're on the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' comments were greeted with a smattering of boos, and later Feinstein 
took issue with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more involvement an officer has with the community after hours, the 
better that policing will be," Feinstein said, adding that she would have 
proposed residency requirements for San Francisco officers had state law 
allowed it. An amendment to the state Constitution prohibits such requirements 
for municipal workers in California.

SOUTH-CENTRAL TUNES ITSELF IN; RESIDENTS OF THE AREA GIVE MIXED REVIEWS TO NEW 
TV SHOW ABOUT FAMILY'S STRUGGLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY and GREG BRAXTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The critics may be lavishing praise on Fox's new television series "South 
Central," but many real-life residents of the area gave the Tuesday night 
premiere mixed reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ambiguous about it," said Bobby Glanton Smith, a consultant for the 
Marcus Garvey School. "It was intriguing enough that I would watch more 
episodes, but it had somewhat troubling stereotypical aspects, particularly the 
son who seemed lazy and had no direction. Hopefully the characters will develop 
in later episodes." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's guarded optimism reflected the doubts shared by other South-Central 
viewers about the portrayal of the fictional Mosley family, headed by a single 
mother struggling with unemployment and parenthood. In contrast to glowing 
notices from newspapers such as the New York Times and USA Today, which raved 
that its attempt to portray reality "succeeds wildly," residents were less than 
enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brotherhood Crusade, which had praised the pilot episode in a letter 
written last year to the producers, withdrew its support Wednesday in a letter 
sent to the show's creators, Ralph Farquhar and Michael Weithorn. The group 
said they were offended by the show's content and wanted it turned into an 
"accurate" reflection of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Bakewell, president of Brotherhood Crusade, said he had not seen the 
show, even though he signed the letter of support sent last year. That letter, 
Bakewell said, had been written by a former employee who "took it upon himself 
to speak on behalf of myself and the Brotherhood Crusade." 
</P>
<P>
 Bakewell said he understood from group members that the show contained "a 
number of age-old stereotypical concepts and phrases" that were "packaged into 
a 1994 version of 'Amos and Andy.' " He said he was opposed to references to 
"nappy hair" and the use of the word bitch. He also said he was offended by a 
punch line used by the teen-age daughter in the series: "Nothing gets me going 
like the smell of gunpowder in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot episode introduced the Mosleys -- mother Joan, daughter Tasha, son 
Andre and foster son Deion -- as a family living on the edge. The mother 
(portrayed by Tina Lifford) has been out of a job for more than a month and is 
desperately seeking work; teen-age Andre (Larenz Tate) is showing signs of 
rebellion by buying a beeper; Tasha (Tasha Scott) is clamoring for a jacket her 
mother cannot afford.  
</P>
<P>
 Some viewers thought the episode rang false, too overburdened with 
sociological problems to allow the characters to let their guards down and 
function simply as a family. Others acknowledged the reality of those problems 
but didn't necessarily think it made good television. A few sided with critics 
and thought "South Central" managed to strike a balance between the good, the 
bad and the mythological. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was put off in the first few minutes of the show, especially when the 
daughter joked about smelling gunpowder every morning," said Dwight Domingue, 
35, a lifelong South-Central resident. "But as it unfolded, I found myself 
getting involved, because I could relate to the situation in the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not everyone in South-Central can relate to a similar experience, and when I 
was growing up it was not like it is now," Domingue said. "But the condition of 
the 'hood has gotten to that point. Unfortunately, the show was realistic, 
right down to the bars on the windows." 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Trice, a single mother of three, said that the show echoed real life 
and may have even underplayed the grittiness a bit. "But I don't feel we need a 
weekly reminder of what's going on in South-Central," said Trice, 37, a 
resident of the Crenshaw district. "It's depressing to see a black family 
talking about food stamps, not having money to buy things. It's a reminder of 
what I go through all the time. Why would I want to see that on TV?" 
</P>
<P>
 Weithorn said that because of the dearth of realistic shows depicting African 
Americans, the series is being unfairly criticized for not being all things to 
all people. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is not really the show, but the fact that any black show that 
comes along has to bear this burden," he said. "The show reflects one reality 
-- a single mother's household -- that does exist. We spent a lot of time with 
people in South-Central and tried to portray situations accurately and 
honestly."  
</P>
<P>
 "We really believe that we did an honest rendering," said co-creator Farquhar. 
"And we don't just dwell on the problems, on the dirty laundry." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tamy Netherly, a 27-year-old single mother and student at Los Angeles 
Trade Tech, agreed with Trice. "I didn't like it," she said. "It was 
depressing, not motivating in any way. I especially didn't like the scene in 
the grocery store, when the mother had to put things back on the shelf because 
she didn't have enough cash. Why couldn't she have gone on and finished USC? 
Why did she have to drop out of school?" 
</P>
<P>
 Netherly also said using words such as bitch and nappy-headed was offensive. 
"People were laughing, but to me there was nothing to laugh at," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trice said the teen-age son was too ill-mannered to be convincing -- 
particularly in using the word bitch in the household -- although her 
14-year-old son Kelvin said Tate, and the show in general, were generally true 
to form. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a lot of guys . . . who talk like that," he said. "I liked it a lot 
better than (the television show) 'Martin' because it seemed more real." 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter to Weithorn and Farquhar, Bakewell said he and other community 
leaders wanted to talk to the creators about changing the show into a program 
"that accurately reflects the community which you have chosen to write about." 
He also said the letter "serves notice that the types of intolerable images 
depicted in your present show will be met with vehement opposition." 
</P>
<P>
 In response to Bakewell's criticism, Weithorn said, "We were always interested 
in hearing input from any relevant individuals or groups, but what we are doing 
could be philosophically irreconcilable with the agenda of various individuals 
and groups. We're not about to fundamentally change what the show is. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're proud of the show," he said. "We've had an overwhelmingly positive 
response. The comments by Danny Bakewell and others do not seem to reflect the 
comments of the general audience of the show." 
</P>
<P>
 Some community members had blasted the show during a screening of the pilot 
last week at 20th Century Fox. Many in the audience said they thought the show 
reflected negatively on the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The national ratings for the premiere scored a 21% increase in total 
households watching during the 8 p.m. time slot for the Fox network. Nationally 
and locally the show outperformed NBC's "Good Life" but lost to "Full House" on 
ABC and "Rescue 911" on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality versus perception made for a lively round-table discussion at the Van 
Ness Avenue home of Gerald and Cassandra Clark, who watched the premiere along 
with their three children and two neighbors. Everything, from the show's vague 
geography to its opening theme song that flashed images of streets that were 
not in South-Central, was dissected.  
</P>
<P>
 "Focusing on the teen-age boy and his problems was in itself wrong and 
misleading," said Cassandra Clark, 40, a community activist who has led the 
fight to limit the number of liquor stores in South-Central. "There was too 
little discipline . . . the mother seemed to have no authority, no foundation 
as a parent. And she out-and-out lied to a potential employer about her 
qualifications so she could get a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Clark was more forgiving. "It gave you something to think about," he 
said. "My overall impression of it was that it was pretty positive. . . . It 
was fairly accurate except for the absence of the male figure in the house. 
Once again you had a black family, but a broken one. And the profanity was not 
acceptable for prime time."

A COYOTE CATCH-22; WILDLIFE: A CITY BAN ON TRAPPING WILL BE RECONSIDERED. BUT 
SOME ANIMAL-CONTROL OFFICIALS SAY CAPTURING AND KILLING DOESN'T HELP MUCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The nocturnal howls that awoke Lana Kuhlen from a dead sleep five months ago 
signaled a change in her Woodland Hills neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Coyotes were beginning to feast on her neighbor's ducks, chickens and cats, 
leaving the carcasses on neighborhood lawns. A determined coyote scaled a 
six-foot-tall fence to eat Kuhlen's own chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 The experiences did more than wake Kuhlen up. They launched her into a 
contentious citywide debate over the merits of wild animal trapping. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a huge problem, it really is," said Kuhlen, who lives in Woodland Hills' 
flatlands, far from the customary rural habitat of the coyote. "I kind of feel 
like we have become the fast-food capital for coyotes out here." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, Kuhlen's complaints have been echoed repeatedly by 
distressed West San Fernando Valley residents, prompting the Los Angeles Board 
of Animal Regulation Commissioners to review its 10-month-old ban on coyote 
trapping. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of that review will be a question that cities throughout Southern 
California have struggled with for years: Can trapping and killing coyotes put 
an end to coyote problems? Or is public education about coexisting with coyotes 
more effective? 
</P>
<P>
 If Los Angeles officials look to other Southern California cities for 
guidance, they will find that most municipalities faced with coyote problems 
use traps on a limited basis, relying primarily on teaching residents the 
mechanics of getting along with Canis latrans.  
</P>
<P>
 Of 27 Southern California cities with large wildlife populations, none 
completely ban coyote trapping. Yet animal control officials from those 
agencies stress that trapping is at best an ineffective, short-term solution. 
</P>
<P>
 By one estimate, trapping is successful only 10% of the time. Often, the traps 
snare more pets than coyotes. Moreover, when a coyote is killed, the remaining 
coyotes in the area tend to fill the void, usually with larger litters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think trapping is effective," said Marsha Wyatt, a state humane 
officer with the Pomona Valley Humane Society. "When you move one adult coyote 
out . . . two juveniles will move in." 
</P>
<P>
 In Pasadena, animal control officials tried coyote trapping on a large scale 
about six years ago but found that only sick or injured coyotes were caught. 
Pasadena and other cities distribute brochures and pamphlets warning residents 
to put pets and pet food indoors at night, to fence yards and to keep garbage 
can lids secure, thus cutting off the coyotes' food supply. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over coyote trapping in Los Angeles was sparked in June, 1993, 
when the Board of Animal Regulation Commissioners voted, at the urging of 
animal-rights advocates, to ban trapping of coyotes by city employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the panel decided to launch an educational program. The city printed 
about 5,000 brochures titled "Co-Existing With the Coyote," and it is producing 
a cable TV program on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 12 months before the trapping ban, residents lodged 511 coyote 
complaints with the city, according to the Animal Regulation Department. During 
the same period, coyotes were blamed for the deaths of 116 cats, 23 dogs and 50 
other pets, mostly in the West San Fernando Valley and West Los Angeles, the 
department said. In that same period, the city trapped and killed 34 coyotes 
citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 But after trapping was stopped, complaints about coyote sightings and attacks 
on pets rose. 
</P>
<P>
 West Valley residents complain that coyotes have become so brazen that they 
enter back yards to stalk and kill pets in broad daylight. One Woodland Hills 
man says that in December a coyote came within six feet of his toddler son 
before it was chased away. Over the weekend animal regulation commissioner 
Lynne Exe renewed her call for a resumption of coyote trapping after the 
discovery of a coyote wounded by gunshot in the back yard of another Woodland 
Hills home.  
</P>
<P>
 Animal control officers attribute the increase in coyote attacks and sightings 
not to the trapping ban, but to recent floods, wildfires, droughts and other 
events that have driven the animals out of their hillside habitats and into 
urban neighborhoods in search of food. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the escalating complaints, the Board of Animal Regulation 
Commissioners instructed its general manager to re-examine the city's policy 
and draft recommendations to address the new coyote problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Coyotes for the most part are not a threat to humans, wildlife biologists say. 
In Los Angeles County, animal regulation officials reported 15,276 animal bites 
on humans in 1993, none by coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
 But coyotes do grow bold when they begin to rely on neighborhood food sources 
and, in the process, lose their fear of people. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual 1985 study, a Pomona College biologist compared the habits of 
coyotes in Claremont, where city-issued garbage cans have permanently attached 
lids, and Glendale, where lids were not attached. 
</P>
<P>
 The biologist's analysis of coyote droppings and coyote carcasses showed that 
coyotes in the Glendale area ate about 15 times as much human-generated garbage 
as coyotes in Claremont. He concluded that tightly fitted trash can lids made 
the difference.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CRYSTAL COVE; FIRE-RAVAGED PARK ACREAGE TO REOPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The phones have been ringing at Crystal Cove State Park in recent weeks with 
people curious to know when the park will fully reopen after being shut down by 
October's devastating fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, rangers at the state park can pass out the good news: About 2,400 
acres of prime hiking, biking and equestrian trails will be open to the public 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long six months," said Michael Eaton, supervising ranger at 
Crystal Cove. "The park is ready for people to come out and enjoy, as long as 
they do it responsibly." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire blackened most of the canyons and grasslands in the recessed, western 
reaches of the park. The 400 acres of coastal park were relatively unscathed by 
the blaze and have remained open. 
</P>
<P>
 Flora in the back areas of the park have taken root, but Eaton urged future 
park users to be cautious. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the vegetation being burnt off, the park is wide open," he said. "People 
will be tempted to go off and explore. What happens is new trails are created, 
which causes erosion gullies," Eaton said. "And they might be stomping on new 
plants." 
</P>
<P>
 Most trails have been restored, but Eaton said some may have some rough spots 
and mountain bikers should be careful. 
</P>
<P>
 Three overnight campsites that were destroyed in the fire will not be open. 
Eaton said park officials are applying for federal grants to replace the 
facilities, which might reopen in about six months.FRANK MESSINA

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 
COINCIDENCES LEAD TO ARREST OF SUSPECT IN HOLDUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A series of coincidences helped police arrest a man who they say was 
responsible for about two dozen armed robberies of San Fernando Valley 
businesses, most of them on Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas McMann, 37, who police called a transient, was being held at the Van 
Nuys jail and was charged Tuesday with three counts of robbery and one count of 
assault with a deadly weapon for allegedly robbing three merchants.Victims said 
that the robber would brandish a gun and, after taking the cash, forced them to 
lie on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities first learned of the suspect's identity Friday when a woman 
visiting the Los Angeles Police Department's West Valley Division on other 
business happened to see a composite drawing of the robber and identified him 
as McMann to the desk officer, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The desk officer, Ken Knox, did a computer check and found that police had 
briefly held McMann in custody for several days at the beginning of March for 
an unrelated crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after McMann was identified, police said, Knox spotted him walking 
along Roscoe Boulevard near Louise Avenue in Van Nuys and arrested him. McMann 
is being held in lieu of $300,000 bail.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; SLAIN STUDENT RECALLED AS DEDICATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO and DANIELLE FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cathy Torrez, the Cal State Fullerton honor student slain nearly two months 
ago, was remembered at a memorial service Wednesday as a dedicated and caring 
person whose smile touched many hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us at Cal State Fullerton were both shocked and overcome with grief 
when we learned of the tragic, senseless and untimely death of Cathy," said the 
university's president, Milton A. Gordon. "Cathy was a student whom we pointed 
to with pride, because she was an exemplary role model for other students." 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 people -- friends, faculty and administrators at Cal State Fullerton 
-- attended the service in Titan Pavilion on campus. They were asked to 
contribute to the Cathy Torrez Memorial Scholarship fund, which has already 
raised about $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The service was also intended to keep Torrez's memory fresh until the mystery 
surrounding her death can be solved. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of Torrez, a 20-year-old sociology student, was found in the trunk of 
her red 1990 Toyota Corolla on Feb. 19 in the parking lot of Placentia-Linda 
Community Hospital. She was last seen driving her car on Feb. 12, when she 
disappeared after leaving her job at a Sav-On Drug Store on Yorba Linda 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Wednesday, Torrez was recognized by the Placentia City Council and a 
local Girl Scout troop that planted a tree in her memory at Kramer Park. The 
tree is visible from the home, which faces the park, of Torrez's mother and 
stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a good day, the tree will be helpful. On bad days, I hope it gives me 
strength," said Mary Bennett, the dead girl's mother. "I can look out and see 
it from my window and my front porch and it will serve as an inspiration to 
never give up the fight to find the person or persons responsible for Cathy's 
death." 
</P>
<P>
 Placentia Police Chief Manuel Ortega said that while the search for Torrez's 
killer continues, he has reduced the number of investigators looking into 
Torrez's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrez, who had recently been honored as one of Cal State Fullerton's top 
sociology students, had planned to be a social worker or juvenile probation 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met Cathy once and was so impressed by her," said Delicia Rich, a Cal State 
Fullerton secretary in the student affairs office. "She was a tiny, little 
thing and all you could see was her big smile. . . . We need to keep her memory 
alive to, hopefully, find out what happened to her." 
</P>
<P>
 Torrez had spent many years as a volunteer tutor and worked as a bilingual 
aide in two Placentia schools.  
</P>
<P>
 Torrez's sister, Tina Lopez, said her sister valued education, noting that the 
scholarship fund will allow someone else to pursue the dreams that for Torrez 
were violently cut short. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still hoping and praying that whoever killed my sister will be brought 
to justice," Martin Torrez said. MIMI KO and DANIELLE FOUQUETTE

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MONTEREY PARK; MAILER 
IS ATTEMPT TO INTIMIDATE VOTERS, STATE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A consultant for a development company that had wanted to build a card club in 
Monterey Park last year sent out a mailer to 13,000 city residents apparently 
designed to discourage "eligible citizens from voting" in an upcoming City 
Council election, according to an investigation by the Secretary of State's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven G. Mott, a consultant for BCTC Development Corp., sent the 
English/Chinese mailing within the past few days, highlighting rules and 
regulations regarding voting by mail, said acting Secretary of State Tony 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Monterey Park Councilman Sam Kiang, who is seeking reelection and forced the 
developer to drop the card club bid last year by having the council state its 
opposition, said he believes Chinese Americans who support him were the target 
of the mailer. 
</P>
<P>
 The mailer contained various provisions from the Elections Code and was 
prefaced with the statement: "To avoid fines up to $10,000 and/or penalties up 
to 36 months' imprisonment for illegal voting practices, understand and obey 
the law." No return address was included but it was purported to be from 
Sacramento, Kiang said. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter will be referred to the district attorney's office for 
investigation of possible violations of the Elections Code with respect to the 
intimidation of voters, Miller said.  
</P>
<P>
 "After a preliminary investigation by this office, it appears that the mailing 
was intended and is having the effect of discouraging eligible citizens from 
voting," said Miller.  
</P>
<P>
 BCTC officials confirmed that Mott was a company consultant but said he was on 
sick leave and they could not comment on the mailer. Telephone calls to Mott 
were not returned.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: GRIFFITH PARK; BABY 
BORN TO HOMELESS COUPLE IN CRITICAL CONDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A baby boy born prematurely to a homeless couple living in Griffith Park 
remained in critical condition Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple were camping in a remote canyon about three-fourths of a mile from 
the Griffith Observatory when the child was born in their tent Tuesday 
afternoon.Shortly after the birth, the father flagged down a park patrol 
officer, who hiked to the camp and radioed for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger Doug Kilpatrick was one of those who answered the call. He said he and 
park patrol Officer Sean Hennessey administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation, 
then carried the infant back to their truck and drove him to Childrens 
Hospital, continuing to give CPR on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother was carried out on a stretcher and transported by ambulance to 
Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center. She was released 
Wednesday, but her baby remained in the neonatal intensive care unit at 
Childrens Hospital.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA; CITY DRAFTING 
NEW PLAN TO SELL WORLD CUP TICKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that World Cup officials have squelched one Pasadena plan to fund economic 
development through soccer ticket sales, city officials are drafting another 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday is to consider a plan to sell the coveted tickets 
to out-of-town business people who might be persuaded to set up shop in 
Pasadena, said Assistant City Manager Edmund F. Sotelo. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena secured the right to sell 9,000 World Cup tickets at face value as 
part of an agreement to stage eight World Cup matches, including the final, at 
the Rose Bowl. The prices of those tickets range from $25 to $475. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had earmarked 1,000 of those tickets for sale by the Chamber of 
Commerce, which planned to sell tiles, bearing the name of the purchasers, to 
be set in a plaza in front of the Rose Bowl. The purchasers of $1,000 tiles 
would have been entitled to buy a World Cup ticket at face value. 
</P>
<P>
 But World Cup officials recently rejected that plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the organizing committee's policy on all of our tickets that they are 
not to be resold (to generate a profit)," said World Cup spokesman John 
Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
 The city already had set aside 558 additional tickets to sell to out-of-town 
business people to promote the city, and the 1,000 tickets that were to be sold 
by the chamber probably will be included in the plan, he said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN INSULTS KING JURY; 
MISTRIAL DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A request for a mistrial in Rodney G. King's civil lawsuit against the city 
was denied Wednesday after jurors complained of being confronted in a 
restaurant by a man who identified them as "Rodney King jurors" and said they 
were "wasting taxpayers' money." 
</P>
<P>
 King's attorney, Milton Grimes, said he made the motion for a mistrial because 
he was concerned about how the incident would affect the jurors, who were 
promised anonymity in the highly publicized case. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know that a civil disorder or riot erupted and was related to a verdict 
in this case," Grimes said. "They also know the city spent over $1 billion 
because of the public's displeasure with a verdict." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge John G. Davies, who questioned each juror individually 
about the incident, turned down the request but did order additional security 
for the jurors during their lunch breaks. The judge admonished them to ignore 
the incident.  
</P>
<P>
 In testimony Wednesday, a doctor said that King's facial injuries were caused 
by an unbroken fall to the asphalt and not by blows from a police baton. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Dallas Long, a Newport Beach emergency room physician, told jurors that 
the fall was visible in the widely seen videotape of King's beating by Los 
Angeles police officers. Long said his findings were based on his observations 
of X-rays and on written reports by other doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Under cross-examination, King's attorney's attacked Long's qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial is being held to determine compensatory damages owed to King by the 
city and punitive damages that could be levied against individuals, including 
the four police officers originally charged with his beating. The city tried to 
settle for $1.25 million; King's lawyers wanted $9.6 million. JOHN L. MITCHELL

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: DOCTOR LEFT CUTTING 
TOOL ON IN MAN'S SPINE, BOARD SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Van Nuys orthopedic surgeon has been accused by state medical authorities of 
leaving a power cutting tool running in a patient's spinal column while he left 
the operating room to make a phone call and go to the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Fereydoune Shirazi also operated on other patients' knees without being 
able to see what he was doing because he was improperly using an instrument 
that enables the surgeon to monitor the operating area within the joint on a TV 
screen, according to the Medical Board of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirazi denied in an interview that he had done anything improper or that he 
endangered or injured any of his patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirazi, 55, could lose his physician's license if an administrative judge 
upholds the board's charges of gross negligence, incompetence and repeated 
negligent acts.  
</P>
<P>
 Les Williams, a supervising investigator for the medical board, said no 
patients were seriously injured. But, he said, "the potential was there for 
some very serious . . . harm." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the board, Shirazi left the operating room for 11 minutes, to 
make a phone call and use the bathroom, in the midst of surgery on a 
30-year-old man's back in 1990 at Westlake Medical Center in Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirazi was using a cutting tool called a nucleotome, activated by a foot 
pedal. When he left the room, he placed a sandbag on the pedal, which kept the 
tool's blades rotating in the man's spine, the board said.  
</P>
<P>
 Shirazi, who is certified as an orthopedic surgeon, acknowledged that he 
"forgot to turn . . . off" the nucleotome. But he added: "A few minutes later, 
an anesthesiologist, who was standing by, did turn it off." He said the device 
is designed only to cut away degenerated spinal disk tissue and cannot cut 
healthy tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also alleged that Shirazi operated "in a blind manner" on three 
patients' knees. During such operations, surgical tools are inserted into the 
knee through one incision. A lens connected to a TV monitor is inserted through 
another incision so doctors can see where their instruments are, and what they 
are doing, inside the joint. 
</P>
<P>
 The board said Shirazi never managed to get his instruments positioned 
properly so he could see the operation on the TV screen. That meant he was in 
danger of removing or damaging tissue he could not see, the board said. 
</P>
<P>
 During an operation on the left knee of a 36-year-old man at Simi Valley 
Hospital in 1991, Shirazi "was essentially lost," according to the board. The 
physician "had to be instructed or prompted on numerous occasions, as to where 
he was within the joint, and had a great deal of difficulty maneuvering the 
scope," the board said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirazi's work was monitored during the operation by a hospital-appointed 
proctor, Dr. H. William Frank, then chief of surgery at Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank, an orthopedist who has since left the hospital staff, said what Shirazi 
did "was kind of the straw that broke the camel's back," and prompted the 
hospital to suspend his surgical privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirazi denied having any trouble with his instruments during the procedure. 
He blamed his problems with the medical board on Frank, whose report touched 
off the state investigation. JACK CHEEVERS

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; ASSAILANT SHOOTS 6 OUTSIDE NIGHTCLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six men were shot, one of them seriously, by an unknown assailant outside a 
popular nightclub here early Wednesday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The six injured were among the late-night crowd leaving the Prestigio Tower 
Bar and Grill on South Anaheim Boulevard as it closed at 2 a.m. Police said 
they have no suspect or motive in the shooting, in which the assailant fired a 
large caliber, semiautomatic weapon at the front door, spraying the area with 
15 to 20 bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Shurtliff, 21, was the most seriously injured, shot in the abdomen. He 
is in critical condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange, where he underwent 
surgery Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The other victims were not seriously injured and have either been released or 
are in fair or good condition at three area hospitals. They are: Mark Sahagun, 
22; Donald Davis, 23; Altan Aksu, 25; Konstadinos Tsimahidis, 22, and Sunly Sa, 
22. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Michael Foster, who is heading the investigation, said police are 
following all leads, including a report that the attacker may have been 
retaliating after being asked to leave the club earlier in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are also checking a rumor that the assailant is a misguided Los Angeles 
Dodgers fan who heard a report that troubled Dodger slugger Darryl Strawberry 
spent part of Saturday night and Sunday morning at the club, Foster said. 
Strawberry failed to appear for the final game of the Dodgers-Angels Freeway 
Series on Sunday afternoon. The nightspot confirmed that Strawberry was at the 
club the night before the Sunday game. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster described the .30-caliber bullets used in the shooting as "one of the 
most common calibers around; he could've used" any kind of weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The club owners declined to comment. A club employee said the place has had an 
occasional fight, "but nothing serious like this has happened. This is the 
biggest problem we ever had. 
</P>
<P>
 "This type of thing happens in L.A., it happens here. There are idiots up 
there and there are idiots here," said the employee, who declined to give his 
name. FERNANDO ROMERO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; APPEAL FILED TO STOP LEISURE WORLD BRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of 242 angry Leisure World residents want the Orange County 
Environmental Management Agency to reconsider its recent decision to allow 
construction of a golf cart bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents became upset when the agency's decision was announced last week, and 
over the Easter weekend, they raised enough money -- $760 -- to file an appeal 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the appeal, the residents said they were appalled to learn that the Golden 
Rain Foundation -- Leisure World's business trustee organization that votes on 
property uses -- voted 5 to 4 to have Smith's market build the bridge over 
Moulton Parkway. In addition, Smith's would also pay $249,000 in exchange for 
an access road. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Parkway, a six-lane street, divides Leisure World. About 300 golfers 
who live on the west side of the street now must wait at a stoplight to cross 
over to the other side, where the golf course is, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the vote by the foundation board, the Environmental Management Agency 
also approved the bridge construction, which would have begun as early as next 
week if residents had not appealed the decision, officials said. Now, residents 
are waiting for the agency to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's offered to buy a Leisure World-owned road behind the market on the 
west side of Moulton Parkway about two years ago for $700,000 so trucks can 
easily enter, drop off and pick up merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 But last month, the foundation struck a deal with the market requiring Smith's 
to build a golf cart bridge, which is estimated to cost about $400,000, and pay 
$249,000 over a period of seven years. In return, Smith's would get Leisure 
World's road. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said they do not want the bridge and would rather have the 
foundation spend the money from the sale of the road on something that would 
please everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael O'Malley, a retired Orange County workers' compensation judge and 
Leisure World resident, said the foundation's decision to build a golf cart 
bridge that would prohibit anyone except golf cart drivers from using it is 
unfair. About 98.5% of the community's 20,000 residents do not golf or own golf 
carts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat H. Green, a foundation trustee who voted for the bridge construction last 
month, said she regrets her action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I hadn't voted in favor" of the bridge, she said, explaining that she 
did not have enough time to study the impact of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Green, 75, said she tried on Tuesday to get the board to renegotiate a deal 
with Smith's, but her request was ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-foot-wide golf cart bridge "will serve just a few people," Green said. 
"It's very discriminatory to everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 She added that in addition to the 242 residents who appealed the agency's 
decision, many more are against the bridge construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation board member Earl D. Donaldson, who voted for the bridge, said it 
would be locked and guarded at night and would provide safety for its users 
when it is open during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Crossing Moulton Parkway is dangerous, said Donaldson, 76. "The traffic is 
extremely fast," he said. "People have been hit and there's been many near 
accidents." 
</P>
<P>
 Green said she and hundreds of other residents would rather have Smith's pay 
$700,000 for the road upfront. She said the money could then be used for 
lessening residents' monthly maintenance charges, which range from $200 to $500 
for each household, to upkeep Leisure World grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Agency officials said they will respond to the residents' appeal with a 
hearing within 45 days.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; DORNAN RIDE-ALONG A TRIP ON THE MILD SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was supposed to be a chance for Rep. Robert K. Dornan to get an up-close 
look at life on the mean streets of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking off his wool sports coat and loosening his tie a bit, Dornan (R-Garden 
Grove) climbed into the front seat of a patrol car Tuesday night to learn how 
much the city's crime problem has changed since he rode with police the last 
time, during his first campaign to represent the central Orange County district 
10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 At the outset, Dornan said he wanted to see real police work, "things we never 
see during the daytime driving through certain corners and intersections," he 
told his police escort, Officer Bruce Leamer. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Dornan, crime took most of the night off. 
</P>
<P>
 The only action he saw during his four hours with Santa Ana police was a fight 
among three growling stray dogs. There were no arrests on Dornan's watch. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminals "are on their good behavior," Dornan quipped as he entered the 
final hour of his tour. "They know their congressman is out here tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan, who has been criticized in the past by his Democratic opponents for 
not spending enough time in his district, was demonstrating his concern about 
Santa Ana's crime. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Dornan said he expects to win approval this year of his proposed 
"police corps" program that would provide a four-year college education in 
return for four years of service in a state or local police department. 
</P>
<P>
 But the quiet ride through Santa Ana still proved to be a learning experience 
for the congressman, who planned to spend Wednesday night in South Central Los 
Angeles -- ground zero of the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hispanic transvestites?" he asked Leamer, as they cruised through downtown 
Santa Ana. "That's a new one to me." 
</P>
<P>
 He also seemed surprised to learn that Santa Ana is the second most densely 
populated city in the state behind San Francisco. He learned about a large gang 
made up of illegal immigrants organized to defend themselves against the more 
established gangs, and he asked Leamer how police handle illegal immigrants who 
have committed crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 As the cruiser turned onto Third Street, Leamer pointed to shadows of figures 
that quickly jumped over a wall as the headlights turned toward them. Across 
the street, a house was covered with graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at all this graffiti and the house boarded up. And we're just on the 
edge of the Civic Center?" Dornan asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a wrong turn, let me tell you," Leamer responded. "It's a popular 
street for carjackings." 
</P>
<P>
 Leamer told Dornan war stories and took him to the scenes of past battles 
between police and gang members. They cruised through some notorious 
neighborhoods, including the Willard area, El Salvador Park and the so-called 
"Weed and Seed" neighborhood in central Santa Ana, which received $1.4 million 
in a special federal program designed to weed out crime and plant the seeds for 
neighborhood pride and redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan had his own war stories -- nostalgically recounting his efforts to 
remove an adult theater on Seventeenth Street and helping Santa Ana get funding 
for anti-crime and capital improvement programs. 
</P>
<P>
 As he was riding down Fourth Street, which was redeveloped several years ago 
with federal urban renewal funds, Dornan lamented that "it didn't stay quite as 
upscale as I thought." 
</P>
<P>
 But if the quiet of the night surprised Dornan, he was even more amazed by the 
look of the city, often commenting that the graffiti was not as widespread as 
he had imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a decent-looking street," Dornan said of one area that was described 
as unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is relative," he added. "When I go to the (former) Soviet Union, I 
think about an area like this, the number of cars and shops, Laundromats and 
restaurants. . . . They would think they were in heaven (and say), 'Oh yeah, 
boy, this is great.' " GEBE MARTINEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; CITY NEGOTIATING TO BRING SAND TO BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials don't expect a repeat of the minor flooding that affected more 
than a dozen beachfront homes over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Waves as high as 10 feet pounded the coast late Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to homes along Seal Way was limited mostly to flooded garages and 
saturated lawns. 
</P>
<P>
 The homes stand at a narrow beach that the city hopes to widen with up to 
150,000 cubic yards of sand from the Santa Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
 The beach runs between the Seal Beach Pier and Anaheim Bay and has been 
eroding for decades. Residents fear the homes may one day face a serious threat 
from the ocean if sand is not replenished. 
</P>
<P>
 Each winter, the city builds an 18-foot-high sand berm in front of the homes 
to prevent high tides from causing damage. It was removed a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, these high tides don't occur at this time of the season," said Lee 
Whittenberg, the city's planning director. "In talking with the lifeguards, 
this was a pretty unusual occurrence." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials this week were negotiating a $500,000 deal to bring Santa Ana 
River sand to Seal Beach. It would come from a river flood control project, 
Whittenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes as planned, the river sand will begin arriving at the beach later 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is scheduled to discuss the sand replenishment project at its 
Monday meeting. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; EX-OFFICER SENTENCED FOR THEFTS AT UCI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN RAY BALLOU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former UC Irvine police officer pleaded no contest Wednesday to charges of 
stealing computers and other electronic equipment from the campus and was 
sentenced to one year in Orange County Jail and five years of probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Eric Roberts, 34, pleaded no contest in Harbor Municipal Court to 36 
criminal charges, including felony residential and commercial burglary and 
receiving and selling stolen property.  
</P>
<P>
 Campus police investigators alleged that between December, 1990, and October, 
1993, while Roberts was an officer with the university's police force, he stole 
computer equipment, videocassette recorders, and other items from classrooms, 
offices and a dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Roberts' duty on campus during that time was to closely monitor 
those areas, because a rash of burglaries was occurring at other colleges in 
the Los Angeles and Orange County areas, said UCI Chief of Police Kathy 
Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office was able to retrieve about $40,000 worth of the 
equipment, some from Roberts' home in Trabuco Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, a nine-year veteran, was put on administrative leave in October, then 
fired on Dec. 20 as a result of an investigation that began after a Cal State 
Fullerton student became suspicious of a computer his roommate borrowed from 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 The student, who had been working as a computer programmer at the Cal State 
Fullerton Police Department, noticed that the computer was similar to the 
university's, and even had a sticky surface in the exact spot where the 
university places identification numbers on its computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The student then asked campus police to run a check on the computer. The check 
revealed that the computer had been stolen from UC Irvine, and police traced it 
to a person who said he had bought it from Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a shock to find out that he had stolen property," Stanley said. "He 
really did nothing to let us believe that he was capable" of the thefts. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley said that Roberts carried a master key and spent a lot of time 
checking buildings throughout the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Randy Pawloski said Roberts would sell the property to 
friends or acquaintances and may even have sold some at garage sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Craig Robinson ordered Roberts to pay restitution of $12,873 to 
purchasers of the stolen computers. 
</P>
<P>
 He faced a maximum of 11 years in prison, but was given the lesser sentence 
because he had no record, said Pawloski, who had argued for at least a 
four-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The counts against Roberts also included felony possession of nunchakus, a 
martial arts weapon, and a misdemeanor possession of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to reach Roberts and his attorney were unsuccessful Wednesday.BRIAN

top. "They make that by hand? All that stuff?" the 11-year-old inquired. "I 
like it but I want to know who wrote on that egg." Sure enough, the egg bears 
the cryptic marking "topo" -- which looks like graffiti but is really part of 
the artwork. 
</P>
<P>
 As tourists, the 110 fifth-graders from the 97th Street Elementary School in 
South-Central Los Angeles missed few details. They arrived Wednesday morning by 
school bus, squinting into the sunlight that streamed across the Watercourt of 
California Plaza. They marched dutifully down the steps into the plaza and 
arranged themselves on courtyard steps, where they were welcomed by a host of 
officials, including City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas. But they were hardly 
the usual tourists and this was not the typical tour. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was to introduce them to Downtown, a place they rarely go, and to 
what could become their future. Here would be a glimpse of the buildings (such 
as First Interstate World Center, the city's tallest), the people, the art. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope you look forward to the day when you can have a job Downtown," said 
John Gray, executive vice president of First Interstate Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "You might want to be a planner, an architect . . . a real estate developer," 
said Herbert Marshall of the Community Redevelopment Agency, which co-sponsored 
the tour with the Downtown Marketing Council as part of an effort to establish 
links between Downtown and outlying neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a walking tour, but a lot of trotting was involved. "Come on, 
slowpokes!" teacher Otha Willis Jr. called cheerfully but crisply to the 
stragglers in the back of the line as it snaked across the street toward First 
Interstate World Center. 
</P>
<P>
 There was as much looking ahead as looking up to observe all the edges of the 
skyline. "The weather's not as hot as where I stay," said one student, 
Sharmaine Robinson. In the lobby of First Interstate they were met by a passel 
of name-tagged executive assistants who ushered them through the halls of the 
eighth-tallest building in the world. They giggled and held their ears as the 
elevators shot up 54 floors and then up another 12 to the vacant 66th floor. 
Once out of the elevators, they scampered with delight to the windows that 
surround the circular floor offering a panoramic, if hazy, view. 
</P>
<P>
 They peered down on a rooftop tennis court and pointed to a passing 
helicopter. "Oh, my goodness, I feel like I'm on top of the world right now!" 
10-year-old Daisy Morales declared dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Some professed a fear of heights. "I haven't been able to look down," said 
Nyeisha Bryant, 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Treading the plush sea-green carpet of the 10th floor, the real estate 
division, they shushed each other repeatedly and walked silently past offices 
revealing lives they could see but not touch. "Feel free to look in the 
offices," said George Lockhart, the First Interstate staffer guiding the tour. 
People in offices occasionally smiled or waved as they walked by. The tour 
never paused. "Ooh, pretty flowers," said one girl as she passed a vase of red 
roses on someone's desk. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice, it's beautiful, it has new things," said 11-year-old Joannie 
Pineda as she left the building. 
</P>
<P>
 At the next stop, the Central Library, they walked past the fountain-lined 
entrance to the rotunda, where they were all given library cards. "As you grow 
up, you'll find your life is embodied in plastic," Marshall told them as he 
passed packets of library cards to their teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hurry, hurry, hurry!" a teacher called as they scurried across Grand Street 
from the library to the Biltmore Hotel for a quick walk-through. They were told 
to note the ornate walls and ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow, there's a lady painting there," said William Bias, 10, as he spied a 
woman high on a scaffolding gingerly touching up a portion of the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've never seen a lady before?" Jason Faulkner ribbed him. 
</P>
<P>
 They filed through the hotel lobby in near silence as requested. They were 
model tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad people notice that," said teacher Faye Walton. "I think a lot of 
people outside the inner city don't have a good perception of us. You can see 
the apprehension in their eyes when you show up someplace. I say, 'Excuse me, 
the children we bring are well-behaved.' " 
</P>
<P>
 They bounded out of the Biltmore toward Pershing Square just as the 
computerized carillon in the purple tower in the square rang out the noon hour. 
They grabbed box lunches and nestled in groups on the sunny grass. Turkey and 
ham sandwiches, fruit, cookies and potato chips. "230 calories!" cried one girl 
reading the grim nutritional facts on the bag of chips. She dug in anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 After lunch, Deidra Aubrey, who brought her camera, had time for one quick 
photo. A group of friends huddled together in Pershing Square, with the 
Biltmore in the background, and she snapped the picture.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; CITY TO BUY RECYCLED PLASTIC PARK BENCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Picnickers and visitors to local parks this summer will be using benches and 
picnic tables made from recycled soda bottles and milk jugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to buy 12 picnic tables and 27 benches, all made of a product 
called "plastic lumber." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope the city's use of the recycled product will make park-goers 
more aware of the need to recycle to save natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping we reach three generations of park-goers so that they can close 
the loop and buy recycled products themselves," said Susan Lynn, environmental 
programs manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Each bench is made from some 900 recycled plastic soda and milk jugs, while 
some 8,000 go into one picnic table. The recycled park furniture has a life 
span of about 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the benches and picnic tables, which are designed to accommodate 
people in wheelchairs, is about $14,000. The City Council on Tuesday 
appropriated $7,000 in park bond money for the project. It will match a grant 
received under the Beverage Container Recycling Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor John J. Collins said use of the grant money combines environmental 
awareness with fiscal responsibility, adding that the plastic furniture helps 
to "educate people that this is a viable use for products that we traditionally 
have been sending to the landfill." 
</P>
<P>
 The recycled benches and tables will be placed at 12 neighborhood parks and at 
the Fountain Valley Recreation and Cultural Center.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; SCHOOL WORKERS TO DECIDE ON STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Classified employees in the Orange Unified School District are poised to 
strike over the district's refusal to renegotiate a school board-imposed 
contract, which union officials say amounts to "union-busting." 
</P>
<P>
 At a 5 p.m. meeting today, union employees will decide whether to strike in 
the wake of a controversial contract approved by the Board of Education in 
March. The contract cuts health benefits, imposes furloughs and empowers the 
district to lay off union employees or reduce their working hours without 
negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, I'm finding the attitude within the union is, enough is enough," 
said Becky Mayers, president of the California School Employees Assn., Chapter 
67. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayers said classified employees have not had a raise since 1988, and took a 
2.59% pay cut last year.  
</P>
<P>
 The union represents 1,160 non-teaching professionals, including bus drivers 
and maintenance, food service and clerical workers. The last and only time the 
union walked out was a one-day sickout in 1989, Mayers said. 
</P>
<P>
 While admitting a strike would "hamper" the district, officials say they have 
contingency plans to cope with busing an estimated 7,000 students to school and 
providing before- and after-school child care for hundreds of students at 24 
elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our intent that we will carry on," said Jack Elsner, the district's head 
of personnel. "A strike will hamper us, no doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 The schools are also prepared to supply students with breakfast and lunch as 
before, Elsner said. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members say the contract, the result of 11 months of 
negotiations, is final. Classified employees should share the burden, along 
with the teachers and administration, in making up a $2.2-million shortfall 
facing the district this year, they argue. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract, which would save $484,113, is crucial for the district's 
financial health, district officials said. Under the contract, classified 
employees would be forced to take three furlough days, and some would have to 
pay up to $87 a month to maintain their current level of health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are hopeful things can be worked out to avoid a strike," said board 
President Maureen Aschoff.  
</P>
<P>
 Union officials said they are especially outraged over a contract clause that 
gives the district the power to lay off workers or cut their hours without 
negotiation. For example, the clause would enable the district to save on 
health benefits by laying off a full-time employee, and then hiring two 
part-time workers to fill the spot. (Employers do not have to pay part-time 
employees health benefits.) 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the craziest thing about the contract," Mayers said. "If we allow them 
to implement that, next year there might not be benefits to fight over." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsner conceded that the contract clause gives the district power to lay off 
workers without negotiation, but said its potential use is being exaggerated by 
the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of their contract, district teachers are not allowed to support a 
strike by the classified employees, said David Reger, head of the teachers 
union. Teachers who honor picket lines would be subject to dismissal, he said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; 2 BOYS ARE EXPELLED OVER MARIJUANA DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two boys were expelled by the Fountain Valley School District last week for 
possession and sale of marijuana on a school campus. 
</P>
<P>
 A 14-year-old was expelled for the remainder of the school year for selling 
marijuana, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the expulsion of a 13-year-old, who had marijuana on campus, was suspended 
by the Board of Trustees. He will be allowed to attend another school in the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley police said both boys were arrested March 17 at Fred Moiola 
School. Police Sgt. Dann Bean said the younger boy bought a small amount of 
marijuana from the older. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials declined to furnish other information about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees had also considered expelling a second-grader who brought a small 
pocketknife to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Larry Crandall said the board decided not to expel the boy because he 
"had it in his jacket pocket and forgot it was there."  
</P>
<P>
 The district has a zero-tolerance policy, meaning students who bring any type 
of weapon to school, including guns or knives, face expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Robert Sedlak said that policy may be too harsh and that the 
board should reconsider it. In the case of the second-grader, for example, "it 
was an innocent situation," he said. "The policy is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Trustee Julie Hoxsie said she believes the policy is not excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that in the other cases, the policy did its job," Hoxsie said. "This 
is the first time where it was an accident and we had to view it in a different 
light. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other part is that we have an obligation to protect our students and 
staff. A knife on campus, depending on the intent, could be a threat to 
students and staff."DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; COMMUNITY SERVICE FEES RAISED BY CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council raised some community service fees this week, and extended a 
temporary ordinance that places strict controls on adult entertainment 
businesses that might seek to open in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted unanimously to increase the fees to recover the costs of 
providing services to residents and others.None of the new fees are higher than 
the costs to the city, according to city officials. The fees take effect July 1 
and are expected to generate $81,000 in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, park reservation fees will increase from a standard $5 to $25 for 
small groups of residents and go as high as $225 for commercial users from 
outside the city, according to a report. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also voted 3 to 2 for a $3 fee for identification cards for 
workers who use the Costa Mesa Job Center. The center at 1697 Placentia Ave. 
provides a place for day laborers to apply for work and meet potential 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Mary Hornbuckle and Jay Humphrey opposed the $3 fee. The state 
ordered the city this year to verify workers' legal status and authorization to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimously approved ordinance to control adult bookstores, topless bars 
and other adult businesses requires police to run a background check on people 
seeking to open such businesses. Businesses will also be required to locate at 
least 500 feet from residences and 1,000 feet from other adult businesses, 
parks, schools and churches. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; POLICE START PROGRAM TO REDUCE CAR THEFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police have embarked on a new auto-theft prevention program that gives 
officers permission to stop participants' vehicles if they are spotted on the 
road during certain early morning hours. 
</P>
<P>
 People wishing to take part in the Combat Auto Theft program must bring 
driver's licenses and vehicle registrations to the police station, at 1 Civic 
Center Plaza. Participants will sign waiver forms allowing police to pull over 
their cars between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 To identify vehicles in the program, police place a bright yellow sticker on 
the rear windows of participants' cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Combat Auto Theft program began last month, 26 residents have 
joined, said police Cmdr. Gene Norden. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not for everyone," Norden said. "I don't think people who are out a 
lot at night would want to have one of those on their window." 
</P>
<P>
 Norden said that officers who stop cars with CAT stickers will treat the 
situation as a possible car theft. "They are going to take more precautions 
when making contact with the driver," he said. "People should be aware that 
(the officers) might have their guns drawn." 
</P>
<P>
 Norden said the CAT program tends to be popular with older people and those 
who rarely drive late at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine is one of several Orange County cities to adopt CAT, which was started 
eight years ago in New York City.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, 357 cars were reported stolen in Irvine, and in the first two months 
of this year, 120 were taken, Norden said. 
</P>
<P>
 CAT is free to the public. The forms and stickers are provided by the 
Automobile Club of Southern California. Stolen Vehicles In the first two months 
of this year, 120 cars were stolen Irvine. A look at the auto-theft figures

RUNNER BACK ON TRACK TOWARD OLYMPIC GOAL; RECOVERY: ASHLEY BETHEL RESUMES 
WORKOUTS SIX WEEKS AFTER LOSING AN EYE IN A FREAK ACCIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By E.J. GONG JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With her powerful legs and a passion for winning, Ashley Bethel, 14, has 
rekindled her dream of one day competing in the Olympics, despite a freak 
accident that caused her to lose her right eye. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lake Forest track star, who holds a national age-group record in the long 
jump and has caught the attention of U.S. Olympic track officials, this week 
slipped into running spikes and began the road back to competitive sports. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 22, as she worked out at Saddleback College's track, an errant golf 
ball flew over a protective barrier at a nearby driving range and struck her. 
Doctors couldn't save the eye. 
</P>
<P>
 As she started practicing for the first time since the accident, Bethel 
complained of feeling stiff and out of condition. Yet she is determined more 
than ever to achieve her goal, although that means overcoming such difficulties 
as judging distances, especially in the long jump. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be hard, I know, but I won't give up. I love winning too much," 
Bethel said, a tan bandage covering her right eye socket. Both Bethel and her 
coach-father, Skip Bethel, know there will be a lot of hard work and pain along 
the way. But with daily workouts and night training at home, there's no time 
for self-doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, she's about 60% of what she was before the accident," Skip Bethel 
said, watching Ashley finish a 100-meter practice sprint at the Trabuco Hills 
High School track. "We've got a lot of work to do." 
</P>
<P>
 At the long jump pits, Ashley worked on getting her steps lined up. With a 
look of frustration, she failed several times to spring off the board without 
going over the mark that voids a jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Ashley said her visual handicap made it difficult to judge the distance 
to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will take some time to get my steps down again," Ashley said. "But I 
will." 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley also said simple tasks such as pouring soda into a cup have become a 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her daughter's terrible experience, Abby Bethel said Ashley never 
complains about her injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "When she came home from the hospital, she made jokes to make us laugh, and 
she told us everything was going to be all right. She's a very strong girl," 
the mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bethels plan to sue the owner of the driving range, Saddleback Valley 
College District, and the management company that operates it, said their 
attorney, Linda Cummings. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley practices with the 15-member Silver Wings Track Club founded in 1989 by 
her father. And whenever she needs inspiration or prodding to work harder, her 
father is always near with a stop watch around his neck and a few words of 
encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
 Skip Bethel, a former running back at Florida State University who formed the 
club to nurture Ashley's talents, said he realized his daughter's ability seven 
years ago at an informal Girl Scout track meet. 
</P>
<P>
 He says Ashley, then a wiry 7-year-old, outran the older competition by about 
50 meters in a 200-meter race. 
</P>
<P>
 "That day, I knew I had something special in her," said her father, a manager 
at McDonnel Douglas in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Ashley, a slender, 5-foot-8 eighth-grader at Los Alisos 
Intermediate School, has consistently outrun and outjumped the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 She is a two-time national youth pentathlon champion whose top long jump mark 
of 19 feet, 7 1/4 inches as a 13-year-old last summer would have placed her 
second in the 1993 California state high school girls' meet. 
</P>
<P>
 She recently received an invitation to work out at the U.S. Olympic Training 
Center in Colorado Springs, Colo. in August. But the most important thing now, 
Ashley said, is preparing for her first test: a meet later this month sponsored 
by the USA Track and Field organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I enjoy most is the competition. I endure the tough workouts and 
the pain, but what I really like to do is win," Ashley said, relaxing after her 
workout, wearing a sweat shirt signed after her injury by Jackie Joyner-Kersee. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyner-Kersee, a two-time Olympic champion and world-record holder in the 
seven-event heptathlon, visited the Bethels' Lake Forest home last month after 
learning about Ashley's accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Other notable track figures, including Mike Powell, Kevin Young and Gail 
Devers, have called Ashley since the accident to give support and inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley also received cards, flowers and donations from strangers who heard 
about the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knowing that people I've never even met before are rooting for me gives me 
strength," Ashley said. Her goal is to beat Joyner-Kersee's heptathlon world 
record, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though losing vision in one eye will greatly affect her balance and require 
adjustment, it is possible for Ashley to fully regain her abilities and to grow 
as an athlete, said Vince O'Boyle, UC Irvine's track coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike baseball or basketball players who rely more on sight, world-class 
track-and-field athletes, in some events like long jump and hurdles, count 
their steps," he said. "There's a certain rhythm which has nothing to do with 
how well you see."

<P>
 The testimony came in the second day of a preliminary hearing in Municipal 
Court in Laguna Niguel to determine if defendants Saul Penuelas, 18, his 
17-year-old brother, Hector, and Julio Perez Bonilla and Rogelio Vasquez Solis, 
both 17, should be tried for murder and other felony charges in the slaying of 
Steve Woods. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, a 17-year-old high school senior from San Clemente, was speared through 
the head with a paint-roller rod during an Oct. 15 confrontation at Calafia 
Beach County Park and died several weeks later, having never regained 
consciousness. He was a passenger in a car pelted by rocks, beer cans, paint 
rollers and other items as it left the beach parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 He and about a dozen friends in four vehicles had gone to the beach after a 
San Clemente High School football game. His friends told investigators they 
were trying to avoid a fight with the other group when they sped from the 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The four defendants, who are being tried as adults, each have been charged 
with one count of murder, one count of conspiracy, 10 counts of assault and one 
count of throwing an item at a moving vehicle. Each also has been charged with 
gang involvement, a charge that could lengthen their sentences if they are 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 The four defendants admitted to throwing items other than paint rollers at the 
vehicles but told investigators they thought the other group was trying to run 
them over, according to testimony from several sheriff's investigators. Six San 
Clemente residents were arrested and charged in the case, which caused outraged 
San Clemente residents to hold meetings, marches and demonstrations to protest 
gangs and youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of alleged gang involvement in the case, however, has become the 
subject of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Latino leaders have challenged statements by police that those charged 
are gang members or gang associates and have said they believe the defendants 
are being "railroaded." They have also accused the news media of inaccurately 
depicting the event as Latinos attacking innocent white youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Alleged gang involvement on the part of the defendants was the focus of much 
testimony Wednesday by sheriff's officials and probation officers who assisted 
in interviewing the defendants.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy probation counselor Luis Valdez testified that Bonilla claimed 
membership in the gang. Another probation counselor, Octavio Gonzalez, 
testified that Saul Penuelas said he also was a gang member and that Solis said 
he sometimes hung out with the gang. Investigator Barth Massey testified that 
Hector Penuelas also said he associated with the gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Two sheets of paper with the gang's initials were found inside the pickup 
driven by Saul Penuelas on the night of the incident, according to testimony by 
sheriff's investigator Hans Strand.

ELECTIONS / 20TH STATE SENATE DISTRICT; ROBERTI BACKED BY OUTSIDERS' MONEY, FOE 
CONTENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 State Sen. David Roberti is trying to buy a victory in the April 12 recall 
election with money donated mostly by supporters from outside the San Fernando 
Valley, challenger Randy Linkmeyer charged on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 90% of the $193,865 in large contributions Roberti reported raising in 
his last campaign finance disclosure report came from people, firms or 
organizations with addresses outside Roberti's 20th Senate District, which 
includes most of the Valley, Linkmeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Linkmeyer, a Canoga Park gun store owner, is one of five candidates seeking to 
replace Roberti if he is recalled by the voters Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti aides responded that Linkmeyer's charges were "totally hypocritical" 
because the recall drive has been heavily underwritten by gun-rights supporters 
from outside the district. Besides, they argued, it is fitting that Roberti get 
outside campaign donations because the recall has become -- by design of the 
anti-Roberti camp itself -- a nationally watched showdown over gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recall (transcends) the 20th District and Senator Roberti -- it's a 
referendum on assault weapons," said Staci Walters, Roberti's press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Linkmeyer, 37, a Sherman Oaks resident and owner of Art's Guns, stepped up his 
attacks on Roberti at a news conference in Van Nuys. "Here's a gentleman 
(Roberti) who is a carpetbagger," Linkmeyer said. "And now here's all this 
money coming from the outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti lives in Los Feliz, outside the district, but rents a home in Van Nuys 
to maintain his legally required residency within its boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times review of those who contributed $100 or more to Roberti's Beat the 
Recall campaign committee confirmed the substance of Linkmeyer's allegation. 
Many of Roberti's biggest contributors came from political action committees 
with headquarters outside the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Linkmeyer, a Republican, said that if he is elected he would seek reforms 
that, among other things, would require that 50% of a candidate's money come 
from within the district they seek to represent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm seeking to give back control of the political process to the people of 
the district," said Linkmeyer, who has developed the most ambitious campaign of 
the five Roberti challengers. "We're not seeing people from the Valley saying 
'Yes, we're for Roberti' and opening up their checkbooks for him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Linkmeyer also said he would support reforms to prevent transfers of campaign 
contributions between candidates so contributors will not have their money 
spent on causes with which they might disagree. Linkmeyer pointed out that 
Roberti's Beat the Recall committee reported getting $7,800 from the campaign 
committees of six other politicians, including those of Sen. Nicholas Petris 
(D-Oakland) and Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-San Jose). 
</P>
<P>
 Such a ban would bring a new honesty to the electoral process, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Roberti aides pointed out that the recall campaign has been heavily 
financed by gun-rights groups from outside the Valley, an observation borne out 
by campaign finance records filed by three organizations most heavily involved 
in sponsoring the recall -- the Coalition to Restore Government Integrity, 
Californians Against Corruption and California Voters Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 The last campaign report filed by Californians Against Corruption, for 
example, showed that only three of this organization's 31 contributions came 
from Valley residents and that four of its eight largest contributors were 
non-Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Linkmeyer's own most recent report showed that only 20% of the $4,328 
he raised came from sources outside the district. 
</P>
<P>
 During his news conference, Linkmeyer also conceded to reporters that he would 
not ban contribution practices that have been employed by gun-rights advocates 
in the Roberti campaign. Asked if he would limit non-monetary contributions by 
outside interests, Linkmeyer said he would not. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall organizers have developed a tactic in which partisans scattered 
throughout the nation get a so-called recall kit that includes a prototype of a 
piece of anti-Roberti mail and a list of voters. The recipients then duplicate 
the piece, and stamp and mail the copies at their own expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Such in-kind contributions would not be affected by the reforms he envisions, 
Linkmeyer told reporters. However, he noted that the same exception would be 
available to all. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development Wednesday, Roberti teamed up with Democratic 
gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown to propose legislation to tighten a 1989 
law Roberti wrote that bans military-style semiautomatic weapons in California. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference in San Francisco, the pair called for amending state law 
to ban an entire breed of firearms they would define as assault weapons. 
Currently, the ban applies to about 60 weapons identified by their brand names, 
such as the Uzi or AK-47. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to Roberti's aides, weapons makers skirt the law by producing 
"copycat" weapons, basically identical to the banned firearms, but exempt from 
its provisions because they are different in some small way. To prevent this, 
Roberti and Brown are now proposing a new generic definition of what 
constitutes an assault weapon. "It's time to end the assault-weapons maker's 
game," according to a press release from Roberti's office about the new 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the recall drive has been heavily influenced by gun-rights advocates 
angered by the senator's 1989 ban, Roberti's decision to publicly advocate an 
even more restrictive law appeared to some observers to signal confidence in 
the Roberti camp that the recall battle is as good as won. A Times poll taken 
two weeks ago showed Roberti with a wide lead.

REACTION TO TEAMSTERS STRIKE MIXED; CASTAIC: UNION MEMBERS JOIN PICKET LINES, 
BUT INDEPENDENT COUNTERPARTS AT ONE TRUCK STOP SAY THEY NEED TO KEEP WORKING TO 
SURVIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Reaction to a nationwide strike by the Teamsters union against nearly two 
dozen major trucking companies ranged from unabashed resentment to guarded 
sympathy Wednesday as independent truckers who stopped at a popular Castaic 
truck stop contemplated the fate of their union counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80,000 Teamsters walked off their jobs and on to picket lines, in 
protest of freight companies' plans to hire more part-time workers and shift 
more business to railroads. 
</P>
<P>
 About two dozen union members picketed in front of Roadway Express Inc. 
trucking company in Pacoima. Teamsters from locals 208 and 63 also formed 
picket lines at three other San Fernando Valley locations. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Castaic stop just off the Golden State Freeway at Lake Hughes Road, 
truckers from California, Colorado, Nevada and even Canada said they doubted 
that the strike would result in any significant changes in freight companies' 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't affect the trucking industry because they'll never get everyone 
together," said Joe Jackson, an independent truck driver based in Fallon, Nev. 
"There's too many independent guys who are hungry." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles trucker Scott Williams said he has watched a move away from 
well-paid union drivers to cheaper non-union truckers evolve over his 13-year 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know people are cutting out the unions," said Williams, an independent 
contract driver. "I don't agree with it, but that's the way it's going." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said he knows that he and other independent drivers are undercutting 
the Teamsters by agreeing to ship goods at a cheaper rate, but he echoed 
Jackson when he said it all boils down to an issue of survival. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got to eat, too," Williams said as he sat inside his 18-wheeler surrounded 
by the thick odor of diesel fumes that filled the air around the truck stop. 
</P>
<P>
 But resentment could be detected in the voices of other truckers who said they 
believe the Teamsters are trying to improve on an already good deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the unions are going too far," said Ken Huntley, a trucker from 
Calgary, Canada. "They're cutting their own throats." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntley, who makes about three trips to California each month to ship paper 
and wood, said that as an independent truck driver he works without the 
benefits, truck insurance and hourly wages that union workers receive. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should count themselves lucky," Huntley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trucker Randy Jenkins, however, said one issue the Teamsters are protesting -- 
shifting more business to railroads -- stands to affect all truck drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a legitimate grievance," Jenkins said. "If they decide to use more 
railroads, we all stand to lose miles and money. Everything is getting too 
dehumanized and more mechanized." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Jenkins, who ships the sort of mozzarella cheese used to top pizzas 
throughout Southern California, said he had little sympathy for the Teamsters' 
other complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the union people have a good deal and they're pushing for more," 
Jenkins said. "Things change, companies have to be competitive, so they got to 
do what they got to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Back inside the cab of his truck, Williams sat waiting for his next 
assignment. As an independent trucker, he lacks the luxury of a set schedule, 
which his union counterparts can count on. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said he waits for hours at a time for work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm waiting for Safeway or Vons to call and tell me to go to Oxnard and pick 
up some celery," Williams said as he waited for the call a little after noon 
Wednesday. "They may not call till 9 p.m. tonight, but it's not costing them 
anything for me to sit here and wait."

SURGEON ACCUSED OF LEAVING TOOL IN PATIENT'S SPINE; MEDICINE: BOARD SAYS HE 
ALSO DID KNEE OPERATIONS WITHOUT SEEING WHAT HE WAS DOING. VAN NUYS DOCTOR 
DENIES ALL CHARGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Van Nuys orthopedic surgeon has been accused by state medical authorities of 
leaving a power cutting tool running in a patient's spinal column while he left 
the operating room to make a phone call and go to the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Fereydoune (Fred) Shirazi also operated on other patients' knees without 
being able to see what he was doing because he was not properly using an 
instrument that enables the surgeon to monitor the operating area within the 
joint on a TV screen, according to the Medical Board of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirazi, a native of Iran who attended medical school in Paris, denied in an 
interview that he had done anything improper or that he endangered or injured 
any of his patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirazi, 55, could lose his physician's license if an administrative judge 
upholds the board's charges of gross negligence, incompetence and repeated 
negligent acts. No hearing date has been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Les Williams, a supervising investigator for the medical board, said no 
patients were seriously injured by Shirazi. But he asserted: "Obviously, this 
guy was being very careless. The potential was there for some very serious . . 
. harm." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the board, Shirazi left the operating room for 11 minutes, to 
make a phone call and use the bathroom, in the midst of surgery on a 
30-year-old man's back in 1990 at Westlake Medical Center in Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirazi was using a cutting tool called a nucleotome, activated by a foot 
pedal. When he left the room, he placed a sandbag on the pedal, which kept the 
nucleotome blades rotating in the man's spine, the board said. 
</P>
<P>
 That action exposed the man, who was under local anesthesia, to serious risk 
of injury, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirazi, who is board-certified as an orthopedic surgeon, acknowledged that he 
"forgot to turn . . . off" the nucleotome when he left to relieve himself. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added: "A few minutes later, an anesthesiologist, who was standing by, 
did turn it off." He said that, in any event, the device is designed only to 
cut away degenerated spinal disk tissue and cannot cut healthy tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also alleged that Shirazi operated "in a blind manner" on three 
other patients' knees. 
</P>
<P>
 During such operations, surgical tools are inserted into the knee through one 
incision. A telescope-like lens connected to a TV monitor is inserted through 
another incision, so doctors can see where their instruments are, and what they 
are doing, inside the joint. 
</P>
<P>
 The board said Shirazi never managed to get his instruments positioned 
properly so he could see the operation on the TV screen. That meant he was in 
danger of removing or damaging tissue he could not see, the board said. 
</P>
<P>
 During one such operation, on the left knee of a 36-year-old man at Simi 
Valley Hospital in 1991, Shirazi "was essentially lost," according to the board 
accusation. 
</P>
<P>
 The physician "had to be instructed or prompted on numerous occasions, as to 
where he was within the joint, and had a great deal of difficulty maneuvering 
the scope," the board said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirazi's work was monitored during the operation by a hospital-appointed 
proctor, Dr. H. William Frank, then chief of surgery at Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank, an orthopedist who has since left the hospital staff, said Shirazi's 
alleged ineptness "was kind of the straw that broke the camel's back," and 
prompted the hospital to suspend his surgical privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 "That particular problem was one of several problems that we couldn't allow to 
continue to happen," Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirazi denied he had any trouble with his instruments during the procedure. 
He blamed his problems with the medical board on Frank, whose report touched 
off the state investigation of Shirazi. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Frank, personally, he is against me," Shirazi said. "He believes he's 
God. It's as simple as that. What he's saying is exaggerated and his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been doing this procedure for more than 10 years," he said. "How come 
all of a sudden I don't know how to do it?"

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HILLS; GROUP PLANTS SEEDS OF VEGETARIANISM WITH TOFU 
TACOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you think a tofu-filled taco would be anathema to those fond of the 
traditional meat-filled staple, think again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very good," said Rosario Palomares, who had her first taste at a home 
cooking class sponsored by the Vegetarian Society. 
</P>
<P>
 In gatherings reminiscent of neighborhood Tupperware parties, the Vegetarian 
Society is attempting to deliver its meatless message to the Valley's Latino 
community. Although the society has staged food booths at Latino events in Los 
Angeles County for many years, it has only recently begun to host cooking 
classes in predominantly Latino communities. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the society held its first cooking class in a North Hills 
apartment complex where the majority of the residents are Mexican and 
Salvadoran. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight people showed up, said host Victor Forsythe, executive director of the 
group since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're reaching out to the most marginal sectors of the community here in the 
Valley to help them reduce their daily food cost and to better their 
nutrition," Forsythe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The classes, conducted in Spanish, teach participants how to make tacos and 
enchiladas using soy products as meat substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the meeting, several of the attendees told Forsythe that they had given 
up red meat and were showing their families the benefits of a vegetarian diet. 
</P>
<P>
 Forsythe kicked off his campaign last fall at the Granada Hills Branch Library 
with an hourlong slide presentation critical of the meat industry and a 
discussion of the history of vegetarianism. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Forsythe and volunteers are cooking vegetarian tacos in support of 
a march from Delano to Sacramento by members of the United Farm Workers union. 
UFW founder Cesar Chavez was a longtime member of the Vegetarian Society. 
"We're trying to tie into the struggle of that famous vegetarian," Forsythe 
said. TERESA ANN WILLIS

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; BANK'S $5,000 TO AID SCHOOL'S COMPUTERS

 Encino Elementary School, which was adopted by Citibank's Encino branch in 
September, will receive $5,000 from the bank to buy software for a planned 
renovation of its aging computer lab. 
</P>
<P>
 On its own, the school raised about $26,000 through the Parent-Teacher Assn. 
and by saving from the campus budget over the past several years.With those 
funds, the school will purchase 18 computers and two printers for its computer 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bank's donation was a welcome addition. Like many district schools, 
Encino Elementary is turning to the private sector to compensate for budget 
cuts over the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the wave of the future," said Encino Elementary Principal Orlando 
Martinez-Miller of the relationship between public schools and private 
companies. "We just don't have enough funds for everything we need." SUSAN

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; DEVELOPER SELECTED FOR SENIOR HOUSING

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Burbank has picked a developer to build 176 senior citizen 
apartments and retail space on a city-owned plot at 3rd Street and Magnolia 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting as the Redevelopment Agency, the City Council approved Cusumano 
Development Industries of Burbank as the developer in a 3-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The city must still work out an agreement under which the developer would 
acquire the land to be used for the project. The cost of the property will be 
based on a formula that considers the amount of low-income housing the project 
generates, said Steve Somers, project manager for the Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In other business, the City Council approved basic cable rate charges of 
$10.16 by Sammons Communications, whose franchise agreement with the city is up 
for renewal. However, the council objected to the cable company's hourly charge 
for service calls of $71.25 and ordered that the charge be cut to $22.35 per 
hour, which is closer to what the city's consultants have said is typically 
charged by cable companies across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Sammons, which has argued that its charges for service calls are fair when 
compared with what is asked by such service people as electricians and 
plumbers, has 30 days to appeal the decision to the Federal Communications 
Commission. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; AIRPORT PANEL WILL STUDY COPTER NOISE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Van Nuys Airport Citizens Advisory Council has decided to investigate 
claims by a homeowner activist that helicopter noise at the airport can be 
reduced by cutting down flights by media organizations and tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 The council on Tuesday night voted to ask representatives from the Federal 
Aviation Administration, the Los Angeles Department of Airports and the Los 
Angeles city attorney's office to come before the council to discuss a study by 
Gerald Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino, that purports to analyze 
helicopter traffic and noise.Silver told the organization that most helicopter 
noise comes from media and sightseeing flights, not emergency choppers. He 
recommended that flight patterns be changed and that news organizations be 
asked to pool footage from a single helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members, some expressing concern about acting on the 
recommendations of an amateur survey, voted 13 to 0 to conduct their own 
research. Member Doron Kauper abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have further technical debate by qualified people," member Clay 
Lacy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver's critics say that a desire to move helicopter routes away from his own 
home is behind the activist's lobbying, a charge that Silver denies. 
</P>
<P>
 Helicopter operators said they approved of the council's decision to refer the 
matter to professionals.  
</P>
<P>
 Rick Voorhis, owner of an airplane flight school based at the airport, said 
that one of Silver's suggested route changes is unsafe because it crosses the 
paths of jets that use Burbank Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody can put information into a computer and spit it out and make it say 
that it's unsafe to get into your car at night," Voorhis said. KAY HWANGBO

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has scheduled a community meeting in 
Pacoima on Saturday to discuss possible reductions in bus service and increases 
in fares to help close a severe budget shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting is one of eight community gatherings sponsored by the agency to 
inform residents of cost-cutting measures being studied.MTA officials have said 
that some bus fare and service changes will be unavoidable in the coming fiscal 
year, beginning July 1, if the agency is to eliminate a capital and operating 
deficit of nearly $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Transit planners are considering raising the basic fare from $1.10 to $1.50, 
scaling back weekend and holiday service, and cutting bus lines that duplicate 
rail routes. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents will be able to comment and ask questions at Saturday's meeting, but 
formal public input will be received only at a public hearing April 23 at the 
county Hall of Administration in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacoima meeting will run from 9 a.m. to 12 noon at the Boys & Girls Club 
of the San Fernando Valley, 11251 Glenoaks Blvd. HENRY CHU

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: MCKEON TO PUSH FOR SMALLER VA HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite recently announced plans to tear down the quake-damaged Sepulveda 
Veterans Administration hospital, Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa 
Clarita) will push for construction of a 50-bed mini-hospital on the site, a 
spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon, who represents the district in which the hospital is located, hopes to 
meet with VA Secretary Jesse Brown soon to urge that some in-patient capacity 
be retained after the 431-bed hospital is demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown announced last month that the VA will spend $115 million to tear down 
the hospital -- the centerpiece of the sprawling, 22-building VA medical center 
in North Hills -- and build a state-of-the-art outpatient care facility in its 
stead. 
</P>
<P>
 The VA frantically evacuated 331 patients from the medical center after the 
Northridge earthquake and transferred them to other VA facilities in West Los 
Angeles, Long Beach and Loma Linda. The temblor rendered the hospital 
uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement that the hospital would be torn down angered many San 
Fernando Valley area veterans who have long used the medical center, which also 
provides nursing-home, mental-health and substance-abuse services. Those 
facilities will remain despite the demolition of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon spokesman Armando Azarloza said McKeon met Tuesday with medical center 
Director Perry C. Norman and other local VA officials and that they suggested 
that a smaller hospital be built. 
</P>
<P>
 Azarloza said hospital officials said the facility would be a boon to veterans 
from the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys, who will have to drive another 15 
miles from North Hills to get medical treatment in West Los Angeles. In 
emergency cases, such a long drive might jeopardize veterans' health, Azarloza 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Azarloza said McKeon was also concerned whether the views of Norman and other 
local officials were adequately considered by VA decision-makers in Washington 
before the demolition announcement was made March 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman said she supports Brown's conversion plan, but added: "We are not 
opposed to some time in the future having an in-patient presence again." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that before Brown made his decision to tear down the hospital, local 
officials proposed several alternatives, including construction of a smaller 
hospital with 100 to 120 beds. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman said, however, that a hospital of 50 or 60 beds "isn't . . . 
economical." She also noted that even with the extra Sepulveda patients, the 
West Los Angeles hospital still has nearly 200 empty beds. JACK CHEEVERS

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; YOUTHS WASH CLOTHING FOR QUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>

 Thirty eager teen-agers, mostly untrained in the art of laundry, played a part 
in a dirty trick Wednesday to aid those displaced by the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
They took one ton of sooty sweaters, muddied jeans, soiled socks and 
dirt-encrusted shirts and washed them clean. 
</P>
<P>
 Using clothes donated by San Fernando Valley family-service organizations, the 
teen-agers from Eleanor J. Toll Middle School in Glendale first practiced their 
sorting skills, using one corner of the Clean King Laundromat. Having mastered 
the ability to separate the darks from the lights, they did their best to 
correctly execute the other laundry tasks -- with varying degrees of success. 
</P>
<P>
 After securing a washing machine and carting over a basket of dirty whites, 
14-year-old Mike Nazari tried to recall the brief laundry tutorial offered by 
one of the supervising adults a few minutes before the teen-agers were set 
loose.  
</P>
<P>
 He opened the lid, dumped in the clothes (mashing them down until they fit to 
his liking), tossed in the requisite cup of detergent and then slammed the lid 
down and pushed in the quarters with one fluid motion.  
</P>
<P>
 While Mike smiled at his own technique, one of the adults who had watched his 
endeavor rolled her eyes and called the group over for a review of laundry 
rules.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you put your detergent in after the clothes, the detergent is going to 
stick to your clothes," said Diane Kries, a representative from Surf laundry 
detergent, which sponsored the event. "Quarters first, water, detergent, wait 
two minutes, then the clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers, many of whom passed the time between cycles by seeing how far 
they could open the machines' lids without causing them to stop spinning, are 
participants in We Care for Youth, a social-service organization for at-risk 
children. The group agreed to spend a day of spring break volunteering for the 
wash-a-thon as a part of a community-service requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the wash-a-thon, after which the cleaned clothes will be 
distributed to several Valley community groups, Surf distributed 4,000 vouchers 
for a free wash and dry at various area Laundromats. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are families that have been displaced, that were living in very 
difficult situations before the earthquake," said Yoland Trevino, the director 
of the Vaughn Family Center in San Fernando. "Now they have 15 families in a 
household or living in cars because they have not received FEMA funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a lot of these families, being able to access these vouchers or clean 
clothes has been a lifesaver." ABIGAIL GOLDMAN

EX-DEPUTY PLEADS GUILTY TO STEALING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy has pleaded guilty to two counts 
of stealing money seized in narcotics arrests when he belonged to an elite unit 
that was disbanded in 1989, federal authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver Horeczky, 47, of Agoura Hills entered a guilty plea Monday before U. S. 
District Court Judge Harry L. Hupp, said Assistant U. S. Atty.Stefan Stein. He 
is the 22nd former deputy convicted under an investigation by the multi-agency 
Big Spender Task Force, Stein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Horeczky also pleaded guilty to one count of failing to declare the income on 
his 1989 tax return, Stein said. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the former deputies were attached to one of four Major Violator Crews, 
top-flight narcotics teams assembled during the 1980s, Stein said. Stein 
declined to say specifically how much money Horeczky took, but said that the 
former deputy's units stole tens of thousands of dollars in seized drug funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Horeczky faces a maximum prison sentence of 23 years and a fine of $750,000, 
Stein said. He will be sentenced in mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, former sheriff's deputies Robert Karl Clark, 45, of Glendora and 
Paul Rapisarda, 50, of La Palma pleaded guilty in cases stemming from the same 
investigation, Stein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark faces a maximum 20-year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine, and 
Rapisarda faces 23 years and a $750,000 fine, Stein said. Those deputies will 
be sentenced in late September and early October.

FUGITIVE IN MURDER CASE ARRIVES TO FACE CHARGES; CRIME: RICHARD LEOS, ACCUSED 
IN 1975 INCIDENT, WAIVES EXTRADITION FROM SEATTLE. HE IS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AT 
AIRPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a surprise move, fugitive Richard Leos waived extradition Wednesday and was 
flown from Seattle to Los Angeles to face murder charges in a Pacoima barroom 
slaying he allegedly committed 19 years ago before disappearing under a variety 
of fake identities. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving at Burbank Airport just after 5:30 p.m., Leos, handcuffed, was 
whisked through the airport and into a waiting police car to be held for 
arraignment, which could come as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
 Casually dressed in a turquoise shirt, Leos, 42, smiled broadly as he was led 
through airport passageways clogged with travelers. He said little, except that 
he was not the killer who authorities say blasted a man in the head with a 
shotgun in 1975 when the victim refused to cooperate with robbers in a Pacoima 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't do it," Leos said softly. "That's enough said." 
</P>
<P>
 Leos, also known as Jess or Jessie Caruso, waived extradition at a preliminary 
hearing before a judge in Seattle. Had he fought the request, it could have 
taken Los Angeles prosecutors as long as three months to get custody of Leos 
from Washington state authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really took us by surprise," said Detective Ray Broker, a homicide 
investigator in the LAPD Foothill Division, who attended the hearing. "He said 
there's no sense in fighting it. He said he wants to face the charges." 
</P>
<P>
 Leos was arrested last week by an interagency fugitive task force based in 
Washington state, after Los Angeles police determined that he was living in a 
Seattle suburb under a false identity, with a common-law wife and her two grown 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Leos faces charges of murder, armed robbery and unlawful flight to avoid 
prosecution. If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison without 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Broker, authorities said, who followed up a tip to end Leos' nearly two 
decades as a fugitive, under various aliases, in the United States and Mexico. 
Broker and Los Angeles Police Detective Rick Plows were at the preliminary 
hearing in Seattle on Wednesday as part of the LAPD's continuing investigation 
into the case, and they immediately took custody of him and flew back. 
</P>
<P>
 Broker said the detectives plan to fly back to the Seattle area to see if they 
can find information to bolster their case against him, and perhaps find the 
two alleged accomplices that authorities say were with Leos during the holdup. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say they can produce a witness who knew Leos and was in the bar 
when the shooting occurred, who can testify that Leos was the killer. 
</P>
<P>
 Leos' common-law wife said Wednesday that he has called her every day from 
jail, maintaining his innocence while declining to discuss with her specifics 
of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is innocent," said Ginger Rosendale. "They are going to have to prove 
everything. He's told me he doesn't know why they are taking him down." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosendale said Leos waived extradition so he can confront the charges against 
him in court. "He isn't fighting it," she said. "He is just getting on with it, 
to clear this thing up."

JUDGE CRITICIZED OVER 4-MONTH DELAY IN MURDERER'S SENTENCING; COURTS: FAMILY OF 
VALENCIA VICTIM SAYS JURIST DOESN'T WANT TO HAND DOWN DEATH PENALTY RECOMMENDED 
BY JURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five months ago, a jury decided that a prison parolee who abducted and 
murdered a Valencia man deserves to be put to death. 
</P>
<P>
 But 24-year-old Scott Forrest Collins is still in county jail, awaiting the 
formal sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 The family of Fred D. Rose, who was shot in the back of the head, believes 
there is one simple reason why Superior Court Judge Leon Kaplan hasn't sent 
Collins to Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he wants to sentence him to the death penalty," said Sharon 
Rose, wife of the slain construction supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say the four-month delay in this case is unusual, noting that 
actions by the judge, and not the defense attorney, have delayed the 
sentencing. The judge, who has never handled a death penalty case before, has 
requested that defense attorney Bruce Hill write memos concerning possibly 
inappropriate conduct during the trial by prosecutors and members of the court 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan's requests for additional paperwork have come during several hearings 
and were not solicited by the defense. In all, Kaplan has conducted six 
post-trial hearings which have delayed a sentencing originally scheduled for 
Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, (Kaplan) has no courage and he should not be sitting on the bench," 
Sharon Rose said. "He's not for preventing crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan declined to comment on the case, citing ethical rules which bar judges 
from commenting pending a case in their courts.  
</P>
<P>
 Collins is again scheduled to be sentenced today, but Kaplan must first rule 
on a request for a new trial, a motion filed in nearly every serious case. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors and members of the victim's family firmly believe Kaplan will 
order a new trial in Collins' case, this to avoid the difficult chore of 
sentencing someone to die. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very concerned that the judge will not in fact follow the jury's 
recommendation," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Lea Purwin D'Agostino, who added that 
jurors have contacted her to express "their dismay." 
</P>
<P>
 If Kaplan wants to retain his position on the bench, the Rose family has 
warned, he should hand down the death sentence. If not, he should prepare to 
suffer the wrath of victims advocacy groups who, according to Sharon Rose, will 
challenge him when he comes up for reelection and take the judge "on a roller 
coaster ride that will last (his) entire life." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins was found guilty of first-degree murder in the Jan. 23, 1992, 
execution-style slaying of Rose, a Valencia resident and father of three who 
was shot only one month after Collins was released from prison. The jury also 
convicted Collins on two special circumstance charges, murder during a robbery 
and a kidnaping, both of which made him eligible for the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The same panel that convicted Collins on Sept. 30 later determined that death 
was the appropriate punishment. The jury made its formal recommendation to 
Kaplan on Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Under California law, if a jury recommends death, the judge must act like a 
13th juror and independently weigh the evidence presented during the penalty 
phase. It is extremely rare for a judge to overlook the death recommendation 
and hand down the only other possible sentence in a special circumstance murder 
case -- life in prison without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on their observations, Rose family members feel Kaplan is acting as if 
he is the attorney who will represent Collins during the inevitable appeal. 
They point to Kaplan's three-day review of the nearly 7,000 pages of trial 
transcript, while in open court, and recommendations he made to defense 
attorney Hill about specific points to make during his motion for a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The constant delays have been widely discussed among prosecutors in the Van 
Nuys courthouse, many of whom believe Kaplan is looking for a way to avoid 
issuing an execution order. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a classic case of justice delayed," D'Agostino said. "Did the 
defendant wait five months until he killed the victim?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Collins' attorney made a motion for a new trial, a request 
initially based on action by the jury during deliberations. Two jurors used a 
protractor and string -- and what Hill characterizes as erroneous evidence -- 
to determine Collins shot Rose while the victim was on his knees. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hill first appeared to argue his motion, Kaplan raised other issues, 
pointing out that he observed D'Agostino and courtroom observers making 
inappropriate faces during the trial. After being "encouraged to brief those 
issues" by the judge, Hill was forced to amend his motion, or else face 
possible accusations of malpractice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is this type of behavior that has caused the public to lose faith in the 
criminal justice system," D'Agostino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Rose said she has been demoralized by the wait. "My heart is totally 
immobilized," she said. "It does affect how we get on with our lives."

AROUND THE VALLEY: ACTIVIST SHOWS SOUTH-CENTRAL AND VALLEY AREN'T MILES APART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The topic of a recent discussion in the San Fernando Valley sounded 
intriguing: "What's Happening in South-Central L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Would busloads of Bloods and Crips be there to describe gang warfare? Would 
drug dealers be there to describe the lure of a quick buck for undereducated 
teen-agers? 
</P>
<P>
 Would cops be warning of perilous streets? 
</P>
<P>
 No, none of them were there. Instead, a lone, veteran community activist was 
there with an equally intriguing, but simple message: "All the things you've 
heard about South-Central are not fact," said Lois Medlock, who has lived for 
more than 40 years in a bungalow near 49th Street and Avalon Boulevard in the 
South Park area. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Medlock told the monthly meeting of Seniors For Action, people in 
South-Central are very much like people in Encino or Sherman Oaks or Van Nuys: 
Decent folks who want government off their backs, bad politicians voted out of 
office and developers to leave their neighborhoods alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The similarities rather than the differences between South-Central and the 
Valley were one of the reasons that Belle Palmer, the program chairwoman, 
invited Medlock to speak to her group of political activists, which is 
officially nonpartisan although most members espouse liberal views. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had heard her speak at another function, and I thought she was a dynamic 
person," Palmer said. "Her community has similar issues to which we can relate 
even though we are separated by freeways." 
</P>
<P>
 As if to prove the point that people in the two communities are similar, just 
prior to the talk a moderator, who had been making announcements of coming 
events and recent political developments, asked whether Medlock had yet 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's sitting in the third row," someone yelled from among the three dozen or 
so Valley people in the audience at the Senior Center at the Van Nuys-Sherman 
Oaks Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief self-introduction, Medlock, a native of Louisiana who still has 
a Southern accent, quickly hit a familiar chord when she criticized the 
Community Redevelopment Agency, which she described as one of her pet peeves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The CRA is not there to make the land prettier, it's there to shove you off 
your land," she said as several people in the audience nodded in agreement. 
"I'm tired of it. Everything is becoming concrete." 
</P>
<P>
 Medlock said that like some Valley residents, she, too, has had to fight to 
save her neighborhood from proposed freeway and rail lines and large 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think we've all moved to Baldwin Hills," she said, referring to the 
African American middle-class community in the Westside. "They plan to take 
South-Central." 
</P>
<P>
 But she suggested that a coming together of all people and communities could 
repel such efforts in both South-Central and the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must come together as human beings, and together make things happen," she 
implored. "If we don't hang together, we're going to hang separately." 
</P>
<P>
 There were times, though, when it became clear that hanging together does not 
necessarily mean sharing all the same opinions; when it became clear that 
Medlock saw some issues entirely differently from her Valley audience. 
</P>
<P>
 When a man in the audience suggested that children in South-Central should be 
bused to schools in the Valley to get a better education, she snapped back: 
"Instead of busing the children out of the area, just bring the materials in 
and they'll learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Another audience member asked about the proliferation of liquor stores in 
South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "Liquor built this country," she retorted, adding that she is a teetotaler. 
The major supermarkets "don't want all those liquor stores because they compete 
against them. They're not helping me, but some of them are black-owned 
businesses and that's good." 
</P>
<P>
 When another member of the audience asked her what she thought of LAPD Deputy 
Chief Mark Kroeker, the popular former Valley bureau chief who now heads the 
South bureau, which includes South-Central, Medlock replied: "Who? I'm not 
impressed with the police. I don't like gun smoke for breakfast." 
</P>
<P>
 "The man is a saint," someone in the back of the room muttered. 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging that there is crime in her neighborhood, she added, "If 
someone wants to snatch my purse, he doesn't have to be black. 
</P>
<P>
 "The black man is accused of being everything but what he really is: a member 
of this society," she said. "The scales of justice have to be balanced." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Medlock didn't mince words when it came to criticizing African American 
community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council representatives from her area, Rita Walters and Mark 
Ridley-Thomas, are "the worst people on the City Council. . . . All politicians 
lie, but they don't have to lie all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 And as for African American celebrities who lend their names and time to help 
rebuild South-Central, Medlock said, "They go to Cecil Murray's church and stop 
right there." Murray is pastor of the First AME Church, a socially and 
politically active church in South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Medlock, like community activists in the Valley, fiercely defends her 
neighborhood because she loves it. "It's the most beautiful part of the city," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 But she traveled up two or three freeways to meet with her contemporaries in 
the Valley because she knows that preserving one's back yard is going to take 
more than just your next-door neighbor's help; it's going to take the help of 
your neighbor across the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 And one way to get that help is to show up in your across-the-freeway 
neighbor's yard and show them that you are much like they are. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to be afraid of me, because I'm not afraid of you," Medlock 
said.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: COALITION PRAISED FOR GANG PEACE WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of gangsters and religious leaders was recognized Wednesday for 
dramatically reducing gang violence in the San Fernando Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon praised members of Valley United 
Peace Treaty for their so-far successful effort to achieve peace among 75 
Latino gangs.Since the truce began last Halloween, there have been only six 
gang-related slayings, none of them involving Latino gangs, police said. That 
is a 70% reduction from the 20 gang-related homicides during the same period 
the year before, said Lt. Joe Germain, Valley coordinator of the Los Angeles 
Police Department's anti-gang unit.  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't like to commend citizens for merely following the law, but we're 
supportive of this effort to reduce violence," said Deputy Chief Martin 
Pomeroy, the Valley's top police official.  
</P>
<P>
 "And we're cautiously optimistic that the truce will hold." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressure from a prison gang known as the Mexican Mafia sparked the peace 
treaty among Latino gangs, including those in the Valley. But non-gang members 
have joined the crusade, including members of a Christian group called Victory 
Outreach and William (Blinky) Rodriguez, a Van Nuys businessman whose son was 
killed in 1990 by gang members. The group holds weekly meetings and operates a 
hot line to defuse gang tensions, Rodriguez said. TRACEY KAPLAN

POLICE ARREST SUSPECT IN 20 ROBBERIES AFTER CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Sun Valley man suspected of robbing as many as 20 local minimarkets and 
liquor stores at gunpoint during the past two weeks was arrested Wednesday 
after a high-speed chase that left one Los Angeles Police Department officer 
slightly injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Deleon Oatis Jr., 21, led Los Angeles and Burbank police on a 16-minute 
pursuit at speeds of up to 70 m.p.h. through Sun Valley, North Hollywood, San 
Fernando and Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase began when Burbank police attempted to arrest Oatis at his home as a 
suspect in the 9 a.m. robbery of the Quick One food store at 2021 N. Hollywood 
Way in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 A robbery witness had identified a man matching Oatis' description as being 
the one who had walked into the store brandishing a shotgun and demanding the 
store's cash, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The witness told police that he later saw the man get into his car and was 
able to get the license number. Matching the number to Oatis' address, Burbank 
police were waiting for him when he returned home. 
</P>
<P>
 When they tried to take him into custody, Oatis fled and Los Angeles police 
joined the chase. 
</P>
<P>
 Oatis finally surrendered peacefully after his car collided with two police 
cars at the intersection of Paxton Street and Van Nuys Boulevard in Pacoima. 
One vehicle was an LAPD car driven by Foothill Division Officer Ernest Munoz 
and an unmarked car belonging to Burbank police. 
</P>
<P>
 Munoz was treated for bruises to one arm at nearby Holy Cross Medical Center 
and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they think that another suspect may also have been involved in the 
recent spate of armed robberies in the San Fernando Valley area.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; TENANTS FOR LANCASTER OUTLET MALL ANNOUNCED; 
RETAIL: APPAREL MAKERS TENTATIVELY AGREE TO LEASE STORES AT SITE SET TO OPEN IN 
THE FALL. CITY IS BANKING ON NEW SALES TAX REVENUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Brooks Brothers, Bass, Carole Little, Jockey and Jones New York are among the 
nationally known apparel makers that have tentatively agreed to lease stores in 
a new factory outlet mall expected to open here this fall, city officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster City Council members said they are banking on the 24-acre mall to 
generate millions of dollars in sales tax revenue that can be used to pay for 
critical city services, including law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a tremendous asset to the community," said Councilman George 
Root. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials also said the outlet center will sell shoes and clothing that 
are not available elsewhere in Lancaster.  
</P>
<P>
 They said the city has been losing sales tax dollars because local residents 
have been shopping in Palmdale, where the Antelope Valley Mall is located, or 
at stores in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is going to fill a void that we needed to fill in the city of 
Lancaster," Mayor Arnie Rodio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yehuda Netanel, president of Woodland Hills-based California Factory Stores, 
said he hopes to break ground within 45 days and begin turning over the stores 
to the merchants by Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Many outlets will be open by Thanksgiving, the traditional start of the 
holiday shopping season, Netanel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other clothing makers that have leased spaced or made commitments to move into 
the mall are Oshkosh, Jones New York, JH Collectibles, Van Heusen and Geoffrey 
Beene, Netanel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The outlet mall, made up of about 65 stores, will be built on the north side 
of Lancaster Boulevard, just west of the Antelope Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Netanel said he expects it to attract shoppers from throughout Southern 
California, including travelers bound for ski areas and vacation spots in 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At factory outlet centers, merchants generally sell overstocked, discontinued 
and slightly flawed goods, as well as first-quality items, at discount prices. 
Councilman Frank Roberts said the prices are lower partly because outlet 
centers are less expensive to operate than traditional enclosed shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster's outlet mall tenants were announced less than a week before three 
of the five City Council members will compete against 10 challengers in a bid 
for reelection. Many of the challengers have criticized incumbents Rodio, Root 
and the Rev. Henry Hearns for approving financial incentives to lure the outlet 
mall and other large retailers to town. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24-acre site where the mall will be built was owned by the city's 
redevelopment agency. The agency made a 20-year loan to Netanel's company to 
allow it to buy the land for $2.27 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency also made a separate $555,000 "pre-development loan" and agreed to 
pay more than $700,000 in fees the city charges to developers. Also, the agency 
agreed to build a new road alongside the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, the mall is expected to create 340 new jobs and produce $19.5 
million in sales tax revenue for the city over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics have complained that the incentives were too high and that the 
outlet stores will force existing merchants out of business. But council 
members have said that the city needs to boost its sales tax revenue to 
maintain local services without raising taxes.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; EARLY WARNING; SCHOOLS: UNLOADED GUN FOUND IN 
A LOCKER HELPS PROMPT RURAL CASTAIC DISTRICT TO BUY A METAL DETECTOR. STUDENTS 
NOW UNDERGO RANDOM SEARCHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When an unloaded gun was found in a student locker at Castaic Middle School 
more than a year ago, parents in this small community were concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, a 15-year-old Reseda High School student shot a 17-year-old 
point-blank in a hallway during midmorning break. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the incidents illustrated big city violence creeping into outlying 
areas. The Castaic Union School District responded by purchasing a metal 
detector -- becoming the first small, non-urban school district in California 
to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the $130 hand-held device came random weekly searches of students, 
their backpacks and lockers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we thought our campus was safe, we wanted to do something more," 
said Beverly Silsbee, principal of Castaic Middle School. "I don't know that we 
did it to find anything. We did it as one more thing to make people feel safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite initial concerns about privacy and class disruptions, district 
officials said the searches are now seen merely as an another effort to promote 
campus safety. There have been no parental complaints, Silsbee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Silsbee conducts the random searches with the assistance of dean Chuck Habert. 
They are conducted once a week at a different time, day and location, to check 
a cross-section of the campus' 500 students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think kids, for the most part, appreciate it can be done at any time and 
any place," Silsbee said. 
</P>
<P>
 The checks have resulted in half a dozen suspensions. Some students were found 
carrying pocket knives. Others had large poster markers often used for 
graffiti. One student was suspended for having a large wad of money, more than 
$100, to buy items from other students, in violation of campus policy. 
</P>
<P>
 No guns have been found. 
</P>
<P>
 Each search takes about five minutes and includes use of the hand-held metal 
detector and a visual check of the student and possessions such as book bags. 
Silsbee and Habert usually enter a class and randomly choose every third, 
fourth or fifth pupil to be examined. 
</P>
<P>
 Students have the option to decline a search and contact their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have found more interesting stuff in backpacks. "We've found week-old 
lunches. We've found toys," Silsbee said. "More often it's the boys that are on 
the disorganized side." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials plan to continue the random searches and may purchase a 
second metal detector once enrollment expands.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SWASTIKA PAINTING MARKS 2ND HATE INCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 10-foot-tall swastika painted in ketchup on a Canyon Country driveway Easter 
Sunday was the second hate incident in the city in less than two weeks, 
authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Racist flyers were discovered in student lockers at Placerita Junior High 
School in Newhall 13 days earlier. But Los Angeles County sheriff's 
investigators believe that the swastika and flyers came from different sources. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would really be a surprise if they're related," said Sgt. Howard Fairchild 
of the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station. "It (the swastika) is not the 
m.o. of the other knuckleheads." 
</P>
<P>
 Two men -- one Latino and one African American -- live in the home on Basel 
Street where the swastika was painted. Authorities believe that the drawing was 
probably a nasty prank aimed at the two men specifically, rather than the 
handiwork of neo-Nazis trying to spread the racist sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar Nazi-type graffiti appears about two or three times a year in Santa 
Clarita, Fairchild said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the thing with the flyers are people from out of the area trying to 
spread a message here," Fairchild said. "I hope this (the ketchup swastika) is 
just one incident that's not going to be repeated." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 leaflets bearing derogatory remarks about Latinos and Jews 
were found at Placerita Junior High March 21, making the incident the largest 
distribution of hate literature in northern Los Angeles County in memory. 
School officials used the incident to begin discussions about cultural 
diversity, racism and tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 A smaller batch of anti-Latino flyers -- about a dozen -- was discovered in 
soda packs, backpacks and women's hygiene products at several Santa Clarita 
grocery stores in December. 
</P>
<P>
 In both incidents involving the printed materials, the leaflets gave a phone 
number for the White Aryan Resistance group in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say hate flyers are protected by the First Amendment, and those 
responsible for distributing them on school campuses or in a store could only 
be charged with trespassing.

HUD GIVES $4.6-MILLION RELIEF GRANT TO SANTA CLARITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 This city will receive the fourth-largest earthquake recovery grant given by 
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to municipalities hammered 
by the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The $4.6-million HUD grant can be used to repair quake damage not paid for by 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Small Business Administration or 
similar government funding sources. Roads, housing and community programs are 
eligible for the revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't want dual funding of projects, (but) this money was given to deal 
with earthquake-related damage to the city," said Vyto Adomaitis, head of the 
city's federal Community Development Block Grant program. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA provides assistance to homeowners and renters and, through its public 
assistance program, funds repairs of schools, sewers, hospitals and municipal 
facilities such as Santa Clarita's damaged City Hall building. The SBA offers 
low-interest loans to residents and merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 The three larger HUD recovery grants were $99 million to Los Angeles; $7.9 
million to Los Angeles County; and $5.5 million to Simi Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 All grants are part of the $9.1 billion in federal earthquake relief funds 
approved earlier this year by Congress and President Clinton, Adomaitis said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials requested federal assistance after the 6.8-magnitude quake, 
which caused about $244.4 million in damage to the Santa Clarita Valley, but 
did not ask for a predetermined amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be a process to identify which projects and areas we want to spend 
this on," Adomaitis said. "We didn't apply for anything specifically." 
</P>
<P>
 Those projects will be reviewed by the City Council and forwarded to HUD. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great we are able to work on housing and use this money to help 
people who have had personal tragedies," said Santa Clarita Mayor George 
Pederson. 
</P>
<P>
 Pederson credited the large grant awarded to efforts by city employees, both 
during the application process and in general, for reminding agencies that many 
cities outside Northridge were damaged by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did our homework," said Pederson. "We let it be known that we had suffered 
some damage and we needed some help. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a tendency to concentrate on harder hit sites with more damage. 
Sometimes, some of us get left out. This time, that didn't happen."

COLOR THIS YEAR'S ARTS FESTIVAL DIVERSE; UK / LA FESTIVAL 1994 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as Los Angeles is a different city than it was in 1988, so will the 
second UK/LA Festival present a different United Kingdom than was shown in the 
first UK/LA festival in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 UK/LA 1994, a citywide arts fest, will be officially announced today by Prince 
Andrew, Duke of York, at a reception at the Hancock Park home of British Consul 
Merrick Baker-Bates. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled to begin Sept. 7 and run through November, the festival has not been 
finalized, but some of the confirmed offerings include a celebration of the 
25th anniversary of Monty Python; the West Coast debut of the urban percussion 
group Stomp; a tribute to the British film industry; the Halle Orchestra of 
Manchester; the United States premiere by the Royal National Theatre of David 
Hare's play "Racing Demon" and the Royal Shakespeare Company in "Henry VI, Part 
3." The Los Angeles Opera will present Handel's "Xerxes" and Long Beach Opera 
will present a double bill of works by Vaughn Williams and Henry Purcell. 
</P>
<P>
 Visual arts presentations will range from the first retrospective of 
contemporary artist R. B. Kitaj at the Los Angeles County Museum and an 
exhibition of William Blake's illustrations and books at the Huntington 
Library. 
</P>
<P>
 While the 1988 festival focused mostly on mainstream presentations, festival 
executive director Bruce Joseph said that the 1994 festival will also attempt 
to update the perception of British arts by blending cutting-edge British 
artists with more traditional offerings, reflecting a heightened awareness of 
the growing multiethnic character of the United Kingdom, which they believe 
parallels that of Los Angeles. For example, the British women's a cappella 
group "Black Voices," will be featured, as well as community outreach and 
educational programs, such as an exchange between East L.A.'s Self-Help 
Graphics and young artists of Glasgow. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Baker-Bates said that early discussions about bringing UK/LA back to Los 
Angeles in 1994 were held with then-Mayor Tom Bradley not long after the Los 
Angeles riots. He said that the city's post-riot awareness of ethnic issues and 
urban concerns reflected those of Prince Charles, who will visit Los Angeles 
during the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a child, Britain was a purely white society; over the last 30 
years, our society has been transformed, very, very fast, into a multiethnic 
society," Baker-Bates said in an interview earlier this week. "We felt very 
strongly that what we wanted to show was the multiethnic nature of Britain." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker-Bates added that, "One of the things I want people to feel here is, this 
is a bit of a tonic for Los Angeles -- that someone is interested in the place, 
that it isn't all gloom and doom." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker-Bates acknowledged that the festival will reflect not only a social 
interest, but also an economic interest in Los Angeles as well. "There is a 
great deal of Southern California investment in the United Kingdom . . . and 
equally, there is a lot of British investment in this part of the world -- $9 
billion of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is also a tremendous artistic link between the two countries as well. 
We have literally thousands of British people working in Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The $7.2-million 1988 festival was three months long; the 1994 festival will 
be two months long, with a scaled-down budget of approximately $5 million. Like 
the 1988 festival, the 1994 fest represents a blend of British arts events 
already planned and financed by various arts organizations around town, as well 
as productions sponsored and co-sponsored by UK/LA. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Blachly, director of the UCLA Center for the Performing Arts -- which 
will host Stomp -- said that Stomp's performances were planned in advance of 
UK/LA, but the festival will co-sponsor other performances at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1988 festival was highlighted by a David Hockney retrospective at the Los 
Angeles Contemporary Museum of Art (LACMA) -- an already-scheduled event that 
conveniently fit under the UK/LA banner. 
</P>
<P>
 LACMA spokeswoman Jessica O'Dwyer said that the museum is pleased to have 
previously-scheduled events such as the Kitaj exhibit fall under the festival's 
auspices. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth, it helps us to get the word out," she said.

SUMMER MOVIE HYPE COMING IN LIKE A 'LION'; DISNEY OPENS SEASON WITH APRIL 
TICKET SALES FOR A JUNE RELEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a move unprecedented in modern movie history, Disney will begin selling 
tickets to its animated feature "The Lion King" this Sunday -- more than two 
months before the film's exclusive June 15 openings at Hollywood's El Capitan 
Theater and New York's Radio City Music Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, in a further effort to get a jump on the fiercely competitive 
summer moviegoing season, Disney has already begun screening the movie for film 
buyers in major markets around the country to try to ensure bookings in the 
best theaters. In hyping "The Lion King" this early, Disney is looking to ride 
the wave of enthusiasm that 30 minutes of clips from the movie generated at 
last month's ShoWest exhibitors' convention in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry watchers are predicting that Disney's 32nd full-length animated 
feature could be the biggest movie of the summer and that it could easily gross 
$200 million or more eventually in domestic markets alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Lion King" features cutting-edge animation from Disney, five new songs by 
Elton John and Oscar-winning lyricist Tim Rice ("Aladdin") and the voices of 
Jeremy Irons, Matthew Broderick, James Earl Jones, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech 
Marin and Robert Guillaume. It's an allegorical tale of a young lion cub on a 
heroic journey to claim his destined role as king of the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be gigantic," predicts Barry Reardon, president of distribution at 
Warner Bros., one of Disney's biggest competitors. Warner's will open one of 
its own most anticipated summer movies, "Wyatt Earp," starring Kevin Costner, 
on June 24 -- the day "Lion King" will expand its run to about 2,000 theaters 
nationwide.  
</P>
<P>
 Reardon, who next week will begin showing exhibitors Warner's other big summer 
Western -- "Maverick," starring Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster, which opens May 20 
-- says the long lead time for pre-selling tickets and screening "Lion King" is 
"unusual" but that he can understand it "because they obviously believe they 
have a great movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's distribution chief, Richard Cook, says that getting an early jump on 
ticket sales "enables us to set the movie up as a real special, unique summer 
event." He added that "Lion King" is "a movie that doesn't come along very 
often." 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket prices for the El Capitan and Radio City debut runs -- $10 for adults, 
$6 for children and senior citizens -- include a 20-minute live stage show 
before each screening that will feature music performed by Disney "characters" 
from movies such as "Snow White," "Cinderella," "Pinocchio," "Beauty and the 
Beast," "The Little Mermaid" and "Aladdin." The El Capitan show will run 
through July 14. The live show at Radio City, which will be performed by the 
Rockettes, will run through June 23. 
</P>
<P>
 In another break from convention, tickets for the El Capitan shows will be 
mailed to people who call an 800 phone number set up for the advance sales. 
Normally, tickets ordered through such services must be picked up at the 
theater on the day of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it has become more common now for tickets for "event-like" movies to 
be available weeks in advance, it is unheard of for sales to begin more than 
two months early. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is rare but entirely appropriate for a picture of this scope that is 
getting such wide acceptance," says John Krier, president of Exhibitor 
Relations Co., which tracks box-office performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely unusual," says Warner's Reardon, who notes, "it reminds me of 
the old roadshows." 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid- to late 1920s, advance ticket sales became very popular for what 
were called roadshow pictures -- big-event movies that were exhibited at select 
prestigious theaters usually on a reserved-seat basis and at premium admission 
prices. Roadshow productions in the '20s included King Vidor's 1925 "The Big 
Parade" and Fred Niblo's 1926 "Ben-Hur."  
</P>
<P>
 Roadshow movies averaged 10 performances a week, usually two shows a day, and 
tickets for them were often sold weeks, even months in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Advance tickets were sold for "Gone With the Wind" in 1939, but these were for 
designated performances, much as with "The Lion King," rather than for 
designated seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in 1956, recalled Krier, who once worked as an exhibitor in the Midwest, 
the assigned-seat tickets came back into vogue with Cecil B. DeMille's sound 
version of "The Ten Commandments" and continued through the late '50s and '60s 
with such pictures as "Around the World in 80 Days," "South Pacific," 
"Spartacus," "Can-Can," "El Cid," "The Guns of Navarone," "Lawrence of Arabia," 
"Oliver!" "The Longest Day" and "The Sound of Music."

three programs, Aug. 30-Sept. 1. And the Detroit Symphony, under its music 
director, Neeme Jarvi, will give three performances, Aug. 23-25. 
</P>
<P>
 American conductor Andrew Litton leads the season-opener, July 5, when Yefim 
Bronfman will be piano soloist. That program lists music by Berlioz, Beethoven 
and Rachmaninoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides those already named, conductors during the summer include Larry Baird, 
Matthias Bamert, George Daugherty, Carlo Rizzi, Gerard Schwarz (who leads two 
preseason concerts) and John Williams. 
</P>
<P>

Ray Charles, Rosemary Clooney, Jane Eaglen, Craig Estep, Wilhelmenia Fernandez, 
Chaka Khan, Ute Lemper, Patti LuPone, Lou Rawls, Curtis Rayam, Lisa Saffer and

Joe Pass Quartet, harmonica virtuoso Toots Thielemans, soul singer Etta James 
with the Roots Band, saxophonists Grover Washington Jr. and Sonny Rollins, and 
trumpeter Arturo Sandoval. 
</P>

 In a ceremony preceding the press conference, a 13,700-square-foot area for 
lawn picnics, which is promised to accommodate 1,800 people, was dedicated. The 
new picnic venue is a recent addition to the L.A. County-owned Bowl grounds, 
and is located adjacent to Highland Avenue, south of the amphitheater.

'704 HAUSER' BRACES FOR RACE ISSUE; TELEVISION: NORMAN LEAR'S LATEST SITCOM, 
FROM ARCHIE BUNKER'S OLD HOUSE, MAY RUFFLE FEATHERS WHEN IT DEBUTS ON CBS NEXT 
WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In Norman Lear's new series "704 Hauser," the punch lines come fast and 
furious, and the studio audience sounds as if it's having a rollicking good 
time roaring at the antics of the combative Cumberbatch family. 
</P>
<P>
 The show even has a comic pedigree: The title address is the same house where 
Archie Bunker fought son-in-law Meathead during the 1970s on Lear's "All in the 
Family." 
</P>
<P>
 But many African Americans who tune in may find their funny bones rubbed in 
the wrong direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the people associated with "704 Hauser" predict that black viewers 
might be less than pleased with the political views expressed by one of the 
main characters -- an ultraconservative who disdains liberals, believes blacks 
are too promiscuous, claims black people blame too much of their problems on 
white people, and proclaims that the black church focuses too much on 
victimization and injustice rather than on motivation and self-empowerment. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and the character espousing the views is black: Thurgood Marshall (Goodie) 
Cumberbatch (portrayed by T. E. Russell), a college student who lives at home 
with his liberal parents. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the flip side of Rob Reiner's Meathead character in "All in the Family," 
constantly arguing with his blue-collar father, Ernie Cumberbatch (John Amos), 
over his political views and his relationship with his idealistic white Jewish 
girlfriend, Cherlyn Markowitz (Maura Tierney). Trying to hold the family 
together, even though she also disapproves of her son's interracial 
relationship, is Rose Cumberbatch (Lynnie Godfrey), a caterer with strong 
church ties. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the show's key behind-the-scenes players and one of the models for 
Goodie says it will suit him just fine if the character angers black viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black people need to be made mad," said Armstrong Williams, a prominent 
African American conservative who is a creative consultant on "704 Hauser," 
which premieres Monday on CBS. With Williams, Spike Lee's motto, "Do the right 
thing," takes on a whole different flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth always hurts," Williams said by telephone from Washington, where he 
hosts a twice-weekly radio show, "The Right Side With Armstrong Williams." 
</P>
<P>
 "Black people need to be made uncomfortable. This show never forgets it's a 
comedy, but it also looks at how black people can complain about their 
problems. There's too much focus on victimization and 'blame whitey,' and not 
enough focus on helping ourselves and self-motivation." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams and producer Lear say that while Goodie may initially provoke black 
viewers, he ultimately will be accepted and admired by the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Goodie has something to believe in and he stands by it," said Williams, who 
also writes columns for USA Today and the Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He believes in abstaining from sex. He doesn't smoke or drink. He doesn't see 
himself as a victim. Even though some of his belief system is not fully 
developed yet because of his youth, I think it is Goodie's ideas that will move 
black people forward. Most Americans in the long run will identify more with 
him than with his father." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams and Lear may look, at first glance, to be strange bedfellows to 
collaborate on a series. Lear is one of the more prominent liberals in the 
entertainment industry, lending his name to numerous causes. But both men said 
they truly respect each other's views, and that all the characters in the show 
-- liberal and conservative -- come across as strong and truthful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly a lot of this will anger some people, but I don't think folks will 
turn it off," Lear said. " 'All in the Family' got people mad too, but they 
were interested in engaging in debate." 
</P>
<P>
 Russell, who plays Goodie, said he did not have difficulty relating to the 
character even though he is not affiliated with any particular party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Goodie just wants what's best for African Americans, and I agree with him on 
that," the 23-year-old actor said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Russell does part from his character in one major respect -- he is not a 
member of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' fan club. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't know what that brother's problem is," Russell said. "Sometimes 
I wonder what country he's grown up in. I don't know about his decisions. But 
Goodie really looks up to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his identification with Goodie, even Williams has trouble with aspects 
of the character -- particularly his white girlfriend and his shaved head, a 
style that is not considered typical for young black conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really not so high on him having a white girlfriend," Williams said. "My 
parents had a problem with interracial dating, and even though it's the wrong 
way to think, it's deeply embedded in me." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, he said he understood Lear's reasoning that a white girlfriend 
would provide even more potential for conflict in the household. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams would also prefer that Goodie had a conservative haircut rather than 
no hair at all. "A lot of us have a problem with that. But, hey, nothing is 
ever going to be perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 Russell said he shaved his head as a concession to Lear and network executives 
who felt his receding hairline made him look too old for the part. "Goodie is 
just a regular brother who doesn't come in any prescribed package," the actor 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what the public perception of "704 Hauser" ends up, Williams 
believes the show is a step forward from images presented on television shows 
such as "Martin" or "In Living Color." 
</P>
<P>
 "Those shows have no redeeming social values," Williams said. "I hope parents 
sit down with their kids to watch our show. They can point to Goodie and say, 
'Kids, you have a new role model.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * "704 Hauser" premieres Monday at 8:30 p.m. on CBS (Channels 2 and 8).

film; "Reboot," a computerized series about a living personal computer, and 
"Bump in the Night," a clay animation and puppetry program about toys that come 
to life when children aren't looking. A fourth series, "Fudge," based on the 
children's book by Judy Blume and produced by Steven Spielberg's Amblin 
Entertainment, will debut in January. The first of the "Saturday Morning 
Matinee" film series, an animated, musical adaptation of Frances Hodgson 
Burnett's "The Secret Garden," will air Nov. 5. . . . At rival network CBS, 
four new series, including "Disney's Aladdin" and "Beethoven," both half-hour 
animated versions of the box-office hits, will join the Saturday-morning lineup 
this fall. Other new additions are "Skeleton Warriors," a high-tech animated 
fantasy show, and "WILDC.A.T.S.," based on a best-selling comic book about two 
alien races fighting to rule planet Earth.

Forever," a prime-time special airing on ABC May 18. Walters offers a 
"shocking" report on what appears to be the end of the road for the venerable 
"Sesame Street" when greedy real-estate tycoon Ronald Grump (played by Joe 
Pesci) plans to demolish the quaint street to build a luxury complex. Julia 
Louis-Dreyfus, Rhea Perlman, Danny DeVito, John Goodman, Rosie O'Donnell and

 Snipes Cited in Florida Chase: Actor Wesley Snipes, who was recently placed on 
unsupervised probation in Los Angeles after pleading no contest to carrying a 
loaded weapon, has had another run-in with the law. The actor was cited for 
reckless driving after a 120-m.p.h. police chase in Jupiter, Fla., that ended 
with Snipes being thrown from his motorcycle when it was bumped by a patrol 
car, authorities said. The actor wasn't seriously hurt and refused medical 
treatment at the scene. Police said that Snipes threw something on the road 
during Monday night's chase, which lasted for 30 miles. A package of marijuana 
was later found near the site, but no drug charges were immediately filed. A 
spokesman for the actor, who was in Florida filming the movie, "Drop Zone," 
said that Snipes, 31, was speeding but not trying to elude police. "Contrary to 
rumors of an intentional high-speed chase, Snipes was unaware of the patrol car 
trailing him," the spokesman said.

 * 'Casablanca' Redux: A Hollywood sequel is in the works to the 1942 film 
classic "Casablanca." Warner Books, the Time Warner subsidiary that published 
"Scarlett," the 1991 "Gone With the Wind" sequel currently being produced as a 
TV movie, has hired authors Gerald Petievich and Gabrielle Humphreys to write 
what's currently titled "Casablanca, the Sequel." Daily Variety columnist Army

 MOCA to Reopen TC: Two years after closing its popular Temporary Contemporary

substitute for campus facilities damaged during the Northridge earthquake. MOCA 
Art Auction '94, the museum's biennial fund-raiser, will take place at the TC 
on June 3, with the works to be auctioned on public view at the space May 
21-June 2. Next year, "Action Occupation," a series of shows by Elizabeth Streb 
and her company, Ringside, will inaugurate the TC's performance programming 
Feb. 22-March 4. The space's first major exhibition, an examination of 
conceptual art called "1965-1975: Reconsidering the Object of Art," is slated 
to open May 7, 1995.

A NEW SONG AND DANCE FOR THE COWBOY JUNKIES; MUSIC: THE GROUP'S 'PALE SUN, 
CRESCENT MOON' TAKES A MORE AGGRESSIVE APPROACH THAN THE ALBUMS THAT GAVE THE 
BAND ITS SIGNATURE HUSHED SOUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When they toured in 1989, riding the success of their breakthrough album, "The 
Trinity Session," Cowboy Junkies were hawking souvenir T-shirts that would have 
warmed a librarian's heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shhhhh," read the T-shirt slogan, which couldn't have been more appropriate 
to the Toronto rock band's internalized, ruminative take on its country, folk 
and blues influences. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years later, though, the band is announcing itself with a clannng -- 
which is more or less the sound of the thick power chords that open its latest 
album, "Pale Sun, Crescent Moon." 
</P>
<P>
 By the album's end, Margo Timmins, the singer known for her preternatural 
hush, can be heard declaring herself with assertive bite:  
</P>
<P>
 It's a (expletive) ole world, but this ole girl, well she ain't giving in.  
</P>
<P>
 While it hasn't exactly turned into a hard-rock band (the closely-drawn, 
highly literate, mood-conscious internal monologue remains the signature of the 
band's style), those aggressive opening and closing moments do signal a desire 
to avoid being typecast as that whispering band that found success by recording 
in an echoing church. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this album, we definitely wanted to bring up the volume a bit," says 
guitarist Michael Timmins, Margo's older brother and, as songwriter and 
producer, the leading architect of the band's sound. "We've been moving away 
from the 'Trinity Session' feel for a while. With every record, we've tried to 
add a different element. The idea of a power chord opening (for the new album) 
was a conscious thought." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Michael said his sister has had a tougher time singing some of his more 
demanding compositions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ones she has the easiest time on are the straight love songs," he says. 
"Temperament wise, she's very mild and mellow, and she'd prefer to sing 
ballads. If somebody would let her, she'd sing ballads all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Michael has presented Margo with songs like "Hunted" and "Floorboard 
Blues," the concluding tracks that give the current album an eerie twist. Most 
of the songs on "Pale Sun, Crescent Moon" are evocative snapshots of 
relationships in jeopardy. But the characters in the two final songs are women 
who fear they are being stalked by rapists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Margo has to stretch herself a bit," he points out. "Usually, she ends up 
giving the most interesting performances (on) the ones she has to work hardest 
on to find the character -- to find her way into the song." 
</P>
<P>
 The creative process can get testy for rock bands -- like the Who and the Band 
in their heyday -- that have one member writing the songs and another singing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael notes that some assume working relationships would be even more 
explosive within Cowboy Junkies, where sibling rivalries are added to the usual 
tinder that sets off internal flare-ups (besides Michael, 35, and Margo, 33, 
the core lineup includes younger brother Peter Timmins, 28, on drums, and 
bassist Alan Anton). 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, he notes, the band has enjoyed a relatively unruffled nine-year 
existence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been at it as long as the Who and the Band were," he says. "But I 
think in our case, the brother and sister relationship makes it less (tense) 
because we understand each other very well. Our personalities don't seem to 
conflict. We all have our roles and like what we do, and give each other enough 
space." 
</P>
<P>
 * Cowboy Junkies and Freedy Johnston play Saturday and Sunday at 7 p.m. and 
9:30 p.m. at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. All

 Auto burglars from New York to Los Angeles have added an explosive new item to 
their list of things to steal -- air bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance industry experts and police say the national outbreak is little more 
than a few months old, and although statistics are not yet available, there are 
plenty of word-of-mouth reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's becoming much more commonplace in urban areas throughout the country, 
specifically on the East and West Coast," said Steven Goldstein, vice president 
of the New York-based Insurance Information Institute, a national trade group 
representing property and casualty insurance carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 The thefts for sale to unscrupulous auto repair shops were first reported in 
Detroit in late 1992, and in the last six months the thefts have popped up in 
Los Angeles, New York, St. Louis and several New Jersey cities, Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are just no statistics available yet because it's a relatively new 
crime," Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County law enforcement experts that track auto theft said the air bag 
problem has not hit here yet but probably will. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had any experience with it and we would know," said California 
Highway Patrol Lt. Rick Criner, who works on the Orange County Auto Theft Task 
Force. "But if it's a problem in Los Angeles, chances are it will be a problem 
in Orange County before too long." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Southern California, from Long Beach to Santa Clarita, thieves are 
stealing the safety devices, which can cost up to $1,200, from cars parked in 
driveways, parking lots and even auto dealerships, police say. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, thieves took air bags from 14 cars at a Toyota dealership in 
Valencia -- leaving the usual target, the car stereos, untouched, said Scott 
Jackson, the dealership's parts and service director. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just broke the driver's side window, unhooked the battery, and I think 
it would be just a matter of moments before they took the bag," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thieves also took about 15 air bags from cars at two auto dealerships in the 
west San Fernando Valley over the last four months, said Detective Dexter 
Owens, who heads the Los Angeles Police Department's West Valley auto theft 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exploded," said LAPD Detective Mike Lewin, describing the popularity 
among car thieves. "Six months ago you didn't even hear about it. Now they're 
going through the roof," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto theft detectives in the Van Nuys and North Hollywood divisions report 
more than a dozen such thefts in the past month. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our area, it seems like I see it more and more often," said Detective 
Ernie Guzman, who heads the Van Nuys auto theft division. 
</P>
<P>
 The air bags, which inflate rapidly but briefly to cushion the impact on the 
driver or passengers in crashes at 15 m.p.h. or more, were once installed 
solely in expensive luxury cars. But as they began to appear as standard 
equipment in less expensive new cars, the number of thefts rose with them. 
</P>
<P>
 The market for stolen air bags seems to be expanding as well. Police suspect 
that some professional auto thieves are in league with body shops and workers 
who want the bags at reduced rates because they need them to complete repairs 
on cars involved in accidents in which the factory-installed bag inflated. The 
bags work only once and cannot be reused. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto dismantlers buy the bags as salvage items with no questions asked, 
reselling them to repair shops and home mechanics for about half the cost of a 
new bag. In the case of a Mercedes or Lexus, the replacement cost is about 
$1,200, without installation charges. New bags for other makes run $800 to 
$1,200. 
</P>
<P>
 A body shop worker with a supply of stolen air bags can pocket the difference 
between what is paid to the thief -- perhaps about $150 -- and the $1,000 or 
more that is billed to an insurance company or car owner for a new bag, Lewin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The major risk for air bag thieves is that the devices are activated by a 
small charge of gunpowder that can be detonated by static electricity, although 
there have been no reports of such incidents, said Detective Bob Graybill, who 
heads the Valley-based Community Effort to Combat Auto Theft, known as CECATS. 
</P>
<P>
 In tests conducted at an auto theft investigators' school operated by the 
LAPD, the bags, when inflated, rocketed up to 70 feet in the air, Detective Gil 
Hetrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it deployed while you had a bottle of soda pop, it would shove it right 
through your face," Hetrick said. "It would be like Mike Tyson hitting you 
right in the face." 
</P>
<P>
 When a motion detector senses the impact of the crash, it detonates a 
gunpowder-chemical charge, creating a cloud of gas that instantly snaps the 
balloon-like bag open. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Treinen, president of Special Devices Inc., a Santa Clarita-based maker of 
the explosive "initiators" that trigger air bag deployment, agreed, saying the 
initiators can cause serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it would blow your arm off, but it would certainly blow a 
finger off if you didn't know what you were doing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Treinen also confirmed that static electricity could, in extreme cases, 
trigger the initiator. Treinen said his company expects to sell about 7 million 
of the devices in this fiscal year, and demand is growing. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say it is next to impossible to find crooked repair shop 
operators and prove that they violated the law by receiving stolen goods. But 
in at least one case, catching the alleged thieves was easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewin was on the trail of a stolen car ring working in the Valley on Dec. 3 
when he noticed three men trying to break into his unmarked police car in the 
parking lot of the Northridge Fashion Center mall. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrested them and later discovered that one of the suspects, Sang Van Tran, 
35, of North Hills, was the same man he was looking for in connection with the 
theft of five cars that had been resold to unwitting victims after their 
vehicle identification numbers were altered. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his arrest, Tran had an air bag, also thought to be stolen, 
Lewin said. Lewin matched the serial number of the air bag with the vehicle 
identification number of a car that had been burglarized at a Metrolink parking 
lot in the West Valley, one of a dozen from which air bags had been stolen. 
Tran, who has been charged with nearly a dozen crimes in two separate cases, is 
awaiting trial in Los Angeles Superior Court, Lewin said.

UNION VOTE IS FRIDAY AT O.C. VANS PLANT; LABOR: ELECTION MAY PRESAGE WIDER 
ORGANIZING EFFORTS, ESPECIALLY AMONG IMMIGRANT WORKERS. 
</P>

<P>
 For the first time in the company's 28-year history, Vans Inc. will watch as 
its 1,400 manufacturing workers vote Friday on whether to form a union at the 
fashionable canvas shoe maker's largest plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does the vote signal dissatisfaction among some of the company's 
mostly Latino employees -- who the union says can't afford to pay their share 
of the company health plan -- it may foreshadow increased union activity in 
Orange County. Many manufacturing workers, especially eager-to-assimilate 
immigrants, are seeking additional workplace benefits, according to labor 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is likely to be an increase in union activity in Orange County because 
the manufacturing system is maturing now," said Allen Scott, director of the 
Lewis Center for Regional Policy Studies at UCLA. "We are going to see a period 
of rising expectations of the blue-collar workers there, especially the 
immigrants, as they become politically educated. The right to unionize is part 
of that." 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, widely considered a conservative area hostile to unions, an 
estimated 30% of manufacturing workers were unionized in 1965. But by 1979, as 
the strength of unions declined nationally and the makeup of the manufacturing 
industry shifted, that number had fallen to only 10%, Scott said, and it is now 
well below that. 
</P>
<P>
 This could all change. More than 100 workers, mostly Latino, at Taormina 
Industries, an Anaheim recycling firm with 500 employees, voted to unionize in 
November. Hotel Restaurant Employees Union Local 681 has been busy canvassing 
Latino neighborhoods in Anaheim. And Teamsters Local 396 is trying to recruit 
workers at three Orange County companies in addition to Vans. These include 
2,000 workers at a large local manufacturing firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The central dispute in the Vans election is over workers' ability to afford 
company-sponsored health benefits. The average Vans worker, according to the 
union, makes about $5.75 an hour, and finds health care too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is currently a genuine interest in organizing within the immigrant 
community, especially Latinos," said Miguel Caballero, legal director of the 
California Immigrant Workers Assn., a union-funded group in Los Angeles. "For 
years there has been an anti-immigrant bias by some units that saw immigrants 
used to break strikes or lower wages. But I think unions nationwide are taking 
a look at their policies." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizing immigrant workers -- whom unions actively courted in the early part 
of this century -- is again in vogue not only in California but throughout the 
Sun Belt. Still, some areas, such as Los Angeles, receive more attention than 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County is talked about as a particularly difficult place to organize, 
so unions often focus their efforts on metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles 
and the Bay Area, especially Silicon Valley," said Scott. "Hispanic workers are 
prime candidates, because they work in industries that are typically low wage, 
with particularly disagreeable working conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos in Southern California have been slow to organize, because many did 
not know their workplace rights and because many were afraid of losing their 
jobs or being deported if they were in this country illegally, labor leaders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a successful strike by drywall installers in 1992 sent a signal to 
Southern California employers. Mostly Mexican immigrants -- many in this 
country illegally with little formal education or English skills -- these 
workers took on the drywall subcontractors and the multibillion-dollar 
home-building industry and won. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, in front of a Vans shoe plant in Orange, union organizers held 
an afternoon rally as some work shifts ended and others began, attracting 
nearly 30 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying a Local 396 sign and waving to honking cars, Filomena Ramirez, 36, 
who has worked for the company for 14 years as a shoe seamstress, said she 
makes $6.50 an hour, or about $218 per week. She said she can't afford the 
company's health plan, which would cost $60 each week to cover her and her 
family. Her sister, Berta Vargas Lopez, 34, also works at the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, we're afraid we will lose our jobs, but we want to have benefits and we 
just can't afford it," said Ramirez. "I expected better conditions in the 
United States, but I see now that with the union we can get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Vans attorney Craig Gosselin agreed the company's health care plan is costly 
but said it would be less expensive if more of the workers would join. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Vans gave a 2.7% across-the-board pay increase to workers in March, 
pays 60% of health insurance benefits for all employees, provides life 
insurance to workers after one year of work, and provides one week of paid 
vacation after one year and three weeks after five years. He said all Vans 
employees are entitled to at least eight paid holidays each year, most recently 
Good Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pay at least 25% higher than minimum wage and these are low-skilled jobs. 
You're talking about making shoes," said Gosselin. "The union is creating a lot 
of confusion and unrest here. That's their job, but it's infuriating. We've had 
to spend a lot of money fighting this because they are confusing people." 
</P>
<P>
 But union supporter Hector Sanchez, a 28-year-old shoemaker who has worked at 
the company since 1983, said he is not confused. Workers are under pressure to 
produce more, he said, claiming he makes 750 pairs of shoes a day and was 
recently asked to increase production to 800 pairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are under so much pressure and if we have a problem there is nobody to 
help us," he said. "The company just says if you don't like this job -- the 
door is over there. Sometimes people cry and don't say anything if they want to 
keep their job." 
</P>
<P>
 Gosselin said the company has dropped plans to increase production. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the Vans plant, at least 10 workers sporting "Viva Vans" buttons 
bearing the word "union" in a circle with a slash through it said they 
supported the company and didn't want any part of the union. Many signed a 
petition asking the union to leave Vans alone and let the workers themselves 
negotiate with company officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Gosselin said the union is using misleading statements to persuade workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the union is singing a real seductive song, they are telling people 
they are going to make $15 an hour and have full health benefits," he said. 
"They make it into a class-warfare kind of game, telling workers that there are 
all these fat cats and no money goes to the people." 
</P>
<P>
 The workers will begin voting Friday at 10:30 a.m. Typically, a union 
organizes a company by collecting signatures from at least 50% of the workers. 
If a majority of the workers casting ballots vote for the union, then the union 
bargains with the employer for an initial contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of Latino workers who are unionized remains relatively small 
nationwide. The latest figures show that only 1.3 million of the 13.3 million 
members of the AFL-CIO are Latino. This is at a time when union membership 
continues to drop; in 1991, the national AFL-CIO had 14 million members. 
</P>
<P>
 To combat this, the Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union Local 681 is 
conducting a grass-roots organizing campaign among Latino hotel workers in 
Anaheim. Since mid-February, union leaders have canvassed neighborhoods at 
night, meeting with workers after they leave their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are contacting people in their homes where they feel more comfortable, 
rather than approaching them in a more stressful situation such as the 
workplace," said Angela Keefe, president of the Local 681. 
</P>
<P>
 At Taormina Industries in Anaheim, more than 100 workers who sort recyclables 
from the trash elected to unionize in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are looking for medical benefits and representation," said Vincent 
Taormina, chief executive officer for the company. "We are now in negotiations 
with them and things are going fine."

O.C. AGENCIES FEAR IMPACT OF '3 STRIKES' LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH and KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new "three strikes" law aimed at locking up career criminals could place a 
heavy toll on nearly every law enforcement and social service agency in Orange 
County, according to a report released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A worst-case scenario could bring the civil court system to a virtual 
standstill to make way for more criminal trials, cause more severe jail 
crowding, place increased demands on probation officers and trigger an 
expansion of the local welfare rolls, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the hidden consequences of the legislation is expected to be a growing 
dependence on social programs should criminal cases begin to overwhelm the 
court system, county Social Services Director Larry Leaman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, convictions result in families seeking welfare support or 
placing children in government custody, according to the report by the Orange 
County Administrative Office. Any noticeable increase in the conviction rate 
and length of time served under the new law could cause a dramatic growth in 
government expenses to maintain those services. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not just a hysterical reaction," Leaman said. "These decisions, quite 
often, set off a series of domino actions that we don't expect or that are not 
immediately visible." 
</P>
<P>
 The full brunt of the law will not be felt for several months, but county 
officials, judges and attorneys agree that local governments should be prepared 
to dedicate more money to public safety with no guarantees that the investment 
will bring a decrease in crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "This thing could be damn bad," Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley 
said, describing the financial implications of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Riley's concerns is that the new law would exacerbate crowded 
conditions in the county jail system and lead to more early releases of those 
charged with lesser offenses such as drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County jail system population, already governed by a federal court 
order, is expected to rise as more career-criminal cases are filed and brought 
to trial, the report stated. 
</P>
<P>
 For the county, the potential cost increases come at a difficult time as local 
government revenues continue to shrink because of higher unemployment rates, 
increased municipal incorporations and the lagging state economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Signed into law last month by Gov. Pete Wilson, the "three-strikes" 
legislation has created a flurry of concerns, questions and criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Wilson set out to defend the law, saying that it would actually 
save potential crime victims at least $140,000 for every inmate incarcerated 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Critics point to the costs of locking up these violent thugs and argue that 
California cannot afford it," Wilson said in a written statement. "I say again, 
we can't afford not to." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said the potential savings were only conservative estimates, contending 
that each year that a repeat felon is taken off the streets, between 15 and 187 
crimes are prevented. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the debate over costs, perhaps the only certain result of the 
"three-strikes" legislation will be legal challenges, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 The law mandates a minimum sentence of 25 years to life for third-time felons 
who have racked up two prior convictions for crimes, ranging from residential 
burglary to murder. The law also calls for more prison time for those with one 
or more "strikes" -- including juvenile convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Corrections has predicted it must build 20 additional 
prisons under the new law -- a prison costs about $500 million to build -- and 
spend $2 billion a year to operate them. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, authorities anticipate that adult trials will increase by 
30%, and juvenile court trials may increase by as much as 50%, possibly 
requiring additional staff in most criminal justice agencies, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's nothing to lose by going to trial, it's not really a gamble," 
Orange County Public Defender Ronald Y. Butler said. "If you go to trial you're 
giving a client the opportunity of an acquittal or a (conviction on a) lesser 
charge. There's just no reason not to go to trial." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Orange County prosecutors have filed only two cases under the new 
legislation and are carefully reviewing each eligible case, said Chief 
Assistant Dist. Atty. Maurice Evans. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we're taking a kind of a wait-and-see attitude," Evans said, 
adding that it is not yet clear how often the new law will be used. "It's just 
too early to tell." 
</P>
<P>
 In one instance, prosecutors believed the penalty did not fit the suspected 
crime and they moved to dismiss the "three-strikes" enhancement against a 
repeat felon charged with possessing a small amount of heroin, Evans said. 
Prosecutors may decide in rare cases to exercise discretion in declining to 
file charges, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is written, however, the law does not appear to give prosecutors much 
room for interpretation, and Butler said disagreements about the new 
legislation will linger until the courts rule on expected challenges to the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge James L. Smith, the county's presiding judge, has said he 
does not see a looming crisis, believing that the courts can absorb the impact. 
However, Smith said he is also prepared to use temporary judges or halt civil 
cases to give criminal trials priority if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 It's only a matter of time before the court system "gets clogged up," said 
Eileen Walsh, the county's director of finance and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a huge problem right now," Walsh said. "No one is asking for 
additional resources. We'll be better able to get a handle on things in the 
next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Many say the effect of the law will be determined by how frequently 
prosecutors proceed on the charge. But Evans and other court officials say the 
impact will also depend on how defense attorneys respond to the new cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys have criticized the law as being too broad, unfairly 
counting juvenile convictions as "strikes." Opponents also say the law strips 
judges of their discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side, supporters hail the legislation as an important step in 
sweeping the streets of violent repeat offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those county and law enforcement officials who are generally supportive 
of the legislation express concern that little consideration was given to the 
law's ultimate effect on the social service system. 
</P>
<P>
 But local authorities are especially concerned about the law's effect on the 
local jail population. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know right now the law will benefit us," Riley said. "But tomorrow we may 
not have any more money. Emotions on these kinds of things tend to carry a 
great deal of weight, but there is not a lot of attention to how much it's 
going to cost down the road. I just don't know how this will translate in 
Orange County right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his worries, Riley said he supports the legislation and believes the 
potential benefits should be worth the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Marshal Michael S. Carona said it would be at least six months 
before local officials could begin assessing the costs of the new criminal 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be a tough one," said Carona, whose force of more than 120 
officers provides security for the Orange County court system. "We just don't 
know yet, but we have to prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of that preparation could involve the shift of about 30 deputy marshals 
from civil court duty to the criminal courts, should the courts become loaded 
with "three-strikes" cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Carona said that shift alone could cost the county nearly $1 million in 
increased salaries and could expose officers and prisoners to more violent 
conditions in crowded courthouse holding cells.

7 ISRAELIS KILLED IN SUICIDE BOMBING; MIDEAST: CAR DRIVEN BY PALESTINIAN 
EXPLODES NEAR BUS PICKING UP STUDENTS, INJURING 45 OTHERS. EXTREMISTS CLAIM 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPARENT REPRISAL FOR HEBRON MASSACRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A car packed with high explosives, nails and propane gas driven by a 
Palestinian suicide bomber exploded near a commuter bus Wednesday as it stopped 
for students in northern Israel, killing at least seven Israelis as well as the 
car's driver and injuring 45 others. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack was apparently a reprisal for a Jewish settler's massacre of about 
30 Palestinian worshipers in Hebron on Feb. 25; it was timed to coincide with 
the 40th day of Islamic mourning for those killed in the Cave of the 
Patriarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli police said Hamas, a radical Palestinian fundamentalist group, claimed 
responsibility for Wednesday's explosion, which sent pieces of the bus, car and 
their occupants flying dozens of yards in the sleepy blue-collar town of Afula. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses described a horrible scene. The blast left its young victims mangled 
and burned, and a square block was strewn with bodies and parts of bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 The brutal incident shocked Israel on the eve of its annual Holocaust 
commemoration. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night at the Holocaust Museum here, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin did 
not comment on the attack at ceremonies marking the day Israel has set aside to 
recall the killing of 6 million Jews by Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 But President Ezer Weizman declared: "Today, on the eve of the Holocaust 
memorial day, we paid a heavy price for being Jews, for working to live a 
peaceful life in the land of Israel. The long, historic cycle of blood 
continues . . . and this criminal act of terror took place as the hope and 
expectations for peace are standing at the gate." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Israelis expressed deeper anger at the bus bombing. At the blast scene 
in Afula, some chanted "Death to Arabs." There were dozens of angry protest 
rallies across the country by opposition groups -- unprecedented on a day that 
Israel sets aside for its Holocaust remembrance and quiet reflection. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's attack provoked fears of new retaliation and shook the peace 
process that has fueled escalating violence by extremist groups on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 As right-wing Jewish settlers staged demonstrations Wednesday night to protest 
both the attack and the Israeli government's decision to continue negotiating 
with the Palestine Liberation Organization over Palestinian autonomy in the 
occupied territories, Israeli army and police officials braced for more 
bloodletting. 
</P>
<P>
 All roads into Afula were closed. Israeli police and army reinforcements were 
rushed to nearby Arab towns. Police evacuated all Arab workers who were in 
Afula at the time to protect them. The army and police clamped more security 
measures on Israeli-occupied territories, already sealed off after the Hebron 
massacre as a precaution against revenge attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking amid the wreckage at the site of the noon bombing, Police Minister 
Moshe Shahal insisted that nothing could have prevented the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the massive police reinforcements and security precautions in place 
for the past month have prevented "a big part of the intended (revenge) 
attacks." Police and army officials have said armed Palestinian fundamentalist 
and extremist groups vowed to retaliate against the Israelis for the Hebron 
killings, which Israel's government has blamed on a lone madman. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rafi Peled, Israel's police chief, said he will take even stricter 
measures in the territories, including barring all cars from the area entering 
Israel -- even with special permits -- for at least a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the car used in Wednesday's attack -- a light-blue Opel Ascona 
sedan with Israeli license plates that didn't belong with it -- was stolen in 
Tel Aviv on March 23. Investigators speculated that the vehicle was smuggled 
into the territories and kept there until Wednesday, when it crossed back into 
Israel from the northern West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The savagery of the attack in Afula -- a town hit in the past by Palestinian 
terrorists operating across Israel's more porous northern border with the 
occupied West Bank -- brought calls from the Israeli opposition for suspension 
of negotiations with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 Formal talks between Israel and the PLO reconvened in Egypt last week for the 
first time since the Hebron massacre. (Those sessions were adjourned Wednesday 
until Sunday as Israeli delegates insisted on making a scheduled departure for 
Holocaust commemorations at home.) 
</P>
<P>
 Many Israelis were incensed that PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, in Cairo for 
consultations on the autonomy talks, had not condemned the assault. The United 
States, which decried the attack, urged him to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government's policy of nonstop concessions to the PLO and terrorism only 
brings us more and more terrorism," declared Benjamin Netanyahu, Likud Party 
chairman and leader of Israel's political right, which has opposed the 
Palestinian autonomy plan since its signing in Washington last September. "The 
government should stop the peace talks immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 He and other opposition leaders directly linked Wednesday's bombing to the 
return to the Gaza Strip and Jericho less than 24 hours earlier of 50 
Palestinian deportees -- engineers of the intifada , the Palestinian uprising, 
and key activists of Arafat's Fatah wing who had been expelled years ago as 
suspected terrorist leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Their dramatic re-entry, a key concession by the Israeli government, was among 
the first real signs of change in the occupied lands, and it fueled hopes among 
many Palestinians and Israelis of an imminent agreement on Israel's 
long-delayed promise to withdraw its troops and allow Palestinian autonomy 
beginning in Gaza and Jericho. But Netanyahu observed, "On the day that this 
government brings back deported terrorists comes this despicable, murderous 
attack in Afula." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, chief architect of the "Gaza-Jericho first" 
agreement, deflected the criticism and rejected calls to suspend the peace 
process. "We know that there are people who want to murder peace, who want to 
kill Jews," he said. "There's no relation between the two. And I don't believe 
the Likud or anyone else can stop the flow of history." 
</P>
<P>
 There were strong condemnations of the attack from PLO officials in the 
occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
 Diab Alouch, head of Arafat's information department in Gaza City, condemned 
Hamas, the group that claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement from 
Jordan, in a telephone call to a Western news agency in Jerusalem and through 
loudspeakers of mosques in the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, as a Palestinian, this hurts me, what happened in Afula," Alouch 
said. "It also hurts me what happened in Jabaliya (where six Arafat activists 
were slain by an Israeli undercover unit last week) and what happened in 
Hebron. Everything I hear about killing and the spilling of blood always hurts 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Eyewitness accounts of the attack on the Eged Bus Lines commuter coach as it 
made its second stop on Route No. 438 at 12:10 p.m. Wednesday were chilling 
enough to shock even people who have lived through this region's cycles of 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 A nearby school had just ended classes for the day. Young Jewish students 
streamed toward the approaching bus for home. Suddenly, the light-blue Opel, 
which had been parked not far away, blew up. The explosion shook the town. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we arrived, the mushroom cloud of smoke was still in the air," said a 
firefighter who was the first on the scene, which he described in vivid, 
gruesome terms. He said the street was covered with oil, seared metal and 
nails, which police said were packed in the car bomb to maximize its effect. 
</P>
<P>
 As of late Wednesday, police said they had managed to identify just four of 
the seven dead Israelis: the bus driver, two 17-year-old girls and an Arab 
woman from a nearby village. 
</P>
<P>
 The identity of the suicide bomber has not been confirmed. A caller -- who 
said that Hamas was responsible for the attack -- identified the car's driver 
as Raid Zakarna, 19, from a village just across the Green Line from Afula in 
the West Bank. The caller said the car contained almost 400 pounds of 
explosives. 
</P>
<P>
 Military sources confirmed that Zakarna was on an Israeli army list of 
fugitive members of Hamas' extremist armed wing, the Izzedine al Qassim 
Brigade. Police said they found a banner denouncing the peace process and a 
Koran, the Islamic holy book, near the debris of the car.

TWO AFRICAN PRESIDENTS DIE IN PLANE CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The presidents of Rwanda and Burundi were killed in a plane crash near this 
capital city's airport Wednesday as they flew back together from regional peace 
talks in Tanzania. Rwandan diplomats charged that the plane was shot down. 
</P>
<P>
 Presidents Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda and Cyprian Ntayamira of Burundi had 
been in Tanzania for a meeting of east-central African leaders seeking ways to 
end ethnic violence in the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Rwanda and Burundi have been racked by bloodletting between the rival Hutu and 
Tutsi ethnic groups. The deaths of the presidents, both Hutus, are almost sure 
to inflame tensions in both countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The French Embassy in Kigali confirmed that both presidents were killed in the 
crash. About 10 people were aboard, and there were no survivors, the embassy 
said. Witnesses heard heavy-weapons fire around the airport shortly before the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened was not an accident but an assassination," Rwanda's U.N. 
ambassador, Jean Damascene Bizimana, told reporters at the United Nations after 
the 15 Security Council members stood for a minute of silence in an unusual 
tribute. 
</P>
<P>
 The council expressed its "shock and distress" and called for calm while the 
crash is investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 Bizimana said the plane was hit by rocket fire but did not say who attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 Francois Ngarukintwali, the Rwandan ambassador in Brussels, quoted the chief 
of staff of the Rwandan Cabinet, Enoch Ruhigira, as saying that the plane was 
attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was shot down. It's true. It burned," Ngarukintwali told the Associated 
Press, adding that he could not confirm the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Lane, the economic officer at the U.S. Embassy in Kigali, said she was 
at her home, about a 10-minute drive from the airport, at the time of the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were all kinds of sounds and explosions. We could hear some shots. We 
did not know what it was, and we were all instructed to stay in our houses, 
which we did," she said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a terrible, terrible catastrophe for both countries at this very 
dangerous time," said a Western diplomat in Burundi's capital, Bujumbura. 
"Anything could happen." But he added that Bujumbura was quiet immediately 
following the news. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bujumbura, a Hutu resident whose mother and father were injured in a 
grenade attack last month said: "Everyone is hiding indoors and listening to 
their radios. We fear for our lives and country." 
</P>
<P>
 The African leaders had met in the Tanzanian capital of Dar Es Salaam earlier 
Wednesday to seek a regional approach to end tensions in Burundi and Rwanda. 
The deep rivalries between the Hutu majority in both tiny central African 
states and the Tutsi minority have given both countries bloody histories since 
before independence in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Tutsi make up only 15% of Burundi's population, they controlled 
the country until President Melchior Ndadaye -- a Hutu -- won the nation's 
first democratic election last June. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Ndadaye's assassination in October, up to 100,000 people have died in 
ethnic violence and 1 million have fled to other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Ntayamira, 38, was elected president by Burundi's National Assembly in 
January, but the Tutsi still dominate the army. 
</P>
<P>
 The ethnic hatred has exploded repeatedly since Burundi gained independence 
from Belgium, with an estimated 100,000 people, mainly Hutu, killed in 
massacres in 1972. In August, 1988, Hutu farmers along the border with Rwanda 
staged an uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 In neighboring Rwanda, Habyarimana's Hutu coalition reached a peace accord in 
August with the former Rwandan Patriotic Front rebels, made up mainly of 
minority Tutsi, but they have failed to agree on a transitional government. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest attempt failed Feb. 22 after two politicians were assassinated by 
Tutsi fighters. An estimated 2,000 civilians died in 2 1/2 years of war, and 
nearly 1 million were forced from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. envoy to Rwanda, Jacques-Roger Booh Booh, had warned earlier this 
month that the tiny country faced collapse and a new civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Habyarimana, 57, took power in a bloodless coup in 1973.

COLUMN ONE; CRACKING A HISTORY OF SKEPTICISM; THEIR COLLEGE IS QUIRKY AND A BIT 
HARD TO FIND. BUT THE CLEVELANDS, ONE OF CHIROPRACTIC'S FOUNDING FAMILIES, ARE 
TRAINING STUDENTS TO CARRY ON THEIR DECADES-OLD BATTLE FOR RESPECT. 
</P>

<P>
 Drivers who venture off the Hollywood Freeway at Vermont Avenue will see a 
trio of green signs directing them to institutions of learning: the Braille 
Institute, Los Angeles City College and West Coast University. What they will 
not see, because it is not there, is a sign for Cleveland Chiropractic College. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not for lack of trying. City and state officials, for reasons that are 
a mystery to those who run this little family-operated school, refuse to put 
one up. "You can't fight City Hall," sighs the chancellor, Dr. Carl S. 
Cleveland Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland knows about fights. At 75, he is the patriarch of a chiropractic 
dynasty, a heavyweight in a field that has fought for survival since its 
inception. Well-known in chiropractic circles but otherwise anonymous, his 
family has for decades carried the torch of one of health care's most 
controversial professions. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland's grandmother was a chiropractor; she learned the craft from D. D. 
Palmer, the Iowa fish salesman who founded chiropractic 99 years ago when, the 
legend goes, he restored hearing to a deaf man by adjusting his spine. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland's parents became chiropractors in the days when people got arrested 
for it. They founded the first Cleveland Chiropractic College in Kansas City, 
Mo., in 1922, with three students in a brick and stone duplex. He remembers his 
parents' urgent whispering at every knock at the door: Was it a new recruit? A 
prospective patient? Or the local flatfoots, coming to take them away for 
practicing medicine without a license? 
</P>
<P>
 His late wife, Mildred, was . . . You guessed it. So is his son, Carl 
Cleveland III, president of the Kansas City college and the sister school in 
Los Angeles. So too, will be his grandchildren. Says Carl Cleveland III, 47: "I 
was 11 years old before I realized that everybody doesn't grow up to be a 
chiropractor." 
</P>
<P>
 Their Los Angeles campus is a crucible in a field that is constantly being 
tested. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, the school is a metaphor for chiropractic itself, a David clinging 
to unconventional principles, slinging stones at the Goliath of traditional 
medicine. Within its peach-colored walls, the profession and its practitioners, 
their triumphs and follies, are laid bare for all who care to look. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, eager students line up for back adjustments from a professor after 
class. Neck pain, back pain, stomach pain, step right up, Dr. Kevin Kelly will 
handle all comers. A few cracks here, a pop and a crunch there and Kelly sends 
his customers happily on their way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you very much, Dr. Kelly," one young woman says after her back has been 
adjusted. "It was sooooo good." To which Kelly, a former construction worker 
who became a chiropractor after he injured his back, says: "I'm the best damn 
adjuster in the world. I love adjusting people. I could sit here and do this 
all day." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who teach and study at Cleveland are acutely aware of the perception 
that chiropractors are quacks. Debates about the profession, its image and its 
future, echo through the stairwells and corridors. White-coated student interns 
revel in their successes, such as the man whose back pain stifled his bedroom 
activities. After several treatments, he bounded into the school's clinic, 
grinning ear to ear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had sex! I had sex!" he bellowed to the bewildered intern. "You're a 
miracle worker!" 
</P>
<P>
 Here, the clinic's star patient -- a recovering alcoholic in a wheelchair who 
nearly died after being beaten unconscious on Skid Row -- visits a class of 
incoming students to lecture them about what they can expect from their 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
 James Fadely is a rough-looking 54, with a beard that resembles steel wool. He 
wears a bolo tie and kelly green vest festooned with seven buttons that each 
read: "Remember the McMartin case. Support Michael Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through his message, Fadely slowly rises to his feet. He is wobbly, and 
knobby-kneed. But he is standing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the best audiovisual aid this school has," he declares proudly. "As I 
told Dr. Cleveland, 'You damn chiropractors! You don't know how good you are.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland is one of 14 accredited chiropractic colleges in the nation, and is 
one of two in Los Angeles; the other is Los Angeles College of Chiropractic in 
Whittier. Of the 14, only the Cleveland schools are family-run. But, as 
nonprofit institutions, they are not family-owned. "We don't own a brick," Carl 
Cleveland III says. 
</P>
<P>
 The students pay about $50,000 for three years and four months (10 trimesters) 
of training. By the time they finish, they are steeped in anatomy, physiology 
and the varied techniques of chiropractic. More important, they will know 
philosophy. Not Plato, but rather Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Their immersion begins with a course taught by Dr. Carl Cleveland Jr. (With so 
many Clevelands here, and junior being senior, the elder Cleveland is known 
simply as Dr. Carl. His son is Dr. C. III.) 
</P>
<P>
 The course lays out the basic principle of chiropractic: that misalignments of 
the spine -- called "subluxations" -- can cause disease by preventing the 
nerves from flowing freely to the organs. Chiropractic (Greek for "done by 
hand") asserts that once the vertebrae are put back into alignment, the body 
has the "innate intelligence" to heal itself. Drugs and surgery are shunned. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics abound. The biggest and most powerful is the American Medical Assn. 
For decades, the AMA forbid its members to refer patients to chiropractors -- 
until some chiropractors filed a federal lawsuit, which they won in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chiropractors saying they can cure disease (more effectively than) medical 
physicians is like the Boy Scouts arguing with Caltech about who understands 
nuclear physics," says Dr. Seth Asser, a pediatrics professor at UC San Diego. 
"It's just wishful thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Carl Cleveland Jr. likes to say he is living proof that the critics are 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Portly and balding, he looks like a kindly pediatrician in a Norman Rockwell 
painting. He has never visited a medical doctor, other than for an insurance 
exam, and has never had a vaccination. Nor has he had mumps or any other 
childhood disease, except the measles, which he got in high school "for half a 
day." He was cured, he says, after his father adjusted him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I'm not telling you that chiropractic is a cure-all," Cleveland 
announced to his class one morning. "But in my lifetime, all the conditions 
that I suffered from were handled by my parents. I had my first adjustment at 2 
days old and then I was adjusted whenever my parents felt it was necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Students never tire of hearing him talk of the old days, of how his 
grandmother became a disciple of Palmer after a chiropractor cured her of 
diabetes, how his father escorted patients to see jailed chiropractors, how he 
earned money as a boy by dissecting cadavers in the duplex's former kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people kept it alive," says Jessica Ramirez, 32, one of 30 students who 
will graduate Saturday to become a D.C. -- doctor of chiropractic. "They 
fought. They're the originals." 
</P>
<P>
 Fought indeed. Like a gnat on an elephant's ear, the Clevelands and their 
fellow chiropractors have been nibbling away at organized medicine, and they 
have racked up some striking victories. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 21 million Americans visited chiropractors last year. Many 
insurance plans -- including government-funded Medicare -- reimburse for 
chiropractic. And although there is no evidence to support claims that it can 
cure disease -- or even that subluxations exist -- recent research, including a 
1991 study by the RAND Corp., shows the method eases lower back pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, about 50 hospitals nationwide allow chiropractors to admit patients 
when a medical doctor co-signs the order. At Coast Plaza Doctors Hospital in 
Norwalk, Cleveland College interns are doing rotations -- observing surgeons, 
pathologists and radiologists. 
</P>
<P>
 The profession has taken some hard hits, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford University researchers recently reported that in rare cases twisting 
the neck during chiropractic treatment can cause a stroke. And a recent expose 
on TV's "20/20" uncovered serious lapses in the treatment of children by some 
chiropractors. In one case, a boy was paralyzed after chiropractic treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Mainstream chiropractors, including the American Chiropractic Assn., have 
denounced the doctors featured on the show. But they insist that adjusting 
children -- even infants -- is appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, seven years after the profession's big victory in federal court, 
practitioners say there still are battles to be fought. Inclusion in President 
Clinton's health care reform package is one. Winning respect, ever-elusive, is 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mission, my reason for being on this Earth," Carl Cleveland III declares 
with deadly seriousness, "is to position chiropractic as a first-class clinical 
science on a global basis." 
</P>
<P>
 His local launching pad for this campaign is a rickety building at 590 Vermont 
Ave., in the heart of workingman's Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 With 520 students and 32 full-time faculty members, CCC-L.A., as the school is 
known, isn't the biggest chiropractic college in the nation; Palmer College of 
Chiropractic in Davenport, Iowa, has 1,800 students. As to whether it is the 
best, that is a matter of opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 One student says he enrolled because "it's supposed to be the Harvard of all 
chiropractic schools." But Dr. Kathleen Wells, who teaches palpation techniques 
-- the art of identifying the vertebrae through touch -- offers a more subdued 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like Avis," she says. "We try harder." 
</P>
<P>
 The students are a varied lot. Their average entering age is 30; for many, 
chiropractic is a second career. Thirty-nine countries are represented, and 40% 
of the students are women. Of the 300 to 400 applications received each year, 
admission officials say, 180 are accepted. About 8% drop out. 
</P>
<P>
 If they finish, they may be well-compensated; the average American 
chiropractor earns $102,000 year, about the same as a general practitioner. 
Before practicing, however, graduates must pass qualifying boards and be 
licensed by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 A four-year college degree is not required for admission, although it will be 
by 2000 -- a big step for a profession that once gave out diplomas by mail 
order. The current requirement is 75 college credits -- about 2 1/2 years of 
undergraduate work, including courses in biology, biochemistry and physics. As 
one Cleveland official said wryly: "Welding doesn't count." 
</P>
<P>
 Who comes here? Some are would-be doctors who couldn't get into medical 
school. Others, like the Clevelands, are following a family tradition. Kelli 
Molthen, a 29-year-old from Cerritos, will be the 60th chiropractor in her 
family. "There was never any question," she says, "that I would go to 
Cleveland." 
</P>
<P>
 Many select chiropractic after good experiences as patients. Thus Jeff Parent, 
a 37-year-old contractor who was helped by a chiropractor, is now becoming one. 
So, too, are Hugh and Drew Gordon, 28-year-old identical twins from Beverly 
Hills who played minor league baseball until Drew got cut and Hugh got injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother always wanted a nice Jewish doctor in the family," Hugh says. 
</P>
<P>
 The place where they learn what the school calls "the philosophy, science and 
art of chiropractic" is so unobtrusive that many Angelenos don't even know it 
is there. 
</P>
<P>
 (This might change, of course, if it had a freeway sign. City policy says a 
facility must be of "widespread general public interest" to warrant a sign, and 
Caltrans requires 1,000 full-time students, although the Braille Institute says 
it has only 800.) 
</P>
<P>
 The heating and cooling system is a little out of whack, and so on hot days 
the windows are cranked wide open, and the noise from busy Vermont Avenue and 
the nearby Hollywood Freeway is sometimes so deafening that students strain to 
hear. When trucks rumble by, it feels like an earthquake. No one ever remarks 
on this. They just talk louder. 
</P>
<P>
 The display in the audiovisual center is tired, with various bones encased in 
yellowing plexiglass. Paint is peeling, walls are cracked -- courtesy of the 
Northridge quake. The plastic classroom chairs are so uncomfortable that some 
students bring their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic, which treats the poor for free, is crowded. Many patients walk in 
off the street because they have nowhere else to go, which puts the interns in 
the position of managing their care, referring them to medical doctors when 
necessary. This is a point of pride at Cleveland. Interns see patients with 
AIDS, cancer, diabetes -- a population far more diverse than most will treat in 
private practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the delicate matter of the mice. "I didn't say this, OK?" one 
intern confides. "But every once in a while, you see a little mouse scamper 
through here." Once, a patient stepped on a trap and squished a furry critter. 
</P>
<P>
 Such physical shortcomings are not lost on the chancellor and his son. They 
dream of making their little college state-of-the-art -- if only they could 
afford it. But with a $4-million annual operating budget, the school struggles 
to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 The electric bills alone run $385 a day. Tuition, which costs $4,280 a 
trimester, makes up 80% of the school's income. Alumni donations and clinic 
fees account for the rest. There are no dormitories, no big endowments, no help 
from state taxpayers, no research grants from the National Institutes of Health 
(the federal government has yet to fund a study of chiropractic.) 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, the annual operating budget of USC Medical School is more than 
$350 million, and tuition, at close to $24,000 a year, accounts for just 5% of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look around and I see all the things that medical colleges have that we 
don't . . . and I get very discouraged," the elder Cleveland laments. "But then 
I think about what my parents had to work with, how little they had compared to 
what we have now." 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Cleveland, recently elected president of the Council on 
Chiropractic Education, which accredits chiropractic colleges, is out to 
improve their standing. By 2005, he says, he wants to see chiropractic colleges 
incorporated into universities, the same as schools of medicine or law. 
</P>
<P>
 USC-Cleveland College of Chiropractic? He thinks it has a nice ring to it. 
</P>
<P>
 He has other plans, as well, to carry on the work of his forebears. He wants 
the military to offer chiropractic treatment. He would like to see more 
chiropractors practicing in hospitals. He hopes health plans will name them 
primary care physicians -- the so-called gatekeepers who care for basic patient 
needs and decide when to call in specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 And if they could just get that sign. . . .

 A longstanding bastion of male domination at the Los Angeles Police Department 
fell Wednesday as the LAPD agreed to accept the first female officer into the 
internationally acclaimed Special Weapons and Tactics unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The historic move came after the officer, Nina Damianakes, filed suit in state 
and federal courts last month, charging that she was being denied admission to 
SWAT because she is a woman. In SWAT's history of more than 20 years, no woman 
officer has been assigned there. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Damianakes, 34, will actually join the unit still was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorney, Patrick McNicholas, said Wednesday that Damianakes, "per 
doctor's orders," would not report for SWAT duty today. In an interview with 
The Times last week, she said she has been under great stress as a result of 
her treatment by the department and has been seeing a doctor because of it. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to granting Damianakes a position, the LAPD has agreed to suspend 
all SWAT testing because the procedures may have discriminated against female 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Staff's investigation did not reveal any disparate treatment against 
(Damianakes) on the basis of gender as she claims," according to the 
department's grievance response, a copy of which was obtained by The Times on 
Wednesday. "However, the investigation did reveal some internal flaws in the 
construction and administration of the selection process which could be viewed 
by a third party . . . as insufficiently job-related and possibly having a 
disparate impact on female candidates." 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD officials declined comment on the case Wednesday. It is the department's 
policy not to comment on personnel matters or on pending litigation. The 
department's decision to grant her grievance does not settle Damianakes' 
lawsuits, so the litigation may continue. 
</P>
<P>
 In granting her grievance, the LAPD agreed to assign her to SWAT school. The 
department said it would transfer her to SWAT -- a 60-member unit whose 
officers routinely perform some of the most arduous and challenging duties 
faced by police officers anywhere -- when she completes that school in four 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, according to critics of the SWAT testing process, the LAPD 
agreed to "undertake an in-depth analysis of the SWAT testing procedures 
utilizing the expertise of test research personnel outside the department." 
</P>
<P>
 Hank Hernandez, general counsel for the Police Protective League, said the 
department's willingness to bring in outsiders to study the testing procedures 
will help assure that admission into SWAT is handled fairly. The league has 
backed Damianakes, assisting her with her grievance and supporting her decision 
to bring the lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Damianakes was not available for comment Wednesday, she said in an 
interview with The Times last week that she has wanted to be a member of the 
LAPD's most exclusive unit since she joined the force in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I've done in my career has been to get to SWAT," said Damianakes, 
who was accepted into the LAPD's elite Metro Division in 1988, a prerequisite 
for joining SWAT. "I turned down jobs at the academy. I turned down the 
opportunity to work for Chief (Daryl F.) Gates on a permanent basis. I passed 
up opportunities to promote. This is all I ever wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Damianakes has been commended on numerous occasions and has been repeatedly 
encouraged to apply for the special weapons unit. Her colleagues and 
supervisors speak glowingly of her talents as a police officer, and many were 
disappointed when she failed twice to qualify for SWAT. 
</P>
<P>
 She first was allowed to take the rigorous physical training test for the unit 
in 1990. After failing it, she was allowed to try again last year, but 
department officials rated her near the bottom of the 20 officers who took that 
test. 
</P>
<P>
 Damianakes, an accomplished athlete whose rating reports include strong 
recommendations from her supervisors, maintained that the real reason she 
ranked so low was that she is a woman. She did not seek any change in the test 
itself but instead argued that the rating system was biased against her. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's decision to grant her a place in SWAT was accompanied by a 
personal note from Police Chief Willie L. Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have every confidence that you can and will be a success in your new 
assignment to SWAT," wrote Williams. "I hope it will challenge you to be the 
very best. We ask only that you bring your dedication, enthusiasm and talent to 
the job."

AIR BAG THEFT AN EXPANDING NEW PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Auto burglars from New York to Los Angeles have added an explosive new item to 
their list of things to steal -- air bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance industry experts and police say the national outbreak is little more 
than a few months old, and although statistics are not yet available, there are 
plenty of word-of-mouth reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's becoming much more commonplace in urban areas throughout the country, 
specifically on the East and West Coast," said Steven Goldstein, vice president 
of the New York-based Insurance Information Institute, a national trade group 
representing property and casualty insurance carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 The thefts for sale to unscrupulous auto repair shops were first reported in 
Detroit in late 1992, and in the last six months the thefts have popped up in 
Los Angeles, New York, St. Louis and several New Jersey cities, Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are just no statistics available yet because it's a relatively new 
crime," Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Southern California, from Long Beach to Santa Clarita, thieves are 
stealing the safety devices, which can cost up to $1,200, from cars parked in 
driveways, parking lots and even auto dealerships, police say. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, thieves took air bags from 14 cars at a Toyota dealership in 
Valencia -- leaving the usual target, the car stereos, untouched, said Scott 
Jackson, the dealership's parts and service director. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just broke the driver's side window, unhooked the battery, and I think 
it would be just a matter of moments before they took the bag," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thieves also took about 15 air bags from cars at two auto dealerships in the 
west San Fernando Valley over the last four months, said Detective Dexter 
Owens, who heads the Los Angeles Police Department's West Valley auto theft 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exploded," said LAPD Detective Mike Lewin, describing the popularity 
among car thieves. "Six months ago you didn't even hear about it. Now they're 
going through the roof," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto theft detectives in the Van Nuys and North Hollywood divisions report 
more than a dozen such thefts in the past month. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our area, it seems like I see it more and more often," said Detective 
Ernie Guzman, who heads the Van Nuys auto theft division. 
</P>
<P>
 The air bags, which inflate rapidly but briefly to cushion the impact on the 
driver or passengers in crashes at 15 m.p.h. or more, were once installed 
solely in expensive luxury cars. But as they began to appear as standard 
equipment in less expensive new cars, the number of thefts rose with them. 
</P>
<P>
 The market for stolen air bags seems to be expanding as well. Police suspect 
that some professional auto thieves are in league with body shops and workers 
who want the bags at reduced rates because they need them to complete repairs 
on cars involved in accidents in which the factory-installed bag inflated. The 
bags work only once and cannot be reused. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto dismantlers buy the bags as salvage items with no questions asked, 
reselling them to repair shops and home mechanics for about half the cost of a 
new bag. In the case of a Mercedes or Lexus, the replacement cost is about 
$1,200, without installation charges. New bags for other makes run $800 to 
$1,200. 
</P>
<P>
 A body shop worker with a supply of stolen air bags can pocket the difference 
between what is paid to the thief -- perhaps about $150 -- and the $1,000 or 
more that is billed to an insurance company or car owner for a new bag, Lewin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The major risk for air bag thieves is that the devices are activated by a 
small charge of gunpowder that can be detonated by static electricity, although 
there have been no reports of such incidents, said Detective Bob Graybill, who 
heads the Valley-based Community Effort to Combat Auto Theft, known as CECATS. 
</P>
<P>
 In tests conducted at an auto theft investigators' school operated by the 
LAPD, the bags, when inflated, rocketed up to 70 feet in the air, Detective Gil 
Hetrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it deployed while you had a bottle of soda pop, it would shove it right 
through your face," Hetrick said. "It would be like Mike Tyson hitting you 
right in the face." 
</P>
<P>
 When a motion detector senses the impact of the crash, it detonates a 
gunpowder-chemical charge, creating a cloud of gas that instantly snaps the 
balloon-like bag open. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Treinen, president of Special Devices Inc., a Santa Clarita-based maker of 
the explosive "initiators" that trigger air bag deployment, agreed, saying the 
initiators can cause serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it would blow your arm off, but it would certainly blow a 
finger off if you didn't know what you were doing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Treinen also confirmed that static electricity could, in extreme cases, 
trigger the initiator. Treinen said his company expects to sell about 7 million 
of the devices in this fiscal year, and demand is growing. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say it is next to impossible to find crooked repair shop 
operators and prove that they violated the law by receiving stolen goods. But 
in at least one case, catching the alleged thieves was easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewin was on the trail of a stolen car ring working in the Valley on Dec. 3 
when he noticed three men trying to break into his unmarked police car in the 
parking lot of the Northridge Fashion Center mall. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrested them and later discovered that one of the suspects, Sang Van Tran, 
35, of North Hills, was the same man he was looking for in connection with the 
theft of five cars that had been resold to unwitting victims after their 
vehicle identification numbers were altered. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his arrest, Tran had an air bag, also thought to be stolen, 
Lewin said. Lewin matched the serial number of the air bag with the vehicle 
identification number of a car that had been burglarized at a Metrolink parking 
lot in the West Valley, one of a dozen from which air bags had been stolen. 
Tran, who has been charged with nearly a dozen crimes in two separate cases, is 
awaiting trial in Los Angeles Superior Court, Lewin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in Arlington, Va., reports that 91% 
of all 1994 vehicle models are equipped with air bags, according to the 
Automobile Club of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of high profit margins and such a large market will continue to 
drive up air bag thefts, said Goldstein and Detective J.R. Rolfe, an auto theft 
investigator at the Police Department's Devonshire Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's in a car and has some value, someone will try and take it," Rolfe 
said.

TEAMSTERS STRIKE SHUTS DOWN 22 TRUCKING FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first nationwide trucking strike in 15 years, the Teamsters shut down 
22 large trucking companies Wednesday, forcing customers to scramble for 
available carriers and raising fears of serious disruptions to commerce if the 
walkout continues. 
</P>
<P>
 With no new labor negotiations scheduled, about 75,000 Teamsters across the 
country walked picket lines outside truck terminals in one of the largest 
strikes since the mid-1980s. There were only a few reports of scattered, minor 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial impact was minimal for businesses, but many factories and retail 
stores -- many of which have adopted a policy of keeping lean inventories in 
recent years -- could be vulnerable to shortages if the strike lasts a week or 
more, transportation observers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get into Week 2, inventories start to get drawn down and things start 
to get serious," said Douglas Rockel, a trucking industry analyst at Merrill 
Lynch Research. "After two weeks' time, we could start to see shortages and 
prices might be increased." 
</P>
<P>
 The 22 firms paralyzed by the strike move about 18% of the nation's total 
freight. However, they transport about half of all mid-size shipments over long 
distances. Nearly every Fortune 500 company and countless smaller firms rely on 
the companies to deliver everything from auto parts to computers, clothing and 
home appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 But the firms move little in the way of food shipments, which are transported 
primarily by non-union companies or store-owned fleets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not making any pickups in the country today," said Kathy Finlen, a 
spokeswoman for Overland Park, Kan.-based Yellow Freight System, the largest of 
nation's so-called less-than-truckload carriers, which move shipments primarily 
of 10,000 pounds or less. 
</P>
<P>
 CF Motor Freight of Menlo Park, Calif., said its 500 truck terminals 
nationwide were closed after its nearly 19,000 Teamster workers walked off 
their jobs. But a non-union sister company, Con-Way Transportation Services, 
remained open, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the majority of the nation's trucking companies, which are not 
covered by the Teamster contract, and independent truckers remained open 
Wednesday and reported a stream of new customers seeking available space. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are getting a tremendous influx of additional freight volume," said Jeff 
Jordan, a spokesman for Overnite Transportation, a large non-union trucking 
company with headquarters in Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan said the company will put workers on overtime and run its trucks to 
handle the additional orders, but some shipments may have to wait. "We are at 
or near capacity in most places." 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, competing firms can handle only a small portion of the freight 
handled by the 22 firms. United Parcel Service, for example, is prepared to 
handle more business but can move shipments of only 150 pounds or less, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks broke off last week between the International Brotherhood of Teamsters 
and Trucking Management Inc., which represents the trucking firms in labor 
negotiations, after the union rejected what the companies described as their 
last offer. The Teamsters said company proposals to allow greater use of 
part-time workers and railroads would eventually lead to lower starting pay and 
job losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The unionized companies, which face stiff competition from fast-growing 
non-union firms with lower costs, say the proposals are necessary to ensure 
their long-term survival. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Trucking Management agreed to let many of its smaller members 
sign interim agreements with the Teamsters to allow them to continue operating 
during the strike. Those firms, which operate primarily on the East Coast and 
employ about 10,000 Teamsters, would adopt the terms of a contract when one is 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, which is home to an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 union 
members affected by the strike, Teamster picket lines formed outside about 100 
terminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Sympathetic drivers honked their truck and car horns as they passed about 25 
strikers peacefully walking a picket line in front of the Yellow Freight System 
and CF terminals on East Washington Boulevard in Los Angeles early Wednesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Management proposals to hire more part-time workers seemed to be the strongest 
factor prompting the Teamsters to picket. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just want to increase their profits and turn this into a part-time 
industry," said Zack Lopez, a local driver for Yellow who has been hauling 
freight for the company for 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pacoima, Teamster Kelly Price worried about the strike's impact on his 
family. Price and his wife, Annette, are expecting their third child. He said a 
long strike would hurt his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have to dip into our savings, but that would last for about two 
months," said Price, who was picketing in front of Roadway Express Inc. "But I 
will not cross the picket line." 
</P>
<P>
 The first day of the strike found many companies shifting to other carriers to 
avoid disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The potential for a negative impact on inventory increases the longer the 
strike lasts," said Laura Melillo, spokeswoman for R. H. Macy & Co., operator 
of the Bullock's and I. Magnin chains. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy, like many other retailers, has a lean inventory system, which gives 
store operators the flexibility to quickly change product mix. However, 
anticipating a possible strike, Macy ordered and received much of its spring 
line of clothing earlier than usual, Melillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, was also prepared for the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company had selected alternative carriers as backups for the small 
percentage of our carriers who are Teamsters," said Jane Arend, a Wal-Mart 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Operations at the nation's Big Three auto manufacturers, while not immediately 
affected by the walkout, could be disrupted if the strike lasts beyond this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons: Auto makers increasingly depend on outside suppliers for parts 
and components; they are using just-in-time inventory controls that reduce 
manufacturing costs but leave plants with few spare parts, and high demand for 
cars and trucks has plants operating at capacity, using parts on hand quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler Corp. could be the most vulnerable to a prolonged Teamster walkout 
because it relies on outside suppliers for 70% of its parts. Its factories are 
running full tilt to meet the record demand for its vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking at some alternatives to deal with a strike of short duration," 
Chrysler spokesman Lee Sechler said. 
</P>
<P>
 A trucking strike in 1979, when the Teamsters were far more powerful, ended up 
crippling the auto industry with a walkout-turned-lockout that lasted 10 days. 
The cutoff in freight service prompted General Motors to lay off 12,400 
workers. The Chrysler Corp. shut down almost completely. 
</P>
<P>
 The 300,000 truck drivers and warehouse workers affected by that dispute went 
back to work after a settlement was reached providing 30% increases in wages 
and benefits over three years. 
</P>

Angeles, Chau Lam in the San Fernando Valley and Donald Nauss in Detroit

CLINTON PRAISES BLACKMUN FOR PURSUIT OF JUSTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton lauded retiring Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
Wednesday as a man whose "identification was firmly and decisively with the 
ordinary people of this country," while White House aides pondered whether the 
President's legislative agenda would be derailed by putting Senate Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell on the high court. 
</P>
<P>
 In a White House ceremony, Clinton thanked Blackmun for 24 years of service on 
the court, praising him for his "humanity" and sense of justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Justice has not only been his title, it has been his guiding light," Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackmun's friends often have cited his sense of justice and fairness as his 
strengths on the court. His critics have accused him at times of putting those 
values ahead of the strict requirements of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackmun, 85, said of his time on the federal bench: "It hasn't been much fun 
on most occasions, but it's a fantastic experience which few lawyers are 
privileged to have. It's not easy to step aside. But I know what the numbers 
are and it's time." 
</P>
<P>
 Saying that "today should be Justice Blackmun's day," Clinton declined to say 
much publicly about the process of choosing a successor, telling reporters only 
that "I will attempt to appoint someone of genuine stature and largeness of 
ability and spirit to the court." 
</P>
<P>
 In a briefing for reporters, White House Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler said that the 
process would take "a matter of weeks" as aides pore over the records of 
potential candidates to ensure that they contain none of the sort of unpleasant 
surprises that have upended some other Clinton nominees. 
</P>
<P>
 While that process may take a while, aides left no doubt that it will focus, 
at least initially, on Mitchell. The Maine Democrat, 60, is a former federal 
judge. He recently announced his retirement from the Senate this year. 
</P>
<P>
 As he spoke, Cutler had in hand a memo prepared by his aides that covered in 
detail the precedents for appointing a sitting senator to the court. There have 
been seven such appointments in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sen. Mitchell is certainly one of the people on whom we're doing research," 
Cutler said, although he insisted that other candidates will be considered, a 
step that recent history would suggest is prudent. Many early front-runners for 
top Clinton Administration posts have seen their prospects wither following 
scrutiny of their employment practices or published writings or after personal 
discussions with the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Among others Administration officials indicated are most likely to get a look 
are U.S. District Judge Jose A. Cabranes of Connecticut, a former general 
counsel of Yale University, where Clinton went to law school; and Interior 
Secretary Bruce Babbitt, whom Clinton passed over last year in favor of his 
eventual nominee, Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other candidates seem possible but less likely, including U.S. Appeals 
Court Judges Stephen Breyer of Massachusetts and Richard S. Arnold of Arkansas, 
both of whom Clinton considered last year, and Solicitor General Drew S. Days 
III, who is one of the Administration's highest ranking black officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, environmentalists who were fans of Babbitt objected to his 
nomination, fearing that they would lose a champion. This year, many of the 
same environmental advocates have soured on Babbitt and might be happy to see 
him move but their change of heart may have come too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt told reporters Wednesday that now is "not the time to be making a 
move" because of the many environmental issues facing the Administration. 
Senior Administration officials said that he would be considered anyway but 
noted that the concern Babbitt raised could be persuasive for Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, questioned by reporters near his home in Maine, offered a 
characteristically laconic response. "Nothing has been offered to me, so I have 
nothing to consider at this time," he said. If offered the job, "I will 
consider it, as I will consider any option that is presented to me." 
</P>
<P>
 But White House aides left no doubt that they believe Mitchell would like the 
job and that Clinton has great enthusiasm for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President thinks he would be a tremendous choice, of course," said one 
top aide, cautioning only that he is not necessarily the only one. Mitchell 
meets Clinton's desire to appoint people to the court who have substantial 
experience with the problems of the real world outside the courtroom, aides 
noted, adding that he also could provide leadership in consolidating a centrist 
bloc on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, as a sitting senator, Mitchell almost certainly could win easy 
confirmation. Wednesday, the prospect of his nomination drew praise from 
Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill, with only conservative Rep. Dick 
Armey (R-Tex.) sounding a dissenting note. Appointing Mitchell, said Armey, 
would be "politicizing the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Richard Nixon Administration, appointees to the high court have 
tended to be relatively obscure federal judges. But throughout the nation's 
history up to that time, many justices were former U.S. senators, Cabinet 
officers and governors, and one, William Howard Taft, had been President. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, appointing Mitchell could pose a serious problem for Clinton 
because of his central position in moving Clinton's legislative program through 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell serves several roles: in addition to being majority leader, he is on 
the Finance Committee, where he is considered a stabilizing force against its 
quirky chairman, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.). Both in the White House 
and on Capitol Hill, he is considered an indispensable participant in the 
process of putting together a health reform bill -- Clinton's top priority for 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking Mitchell out "would decapitate the Senate," one Democratic 
congressional aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the court's next term is not scheduled to begin until Oct. 
3 and Blackmun's resignation does not take effect until Sept. 25 -- only days 
before the Senate is scheduled to recess for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Legally, no reason exists why Mitchell could not serve in the Senate at least 
until then, officials said. During the Jimmy Carter Administration, Cutler 
noted, then-Rep. Abner Mikva served as a member of the House for months between 
his nomination and his confirmation to a seat on the federal appeals court 
here. Under current Senate procedures, a confirmation takes a minimum of 10 to 
12 weeks from the date a nomination is made. 
</P>
<P>
 And while some officials argued that the confirmation process inevitably would 
distract Mitchell too much from the health care bill and other Senate business, 
other congressional and Administration officials said that they see no reason 
Mitchell could not handle both. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the President believes Sen. Mitchell is the best person to put on the 
court, the rest of this stuff can get worked out," said a senior White House 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 One technical problem exists -- the Constitution forbids appointing a member 
of Congress to a federal job for which the salary has increased during that 
member's congressional term. Because of that, Congress would have to pass 
special legislation temporarily lowering the salary for the vacancy before 
Mitchell could take the job, a step taken last year to allow former Sen. Lloyd 
Bentsen to become secretary of the Treasury.

MEXICO JUSTICE SYSTEM FUELS DOUBT ABOUT ASSASSINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING and SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Soon after ruling party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was 
assassinated in Tijuana last month, the chief suspect was jailed, along with 
four alleged co-conspirators. At first glance, authorities here appeared to be 
off on a rapid execution of justice. 
</P>
<P>
 But far from finding reassurance in the swift investigation of this country's 
most shocking political murder in more than half a century, Mexicans are 
growing increasingly suspicious and uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem, experts say, is inherent in Mexico's criminal justice 
system. It emphasizes the largely private exchange of file folders of evidence 
and transcripts rather than allowing for lawyers' arguments and the 
cross-examination of witnesses in public trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, few Mexicans understand the workings of their bureaucratic 
system, which has its roots in this nation's time under Spanish conquest and 
colonization and has been tainted with widespread accusations of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 And the special twists of the Colosio investigation -- which critics say has 
become politicized and is far too secretive -- have shown Mexico's criminal 
justice system in the least favorable light, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge in this case has a historic opportunity to show what a Mexican 
tribunal is capable of doing," said one noted defense lawyer. But "that 
opportunity has been diminished by a series of lamentable errors." 
</P>
<P>
 Many legal sources interviewed declined to be identified because they may 
handle matters in the future before key figures now handling the Colosio case: 
Alejandro Sosa, the judge who is presiding over the suspects' trials, and 
Miguel Montes, the Supreme Court justice who has been appointed the special 
prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal experts noted that in the Mexican system -- in sharp contrast to its 
U.S. counterpart -- judges have considerable discretion and power. And while 
lawyers here do not challenge jurists publicly, privately they are joining 
human rights activists and other Mexicans in criticizing aspects of the 
assassination investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the special prosecutor has been far too inaccessible; he has 
provided his information, thus far, via videotaped messages sent to television 
networks and via press releases distributed by the president's press office to 
print media. 
</P>
<P>
 Families of those arrested also complain that suspects are being kidnaped and 
are disappearing from Tijuana only to appear days later in custody in Mexico 
City. Meantime, this nation has been swept with wild rumors in which witnesses 
have been confused with suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 But legal sources here expressed their gravest doubts about fairness issues in 
this case when considering restrictions placed on public access to the 
suspects' trials. For security reasons, authorities have announced that the 
trials will be conducted in a fortress-like prison near the capital. 
Journalists have been allowed into the courtroom and have reported on the 
proceedings there in detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers argue, however, that that is insufficient. "The trial should be public 
because that is what the law demands," said one lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if it is in a more open site, analysts here note, a Mexican court -- even 
when considering a case as astonishing as the Colosio assassination -- offers 
far less drama than does its American or British counterpart because of its 
paper-heavy procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 A Mexican trial begins when the prosecutor presents the judge with evidence 
that a crime has been committed and names the suspect. The judge considers the 
evidence and decides whether a trial is merited; if so, he decides whether the 
accused should be released on bail or detained. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the United States, the suspect is innocent until proven guilty. But 
beyond that rudimentary concept, the U.S. and Mexican systems have almost 
nothing in common. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, for example, the victim's family gets a voice in a criminal trial 
and enjoys a status equal to that of the prosecutor, the defense lawyer or the 
accused. 
</P>
<P>
 If a trial is merited, the Mexican judge independently decides what evidence 
presented by the prosecutor is pertinent to the case and discards the rest. 
Each side then presents "proofs," usually testimony. This phase of the trial 
can take up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge in Mexico decides when sufficient proof has been presented and 
closes the case, telling prosecutors to present written conclusions. It is only 
when these conclusions are presented that a suspect is formally charged with 
the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense then rebuts the prosecution -- also in writing. The judge then 
decides the suspect's guilt or innocence and hands down a sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Either side can present appeals at the end of any phase of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 This "is a system that has the few virtues and all of the defects of the 
archaic colonial system," said one lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal justice system is one of Mexico's major problems, Ernesto 
Zedillo, Colosio's successor, conceded in his first television interview as the 
new ruling party presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must recognize the vices, failures and deficiencies evident in our 
country's justice system," he said, calling for a thorough revision of it, from 
the police to the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it comes to handling the Colosio case, the government and the ruling 
party have done anything but engage in more open, reformist conduct, critics 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 They note, for example, that Montes is a loyal member of the ruling party who 
was head of the Mexican Congress when it certified the controversial 1988 
presidential election. Further, though now responsible for a huge criminal 
case, he lacks a significant background in such matters. He was district 
attorney of Mexico City for only about 1 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 And as for his reputation as a justice, one lawyer quipped, "Let's just say 
he's not Earl Warren," referring to the highly respected chief justice of the 
U.S. Supreme Court who conducted the much-criticized, but highly public 
investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides complaining about the furtiveness of the special prosecutor and his 
failure to provide detailed information, relatives of the accused have 
complained bitterly about the secretive methods of his federal investigators. 
For example, they accuse the investigators of holding the suspects 
incommunicado for days. 
</P>
<P>
 The human rights ombudsman in Baja California has filed a formal complaint 
against the federal government on behalf of the family of Vicente Mayoral 
Valenzuela, a former state police commander accused of aiding the assassin, and 
his son Rodolfo, both members of the security detail in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as we are concerned, it was a kidnaping by the government," said 
Gerardo Becerra, Mayoral's son-in law, in an interview Monday. "We heard about 
their arrests through the press. The authorities haven't even told us where 
they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Darling reported from Mexico City and Rotella from Tijuana.

AMES MAY AID PROBE IF WIFE IS GIVEN LENIENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW and ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the CIA and FBI determined to learn whether Aldrich H. Ames had 
confederates inside the intelligence agency, the accused spy is showing his 
first willingness to cooperate with investigators -- but only if they recommend 
leniency for his wife, The Times learned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames has virtually no chance of negotiating leniency for himself, however, 
considering the damage investigators believe the 31-year CIA veteran caused to 
American intelligence interests and his possible complicity in the deaths of 
U.S. intelligence operatives in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames, 52, and his Colombian-born wife, Rosario, 41, were arrested on espionage 
conspiracy charges on Feb. 21. The deadline for a grand jury indictment, 
typically 30 days after an arrest, was extended an additional 30 days to give 
defense attorneys time to examine the voluminous documents recovered by the FBI 
in searches of Ames' home and CIA office. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames allegedly was paid at least $2.5 million by the Soviets and later the 
Russians to spy for them since 1985 -- an amount that the FBI has characterized 
as extraordinary in intelligence circles. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are intent on putting Ames in prison for life, according to 
sources close to the case. But the prospect of a possible deal for Mrs. Ames is 
more complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been suffering emotional distress since her incarceration, a factor 
said to be adding to Ames' desire to strike a deal for her. Sources said that 
she is being seen by a Washington psychologist, whose employment was approved 
Monday by U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton sealed the motion seeking appointment of the psychologist, A. John 
Kalil. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief interview, Kalil acknowledged that he has been assigned to assess 
Mrs. Ames' condition. Asked whether her distress was related to her 5-year-old 
son, Paul, who was sent to Colombia to stay with his maternal grandmother, 
Kalil said: "In a sense, it is." 
</P>
<P>
 But he declined to elaborate, saying that he was "not at liberty to discuss" 
his assignment and was "reticent to even converse" about the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials must weigh whether they can justify allowing Mrs. Ames to 
go free after some period of imprisonment if, in return, they obtain Ames' 
firsthand insight into who else in the CIA -- if anyone -- may have helped him 
carry out the alleged espionage and the degree to which it may have compromised 
some still-existing intelligence operations overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames' cooperation would help intelligence officials conduct a detailed damage 
assessment, which they regard as critical. A plea agreement with Ames also 
would avoid a public trial that could expose U.S. intelligence sources and 
methods. 
</P>
<P>
 Plato Cacheris, Ames' attorney, declined comment on any discussions with U.S. 
officials. He said that he is "tooling up" to try the case in court because 
"there are a lot of challenging legal issues here." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these issues could complicate the government's effort to bring Ames to 
trial, legal sources said. Among them, Cacheris said, was the use of a search 
warrant against Ames before his arrest. It was authorized by Atty. Gen. Janet 
Reno, who bypassed normal federal court approval for such a warrant and 
depended instead on the authority of an executive order on national security 
that dates from the Ronald Reagan Administration. This authority has not been 
tested in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Other legal questions have arisen, he said, over the FBI's seizure of 
documents in Ames' personal computer. The seizure was carried out under the 
authorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which permits 
surveillance of electronic communications. But Ames is likely to contend that 
he was only storing the material in his home computer and did not 
electronically send it anywhere, thus not actually communicating with anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials revealed in court last month that they had found more 
than 100 classified CIA cables on computer diskettes in the Ameses' house, a 
violation of agency regulations against keeping such material at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Because much of the material was outside Ames' jurisdiction at the CIA, 
officials want his cooperation in determining how he obtained it and who, if 
anyone, among his colleagues helped him. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency prides itself on "compartmentation," or granting access to 
information to employees on a need-to-know basis. The apparent breakdown in 
security procedures -- and the effort to determine who was responsible -- is 
the subject of an independent inquiry by the CIA's inspector general, Frederick 
Hitz. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of whether to recommend leniency for Mrs. Ames could be 
influenced by evidence indicating that she was a driving force in persuading 
her husband to participate in espionage. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, telephone conversations overheard by the FBI 
include one in which she cautioned him against carelessness in carrying 
sensitive documents or cash, apparently from his Russian handlers, in suitcases 
that he was checking as airline baggage. 
</P>
<P>
 In another, she berated him, allegedly for failing to leave a timely signal 
for the Russians, saying: "Well, honey, I hope you didn't screw up." 
</P>
<P>
 FBI officials have said in court that after her arrest, Mrs. Ames volunteered 
a series of damaging statements about her husband's receipt of millions of 
dollars from Russia. But they said she stopped cooperating after she was given 
a court-appointed lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorney, William E. Cummings, did not return telephone calls Wednesday. 
But previously he attacked the accuracy of FBI wiretap excerpts depicting her 
as an active participant in a conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department officials declined comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Both defendants could benefit by agreeing to guilty pleas before the grand 
jury returns an indictment. Under the federal sentencing guidelines, judges can 
take into consideration all counts with which a defendant is charged. 
</P>
<P>
 A plea bargain before indictment could permit the defendants to plead guilty 
to less-sweeping charges.

NEWS ANALYSIS; WILSON GETS MILEAGE OUT OF REBUILT FREEWAY; POLITICS: GOVERNOR 
GRABS GLORY FOR FAST WORK ON THE SANTA MONICA. BUT HE ANGERS DEMOCRATS WHO WERE 
CENTRAL TO THE EFFORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The early reopening of the Santa Monica Freeway next week will fit neatly into 
Gov. Pete Wilson's reelection strategy as he strives to replace the negative 
image many voters have of him with one of a tough and competent can-do leader. 
</P>
<P>
 But a hastily called televised news conference in which the Republican 
governor announced the reopening left a bitter taste among Democrats, 
particularly those in Washington whose help made the quick freeway 
reconstruction possible. 
</P>
<P>
 One prominent Democratic assemblyman is questioning whether the Wilson 
Administration deliberately overestimated the time it would take to fix the 
Santa Monica Freeway so that the governor could triumphantly celebrate the 
project's supposedly early completion. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials are grumbling that Wilson, who never misses a 
chance to complain about what he says is a weak federal commitment to 
California, is now trying to hog the credit for a project that was financed 
entirely by federal tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the earthquake repairs will probably be only background music in a 
campaign where the main note is the condition of the state's economy. But an 
incumbent running 5 to 10 points behind in the polls looks for every 
opportunity to improve his standing, and Wilson did just that at Tuesday's news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something we can point to with pride," said Joe Shumate, a top Wilson 
campaign strategist. "It fits into what we have been saying about the governor, 
that he is a problem-solver who has the ability to get things done." 
</P>
<P>
 Shumate said the campaign is not producing commercials using footage of Wilson 
disclosing plans to reopen the nation's busiest freeway. But he added: 
"Anything's possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's appearance at the freeway was one of a series of events orchestrated 
by the governor's office and the campaign to persuade voters that Wilson is 
responsible for some of the things that are going well for California. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign's theory is that once an uninformed electorate is told what 
Wilson has been doing for them, voters will change their view of his 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of tremendous things have been accomplished over the last three years, 
and they've been accomplished because of Pete Wilson and his hard work," said 
Dan Schnur, Wilson's campaign communications director. "On a lot of occasions, 
those achievements have been overshadowed by other breaking news events. So 
part of our job at the campaign is to remind the people of California about 
those achievements." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a Los Angeles Times poll last month found that 70% of those surveyed 
believe Caltrans is doing a good job protecting the freeways from earthquake 
damage, an exceptionally high rating for a much-maligned bureaucracy that never 
has been seen as a model of efficiency. Wilson's task is to remind people that 
he is the one who directs the bureaucrats who direct Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Democrats are questioning just how much of an achievement the Santa 
Monica Freeway job was, and others are casting doubt on Wilson's role in it. 
</P>
<P>
 The reconstruction of the two downed overpasses is due to be completed 74 days 
ahead of schedule. The firm that rebuilt the structures stands to earn a bonus 
of $200,000 for every day the job is done early, or more than $14.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), chairman of the Assembly Transportation 
Committee, suggests that Caltrans may have deliberately estimated a lengthy 
construction period, knowing the project could be completed sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either the Department of Transportation is wildly incompetent when it comes 
to project management, or somebody is playing games, because the contractor was 
able to do this in half the time allotted by Caltrans and pocket a nice little 
sum in the process," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials, meanwhile, were angered by the governor's 
news conference Tuesday, in which Wilson appeared to be taking all the credit 
for the reconstruction job. Although another event planned for next week will 
include federal officials, the reopening will be old news by then. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's snubbing of Clinton was all the more galling to the White House 
because Wilson has been complaining for more than a year that the federal 
government is doing too little to assist California. 
</P>
<P>
 John Emerson, a White House aide who coordinated the federal earthquake 
response for Clinton, said it was the President who prompted state and federal 
officials to speed up the reconstruction timeline. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson said Clinton, when told by Caltrans officials in January that the 
projects might take as long as a year, immediately ordered Secretary of 
Transportation Federico Pena to work with Caltrans to "come up with whatever 
creative means we could come up with to try to speed up the process." News 
accounts from the time support Emerson's version of events. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were able to get this completed and get it completed without costing 
California taxpayers a dime," Emerson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Clinton Administration official was a little more emphatic when asked 
to comment on Wilson's Tuesday news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he did was grotesque," said the official, who asked not to be 
identified. "This has been a partnership every step of the way. For him to jump 
out (and take credit) was very unfair and highly political and we're unhappy 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Goodman, Wilson's communications director, said the Democratic 
criticism of Wilson was unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "We welcome the federal assistance and we welcome the increased tourism by 
Clinton Administration officials to the state," she said. "But even they know 
that ultimately the delivery of services to the state is a state 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson made the announcement Tuesday afternoon, she said, because engineers 
determined Tuesday morning that the project would be done much sooner than had 
been expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we set deadlines and miss them we get criticized for missing them," 
Goodman said. "When we set deadlines and announce that we're meeting them 
early, we get criticized for hogging the spotlight. It's damned if we do and 
damned if we don't." 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of insider backbiting, however vitriolic, is unlikely to have much 
impact on the California governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters tend to expect government to get the job done, and they don't give much 
credit -- to anyone -- when that happens. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the governor's advisers recognize that Wilson all along faced a larger 
downside risk, because voters angry over a delayed reconstruction effort might 
take it out on him at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's Democratic opponents say the early opening of the Santa Monica 
Freeway merely emphasizes the governor's lack of accomplishments earlier in his 
term. "He remains extremely vulnerable to the charge that he acts only in the 
pressure of an election campaign," said Michael Reese, spokesman for Kathleen 
Brown. "Otherwise he dallies and stalls." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Wilson aides concede that any boost the governor gets will be 
short-lived. By November, voters' attention will have turned to other matters, 
particularly their own economic well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something that happens in the summer or before -- that helps temporarily, but 
I'm not sure it has a long-term effect for the governor," Shumate said.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: JAMES BRADY OUT TO DISARM ROBERTI FOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been 13 years and one week since James Brady's life was changed forever 
by a handgun during the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like it was only yesterday," a woman comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels like it's been a century," Brady responds. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady sits in a wheelchair, wearing leg braces with a cane at his side. 
</P>
<P>
 But his is a happy story, given the first few chapters. I saw Brady being 
wheeled off to George Washington University Hospital that traumatic, rainy day 
and, like most people there, wouldn't have bet two cents on his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, for a long time, we wouldn't have bet on his having much of a meaningful 
life. It was almost impossible for the President's former spokesman to complete 
more than a sentence or two without his voice rising into a squeal that sounded 
like laughter, or crying, but actually was an uncontrollable reflex caused by 
the bullet damage to his brain. Memory and concentration suffered too. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brady is one of those scrappy, instinctively upbeat, "glass half full" 
people who never surrenders. He also is blessed with an inspirational wife, 
Sarah -- "the raccoon," he calls her -- and a support group of longtime 
admirers. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, he has been sustained, indeed enhanced, by fighting for causes -- 
for people with disabilities and, especially, for gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guns is a cause I can relate to," he notes. "I'm the real item." 
</P>
<P>
 And on this night, Brady is in the San Fernando Valley fighting for state Sen. 
David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys), who next Tuesday faces a recall election 
marshaled by the gun zealots. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti was being forced out of the Senate anyway by term limits next 
December. But firearms worshipers -- a small minority of society, but 
uncompromising and unforgiving -- decided to repay the veteran lawmaker for 
sponsoring a 1989 bill that banned semiautomatic assault weapons. At the same 
time, they would send a message to other elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our message to political pigs: 'Slight us at your peril,' " wrote recall 
spokesman Russ Howard in a 1993 confidential memo to the National Rifle Assn. 
The long memo, laying out the recall movement's goals and strategy, was leaked 
to Roberti by a mole and has become invaluable in his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may not win a particular election, but our methods have an extremely 
efficient 'political cost exchange ratio' making it exceedingly expensive, 
difficult and unpleasant for the target to remain in office," the memo reads. 
"Victory springs from imparting excruciating political pain in unrelenting 
repetitive attacks on a single politician as an example to others. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The memo concludes: "This won't be the last recall we will do. . . . We can 
certainly put the fear of God into state-level judges. . . . We are already 
investigating a potential judicial target." 
</P>
<P>
 So this recall movement is less about Roberti than it is about intimidating 
public officials who might support gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brady and Roberti are at the senator's campaign headquarters in North 
Hollywood. The former presidential press secretary is urging about 50 
volunteers to "get out the vote. . . . Flood the telephone lines and knock on 
every door. We must send the message loudly and clearly to the assault weapons 
extremists that we will no longer tolerate these weapons of war in our 
society." 
</P>
<P>
 Brady is reading slowly in a monotone, but there is no mistaking his passion. 
Later he tells me, referring to the NRA and its allies, "You can't reason with 
them. And they believe in taking no prisoners. . . . They can't get any 
meaner." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen years after the barrage of .22-caliber bullets and thousands of 
therapy sessions later, Brady can carry on a normal conversation. His voice is 
steady. We sit for awhile, talking about mutual friends, former White House 
staffers and Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hope I'm not telling stories out of school," he says, then gleefully tells 
about once buying TV time to run a commercial showing Reagan endorsing the 
Brady Bill, requiring a national five-day wait for purchase of a handgun. The 
ad was spotted only in San Antonio, where the NRA was holding its convention, 
and at a time delegates most likely would be watching their TV sets. "They must 
have gone ballistic," Brady says. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how bitter he is about his wounds, Brady says: "I've tried to put that 
behind me. And I've been fairly successful. I wouldn't say I'm in denial. But 
I'm picking up on positive causes -- like returning Sen. Roberti to Sacramento. 
You put the bad stuff behind you and turn the pages." 
</P>
<P>
 The zealots would be better off today if 13 years ago there'd been enough gun

never understand that.

ANDRE TCHELISTCHEFF, MASTER WINEMAKER, DIES; ENOLOGY: HE IS CREDITED WITH 
REVIVING THE INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA AND STRONGLY INFLUENCING ITS GROWTH. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Andre Tchelistcheff, America's pioneer maker of fine wines who helped dozens 
of wineries get their start, has died in the Napa Valley. He was 92. 
</P>
<P>
 Tchelistcheff, who had worked a full schedule until recently, died Tuesday at 
Queen of Valley Hospital in Napa. He was found to have cancer of the esophagus 
three months ago and underwent surgery last week for removal of a stomach 
tumor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian-born, French-trained Tchelistcheff, along with Maynard Amerine of 
UC Davis, is credited with making the greatest strides in bringing California 
winemakers back from Prohibition, which nearly wiped out a wine industry that 
today contributes billions of dollars to the state's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word 'visionary' really applies to Andre," said John De Luca, president 
of the San Francisco-based Wine Institute, which represents the industry. "He 
added immensely to wine's image as more than just a family beverage and one of 
the great pleasures of life, but also as part of culture. He was never 
pretentious and gave us all a sense of how simple and yet sublime wine was to 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Tchelistcheff arrived in California from France in 1938, 4 1/2 years after the 
end of Prohibition, to become winemaker at Beaulieu Vineyard in the Napa 
Valley. He found an industry in disarray, lacking understanding of fine wine 
production. Immediately, he and the 27-year-old Amerine pooled their talents to 
educate California winemakers in such then-arcane subjects as viticulture, 
fermentation science and winery sanitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his contributions to winemaking were the reduced use of sulfur dioxide 
in wine production, pioneering use of cold fermentation to retain fruit 
quality, the use of fining agents to make clear wine and the development of 
methods to control red wine fermentation. All are now routinely used around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Tchelistcheff's greatest contributions was in the area of sensory 
evaluation. He developed standards for classical wines that are used today by 
hundreds of winemakers in many states, and he spoke at wine symposiums in 
Europe, where he was highly respected. 
</P>
<P>
 Tchelistcheff felt that his greatest contribution was in bridging the gap that 
had existed between grape growing and winemaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "The winemaker should be living much closer to the wine grower," he said. 
"Before, enology and viticulture had been separated." 
</P>
<P>
 He was a powerful influence in matching the grape varieties to the proper 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 The dynamic Tchelistcheff, a diminutive man who seemingly never tired, worked 
at Beaulieu through 1971 with the title of vice president. He left to go into 
what he called semi-retirement. But the move merely fueled a second career -- 
consulting for other wineries. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his winery clients were Niebaum-Coppola, Clos Pegase, Conn Creek, 
Staglin and Villa Mount Eden in the Napa Valley; Jordan, Buena Vista (where he 
was also a part owner for decades), Field Stone and Domaine Michel in Sonoma 
County; Firestone in Santa Barbara, and Chateau Ste. Michelle in Washington. He 
also aided his nephew, Alex Golitzin, whose Quilceda Creek Winery outside 
Seattle is one of the top producers of Cabernet Sauvignon in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, Beaulieu rehired Tchelistcheff to assist in fine wine 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Shrem, owner of Clos Pegase, said Tchelistcheff was multitalented: "He 
helped me on every facet of wine -- economics, public relations, education, 
even ethics." 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Davis, winemaker at Jordan Winery, said Tchelistcheff was "learning all 
the time. He was so progressive, even at his age." 
</P>
<P>
 For years Tchelistcheff made his rounds to winery clients in a racy yellow 
sports car, dashing about the Napa Valley's back roads, but after he hurt his 
arm in an accident in 1990 he gave up driving. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, Tchelistcheff, an inveterate smoker, gave up cigarettes. He had 
tried to quit years earlier, but went back to smoking after noting that his 
palate memory had been formed while he was a smoker, and once he quit, wines 
did not taste or smell the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Tchelistcheff could not do anything partway. When Tchelistcheff was nearing 
90, Allen Shoup, president of Chateau Ste. Michelle, asked the master to assist 
in the making of wine at two of his Napa Valley properties, Conn Creek and 
Villa Mt. Eden. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said that to do that job right, he had to climb up on the catwalks and 
taste the wines, every day," said Shoup. "I told him, 'You don't have to do 
that; we have people who will go get the wine samples and bring it down to 
you.' But he said, 'No, you must do it yourself.' And then he accepted the 
jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 The French government honored him in 1954 for bringing French-quality 
winemaking to America. In 1990 he was named "Wine Man of the Year" at the Wine 
Industry Technical Symposium. 
</P>
<P>
 Tchelistcheff is survived by his wife, Dorothy, and a son, Dmitri, a 
consulting winemaker who lives in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services will be at 11 a.m. Monday at St. Mary's Episcopal Church in 
Napa.

WILSON ADVISER SAYS '3 STRIKES' WILL SAVE MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's chief economist predicted Wednesday that the new "three 
strikes and you're out" law will provide five times more in savings than it 
will cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The analysis by economist Phil Romero was immediately assailed by the authors 
of two of the studies cited in Romero's five-page paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero, relying heavily on other studies, said the average criminal commits 20 
crimes annually. He assumes the average yearly cost of crimes committed by each 
criminal is $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rest of it is just arithmetic," Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
 By 2001, an estimated 84,000 prisoners will be serving lengthy sentences under 
the new law. At that time, he said, the state will realize $16.8 billion in 
social benefits and savings -- everything from reduced property loss to lower 
medical bills to less spending on private security. 
</P>
<P>
 In that year, the Department of Corrections estimates, the cost of operating 
and building new prisons will be $2.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even in the beginning, the benefits are at least double the costs," Romero 
said. "As time goes by, as we get over the capital cost hump (for prison 
construction), it goes up even more. . . . Benefits average well over five 
times costs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Corrections estimates that 20 prisons must be built by the 
turn of the century to house criminals sentenced under the "three strikes" law. 
A prison costs about $500 million to build. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero called his analysis "very conservative" and said he was seeking to 
counter critics who say the "three strikes" law will bankrupt the state. Romero 
also said the analysis is intended to buttress Wilson's contention that the 
state cannot afford to allow repeat felons out of prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But Peter Greenwood, a criminal justice specialist at the RAND Corp. and 
author of a key study cited by Romero, disagreed. "I do not in any way, shape 
or form see it as conservative," Greenwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the average out-of-pocket cost for each crime is $1,000 or $2,000. If 
a felon commits 20 crimes a year, the cost is between $20,000 and $40,000 a 
year -- a fraction of the number Romero used. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark A.R. Kleiman, a Harvard professor of public policy and co-author of a 
second study cited by Romero, said Romero is "just plain wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the analysis assumes that every person imprisoned under "three 
strikes" would be committing the same number of crimes at age 60 as at age 20. 
Most crime is committed by younger criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero defended his work, saying that although the average cost of an 
individual crime may be $2,000, murder is the "big cost driver" because a 
murder might cost $2.4 million when the lost wages of the victim are taken into 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited estimates that the cost of a rape in medical treatment, lost wages, 
and pain and suffering is $51,000. Burglary, the most common crime that is 
classified as a serious crime under the "three strikes" law, costs less than 
$1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The "three strikes" law imposes prison sentences of 25 years to life on 
third-time felons who have committed two prior violent or serious felonies, 
ranging from murder and rape to home burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 An initiative that duplicates the "three strikes" legislation qualified for 
the November ballot, acting Secretary of State Tony Miller announced Wednesday. 
Clerks in 43 of California's 58 counties tallied 815,000 signatures for the 
measure. Signatures gathered in Los Angeles County were not even counted. The 
proposition needed 423,000 signatures to qualify for the ballot.

SPEND SETTLEMENT ON SEISMIC WORK, LUNGREN SUGGESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren announced Wednesday that he will recommend that an 
$80-million settlement from an oil industry price fixing case be spent on 
earthquake repairs to highways and the seismic strengthening of vulnerable 
bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren said he will argue before U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima of 
Los Angeles that the upgrading and repair of structures on California's 
financially troubled highway system is the best use for money that seven major 
oil companies owe the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Although several other uses for the money had been proposed by state agencies 
and individuals, Lungren said he decided to recommend the investment in 
highways because it could attract federal money. With some federal programs 
matching state money 10 to 1, he said the $80 million had the potential to grow 
to $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But Caltrans officials said the settlement money is unlikely to attract 
federal matching funds because the state has reached a cap on such assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no additional $800 million. This would only be an additional $80 
million," Caltrans press secretary Jim Drago said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Lungren, Dave Puglia, insisted that the attorney general's 
information about the federal funds had come directly from Caltrans, which 
proposed several weeks ago that the settlement money be used for earthquake 
repairs and bridge retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Drago said there apparently was a misunderstanding between Lungren and 
Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials nonetheless said they would welcome the $80 million from 
the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's highway improvement program is facing a $2-billion shortfall and 
the settlement funds certainly would be needed if a $2-billion quake bond issue 
in June fails to pass. Even if the measure passes, the settlement money will 
allow Caltrans to shift resources to other highway programs. 
</P>
<P>
 At his Wednesday news conference, Lungren said the $80 million was the state's 
share of a $112-million settlement of an antitrust lawsuit brought by 
California, Oregon, Arizona and Washington against seven major oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed nearly 20 years ago, alleged that the companies illegally 
conspired to fix gasoline prices in the 1960s and 1970s. It also accused the 
companies of creating a fake gasoline shortage in the early and mid-1970s to 
justify higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies -- Shell, Exxon, Arco, Chevron, Unocal, Mobil and Texaco -- 
agreed to the settlement in January, 1993, without admitting liability. Lungren 
said the $80 million is expected to available by September. In addition, he 
said his office would be paid an additional $9 million in legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren, who is responsible for recommending how the money will be spent, said 
he also considered using it for a onetime reduction in license plate fees. He 
said he ultimately decided against that because it would have saved motorists 
only about $3 each.

STUDENT'S GUNSHOT PROJECT ALLOWED TO ENTER SCIENCE FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Overturning a screening committee recommendation, the managers of the San 
Diego County science fair decided Wednesday that 12-year-old Russ Grisbeck will 
be allowed to enter his project involving the use of a hunting rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 The screening committee ruled last month that Grisbeck's project might 
encourage other youths to take up firearms, but the full management committee 
decided that Grisbeck's project had been done under safe and scientifically 
valid conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to Disneyland, but I am going to the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory," said the buoyant seventh-grader after the decision. "I'm pretty 
excited. I thought we might have to keep fighting." In addition to his 
invitation to JPL, Grisbeck received a super-scope for his rifle by the scope 
manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 After the screening committee had said the project was not suitable, Russ's 
plight had evoked support from the National Rifle Assn. and Rep. Duncan Hunter 
(R-El Cajon). The NRA urged its members to flood the offices of the Greater San 
Diego Science and Engineering Fair with calls of protest. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair, scheduled April 13-17 in Balboa Park, is sponsored by the San Diego 
Union-Tribune, with support from businesses and science educators. Now in its 
40th year, the fair is expected to draw 600 entries from junior and senior high 
school students. 
</P>
<P>
 Russ, a student at Olive Peirce Middle School in rural Ramona, had used his 
prize Remington hunting rifle to test bullets with five differing amounts of 
gunpowder. His goal was to decide which bullet provided the greatest velocity 
and accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Russ and his father, Irv, who runs a sportfishing business in San Diego, are 
avid hunters and members of the NRA. Russ began firing a .22 when he was 8 
years old and obtained his hunter's safety certificate at age 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of the boy and his rifle caused a media sensation, starting first 
with a radio talk show, then local television news programs and newspapers, 
then the Associated Press, and then national newspapers and television news 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement announcing that the project would be allowed, the science fair 
management committee reiterated the screening committee's concern about 
students being tempted to duplicate Russ's experiment without proper concern 
for safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was given a grade of A by Russ's science teacher, who then 
nominated it for the science fair. The project display will include charts and 
graphs to show the boy's calculations and conclusions, but not the rifle.

COASTAL PANEL ASKED TO OK NAVY GUN TESTS; ENVIRONMENT: WEAPON WOULD BE FIRED ON 
SAN NICOLAS ISLAND. DESPITE PRECAUTIONS, THERE IS A REMOTE CHANCE THAT SEA LIFE 
MIGHT BE HARMED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Navy is seeking permission from the California Coastal Commission to 
test-fire a sophisticated Gatling gun on San Nicolas Island near areas teeming 
with seals, sea lions and marine birds. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal comes just weeks after the Navy incurred the wrath of 
environmental activists with a plan to detonate underwater explosives to test 
the strength of ship hulls 20 miles away.That testing, which has been 
temporarily delayed, is expected to kill or injure a small number of marine 
mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new proposal, the Navy wants to test an updated version of its 
Vulcan Phalanx Gatling gun on a point at Navy-owned San Nicolas, which is about 
70 miles off the Ventura County coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials say the test -- to be conducted in May and June if approved by 
the commission -- will be carried out in an area where a minimum of sea life is 
found. Shots fired from the island will be directed at incoming test targets, 
and those that miss are expected to land harmlessly 6,000 feet offshore, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the officials acknowledged that the test zone lies between two areas 
on the island where an abundance of marine mammals and birds are located, 
including the endangered southern sea otter and the California brown pelican. 
Those animals could be affected by noise, and there is a remote possibility 
that creatures offshore could be hit. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, however, Navy officials insisted the tests were safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal will go before the Coastal Commission on Tuesday. Commission 
staff members said they were at first very concerned by the tests but have 
since been convinced that through the safety precautions the Navy intends, they 
will be safely conducted without harm to wildlife.

BOSNIAN SERBS OFFER TRUCE TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs proposed talks on a broad truce with the Muslim-led government 
Wednesday after stopping the U.N. commander from going to the embattled Gorazde 
enclave. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials said they hoped to begin negotiations today at Sarajevo's 
airport on a cease-fire covering all of the former Yugoslav republic.There was 
no immediate comment from government leaders on the proposed talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian troops and the government army have mostly observed a truce around 
Sarajevo since Feb. 10, but fighting has raged between them elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate cease-fire between Bosnia's Croats and Muslims, whose leaders are 
forming a federation, has quieted central and southwestern Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, the U.N. commander for Bosnia, had wanted to 
personally assess reports that Gorazde was about to fall to the Serbs after a 
nine-day offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor of Gorazde had pleaded for Rose to come, just as Rose's predecessor, 
French Gen. Philippe Morillon, went to the enclave of Srebrenica during 
fighting a year ago. Muslims believe Morillon's trip saved Srebrenica. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian authorities blocked Rose from getting beyond Pale, the Bosnian Serb 
headquarters just outside Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 They did, however, allow three U.N. military observers and eight of Rose's 
liaison officers to go on to supplement four military observers already in the 
enclave about 30 miles southeast of Sarajevo.

BLACK WOMEN THROW LIFELINE TO THEIR SISTERS; NASHVILLE PROGRAM RECRUITS 
RECOVERING ADDICTS TO HELP THOSE STILL MIRED IN DRUG ABUSE AT PUBLIC HOUSING 
PROJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Belting out songs in a popular downtown jazz club, Regina McCrary-Bond is the 
embodiment of sassy confidence and glamour. 
</P>
<P>
 No one would guess the depths from which she had climbed to get there. Seven 
years ago McCrary-Bond, the daughter of a Baptist preacher, a former backup 
singer to Bob Dylan, a woman of early bright musical promise, had hit rock 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 After five years of touring with a music legend, she couldn't find work when 
she came home to Nashville to care for her young son. Depressed and dejected, 
she was sucked into a degrading spiral of crack addiction that siphoned her 
self-esteem, ransacked her savings and left her at the brink of suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found myself losing all my morals," she said. "Things that people say they 
wouldn't do for money and drugs, I found myself doing it. I realized that I was 
like in hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the relative height from which she fell, McCrary-Bond's story is a 
common one -- especially in public housing developments where, social workers 
say, women are falling prey to drug addiction in ever higher numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 But an innovative program is helping to stop the dangerous trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Started in 1991 at the Meharry Medical College Community Mental Health Center 
by drug counselors frustrated over their lack of success in treating 
drug-addicted black women, the federally funded SISTER program has spawned 
imitators in several cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would see white men coming to treatment, black men coming to treatment, 
white women coming for treatment, but very few black women coming to 
treatment," said program director Darlene Fowler, who was director of Meharry's 
residential rehabilitation unit. 
</P>
<P>
 SISTER targets black female public housing residents by using as counselors 
women who share their background and culture. Operating in seven Nashville 
housing developments, the program pairs counselors with recovering addicts. 
SISTER stands for Supportive Intensive System of Treatment, Empowerment and 
Recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 After a staggering series of emotional blows that drove home how pitifully 
bleak her life had become -- including being raped at gunpoint by her drug 
dealer -- McCrary-Bond gave up drugs seven years ago. Now she's a SISTER 
counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like God allowed me to go through everything I went through so that I 
can share that story and help somebody else," she said. She plans an album of 
songs inspired by the addiction and recovery experience. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 women have been admitted to SISTER, which claims that 60% remain 
in the program. Considering that its clients are poor, unskilled women who 
often lack support from family and friends, this is a good retention rate, 
Fowler said. Women who drop out are pursued relentlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has made a "marked difference as far as the saving of lives," said 
Michael Woods, manager of a housing development where the program operates. 
</P>
<P>
 On Fridays -- outreach day -- SISTER counselors in bright pink T-shirts and 
jackets blanket drab public housing projects with leaflets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be visible and plant the seeds," she said. The women come to 
realize that "we're not (the housing authority) trying to kick them out, we're 
not . . . trying to take their kids away from them and we're not the police 
trying to arrest them. What we want to do is make ourselves visible so they'll 
know that we are there to help them." 
</P>
<P>
 SISTER clients get together for holiday meals, slumber parties, breakfasts or 
just to watch videos. They also come to depend on each other emotionally.

 Brenda Burleson came to SISTER three years ago when her drug habit got out of 
control. She began stealing, neglecting her children and trading her food 
stamps for drugs. The turning point came when her boyfriend issued an 
ultimatum: She could lose drugs or lose him. 
</P>
<P>
 Burleson turned to the manager of her public housing development for help, and 
he referred her to SISTER. Now she's a counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 The program provides free transportation and baby-sitting services to clients 
so that they can go to counseling sessions and doctor appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 SISTER now is trying to help the women find jobs with training to improve 
interviewing and work skills. Edith Langster, a city councilwoman and a SISTER 
counselor, is talking to area businesses about hiring women who have gone 
through the program.

BIG SALE IS ON AS U.S. MOVES TO TRIM STRATEGIC STOCKPILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pentagon is putting its money where its mouth is on the question of 
whether the Cold War really is over: It is selling off a big chunk of the 
nation's strategic stockpile, which was created to hoard scarce commodities 
that might be needed in a global war. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last few months, the National Defense Stockpile, the Arlington, Va., 
agency that oversees the nation's $6.3-billion strategic inventory, has greatly 
expanded the volume of goods it seeks to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 The original stockpile was set up in the early 1940s after the United States 
found itself short of strategic materials -- metals, minerals, ores and 
industrial jewels -- when the nation entered World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 It was enlarged significantly during the 1950s and has been maintained at high 
levels ever since. The strategic materials actually are stored at some 88 
locations around the country -- at military bases and at warehouses leased from 
commercial firms. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the Cold War now history, the United States believes it will have 
more warning before any conflict begins and therefore does not need to keep 
such a large cache. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, officials say, the Pentagon can count on obtaining many of 
these goods from foreign suppliers -- even if the nation becomes embroiled in 
the kinds of Desert Storm-type regional wars that policy-makers say now are 
likely. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all changed quite drastically since the end of the Cold War," says 
Richard J. Connelly, administrator of the defense stockpile. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most glamorous sale by the agency in recent years was of a 
significant portion of the stockpile's industrial diamonds. The sale, in 
mid-February, unloaded 1.08 million carats, at a price of $68.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Connelly points out, the agency's operations are not all glitter. It 
also is selling such dull-sounding commodities as aluminum, antimony, cadmium, 
fluorspar, iodine, manganese, mica, nickel, quartz, rutile, sebacic acid, 
silicon carbide, talc and tin. 
</P>
<P>
 The materials are used in the manufacture of an array of weapons. Aluminum, 
for example, is used to make aircraft frames and ship parts. Bismuth is used in 
castings and pharmaceuticals, cobalt in jet engines and manganese to make 
batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Agency officials say it isn't just the volume of sales that has changed since 
the Cold War days. Because of the cut in force size, authorities also are 
shifting the types of materials sold, offering more metals, which previously 
would have been needed for weapons, and proportionally less minerals and ores. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem Connelly faces is how to unload the higher volume of strategic 
materials and still meet the two conflicting goals established for his agency 
by Congress -- avoiding undue disruption of world markets and obtaining maximum 
return for taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, such trade groups as the Tannin Extract Producers' Assn. and the 
American Zinc Assn. and countries such as Argentina, Australia, Bolivia and 
Canada occasionally have protested that the planned sales are driving world 
prices down. 
</P>
<P>
 Connelly's solution has been to proceed slowly, keep everything out in the 
open and be prepared to put off any sale if it threatens to prove too 
upsetting. A special interagency Market Impact Committee provides advice. 
</P>
<P>
 One factor making Connelly's job more difficult these days is that, with most 
of the world still in the economic doldrums, the markets are near a low point 
-- making Uncle Sam less likely to reap a big return and industry more likely 
to complain about U.S. sales. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Connelly estimates that it may take 10 to 20 years for the agency 
to work off the excess it now believes it has. This year it plans to sell 
between $350 million and $400 million worth of goods -- up from $139 million a 
year in the Cold War days. 
</P>
<P>
 Connelly's "buy" and "sell" orders come directly from the Pentagon, which 
decides once a year which materials the military is likely to need for the next 
12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency essentially has stopped buying anything, unless it is to upgrade 
the quality of its holdings. If the Cold War were rekindled, Connelly says, it 
would start buying once again. But for now, the big sale is on.

YELTSIN PROPOSES 'CIVIC ACCORD' WITH RIVALS; RUSSIA: THE PACT WOULD BAR 
ATTEMPTS TO FORCE EARLY ELECTIONS OR TRIM THE PRESIDENT'S POWERS. HE UNVEILS IT 
AMID NEW DOUBTS ABOUT HIS HEALTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking political peace for the two years left in his term, Russian President 
Boris N. Yeltsin has unveiled a proposed "civic accord" that would bar any 
attempt to trim his powers or force early elections. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yeltsin raised new doubts about his health by canceling a meeting 
Wednesday at which he was to hand the document to political party 
representatives. One aide said the 63-year-old president was hobbled again, 
apparently by a recurring spine ailment. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he crushed an armed rebellion last October and won enhanced powers in a 
constitutional referendum two months later, Yeltsin's influence and authority 
appear only to have waned. Leaders of the revolt have left prison under an 
amnesty law that Yeltsin tried in vain to block, and they are rallying their 
partisans back to the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Yeltsin has all but dropped out of the struggle. In the past two 
months, he has retreated to his dacha near Moscow, then to a Black Sea 
hideaway, both times fighting what aides called the flu. They often feel 
compelled to deny rumors he is more seriously ill or depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing Yeltsin has made clear is that he has no stomach for more of the 
bare-knuckled political feuds that plagued Russia in 1992 and 1993. His top 
priority now, says presidential spokesman Vyacheslav V. Kostikov, is achieving 
"a political breather, a kind of moratorium on political passions." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's draft civic accord, released late Tuesday by the Itar-Tass news 
agency, proposes just that. It calls on political parties, labor unions and 
social groups to renounce violence and accept the constitution as it is, 
without amendment, until after the 1996 presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
 All signers would refrain from making divisive issues of the October, 1993, 
rebellion and the August, 1991, coup attempt that tried to restore hard-line 
Soviet rule. They would agree not to politic inside the armed forces or make 
"uncivilized" use of the mass media. 
</P>
<P>
 The government would respect other kinds of dissent, allow Russia's 
constituent republics and regions more independence and set up a broad-based 
panel including business, labor and professional representatives to guide 
economic policy. Strikes aimed at securing a bigger share of the federal budget 
would be banned. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview with the newspaper Izvestia, Yeltsin acknowledged that 
the accord, not legally binding, would be hard to enforce. "If we don't achieve 
this result, I will suggest other ways, but I will not give up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to the proposal was so mixed as to cast doubt on whether Yeltsin can 
rally a wide consensus by April 28, the first deadline for signing up. Ivan 
Rybkin, Speaker of the Duma, or lower house of Parliament, endorsed it in 
general terms, as did leaders of some moderate opposition parties. But 
criticism from others was fierce. 
</P>
<P>
 "The president feels that his position is weakening by the day even under the 
new constitution, and he is looking for some new document outside the 
constitution that would help him outsmart his opponents," said Stanislav S. 
Govorukhin, a leader of the middle-of-the-road Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 The Communist Party, bent on wresting powers from Yeltsin through 
constitutional amendment, accused him of trying to stack the rules in his 
favor. Other politicians, even some on Yeltsin's side, dismissed the civic 
accord as a goal too utopian for a society so racked by economic upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like coming up to a patient dying of cancer and handing him a piece of 
paper saying that tomorrow he will be healthy," said Duma Deputy Speaker 
Alexander D. Vengerovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Other politicians believe that prospects for consensus brightened in January 
when the Yeltsin government, mindful of the success of Communists and 
ultranationalists in the December parliamentary elections, shed its most 
radical reformers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the post-election atmosphere, in which both sides were trying to appear 
conciliatory, may be dissolving. A new opposition coalition took shape last 
month as the Communists and their Agrarian Party allies joined forces with 
former Vice President Alexander V. Rutskoi, the main leader of the October 
rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 Freed from prison, Rutskoi is preaching an unrepentant anti-Yeltsin line and 
hinting he will run for president in 1996 -- or sooner if he can force early 
elections. Rutskoi's followers have taken to the streets peacefully but in 
growing numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview published Tuesday in Pravda, Rutskoi dumped on the civic 
accord, saying it is time "to stop playing with consensus or agreements and get 
down to work -- to change the authorities by legal methods." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin had planned to counter by handing the accord to political leaders at 
the Kremlin on Wednesday. But he cut short his workday Tuesday, went to his 
dacha and stayed there Wednesday.

CRASH PROBE CONFIRMS PILOT 'LESSON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Russian pilot was giving a flying lesson to his two children when an 
Aeroflot passenger jet crashed in Siberia last month, killing all 75 aboard, a 
preliminary investigation has found. 
</P>
<P>
 The Transportation Ministry said a cockpit voice recorder showed the pilot was 
demonstrating "the principles of flying" to his son and daughter when the 
Airbus A-310 jet crashed March 22 on a flight from Moscow to Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 The ministry's statement was the first official confirmation of earlier press 
reports of gross violations of flight safety by the Aeroflot crew. 
</P>
<P>
 One version reportedly under investigation is that the pilot's 15-year-old son 
sent the jet into a dive by falling on the controls. 
</P>
<P>
 But investigator Yuri Alexeyev said Wednesday that it is also possible the 
automatic pilot or other equipment failed.

CHINA URGED TO GIVE DETAILS OF HONG KONG REPORTER'S 'SPYING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE COURTNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Key China-appointed advisers from this British colony joined journalists and 
human rights advocates Wednesday in urging the Chinese government to release 
details of the spying conviction of a Hong Kong journalist sentenced to 12 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview, Tsang Yok-sing, a pro-China adviser and chairman of 
Hong Kong's main pro-Beijing party, said he asked China to provide evidence to 
prove that Xi Yang, a Chinese citizen who reports for Hong Kong's mainstream 
Chinese-language daily Ming Pao, did anything other than to simply gather news. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to find out more about the facts of the case first, because many 
people, especially the people working for the media in Hong Kong, have argued 
that Mr. Xi Yang was not engaged in activities other than normal news 
gathering," Tsang said. "Now, if that's the case, then it is very serious 
because it certainly poses a threat to other Hong Kong journalists working both 
in Hong Kong and China in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 China's recent press crackdown has added to the already deep fears held by 
Hong Kong journalists about their freedom and job security after the British 
colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 under a Sino-British agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Xi, 38, was detained in September and charged with espionage for allegedly 
working with an employee of the People's Bank of China to obtain advance 
information about interest rate changes and international gold transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beijing Intermediate Court said Monday that Xi had been found guilty of 
"stealing and spying on state secrets" and imposed a 12-year sentence. Tian Ye, 
an official at the People's Bank of China, was sentenced to 15 years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Top executives of Ming Pao said that a Chinese lawyer who had agreed to act 
for Xi when he appealed his 12-year sentence pulled out of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case has a chilling effect on Hong Kong journalists . . . and because of 
what happened to Xi Yang, journalists, in particular those who cover China 
news, are now self-censoring themselves," said Daisy Li, chairwoman of the Hong 
Kong Journalists Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, police in China confirmed that they have detained a woman who 
worked for dissident Wei Jingsheng, news agencies reported from Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Tong Yi, who maintained close relations with the foreign press in Beijing, had 
been missing since Tuesday. Wei is back in custody for what authorities call 
"new crimes."

TALKS STALL AS ISRAELIS LEAVE FOR HOLOCAUST OBSERVANCE; MIDEAST: CHANCES DIM 
FOR ACCORD WITH PLO BEFORE NEXT WEEK'S TARGET DATE FOR PULLOUT OF TROOPS. 
</P>

<P>
 A potential new crisis in Palestinian peace negotiations loomed Wednesday as 
the Israeli delegation left Egypt without reaching an accord on deployment of 
Palestinian police, and negotiators said they were less hopeful that a final 
agreement can be reached by April 13. 
</P>
<P>
 An obviously shaken Nabil Shaath, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said he 
tried to persuade the Israelis to stay and continue the talks but that they 
refused and left on a scheduled trip home to observe the annual Holocaust day 
of remembrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to leave came almost immediately after Shaath brought the 
Israelis a report from Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser 
Arafat, who arrived in Cairo on Wednesday to consult on the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The abrupt departure was an apparent indication that no agreement was 
immediately at hand on dispatching an early contingent of Palestinian police to 
the Gaza Strip, a move originally foreseen for this week. It raised questions 
about whether Israeli and Palestinian negotiators can reach agreement on 
autonomy in Gaza and in Jericho in the West Bank before next week's target date 
for Israeli withdrawal from the two regions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Gaza Strip, a ceremony scheduled to hand over the keys of the first 
Israeli police station was abruptly canceled when the Palestinians, on apparent 
instructions from the PLO, said they would not attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We received orders today not to take over the station. . . . The transfer 
will be postponed perhaps for a few days because of the snags in Cairo," Rashid 
abu Shbak, a Palestinian deportee who returned from exile this week to act as a 
liaison with the Israelis, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli delegation had been scheduled to leave Wednesday to commemorate 
Holocaust Day in Israel today, with talks scheduled to resume Sunday. But their 
early departure, in the afternoon, along with their refusal to consider 
Shaath's requests to continue, indicated slow going in the talks, particularly 
on the issue of early deployment of Palestinian police. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath said the major stumbling block was the Israelis' failure to commit to a 
date for signing a final agreement and beginning the Israeli withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath said the Israelis left without wrapping up negotiations to meet the 
April 13 target. "It's a matter that causes great difficulties, and we will not 
take responsibility for it. The Israelis will take full responsibility for it," 
he declared. 
</P>
<P>
 A disappointed Shaath said negotiations could have continued, despite the 
Israeli holiday, and would have been more likely to produce results. The 
Israelis have pledged to continue the exchanges by telephone and fax over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do very much appreciate the need for mourning and remembrance of the 
Holocaust; it is something that we share the indignation for," Shaath said. 
"But we have done this before many times. Every time, the day of the intifada 
(the Palestinian uprising), or the day of Sabra and Chatilla (commemorating the 
massacre of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon in 1982), or other days, we used to 
abstain for an hour of mourning and remembrance, we used to pray for those who 
have died, but then we used to continue." 
</P>
<P>
 Through almost four days of negotiations this week -- after the signing last 
week of an agreement to send an international observer force to Hebron to 
protect Palestinians there -- the two sides sought to agree on deployment of 
Palestinian police in Gaza and Jericho, the two regions that are to have 
interim Palestinian self-rule under an overall accord signed by Israel and the 
PLO last September. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there were initial plans to send a vanguard of about 300 Palestinian 
police to Gaza as early as this week, and up to 1,500 police a week later, the 
talks bogged down in disputes -- over how many police would be allowed in the 
early stages, how much authority they would have, how they would be armed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israelis resisted anything more than about 1,000 Palestinian officers 
before a full agreement is signed, under which perhaps 9,000 Palestinian police 
will be deployed in the two regions. Palestinian police commanders insisted on 
commitments on a date for Israeli withdrawal and not just a timetable for how 
long the pullout would take. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not serious about reaching an agreement on specific dates such as 
April 13," complained Gen. Nasr Youssef, who will command the Palestinian 
force. "They have suggested a timetable for withdrawal within three weeks, but 
they have not specified a date for the start of the operation. . . . They are 
procrastinating and drawing things out." 
</P>
<P>
 The timing is critical for Palestinian commanders, who do not want to enter 
the territories while there is still a large Israeli military presence. 
Palestinians hope to arrive with a show of authority that will assure the 
population that they are in control.

850 MORE TROOPS SENT TO CURB VIOLENCE IN ZULU AREAS; SOUTH AFRICA: STATE OF 
EMERGENCY HAS FAILED TO END FIGHTING. ADDITIONAL FORCES WILL BE DEPLOYED BEFORE 
APRIL 26-28 VOTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After one of the bloodiest weeks in this country's recent history, the 
military deployed up to 850 more combat troops Wednesday to violence-scarred 
Zulu townships of Natal province to enforce a state of emergency, which has so 
far failed to curb bitter factional fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 The reinforcements, drawn from infantry and light artillery reserve units in 
Natal, bring the total force here to about 2,000 troops. More troops will be 
deployed April 15 for about a month to cover the volatile province during the 
April 26-28 elections and their aftermath, the military said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation is very tense," spokeswoman Capt. Kim Van Niekerk said in a 
telephone interview. At least 100 people have been reported killed in township 
wars since President Frederik W. de Klerk announced emergency rule last 
Thursday in the tribal Zulu homeland of KwaZulu and surrounding Natal province. 
</P>
<P>
 The strife -- which usually takes the form of drive-by shootings, arson and 
massacres of civilians -- is part of the intensifying conflict between Zulu 
followers of Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party and Nelson 
Mandela's African National Congress. The majority of victims this week have 
been in ANC strongholds. 
</P>
<P>
 The death toll has grown dramatically since Buthelezi pledged to boycott the 
election that his archrival, Mandela, is expected to win. ANC officials in 
Natal complain that the emergency decree has failed to protect their supporters 
and to ensure a free election. 
</P>
<P>
 In a dramatic display of the problems the security forces face, dozens of 
police and soldiers looked on as an estimated 10,000 anti-election Zulus defied 
emergency regulations and marched Tuesday with their "traditional" weapons in 
Empangeni in northern Natal. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they had decided not to strip the Inkatha protesters of spears, 
fighting clubs, machetes and knives to avoid a confrontation. The march was 
peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the neutral Independent Electoral Commission reported Tuesday 
that peaceful and free elections are not possible in KwaZulu and Natal "in the 
current political climate." 
</P>
<P>
 It cited a "high level" of political intolerance and fear, intimidation, a 
failure of KwaZulu authorities to assist election officials and the inability 
of South African police to protect the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopes that the fighting can be curbed to permit free balloting are now riding 
on a "peace summit" scheduled Friday morning among key players in the crisis -- 
Mandela, Buthelezi, De Klerk and the Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelithini. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a speech Wednesday at the University of Durban, Mandela flatly refused 
Buthelezi's demand that the elections be delayed. "There will be no 
postponement of elections in this province or any part of this province," 
Mandela told cheering students. "We will not postpone our freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela also made a veiled threat that the new black-led government will cut 
off funding from Pretoria that supports Buthelezi's one-party regime in 
KwaZulu, one of 10 "homelands" created under apartheid in the unsuccessful 
attempt to permanently separate the races. Leaders "not very far from here," he 
said, "are not going to get those funds that they have abused and used to kill 
innocent people." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Johann Kriegler, head of the electoral commission, also gave no sign of 
bending to Buthelezi's demand. "The elections will go on," he told a news 
conference. "The few spoilers are not going to frustrate the vast majority of 
those who want to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Roelf Meyer, the government's constitutional development minister, said a 
delay is not "a viable option." He told a Johannesburg radio station that "we 
would run into constitutional problems . . . we would run into political 
problems, as far as the tensions that would flow from such a decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi, a longtime ANC opponent, has insisted that the interim constitution 
does not provide enough devolution of powers to provinces. He also insists that 
King Zwelithini, a largely powerless monarch who has often appeared in 
Buthelezi's shadow, be guaranteed sovereign powers.

 Here are reactions from some of Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun's 
colleagues to his announcement that he will retire: 
</P>
<P>
 * Justice David H. Souter: "I dissent." 
</P>
<P>
 * Justice Sandra Day O'Connor: "With Justice Blackmun's retirement, following 
so soon that of Justice (Byron R.) White, we will have lost much of the 
institutional memory of the court. His presence here for 24 years has been 
marked by compassion for individual litigants and by careful attention to 
detail. We will miss him." 
</P>
<P>
 * Justice John Paul Stevens: "Justice Blackmun is the quintessential gentleman 
and scholar. His judicial work combines meticulous accuracy and sensitive 
awareness of the impact of our decisions on the real world. Far more than most 
of us, he has labored to make the law the servant of justice and decency. I am 
honored by his friendship and shall miss his wise counsel." 
</P>
<P>
 * Justice Clarence Thomas: "It was an honor to have worked with Justice 
Blackmun, and I am saddened to see him retire; he will be deeply missed. He is 
a friend and colleague, and it has been a pleasure to work with him." 
</P>
<P>
 * Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist: "Justice Blackmun has made significant 
contributions to the court's jurisprudence . . . . On a personal note, he was 
the only member of the court whom I knew when I came 22 years ago and I shall 
miss him." 
</P>
<P>
 * Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in a note to Blackmun: "You have shown us all 
that it is possible constantly to grow in wisdom and in humanity. And when you 
ask questions, they are the best. A sample from 20 years ago is enclosed. You 
helped me to end on a high note that day." She enclosed part of the transcript 
of a 1974 case that she argued as an attorney before the high court. 
</P>
<P>
 * Retired Justice William J. Brennan: "Justice Harry Blackmun has served with 
enormous distinction during 24 terms on the court and throughout his career. 
The combination of abiding humility, deep compassion, formidable legal insight 
and a tireless work ethic have made Justice Blackmun a magnificent jurist, an 
admirable human being and a wonderful friend." 
</P>
<P>
 * Retired Justice Byron R. White: "Justice Blackmun has left many important 
and meaningful tracts on the federal law throughout his 34 years as a jurist. 
He was a very satisfactory colleague and has had a great career."

81 ARRESTED IN CHINESE SMUGGLING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal agents have arrested 81 people in an investigation of a gang accused 
of smuggling Chinese people into this country and holding them for ransom. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents said 63 people were taken into custody after a federal raid on a small 
three-bedroom home in Mitchellville, Md.Six others were seized at a Washington 
restaurant, and the FBI said 12 were detained in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 John O'Malley of the Baltimore office of the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service said that, because of language problems, it still was not clear who was 
a captive immigrant and who was a captor. He said the Mitchellville group, 
which included seven women and five children, appeared to be in good physical 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said it appears that the Chinese were brought ashore in Virginia in 
March and the Maryland home was a holding point for moving captives to New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fuk Ching gang is known for smuggling Chinese into the country and forcing 
them to work in slave conditions in New York or Los Angeles Chinatown 
sweatshops until relatives pay $30,000 or more for their release.

ARISTIDE ENDS U.S.-HAITI PACT ON REFUGEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in a letter to President 
Clinton, said he is ending a treaty that allows the United States to stop 
fleeing Haitian refugees at sea and return them to their homeland, an Aristide 
aide said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials said the letter was received Monday at the 
White House and was under review. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide legal adviser Michael Barnes said Aristide's letter gave a required 
six-month notice to terminate the treaty, which has been used as the legal 
basis for U.S. Coast Guard interception of thousands of Haitian boat people. 
</P>
<P>
 A State Department spokesman said the United States would continue to operate 
under the terms of the 1981 agreement because of the provision for six months' 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, a U.S. official in Haiti had said the military resumed its policy 
of arresting some of the boat people forcibly returned to the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights groups have also reported an increase in the numbers of arrests 
and killings of Aristide supporters in Haiti in recent weeks as the military 
fights any move to return Aristide to power. The military ousted him in 
September, 1991, and failed to honor an agreement to restore him to power. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1981 agreement originally called for the refugees to receive repatriation 
hearings at sea to determine whether they were fleeing the country for 
political or economic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 But in May, 1992, then-President George Bush changed the policy so that all 
boat people were returned to Haiti and only after they were back could they 
apply for political asylum in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes said Aristide cited the Bush changes as a sign that the United States 
had already abrogated the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes, a former U.S. congressman, said Aristide was urging Haitians not to 
take to the open seas in boats to flee to the United States because of the 
dangers involved in the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 He said "serious, constructive" discussions were going on between the Clinton 
Administration and the Aristide government at the highest levels to resolve 
problems between the two sides.

CLINTON SENDS RECORDS TO FORMER WHITEWATER PARTNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton has sent copies of Whitewater Development Corp. records to 
his former business partner, James B. McDougal, who had complained publicly 
earlier this year that he was unable to prepare his tax returns without the 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
 David E. Kendall, Clinton's lawyer, said in a letter to McDougal's attorney 
that he had sent the records -- about 2,000 pages of land sale contracts, 
escrow receipts and Whitewater bank account statements -- to McDougal on 
Monday. Kendall's letter was released by the White House on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal's attorney, Sam Heuer of Little Rock, Ark., said Wednesday that he 
had received the records but that they remained sealed in his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim (McDougal) hasn't been through them yet," Heuer said. "When he can come 
in, we'll catalogue them and see what they consist of." 
</P>
<P>
 Heuer said that although he is not required to keep the records secret, he 
will not allow anyone besides McDougal to look at them until he knows precisely 
what the files contain. 
</P>
<P>
 The records, which the White House has declined to release to the public, 
include the collection of Whitewater-related papers that were in the office of 
Vincent Foster, the White House deputy counsel who apparently committed suicide 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The material also includes documents that Kendall has collected from other 
sources in recent months, the letter stated. 
</P>
<P>
 According to McDougal, whose account is not disputed by the White House, 
Foster obtained the Whitewater-related papers from McDougal before Clinton took 
office. At the Clintons' behest, Foster had offered to prepare several years of 
corporate tax returns for the Whitewater firm, which was formed by the Clintons 
and McDougal and his wife to build a resort community in the Ozarks. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal apparently neglected to prepare and file the returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster had completed his tax work and sent the necessary information to 
accountants before he died but had not returned the documents to McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
 The revelation that the papers were in Foster's office at the time of his 
death was key in thrusting the Whitewater controversy back into the nation's 
headlines and triggering the appointment of special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. 
to investigate the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you are aware, all documents relating to Whitewater from Mr. McDougal and 
other sources which I have collected have been turned over to the special 
counsel without any claim of privilege of any kind," Kendall noted in his 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Kendall went on to note that neither he nor the Clintons "have been able to 
locate anything approaching a complete set of records for Whitewater. For 
example, I have been unable to find stock books, corporate minute books and 
several other kinds of typical corporate records." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske is looking into allegations that President Clinton may have benefited 
improperly from his association with McDougal, owner of the failed Madison 
Guaranty Savings & Loan as well as a partner in the Whitewater development. 
Although the special counsel's inquiry centers on Whitewater, Fiske is also 
investigating Foster's death last July. His inquiry also encompasses the role 
played by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and her Little Rock law firm in 
representing Whitewater and Madison Guaranty.

CHICAGO POLICE SEEK WARRANTLESS SWEEPS TO SEIZE GUNS; CRIME: YEARS OF RAIDS AT 
TENEMENT COMPLEX FAILED TO BREAK GRIP OF GANG VIOLENCE. COURT TEST ON HEATED 
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE IS EXPECTED TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN BRAUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like soldiers in an army of occupation, squads of police officers fan out each 
night through the Robert Taylor Homes, a tombstone row of high-rise tenement 
buildings that loom for 18 city blocks over the Dan Ryan Expressway in south 
Chicago. Ignoring taunts from gang members, they poke through bullet-pocked 
elevator shafts, boiler rooms and laundry commons, searching for automatic 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Today Chicago Housing Authority director Vincent Lane is hoping a court will 
allow police to do much more -- storm through the doors of individual 
apartments without warrants, and give them free reign to seize guns, drugs and 
contraband without first obtaining a judge's consent. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Wayne R. Anderson will rule on a request by the American 
Civil Liberties Union for a preliminary injunction against the raids. Although 
Anderson issued a restraining order last month against warrantless raids, he 
indicated last week that in emergency situations he might allow some 
inspections without warrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane's resolve has been bolstered by support from Chicago Mayor Richard M. 
Daley, who testified before Anderson last week that tenants at the 4,400 Taylor 
apartments "want the guns out of these buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 Six years of repeated police sweeps in the Taylor homes have failed to break 
the grip of gang violence. For the last week, Chicago police have been on 
"vertical patrol," a building-by-building sweep of the Taylor homes prompted by 
a flare-up of gunfire that prompted 324 shooting incidents in four days. It was 
a grim record for a place that is a human shooting range, a 28-building complex 
where automatic weapons fire is so common that fusillades routinely greet the 
coming of warm weather every spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The promise of drastic measures against crime in return for the suspension of 
constitutional rights is an alluring trade-off for many Americans at a time 
when fear of violence has reached a fever pitch. But the push for warrantless 
raids by Lane has divided Taylor's 12,300 residents and embroiled civil 
liberties groups, anti-crime activists and even the Clinton Administration in 
the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Lane said that federal Housing and Urban Development officials 
have told him they support the concept of warrantless raids and other toughened 
security measures to protect public housing residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane said he expected federal officials to "intervene on our behalf" in the 
lawsuit, backing not only the raids, but the installation of metal detectors in 
building lobbies and mandatory identity cards for project residents. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD spokeswoman Vivian Potter confirmed only that agency officials are 
examining several options. But several high-ranking Housing, Justice and White 
House officials said Wednesday that despite their empathy for Lane's tactics 
and the plight of Taylor tenants, there are no plans for court intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane first ordered police into apartments without permission last summer, 
after gang members chased off housing workers installing child-proof screens on 
windows inside one Taylor building. The ACLU sought the restraining order 
halting the raids. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethel Washington, one of Taylor's two tenant group presidents, says only her 
"loud mouth" halted a raid on her apartment. "We're all afraid of guns down 
here, but we're fools if we start giving up our rights to get rid of them," 
Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the ACLU and the American Alliance for Rights and Responsibilities, a 
public interest group which filed a motion in support of the raids, are 
representing Taylor residents, each claiming they have a majority of tenants on 
their side. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 5,000 housing project residents have petitioned the court stating 
their willingness to give up the right of search and seizure to free their 
buildings of guns. Among them is Artensa Randolph, who heads all of the city's 
public housing tenant councils. Randolph, who lives in a low-rise project 
across the street from the Taylor homes, still mourns a grandson killed two 
years ago during a gang shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is these ACLU lawyers are forcing us and our children to limit our 
lives," Randolph said. "We're tired of having to run for cover and grab our 
kids every time we hear gunshots. What kind of life is that?" 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, the so-called vertical patrols are working. The staccato of 
semiautomatics has given way to silence. Only a few brave children have 
returned to the project's battered playgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grand-mama said I could come for 15 minutes," said Taneesha Wright, 9, 
stuffed into a puffy Windbreaker. "And it's almost up," said her grandmother, 
who stood sternly watching nearby. "You got two more minutes on the swing." 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago Police Commander Robert Guthrie, who heads a force of 100 officers 
assigned to patrol all of the city's public housing units, said 31 guns, mostly 
automatic weapons, have been recovered from elevator shafts, trash chutes and 
other public areas. The sweeps have netted 24 arrests on an assortment of 
weapons charges, criminal trespassing and rock cocaine and marijuana 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
 "We go in each building for six or seven hours, secure it and talk to the 
residents to reassure them," Guthrie said. "For the moment, it calms things 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 The sweeps are only a temporary abatement, police acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Even augmented by 400 housing authority police, there are not enough officers 
to remain on permanent patrol in the Taylor homes -- not when violence can 
erupt anytime at the notorious Cabrini-Green projects downtown, as it did 14 
months ago, or in any of the city's other high-rise projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like squeezing a balloon," Guthrie said. "We push down hard one place 
and crime pops up someplace else." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not just the endless volleys of gunfire that proved the potency of 
competing Black Disciple and Gangster Disciple gangs in the Taylor homes last 
week. It was also the ease with which gang members cut the lights in several 
northern buildings and the brazenness with which they evicted one Taylor 
building manager at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 And there has been a deadly spillover effect beyond the Taylor homes' borders, 
out into neighboring communities like Englewood, where two youths were shot to 
death in separate incidents linked to the housing project unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have floated several theories for the violence. Lane says it 
stems from a South Side bar spat. Chicago Police Supt. Matt Rodriguez blames 
the gunfire on a dispute over the "turf tax" paid to gang members by outside 
drug dealers. Guthrie would only say police have detected "fluidity" in 
relations between the Black Disciple and Gangster Disciple gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 The cat-and-mouse game between police and gang members proceeds with wearying 
regularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Many tenants scoff at the police sweeps. "They're as regular as elevator 
breakdowns," snorted Taylor resident Roosevelt Harris the morning after housing 
security officers stormed through the 16-story residence where he lives at 53rd 
and State streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing police are mocked as "Robos" for their uniformed impotence, Harris 
said. City police officers are more respected. "They mean business," Harris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But most residents know that as soon as the vertical patrols are gone, the 
drug dealers will be back. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's life in Taylor, baby," Harris said. 
</P>

CASH-CRAZED CROWD TRASHES LIBRARY SHELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ft. Worth Central Library was in shambles Wednesday after more than 500 
people responded to a radio station's publicity stunt by rushing through the 
aisles, climbing shelves and throwing books to the floor in search of money. 
</P>
<P>
 A disc jockey had announced Tuesday evening that Dallas-based country radio 
station KYNG-FM used $5 and $10 bills as bookmarks in the fiction section. 
</P>
<P>
 The library staff and a host of volunteers were busy Wednesday sorting through 
more than 3,000 books that frenzied listeners tossed on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "People started climbing the bookshelves; they started climbing on each other, 
and books became airborne," library spokeswoman Marsha Anderson said. Some of 
the books ended up with ripped pages and broken spines. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear how much money was actually put in the books. The station claims 
it was only about $100, but the library staff did not know anything about it. 
</P>
<P>
 They were caught by surprise when hundreds of people began pouring through the 
doors, saying they had heard $10,000 was hidden in the books. 
</P>
<P>
 A KYNG spokesman said the disc jockey only wanted to boost public interest in 
the library by giving away about $100, and had no idea why listeners assumed 
that as much as $10,000 was at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 After several unsuccessful attempts to reach the radio station, library 
workers tried to restore calm by falsely announcing that the money had been 
found and the contest was over.

 A publicist who admitted having a "sexual relationship" with Marla Trump's

her shoes and lingerie. 
</P>

 Chuck Jones, 52, a former public relations aide for Mrs. Trump, rejected 
several plea deals that would have spared him jail but would have required 
psychiatric counseling. A jury had convicted Jones Feb. 16 of burglary,

4 CONVICTED IN OFFICER'S 1988 SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A jury convicted four gang members Wednesday in the 1988 murder of San Diego 
Police Officer Jerry Hartless, a crime that shocked city residents and brought 
warnings from officials of an increased tendency among gangs to use violence to 
protect drug turf. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1991 trial with only one defendant ended with jurors deadlocked 6 to 
6.Rather than drop the case or offer the defendants a chance to plead guilty to 
a lesser crime, prosecutors indicted five additional members of the Syndo Mob 
gang for the retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this conviction says is that when a police officer is killed, we will 
never give up until justice is done," Dist. Atty. Edwin L. Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacy Butler, 30, the defendant in the deadlocked first trial, was convicted 
of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder, along with Kevin 
Standard, 30, and Clifton Cunningham, 31. Edric Jordon, 29, was found innocent 
of the same counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Bradshaw, 31, was found guilty of conspiracy, but the jury deadlocked 
11 to 1 in favor finding him guilty of murder. The jury also deadlocked 11 to 1 
in favor of conviction on both charges against Kyle Winters, 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Those convicted of murder face possible life in prison without parole.

 A magnitude 4.8 earthquake centered between Lake Arrowhead and Big Bear shook 
much of Southern California on Wednesday, causing a few cracks in buildings 
near the epicenter and sending rocks onto highways in some places. 
</P>
<P>
 No injuries were reported in the 12:01 p.m. temblor, which scientists at 
Caltech and the U.S. Geological Survey said was outside the aftershock zone of 
the 1992 Landers and Big Bear earthquakes and therefore was a separate seismic 
event. Although it was unrelated to the Jan. 17 Northridge quake, a modest 
3.5-magnitude aftershock of the Northridge temblor did occur about nine hours 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's 4.8 jolt occurred within five miles of the San Andreas Fault, near 
Running Springs on California 18. Seismologist Lucile M. Jones of the 
Geological Survey said it was "close enough to be a foreshock" of a large quake 
on California's most significant fault, but the probability of such a quake 
occurring in the next day or so is only 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 At the California Highway Patrol station at Running Springs, Sgt. Casey Bos 
said the earthquake "felt like it was directly beneath me. We got a pretty good 
jolt." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the CHP office sustained some cosmetic cracks in the wall but no 
structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocks ranging in size "from baseballs to basketballs" fell onto California 18, 
the Rim of the World Highway, Bos said. No traffic problems or damage was 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Running Springs resident John Karevoll said he was leaning over a kitchen 
counter, munching on a cheese sandwich, when the earthquake struck and "knocked 
the food right out of my mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the shaker was remarkable for its sharpness -- and brevity. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said the depth of the horizontal, strike-slip earthquake was only three 
miles, accounting for some of its sharpness. It was felt lightly in Los 
Angeles, Orange and northern San Diego counties and more heavily in the Inland 
Empire.

O.C. POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: PAT DONOHUE: A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine a dystopian near-future in which such huge rents have been torn in the 
American social fabric that even the Twin Cities are threatening to rip 
asunder. 
</P>
<P>
 Minneapolis and St. Paul would sit there, side by side at the brink, preparing 
to lob mortar shells back and forth across the Mississippi River at each other, 
just like Belfast, Bosnia and Beirut, only colder. 
</P>
<P>
 With bloodshed imminent, the sanest heads on both sides would enter tense, 
11th-hour negotiations and arrive at the only possible way out: We'll settle 
this thing with a guitar-picking contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Minneapolis would look to its western suburb of Wayzata and, amid much 
gloating, bring forth a champion: Leo Kottke, the good-natured Goliath of the 
steel-string acoustic, a monstrous player, famous and dominant in his field 
since the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 To preserve its liberty, property and honor, St. Paul, the underdog, would 
call upon a native son. Pat Donohue. 
</P>
<P>
 The rank-and-file Minneapolitans would laugh at this little-known upstart, 
just like the Philistines of old. "Who's he?" they'd cackle. "What -- those 
losers are putting up a talk-show host against Leo the lionhearted? We'll have 
'em municipally cleansed by sundown." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But if you looked at Leo, you might see him shaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's abandon our grim little fantasy and point to a more pleasant 
here-and-now, in which the vaunted Kottke respects the heck out of his fellow 
Minnesotan, and maybe even fears him just a little. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's the implication of the typically dry-humored assessment Kottke 
wrote for the CD booklet of Donohue's current album, "Two Hand Band": 
</P>
<P>
 About Pat Donohue . . . I first heard him on the radio and got upset. Then I 
heard him in concert somewhere and got more upset. He thinks harmonically, 
improvises beautifully and writes. Disgusting. Enjoy this record, but if you're 
a guitar player, it's going to haunt you.  
</P>
<P>
 Listen to the album, and it becomes clear that Kottke has not overestimated 
Donohue's ability. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-instrumental collection, which could be described as jazz-influenced 
folk, or folk-ified jazz, features Donohue's arrangements of songs by Duke 
Ellington, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis and others. 
</P>
<P>
 The album's subtitle, "Jazz Classics & Selected Tunes for Solo Fingerpicked 
Guitar," is telling. If Donohue (who plays Friday at Shade Tree Stringed 
Instruments) did not guarantee that this was a solo guitar record, you'd swear 
that he was using overdubs, or an uncredited ghost accompanist. 
</P>
<P>
 His playing is rich with active, nimble bass lines that would in themselves 
seem to give a guitarist plenty to do. Laid against them are complex chord work 
and elaborate, deftly executed single-note runs. It's about as much harmonious 
sound as can be produced by two hands, wood and strings. 
</P>
<P>
 As a capper, on a concluding version of the Booker T. & the MG's classic 
"Green Onions," the 40-year-old picker somehow gets his guitar to emulate the 
throbbing, whirring sounds that Booker T. Jones produced with his Hammond B3 
organ on the original hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Kottke, Donohue can step out of his instrumental-whiz guise and turn into 
a more-than-competent singer-songwriter. His 1991 album, "Life Stories," 
featured his pleasant singing and catchy, literate songwriting, along with 
guitar work that, though toned down to work within a vocal framework, was 
dazzling nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 So why is Donohue without a recording deal ("Life Stories" and "Two Hand Band" 
both appear on his custom label, Blue Sky Records) and still but a speck in the 
expanding market for acoustic music? 
</P>
<P>
 Donohue thinks that, in terms of getting radio exposure, he may be paying for 
his own eclecticism. The influences he cites include such long-dead 
country-blues musicians as Blind Blake and Robert Johnson, seminal jazz guitar 
figures Charlie Christian and Wes Montgomery, a whole roster of jazz pianists, 
including Fats Waller and Jelly Roll Morton, and, on the country side, Chet 
Atkins. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult, because people don't know how to pigeonhole what I do," the 
easygoing Donohue said, sitting in the basement of his St. Paul home, and not 
minding too much that his 6-year-old daughter, Daisy, and a playmate were 
crashing around on the same drum set that had been Donohue's first instrument 
when he was a kid. 
</P>
<P>
 Donohue also issued two late-'80s releases on Red House Records, a tiny St. 
Paul folk label. "The styles on the two Red House records are very diverse, and 
I think it caused a lot of confusion" among acoustic-format disc jockeys. " 
'Two Hand Band" is my most focused, but it's just a quarter or a third of what 
I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Donohue says that even with its unified concept of applying folk-based 
finger-picking to the jazz heritage, the album has had a hard time fitting into 
today's severely segmented radio formats (a problem that the similarly eclectic 
Kottke didn't have to face when he emerged more than 20 years ago). 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes (radio programmers) think it's too jazzy to be folk, and of course 
the jazz people think it's too folkie. But I don't feel like making a contrived 
record to reach a certain corner of the buying public." 
</P>
<P>
 Donohue isn't entirely without high-profile radio exposure. Another fellow 
Minnesotan, Garrison Keillor, has been a fan since the mid-'80s and lately has 
featured Donohue regularly on "Prairie Home Companion." 
</P>
<P>
 Donohue is considering a more bluesy direction for his next record, but he 
isn't sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to get on a schedule of doing about one (album) a year. But I don't 
have a whole album's worth of one particular style, and I'm not anxious to send 
out another mishmash album of a lot of different styles. I have to come to 
terms with my identity, narrow down what I record, just to find a niche. My 
problem is I like them all too much." 
</P>
<P>
 In concert, Donohue says, his diversity turns from a liability into an asset. 
</P>
<P>
 "Live, it's never a problem. It works really well, because people get off on 
the variety. I have one rule on stage these days: play whatever in the world I 
most feel like playing at that moment. At least I have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Beatles and other '60s rockers first inspired Donohue, who at the age of 
10 cajoled a drum kit out of his dad. At 12, he stayed home sick from school 
one day and began amusing himself with his older sister's guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 Donohue kept on playing guitar, but he remained focused on drums as he began 
to play in high-school rock bands. A band mate got him interested in the blues 
of Muddy Waters and Robert Johnson, and by 17 Donohue had become obsessed with 
the guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very lucky to see some of the old-timers that aren't around anymore," 
he said. "The University of Minnesota had summer concerts in the early '70s, 
and I got to see Lightnin' Hopkins, Big Joe Williams, Jesse Fuller."  
</P>
<P>
 "I was not shy about going up to them and trying to befriend them and find out 
what I could about blues and playing. By and large, they were very 
accommodating. Big Joe Williams invited me to his hotel room, and we wound up 
playing guitar together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With his tastes expanding to jazz, country and ragtime, Donohue spent his 20s 
obsessed with the guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd play all the time. I still go through periods of that. But now that I'm 
married and have a family, it's not convenient. I play every day, as much as 
possible. Sometimes it's four or six hours, sometimes it's 15 minutes. I bend 
it around how the rest of my life works out." 
</P>
<P>
 During that decade of guitar obsession, Donohue says, "I was good at copping 
things (from guitarists he admired), but I had nothing that was Pat Donohue.  
</P>
<P>
 "In my early 30s, that all came together," he said. "I don't know if I could 
pinpoint it, because it was such a gradual thing. In my 20s, I was playing good 
music, but still in a learning mode. When I started writing in my late 20s and 
30s, I realized I could have a musical voice of my own." 
</P>
<P>
 Donohue has built enough of an audience to be on the road about a third of the 
year, in short stretches that minimize disruption to family life. He estimates 
his average concert draw at 100. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not an impressive figure, but at this level it's enough to keep 
going," said the guitarist, whose wife, Susan, is a free-lance writer. "I don't 
have aspirations of superstardom. I would like to get notoriety to the point 
where I could go into any house and have a full house, be it 50 seats or 200 or 
500." 
</P>
<P>
 While building his performing career, Donohue divided his time between music 
and working in the family business, a brick distributorship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to do both, but last year I managed to extract myself from (the 
business)," he said. "Until recently, I never let myself think I was going to 
be able to (remain) a musician. I thought, 'This will end and I'll have to get 
a job.' But here I am, 40, and I'm still doing it, so I've resigned myself -- 
and it feels good."' 
</P>
<P>
 From Kottke's humorously skewed point of view, that could be a threatening 
prospect. If inter-city disputes were settled with guitars, St. Paul would be 
armed and nuclear. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pat Donohue plays Friday at 7:30 p.m. at Shade Tree Stringed Instruments, 
28062-D Forbes Road, Laguna Niguel. $14. (714) 364-5270.

D.L. MENARD TOPS CAJUN FEST LINEUP; THE ARTIST AND HIS LOUISIANA ACES WILL BE 
ONE OF SIX ACTS TO PERFORM AT THE LONG BEACH EVENT, WHICH IS RETURNING DESPITE 
A FINANCIAL LOSS IN 1993. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 D.L. Menard, "the Cajun Hank Williams," will headline the 1994 Southern 
California Cajun & Zydeco Festival June 4 and 5 at the Rainbow Lagoon, next to 
the Long Beach Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer-guitarist-songwriter Menard and his band, the Louisiana Aces, top a 
six-act lineup that includes Walter Mouton & the Scott Playboys who, according 
to the festival promoter, have played only one Saturday night concert outside 
their home town of Scott, La., since the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 Also from Louisiana, accordionist Steve Riley & the Mamou Playboys and Nathan 
& the Zydeco Cha-Chas will be making return appearances. The Poullard Brothers, 
from Texas, and Joe Simien, a Los Angeles transplant, round out the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoter Franklin Zawacki said he is going ahead with the eighth annual 
festival even though he lost about $40,000 last year because of heavy rain and 
competition from a Troubadours of Folk festival held at UCLA that same weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We set a record," Zawacki said by phone Wednesday from his office in San 
Francisco. "In 100 years of recorded history, in the whole month of June, the 
most rainfall Long Beach (ever) had was one-twentieth of an inch. We got 1 1/2 
inches that first day." 
</P>
<P>
 While the odds are against a repeat of last year's unseasonable downpour, the 
Cajun & Zydeco festival will coincide again with the other festival, which has 
been renamed Troubadours of Music and Crafts Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Troubadour fest promoter Jim Rissmiller said Wednesday that he decided against 
changing the dates of his festival because he wants to establish it in fans' 
minds. He also said, "I don't know if in a city this size you could do any 
event on a weekend and not have some competition." 
</P>
<P>
 "My own feeling," Zawacki responded, is that "with the name change, we won't 
have that same tug of war with our audience." He also noted that Rissmiller's 
co-promoter last year, Rhino Records, brought in certain bands that previously 
had performed at Zawacki's festivals, creating "an unfortunate pull for 
patrons." Rhino is no longer involved with Rissmiller. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Zawacki is especially excited about this year's appearance at his festival by 
Mouton. "It took me six years of visiting Mouton in Scott to persuade him" to 
play out of town on a Saturday night, Zawacki said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept trying to coax him to come to Rhode Island" for the Cajun & Zydeco 
festival that Zawacki presents there, in the village of Escoheag. "He did that 
this year, and now he's agreed to come to California." Mouton's band typifies 
the "prairie-sound" wing of Cajun music, which incorporates such elements of 
country music as steel guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the music, the festival will feature food booths plus dance, 
music and cultural workshops from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. each day. Ticket prices 
have not been announced. Information is available from Comprehensive Child 
Development in Long Beach, which helps organize events and receives some 
proceeds from the festival: (310) 427-3713.

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: SPRING HAS SPRUNG; SO HAVE THE WILDFLOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spring seemed to beat down the door this year. So anxious was it to get here 
that during the March rains, the sticky, sweet smell of blossoms, from the 
orange and lemon trees in my garden, oozed through the windows, making the 
bedroom smell like a department store perfume counter during a half-price sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Nature, when left to her own devices, seems to do her best work; right now, 
she has smattered colorful wildflowers all over the county, providing a field 
day for mountain hikers, trail walkers and even highway drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 The flowers are especially fine in the fire-scarred areas, where the blaze has 
burned vegetation that normally intrudes on wildflower growth. A glimpse of the 
rare chocolate lily might even reward those willing to pull on some boots and 
hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Free-lance writer Jane Hulse was just one of many hikers who did just that the 
last couple of weekends. She was taking notes and oohing and aahing over the 
blooms for this week's Centerpiece story and photo spread on the county's 
wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really like to hike, but I have never paid that much attention to the 
wildflowers," she said. "But I was bowled over this year, amazed at the number 
of different wildflowers out there. I expected to see 10 or 12 varieties, but 
there were 50 or 75 different types in just one part of the Santa Monica 
Mountains." 
</P>
<P>
 Included in today's Centerpiece package are glorious photos by free-lance 
photographers Bruce Huff and Jerry Mennenga, as well as a map that pinpoints 
the state and national park areas where wildflowers have been spotted. And we 
list some of the many flowers that rangers and botanists have seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would really recommend to people who like to hike to get out there and see 
the flowers," Hulse said. "But don't expect to be knocked over by big fields of 
color, although you might get lucky and see some of that. More often, it is 
going to be plants here and plants there. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they are spectacular." 
</P>
<P>
 And while some of you are getting back to nature, others might be rebelling 
against it, especially after reading this week's Fashion column, where 
free-lancer Kathleen Williams tells us about the comeback of metallic fashions. 
If neither clomping through coreopsis or slipping into a silver pump does it 
for you, then Julie Sawyer, who wrote this week's Shop Talk column, tells you 
where to find a lovely, cool rayon dress at a good price. Get it in a floral 
print and combine nature and fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, this is spring, when anything is possible.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: MALL NEGOTIATIONS IN CARSON NOW HEADED IN THE RIGHT 
DIRECTION -- SORT OF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 KISS AND MAKE UP: Last January, the owners of the South Bay Pavilion in Carson 
were none too happy with the behemoth that proposed to become their neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson Mall Partners, owners of the pavilion, sued the city of Carson over the 
Metro 2000 project, a 180-store outlet mall planned just across the San Diego 
Freeway. Carson Mall Partners wanted to block the project, fearing that 
bargain-hunters would create a traffic chokehold. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, all is better in the land of Ikea. A settlement is near. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some things have been agreed upon and pretty well worked out," said City 
Administrator Lawrence G. Olson. "Nothing has been signed. It's headed in the 
right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 The city approved the sprawling complex in December and agreed to fund about 
$17 million in infrastructure, such as roads and sewers, Olson said. The 
developers of Metro 2000, meanwhile, are responsible for coming up with a plan 
to clean up the site, which is a former toxic waste dump. 
</P>
<P>
 But a separate environmental impact study on Metro 2000 failed to take into 
account potential traffic problems along Avalon Street, according to Carson 
Mall Partners' lawsuit. Among the group's demands during the subsequent 
settlement negotiations: an extra cloverleaf on-ramp to the northbound San 
Diego Freeway, said Mayor Michael I. Mitoma. 
</P>
<P>
 "We said 'That is nuts,' " Mitoma said. "We can't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the city has agreed to have an extra lane added to the northbound 
ramp to the freeway, which is subject to Caltrans approval, Mitoma said. 
</P>
<P>
 So what was gained out of all of this? 
</P>
<P>
 "Several thousand dollars in legal fees were spent," Mitoma said. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for Carson Mall Partners didn't return phone calls. 
</P>

<P>
 ATTENTION AL GORE: No Tupperware, no snow cone. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Tuesday, those might as well be the orders that students at Arlington 
Elementary School in Torrance get from the school's eco-conscious 
Parent-Teacher Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 On what the school calls "Trashless Tuesdays," all students have to bring 
lunch without plastic bags or any item that would create trash. Parents monitor 
the kids as they eat their lunch to make sure they are following the rules. The 
reward: a snow cone to all students who follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get kids to get creative when it comes to trash," said Joey 
Sheldon, the PTA's environmental co-chairwoman. "But you have to give them an 
incentive." 
</P>
<P>
 To be trash-free, kids carry food in plastic containers and lunch buckets and 
boxes, and their parents give them the family silverware as eating utensils, 
Sheldon said. Students who don't bring their lunch aren't eligible, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school has other environmental events in the works for Earth Day on April 
22. In addition to the old standards like tree planting, students will make art 
sculptures out of trash. Last year, entries included dinosaurs and a flower 
sculpture made from plastic soda bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 But the "Trashless Tuesdays" have had the greatest impact, helping cut waste 
in half on those days, Sheldon said. Of course, students still have to discard 
the paper holder from the snow cones. 
</P>
<P>
 Students "nag us about that, 'You're not recycling,' " Sheldon said. "But the 
paper holder is it. If they want straws or napkins, we tell them 'no-no.' "

 EVE OF DESTRUCTION: "Gardena's Councilman Fukai Threatens Destruction of 
Treasurer." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the headline on a press release that Gardena City Treasurer Lorenzo 
Ybarra sent out last week following a recent encounter with Councilman Mas 
Fukai, who is running for reelection. (Ybarra supports one of Fukai's 
opponents, Steven Bradford). 
</P>
<P>
 In the release, Ybarra said that Fukai came up to him after a candidates' 
forum on March 29 and yelled "I am going to destroy you!" and then "I am going 
to get you! You have been giving people information!" 
</P>
<P>
 Fukai, however, denies Ybarra's version of the meeting.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's silly," he said. "I've been on the council for 20 years, and it's the 
silliest thing I have ever heard." 
</P>
<P>
 Fukai said that he talked to Ybarra after the meeting, but only to dispute 
Ybarra's account of city finances. Ybarra said that an independent audit showed 
Gardena lost $1.2 million in the general fund in 1993 and $2 million in 1992. 
Fukai challenges that, saying the city is in much better financial shape. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the two aren't talking to one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he wants to get press, he should be able to get better press than this," 
Fukai said. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER: The Terraces, a mammoth center in Rancho Palos Verdes, 
was renovated five years ago, with a new white paint job, teal awnings and a 
maze of walkways. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem was, many shoppers had a tough time finding the shops. Now the Western 
Avenue center is two-thirds empty, with Trader Joe's and a movie multiplex 
among its only tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to an auction earlier this month, The Terraces may be getting a new 
lease on life. The winning bidder, an as-yet unidentified investment group, 
bought the center for $9.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The new owners "feel they got a good value based on the price," said Grubb &

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: NEW BAND BANGS OUT SOLID SOUNDS; FENDER BENDERS PLAYERS ARE 
VETERANS OF TOP LOCAL GROUPS WHO ARE AIMING FOR AUDIENCES THAT WILL APPRECIATE 
THEIR ARTISTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Every time you turn around, it seems, somebody is joining or leaving Sky King, 
one of the area's most popular country bands. This time, none other than 
founding-member Dan Wilson, the group's bass and mandolin-player, hit the 
turnstile. 
</P>
<P>
 But the good news is that Wilson and three outstanding fellow veterans on the 
local music scene have formed a new band. They call themselves the Fender 
Benders, taken from an old song title and in honor of their Fender Telecaster 
guitars, considered the country electric guitar of choice. And you couldn't ask 
for two better guitar pickers than Jim Monahan and Lee Rollag. Stir in the 
solid, infectious rhythms laid down by Bob Nichols, and you have a pretty good 
recipe for success. 
</P>
<P>
 I caught the Fender Benders' first public performance last week at Cousin's in 
Simi Valley. And after only four rehearsals, it was evident that the band has a 
lot of promise. They passed the "danceable test" with flying colors, had great 
vocal harmonies and the music was very well received. 
</P>
<P>
 Monahan, formerly of Caught Red Handed and more recently Chris Hillman's 
disbanded Desert Rose Band, carries most lead vocals. Rollag toured with Roger 
Miller and just finished a stint with Sarah Pierce and the Healers. The two 
alternate on lead and backup guitar. Rollag also plays fiddle and sings a few 
numbers. And his use of pedal licks on backup guitar creates a rich, 
traditional country sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's lead vocals are a nice contrast to Monahan's deeper sound. And 
Wilson's refreshing interpretation of "Red Neck Girl" proved his theory that 
it's possible for a musician to revamp a cover tune and still please the 
dancers -- something he's been struggling with for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that country music has gone down hill considerably since Billy Ray 
Cyrus just four years ago," Wilson said. "It's nothing more than a 
formula-based thing churning out songs while they can. And I just can't cater 
to the people who want us to be human juke boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real hard decision to leave a good working band, and I think the 
world of the talents in Sky King." 
</P>
<P>
 But circumstances made the other musicians available at the same time, Wilson 
said, so he decided to "give it a shot for personal growth." 
</P>
<P>
 "Fender Benders is going to be capable of playing a lot of different styles of 
music because of the talents of these musicians," he said. "We're looking for 
an audience who wants to come see and hear good music, and if they come to also 
dance, that's great. But we don't want them to forget the artistry of live 
music performed by seasoned artists. We'll be a band that is able to do Top 40 
country. But we'll also choose our songs carefully, have fun with original 
material." 
</P>
<P>
 One original tune, "I'll Never Let It Show," which was written by Monahan and 
singer Jill Michaels, is No. 7 on the charts in Europe. "Hopefully she'll jump 
on board with us when her tour is finished; but it's too early to tell," 
Monahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said the decision to seek newer creative pastures came one night when 
Sky King was playing at a local club. A tape was put on so that the band could 
go on break and the dancers applauded the boom box. 
</P>
<P>
 "What good does it do to practice your craft for years and learn to play an 
instrument if people just want it to sound like the radio? Where's the artistry 
and ability to interpret the music?" Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: The Fender Benders. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Sunday, 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Nicholby's, 404 E. Main St., Ventura, 653-6488.

KILLINGS THRUST MARYMOUNT INTO SPOTLIGHT; EDUCATION: SMALL, CLOSE-KNIT COLLEGE 
TRIES TO COPE AFTER SLAYINGS OF ITO AND MATSUURA. SOME STUDENTS EXPRESS CONCERN 
ABOUT SAFETY, LACK OF ON-CAMPUS HOUSING.

<P>
 For college officials, it's the stuff of nightmares: Just as high school 
seniors are mailing in their applications, two current students are fatally 
shot in a case that sparks international notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
 That is what happened two weeks ago to Marymount College, a small, two-year 
liberal arts school on a picturesque hilltop campus on the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 One day after Marymount's annual open house for prospective students, two 
first-year students from Japan were gunned down in an apparent carjacking in a 
San Pedro supermarket parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The college was thrust onto center stage of an international incident. 
Marymount's name appeared on front pages of newspapers around the world. News 
crews stood vigil at the campus gate, and 17 television cameras were on hand 
for a college press conference a few days after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy hit especially hard at Marymount because of the college's small, 
close-knit character, faculty and students said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are devastated by this event. Our students are devastated by it," 
Marymount College President Thomas M. McFadden told reporters at the press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura were declared dead two days after being shot March 
25 outside a Ralphs supermarket where many Marymount students shop. The two 
men, who came to the United States to study film, were 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, an 18-year-old San Pedro man, Raymond Oscar Butler, was charged 
in the case with two counts of murder, two counts of robbery and two counts of 
carjacking. Alberto Vasquez Reygoza, 20, of Long Beach, was charged with being 
an accessory and receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the mourning on campus last week, college administrators had to deal 
daily with the Los Angeles Police Department, the Japanese Consulate, the press 
corps, the grieving families, worried parents of other students and distraught 
classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Marymount officials stressed to reporters that the shootings did not occur on 
the Rancho Palos Verdes campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing the college could have done would have prevented that event, in that 
spot," McFadden said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tragedy did underscore the absence of on-campus dormitories at 
Marymount, which houses about 280 students in four apartment buildings in San 
Pedro. Some students said they are newly wary of crime in the San Pedro area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd much rather be in Palos Verdes," said Danielle Salice, a 19-year-old 
student from Oahu who lived in the same San Pedro residence hall as Ito. Her 
father telephoned Marymount officials last week to express concern about 
security, Salice said. "He was scared for me to come back to school." 
</P>
<P>
 The harbor area encompassing San Pedro, Harbor City and Wilmington saw a 14% 
decrease in crime between 1992 and 1993, and was one of the lowest crime areas 
in the city, said Officer Jeff Hamilton, a Los Angeles Police Department patrol 
supervisor in the San Pedro area. 
</P>
<P>
 Marymount sent a letter March 30 to parents, reassuring them "that the College 
has done, and is doing, everything possible for the safety of its students." 
Parents were told that locks have been replaced at college residences and 
garages. An LAPD officer has been talking to students about safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Some administrators said they would prefer to house students on campus but 
they doubt Rancho Palos Verdes would grant permission for dormitory 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the college had to agree to limit its enrollment in exchange for city 
approval of plans to expand campus buildings. The city also ordered the college 
to change its outdoor lighting after neighbors complained about glare. 
</P>
<P>
 On-campus housing would not have prevented the shootings of Ito and Matsuura, 
officials said, noting that the Ralphs is one of the closest supermarkets to 
the school. They added many students enjoy living in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Heightening the emotional turmoil at Marymount was the wave of international 
interest, as many news outlets portrayed the shooting as emblematic of violent 
crime in America. Japanese newspapers printed editorials with headlines such 
as, "We're Fed Up with Tragedies in the Society of Guns." It was the type of 
publicity that no college enjoys, especially when 24% of the 750 full-time 
students come from foreign countries, including 70 from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Images of carjackings and guns are at odds with a Marymount catalogue showing 
bucolic views of oceanside cliffs, flower-filled meadows, soaring sea gulls 
and, on the cover, a young couple walking hand in hand in the surf at sunset. 
</P>
<P>
 Admissions officials said they will not know until early summer whether the 
publicity has affected the number of applicants, but this week they were 
cautiously optimistic. Kevin O'Connor, assistant director of admissions, said 
he knows of no applicant who has withdrawn specifically because of the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans are under way for four separate campus memorials for the slain students. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito and Matsuura will be designated honorary graduates of Marymount at 
graduation ceremonies in May. The college will renovate a classroom in their 
honor and two trees will be planted in their memory. 
</P>
<P>
 An endowed lecture series on film will be launched during the next school year 
in honor of the students, paid for with memorial contributions. The school has 
so far received $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 McFadden said he suggested to the students' parents that the series be devoted 
to classical Japanese films. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'They said, 'Oh, no, don't do that. Have it on American films,' " McFadden 
said. After all, it was American movies such as the work of Steven Spielberg 
that so fascinated the two young men and brought them to America. Marymount 
College 
</P>
<P>
 The fatal shootings of two Marymount College students in San Pedro on March 25 
focused international attention on the small, two-year liberal arts college in 
Rancho Palos Verdes: 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollment: 750 full time, 325 in separate weekend program. 
</P>
<P>
 Faculty: 53 full time, 28 part time. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus: 26 acres at Palos Verdes Drive East and Crest Road. 
</P>
<P>
 History: Founded 1932 in Los Angeles as two-year college for women. Began 
admitting men in 1972. Moved to present campus in 1973.

10-YEAR TRAFFIC PLAN TO EASE CONGESTION GETS THE GREEN LIGHT; TRANSPORTATION: 
SIGNALS WILL BE SYNCHRONIZED ON FOUR MAJOR STREETS IN THE SOUTH BAY. FIRST 
PHASE OF THE PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY END OF THE YEAR. 
</P>

 South Bay drivers spend 4 million hours a year waiting in traffic on four 
major thoroughfares, transportation officials say. But they add that drivers 
can look forward to faster, less congested trips on major streets as the first 
phase of a 10-year traffic plan begins this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic signals will be synchronized on four arterials over the next two 
years, said officials from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Work is expected to be completed on Western Avenue between Pacific Coast 
Highway and the 105 Freeway by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic lights then will be coordinated on Pacific Coast Highway and Hawthorne 
and Sepulveda boulevards by July, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-year plan will coordinate 300 intersections on major arterials and 
supporting routes operated by 19 South Bay cities, Caltrans and Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial improvements mean red-light delays will be shorter and average 
rush-hour speeds will increase 3 to 5 m.p.h., said Victor Kamhi, manager of the 
South Bay Traffic Signal System Improvements Project.  
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the project is to get all of the cities to agree on some (signal) 
cycle times . . . and it's timed so when you go from one light, to the next and 
the next, you're constantly hitting green instead of constantly hitting red," 
Kamhi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coordinating signals is considered the best way to cope with traffic volumes 
that have increased dramatically in the South Bay since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 In that time, traffic on Western Avenue has doubled from an average of 20,000 
to 40,000 vehicles a day.  
</P>
<P>
 On Hawthorne Boulevard, one of the busiest arterials in the county, traffic 
was 40,000 to 60,000 vehicles per day in 1977. Now it is 50,000 to 70,000. 
</P>
<P>
 At half of the major intersections in the South Bay, traffic is at a virtual 
standstill for at least an hour a day, according to a survey completed in 
January.  
</P>
<P>
 After the first phase of the plan is completed, traffic delays are expected to 
be cut each year by 400,000 hours on the four identified arterials. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-year plan will incorporate message systems, surveillance and expanded 
signal centers so facilities at Long Beach, Torrance, Gardena and Los Angeles 
can exchange information on changing road and traffic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "South Bay drivers will be able to move around the way they want to move 
around without building new freeways. We can't build new freeways. We don't 
have any room," Kamhi said.

SOUNDS: WEEK OF HIGH NOTES IN CLASSICAL CONCERTS; THE OUTSTANDING EVENTS COULD 
MAKE THIS THE HIGHLIGHT OF VENTURA COUNTY'S MUSICAL YEAR.

 As the concert season lurches into spring, classical music offerings around 
Ventura pick up the pace. This coming week may, in fact, be the strongest of 
the year, in terms of recommendable options for concert-goers. 
</P>
<P>
 Between programs by Los Robles Master Chorale, along with the Conejo Symphony, 
and two separate Ventura County Symphony concerts, there's no lack of worthy 
excuses to get out of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday and Sunday in Thousand Oaks, Los Robles Master Chorale (formerly 
the Moorpark Master Chorale) will undertake its most ambitious program of the 
year. Abetted by the Conejo Symphony's orchestral forces -- as it was in 
concert a year ago -- the master chorale's director, James Stemen, will lead 
his group in performances of Haydn's "Te Deum" and, as the epic centerpiece, 
Beethoven's Mass in C Major. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beethoven performance will be a public local warm-up for the master 
chorale's tour of Britain this summer, when it plays a part in the 
International Church Festival at Coventry Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This has been a season of anticipation for the Conejo Symphony, which makes a 
substantial move next year from its current concert home on the Cal Lutheran 
campus to the new Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza Auditorium. For its 34th 
consecutive concert season beginning in October, the Conejo Symphony, led by 
Elmer Ramsey, will make the arts compound safe for classical music. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the symphony organization released news of its first season in the 
complex. Besides making a notable venue change, the symphony has increased its 
concert season -- from five to seven performances. 
</P>
<P>
 The guest artists come from different corners of the map, from the light stuff 
of Victor Borge and Shirley Jones -- the first and last concerts, respectively 
-- to pianists Daniel Pollack and Vladimir Feltsman, violinist Glenn Dicterow 
and baritone Sylvester Blue. The Feb. 11 program will be devoted to the music 
of composer-patron saint Gordon Getty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This week also finds not one, but two Ventura County Symphony concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 On the regular subscription series, we find a program under the title "Amadeus 
Plus," a mostly Mozart evening Saturday at the Oxnard Civic Auditorium. Young 
Hong Kong-born pianist Angela Cheng, winner of the Montreal International Piano 
Competition, will tackle Mozart's Piano Concerto in A Major, K. 488. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the program are Mozart's "Haffner" Symphony and Max Reger's Variations 
& Fugue on a Theme by Mozart. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're on the lookout for some serious non-European music diversion, head 
over to the Spanish Hills Country Club -- of all places -- where the final of 
three concerts in the exciting Music Alive! series will take place Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 This program, under the heading of "India Alive!," continues with the series 
concept of matching world music with contemporary composition. On the program 
will be Ravi Shankar's Sitar Concerto With Orchestra, conducted by Boris Brott. 
The CalArts Multicultural Instrumental Ensemble, led by Amiya Dasgupta, will 
perform Dasgupta's "Sur-O-Chanda" ("Melody and Rhythm"). 
</P>
<P>
 This series looks to be easily the most provocative new wrinkle in the 
county's cultural agenda this season. The idly curious and the committed are 
well-advised to check it out. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Sooner than we think, the Ojai Festival hits town, bringing with it the 
county's obvious musical apex -- at least in terms of international profile. 
Whatever programmatic waxing and waning the Ojai Festival can be accused of in 
the past several years, it refuses to be pedestrian or predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 That first weekend of summer in Ojai is a reliably fine way to kick off the 
summer and cap off the official concert season. 
</P>
<P>
 This June 3 to 5, Ojai veteran Michael Tilson Thomas takes the reins and the 
podium. The five-concert weekend program, for this festival, runs an unusually 
wide gamut across history and style. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will include music by Mahler, Brahms, Astor Piazolla, Stravinsky 
(the unofficial saint of Ojai), Varese, Schubert, Takemitsu, and on and on. 
Saturday night's concert will be a two-piano recital, featuring Thomas and 
Ralph Grierson, of music by John Cage, Lou Harrison, Nicolas Slonimsky and 
others. Featured guest artists will include renowned baritone Thomas Hampson 
and flutist Paula Robison. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' return to Ojai -- his seventh time here -- signifies a sense of full 
circularity. He appeared in Ojai as a young up-and-comer beginning some 25 
years ago. Now in a healthy mid-career, he will come with experience as the 
former conductor of the London Symphony, founder of the New World Symphony 
(which will be featured in Ojai) and, beginning in the fall, as music director 
of the San Francisco Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 Can we, chauvinistically, claim him as an honorary son? Details

GANGS TELL CANDIDATES NO. 1 CONCERN IS JOBS; POLITICS: 10 HOPEFULS IN CARSON'S 
ELECTIONS FIELD TOUGH QUESTIONS FROM COALITION MEMBERS WHO CREATED TRUCE.

<P>
 Tattooed Carson gang members with close-shaven heads, white T-shirts and baggy 
pants bunching over their shoes sat in chairs in the middle and back rows. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates dressed for success were lined up in a row at the front of the 
community room. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not a run-of-the-mill candidates forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of four Latino gangs who created a truce more than a year ago 
sponsored the Monday evening meeting. The coalition, known as the Harbor Area 
Action Committee, invited candidates running for mayor, City Council, treasurer 
and city clerk in Tuesday's election. The response was impressive -- only city 
clerk candidate Samson C. Labasan did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60 area residents, including 40 gang members, turned out to ask 
questions of the 10 candidates.  
</P>
<P>
 The gang members called for community centers and tutoring for dropouts who 
return to school. But most of all, they wanted to know which of the candidates 
could find them jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 Coni Hathaway and Gayle L. Konig, both running for City Council seats, 
ventured to answer. "I'm not promising," Hathaway said. "There is no council 
person that can guarantee jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Konig cautioned that developing jobs could take time. "I don't think it's 
going to happen tomorrow," she said. "The bottom line is that a lot of people 
here aren't educated enough to take (many) jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates emphasized the importance of education and vocational training. 
A few tried to describe the intricacies of their jobs in city government, but 
when the discussion focused on whether or not retailer Ikea's sales-tax revenue 
was proprietary information, their audience, composed mostly of young men, got 
restless.  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to know about Ikea. We want to know about us," gang member 
Aaron Mora said in an exasperated tone. 
</P>
<P>
 When Keith McDonald, a council candidate and former professional football 
player, talked about his off-season training programs in local parks, he got a 
strong reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know nothing about this in the Mexican neighborhoods," Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
 The session started about 45 minutes late because many gang members were wary 
of entering the Carson Community Center, which is in the same block as the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department station. 
</P>
<P>
 But after it got started, the meeting lasted three hours.  
</P>
<P>
 Like moderators at other political gatherings, Eugene A. Uriasand other forum 
organizers struggled to move the meeting along. "People kept talking and taking 
too long," said Urias, whose family has belonged to a Keystone area gang for 
two generations.  
</P>
<P>
 The gang members might not appear to have a lot of political clout, since many 
of them are too young to vote or are ineligible for various reasons to cast 
ballots. But the Harbor Area Action Committee has emerged as a viable community 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the group have been meeting since their truce began, and continue 
to organize in their neighborhoods. The group, which represents about 600 gang 
members, has sponsored football and baseball games, barbecues and a car show. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got tired of us fighting against each other. We want to get involved with 
our city -- and get programs for our young people," said gang member Rudy 
Viveros. "I've got a kid now, and I want it to be better for my son." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently the truce does not extend beyond the four Latino gangs that claim 
about one-third of Carson's neighborhoods, Mayor Michael I. Mitoma said. Urias 
said he would like to see other gangs eventually included in programs that the 
coalition hopes to start. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we have everything set up with the city, we're going to reach out to 
other gangs," Urias said, adding that everyone would be welcome at the teen 
centers that Action Committee members hope to create. 
</P>
<P>
 Since December, the gang members have worked with Mitoma and Arthur Caracoza, 
chairman of the city's Human Relations Commission, organizing crews to paint 
over graffiti and discussing what the city can do to help their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayoral candidate James H. Peoples said he was pleased to see more interest in 
politics by any group, but he questioned Mitoma's new-found interest in helping 
the gang members, since he has been on the council for seven years.  
</P>
<P>
 "My concern would be, why, after seven years, did we wait until two months 
before the election to talk with the gang members? . . . It appears to me that 
our elected officials are trying to use them for political ends." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitoma said that by demonstrating their sincerity through the truce and other 
activities, the leaders of the Action Committee had gained credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came to me -- I didn't go to them," Mitoma said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Viveros credited Mitoma with coming to coalition events and meeting with gang 
members to discuss their needs. "He does a lot of things for us," Viveros said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, he wasn't counting on getting any real results from the 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, it's election time . . . some of these people -- they're just out 
for the votes," he said.

POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: CANDIDATE FINDS A WALK IN THE PARK CAN BE ANYTHING BUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FIRSTHAND ACCOUNT: Gardena mayoral candidate Philip Johnson was not injured 
last week when shots were fired as he and a friend confronted gang members 
loitering in Rowley Park. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the March 30 incident demonstrates the city's Police Department is 
slow to respond to calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he and a friend were talking in the parking lot when they noticed 
about a dozen gang members smoking and drinking alcohol nearby. When they asked 
the youths to leave, one youth reportedly punched Johnson's friend, himself a 
former gang member. As several other youths threw rocks and swung baseball bats 
and golf clubs, Johnson said he tried to pull his friend away. 
</P>
<P>
 Then two shots rang out and Johnson and his friend ran to the park's gym. No 
one saw who fired the gun and no one was wounded, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said it took several calls to police from park staff, other witnesses 
and Johnson before officers arrived on the scene. All the gang members had 
disappeared by the time police arrived, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still nervous from it . . . and the more I've talked about it, the more 
afraid I've gotten," Johnson said at a candidates' forum March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 But Police Chief Richard Propster wrote in a report that the police dispatch 
computer recorded a call from a Rowley Park employee at 6:05 p.m. and the first 
two-officer unit was dispatched at 6:07, arriving at the park by 6:10 p.m. Two 
backup units were also dispatched, for a total of six officers sent to the 
scene, according to Propster's report. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the above, I feel police response was completely consistent with all 
expectations we have given to the community," Propster wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson said the response still was not within the three-minute time often 
promoted by city leaders, and he criticized what he deemed the need for several 
calls to get police to respond. 
</P>

 LEFT UNSAID: Several seconds of footage from an El Segundo City Council 
candidates' forum have been left on the city cable channel's cutting room 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to two protests filed at City Hall, the Community Cable Advisory 
Committee voted 5-1 to edit out a remark made by challenger Gerhardt Van Drie 
before the debate made it to El Segundo residents' living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Drie said during the March 23 forum that state Department of Social 
Services investigators found 17 children in a "shed" behind the home of Janice 
Wise, the sister-in-law of incumbent J.B. Wise. 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Wise ran a home day-care center in El Segundo. A report by the state 
Department of Social Services said the children were found in a "shed," but a 
later reference characterized the room as an "office." Her license to operate 
the center was temporarily suspended after investigators found 18 more children 
at her home than her license allows. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Wise, the brother of J.B. Wise, said Van Drie intended to defame his 
family's name and threatened legal action against the city if the comment was 
aired. Van Drie defended his remark, saying he was only repeating accounts of 
the incident in local newspapers. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 THE GREEN VOTE: During an election, there is a committee for every problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest: an environmental commission, an idea advanced by the four 
candidates for Manhattan Beach City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a city with commissions for parking spaces and public works, I'm very 
surprised we don't have a commission for the environment," said lawyer James A. 
Shalvoy, who is running for one of two seats on the council. Retired 
businessman Jack Cunningham also supported the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The two other candidates, lawyer Joan Jones and incumbent Connie Sieber, liked 
the idea as well, but said an independent citizen coalition may be more 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "However that happens, I'm for it," Sieber said. 
</P>

 UP AND COMING: The South Bay Republican Women Federated will hold a forum 
April 14 between Susan Brooks and Ron Florance, who are running in the

NIGHT LIFE: LIKE DEAD RINGERS FOR REAL THING; THE JURY IS STILL OUT ON WHAT 
KIND OF MUSIC MR. ECTOMY PLAY. BUT ALONG WITH CUBENSIS, THEY ARE A DEADHEAD'S 
DELIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL LOCEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Grateful Dead, who seem to be playing at fewer and fewer venues, may one 
day be relegated to playing in Jerry's back yard. Between increasingly 
infrequent gigs, what's a Deadhead to do, dude? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, since the chances of the real Dead returning to Ventura are roughly 
equivalent to a change in Elvis' EKG, then the gig at Midnight Hour on Saturday 
night is about as good as it gets for the groovy among us. Deadheads can swirl 
until their tie-dyed shirts become a kaleidoscope of color to the sound of Mr. 
Ectomy and Cubensis. 
</P>
<P>
 National acts such as Phish, Blues Traveler, the Spin Doctors and the Samples, 
while not Deadhead bands, do the extended jam thing and do attract Deadheads. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of those bands are actually struggling," Mr. Ectomy lead guitarist Smoke 
Le Bowl said during a recent phone interview. "There's only so much money out 
there, and none of those bands have had a commercial hit song. The big bands of 
the '70s such as Chicago, Tower of Power and Blood, Sweat and Tears all had hit 
songs, and even two or three hits on every album." 
</P>
<P>
 No big hits yet, but lots of fans for Mr. Ectomy and Cubensis, whose members 
are from around Southern California, but mostly the South Bay. The two bands 
play together a lot because they share the same keyboard player, Wake Rickman. 
</P>
<P>
 Other members of Mr. Ectomy sport equally dumb aliases that mom probably 
doesn't want to know about, such as Strings McGuildikutti, Le Bowl, Niccolai 
Pakalolo, Yoda, The Essence and others that are unprintable in a family 
newspaper. Depending on the night, there's up to 11 members in Mr. Ectomy, 
which makes it difficult to divide the six-pack of beer and small cold pizza 
that most club owners routinely lavish on a band. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many people in the band because none of us know how to play," 
lead singer McGuildikutti said. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury is still out on what kind of music it is Mr. Ectomy plays. They go 
fast, then slow; somebody sings, or everybody else sings; most dance around 
while others stare off into space, and the instrumental jams can be endless. 
</P>
<P>
 Music critics at Mr. Ectomy gigs have heard the influences of Frank Zappa, 
Oingo Boingo, Weird Al Yankovic, the Dead, Return to Forever, Pigface, Lynyrd 
Skynyrd, Jean-Luc Ponty and Third World. What, no Lawrence Welk? Just wait a 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of those weird musical comparisons are true -- we're the alternative of 
the alternative," Le Bowl said. "We use a lot of different styles in one song. 
We have polka songs, and we do a punk rock song with a jazz break. We even have 
tight little three-minute songs. We do a couple of cover songs and fake people 
out so we can get gigs. They think we're a reggae band." 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Ectomy isn't a reggae band (at least not all the time), but they do share 
the Rastafarian's love for buds, and not beer, either. Seemingly half of their 
songs have to do with smoking marijuana or looking for marijuana. Not 
surprisingly, Mr. Ectomy appears regularly at hemp rallies. 
</P>
<P>
 While Mr. Ectomy has no trouble squeezing into an outdoor rally, they do have 
trouble fitting on a stage in a bar. But according to McGuildikutti, they'd fit 
very well into a stretch limo when some record company finally forks over some 
cash. The band has a CD, a new live tape, a bunch of old tapes and a new CD in 
the works. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to get signed by the end of the year, but I think we're too scary for 
some people because there's so many of us in the band. But then again, it 
doesn't take much to make record company people nervous -- they want something 
that's safe. They probably don't like our name, either." Details

 Eric Werbalowsky gets paid to teach people to prepare "chocolate cake" for the 
"FBI." 
</P>
<P>
 Chocolate cake is what Werbalowsky calls the mixture of household and garden 
waste that he specializes in composting.And FBI, in this case, stands for 
fungus, bacteria and insects. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with state mandates to reduce the amount of waste going to landfills, 
Torrance and other cities rely on companies like Werbalowsky's Harmonious 
Technologies to teach people the fine points of creating a successful compost 
pile. 
</P>
<P>
 The city sells $50 compost bins at cost, picking up the expense of tax, 
shipping and seminars on how to use them. Last year the city sold more than 
600, including 30 that were bought as Christmas gifts, said Arlene Barco, the 
city's waste management coordinator.  
</P>
<P>
 The city will offer composting seminars at 10 a.m. Saturday and April 23 at 
Wilson Park, 2200 Crenshaw Blvd. Information: (310) 781-6900. MARY GUTHRIE

TOPICS / RELIGION; A WINDOW INTO LIFE OF AN ACTIVIST MINISTER; COMMEMORATION: 
ADMIRERS OF THE EPISCOPAL PRIEST RICHARD PARKER RAISE $18,000 FOR A 
STAINED-GLASS WORK AT THE HERMOSA BEACH CHURCH HE SERVED FOR 40 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rev. Richard Parker never shied away from controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 During the civil rights movement of the 1950s and '60s, the Hermosa Beach 
minister preached against segregation. When he saw young Vietnam War protesters 
camping out on the city's shores in the early 1970s, he founded a house where 
they could sleep. He spoke out against Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Parker died in 1991, parishioners and friends at St. Cross By The Sea 
Episcopal Church, where he ministered for 40 years, vowed he would be 
remembered. They pitched in $18,000 and, in January, installed a colorful 
7-foot-by-7-foot stained-glass window in the church chapel with Parker's 
friendly image at its center. 
</P>
<P>
 The window, with its deep azure blues and vibrant reds, offers a glimpse into 
a long, active life in Hermosa that began when a young, enthusiastic Parker was 
called to serve in the sparsely populated community in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear tell that in the 1940s any time a strange license plate went through 
town, (Parker) would track down the address and call on them to attend 
services," said the Rev. Paul D. Lawson, the priest at St. Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Parker had to abandon the practice when the city's population swelled, but his 
interest in the community never waned. When he retired in 1981, at the Anglican 
Church's mandatory retirement age of 72, he worked on the Presiding Bishop's 
Fund for World Relief until his death 10 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 The window's images reflect Parker's passions. On the left are depictions of 
the church, including a singing choir and an angel in prayer. On the right are 
scenes of the community, including images of the elderly and ill being cared 
for by the young and healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker, standing stately in the window's center, is the bridge where the two 
worlds meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always out doing something," said Margaret Parker, the priest's 
80-year-old widow, "and he always wore his collar." 
</P>
<P>
 During the polio epidemic of the 1940s, Parker would fire up his blue Ford 
coupe and drive an hour north to help care for patients in a Los Angeles 
hospital. Later, he worked to establish the South Bay Hospital, and founded the 
1736 House at 1736 Monterey Blvd. as a crisis center for anyone who needed 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, the Parkers raised three boys. And the minister never lost his 
sense of humor, Margaret Parker said. At a time when traditional titles were 
changing for church ministers, Parker frequently joked, "I don't care what you 
call me, as long as you call me when it's time to eat," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Parker's sense of humor that allowed him to take on hot topics in the 
community, Lawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The magic was that he was able to do all that he did and keep people from 
driving him out of town," he said. "He loved everyone."

THEATER REVIEW; CONEJO 'FOLLIES' NOT SAME OLD SONG, DANCE; THE SONDHEIM MUSICAL 
MAY HAVE FIZZLED ON BROADWAY, BUT THE LOCAL PRODUCTION SPOTLIGHTS THE SHOW'S 
STRENGTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not long after he decided to experiment with and develop the stagnant American 
musical comedy, Stephen Sondheim came up with "Follies." The 522 performances 
in its 1971 Broadway stand didn't make the producers any money, and attempts to 
revive "Follies" on Broadway and in London have also failed financially. 
</P>
<P>
 But "failure" is relative, and "Follies" is a fascinating experiment. And 
maybe the relatively low-key approach of the Conejo Players run, directed and 
choreographed by Kevin Calvin, emphasizes the show's strengths more than a 
big-time production would. 
</P>
<P>
 The show takes place in the present -- the 1971 present, that is, where the 
line "I don't trust music under 30" would have been a topical joke, and funny. 
Impresario Dimitri Weissman is staging a last reunion of singers and dancers 
who have performed as his "Weissman Girls" through the years; soon, the theater 
will be razed and replaced by a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Central to the show are two former chorus girls, Sally Durant and Phyllis 
Rogers. Roommates 30 years ago, they've retired from the stage, married and 
each has gone her own way. "Follies" combines the backstage story with a series 
of vintage-style production numbers. It's not all pretty -- this show is called 
"Follies" instead of "The Follies" for a reason. Passion between Sally and 
Phyllis' husband, Benjamin Stone, is rekindled with bittersweet results. 
</P>
<P>
 James Goldman's script at several points inserts "ghost" images of the 
principals acting simultaneously (although 30 years earlier than the onstage 
action). In practice, it's less complicated than it sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The most lasting legacy of "Follies" is the music: This is the score that 
produced "Losing My Mind" and the anthem-like, defiant "I'm Still Here." (One 
song dropped from the score before Broadway -- the double-entendre "Can That 
Boy Fox-Trot!" -- has become a standard among chichi cabaret singers.) 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the production numbers are tributes to Broadway and movies of the 
1920s through '40s; especially nice are a tap-dance extravaganza (choreographed 
by Tara Wilson) and the Busby Berkeley-styled "Loveland." 
</P>
<P>
 Starring in this production are Mariane Dibblee and Linda Stiegler as Sally 
and Phyllis, with Jenna Leigh Greenberg and Sumner Lynn Baltzer as their 
younger selves. Scott Mansfield and Wade Powers are the old and young 
incarnations of Sally's husband, Buddy, a traveling salesman with a roving eye. 
Ray Mastrovito and Tony A. Briant co-star as the old and young Benjamin Stone. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Bernath is Dimitri Weissman, and Eleanor Brand, Julie Prikjatel, Cathleen 
Drury and Susan Robb are featured in solo numbers; LaVerne Kaufmann is fun as 
the sort-of French chorus girl Solange LaFitte. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Pier conducts a large orchestra, replete with harp, bassoon and oboe, in 
addition to the usual brass, percussion and strings. Details

 Dorothy Sayers, creator of the Lord Peter Wimsey mysteries, once suggested 
that "the detective story will come to an end, simply because the public will 
have learnt all the tricks." She was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone is writing mysteries and conjuring up new tricks. And readers 
continue to be fascinated by books featuring professional or amateur 
crime-solvers who bring perpetrators of murderous acts to justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Mysteries to Die For, 2940 Thousand Oaks Blvd., Thousand Oaks, will play host 
to authors of two different interpretations of this popular genre. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Macleod, who is said to be the model for the Jessica Fletcher 
character in "Murder She Wrote," will sign her latest Peter Shandy mystery, 
"Something in the Water," published by Mysterious Press. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shandy series is considered a "softy, cozy" style of mystery writing. 
Macleod's 1 p.m. Friday appearance is considered rare because she lives in 
rural Maine. She is the author of more than 20 murder mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, author Ron Ely, also a film and television actor known for 
his Tarzan role on NBC, has penned his first book, "Night Shadows," published 
by Simon & Schuster. 
</P>
<P>
 Ely lives in Santa Barbara, as does his 'hard-boiled" protagonist, Jake Sands. 
The city becomes a dangerous paradise for Sands, who is being compared to 
classical suspense heroes Travis McGee, Lew Archer and Phillip Marlowe. 
</P>
<P>
 Ely has been commissioned to write two more Jake Sands novels, and he says 
they will be published shortly. Ely will be at Mysteries to Die For at 1 p.m. 
Saturday.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LAWNDALE; RECALL EFFORT TARGETING LAGERQUIST FAILS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Organizers of a drive to oust Lawndale Councilman Norm Lagerquist have failed 
in their bid to force a recall election. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Hesse, a leader of the movement, said she ran out of time to collect 
about 2,500 signatures needed to move forward with the petition.Supporters of 
the drive were given 90 days to submit the signatures to city officials, but 
failed to do so by the 5 p.m. Tuesday deadline, City Clerk Neil Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm relieved that I can get back to serving the people," Lagerquist said.  
</P>
<P>
 Hesse and others criticized Lagerquist for writing a letter on city stationery 
on behalf of a former campaign consultant convicted of lewd conduct with a 
12-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1992, Lagerquist wrote to a Long Beach Superior Court judge and 
asked for leniency in the sentencing of Timothy M. Carey, who pleaded no 
contest to three counts of committing lewd acts with a friend's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey, who faced a maximum of 12 years in prison, was sentenced to 180 days in 
County Jail, five years' probation and community service. 
</P>
<P>
 Lagerquist, who has apologized for using the city letterhead for personal 
business, defended his character reference.  
</P>
<P>
 "I chose not to abandon a friend who, in a moment of weakness, made a tragic 
mistake," Lagerquist said. "I in no way support what he did, but I did not 
believe his life and family should be ruined because of it." SCOTT SANDELL

<P>
 Kyle Kazan was fuming. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of a pot-bellied pig had read in a local paper that Redondo Beach 
was considering a ban on the animals this week.So he hoofed down to the council 
chambers Tuesday night determined to raise a stink. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not smelly animals, they're not loud," Kazan told the council. "Your 
dogs will bark much louder than pigs can oink." 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful of his concerns and those of other pet owners, the council Tuesday 
rejected a proposed law that not only would have banned more pigs, but also 
would have prohibited anyone from owning four or more pets (an aquarium would 
have counted as a single pet). 
</P>
<P>
 Kazan, who walks his pig Oink through town at least once a week, was in hog 
heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not very political, but I felt I had to come down because they were 
picking on pigs," said Kazan, 27. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they will handle future pet problems on a case-by-case 
basis. JAMES BENNING

COMMUNITY NEWS: HAWTHORNE; AGENCIES WILL HELP PAY FOR LOW-FLUSH TOILETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of Hawthorne can get help paying for the installation of toilets 
that use less water, under a program sponsored by the city and the West Basin 
Municipal Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 All residents are eligible for a $75 rebate from the district if they install 
ultra-low-flush toilets.Some residents -- for example, a family of four with an 
income less than $38,650 -- can get free toilets and installation, said water 
district spokesman Dave Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally speaking, low-income people don't take advantage of these kinds of 
programs because they can't afford the out-of-pocket expenses," Hill said, 
adding that many low-income homes have more people living in them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their usage is higher so their chance of conserving is higher," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,400 toilets are expected to be replaced in the program, which 
started Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The program for low-income households includes a free water-use survey. 
Plumbers will fix small leaks, install water-conserving shower heads and teach 
homeowners how to use less water inside and outside their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Old-style toilets typically use five to seven gallons of water per flush, but 
the toilets West Basin will install use only about 1.6 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill said the ultra-low-flush toilet should reduce consumers' water bills by 
20% to 25%, and reduce water use within the city by more than 14 million 
gallons a year. 
</P>
<P>
 This season's low rainfall could increase interest in water conservation, Hill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't get significant rainfall next winter you'll see rationing," he 
said. MARY GUTHRIE

COMMUNITY NEWS: TORRANCE; CITY LOOKS AT WAYS TO BRIDGE $5.3-MILLION GAP IN 
BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has agreed to consider several measures, including layoffs as 
a last resort, to remedy a $5.3-million deficit in next year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The measures, proposed by City Manager LeRoy J. Jackson, include a tax on each 
barrel of refined oil at Mobil Oil's Torrance facility, a business license fee 
for single-family rentals and duplexes, and a user tax on satellite dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 The council directed Jackson to determine whether the measures would be 
sufficient to eliminate the deficit before he acts on a proposal to delete 18 
vacant staff positions and fill 11 other vacancies by transferring employees. 
He had also proposed laying off six employees from the staff of 1,400. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said his staff would revise the 1994-95 budget within 45 days. The 
city anticipates spending about $102 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The council told Jackson to assume that the budget will include a pay raise of 
3% for city workers, their first increase in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Don Lee said he was concerned about giving a pay raise while 
layoffs were possible, but he said the raise might be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be in a situation where I can't retain and attract the kind 
of employees that I need to lead this organization," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee and Walker questioned whether imposing a $15 or $20 business license fee 
on single-family rental homes and duplexes might cost the city more in 
enforcement costs. The city already requires owners of rental property with 
three units or more to pay $15 per unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The council told Jackson to conduct more research on taxing satellite dishes. 
He had not determined what the levy might be. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax on production at the Mobil refinery could generate about $1 million 
annually, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's an idea whose time has come," said Councilwoman Maureen 
O'Donnell. She suggested a tax of $.045 per barrel, rather than the $.028 
suggested by Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobil would oppose the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "To help balance the city's budget on the back of one company certainly sends, 
we believe, the wrong message to any company interested in coming to Torrance 
as well as to those who are already here," company spokesman Barry Engelberg 
said in a statement Tuesday. MARY GUTHRIE

COVER STORY; THE LANGUAGE OF LEARNING; LENNOX SCHOOLS EARN HIGH MARKS FOR 
BILINGUAL PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA RICHARDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At first it seems puzzling, that educators from all over the United States and 
other countries admire, tout and study the Lennox School District. It is, after 
all, a district whose students consistently perform poorly on state 
standardized tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is Lennox itself, which does not seem a magnet for visitors. A port 
of entry for immigrants, Lennox has become a textbook example of a community in 
the grip of poverty, gangs and crime. Most of the children in the school system 
come from one-parent families. Some live in converted garages; others live in 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 So what are educators studying that cannot be seen in Lennox's test scores? 
</P>
<P>
 It's the district's success in teaching children -- who enter kindergarten 
speaking no English -- to speak, read and write in both English and Spanish by 
the eighth grade. It is largely for that accomplishment that Lennox Supt. 
Kenneth L. Moffett was chosen National Superintendent of the Year in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the district's entering students, 92% speak only Spanish.  
</P>
<P>
 "The research is very solid," Moffett said recently. "If the kids have a good 
foundation in Spanish then they can be successful. If they have poor tools in 
Spanish, then they develop poor tools in English, and the youngster is 
handicapped all the way through." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lennox School District can give the students a good foundation in Spanish 
because about 70% of the teachers are bilingual -- a higher percentage than any 
other district in the South Bay and one of the highest in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis on speaking Spanish affects every aspect of education in Lennox, 
Moffett said. Students see role models speaking English and Spanish fluently, 
and the message to children is that the knowledge they acquired in their first 
language is worthwhile and useful. And he added, the high percentage of 
bilingual personnel enables Spanish-speaking parents to more easily approach 
the school district or to help with their child's homework. 
</P>
<P>
 Another step that transformed the district was the implementation of a strict 
program of discipline. Every classroom displays a set of rules, consequences 
for violations and rewards for good behavior. Fights are rare. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Moffett instituted the program, fights were common. Discipline was 
uneven. One teacher might punish a student for chewing gum while another 
teacher would not. Some teachers might separate a fight and send offenders to 
class while others would send them to the principal's office -- an 
inconsistency that infuriated parents. Now every infraction of the rules is 
treated the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't had a call from a parent about a disciplinary problem in five 
years," Moffett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lennox fourth-graders have some of the lowest test scores in the state. But 
average test scores for students who finish eighth grade are only about 5% 
lower than the state average. The gap is made up, Moffett said, because English 
literacy is the most important goal in the district, and he has hired people 
who agree that it should be. Teachers, aides, secretaries, custodians -- all 
are on a clearly defined mission. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Moffett became superintendent 16 years ago, all Spanish-speaking students 
were taught by aides, and only three teachers in the district were bilingual. 
</P>
<P>
 Moffett accomplished the 70% level of Spanish-English bilingualism in the 
district with a rigorous training program for teachers and a requirement that 
all newly hired employees speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers who were not bilingual were encouraged to learn Spanish, and 
bilingual aides were encouraged to become teachers. In the last five years, 35% 
of teachers hired were once teaching assistants. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the district made a deal with UCLA and Loyola Marymount: The 
universities prepared district aides and teachers for bilingual and teacher 
certification at no cost, and Lennox trained the universities' student teachers 
in district classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have worked very hard to make the language in the schools reflective of 
our clientele," said Moffett, who is one of the few district employees who is 
not bilingual. 
</P>
<P>
 Lennox lies just east of Los Angeles International Airport and north of 
Hawthorne. The 1990 Census put the city's population at 22,757 -- about 19,400 
of whom are Latino and 1,433 are black. The city also has small Filipino, 
Tongan and Vietnamese populations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tongan population is beginning to grow and the school district may have to 
offer more extensive bilingual services in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 The state requires that students with limited proficiency in English be taught 
major subjects such as science, math and social studies in their primary 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole aim is for them to learn English, but while they're taking the five 
to seven years it takes to think academically in a second language, they're 
still learning (other subjects)," said Norman Gold, manager for bilingual 
compliance for the state Department of Education. "It's not that teaching in 
the primary language is always the best answer for every child, but it's always 
the best starting point." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that parents who do not speak much English are more likely to become 
involved in their child's school and homework if the home language is used. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lennox, students who speak limited English are taught subjects in Spanish 
from kindergarten through third grade. Students take courses in both English 
and Spanish in fourth grade and are in English-only classes by fifth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 But long before their students make the transition to English-only classes, 
teachers in Lennox are using English in their lessons and in their classrooms. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It is the last day before spring vacation at Whelan Elementary school. Only an 
hour is left in the school day, and the second-graders in Lisa Falagan's class 
are fidgeting with excitement, talking and jumping out of their chairs to ask 
her questions.

 Falagan, a first-year teacher, is urging them to finish their final project, a 
timeline of important events in their lives, before vacation. As part of a 
social studies lesson on biographies, the children have written dates on the 
front of index cards and important events in their lives on the back.  
</P>
<P>
 Veronica Ochoa, 7, wearing a hat with a big carnation pinned in front, 
finishes early. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here is my timeline," she said in Spanish, flipping the cards to the year 
1987. On the back was written in English, "I was born!" 
</P>
<P>
 Falagan walks through the room, punching holes in the index cards and 
measuring string for the children to make necklaces of their work. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter of Cuban refugees, Falagan worked full time in the Lennox School 
District to put herself through college. Before becoming a teacher, she was a 
teaching assistant, a technician in the Whelan computer laboratory and a 
preschool instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 She is one of the teachers district officials point to with pride when they 
discuss the aide-to-teacher program. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lesson in biographies, the children also studied the lives of famous 
people, including Martin Luther King Jr., Shakespeare and Pablo Picasso. The 
lessons on Picasso were particularly popular. 
</P>
<P>
 First Falagan asked the children to draw a portrait of her. Then after 
teaching them about Cubism, she asked them to draw her portrait a la Picasso. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, this one's mine," said Veronica, pointing to a multi-nosed drawing. 
"Isn't it pretty?" 
</P>
<P>
 To drive home her lesson, Falagan, who lives in Long Beach, has been taking 
students, four at a time, to see the Picasso exhibit at the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 For the creativity and zeal Falagan displays in her teaching -- in school, 
after school and on weekends -- Whelan Principal Ken Knott is nominating her 
for district New Teacher of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Falagan's dedication is not unusual in the Lennox district. Teachers arrive 
long before the students do and stay into the evening to tutor, mentor and 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 For their dedication, the teachers are paid more than those in similar 
districts. Nearly 70% of the 216 teachers make more than $40,000 a year and, of 
those, 32% make more than $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We staff lean, but we pay teachers well," Moffett said. "We have to have 
something to attract people to come here."  
</P>
<P>
 At Lennox Middle School, the sports clubs have no funding for transportation, 
so the teachers, who volunteer to coach, also transport the students to and 
from games and often take them home afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Among its many activities, the school has a handball club, a drama club and a 
group that helps homeless people. Teachers take students to plays, to movies, 
sports events and museums, fighting to keep them off the streets and out of 
gangs. They stay late to help with homework or console a child who's having 
trouble at home.  
</P>
<P>
 But the activism sometimes takes its toll. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good place to work, but it can be hard, very hard," said physical 
education teacher Karen Korzelius. 
</P>
<P>
 At Lennox Middle School, she coaches the girls basketball team, teaches class, 
and takes kids to games. If their parents don't show up afterward, she takes 
them home. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I bought a Blazer when I traded in my Nissan pickup truck," she 
said with a sigh. "It has more room for the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Newly married, Korzelius is trying to balance her students' needs with her 
home life. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's not easy," she said. "I don't know if I can keep everything going." 
</P>
<P>
 Moffett's rule requiring Spanish speaking for just about anybody in the 
district who has to speak out loud is not always easy to follow, some 
administrators say. But most seem to agree with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's something that Dr. Moffett has been relentless on, which has been good 
for us as a district -- frustrating for me as a principal, but good," said 
Lennox Middle School Principal Larry Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people say that we cater too much to the necessities of our kids, but 
the majority of people here accept that bilingual education is the way to go," 
he said.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Head Counselor Pam Rector is often the last person to leave Lennox Middle 
School. It is her job to see that more Lennox students go to college. Even 
former students who are now in high school visit after school, and parents come 
when they get off work. 
</P>
<P>
 She often takes students to see college campuses.  
</P>
<P>
 "Unless kids can visualize themselves at a college, they can't get there," 
Rector said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before spring break, mentors from Loyola Marymount University, who tutor 
Latino students at the middle school several times a week, invited them to 
spend the day at Loyola and then sleep over. The program is called El Espejo, 
The Mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call it that because we hope they look at the college students and see 
themselves," Rector said. "In return, the tutors look at the kids and remember 
themselves at a young age." 
</P>
<P>
 Toting sleeping bags, the students arrived early in the morning, both boys and 
girls wearing the urban adolescent uniform of flannel shirts and loose jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 They were surprised to see so many Latinos on campus and to find out how much 
fun it was to be at college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that college would be, like, all work and homework and that the 
people would be, well, kind of geeky," said Danny Godoy, 13. "But they're nice; 
they're not racist at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Godoy's mentor is Juan Cueva, 18, an engineering major who graduated from 
Lennox Middle School and Hawthorne High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, it feels good to do something and give back to the community. I 
wouldn't be here if somebody had done it for me -- if it weren't for Pam 
(Rector)," Cueva said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cueva turned to Rector, even though he had left the district. Lennox schools 
only include kindergarten through eighth grade. After middle school, students 
attend Hawthorne High School, where Lennox counselors say their former students 
either have great success or tend to get lost in the crowd and drop out. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tell us that we coddle the kids and spoil them so that they're not ready 
for high school," Rector said. "We feel like they're just not as supportive as 
they should be of the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Lennox officials yearn to have a high school in the community but say there is 
no money to open one. So the Lennox staff tries to nurture the students from a 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Rector holds college application sessions for former students applying to 
college. She helped Cueva register for the Scholastic Aptitude Test, fill out 
college applications and apply for financial aid. Cueva is the first in his 
family to go to college. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Lennox students' recent overnight stay at Loyola, about 25 parents 
visited the school to see it and hear a talk by Latino officials urging them to 
keep their children focused on going to college. Financial aid is available, 
they stressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just marvelous," said Samuel Cruz, whose daughter, Marisol, an aspiring 
veterinarian, had spent the night. "I've never been to a college before." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting at the same table with Cruz were Maria and Alvaro Espinoza, 
eighth-grader Erica's parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is incredible," Maria Espinoza said in Spanish. "We could never even 
convince her to go spend the night at a cousin's house, she is so attached to 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now I see her walking around so comfortably and happy, it's very 
reassuring to me," Espinoza said. "Now I can really picture her coming here to 
the university." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Moffett's crusade to educate the children of Lennox is, in part, because he 
looks at them and sees himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Moffett's German grandparents immigrated to the United States and came West in 
a covered wagon, happy if they found enough food for the day, he said. His 
family settled in a small logging community in Washington state, and he grew up 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been on my own since I was 17, and I put myself through college," the 
58-year-old Moffett said. "I think I've always liked working with poor 
children. They're very honest. What you see is what you get." 
</P>
<P>
 Before becoming superintendent in Lennox, Moffett was assistant superintendent 
in Inglewood. He credits his experiences there with teaching him how to be 
comfortable with people of all races. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went through court-ordered desegregation there, and all the trials and 
tribulations of that," Moffett said. "I think that the first black students I 
had in Inglewood, I probably was uncomfortable. But then after that I was very 
comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 So he can appreciate when teachers or administrators are uncomfortable in 
Lennox, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is that some people are just really uncomfortable being in a 
minority district," Moffett said. "And I can understand when others are 
uncomfortable. It's my job to be willing to address that face to face and help 
those people. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can I help them? Well, I can help them find another district." 
</P>
<P>
 When he was a finalist for the National Superintendent of the Year Award, 
Moffett and three other superintendents flew to Washington to interview with a 
panel. To this day, he is not sure why he was chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, they asked me what I'm proud of," he said. "I told them that I'm most 
proud of the attitude we've been able to create here, because it's an area 
people could really give up," Moffett said. "And we don't."

 It's been months since Ryan Chase, 11, and Taylor Jeffs, 10, have seen a kids' 
movie they liked. This one was "pretty good," Taylor concluded with some 
surprise. He said the plot was easy to follow, there were ample chase scenes 
and enough humorous characters -- particularly the monkey. 
</P>
<P>
 But make no mistake: This isn't a movie for "kids of all ages"; it really is a 
movie specifically for kids. It zeros in on their world from their perspective. 
The girl lives with her mother, her stepfather and an initially despised new 
baby boy. She sees her dad on weekends, her room is a mess, she prefers TV to 
homework and has a "best friend" who has 25 other best friends. And, to boot, 
her parents think that she is lying when she isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The monkey earned "ahhhhhs" from the audience. He is a basically good monkey 
who -- even if he needs a little potty training -- can grasp the difference 
between right and wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked it when she was teaching him how to go to the bathroom," said Kevin 
Druffel-Rodriguez, 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Younger kids cracked up over a monkey in a diaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "The monkey was very cute," said 6-year-old Alexa Paolella, who went right 
home afterward to praise the movie to her friends on a computer service 
bulletin board. "My favorite part was when the baby started to talk and help 
Eva." 
</P>
<P>
 We should also mention a nice educational touch. In one scene, Eva takes the 
highly anthropomorphic monkey to the library, where they did research on his 
particular breed and its social life. Looking at her own blended family, Eva 
concludes that they are not too much different. 
</P>
<P>
 The film is a kids' comedy that parents can basically relax over, even if they 
doze off in the middle. At 95 minutes, it seems longer. (As the gold-toothed 
villainous Gypsy, Harvey Keitel still sports some facial tattoos, but "Monkey 
Trouble" isn't "The Piano.") 
</P>
<P>
 The one exception, a scene where the cute monkey brandishes a handgun and 
shoots at the villain, made some parents nervous. But that, of course, is 
exactly what some kids liked the most. The audience broke out in applause. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gun was the funniest part," Ryan said. "Like a monkey would do that. That 
just made it funny." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor liked the traditional car chase, in which a trailer becomes unhitched 
and heads for a park. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys said they see about five movies a month, adding that they were glad 
to see more kids' movies coming out, even though this one ranked far below 
their all-time favorites, "Home Alone" and "Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they said, it was better than another recent kids' comedy, "Blank 
Check." 
</P>
<P>
 "The story was more clear about what the plot was," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a lot more funny," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said the commercials for the movie had spoiled some of the best parts 
for him, but still there were some surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was just about a girl and a monkey," he said. "I didn't know it 
was about any other characters."

REEL LIFE / FILM AND VIDEO FILE; WARNER BROS. STUDIO STORE TO MAKE ITS DEBUT; 
THE SHOP, ONE OF 60 LAUNCHED SINCE 1991, WILL BE OPEN FOR BUSINESS FRIDAY AT 
THE OAKS SHOPPING CENTER.

<P>
 Looney Tune locals who want a Sylvester and Tweety letterman's jacket or a 
Road Runner golf shirt no longer have to cross the county line. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Warner Bros. will open a studio store at The Oaks shopping center 
in Thousand Oaks, one of 60 such stores launched since the first opened in 
Beverly Center in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The store at The Oaks will have some stuffed animals and about a couple dozen 
Looney Tunes titles on videocassette for the kids, but like the sly and ironic 
cartoons themselves, much of the store's merchandise has been created for 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Animation graces everything from coffee mugs to golf bags to sequined jackets 
that sell for several hundred dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 For around $10,000, you can even get original animation cels from such greats 
as Tex Avery, Friz Freleng and Wile E. Coyote creator Chuck Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner execs say that the overall response has been tremendous and that they 
expect to open 50 more stores this year as they heat up the challenge to steal 
a piece of the entertainment merchandising pie from Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 The enterprise is not without pitfalls. How long can it be before Warner is 
named in product liability suits for its ACME line of rocket-powered roller 
skates, hang gliders, etc? 
</P>

<P>
 Construction starts Wednesday on the Edwards Camarillo Movie Palace, a huge 
12-plex cinema slated to open on Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater is touted as having "state-of-the-art everything" from Dolby 
Stereo Surround Sound to cup-holder armrests. One innovation leaves us puzzled, 
though. A press release promises that the popcorn stand will feature "Real 
Butter" topping. 
</P>
<P>
 We're not sure how this differs from real butter (without capitals or 
quotation marks), and the Edwards spokesman was unavailable to explain whether 
the distinction is chemical or simply typographical. 
</P>

 The Ventura College Theater wraps up its Travel Film Series today with a 
presentation of Hal McClure's "Istanbul." 
</P>
<P>
 McClure was a reporter for the Associated Press and spent almost five years in 
Istanbul as the correspondent there. 
</P>
<P>
 McClure shows Turkey's strong links to its biblical past. The film visits 
Tarsus, hometown of St. Paul, early Christianity's leading publicist, and 
Ephesus, where the Virgin Mary is believed to be buried. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the tour is Myra, hometown of St. Nicholas, who was elected bishop 
there in the 4th Century before he was tapped as the folk legend Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura College is at 4667 Telegraph Road. Show time is 7:30 p.m. Admission is 
$7.50 in advance, $9 at the door. For information, call 654-6459.

 Students from Southern California and New England met through video hookup 
Tuesday as part of a coast-to-coast field trip comparing the areas' ecosystems. 
</P>
<P>
 During a live broadcast from Manhattan Beach- and Boston-area schools, the 
students examined shells and specimens collected from their coasts and compared 
them with the items shown across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Items from the West Coast included abalone shell, starfish, the California 
cowrie and the purple sea urchin. Items from the East Coast were lobster claws, 
skate egg cases, dried kelp and barnacles. 
</P>
<P>
 The event was sponsored by TEAMS Science, a national learning project in its 
fourth year. The group's goal is to improve literacy in mathematics and science 
through the use of technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Widdison, TEAMS science studio teacher, and Paul Erickson of the New

SCHOOL NEWS: HERMOSA BEACH; NEW PRINCIPAL FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Hermosa Beach City School District's new principal, Jan Hillger, never 
intended to teach. She caught the teaching bug not in the classroom, she said, 
but in the Peace Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 After 22 years in education -- the last nine in the South Bay -- Hillger was 
appointed principal of Hermosa Valley and Hermosa View schools. She will take 
over the schools, which teach kindergarten through eighth grade, on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 During her two-year tour of duty in the Peace Corps, Hillger taught math and 
science to third- and fourth-grade students in Malaysia. Although she spent 
five hours a day, six days a week for three months learning the Malay language, 
Hillger had to learn the local dialect on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillger's Peace Corps duty gave her enough experience to earn a teaching 
credential in California. She's been working in California public education 
ever since. After teaching elementary and intermediate school, Hillger switched 
to school administration, serving as dean of students at Palos Verdes Peninsula 
Unified School District and most recently as associate principal at Peninsula 
High School. JON GARCIA

 BOUNCING BACK 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Altenberg is living proof that you can't keep the good ones down. 
</P>
<P>
 The former UCLA receiver underwent an emergency heart transplant Feb. 17. Last 
week, barely six weeks after the operation at UCLA Medical Center, he announced 
he will help coach football next season at Serra High, his alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
 Altenberg, 50, will assist his son, Scott, who was hired as offensive 
coordinator. They are part of the staff being put together by Charles Nash, who 
was recently named Serra's coach after taking over the program midway through 
last season on an interim basis. Nash replaced Kevin Crawley, who was fired. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was lucky," said Altenberg, best known for catching the winning touchdown 
pass in the 1965 UCLA-USC game. "I recovered faster than most people. I've 
always kept in good shape. The doctors said the only thing wrong with me was a 
bad heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Altenberg's health took a turn for the worse when he caught a virus while 
visiting friends in Texas during Thanksgiving. The virus destroyed his heart 
muscle, making a transplant his only option for survival. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was fortunate that they found a heart early," he said. "The doctors at UCLA 
are wonderful. They can do anything with the heart. The hardest part is finding 
a donor." 
</P>
<P>
 Altenberg said he plans to participate in the Donor Awareness Program to 
educate the public on the needs of transplant patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ironic thing is that it's so simple," he said. "There are no negatives. 
It just takes 10 seconds to check the back of your (driver's) license. 
Hopefully more people will start doing that." COACH'S FIRING 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Brown, coach of the Redondo High girls' basketball team, was fired last 
week by Principal Bob Paulson, who cited "a philosophical difference" as the 
reason for the action. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's pretty much what it boils down to," Paulson told the Daily Breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to a source, the problem was not between Paulson and Brown. The 
source, who requested anonymity, said Paulson bowed to pressure from a small 
group of parents and school board members. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parents went to the board," the source said. "From what I hear, they were 
upset with (Brown's) handling of the girls. They accused him of cussing and 
verbal abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown declined to respond to the allegations. In five seasons as coach, he 
guided Redondo to four Southern Section playoff berths and a 60-65 record. The 
Sea Hawks increased their victory total in each season under Brown, winning 
four games in 1989-90 and finishing 17-9 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The firing) has nothing to do with his record," the source said. "He 
recently coached in that (South Bay) all-star game, so you know he's highly 
thought of. I just think some board members had it in for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He should have been put on probation instead of being fired. There were 
rumblings from parents (during the season), but they were pretty isolated." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who is considering an offer to coach boys' basketball at Redondo, said 
he is through with coaching girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based upon my experience in girls' basketball in the past five years, I have 
no interest in going back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown will continue to teach science at Redondo. ANOTHER LOSS 
</P>
<P>
 Meddling parents reportedly were the reason for the recent resignation of Rich 
Rosato, the longtime girls' basketball coach at North Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Several colleagues said Rosato's decision was based on problems he had with 
parents last season, when he guided North to an 18-7 record and a share of the 
Pioneer League title. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosato, who did not elaborate, said he felt it was time to step down. DUKE OF 
DUNK 
</P>
<P>
 Duke-bound Ricky Price of Serra High won the dunk contest at the prestigious 
McDonald's All-America basketball game last week in New York City, impressing 
judges with a 360-degree dunk on his last attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-6 Price didn't fare as well in the game. He finished with eight 
points for the West in a 112-110 loss to the East, but enjoyed meeting and 
playing with the nation's top seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great experience," he said. "Just to be there was an honor." 
</P>
<P>
 Price started for the West alongside another Duke recruit, guard Trajan 
Langdon of Anchorage, Alaska. Langdon won the three-point shooting contest, 
beating Jelani Gardner of St. John Bosco High and UCLA-bound omm'A Givens of 
Aberdeen, Wash., in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said he was thrilled that Duke reached the NCAA final. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was on the edge of my seat the whole time watching them," he said. "I can't 
wait to get there." BASKETBALL HONORS 
</P>
<P>
 Serra's Price and Inglewood junior Paul Pierce have been named to the elite, 
10-player All-Southern Section basketball team by members of the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, a 6-6 forward who led Inglewood to the Division II-A title, was 
runner-up to St. John Bosco's Gardner for Division II player of the year. 
Pierce was joined on the first team by senior guards Sam Turks of Inglewood and 
Shane Willis of Mira Costa. Senior guard Morgan Ensberg of Redondo was named to 
the second team. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division III, Bishop Montgomery senior guard Kareem Mutrie was named to the 
first team. In Division IV, Price was named to the first team and junior 
forward Leonard Butler of Serra and senior guard Matt Sabosky of El Segundo 
were named to the second team. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division V, Chadwick guard Neil Thakur was a first-team choice and his 
teammate, junior forward Todd Ammons, and Mary Star senior guard Tony DiLeva 
were named to the second team. NOTHING TO FEAR 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the San Pedro High softball team finished 26-3 and won its second 
consecutive City Section 4-A Division title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates are 11-2 this year entering today's Pacific League game against 
Carson at home, but San Pedro's nonconference record is of no concern to Coach 
Tony Dobra. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates' losses have come to Southern Section schools Bellflower and 
Bishop Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technically, we're behind last year in terms of losses," said Dobra, who lost 
eight players from last year's team because of graduation. "But if somebody 
told me before the season we would be 11-2, at this point I would be ecstatic." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates' leaders this season are seniors Petrina Martinez and Victoria 
Brucker, the 1993 City 4-A co-most valuable players. 
</P>
<P>
 Brucker has signed a letter of intent to San Jose State and Martinez has taken 
a recruiting trip to Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez and Brucker have helped San Pedro to a 33-game winning streak against 
City competition and a 57-10 record over three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez (3-2) won 14 games as a junior, but the Pirates have gone to a 
three-pitcher rotation this year with Tami Anderson (4-2) and Nicole DeLuca 
(3-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore outfielder Darlene Karacoza leads the team with a .500 average and 
juniors Alma Dorado and Michelle Spanjol are batting .450 and .368. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates, however, are seeking a replacement for third baseman Patty 
Palmas, who moved to Utah during spring break. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the opportunity to do well in the City playoffs if we continue to 
improve," Dobra said. "The seniors have an opportunity to be part of something 
special -- three titles in a row -- and I think once that sinks in we're going 
to be dangerous." BY INVITATION ONLY 
</P>
<P>
 The Morningside High girls headline a list of South Bay entrants in the 
invitational portion of the Arcadia/Foot Locker Track and Field Invitational 
Saturday night at Arcadia High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs will renew their rivalry with Long Beach Poly in the 400- and 
1,600-meter relays. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Jackrabbits posted national-leading marks of 45.59 seconds in 
the 400 relay and 3 minutes 42.75 seconds in the 1,600 relay. Morningside had 
the country's third-fastest time in the 1,600 relay at 3:44.93 and the No. 5 
time in the 400 relay at 46.57. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime Artzner and Molly Mehlberg of Peninsula will compete in the 1,600 and 
3,200 meters and run on the Panthers' distance medley relay team. THIS AND THAT 
</P>
<P>
 * Many of Southern California's top prep basketball players will participate 
in the second annual Nike Slam-N-Jam Grandeur-N-Glory Prep Cage Classic 
starting at 6 p.m. Friday at St. John Bosco in Bellflower. South Bay standouts 
expected to play in the doubleheader include Inglewood's Turks, Banning's Jason 
Pickett and Carson's Charles Perry and Tony Harvey. The team coached by 
Inglewood's Pat Roy in the 8 p.m. game will include Turks, Pickett and Kristaan 
Johnson of State Division I champion Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 * Peninsula High senior Traci Arkenberg, who led area girls' soccer players in 
scoring with 59 goals and 15 assists last season, has been named Southern 
Section Division I offensive player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore forward Michelle Kallas of Bishop Montgomery was named Division II 
offensive player of the year and Knight Coach Kit Schwartzman shared coach of 
the year with Tino Younger of El Modena. Bishop Montgomery was division 
champion. Peninsula was runner-up to Marina. ROB FERNAS and KIRBY LEE

JAUNTS; FISHING DERBY LETS THE WHOLE FAMILY ANGLE FOR LUCKY CATCH; LAKE PIRU 
DERBY EVENT IS OPEN TO EVERYONE FROM TODDLERS TO SENIORS. HOOK THE RIGHT FISH 
AND WIN $500. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you enter the Family Fishing Derby at Lake Piru on Saturday, you just might 
hook a trout worth $500. 
</P>
<P>
 Six trout stocked in the lake before the derby bear special tags. 
</P>
<P>
 Five are worth $100, and a sixth nets the angler a $500 prize. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't let your hopes get too high. In the three years Soroptimist 
International of Fillmore has sponsored the derby, no contestant has reeled in 
a tagged fish. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say they haven't walked away with some prizes. This year there 
are cash prizes of $100 each for fishermen 16 years and older who land the 
heaviest bass and trout, as well as the biggest catches of bass, trout and 
crappie. 
</P>
<P>
 Children in three age categories -- 12 to 15 years old, 6 to 11, and under 5 
-- could win a rod and reel for their catches. They also are eligible for cash 
prizes if they haul in a tagged fish. 
</P>
<P>
 The fishing is good now at Lake Piru, said Doug West, who manages the 
recreation area. Anglers are pulling in trout averaging 1.5 pounds and bass 
that range between 3 and 5 pounds. And the campground is open. 
</P>
<P>
 For the derby, fishermen can start fishing as soon as the gate opens at 6:30 
a.m. Children will weigh their catch at 2 p.m., and the adults at 3:30. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also try to give funny prizes, like for the biggest weed caught," said 
Sarah Hansen, chairwoman of the derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the fees to enter the derby: a family ticket (two adults and 
unlimited children) is $35, single adult ticket, $17; senior citizen, $10; 
youths 12 to 15 years, $12; 6 to 11 years, $6, and 5 years and under, free. You 
can register the morning of the derby at the lake near the marina. Contestants 
can fish anywhere on the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 The derby is a fund-raising benefit in memory of Imogene Vest, a longtime 
local Soroptimist member and avid angler who died of cancer four years ago, 
Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization awards a $1,000 scholarship each year to a graduating senior 
at Fillmore High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Children who enter will receive a packet of free fishing gear: hooks, sinker, 
bobber, bait and stringer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the morning, experienced anglers will show the kids how to cast, tie on 
hooks, and bait their line. 
</P>
<P>
 From 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., youths can test their abilities in a casting contest. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners will get a rod and reel. 
</P>
<P>
 The derby, which has grown for three consecutive years, drew nearly 200 
anglers last year, Hansen said. The end of the drought may have helped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fishing is a whole lot more fun when there is water in the lake," she said.

ON THE ROAD; A CALL TO REMEMBER THE FORGOTTEN SICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED, Leonard Reed is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Down the hall, past the shadowy room where the old woman's voice cries out for 
help, past the bright nurses' station, past the room with the stainless steel 
immersion tanks, Mildred waits. In bed. On her side, head propped on pillows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honey," she says to her visitor, "have you been to the thrift shop today? My! 
You ought to see what they've got." 
</P>
<P>
 She scoots up, her face gone from white to blush, her pale blue eyes suddenly 
filled with light, and she gestures across the room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm telling you, it's something down there," she insists, a Southern lilt 
dragging out the words like molasses. "Take a gooooood look." 
</P>
<P>
 In the visitor's chair is the prize: a used, poppy-yellow quilted housecoat 
from the nursing home store -- a Loungee, the label says, with fuzzy collar -- 
with the price tag still dangling: $5. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give me your hand," she says, reaching out and smiling, and then squeezes 
tight with both of her own strong hands. "Now, who are you?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Mary Health of the Sick Convalescent and Nursing Hospital has been here 
for 29 years. It's a different kind of nursing home in that all its clients are 
women -- not by edict but by habit. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19th Century Spanish order of nuns, Sister Servants of Mary, which has 121 
outposts worldwide as well as a convent in Oxnard, runs the place. As nuns go, 
they are a severe group in their dedication and mission. They exist solely to 
care for the forgotten sick. 
</P>
<P>
 In past generations, especially through Europe and Central America, nuns from 
Sister Servants of Mary would avoid clinics and hospitals, and travel to 
private homes to minister to the sick through the night. The nuns would return 
to their convent at daybreak and sleep during the day, only to rise again to 
permeate the night to dispense care and prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't keep our parents so much anymore. Today, the needful and dependent 
are often the elderly with no place to go. The sisters saw their client base 
shift and in need of centralized care. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence the immaculate facility here. The nonprofit nursing home is run with 
such efficiency and discipline -- white habits flow through gleaming hallways, 
followed by a humble paid staff of 48 -- that the nondenominational waiting 
list to get in is five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, just as the sisters knew that burdened families could use a lift, so, 
too, do the sisters receive a helping hand from volunteers. And one of the most 
popular of the volunteer efforts involves young boys who visit, deliver the 
day's newspaper and chat with residents about bargains in the thrift store or 
whatever else pops up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brothers Russ and Chris Trumpy, 15 and 12, respectively, are Thousand Oaks Boy 
Scouts. They started making visits here in an effort to meet the community 
service requirement for the Ad Altare Dei (At God's Altar) Medal. They've 
gotten to know some of the residents. But that doesn't exactly prepare them for 
every eventuality. 
</P>
<P>
 In the large, echoey recreation room, six women in wheelchairs sit before a TV 
that blares cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Help me, help me," says one, a regular on Russ' visit list. Russ takes her 
hand. "Help me! Help me!" 
</P>
<P>
 Russ suggests that she might like another channel. But a switch to "Oprah" 
won't do. She recommences her cry: "Help me!" 
</P>
<P>
 Russ suggests a ride through the hallway. The woman, a former schoolteacher in 
the grip of Alzheimer's disease, smiles as he whisks her away. 
</P>
<P>
 Russ' briefest visit is to the elegant woman who sits alone in her room and 
plays solitaire. She is legally blind, neatly coiffed and so poised as to 
appear tournament-ready. She breaks her concentration only to note, "My 
daughter gave me this book, '1,000 Ways to Play Solitaire.' Can you imagine?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mildred with the yellow housecoat might. As Russ and a visitor stopped by her 
room, it became plain how imagination and memory fills her time, creates the 
light in her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mildred, a horsewoman from Kentucky, will soon turn 98. For her 97th birthday, 
a volunteer with stables in Westlake had her over and brought a horse up close 
so that Mildred could feed it carrots. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Mildred's party still is taking shape. But meanwhile, she'll tell 
anybody who stops by not to pass through life without stopping in bluegrass 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Otherwise," she says, "you're truly missin' one good time."

CONDOS: PROJECT DEFEATED IN REDONDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kudos to Councilmen Joseph Dawidziak, Robert Pinzler and Stevan Colin for 
their courageous and intelligent votes against the Bidamar condo project at a 
recent public hearing. (Times, March 3) This vote will serve the city well for 
years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Kudos also go to Mayor Brad Parton. By allowing Bidamar to make a full 
75-minute presentation, the mayor made it virtually impossible for Bidamar to 
claim that they didn't get a fair and full hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Many thanks to all of the residents who put their time and money into 
defeating this project. You have much to be proud of. A special thanks for 
Delhia Vechi, the driving force behind this victory.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a big thank you goes out to District 2 Councilman Greg Hill. Hill's 
vote to add 163 new condos to his neighboring district should make it easier to 
replace him after one term.

ANIMALS: LEARNING TO LEARN FROM THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We are in danger of missing a great opportunity and an important lesson 
regarding the 58-pound female giant Pacific octopus at the Cabrillo Marine 
Aquarium (Around the South Bay, Feb. 24). Just as we were slow to learn that 
wolves aren't the bloodthirsty demons depicted in "Little Red Riding Hood," so 
other animals still suffer from our ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
 Friendly, gentle and intelligent beings, octopuses' brains are comparable to 
those of "higher" mammals. Octopuses are whizzes at solving puzzles, such as 
extracting food from jars by unscrewing the lids even when they have never seen 
such containers before. They also readily recognize people, form relationships, 
communicate in complicated ways we don't fully understand and enjoy collecting 
trinkets with which to decorate their cave homes.  
</P>
<P>
 In captivity, miserable octopuses eventually tear themselves to shreds in an 
exercise called "auto-mutilation syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
 How wonderful if our children were to be taught the importance of setting 
"Octavia" free! Or are our children to be shown that it is still acceptable to 
deny her the pleasures of her octopus life simply to liven up an exhibit?

DINING: USING COUPONS AT RESTAURANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I've been dining out in the South Bay, and using the Entertainment Card, 
several nights a week for the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to the state of the economy it's not unusual for a restaurant to close, or 
change ownership, before I use my coupon. But last week at "Le Petite Cafe" my 
Entertainment Card was refused because the owner "decided to cancel the 
contract" . . . a mere eight months before it expired. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose that in an era when .230 hitters demand renegotiation of 
multibillion-dollar contracts, I shouldn't be surprised, but I've gone to "Le 
Petite Cafe" for the last time. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment Card users beware!

COUNCIL: SVORINICH'S PERFORMANCE IN OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My letter concerns the less-than-stellar performance of the 15th District's 
Los Angeles City Council representative, Rudy Svorinich. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to the elected official's inability to take responsibility for his 
position, the entire district is suffering. His lack of experience, his lack of 
preparation, his surly and ill-chosen words regarding his predecessor and her 
accomplishments have cost the 15th District and its inhabitants dearly. 
</P>
<P>
 In regard to the homeless housing project in the San Pedro community, the 
councilman and his office staff were advised of the project during the first 
week of September, 1993. Attempts for meetings by city representatives were 
rebuffed. The councilman canceled two meetings with representatives and was 
advised that he needed to watch the project closely. He neglected to do so, and 
the rest, as they say, is history. 
</P>
<P>
 When he will be confronted with this by the vast number of irate homeowners, 
he will, of course, pass the "blame" (he does this all of the time) to: 
</P>
<P>
 1. His staff 
</P>
<P>
 2. The earthquake 
</P>
<P>
 3. Food poisoning 
</P>
<P>
 4. Tonya Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 Or he will deny this information altogether and denounce it as a "smear 
tactic." Considering the councilman's behavior thus far, bets can be made and 
paid that he will pass the buck on this latest antic, to be sure. 
</P>
<P>
 I originally voted for another candidate in the primary last year -- that 
person didn't make the cut, and I was faced with a choice between the incumbent 
and the present representative. I voted for Joan Milke Flores, recognizing that 
her experience and ability to further serve the district would far surpass 
Rudy's. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudy hadn't any legislative experience whatsoever; he hadn't been in the area 
for several years; he lacked maturity and seemed to vacillate on some very 
important issues during his campaign speeches. He also did not own property and 
therefore, his level of vested interest in the community was tenuous. In fact, 
he relied more on his family's ties with the community and less on his own 
during the campaign -- and the red flag was up for me. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of attention was paid to his ownership of Industrial Paints as a tie-in 
to the Harbor Area, but actually Rudy has spent a number of years in Sacramento 
as an aide to Assemblyman Gerald Felando.  
</P>
<P>
 Programs like the housing project have been set aside while Mr. Rudy Goes to 
Washington, chasing recognition for a project that will probably go through 
without his involvement. To give the reader an idea as to the level of respect 
Rudy commands with the Alameda Corridor Project Board, he couldn't even draw a 
second nomination to head the board during a meeting a while back. The silence 
when his name was nominated was deafening. 
</P>
<P>
 For the betterment of the district, it's time to remove the councilman and 
replace him with someone who knows what they're doing. His "learner's permit," 
as he so cutely refers to his tenure in office thus far, has expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, learner's permits are for high school students, and this isn't high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, is it?

WHALES: THE DANGERS OF MISTAKING THE SEASONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As to the person putting the captions on the pictures for your article on 
whales (March 24), "Exhibiting the Human Touch," they should have read the 
article first. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture on pages 13 and 14 is captioned, "A whale nuzzles up to a boat and 
the outstretched hands of humans.During mating season off Baja, whales enjoy 
the contact." During mating season you risk getting capsized (or getting hit by 
a 10-foot-long penis) if you are near the whales. It should have read, "During 
nursing season . . . " All the adult gray whale males have long since departed 
the lagoons for their migration north while the mothers nurse their young. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than the above, I congratulate your staff for an excellent article. 
</P>
<P>
 I kissed a whale.

FOR THE KIDS; LOCAL SHOW GIVES NEW SPIN TO 'ALADDIN'; STAGING BY WELL-KNOWN 
CHILDREN'S THEATER GROUP IS A CLEVER RENDITION OF THE FAMED TALE DONE IN THE 
CHINESE TRADITION.

 If you take your family to see the stage production of "Aladdin," don't expect 
the Disney version with a genie who hams it up as hysterically as Robin 
Williams does in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, this performance, coming to Ventura on Friday night, is the Chinese 
version of the famous story from "The Arabian Nights." It's staged in 
traditional Chinese theater style. 
</P>
<P>
 It's still a musical, although you won't recognize any of the tunes. None of 
them is from the Disney movie. And it's still funny. 
</P>
<P>
 "The genie is pretty much a character," said Thomas Siniscalco, producer of 
the show, performed by the Prince Street Players, a theater group based in 
Readington, N. J. "He's not as funny as Robin Williams, but he's close." 
</P>
<P>
 The show, on the road since October, will be presented at 7 p.m. at Buena High 
School's auditorium, 5670 Telegraph Road. Reserve tickets are $10 for kids, $12 
for adults, $1 more at the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, for a little background. The story "Aladdin" is one of many told by the 
young woman Scheherazade to the sultan in the city of Baghdad around 850 B. C., 
according to the theater group. Because the difficult sultan had threatened to 
kill her if she didn't entertain him, she told him a tale each night. The 
collection of stories came to be known as "A Thousand and One Nights." 
</P>
<P>
 The author of the stories isn't known. They were written in Arabic, but the 
stories are set in Asia, India and China. This rendition of "Aladdin" takes 
place in China and is more in keeping with the original, Siniscalco said, than 
the movie, which was set in Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stage show, the boy Aladdin is poor, yet he's a free spirit who does 
little to support himself and his widowed mother, despite criticism from 
others. One day, he is flying his kite and a gust of wind carries him over a 
wall into the emperor's garden. There, he meets the beautiful princess. 
</P>
<P>
 The two are smitten with each other, but the princess is under an ultimatum to 
marry the richest man in China. Now Aladdin longs to be rich. Enter a magician 
who leads the boy to a cave and a special lamp harboring the genie who helps 
him in his quest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese theater style used for the production is unusual. (Thornton 
Wilder's "Our Town" comes close to it.) The sets are simple, using such objects 
as ladders, sawhorses or chairs to represent other things. An onstage narrator 
talks to the audience and even plays several parts, including a tree. The 
actors themselves prepare the set for each scene, then become characters in the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Audience members must use their imaginations. A 16-foot rolling ladder, draped 
in material, becomes at various times a mountain, throne or the entrance to a 
cave. Giant panels of rippling blue silk become clouds as the genie flies 
Aladdin. Some scenery is traditional, and the costumes are colorfully 
embroidered. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, the cast, numbering 10, asks the audience to participate in the 
drama by answering yes or no questions or by thinking of something. The show, 
presented by the Ventura Children's Festival, lasts about one hour and is 
recommended for elementary-age kids and older. 
</P>
<P>
 The Prince Street Players have been around since 1965, having performed 
children's productions on Broadway, at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles and 
even a run last year in Japan with their rendition of "The Emperor's New 
Clothes." Details

FASHION; METALLIC OFFERS A DASH OF FLASH; NATURAL AND NEUTRAL ARE GIVING WAY TO 
THE GILDED LOOK -- FROM LARGE, SHINY PURSES TO DAZZLING TENNIS SHOES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It seems like only yesterday that a back-to-nature focus hit the fashion 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Tones went neutral, lines flowed softly; cotton and linen took command. Hues 
of brown, buff and sage were everywhere, sending an organic message. Earth 
consciousness was in. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, the backlash. Forest-forward clothing has reaped its own demise. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the newest thing in fashion is . . . get ready . . . METALLIC! 
</P>
<P>
 You could call it the industrial revolution, but somebody already took that 
name. So, how about the organic mutiny? 
</P>
<P>
 It's serious stuff. At the Academy Awards, choreographer Debbie Allen showed 
up for the ceremony in a genuine brass breastplate. If this trend continues, 
women could be in full armor before the year is out. Which would mean that 
someone would have to follow them around and help them in and out of 
automobiles -- just what women have been trying to avoid for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 It's one of those things that creeps up on you. And in Ventura County, the 
signs are already here. Lurex is back, along with sequins and super-shiny shoes 
and handbags that should go far to prevent pedestrian traffic fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike past metallic waves, this one is bringing styles meant to shine in the 
sun. There are hordes of bright straw hats in all-over gold, along with others 
sporting gold bows, bands and trims. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold handbags, too, are not wimpy little evening clutches. They're big 
workaday totes in shiny leather or playful blends of leather and sequins. 
Besides stopping traffic, these numbers could go a long way toward daunting 
purse snatchers. With one of them under his arm, a thief would stand out like a 
moose on snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Most gold-trimmed dresses, meanwhile, seem to be for formal wear. But Lurex 
tops are shown for daytime. And obviously ready for the sun are iridescent 
swimsuits. There are half a dozen suits with bold gold patterns on a black 
background at Bullock's, Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 And to get fully into the metallic mood, women can indulge in shimmery makeup. 
Revlon, for one, makes a product designed to make skin sparkle with golden 
highlights. Not to worry; the shiny stuff is iron oxide and mica. 
</P>
<P>
 Lips can match. Iridescent lipstick, including some in gold tones, is 
available in many lines. 
</P>
<P>
 But the award for the most common gilded item in the marketplace goes to 
shoes. And there are no holds barred on styles. We found pumps, sandals, 
loafers, tennis shoes and even brightly gilded clogs ready to dance down the 
highway of life. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sears in the Esplanade, we asked salesclerk Robert Gutierrez how women were 
taking to the flashy footwear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Metallics are going to be a strong thing," he said, "They do sell well." 
</P>
<P>
 A popular destination for shiny shoes is Las Vegas, according to Gutierrez. "A 
lot of women associate metallics with gambling," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So do some merchants. Georgia Boutell, owner of Georgia Boutell's Art Deco in 
Ventura, said she is investing sparingly in metallic clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all going to end up on the sale racks," she said. "I like more classic 
things that will last longer." 
</P>
<P>
 At Oak Tree in Oxnard, manager Leah Wylie agreed. "It will stay three months. 
People will go right back to natural," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, we think that they're missing the clues. You'll recall that the 
same thing happened with Spam. At first, people tried to laugh it off. A 
generation later, it has nearly covered the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 Just remember, when you see the outfits -- complete with chain mail -- you 
read about it here.

PEOPLE: VOICE OF REASON FOLLOWS VOCAL TRIUMPH 
</P>

 After judges at the Los Angeles Music Center named Laura Griffith one of the 
most talented young amateur opera singers in Southern California last week, the 
Rolling Hills teen-ager was first astonished, then sensible. "It's a really 
good thing to put on your resume," she said. Griffith, 18, knows a little bit 
about resume-building. She's been doing it since second grade, after she 
auditioned for summer stock at a Palos Verdes community theater and played 
Dorothy in "The Wizard of Oz." Since then, she has had dozens of leading roles 
in amateur productions and spent two summers at the prestigious Interlochen 
Music Camp in Michigan.  
</P>
<P>
 It paid off. On March 29, Griffith won the Los Angeles Music Center's annual 
Spotlight Award in opera, which includes a $5,000 scholarship. The performance 
was the culmination of a months-long audition process involving hundreds of 
Southern California's most artistically talented teen-agers. Griffith, one of 
two students competing in the finals, performed "The Laughing Song" from 
Strauss' "Die Fledermaus" before an audience of 3,200. 
</P>
<P>
 Until two years ago, Griffith knew very little about opera, she said. "When 
you're little, you think of opera as big fat women singing with horns on their 
head. I didn't want that," she said, laughing. "I wanted to tap-dance and belt 
out songs on Broadway."  
</P>
<P>
 She attended the Chadwick School, a private school on the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula where she is now a senior, and spent two summers at the Michigan 
camp, where an instructor suggested that she had a "voice really suited to 
opera," Griffith said.  
</P>
<P>
 At first, she was reluctant to try it. "I hadn't listened to or seen opera. My 
parents weren't into it. I had worked on maybe one aria, a Mozart piece from 
the 'Marriage of Figaro.' I wanted to sing from the soul, and I thought the 
details of opera -- it demands so much and it's so precise -- would constrain 
me."  
</P>
<P>
 She was wrong. "I learned I can sing from my soul just as well in opera," she 
said. And she proved it at the Music Center awards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning has been incredible for me," she said. "I don't think of myself as a 
competitive person. I focus on my own strengths and weaknesses. If I get a part 
or don't get a part, it's because I was right or wrong for that part. It's not 
because I was better than someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents, both music-lovers, introduced Griffith to music early. She 
started piano lessons in second grade and joined her parents on excursions to 
the Long Beach Civic Light Opera several times a year. Her father, who is in 
the banking business, used to play classical music games in the car. "He'd play 
a song and ask me who the composer was," she said. "I'd always say Beethoven, 
because I thought everything was Beethoven."  
</P>
<P>
 Her father's love for music had a great impact on her, she said. "He has very 
eclectic taste. Some of it I love, but some of it I can't listen to. Like the 
German oom-pah-pah. And he likes Julio Iglesias," she said, apologizing for the 
potential embarrassment this public disclosure might cause her father.  
</P>
<P>
 Griffith also likes rock music, but because the family doesn't subscribe to 
cable television, she never watches MTV. "I don't collect a lot of rock CDs," 
she said. "I collect opera CDs. I'd put on 'La Traviata' instead of Pearl Jam." 
 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating in June, Griffith will attend the Aspen Music School in 
Colorado for nine weeks on full scholarship from the Music Center. In the fall, 
she starts at the University of Michigan, where she plans to major in voice. 
After that? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know, that's a hard one," she said. "It's scary following a career in 
the performing arts. There's no right path. If you look at the major stars, 
everyone has done it in different ways. The nice thing about opera, there's no 
rush to become a star. There's no rule that you have to be young. That means 
you can spend a lot of time just working at it."  
</P>

THEATER REVIEW; A COMEDY WITHOUT A TRACE OF CYNICISM; 'THE MATCHMAKER' TELLS 
THE WHIMSICAL STORY OF A POMPOUS, TYRANNICAL MERCHANT WHO ENLISTS HELP IN 
FINDING A WIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When was the last time that you heard someone say, "Isn't the world full of 
wonderful things?" -- and mean it? 
</P>
<P>
 For that kind of honest enthusiasm, we have to look back to that 
quintessential optimist -- Thornton Wilder -- and his expansive embrace of 
human possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, in a time when humor has become practically synonymous with 
corrosive acid, capturing Wilder's large-hearted comic spirit without seeming 
hopelessly corny in the process is a tough challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's exactly what PCPA Theaterfest have done with its revival of 
Wilder's "The Matchmaker," a classic comedy that delights without a trace of 
cynicism. 
</P>
<P>
 More plot-driven than Wilder's episodic perennial "Our Town," "The Matchmaker" 
was adapted from a 19th-Century German farce by Johann Nestroy. (Wilder's play, 
in turn, later became the source for the musical "Hello, Dolly.") 
</P>
<P>
 Set around the turn of the century, the whimsical story centers around a 
pompous, tyrannical merchant named Vandergelder (Paul Klein) from Yonkers, N. 
Y., who enlists the help of matchmaker Dolly Levi (Kitty Balay) to find a wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Vandergelder's approach to romance isn't much different from filling a clerk's 
position at his store -- he has a clearly defined set of responsibilities and 
expectations in mind, regardless of the person who ultimately gets the job. 
</P>
<P>
 What he has to learn -- through Dolly's sly manipulation -- is that the true 
role of a spouse is to point the way to the hidden places in his own heart. 
</P>
<P>
 While pretending to set him up with various eligible candidates, Dolly 
gradually brings Vandergelder around to this recognition, and the ultimate 
conclusion that she herself is the one who can best help him. 
</P>
<P>
 But -- and this is where we most appreciate Wilder's sophisticated realism -- 
Dolly has no starry-eyed illusions about the relationship. She knows that 
Vandergelder will always be a surly fool, but less a fool under her influence. 
And she can also help him spread some of his wealth where it will do some good 
for others as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the complications are a pair of subplots -- one concerning the love 
between Vandergelder's niece (Britta K. Swearingen) and the poor artist (Garlyn 
Punao) that Vandergelder has forbidden her to marry, and the other involving 
two of his clerks (Jeremy Johnson and Patrick Crawford) who risk their jobs for 
a grand adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 The stories converge in a hilarious tangle when Vandergelder, in search of a 
bride, goes to New York and the others follow suit. Naturally, an entire city 
isn't big enough to keep them from meeting up at the most inopportune times. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to hide from the dismissal they know will occur if Vandergelder lays 
eyes on them, the clerks manage to ruin their boss's prospects with a widowed 
shopkeeper (Lisa Paulsen). But they atone by taking her and her ditsy assistant 
(Tarah Flanagan) to dinner -- in the same restaurant in which the boss will be 
dining, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Roger DeLaurier has not only drawn unfailingly funny and engaging 
performances from the entire cast (Paulsen, Balay and Johnson, in particular), 
he's staged the piece with enough rapid-fire slapstick to keep us laughing as 
much at what the characters do as at what they say. 
</P>
<P>
 The physical comedy ranges in intensity from pure manic frenzy -- like the 
scene in which the clerks dive into closets and under tables to keep from being 
discovered -- to more subtle touches, such as when Dolly protests that she 
could never marry Vandergelder (not that he's asked her to, yet) and tells him, 
"You go your way" (pointing in one direction) "and I'll go mine" (pointing in 
the same direction). 
</P>
<P>
 Picture Wilder's warm-toned humanism performed by the Marx brothers, and 
you've got the general idea. Details

CENTERPIECE: AFTER THE FIRES; NATURE: LAST YEAR'S BLAZES IN VENTURA COUNTY 
DESTROYED BUSHY CHAPARRAL. THE RESULT IS A BUMPER CROP OF WILDFLOWERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a bright side to the fires that charred the Santa Monica Mountains 
late last year: A bumper crop of wildflowers is blooming there this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, wildflowers are blooming all over Ventura County. This is the season 
to traipse through the hills and spot patches of brilliant orange California 
poppies or splashes of blue-purple lupines. 
</P>
<P>
 But you are in for a wildflower high if you hike the trails of the Santa 
Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. Blooming in the Rancho Sierra Vista 
area in Newbury Park are 79 varieties of wildflowers, according to a list 
prepared by National Park Service rangers. And the Circle X Ranch, near the 
coastal border of Ventura and Los Angeles counties, is another blooming bonanza 
with 55 species. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot more flowers than usual," said Ray Sauvajot, an ecologist 
with the park service. What's more, they are likely to be abundant for the next 
few years. 
</P>
<P>
 In burned areas, the fire destroyed the bushy chaparral, which normally beats 
out the wildflowers in the competition for water, sun and soil nutrients, 
Sauvajot said. Without the chaparral, the wildflowers have a better chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can make a dramatic resurgence," he said. That is, until the chaparral 
grows back and resumes its dominant role. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's crop began blooming in March, and the colorful show will continue 
through April and into May. So, what will you see if you hit the trails? 
</P>
<P>
 Most anywhere you go in the burned areas of the Santa Monica Mountains, you'll 
see colorful phacelias, lupines and blue dicks. The white blooms of the wild 
cucumber with its inedible, spiny pods are plentiful, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Chances are good that you might stumble across the rare chocolate lily. The 
brown-colored lily, absent for several years, is making a surprise appearance 
this year, most likely because of the fires. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not common at all," park Ranger Mark Boehler said. "We don't see it very 
often, but it's coming up in quite a few places." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly, the Humboldt lily will be blooming in upper Sycamore Canyon, which 
stretches from Rancho Sierra Vista to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be spectacular," Boehler said. "I've never seen so many of them 
there in my life." They have bright yellow-orange flowers with red spots, and 
grow more than five feet tall, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One species less plentiful this year is the giant coreopsis, a small tree-like 
plant with a woody stem and yellow daisy-like flowers. The fires wiped out many 
of these perennials, and it will take a while for them to bounce back. Those 
that are blooming were missed by the flames. A good place to see them is along 
Pacific Coast Highway south of Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's poppies you want, there are smatterings of them throughout the 
mountains. They're a sure bet at Rancho Sierra Vista and Point Mugu State Park. 
But one of the best poppy-viewing locations is at Leo Carrillo State Park on 
the coast, just over the Los Angeles County line. On the Nicholas Flat trail, 
whole hillsides of them are in bloom, giving off a golden glow. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't want to work hard to see masses of wildflowers, head for Rancho 
Sierra Vista, especially the easy trails that loop around the grassy fields 
near the Satwiwa Native American Indian Culture Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are huge stands of wild radish in bloom," Boehler said. These white, 
yellow or purple flowers stand five feet tall. Also blooming are poppies, 
phacelias and lupine. "Whole sections are covered with it." 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't mind a strenuous hike, try La Jolla Canyon Trail in Point Mugu 
State Park. 
</P>
<P>
 As you enter the canyon on a fire road, you'll see patches of lupines, blue 
dicks and an occasional Mariposa lily. As the trail goes through a narrow gorge 
with a waterfall, giant coreopsis sprout from the rocky mountainside. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering the wide-open La Jolla Valley, keep your eyes open for poppies, wild 
cucumber, orange-red paint brush, white morning glories and varieties of 
ceanothus. 
</P>
<P>
 (Resist the temptation to pick them. It's illegal and, if you get caught, you 
could face a fine.) 
</P>
<P>
 While hiking the trails in the Santa Monica Mountains, you might see some 
fields ablaze with color, but more often the effect is subtle -- patches of 
flowers here and there, splashes that you might miss if you weren't watching 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the joy of discovery -- happening upon these things, instead of having 
them in your face," Ranger Jaquie Stiver said. "That makes it more special." 
Flowering Trails 
</P>
<P>
 If the arrival of spring puts you in the mood to tiptoe among the wildflowers, 
the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, as well as other areas in 
and around Ventura County, offer a variety of viewing spots: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Leo Carrillo State Beach: Located just below the Los Angeles County border 
along the coast. Take Pacific Coast Highway south, just past Mulholland 
Highway. What to look for: poppies (take Nicholas Flat trail a mile or so). 
</P>
<P>
 2) Circle X Ranch: Near the coastal border of Ventura and Los Angeles 
counties. Take Pacific Coast Highway south; take Yerba Buena Road about five 
miles to the park site. Suggested hike is on the Mishe Mokwa Trail, continuing 
on to Sandstone Peak, about six miles total. What to look for: phacelias, 
shooting stars, blue dicks, miners lettuce, popcorn flower, chocolate lily. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Rancho Sierra Vista / Satwiwa: Take the Wendy Drive exit off the Ventura 
Freeway, go south and then west on Potrero Road. Take the 1.5-mile Satwiwa Loop 
Trail starting at the Satwiwa Native American Indian Culture Center. What to 
look for: poppies, wild radish, phacelias, lupine. 
</P>
<P>
 4) Wildwood Park / Thousand Oaks: Take the Lynn Road exit off the Ventura 
Freeway and go north. Go west on Avenida de los Arboles to Big Sky Drive. What 
to look for: the rare chocolate lily, shooting stars, phacelia, wild morning 
glory, purple nightshade, wild cucumber, miners lettuce. 
</P>
<P>
 5) Los Padres National Forest / Ojai: Wildflowers are blooming at lower 
elevations. What to look for: California poppies, lupine, popcorn flower, wild 
hyacinth, baby blue eyes and the Mariposa lily. Gridley and Horn Canyon trails 
near Ojai and Santa Paula Canyon are recommended.

EARTHWATCH: VENTURA COUNTY FIRMS TO STRUT THEIR STUFF AT L.A.'S ECO EXPO; 
BUSINESSES REPRESENTED AT THE EVENT RANGE FROM THOSE THAT PROMOTE CLEAN AIR AND 
WATER TO FASHION CONCERNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 High fashion, high-tech, high performance and, best of all, high environmental 
quality are what you're going to find if you check out this year's Ventura 
County contingent to ECO EXPO. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Ventura County-based businesses, which specialize in environmentally 
preferred products and services, will be strutting their stuff at the Los 
Angeles Convention Center beginning today. The fourth annual ECO EXPO being 
held there all day Saturday and Sunday will be preceded today and Friday by a 
special Green Business Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 All this is dedicated to the idea that environmentalism can be a healthy thing 
for businesses as well as consumers -- not a regulatory burden or a hair shirt, 
as it's been portrayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington is dispatching Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary and U. S. Sen. 
Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) to show the flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's our county's eco-team: 
</P>
<P>
 You've probably heard of high fashion items made from organic fibers such as 
cotton, hemp and wool. 
</P>
<P>
 But how about "wearable art," as Thousand Oaks designer Lindsay Jackson calls 
it, made from vintage -- that means recycled -- drapery fabric? 
</P>
<P>
 "Beautiful drapery material is easy to wash to a body-soft touch," she said 
when I queried her about the kind of outfit a desperate Scarlett O'Hara made 
from the drapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who claims never to have seen "Gone With the Wind," makes altogether 
modern gear such as flowing palazzo pants, fringed skirts and tank tops out of 
bolt ends, thrift store and estate-sale acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 As reported in a prior Earthwatch, cloth makes up a surprisingly large 
percentage of what we annually send to the landfill, so it's nice to see it 
intercepted and put to another purpose so stylishly. You can see examples 
year-round at Maggie & Me, a boutique in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 And while we're dealing with unusual juxtapositions, how about the case of the 
man nicknamed "Smoke" who wants to help clean up the county's smog by selling 
clean-air trucks? the commercial sales manager for Todey Chevrolet in Oxnard, 
Kenneth M. (Smoke) Smokoska, has been advertising an ECO TRUCK in the local 
agricultural trade press. 
</P>
<P>
 Todey Chevrolet has been designated an accredited natural gas service 
location, and Smokoska is determined to put as many clean-burning natural gas 
work trucks on local farms as he can. As I never tire of pointing out -- and 
Smoke certainly tells prospective clients -- these truck engines run two, even 
three times longer than an ordinary engine without needing an overhaul and 
whack 30% off an owner's fuel bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Now from clean air to clean water, with the help of two local firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Enviro-Reps International Inc. uses a range of products involving living 
organisms instead of chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 The company calls this "advanced enzyme technologies." Owner Bob Friedman told 
me that "every lake in the world has problems with unwanted algae growth (and) 
everybody with the problem finds us." 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of his customers are commercial fish farmers in Asia, he 
recently came to the rescue of the Bratkoskis', a Santa Paula family with a 
50,000-gallon decorative koi pond. "We couldn't see the fish and the underwater 
plants were dying," Bill Bratkoski said. 
</P>
<P>
 A week after Friedman began his nontoxic enzyme treatment, the flora and fauna 
were completely visible. The fish are breeding now, according to the 
Bratkoskis, who bent my ear with praise for Friedman's enzymes. 
</P>
<P>
 In cases of pools, which are mostly used by humans, the problem is chlorine. 
Bad stuff, according to declarations last month from the Environmental 
Protection Agency in Washington -- probably destined for banning from many 
popular products and applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, Tim Gayvert of EPIC Services in Moorpark is ahead of the curve. For 
several years, he has been installing drinking water and pool water 
conditioning systems -- principally involving filtration and reverse-osmosis 
technology, which leaves the water 95% chlorine-free, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Two local educational-services companies will be represented at ECO EXPO. 
Midway Productions has produced a line of environmentally themed videos. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentally themed children's theater productions are staged by Through 
Children's Eyes Inc., which will be bringing its star performer, Tammy the 
Recycling Eagle, to the Convention Center this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 She is fresh from her tour of several Ventura County schools as the lead in 
"The Mystery of the Missing Trees." A must-see, like the rest of ECO EXPO this 
year. Details

TIDBITS; SPUDS: YOGURT SHOP ADDS NEW MACHINES, ONE TO GRIND UP SOME CREATIVE 
CONCOCTIONS MADE OF BAKED POTATOES. 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura's Cafe Yogurt & More just added some more more. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, owner Cheri Burk unveiled two identical machines, one to produce an 
array of baked potatoes, the other to spit out a multitude of soft-serve yogurt 
and ice-cream flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 The spud machine will allow her to create made-to-order potatoes by mixing 
potato meat and other ingredients in the machine. She will pop the final 
product into the microwave to warm and serve either on a potato skin or in a 
cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Burk is now busy dreaming up combinations -- maybe one with Caesar dressing, 
cheese, and butter, she said, or another with turkey and gravy. "You can create 
whatever you want," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the yogurt: "We put chocolate or vanilla nonfat yogurt into the 
machine. Then people can choose from all kinds of toppings -- Heath bar crunch, 
chocolate chip cookie dough," Burk said. And combinations, like 
strawberry-banana, can be made by mixing the fruits with the yogurt. The same 
technique is used for the ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 The cafe is in the Target shopping center at 4020 E. Main St. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Fiducia and Scott Hinton are attracting novice coffee drinkers to their 
2-month-old Simi Valley coffeehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people coming in have never had a cappuccino," said Fiducia, an 
experienced coffee guzzler who co-owns the Coffee Connection. "Some have never 
seen a whole bean." 
</P>
<P>
 The entrepreneurs have seen plenty of beans in their time, but they only 
recently learned about what goes into roasting and brewing them. "We had to 
research coffees and machines," said Fiducia who, like Hinton, used to manage a 
finance company. "We spent a lot of time reading books about coffee and about 
what espresso really is." 
</P>
<P>
 Coffee Connection offers 26 roasts and flavors daily, with selections changing 
periodically. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the establishment also sells some pastries, but the owners are 
looking for a refrigerator large enough to accommodate perishable desserts and 
sandwiches. Coffee Connection is at 1407-X E. Los Angeles Ave., in the HomeBase 
shopping center.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; THIS PASTRAMI SPICES UP LOCAL FARE; MARION'S IN VENTURA 
SERVES A GIANT, JUICY VERSION OF THE CLASSIC FOR $5.95. THE MENU IS FAIRLY 
LIMITED BUT THE REUBEN SHOWS POTENTIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Downtown Ventura is an unlikely place to run into a good pastrami sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
 This spiced-meat portion of the American culinary legend comes to us via 
Eastern Europe, actually southeastern Europe, since Romania is rumored to be 
its point of origin. 
</P>
<P>
 The beef brisket was doused with pickling spices for preservation back in the 
days before refrigeration. That spicing has continued and even crossed 
continents and oceans. Today, the United States is full of delis, joints -- 
even real restaurants -- where one goes just for the pastrami. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, it's Langer's on Alvarado Street, or maybe even Nate & Al's in 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's difficult to even consider pastrami in New York without envisioning 
the Carnegie Delicatessen (but definitely not the delicatessen of the same name 
in Beverly Hills) or, perhaps, the Stage Deli. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in Ventura -- on a Thompson Boulevard corner nestled alongside the 
freeway, in a location where Mexican food was dished up for at least the last 
couple of decades -- can be found a good hot pastrami sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
 Marion's Pastrami Express is serving a giant, juicy pastrami sandwich for 
$5.95 that will get even better when the Express realizes that it needs better 
rolls than those now being used. 
</P>
<P>
 The meat is so tender -- from its exceptionally thin slicing, they say -- that 
it sort of falls apart inside your mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 They serve a ton of it and, although the beef is lean, there's just enough fat 
to make it interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 Although its menu is very limited, Marion's does boast a few other items 
besides the pastrami. The hot dog ($1.75) is fairly good, the hamburger ($2.45) 
is all right, and the side orders are passable, the unfortunate exception being 
cole slaw, which is horribly overdosed in mayonnaise. 
</P>
<P>
 The seasoned fries ($1.50) with Lawry's seasoned salt, have great flavor, but 
the potatoes themselves are mushier than they should be. 
</P>
<P>
 A Reuben sandwich ($5.39) does show potential. It's got the basic savory, 
spicy pastrami, the required thousand island dressing and sauerkraut. The rye 
bread can use some lessons from one of those places like Langer's or the Stage. 
Let's get to it, guys. 
</P>
<P>
 What else would you possibly drink with a hot pastrami sandwich except beer? 
(Well, perhaps a Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray tonic or creme soda, which you will not 
find here.) I'd go for the Mickey's Malt Liquor on tap ($1.25), although there 
is also Miller Lite and Budweiser ($1.25 cup). 
</P>
<P>
 Pastrami lovers know all too well that there is more than just meat and bread 
to a real pastrami sandwich. In fact, there are those who insist that it isn't 
a pastrami sandwich if it doesn't have Gulden's mustard. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Marion's has this and several other mustards on the counter, but the one 
I enjoy -- please don't lynch me, you traditionalists -- is the Beaver sweet 
hot variety, which has a dollop of honey in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Marion's itself is mostly patio. The furniture is bright orange picnic tables 
under Pepsi and Heineken umbrellas, with a lone pink plastic flamingo surveying 
the scene from the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty basic, but then they won't be lining up for the decor; it's the 
pastrami that will be pulling them in. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Marion's Pastrami Express. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: 204 E. Thompson Blvd., Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Open seven days, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: Lunch or dinner for two, food only, $6 to $13.50. 
</P>

WANNA DANCE: AT THIS CLUB, THE MOTION CARRIES ALONG WITH GOOD, CLEAN FUN FOR 
THE FOOTLOOSE AND THE FANCY FEET

 It's a place for neophyte hoofers to discover their inner dancer. A place for 
recovering ballerinas to spit in Fokine's face. A place for line dancers to 
step out of line. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, dance fiends, DanceWorks is ready to begin in Laguna Beach, and its 
organizers want you, professional or tyro, to abandon inhibition and feel the 
music, a la the legendary bare-footed doyenne of interpretive dance, Isadora 
Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a way to reach in and find the dancer inherent in us all," said Alison 
Brown, one of three Laguna Beach residents staging the dances, which will be 
held every other Friday, starting April 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are plenty of people out there looking for this kind of thing," Brown 
said. "I call them closet dancers, turned off by the smoke and alcohol and mind 
games you find in bars." 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking and alcohol are indeed banned at the 8 p.m.-to-midnight, 
city-sponsored affair at the Laguna Beach Recreation Center. Dancers of all 
ages and degrees of expertise -- including none -- are welcome. For $5, 
participants can hear recorded music ranging from hip-hop to classical, world 
beat to techno, jazz to reggae. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the first official DanceWorks is still a day away, a recent kickoff 
party brought a couple dozen men and women and a few children to the rec 
center, which boasts a spacious 11,000-square-foot floor and high ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Clad in leotards and tights, shorts or loose-fitting shifts and skirts, sweaty 
dancers twirled, hopped and undulated expressively in the dimly lit room, 
improvising every move to strong, propulsive rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
 Some wore shoes; many didn't. Some danced solo, some in pairs, mirroring each 
other's actions by suddenly dropping to the floor and rolling about or swaying 
arms and torsos like trees blowing in the breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Participant Rebecca, who preferred to give only her first name, said similar 
opportunities for "do whatever you want" dance have been offered around the 
country for years. A former ballet dancer who trained at such leading schools 
as those affiliated with American Ballet Theatre and the Joffrey Ballet, she 
said she enjoys the "non-elitist" atmosphere here. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a way for people to express their creativity," the Orange resident 
said, "and I feel that creativity should be a part of everyday life." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Schriner, minister at Unitarian Fellowship of Laguna Beach, said he has 
been attending such dances for about 20 of his 51 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to have a movement situation where you can express your feelings 
with a minimum of (technical) structure," he said between songs. "I tend to 
work a lot with my mind, and this allows me to put thinking aside and get back 
into my body." 
</P>
<P>
 The event's three organizers -- Brown (a massage therapist), Vandano (a 
general contractor) and Felix Therin (a painter and stone carver) -- recently 
discussed DanceWorks' genesis. 
</P>
<P>
 Sipping cappuccino in a sun-drenched Laguna coffeehouse patio, they said the 
event is emerging phoenix-like from the ashes of Danceasy, which Therin, 53, 
began staging about 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicknamed "Mr. Dance," he launched the affairs in a large artists studio he 
called "The Big Box," where plays, performance art and mime were also staged, 
mostly for neighborhood friends in search of live, alternative entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were desperate for that kind of thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, however, Therin had to move Danceasy to a second Laguna location 
(the studio was not zoned for entertainment), and then, for various other 
reasons, a third and fourth, until, burned out, he called it quits in December. 
</P>
<P>
 But by that time, Vandano, 38, had been attending Danceasy regularly for five 
years, and Brown, 40, for one year. Neither wanted to see its demise, so they 
picked up the torch, enlisting Therin's help. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of few satisfactions in life is to create something and pass it on," 
Therin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vandano, who will be a deejay for DanceWorks, said he will play an eclectic 
mix of such bands and artists as U2, UB40, Enigma, Ace of Base, Vinx, Madonna, 
Eric Clapton and King Sunny Ade, many of whom he rarely hears at dance clubs he 
frequents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been music that I've wanted to dance to, but never had the chance or 
place," said the neatly bearded conga drummer who uses the single Hindi name he 
assumed when first practicing East Indian meditation in the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, DanceWorks organizers hope to offer live music, such as a drumming jam 
by Vandano and cronies. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who studied ballet for years as a teen before branching into various 
ethnic dance styles, said she will lead an 8-to-9 p.m. warm-up or "guided 
movement expression." This teaches dancers to "trust their impulses toward 
creativity" and direct their energy inward. 
</P>
<P>
 Explaining that most of us move through life in a robotic, linear fashion 
(standing, walking, sitting with spines rigidly erect), she closed her eyes and 
spoke of reaching deeper and deeper inside to live from "within-without, rather 
than without-within." 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as we can, like children, explore and open up physically, we find new 
ways of relating to each other," she said. "That's what we're trying to 
encourage. This will be an unconditionally accepting environment." 
</P>
<P>
 They expect that, at first, most attendees will come from the immediate area, 
but they hope to expand that boundary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want it to be a place for people of like souls to come together," Brown 
said.

RODEO ACTIVE; MAINSTREAM SUCCESS HASN'T CORRALLED CHRIS LEDOUX AWAY FROM HIS 
LOVE FOR THE COWBOY WAY OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Richard Cromelin is a free-lance 
writer who regularly writes about pop music for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 In Garth Brooks' first hit single, 1989's "Much Too Young (to Feel This Damn 
Old)," the singer is an aging rodeo rider at the wheel of his truck. He can't 
stop to sleep if he wants to make his ride in Denver the next night, there's 
been no answer at home for two weeks (but he's surprised that she stuck around 
as long as she did), and the competition is getting younger and the broncs 
tougher. Then he lists his few comforts: 
</P>
<P>
 A worn-out tape of Chris LeDoux, lonely women and bad booze  
</P>
<P>
 Seem to be the only friends I've left at all  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was a fateful couplet. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks has generously said that his mention of LeDoux helped his career by 
giving him credibility with a hard-core audience, but it really turned things 
around for LeDoux, boosting him out of cultdom and putting him in the 
mainstream of country music. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years later, LeDoux was a label-mate of Brooks at Liberty Records, and 
he would have his own country hit -- a duet with Brooks called "Whatcha Gonna 
Do With a Cowboy." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that LeDoux had been hurting, exactly. He still hadn't paid off his 
500-acre ranch in Wyoming, but every year he recorded a self-financed album, 
and every year it would go into the distribution pipeline to Western 
merchandise stores. His fans knew where to go to find his latest set of songs 
celebrating rural traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 LeDoux started this cycle in 1972, when he was a professional rodeo bareback 
rider. He recorded 11 songs in a basement studio in Sheridan, Wyo., with a 
local highway patrolman on bass and a rancher on guitar, and started selling 
copies at rodeos out of the back of his truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Then his mom and dad got involved. They bought the equipment to turn out 
eight-track cartridges at their Nashville-area home, gluing the labels on by 
hand. His father, Al, wrote mail-order ads in the form of stories about the 
West, and placed them in such magazines as Rodeo Sports News, Hoof and Horns, 
Rodeo News and Western Horseman. 
</P>
<P>
 They sold $6,100 worth of his debut, "Songs of the Rodeo Life." The second 
album brought in $13,000, then sales jumped to $32,000 for the third. Along the 
way, distributors came calling, and all from the fifth album on sold more than 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, they have credibility," LeDoux says of those early albums now. He has 
mixed feelings about the reissue of all 22 of them on CD, part of his Liberty 
Records deal, but he can live with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say somethin' that I wanted to say at the time, but I can't really 
listen to 'em." he said. "I wasn't a singer back then. I rode buckin' horses 
for a livin', and I wrote a few songs. I never was a performer. What they said 
was exactly what I had in mind for the time. . . . They were ragged, but they 
were real." 
</P>
<P>
 LeDoux's audiences are bigger now that he has records on the charts than when 
he was a bona fide cult hero, and the subject matter isn't always so specific. 
But the young guys in Wranglers and Stetsons are still there at the core, 
singing along loudly with LeDoux's flavorful accounts of life in the rodeo 
trenches and on the ranches. 
</P>
<P>
 When LeDoux -- who plays two sold-out shows at the Crazy Horse in Santa Ana on 
Monday and returns there in June -- cranks up the amps and gives his music rock 
dynamics, his show takes on a celebratory edge that makes it more than 
entertainment. It's a resounding affirmation of a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, there's a lot of cowboys and cowgirls out there," LeDoux said by 
phone during a tour stop in Austin, Tex. "Ranch people, people involved in 
agriculture. We also get people who live in town that still love the rural 
lifestyle and imagery that comes through the songs. . . . The one thing they 
tell me at the autograph lines is they like the music 'cause it's real. For me, 
it's got to be real. That's all I've known my whole life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Al LeDoux was an Air Force pilot; so he, his wife, Bonnie, and their three 
kids moved around a lot -- Mississippi, Long Island, France, Pennsylvania, 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in Austin that 12-year-old Chris got hooked on rodeo. He finished high 
school in Cheyenne and went on to the University of Wyoming on a rodeo 
scholarship, settling in the small town of Kaycee. He got married at 23 and 
kept riding. 
</P>
<P>
 "That first year of bein' married was pretty tough," he recalled. "Drew some 
sorry horses, didn't win much. . . . The winter went well, but then April came 
and we were about to starve out. Livin' in the truck. My wife was pregnant, 
startin' to show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we were pretty well broke, we loved it. Sleep in the truck, get 
up in the mornin', I'd start a fire. My wife would get the fryin' pan out, and 
we'd have French toast along the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her clothes didn't fit 'cause she was pregnant, so she had to wear my pants 
and shirt. I still have this picture of her in my mind, seein' her on an Oregon 
highway walkin' along with my shirt sleeves rolled up and the cuffs on my 
pants, her head down, just kickin' through the grass, her belly stickin' out 
with this new baby." 
</P>
<P>
 LeDoux pauses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose the memories are more fond now than they were makin' them. But I 
think it was a good time for us to go through. It tested both of us." 
</P>
<P>
 It also gave LeDoux things to write about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just loved that life so much I wanted to express it, through poetry or 
music or somethin'. I can remember bein' a young kid in school, I'd write 
stories about bein' in the jungle, huntin' lions or somethin', and eventually 
honed in on this rodeo thing. And eventually it turned into songs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of writin' for myself, then I'd sing these songs for my friends in 
room parties after the rodeo or drivin' down the road, and I'd see their 
reaction. I never planned on makin' a career out of it. It just kind of 
happened. At that time, all I wanted was to ride buckin' horses in the rodeo. 
That's the frame of mind most cowboys are in in their 20s." 
</P>
<P>
 LeDoux won the world bareback riding championship in 1976. But after he tore 
up a knee in the Astrodome, hyper-extended an elbow in Denver and jerked loose 
a collarbone in Phoenix, he eased out of rodeo competition to focus on the 
music and the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 LeDoux, 45, has the handsome chiseled features of the cowboy matinee idols who 
fascinated him as a child. His sparkling blue eyes are open and candid, and 
although he can be laconic as a Gary Cooper, he'll also drift into reveries of 
reminiscence. 
</P>
<P>
 He's admittedly bull-headed -- he spent 5 1/2 years hand-building his house 
with logs he cut and stones he gathered -- and his upright, solid demeanor 
carries the unusual mix of bedrock traditionalist and tolerant free spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris was what I'd call very investigative," said his mother, Bonnie, in a 
separate interview from her home near Nashville. "He was always into all kinds 
of things. He wanted to explore and find out what was over there or what was 
around the corner." 
</P>
<P>
 Says LeDoux: "Travelin' around in a military family . . . we were exposed to a 
lot of different lifestyles, so I'm able to take things as they come. It's 
great to live in one place all your life, but you can get very narrow-minded. 
Because that is your little world and sometimes you might not try to understand 
the way other people live. Maybe you hear someone with a different accent in 
your area and immediately it's foreign to you, so you think it's wrong. I think 
all the travelin' around was real good for me. To accept people for who they 
are inside." 
</P>
<P>
 LeDoux and his wife, Peggy, now have five children, all of whom study piano or 
take fiddle lessons or bang on drums. 
</P>
<P>
 "They try a little bit of everythin', and I just sort of give 'em free rein on 
that," LeDoux said. "But we tell them to stay away from certain things; you 
know, if it's vulgar or anythin' I don't want it in the house. And they're 
pretty good. . . . You can't stifle 'em, pull on the reins too hard, or they're 
gonna bust loose and no tellin' what they'd do." 
</P>
<P>
 At least MTV isn't an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have one channel where we live. We've thought about gettin a satellite 
dish or somethin', but shoot, damn TV, one channel's plenty." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So far on the Liberty label, LeDoux has released two albums and a best-of 
collection, and he's just finishing an album that should come out in June. He 
says his label deal hasn't changed his life too much: The audiences are bigger, 
the operation runs more smoothly, he doesn't have to do everything from driving 
the rig to booking the shows. 
</P>
<P>
 He makes sure there will be time off to spend with the family, but the heavy 
recording and touring pace has left him with one big frustration: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really hard to get in that songwriter's frame of mind when there's so 
many other things goin on. . . . It'd be nice to have some time off to write. 
But then again, you kinda want to be out there takin' the music to the people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like when I write best is when I have like four months of nothin' to 
do and am hungry. But I've got lots to do, and I haven't been hungry for quite 
a while. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes me a long time to write a song. I'll fool with a melody and come up 
with some story line, and it might not feel right and then I'll hammer away and 
try to do somethin' else with it. I really slave over a song. A song like 
'Hooked on an 8 Second Ride,' it took about eight months. Just livin' with it 
and tryin' to hammer out each detail to where it felt exactly right. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done most of my writin' up there at the ranch. . . . I'll just go in the 
basement or I'll go out in the pasture, and once I get tired of sittin' there 
with a guitar I might just take a walk through the hills, take a piece of paper 
and a pencil. You kinda get into your own preoccupied twilight zone. It's 
almost like a spiritual place or a yoga exercise, I guess. A meditation thing. 
It's pretty weird. It's kind of a neat place to go to, but it's hard to get 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a central theme in his music? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I'm probably too close to it to really be able to say. There's a lot of 
the West, a lot of cowboy in it in some form, especially the songs we do at our 
live show. But still there's a kind of universal appeal. You know, we all have 
emotions. You might take a song like 'Hooked on an 8 Second Ride.' It talks 
about ridin' bulls, but still it's an emotion of passion and desire that 
everyone can relate with." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the beginning, the focus was strictly rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't care if anybody understood it except my peers. And then I started 
writin' about subjects that still had a Western attitude but might be a little 
more wide-rangin'. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all are human and we all have the same emotions, and hopefully those 
emotions come through no matter what the subject of the song is." 
</P>
<P>
 If he's broadening his artistic horizons, does he ever feel stuck with that 
image as the rodeo cowboy guy? 
</P>
<P>
 LeDoux seems surprised by the question, maybe even offended. He answers 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, that's what I am. So no, I don't feel stuck with it." 
</P>

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: VARIOUS ARTISTS, "BRACE YOURSELF: A TRIBUTE TO OTIS 
BLACKWELL", SHANACHIE  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS

<P>
 The tack that producer Jon Tiven has taken in this homage to the veteran 
composer of some of rock's biggest hits is perhaps the most revealing of 
several possible routes open to him: He's assembled a wide range of 
contemporary artists to do new versions of rock classics as well as some of 
Blackwell's lesser-known tunes. The lineup, spanning genres and decades, 
includes Graham Parker, Chrissie Hynde, Frank Black, Dave Edmunds, Kris 
Kristofferson, the Smithereens, Joe Ely, Tom Verlaine and Ronnie Spector.And 
that's only about half the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides showing what an economic lyricist and inventive melody writer 
Blackwell was, the album demonstrates how important his songs remain to a wide 
range of contemporary musicians. Blackwell, who was left paralyzed by a stroke 
in 1991, had no bigger champions than Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis. And 
covering their material is always a challenge. But Graham Parker kick-starts 
the album by applying his scowl to "Paralyzed," a minor hit for the King in 
1957. Frank Black is joined by ex-Sex Pistols/Rich Kids member Glen Matlock for 
a suitably reckless version of "Breathless." Ely duets with Sue Foley on an 
earthy "Great Balls of Fire." 
</P>
<P>
 It may be stating the obvious to point out the mismatch between Deborah Harry 
and "Don't Be Cruel" -- she can't sustain a note, or a song, to save her life. 
But a belly-flop like that makes Edmunds' magnificent one-man rendition of 
"Return to Sender" all the more remarkable for the way it perfectly captures 
that song's snappy charm. 
</P>
<P>
 With half the proceeds from album sales going to Blackwell, it makes what is 
already an artistic joy ride doubly worth a recommendation. RANDY LEWIS

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: FREE, "MOLTEN GOLD: THE ANTHOLOGY" (1993), A&M  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "We wanted it very simple. . . . We never wanted to have a gaudy sound," 
Free's drummer, Simon Kirke, reminisces in the booklet that accompanies this 
double CD retrospective. 
</P>
<P>
 This great British blues-rock band didn't need to grease its sound with extra 
ingredients. In Kirke, bassist Andy Fraser, guitarist Paul Kossoff and singer 
Paul Rodgers, Free had four distinctive musical personalities who winnowed rock 
down to its most forceful, high-impact basics. From 1968 to 1973, that approach 
yielded seven albums that were a combination of cleanly brutal sinew, laid-back 
jauntiness, yearning idealism and wrenching romantic drama. It's a sign of the 
universe's flawed nature that Free failed to make it big, while Rodgers and 
Kirke went on to huge success with their comparatively overwrought and 
under-inspired sequel band, Bad Company. 
</P>
<P>
 You could quibble about six or eight of the 30 selections on "Molten Gold," 
but it offers a suitably wide overview of a band that accomplished a great deal 
in a short time, winning the admiration of such famous peers as Eric Clapton, 
Led Zeppelin and the Faces. 
</P>
<P>
 "All Right Now," the band's lone American hit, is the one Free song that 
everybody knows; but "Wishing Well," "Fire and Water," "My Brother Jake" and 
"I'll Be Creepin' " also are among the best that British rock has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers, who set the standard for blues-rock singing during his Free days, 
could summon a remarkable combination of soulfulness and grit, swagger and 
poignancy. Nobody did the tough-guy walk better, yet Free's music also is 
suffused with humor, idealism and compassion. Kossoff, who died in 1976 of 
heart problems compounded by heroin addiction, was a guitarist of incomparable 
economy, equally at home with vicious riffing and elegiac, emotive cries. 
Fraser ranked with Jack Bruce, John Entwistle and Paul McCartney as one of the 
great bassists of British rock, bringing Free's rhythms a funky, loping motion 
that is utterly original. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of Free's six studio albums were uneven, but the other half -- "Fire and 
Water" (1970), "Highway" (1971) and "Heartbreaker" (1973) -- were without 
weaknesses and are sure to satisfy fans of tough, melodic, blues-based rock. 
"Molten Gold" is an enticing introduction to this trove of goodies. MIKE BOEHM

MUSIC; OUT OF SEQUENCE, IT STILL ADDS UP TO BEETHOVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Chris Pasles covers classical music and dance for The Times 
Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If music weren't so mathematical, a person might suspect that the great 
Beethoven had some trouble with numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote four overtures for his sole opera. Three of them bear numbers in 
their titles, but the numbers don't indicate the order in which they were 
written. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Leonore" Overture No. 2 was actually the first. The "Leonore" Overture 
No. 3 was really the second. The "Leonore" No. 1 was the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, by the time he got to writing the fourth, he had changed the name 
of the opera to "Fidelio," so that overture bears that name in the title. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 2, which Robert Thies will play with 
Ami Porat and the Mozart Camerata on Sunday, was written before what is known 
as the Piano Concerto No. 1. It was just published later. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Second Concerto, said Thies, a 23-year-old piano student at USC, "almost 
looks back to Mozart. But you have to make it not sound like Mozart, but like 
Beethoven." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly not the tragic Beethoven that I saw in the Third Concerto that 
I played with Ami last year. At the same time, it shows many faces of 
Beethoven. "It's not tragic, but the Second Movement is certainly one of his 
most tender compositions. It's quite beautiful, and it offers a big contrast to 
just what preceded it and what is going to succeed it as well. There are 
completely different moods." 
</P>
<P>
 On the whole, Thies said, "I would describe the work as very pastoral." 
</P>
<P>
 "You can tell Beethoven looks to nature for inspiration. They always talk 
about Beethoven roaming about the woods with his sketchbook. The Third Movement 
is based around the motif of the cuckoo bird. But he has bird calls in the 
first movement as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, however, "the Second Concerto is more difficult than the Third," 
he added. That might be because in his early days in Vienna, Beethoven was 
basically making a name for himself as a pianist and improviser as well as a 
composer, and probably he wanted something virtuosic to draw attention to his 
talents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard that from other pianists too," Thies said. "It's hard because of 
the passage work. And musically you have a responsibility, as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Who: Pianist Robert Thies with conductor Ami Porat and the Mozart Camerata. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Sunday, April 10, at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, 600 St. Andrews Road, Newport Beach.  
</P>

COMEDY: BOBBY SLAYTON'S TIRADE IS NO POPULARITY CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, Glenn Doggrell writes about comedy for The Times Orange 
County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stand-up comic Bobby Slayton will never be confused with a warm and fuzzy 
performer. Fozzie Bear he isn't. Rather, he is Godzilla opposite Bambi, the pit 
bull opposite the poodle. 
</P>
<P>
 His motto, in fact, is a fine clue to his persona: "Kill or Be Killed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bronx-born, Westchester-raised comedian takes aim at any topic -- gays, 
women, relationships, ethnic and racial minorities, pornography, abortions . . 
. and he can be a bit harsh. For instance, he says that when his wife wanted 
him to discuss his sexual fantasies, Slayton replied: "Why? You're not in any 
of them." 
</P>
<P>
 He has been branded sexist and racist, but he insists it's all in fun -- that 
he's just giving the customers what they're paying for. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not up there to make friends," he has said over the years. "I'm up there 
to make people laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 His thoughts are delivered in a tirade. If you don't like the last one, 
another will be along in a New York second. To Slayton, a good show is when 
someone leaves saying, "I laughed so hard milk was coming out my nose."  
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. resident has appeared on "The Tonight Show," "Arsenio Hall" and 
"Evening at the Improv," as well as in a spot in "Wayne's World 2." He was also 
voted top male stand-up at the American Comedy Club Awards in 1989. Through 
April 17, fans can catch him at the Irvine Improv. 
</P>
<P>
 Slayton's show is not unlike an Indy 500 of jokes from start to finish, but it 
seems as if he's getting more than 500 jokes into his roughly one-hour set. At 
his last run at the Brea Improv in February, the delivery was so fast that 
Slayton often ran roughshod over his own material or talked over his own jokes, 
moving to new material before the audience had a chance to absorb the previous 
batch. 
</P>
<P>
 The 38-year-old Slayton, who is married and has a 5-year-old daughter, has 
been doing comedy since he was 22. And although his oft-raw act has been 
compared to Andrew Dice Clay and the late Sam Kinison, Slayton denies he's from 
that mold. He insists he's not that vicious and urges fans to listen more to 
what he says, as opposed to how he says it. He puts himself somewhere between 
Clay and Jerry Seinfeld. 
</P>
<P>
 Slayton credits Lenny Bruce with teaching him the bottom line is laughter, not 
delivery. Bruce showed that a comic can get away with anything as long as it's 
funny. 
</P>
<P>
 But this bit from Slayton's act exemplifies the sticky question surrounding 
much of his material: When does humor become an ethnic slur? 
</P>
<P>
 "How many Chinese in the world -- a billion Chinese?" he asks. "You know what 
that means? That means if somebody says to you, 'Hey, Mr. Wong. You're a great 
guy, you're one in a million,' there's still a thousand guys just like you." 
</P>
<P>
 Slayton lets you decide. 
</P>
<P>
 Who: Bobby Slayton. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Nightly through Sunday, April 17, except Monday, April 11. Call for show

KID STUFF: DON'T CALL HIM A BOZO; BEHIND THE BULBOUS NOSE AND BAGGY PANTS IS 
SERIOUS SATIRIST AVNER THE ECCENTRIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken covers children's events for The Times 
Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a scene from the 1985 action-comedy film "The Jewel of the Nile," 
writer/adventuress Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner) tries desperately to escape a 
murderous despot by scratching at the mortar of a barred window. Her cellmate, 
an affable holy man known as the Jewel, watches her struggle for a moment then 
calmly places his hand on the bar. The iron grate falls like an overripe fig 
from a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "Magic?," she asks, breathily. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dry rot," he answers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the first of many times in this sequel to "Romancing the Stone," that the 
Jewel, played by Avner Eisenberg, demonstrates to Turner and her co-star 
Michael Douglas that things are not always what they seem. Furthermore, if you 
look at them from the right vantage point, those things can also be pretty 
darned funny. 
</P>
<P>
 As a performer, Eisenberg seems to have a gift for pointing out life's 
absurdities, which may explain why Douglas reportedly hand-picked him for the 
role of the Jewel after seeing him perform his one-man show, Avner the 
Eccentric, in 1984. A combination of mostly silent comedy and a smattering of 
juggling, balancing, wire-walking and other stunts, the show ran on and off 
Broadway during the 1984-85 season. Eisenberg brings the latest version of it 
to the Irvine Barclay Theatre on Saturday and to the La Jolla Playhouse on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoters bill Eisenberg's show as family fare. But even though he says 
children and adults both enjoy his style, during a phone interview from his 
home on Peak's Island in Maine, Eisenberg admitted he isn't exactly thrilled 
with the classification. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are places in the show where my pants fall off, so I've been thinking 
of billing myself as "Avner the Eccentric . . . Partial Nudity!," he joked. 
"Maybe that will get rid of the kids' show label." 
</P>
<P>
 The father of a 5-year-old, Eisenberg says the term family entertainment is a 
euphemism for "kids' shows that parents can stomach." He says a more accurate 
description of his show would be "serious satire . . . which kids will also 
enjoy if they haven't been watching too much television." (In case you were 
wondering, he says there isn't a TV in his house.) 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the 90-minute show, audiences watch and sometimes interact with 
Eisenberg's character, the Eccentric, as he grapples with what one critic 
called the "amazing cussedness of ordinary things." A segment seen on videotape 
shows him attempting to light a cigarette, resulting in a cascade of wooden 
matches and the repeated mysterious disappearance of his hat. Later, a simple 
juggling trick sends him diving for cover from falling baseball bats. Even when 
one of his stunts succeeds -- he "consumes" a stack of paper napkins, then 
"retrieves" them as a yards-long, rainbow-hued strand pulled from his mouth -- 
the Eccentric seems as pleasantly befuddled as his audience. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Atlanta, Eisenberg trained under master mime and teacher Jacques 
LeCoq in Paris (where he claims he was once arrested for public buffoonery for 
performing on the street), and later taught at Carlo Clementi's Dell'Arte 
School of Physical Comedy in Northern California. He has performed his one-man 
show throughout the United States, Europe, Asia and South America, and has been 
featured at the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Europe, they have a different view of the clown," noted Eisenberg. "Here, 
the clown is very much a denigrated figure. Really, it's thought of in terms of 
the American circus clown, the birthday party Bozo . . . that has the funny 
hair and wears too much makeup." 
</P>
<P>
 Eisenberg does wear an understated bulbous nose and generously sized pants in 
his act, but he says the look and the stunts he performs are incidental. The 
real heart of the show, he says, is the development of the character and, as a 
function of that, his interaction with the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "An essential part of drama is the sense that the character has to learn 
something because of what is going on in the play, and that they change because 
of what they learn," he said. "My character is so inept in the beginning that 
he literally can't even open a box of matches. By the end of the show he 
becomes 'ept.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a show about the search for ept-itude." 
</P>
<P>
 Who: Avner the Eccentric. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Saturday, April 9, at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Irvine Barclay Theatre, 4646 Campus Drive, Irvine.

SEARCH FOR OCEAN CREATURES: MORE THAN A DAY AT THE BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Patrick Mott is a free-lance writer who regularly contributes 
to The Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're a bad golfer, you'll probably make a good beachcomber. 
</P>
<P>
 Say you're a 24 handicapper. This means you spend lots of time rooting around 
for your ball in such impenetrable places as ice plants, scrub brush, high 
clover, tall grass and, occasionally, jungle. But you stay with it. You find 
the ball nearly every time. 
</P>
<P>
 Now let's say you're on the beach, at the Dana Point Marine Life Preserve, for 
instance. You're stalking the wild starfish. You pick your way out into the 
shallow water, through the rocks close to shore. A few minutes later you're up 
to your knees in brine, staring like a dog on point at the rocky bottom. 
Staring. And staring. 
</P>
<P>
 This is just like looking for a lost golf ball, or would be if you were 
looking for the ball while peering through a big glass of foamy beer. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right. Because just when you think you're on to something, that there's 
something down there that might be intriguing, a wave washes in and obliterates 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Beachcombing doesn't provide instant gratification. 
</P>
<P>
 I found this out on a recent visit to the Dana Point Marine Life Preserve, 
just beyond the Orange County Marine Institute, where Dana Point comes to an 
actual point at the base of the shale and sandstone cliffs. There, at 
waterside, is a jumble of rocks, boulders and stony outcroppings that form a 
series of tide pools that are ideal homes for all sorts of bite-size marine 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 The beauty part is that you can see these little animals up close without 
skin-diving gear. The trick is to avoid looking like a flamingo on roller 
skates while you're doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Helling had prepared me, sort of. The associate executive director of 
the marine institute, Helling gave me a series of advance tips on tide-pool 
exploration techniques and safety. Never, he said, turn your back on the waves. 
They may lap gently for a few minutes, and "then you can get some sets that are 
larger." Check the tide charts, too, he said, and note when you can expect a 
rising tide. And finally, "never jump from rock to rock." 
</P>
<P>
 I arrived at the marine institute about half an hour before low tide, listed 
that day at 2:55 p.m., and bought a book Helling had recommended: "Pacific 
Intertidal Life," a $2.50 pocket-size guide to the things that ooze through the 
shallows. (Survival tip: Read it before you wade into the water. You'll look 
silly, and feel vulnerable, if you read it during your exploration.) 
</P>
<P>
 Next, I paid a visit to museum volunteer Eula Ryan, who stood above a 
saltwater tank filled with tide-pool creatures and happily explained to a group 
of fascinated kids what each weird-looking thing was. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, armed with an eyeful of my quarry, I climbed down the concrete stairs 
to the beach and the rocks below and waded out into foot-high water around the 
nearest rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 I recalled Helling's "low-impact exploration techniques," remembering that I 
had just entered a wildlife preserve where absolutely everything is protected: 
Don't take anything away with you (including shells and rocks); if you pick an 
animal up, return it to exactly the same place; don't pry at anything with 
sticks, and walk gently, taking care not to step on any marine animals. 
</P>
<P>
 It's that walking gently part you take to heart in a big way. The reason: The 
only thing more slippery than a rock that has just recently been exposed by the 
tide is freshly Zamboni'd rink ice. Most of them are covered with a moss-like 
growth that turns them to butter. Even my ripple-soled surf shoes wouldn't 
grip. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, I didn't think I was seeing much, the result, I suppose, of having 
starfish on the brain. Heck, even the cover of "Pacific Intertidal Life" had a 
starfish on it. All I was finding -- or so I thought -- were anemones -- 
hundreds of anemones. Mostly, I found out later when I read the book, giant 
green anemones and brooding anemones. These are fun to touch lightly, because 
they instantly react and fold up. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the moments between wave surges, I was also seeing limpets (I thought 
they were barnacles) of all sorts, chitons (which looked like tiny prehistoric 
fossils), snails, periwinkles, worm shells, actual barnacles, all sorts of kelp 
and algae, and mussels by the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 But no starfish, or octopuses, or sea slugs, or crabs, or any other tide-pool 
mega-stars. I stayed out there for more than an hour, picking my way over and 
between the slippery rocks like a mountain climber scaling a vertical wall, and 
when I finally decided to give up, I found myself a couple of hundred yards 
from my starting point. I had covered quite a bit more ground than I thought. 
</P>
<P>
 I checked back in with Ryan about the lack of starfish. "Unfortunately," she 
said, smiling a bit wanly, "a lot of people still carry things away." 
</P>
<P>
 Helling, too, had said that "most of the problems that we have are with 
relatively naive visitors" who unknowingly upset the ecology of the preserve. I 
frowned at the memory until I heard a mother with a couple of children in tow 
telling them as they came off the beach, "No, this is a place where you have to 
leave everything where it is." 
</P>
<P>
 I came home empty-handed -- my nylon running pants wet to the hips, my surf 
shoes full of sand -- with the odd satisfaction that while I had not upset the 
balance of the preserve, the slick, wave-tossed, slippery preserve had several 
times almost upset me.

WET & WILD; DIVERS FIND DEPTH OF SEA'S BEAUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, David Haldane is a staff writer for The Times Orange County 
Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The scene looks eerily beautiful at 100 feet beneath the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 The four stilts of Oil Platform Ellen, breaking the monotony of the Pacific 
Ocean like the long spindly legs of some huge exotic seafaring spider, plunge 
relentlessly through the depths. 
</P>
<P>
 I am hanging somewhere in the middle, resting on one of many horizontal 
crossbeams in between, floating dreamily in blue-green space and enjoying the 
view. 
</P>
<P>
 I am here ostensibly to research a story on the harvesting of mussels from the 
stilts of this oil-pumping platform seven miles off Huntington Beach. A 
photographer and I arose early this morning to catch the Shell Oil Co. boat in 
Long Beach Harbor to bring us here. Now, 50 feet above me, I can see the silent 
white flashes reverberating off the huge vertical beams as he photographs the 
commercial divers scraping off the black mussels. 
</P>
<P>
 I have dropped below the other divers to get a larger perspective, and as I 
look around, I am struck by the richness of the marine forest in which I float. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the mussels, the thick vertical and diagonal beams are covered by 
heavy blankets of pink strawberry anemones, mixed with rock scallops and 
brittle stars. Nearby swims a variety of fish, including opaleye, kelp bass, 
cabezon and yellowtail. And everywhere, a sense of lushness pervades -- an 
image of nature thriving wildly amid mechanical human contrivance. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are similar to an island with a fairly steep shelf," said Bob Meek, a 
marine biologist who harvests mussels off oil platforms from Santa Barbara to 
Huntington Beach. "They are like vertical artificial reefs with huge (sunlit) 
zones; you just don't see this density of life" in many other places. 
</P>
<P>
 Diving under oil platforms, however, presents a variety of problems. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, experts say, it is definitely an advanced dive, to be 
undertaken only by those experienced enough to comfortably regulate their 
buoyancy. Because of the depth involved, they say, it is easy for an 
inexperienced diver to inadvertently sink too deep. 
</P>
<P>
 The other matter is that, despite the fact that divers in private boats have 
been exploring beneath the platforms for years, today most oil companies 
discourage such visits as unnecessary intrusions into their working terrain. 
However, some platform workers have reacted with a level of hostility that 
their employers don't condone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had them squirt me with a fire hose," said Tom Murray, the owner of 
Pacific Sporting Goods dive shop in Long Beach who has been diving near various 
platforms for more than a decade. "One guy dropped a steel plate from 10 
stories high that landed 10 feet from my head." 
</P>
<P>
 Oil company officials condemn such behavior and say that if it's brought to 
their attention, they will take steps to make sure it doesn't happen again. But 
they also suggest that, rather than go it alone, divers interested in exploring 
a platform do so with a group -- preferably a dive club or charter organization 
-- that has secured the permission of the company involved. 
</P>
<P>
 One charter firm with such permission is Pacific Diving Adventures of Santa 
Barbara, which regularly runs a small boat out to the Chevron Oil platforms off 
Summerland and Carpinteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably the best diving in California outside the kelp beds," said 
Janice Daily, the company's managing operator. "The colors and the amount of 
life down there are phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
 For $50, she said, a diver can spend half a day (either morning or afternoon) 
exploring the platforms during two dives. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the hostile oil workers, Daily says they've never been a problem on 
her dives. 
</P>
<P>
 "They threaten us with great bodily harm if we don't bring them back a big bag 
of scallops," she quipped. For more information, call the company at (805) 
962-1771.

DO IT!: ROWING PRACTICE IS HALF THE PADDLE

<P>
 With the weather warming, interest in water activities is rising, and young 
outdoor enthusiasts' fancies are turning to paddle sports. And whether you're a 
tyro or a terror, the nonprofit Newport Aquatic Center on Newport Bay can help. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports include canoeing, kayaking and Olympic rowing, with skill levels 
ranging from recreational to very elite, said Sharon Attlesey, a coach at the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Attlesey assists Jim Terrell in coaching the junior kayaking program, which 
last year produced a team that won a U.S. title.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is the time of year we're trying to recruit kids, teach them how to 
paddle and get them ready for the nationals," Attlesey said, referring to the 
August championships.  
</P>
<P>
 The junior program is divided into three age groups: 17-18, 15-16, and 14 and 
under. No experience is necessary, but some athletic ability is a plus. Anyone 
interested in the program can drop in on one of the 9:30 a.m. practice sessions 
Saturdays and Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 In summer, twice-daily practices begin (morning and afternoon). The style 
taught is Olympic flat-water kayaking. Though the sport is little-known by the 
public, Attlesey said it offers scholarship opportunities. (She paid for most 
of her schooling that way). 
</P>
<P>
 First-time paddlers should expect to get a little wet as they learn the 
techniques. The sport is performed in one-seat kayaks on the calm waters of 
bays and inlets such as Upper Newport Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the kind of thing where you can just get in and paddle away," 
Attlesey said. "I had five kids in a class this morning. Collectively, they 
flipped about 20 times." 
</P>
<P>
 The program is geared to producing competition-level kayakers. The coaching is 
funded by the U.S. Canoe and Kayak Team, which has designated Newport Beach as 
an area of high interest and potential. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who opt to join the junior program must pay a yearly fee of $175 (adult 
dues are higher), which includes the instruction and equipment along with use 
of a weight room, showers and locker facilities. 
</P>
<P>

run Saturday. The 10K event includes two hills in its first mile and some 
rolling terrain as it passes the mission and other historic buildings. There 
will also be a 4K fun run, all of it flat. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10K starts at 7:30 a.m., and the entry fee is $20; the 4K starts at 8:30 
a.m. and has a $13 fee. There will be registration before the events.

REWIND: GERMAN CONSCIENCE TAKES THE STAND IN 'JUDGMENT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 What happened to the Nazi regime the day after Oskar Schindler trundled away 
from his munitions factory for the last time, one step ahead of the advancing 
Soviet army? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer lies, in large measure, in the crackling 1961 courtroom drama 
"Judgment at Nuremberg," an ensemble vehicle for some of the most prominent 
stars of the early 1960s that still manages to keep the attention riveted on 
the insidious moral vacuum that became the reason for the Nuremberg war crimes 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Where "Schindler's List" addressed itself, a half-century after the fact, to 
the "what" of the Holocaust, "Judgment at Nuremberg" draws on the "why" -- in 
this case, why would a group of highly respected German judges turn their backs 
on the concepts they once revered and preside during the war over a series of 
infamous kangaroo courts, drumhead courts-martial and false condemnations that 
resulted in the deaths of thousands? 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer Tracy, brilliant as the presiding American judge at the trials of the 
German judges, finds that the answers aren't easy. Playing the simple Maine 
jurist with understated folksy grace and passion, Tracy must sort out 
impassioned arguments by American prosecutor Richard Widmark and German defense 
attorney Maximilian Schell (who won an Oscar for this role) while being jolted 
by testimony from a mentally unbalanced victim (Montgomery Clift) and a 
persecuted hausfrau (Judy Garland). As he grapples with the demons of Germany's 
recent past, he is wooed circumspectly by the widow (Marlene Dietrich) of an 
executed German general and saddened by the descent into corruption of the most 
famous defendant in the dock before him (Burt Lancaster). 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Kramer's direction manages to keep this 178-minute film consistently 
taut, and Abby Mann's Oscar-winning screenplay not only echoes the still-fresh 
moral outrage of the time, but also paints a picture of a Germany agonizingly 
trying -- and sometimes failing -- to come to grips with the memory of 
all-too-recent horrors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judgment at Nuremberg" makes a fine, if disturbing, companion to "Schindler's 
List."  
</P>
<P>
 "Judgment at Nuremberg" (1961), directed by Stanley Kramer. 178 minutes. Not 
rated.

SPECIAL SCREENING: '8 1/2' FINDS FELLINI AT A HIGH OF CREATIVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's hardly an overstatement to say the world lost one of the greats when 
Federico Fellini died last October after a stroke. In the global film 
community, he was part of a legendary triumvirate, with Akira Kurosawa and 
Ingmar Bergman. 
</P>
<P>
 All three imprinted their own styles -- based on determinedly personal, often 
odd visions -- on their movies. The result was many unique films that come 
easily to mind, that are studied and restudied and, finally, serve as documents 
to the progress of this century's most populist art medium. All three also 
helped to create a respect in this country for international movies that wasn't 
there before. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellini undoubtedly made his biggest mark, at least in America, with "8 1/2," 
probably the most autobiographical of his works.  
</P>
<P>
 The 1963 picture, which opens UC Irvine's "Off the Beaten Path" series 
tonight, not only won the Oscar for best foreign film, but Fellini was 
nominated for best director and best screenplay. He didn't win either, but just 
being named was an unusual honor for a foreign filmmaker at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie has since been revived in the States repeatedly, both in art houses 
and on campuses. Any film student can expect to watch it in a darkened 
classroom and later dissect all of its fantasy-oriented imagery until boredom 
sets in. Never a boring movie, "8 1/2" carries the responsibility of being a 
legitimate cinema masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 A few critics, respected ones, too, haven't always felt that way. With its 
hypnotic visuals and free-flowing, jerk-and-startle symbolism, some writers say 
"8 1/2" is simply meaningless. Fellini, they argue, just startles, he doesn't 
inform. 
</P>
<P>
 Steadier, more open minds know that's all hogwash. Fellini may be one of the 
most indulgent of the great directors (the ever-precise Kurosawa is the least 
indulgent; Bergman certainly has his flourishes of confusing self-expression), 
but his film idiosyncrasies are illuminations into his mind, a chaotic and 
boldly fertile place. Even when they're pushy and convoluted, his captured 
images fascinate with pure vivacity. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of "8 1/2" comes not only from the fact that Fellini had reached a 
mature plateau where his inspirations melded with his technical skill, but 
because of the personal and professional uneasiness he felt before and during 
the film's making. In the 1950s, he had already been hailed as a master, 
especially after the widespread success of "La Strada," probably his most 
poignant picture. 
</P>
<P>
 But where to go from there?  
</P>
<P>
 "8 1/2" is ultimately a meditation, and frequently an unhappy one, on the 
limits of creativity, especially when the creator wrestles with the 
complexities of his own life that keep clouding the horizon. Fellini goes for 
the big issues -- religion and love, death and memory, art and self-awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 His alter-ego is Guido (Marcello Mastroianni), a director drained of ideas. He 
can't finish his latest movie, a mash of autobiography involving his wife 
(Anouk Aimee), his mistress (Sandra Milo) and even a sci-fi subplot that is 
apropos of nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the vivid scenes comes late in the film, when Guido and his cast visit 
the set, a mass of girders and infrastructure, and the director tries to decide 
where the spaceship will land. It's funny, but says something about Guido's 
deteriorating concentration in this storm that is his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "8 1/2" actually is a catalogue of striking and famous scenes. The opening 
passage has tantalized cinema historians with its metaphorical sweep. Guido, 
stuck in traffic and suffocating in his exhaust-filled car, slips through the 
passenger's window and begins to float above the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, he's in the clouds, with only a rope tied to his leg. He's happy, free, 
but someone begins pulling him to land. It's an obvious symbol -- the 
constraints of responsibility versus the joys of liberation -- but the images 
seem so fresh and vivid that they can't help but be seductive. 
</P>
<P>
 Always the charmer, Fellini reached a rarefied high with "8 1/2" -- it may be 
his most seductive movie. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Federico Fellini's "8 1/2." 
</P>
<P>
 When: Friday, April 8, at 7 and 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>

RESTAURANTS: SKINNY HAVEN IS A HEALTHFUL CHOICE FOR EVERY BODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone is so health-conscious nowadays, it's surprising there aren't more 
health food restaurants around. Maybe the reason is just this simple: When 
people go out for a meal, they want to have a special occasion, eat an extra 
bite of dessert and so forth.  
</P>
<P>
 No problem. There are health-conscious restaurants like Skinny Haven that post 
nutritional breakdowns along their own private stretch of the information 
superhighway, so you can toss caution around without actually throwing it to 
the wind. You can have your, ahem, cake and eat it too. 
</P>
<P>
 Skinny Haven is a small chain with franchises in Fullerton and Santa Ana, and 
don't call it a diet restaurant, thank you. Managing partner Reza Alavi likes 
to think of his place as a "healthy place to dine, with something for 
everybody." So all the food is low in fat, cholesterol and sodium.  
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana branch is simple and clean, taken up with an abundance of vinyl 
booths and one long, well-endowed salad bar. It's a lively place too. On Friday 
and Saturday evenings there is entertainment, often singing. Sunday brunch 
features a string quartet playing Mozart within a bow's length of the low-fat 
dressings. 
</P>
<P>
 Just inside the door you pass a mini-mart stocked with fat-free tortilla 
chips, sugar-free candies, flavored rice cakes and heart-healthy cookbooks. 
"This is what my life has become," lamented one of my friends as he eyeballed 
the candies, trying his best to ignore the chocolate mousse banana pie. 
</P>
<P>
 How little he knew. According to the restaurant's data, the mousse pie turns 
out to be a dessert his diet allows. It is made with artificial sweeteners and 
low-fat milk solids, two of this kitchen's favorite tricks for reducing 
calories. 
</P>
<P>
 The usual salads, steamed vegetables and skinless chicken preparations abound 
on the menu, but more surprises crop up: barbecued short ribs, lasagna, pizza 
and even veal knackwurst, all reduced in fat content and portion size. The 
foods are justified by a nutritional sheet listing calories and fat grams that 
you can pick up at the cashier stand.  
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, common sense plays a part. The knackwurst, for instance, is all 
veal, as opposed to more caloric beef. But it does contain 40 grams of fat, the 
highest on this menu. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection is also quite international. An appetizer called chicken 
skewers, with its fine sesame dipping sauce, reminds me of the Japanese snack 
yakitori , though the pieces are completely trimmed of fat. There are chicken 
nachos, too, made with a fat-free crisp bread and served with a chunky tomato 
salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything made with cheese implies more a liberal calorie allowance, but I 
particularly like the Skinny Haven quesadilla: a crisp grilled taco shell with 
fillings like Cajun spiced chicken and yellow cheese. Less worthwhile is the 
pizza, with its dry oat bran crust. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the main courses are served with a choice of two side dishes: a plain 
steamed vegetable medley, pasta Alfredo made with a low-fat milk-based Alfredo 
sauce or a bland rice pilaf. For $1 more, you can take a trip to the salad bar 
or have a cup of soup. The soups, incidentally, are good and homey. Chicken 
noodle has an authentic down-home flavor, and sometimes there's a good, thick 
three-bean with a cumin-spiked broth. 
</P>
<P>
 The knackwurst entree does not conform to the heart-healthy guidelines, but it 
still manages to be lower in fat and calories than an ordinary hot dog. I like 
it because it is served on a bed of crunchy sauerkraut (though I wrinkled my 
nose when the waitress asked me if I wanted low-fat mayonnaise).  
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican combo platter includes a chicken enchilada, chili relleno, beef 
burrito, rice and beans. All the components, save the rather dried-out beans, 
are tasty -- so tasty it's hard to believe this generous plate contains only 
779 calories. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll have to suspend belief even further when you order boneless short ribs. 
I understand how chicken can be trimmed of fat; it's harder to imagine nicely 
marbled short ribs as a low-fat food. Nonetheless, these ribs -- tender and 
juicy under a blanket of barbecue sauce -- total 356 calories for a four-ounce 
portion.  
</P>
<P>
 The best sandwich is probably the turkey burger, a flavorful patty on a sesame 
seed bun with lettuce, tomato and low-fat mayo. 
</P>
<P>
 Now for the desserts, which you see on every table here. Black Forest cake is 
crowned with chocolate sauce, soft-serve ice milk, whipped topping, nuts and 
even some cherries, but only provides 210 calories. 
</P>
<P>
 A creamy peanut butter cake has the loftiest count on the dessert menu: 355 
calories. It's a scoop of real peanut butter in a square of sweet yellow cake, 
and it was enough to make my diet-conscious friend remark something about a 
spoonful of peanut butter containing 15 grams of fat. 
</P>
<P>
 Spoilsport. Well, there's always another option -- maybe the fudgy brownie or 
the soft-serve ice cream (a mere 20 calories per ounce in flavors like almond 
butter toffee, mud pie and vanilla).  
</P>
<P>
 Skinny Haven is inexpensive to moderate. Appetizers are $1.95 to $4.95. Main 
dishes are $3.95 to $6.95. Desserts are $2 to $3.25.

PARKER'S PLACE: A CORRESPONDENCE COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. Jefferson Parker, T. Jefferson Parker is a novelist and writer who lives 
in Orange County. His column appears in OC Live! the first three Thursdays of 
every month. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a way of bringing a little goodness to daily life while putting off the 
unpleasant as long as possible, I've developed the Citizens' Mail Prioritizing 
System (patent pending) that seems to be working well. I am happy to share it. 
</P>
<P>
 STEP 1: Gather up your newly arrived mail, then stand over the nearest trash 
can or perhaps in the yard of an unpleasant neighbor and toss all of the junk 
mail into the can or onto the grass. This immediately gets rid of all the 
supermarket ads, the coupon booklets and credit card propositions that should 
be illegal to send out anyway because so many trees are destroyed to make the 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 STEP 2: Take what remains and rapidly flip through it. Set aside anything that 
looks like personal correspondence or checks. Then take the rest -- mostly 
bills, of course, but not always -- and set them on a small unpadded surface of 
some kind. (A bar stool, wooden chair or crowded counter is ideal, as Step 6 
will illustrate.) You are now free to forget about these intrusive items. 
</P>
<P>
 STEP 3: Tear immediately into the personal letters. Few pleasures in life can 
match a genuine handwritten missive from somewhere you're not. They're like 
dispatches from your own private intelligence network. Recently I've had the 
honor of receiving news from Oshkosh, Neb.; Cheyenne, Wyo.; Eaton, Colo.; 
Athol, Mass.; Taveuni, Fiji; Paris, France, and from several points in my 
favorite of all -- Orange County, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 STEP 4: Open checks and set them by the front door of your place. For the next 
two or three days leave them there, neatly positioned, and glance at them each 
time you leave or enter the house. Appreciate their integrity, the way this 
little legal document can actually be drawn up on paper featuring highlights 
from, say, Disneyland, the American Southwest, or a skier going down a 
mountain. Take pride in the fact that they are made out to you. Imagine the 
pleasure of endorsement, deposit, cash back. 
</P>
<P>
 STEP 5: When you are tired of reorganizing these windblown checks, which will 
lift off and fly around your home like tiny magic carpets every time you open 
or close the door, take them to the bank and assign them their fate. 
</P>
<P>
 STEP 6: Toward the end of 30 days, the bills and mystery mail stacked on the 
bar stool or counter (see Step 2) will begin to slide off or fall down. It is 
important that bills be stored in a place where they will either slip to the 
floor or tip over, because this will be your cue that the bills are almost due 
to be paid. It will happen two to four times a day. When you are angry enough 
about having to pick up these dread documents, it is time to move them to a 
large, uncluttered table or desk. 
</P>
<P>
 STEP 7: Leave these unopened bills on the desk or table for another one to 
three days. This is a little breather, a reward for taking the next step toward 
paying them, a rest before the unpleasant demands of Step 8. 
</P>
<P>
 STEP 8: Open one bill at a time, throw away all the attendant junk that bills 
contain these days, go right to the bottom line, and write a check to cover it. 
</P>
<P>
 Do not thoroughly scrutinize each bill for accuracy; companies maintain huge 
staffs of people to make sure that you neither underpay nor overpay. If you've 
overpaid, the "credit due" statement on the next bill will be a significant 
mood lifter. 
</P>
<P>
 It is critical to achieve the proper state of mind while writing out checks to 
cover exorbitant bills for things such as bottled water, credit card interest, 
home mortgages and insurance. You must look upon each payment you make as a 
victory over the cruel machinery of capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, you should consider it a triumph over the phone company when you 
pay them for your calls to Rio; you should be proud that you've averted the 
threat of a scandal-ridden water district's discontinuing your water service as 
you write the check. When you pay a ton of money to the gas or propane company, 
look on this act proudly. It is an act of heroism, a blow struck for the little 
guy. They are all trying to bankrupt you, and you have won, for now. Gloat. 
</P>
<P>
 Never write your account number on a check for the convenience of the company 
receiving it. And never write "amount paid" in the box on the return portion of 
the bill. If they can't read their own bill, find their number on it, and 
understand how much your check is written for, these are their problems, not 
yours. 
</P>
<P>
 (The obvious exception to this rule is the IRS or Franchise Tax Board of 
California, two organizations that actually might not be able to find your 
Taxpayer ID Number on the forms they send to you. Fill in this number for them. 
Go ahead and fill in the "amount paid" blank also, in the likely event that 
your check will simply mystify them. Look on these acts as something akin to 
helping an unthankful elderly blind person across a busy street.) 
</P>
<P>
 STEP 9: Take a few moments to leisurely pore over the mail that was segregated 
in Step 2 but isn't bills. These are the real wild cards, stuff that can be 
exciting or banal, but always unexpected.

 A recent sampling of my own included a renewed U.S. passport in which I look 
like a dazed and bloated toad; an anarchist newsletter published by local high 
school students that contained excerpts from a gay porn magazine called Spunk; 
a belated birthday card containing a Sizzler Senior Club Discount membership; 
and a newsletter from an insurance company featuring a cover story that begins, 
"Taking personal time each day to do the things we truly enjoy is something 
everybody should do," and has an article inside called "Laughing Gas Dangers." 
Enjoy these offbeat treasures.

 STEP 10 (optional): If you subscribe to a cable TV system, check your bill to 
see if you've been charged for "property tax." If your bill is like mine, you 
indeed will have been charged, and you may wonder why the gigantic check you 
write out to "Bob" Citron twice a year isn't enough, unless he needs more to 
cover his own cable bills. Make some phone calls to find out why you're paying 
property tax every month to the same people who thrust the Home Shopping 
Channel in your face, and while you're at it, ask why "Bob" pads his name with 
those furtive quotation marks. Please write me a letter and let me know what 
you find out.

 I'd like to correct a mistake in my March 3 column about trying to ride a 
horse. I wrote that the horse "reared" when in fact he only stopped and pulled 
back his head as another horse intruded into his area. As an over-excitable 
non-rider, I labeled this "rearing," though, as any horse person knows, it is 
certainly not. My sincere apologies to the fine instructors at the Club riding 
school at the Sycamore Trails stables in San Juan Capistrano.

3-HOUR TOUR: THIS BIT OF THE GREAT OUTDOORS ISN'T OUT OF THE WAY 
</P>

 When you're longing for a taste of the outdoors but don't want to drive very 
far, O'Neill Regional Park is a good place to visit. 
</P>
<P>
 This hilly park, home to oak and sycamore woodlands, is on Orange County's 
eastern border. But it seems worlds away from the bustle of Anaheim or Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 10 to 10:20: Park inside O'Neill's lot -- you'll pay a $2 fee -- and walk over 
to Live Oak Canyon Stables, just across the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The stables offer guided, hourlong horseback tours of the park for $20 a 
person. Two trails, of the highlands and lowlands, are available. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you don't rent a horse, the stately animals trotting around these 
corrals are worth a look. 
</P>
<P>
 10:20 to noon: Rangers will give you a map at the entrance to the park. Choose 
a path -- the Mesa area or Oak Grove -- and you're off. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mesa offers an uphill walk and some spectacular views of the foothills. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Grove, a level pathway, has a jungle gym, swings and slides. There is also 
an arboretum at the far end. 
</P>
<P>
 We chose the Mesa for our walk, which was a bit more than an hour long, one 
way, with several stops to view the foothills below. 
</P>
<P>
 One warning about the Mesa walk: It is bordered by a condominium development 
to the south, so the feeling of getting away from it all is hard to sustain. 
But if you keep looking left (northward), you'll be fine. 
</P>
<P>
 One particular beauty of the Mesa walk is the old craggy oaks. Many have 
dropped branches that are big enough themselves to be mature trees. These are 
easy trees to climb, and their strong foundations lead to daydreams of 
treehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 If you choose to take the Oak Grove path instead, an exit at the far end of 
the park allows you to walk over to Rose Canyon Road and Senor Lico's 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Mesa path, you would have to scramble down a steep hill to exit, so 
it's best to plan to walk back to the park entrance and take Trabuco Canyon 
Road to Senor Lico's. 
</P>
<P>
 Noon to 1: Senor Lico's is a charming restaurant, with prices from $7 to $10 
for Mexican entrees. American dishes, such as hamburgers, are slightly less. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant offers indoor and outdoor seating. The tables behind the 
restaurant are quiet and shaded by huge oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The fajitas and shrimp tostada were very good. But the service was a little 
slow on the day we visited, so be prepared to relax and spend some time. 1.

BOOKS & AUTHORS: IN HARMONY WITH 'MAYA COSMOS'; RESEARCHING THE ANCIENT 
PEOPLE'S BELIEFS, SAYS JOY PARKER OF SAN CLEMENTE, CHANGED HER WORLD VIEW AND 
STARTED HER ON HER OWN SPIRITUAL JOURNEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Maya -- the Indians found on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, Guatemala, Belize 
and Honduras -- were known as one of the world's most highly developed 
civilizations. They were master astronomers and architects, brilliant statesmen 
and great warriors. Highly literate, they created one of the most subtle and 
sophisticated languages in the ancient world, and scribes -- an honored social 
class prized second only to priests and kings -- wrote beautifully illustrated 
books on bark paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Maya civilization was in decline when the Spanish conquistadors 
arrived in the early 1500s, the Spanish influence squashed any social 
reorganization the Maya were undergoing at the time: Over a 75-year period, 90% 
of the estimated 7 million Maya died of smallpox, measles and other European 
diseases. In converting them to Catholicism, Spanish priests burned virtually 
all of the Maya books. And over the past 500 years the Maya have been removed 
from their ancestral lands so the land could be used for huge plantations. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, says Joy Parker, co-author of a new book on the Maya, many of their 
religious traditions and their world view have survived over the centuries in 
one form or another. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's astonishing," says Parker, a San Clemente resident. "When the Maya look 
at the world they have a lot more in common with their ancestors who lived 
2,000 years ago than they do with you and I." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Maya Cosmos: Three Thousand Years on the Shaman's Path" (Morrow; $30), 
Parker and her co-authors -- archeologist David Freidel and linguist and art 
historian Linda Schele -- examine Maya mythology and religion. In so doing, 
they show how the 5 million Maya living in Latin America today have managed to 
preserve their most sacred beliefs over the centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker offers two explanations for that. 
</P>
<P>
 "One is just pure stubbornness," she says. "The Maya must be the strongest 
people on the face of the Earth, I'm convinced, because they went through 
terrible persecution and repression after the Spanish conquest 500 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 The second reason, she says, "is the fact that there were so many parallels 
between the Catholic religion and the Maya religion as far as symbols." 
</P>
<P>
 The Maya took the Catholic saints and gave them Maya characteristics and 
blended them with their pantheon of gods, she says. And the central religious 
symbol of the Maya is the "World Tree," which they represented as a cross. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here these Catholic friars come along and hold up a cross (and say) 'You are 
going to worship this,' " says Parker. "Basically, the Maya managed to preserve 
a sort of inner life: Nobody knows what you're thinking when you kneel down in 
church. I've seen this over and over again -- in the American Indians, the 
Maya, the Africans, and you see it the Jewish nation too: The one thing that 
keeps them going is their spiritual belief." 
</P>
<P>
 "Maya Cosmos," which has received praise for not being a dry academic report, 
shows how Schele came to the realization that the many cosmological symbols in 
Maya art can be "woven together into a coherent, eminently logical pattern that 
is, in essence, a map of the sky." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Schele discovered that the World Tree actually represents the Milky 
Way galaxy. (In the Maya creation story, Parker explains, their god lifted the 
sky above the Earth using the World Tree at the center as a kind of giant 
cosmic support column.) 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Maya looked up at the Milky Way they were seeing the World Tree," 
says Parker, adding that Schele's discovery "shed light on many Maya 
astronomical and religious writings that we had not understood clearly before. 
It was like finding a Rosetta Stone to a lot of images and written 
information." 
</P>
<P>
 "Maya Cosmos," which USA Today calls "a tour de force" that "will take its 
place among the best books on the Maya," comes on the heels of a 1990 book 
Parker ghost-wrote for Freidel and Schele: "A Forest of Kings," a critically 
acclaimed history of the pre-Spanish Maya based on newly deciphered 
hieroglyphic of the Classic era (300-900 AD). 
</P>
<P>
 Parker will sign "Maya Cosmos" from 1 to 3 p.m. Saturday at Waldenbooks in the 
Brea Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-described "refugee from New York City who moved to San Clemente 18 
months ago," Parker has an unusual background for someone writing books about 
the indigenous world: She's a classically trained singer who earned her living 
specializing in avant-garde and Elizabethan music. 
</P>
<P>
 But after eight years of singing in restaurants, at art gallery openings and 
in small concerts, Parker says, she wanted to take her life in a different 
direction: to devote full-time to writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music is something you start very young," says Parker, 41, who began taking 
voice lessons at 12. "You're not really mature enough to make a choice. I 
always loved writing, and it was always something I thought I would get back 
to." 
</P>
<P>
 Having written short stories and poems over the years, she enrolled in the 
graduate writing program at New York University in 1987. She was teaching 
writing at NYU when an editor at William Morrow linked her up with Freidel and 
Schele to write "A Forest of Kings." 
</P>
<P>
 By then Parker was also fiction editor of Blue Light Red Light, a literary 
magazine that published magical realism, which she defines as a school of Latin 
American writing that deals with daily life as seen through the eyes of magic 
and the spiritual. 
</P>
<P>
 That background -- along with several courses in anthropology -- was good 
preparation for collaborating with the Freidel and Schele, who are considered 
two of the leading Maya scholars. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I met with David and Linda, I knew we were on the same 
wavelength," says Parker, whose job was to make the writing of two scholars 
more accessible to a broader audience. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say she wasn't daunted by the prospect of writing a book about 
an ancient civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was actually a little scared, to tell you the truth," she says. "I thought 
it was a huge project, but I love challenges -- being pushed beyond my 
boundaries. It was too good a challenge to pass up: I had an opportunity to 
learn from people working in the field 25 years or more, to learn another way 
of looking at the world that was radically different from my western viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another thing I've truly come to believe is you can't look at your own 
culture clearly until you step outside of its boundaries. So when I stepped 
into the Maya world, I looked back at my world and went, 'Whoa, things aren't 
the way I thought they were.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In studying the Maya, she says, "I'd say my spiritual sense of the world was 
deepened. I became much more aware of the environment, the importance of 
nature. This was especially meaningful for me because I was living in New York 
City at the time. I'd say it really started me off on my spiritual journey." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker said she began working with a spiritual teacher, a woman trained in a 
Peruvian tradition of shamanism. It was, she says, an eye-opening experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing it does it helps you to see how your own culture limits you. 
Our culture says you can do this, but you can't do that with your life. Our 
culture trains us to discourage what Joseph Campbell calls 'Follow your bliss,' 
to do the things that you want to do the most. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say that working with the shaman has really taught me to know myself 
inside and out. Shamans were the first psychologists, long before Jung and 
Freud and all those guys. They help people to really work through their 
problems -- whatever kind of identity crisis we're going through -- and get 
things together and go forward with our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Since working with Freidel and Schele on the two Maya books, Parker has served 
as editor on "Of Water and Spirit: Ritual, Initiation, and Magic in the Life of 
an African Shaman" with Malidoma Some, a West African shaman/diviner. She also 
is co-editing, with Native American writer Joseph Bruchac, an anthology that 
examines how Native American ceremonies have preserved the Indian culture and 
have had a deep effect upon the lives of non-Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker says that despite the temptation to romanticize indigenous people, it's 
a mistake. She concedes, however, that learning about the Maya has had a 
profound effect on her life. 
</P>
<P>
 The book she's currently writing on her own -- "Dancing in the Footsteps of 
the Elders" -- is not about the Maya, she says, "but I'll certainly use what I 
learned about the Maya in it." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a book that compares the attitude toward the elders in indigenous 
cultures to our society," she says. "In indigenous cultures an old person is 
the most important person in the culture: They're the wisdom keepers. They're 
the leaders. They're the people everyone turns to for the answers, especially 
the children.  
</P>
<P>
 But in our culture, she says, "old people are kind of the people we'd like to 
get rid of -- they're (considered) not very useful; they're slow, not very 
smart. We certainly don't honor them. People feel bad about getting old in our 
culture -- it's not a good thing -- and I think we are the losers in having 
that attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker, in fact, says there is a direct connection between the loss of the 
influence of the grandparents in our culture and things such as gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "In traditional cultures the grandparents initiate the young; they help them 
to become men and women. In our culture, there's no one to take kids by the 
hand and bring all of that energy they have into the adult world," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a saying in traditional cultures that if the older people don't help 
the younger people to add their energy to the fire at the center of the 
community that the young people will turn around and burn down the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen this happen quite literally recently, haven't we? What do people 
do during riots? They start to burn. To me, it's like in this culture children 
are basically being lost. We complain about the inadequacy of the education 
system, but it's much deeper than that. It has to do with the fact that the 
family structure has fallen apart. People have forgotten about how the dynamics 
of human relationships work." 
</P>
<P>
 And by looking at both the Maya African cultures, she says, it becomes 
apparent "that all the bad things that indigenous people say are going to 
happen to the world if the elders are forgotten are the very things that are 
happening in our culture now."

THE SCENE: THEY'RE CLEAN-CUT -- BUT WITH AN EDGE; THEIR MUSIC IS HARD-CORE -- 
SO IS THEIR STAND AGAINST MEAT, DRUGS, RACISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While punk rock's caustic stylings have served everyone from liberal urban 
philosophers to Aryan skinheads, it's in its evolution as "straight-edge 
hard-core" that this genre has been able to surprisingly succeed where many 
drug education programs have failed.  
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar High juniors Gabe and Jon Bowne started listening to this brand 
of hard-core through their older brother when they were still in seventh grade. 
The twins, now 18, were aware of their brother's drug- and alcohol-free 
lifestyle and that the aggressive, thrashing sounds he listened to was called 
straight-edge. They even gave an ear to the lyrics, which rally against drugs, 
meat, racism, sexism, homophobia and apathy. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I wasn't at a point where I could take it all too seriously," recalls 
Jon. "It wasn't until about seven months ago that the whole drug thing started 
to bug me. I was with friends who were smoking. I wasn't. I just watched them 
and it really bugged me." 
</P>
<P>
 For Gabe, it took the embarrassing "Animal House"-type antics of some wasted 
classmates last year to question the goings-on at typical high school parties. 
"I still cared about the whole society thing at school. I was at this one party 
where people were getting pretty drunk, and I thought: This sucks. Who are they 
fooling? I just started thinking more about how stupid drinking was." 
</P>
<P>
 Although both had already been attending gigs featuring straight-edge bands 
for a couple of years, it wasn't until their individual epiphanies that they 
both bought into the music's message and re-evaluated their concept of what's 
cool. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the people I know I used to be friends with because they partied," 
says Gabe. "They were the popular ones at my school. I'm not really friends 
with a lot of them anymore. I don't like what they do, but I can't tell them 
what to do. They 'row' us a lot about being straight-edge and they say 
sarcastic stuff -- like because I don't drink I'm a loser with no life. I just 
sit back and laugh. Since I got away from all of that, my self-esteem is so 
much higher." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Self-realization and the confidence that comes with it is a natural side 
effect. Straight-edgers note that since getting into the scene they've become 
less concerned with what their peers say and more aware of their inner 
strengths. The discovery has led to respect for their own bodies and minds. 
This along with the many indulgences sacrificed are concepts borrowed from 
Hinduism. In their search for cleaner living, some veteran scenesters have even 
become practicing Krishnas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Austerity builds strength," says long-timer Ray Cappo, whose current band, 
Shelter, counts both a straight-edge and Krishna following. "If everyone else 
is indulging and you're renouncing, it makes you strong." Cappo's former band 
during the mid-'80s, Youth of Today, is credited with spreading the word and 
its raucous soundtrack from its Washington, D.C., base out West. Although the 
band broke up in 1989, records released on an independent label are still being 
pressed, and bootleg tapes of live shows are still circulating. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene's label, according to Cappo, came from a 1982 Minor Threat song 
"Straight Edge." Says Cappo: "Hard-core is not that different from punk. It's 
fast, energetic, loud. But kids into straight-edge don't look punk. They're 
clean-cut." 
</P>
<P>
 Albeit not by preppy standards. Mostly white teen-age boys, many of them are 
skateboarders, so their clothes and overall style reflect that subculture. The 
only identifying mark of their allegiance to straight-edge is a large X on the 
back of their hands like those inked on minors at club gigs. Bartenders know 
not to serve anyone with an X. The self-made brand, however, is something that 
has become less in vogue because most don't want to face the flak they get for 
denouncing partying. 
</P>
<P>
 Girls constitute a tiny percentage, while ethnic diversity is even less 
existent. This is one of the ironies of straight-edge. After all, the lyrics 
tout unity and equality for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess white males are the ones that need the preaching to the most," notes 
Cappo. "But it is open to everyone. The harder stuff (music) seems not to 
appeal to most girls. It's like slam-dancing is an all-male sport." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More than a decade since the release of the Minor Threat anthem, the scene is 
still very much underground, still untouched by corporate marketing. 
Straight-edge bands, like most hard-core, usually appear on independent record 
labels and the product is distributed through alternative record shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has long been home to several such labels, some fly-by-night, 
and others that have been around since the late '80s, such as New Age Records 
in Mission Viejo and Conversion and Revelation in Huntington Beach. (Cappo was 
instrumental in Revelation's early years). Band names, like those of the record 
companies, are also symbolic of straight-edge agenda: Ressurrection, Inside 
Out, Unbroken, Function and Uniform Choice.  
</P>
<P>
 Even 'zines take on such titles as Focus or XaloneX (take away the Xs and you 
understand the authors' teen-age Angst). High-schoolers on the East and West 
coasts communicate through 'zines, covering everything from the virtues of 
veganism to the those of a lost girlfriend. They're definitely a revealing 
study for anyone interested in finding out what makes a teen guy tick. These 
crude publications are typed on a home PC and copied and stapled at 
after-school jobs (some even thank their bosses in the editor's note). Their 
mags are then sold in independent record stores. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With all the pressures to party in high school, it really is the ultimate sign 
of rebellion to just say no. 
</P>
<P>
 For straight-edgers, such as Foothill junior Jeremy Sirota, rejecting a 
cigarette or a hamburger is also resisting taking part in the corporate world. 
"If you're smoking or drinking, you're not really rebelling against society, 
because the cigarette and alcohol companies are among the biggest controlling 
industries in the nation. So is the farming of animals, which I do not want to 
be a part of. (He does consume eggs and milk products, which he eventually 
wants to cut out, too.) So by doing it, you're supporting them. Doing it is so 
mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy, 17, admits he got drunk maybe 10 times before renouncing alcohol, 
drugs and meat late last year. "I didn't like having hangovers. I didn't like 
not being in control. I like doing things where I don't have to worry about 
driving, what I'm saying or what I'm doing to other people. I just don't want 
to be addicted to anything."  
</P>
<P>
 By his definition, addiction includes thirsting for a beer after work in order 
to relax. A glass of wine with dinner also gets a frown. So his parents' 
occasional decision to have a cold brewski with pizza doesn't go over too well. 
"I specifically told my mom that I would never, ever get a beer for her," 
Jeremy says. "If she's too lazy to go get it, well, I'm not going to support 
her by getting it for her. There's no need for her to do it even if she's 
tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Ouch. But what's most admirable about this righteous talk is that it's born 
out of rage and channeled through a lifestyle that's as healthful as it is 
unconventional. And, there's expressing it by slamming in a pit to hard-core 
tunes. It's a rage for what's going on among their peers who get trashed just 
to be accepted. A rage for the confusing changes they're personally going 
through. Not to mention the planet's problems; the environment they have to 
contend with. 
</P>
<P>
 If straight-edgers had a book of rules -- which they don't -- it would 
probably include the one about how if you want something done, you do it 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids aren't going to do what adults tell them," notes Jeremy. "That's why 
those drug-awareness programs are worthless. We're not going to listen unless 
we want to. But the leaders of straight-edge, the bands, the people at shows 
are people my own age. We can associate with the music. The scene is saying, 
'You don't have to do drugs or drink. There are people your own age not doing 
this.' "

ET CETERA; BATS PUSH ENVELOPE OF FATHERING SKILLS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Consider the modern father: attending birthing classes, changing diapers, 
baby-sitting while Mom goes to the office. Could child-rearing be more 
egalitarian? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps. Boston University biologist Thomas H. Kunz and his colleagues report 
in the journal Nature that male bats in the family Dyacopterus spadiceus can 
grow breasts and secrete milk. 
</P>
<P>
 Although male lactation has been seen occasionally in domesticated animals, 
presumably due to severe in-breeding, the discovery marks the first evidence of 
milk production in wild male mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 It hints at the tantalizing (to some) possibility that with the right kind of 
hormonal manipulation men, too, might someday be able to suckle their young. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kunz said it isn't clear whether the male bats actually serve as wet 
nurses. The amount of milk they make is less than one-tenth that made by 
females, and their nipples don't show the hardening that comes from being 
tugged upon by young mouths.

 To the mourners at her father's funeral, Lynn Barlow was a wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she had lost both her father and her breast to cancer in a span of 
three months, she was bearing up without any signs of strain. 
</P>
<P>
 Her doctor had told her husband, Rich, that the stoicism might crack. But as 
the months wore on, there was no sign of it.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was beginning to be confident we weren't going to have a low low -- a 
bottom out," he said. "But when it hit, it was like a bomb went off." 
</P>
<P>
 Rich came home one day, eight months after Lynn's mastectomy in 1986, to what 
looked like ground zero. Lynn had emptied her closet and strewn her clothes 
throughout the house. She was huddled on their bed, sobbing uncontrollably. It 
took a tranquilizer to calm her enough so she could speak, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "She said: 'I'm not a whole person. How can you love me? Why do you love me?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 In the months that followed, the Barlows, who live in the new Orange County 
development Aliso Viejo, struggled to keep their marriage intact. Like other 
couples, they came to realize that breast cancer not only invades a woman's 
body and endangers her life. The disease also can destroy a woman's self-image 
and her confidence. And it can strain a relationship to the breakup point. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is the woman who has cancer, her partner also faces some of its 
effects. He is afraid she will die. He's unsure how to respond to her range of 
emotions as she copes with her illness. He feels compelled to be stalwart and 
rock-ribbed, even when he is terrified. And, finally, he has to confront his 
feelings about the woman's body, transformed by surgery and chemotherapy.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's hell for her, but him too," said Ron Pepin, 65, of Anaheim. His wife, 
Ginny, 65, had a mastectomy in 1988 and reconstructive surgery a year later. 
"So many things happen to a woman where the guy doesn't understand what the 
hell to do. It's confusion, frustration and fear. It's a lack of knowledge and 
understanding. All that together, you've got a big problem." 
</P>
<P>
 That big problem led to the formation of a men's support group at the Breast 
Care Center in Orange, one in a growing number of facilities dedicated to 
helping couples. Two men whose wives had been treated there saw the benefits of 
the patient support group and asked if one could be started for men, said 
Barbara Scott, the center's patient educator.  
</P>
<P>
 The groups began getting together in the fall of 1992. Once a week, for a 
month or so, women whose cancer has been diagnosed in the past six months come 
to the center with their partners. The couples talk together for about a 
half-hour, then split into men's and women's sessions for an hour or more. Then 
the couples gather again to summarize the evening's discussions. When the 
formal sessions have concluded, couples can exchange phone numbers and continue 
to meet if they wish, Scott said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I see most is a fear of saying what you're feeling to that other 
person," Scott said. "The woman is so busy saying, 'I'm fine, fine, I'm going 
to be fine,' that she doesn't get to say, 'I'm really scared.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And the man is so busy saying, 'You'll be fine,' that he doesn't have the 
opportunity to say he's scared, too. Here they can come to a safe place and say 
their deepest feelings in a supportive environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. John West, surgical director of the center, said he urges men to go to the 
meetings.  
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't do it, I lean on them a little bit," he said. "I'm now 
convinced it's part of the healing. The males do better, the relationship does 
better, and maybe there's a survival-rate improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Although men are not known for pouring out their feelings to strangers, the 
group setting does work, said Craig Nattkemper, a psychologist who leads the 
men's sessions. Even if a man doesn't talk, he at least learns that other 
couples face the same difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 Men such as Pete Wesselink, 48, of Orange attend sessions to tell the group 
what they and their wives went through. Susan Wesselink, 47, had a bilateral 
mastectomy, rigorous chemotherapy and reconstructive surgery in 1990.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's so valuable for the guys," he said. "It gives them the chance to see how 
other people have dealt with this thing. If a guy asks, 'What did you do when 
her hair fell out?' or "How was your love life and did it bother you that your 
wife didn't have a breast?' you give them the benefit of your experience. 
That's been comforting to people." 
</P>
<P>
 The groups nearly always talk about what it means for a couple when a woman 
loses her breast to cancer. Women and men who have participated in the groups 
and talked to couples individually agree: It's more often the women who think 
losing a breast makes them less desirable.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost a universal response, that when the woman asks about what the 
loss of a breast means, the man says, 'Hey, it doesn't matter,' " Ron Pepin 
said. "Most women don't buy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Wesselink said he understands why that might be.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you watch TV or go to the movies, it's fairly obvious that it's the 
stereotype that's presented: Men are attracted to women because of their 
breasts," he said. "And it's not just breasts, but the bigger the better." 
</P>
<P>
 Wesselink said most men aren't as fixated as the media make them out to be.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a factor, but you learn to deal with it. You come to the realization, 
when you face a life-threatening illness, that there are more important 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Lynn Barlow's first surgery eight years ago, Rich Barlow, 51, has talked 
with some men who don't share that opinion.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like they're putting their wife on display . . . and to them, it 
would be like displaying a diamond: You wouldn't want to display one with a 
flaw," he said. "To me, it's very shallow. Those two pieces of flesh in the 
front of a lady have nothing to do with her brain or her heart." 
</P>
<P>
 But even when a man sincerely tells a woman that the loss of a breast doesn't 
matter, it can take a year or longer for a woman to believe it, Nattkemper 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 It was extremely difficult for Marie Lussenden, 58, of Anaheim. She had a 
breast removed in 1991 and resisted reconstructive surgery because she was "so 
petrified of dying" that she couldn't even think about it. In chemotherapy, she 
lost every strand of her body hair, including eyelashes.  
</P>
<P>
 "Seeing your body with only one breast is bad enough," she said. "Losing your 
hair is another psychological blow." 
</P>
<P>
 To top things off, she gained 40 pounds.  
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Dale, saw her through all of it. Her voice still catches as she 
praises him as "the biggest gift in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 "He would say wonderful things: 'I didn't marry you for your breast. I don't 
care if you weigh 500 pounds. I love the Marie inside.' But to me, I was 
hideous," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "All I could do was put my arms around her and hold her," said Dale, 50. 
"Sometimes we said nothing. I guess I treated her the way I would have wanted 
to be treated."  
</P>
<P>
 The couple still is coping with the changes cancer has wrought. Marie said 
that tamoxifen, the drug she takes to ward off the recurrence of breast cancer, 
has reduced her sex drive. And she fights the feeling that if she hates her 
body, her husband must, too.  
</P>
<P>
 "But things are getting better," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Not every relationship survives the buffeting that breast cancer inflicts. Ron 
Pepin knows of one recent situation in which a woman's fiance left her after 
hearing that her cancer had recurred. 
</P>
<P>
 In such situations, Pete Wesselink said, "you want to take the guy in the 
other room and knock his block off. But you can't force someone to care for 
someone. In my opinion, something was wrong before.'  
</P>
<P>
 Susan Wesselink agreed.  
</P>
<P>
 "They say that relationships that aren't strong have a difficult time 
surviving adversity," she said. "Ours was good to begin with, and one of the 
gifts of cancer was that it made it stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 She calls her husband "Prince Pete" for his approach to her illness. He shared 
nearly every step of treatment with her -- from reading her books on healing 
and attending all her chemotherapy sessions to shaving her head so she wouldn't 
have to watch the hair fall out in clumps every day.  
</P>
<P>
 "We both stood there in the bathroom, crying, cutting hair," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Ginny Pepin said she and Ron also found that her illness brought them closer.  
</P>
<P>
 "In 40 years of marriage, although you get along, you sort of take each other 
for granted," she said. "When this happens, it makes you realize how special 
life is and how much you appreciate one another." 
</P>
<P>
 The Barlows couldn't agree more. Lynn's illness tested their marriage, they 
said, but it also made them see the depth of their commitment. Lynn, 48, who 
had her other breast removed in 1987 as a precaution and then underwent 
reconstructive surgery for both breasts, finally realized that Rich meant it 
when he said he loved her for the heart inside her chest, not for what was in 
front of it.  
</P>
<P>
 "Aren't I lucky?" Lynn asked.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the lucky one," Rich replied. "You came around." Where to Get Help

 * Go often. You never know when a great deal might turn up.Stores receive 
donations throughout the week. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep an open mind. Look at everything in the store. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you can't alter it yourself, leave it on the rack. 
</P>
<P>
 * Buy clothes you would normally wear. Don't be persuaded by low prices. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look at the lining and stitching of each garment. Search for odors, holes, 
discoloration and snags. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be sure everything fits, because most stores have a no-return policy.

<P>
 By all accounts, Fullerton High School's recent Pow Wow dance (for the first 
time, a girl-ask-guy affair) was a success.The theme decorations for "A Night 
Under the Canopy" capitalized on a rain forest decor. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were a few glitches, according to the student newspaper, the 
Pleiades.  
</P>
<P>
 "The fog machine didn't work. It started smoking and smelling funny, and this 
tiny little stream of fog came out."

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; SECOND TIME AROUND; THERE'S NOTHING 
UNFASHIONABLE ABOUT SHOPPING AT THRIFT STORES. AND THE SAVINGS ARE SMART TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE PHAM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Michelle Pham is a junior at Trabuco 
Hills High School in Mission Viejo.

<P>
 Thrift stores are getting a second look from teen shoppers who not only like 
the reasonable prices but the fun of putting together unique outfits from the 
jam-packed racks. 
</P>
<P>
 For money-short teens, the price tags on clothes at department stores or 
specialty boutiques can bring on a chuckle of impossibility. At thrift stores, 
on the other hand, price tags are usually so low they bring on genuine smiles.  
</P>
<P>
 Experienced thrift shoppers know that just because someone else no longer 
wants an item doesn't mean it's past its prime. As a matter of fact, an item's 
true moment of glory may be yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrift shops can be a great source for like-new items as well as funky pieces 
from earlier decades -- preppy items from the '80s, bell-bottoms from the '70s, 
flower child dresses from the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get people from all walks of life. It's not considered unfashionable to 
shop at thrift stores anymore," said George Lucus, manager of the Lutheran 
Social Services Thrift Store in Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 By jumping into the scene and thoroughly combing the racks, nonconformists can 
create original outfits.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes new, brand name items pop up -- I recently picked up some new Levi's 
and Esprit slippers, each for $5.  
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills High School senior Jim Collins, a student director at the 
Greater Los Angeles Children's Theater, visits consignment stores regularly 
looking for items to fashion costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thrift stores are a good place for costumes because a lot of the clothes are 
old and cheap," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many thrift stores are run by charitable organizations that use the money from 
sales to help fund other activities. Donations to the shops come from 
everywhere and range from antiques to unopened packages. Most places sell 
clothes, purses, jewelry and shoes, as well as kitchen supplies, books, toys, 
furniture and cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't have a lot of money to spend, they are a great place to go," 
said Debbie Burch of Mission Viejo, who was shopping a resale store recently. 
Her friend found a wedding dress for $25. 
</P>

<P>
 The first wave of students has now undergone the newly revised Scholastic 
Aptitude Test, now named the Scholastic Assessment Test I (SAT I) and 
administered for the first time March 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley High School senior Marcus McGee thought it "definitely was 
easier." 
</P>
<P>
 But, McGee added, "As usual, the test contained words I had never heard before 
in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Emilie Scott, a junior at Capistrano Valley High, said, "The beginning parts 
of the math and English were too easy, and I was getting a bad feeling. The 
last part of the math was really hard, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Harder or not, the true test of SAT I's difficulty will be decided after the 
scores are received. Joslin Gemsch; junior, Capistrano Valley

CHECK IT OUT: OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; FRIENDSHIP AND OTHER BITES OF 
'REALITY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TARA BUDZYN and DANA LENETZ, Tara Budzyn and Dana Lenetz are students at 
Foothill High School in Santa Ana. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teen reviews of books, music, movies and other things of interest Tara: As we 
walked into the familiar Cinedome multiplex theater, I had to keep reminding 
Dana that "Reality Bites" is not a new snack food nor a vampire cult. It is, 
however, the hottest modern love, friendship and Big Gulp movie of the year. I 
should know: I have seen it four times. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana: Well, that is a sad commentary on your social life , Tara. Anyway, 
"Reality Bites" stars Winona Ryder, Ethan Hawke and Ben Stiller as three 
struggling 20-something, Generation-Xers trying to find their niche in society. 
</P>
<P>
 Tara: Gosh, Dana, you make it sound more like a bleach brand than a movie 
about an aspiring group of young people who listen to ' 70s music and search 
for their identity in ' 80s clothing. OK, maybe Generation X perfectly 
describes this cast of '90s yuppies, grungies and total nicotine addicts. Did 
everyone smoke in this movie? 
</P>
<P>
 Dana: I think I got asthma watching this movie. Let me catch my breath! 
</P>
<P>
 Tara: Nice segue, Dana! 
</P>
<P>
 Dana: Thanks, I liked it. The film focuses on Ryder's character, Lelaina, and 
her pursuit of the American Dream/Perfect Career. Stuck in a low-paying job as 
an intern for a low-budget talk-show host, Lelaina captures the trials and 
tribulations of her friends on video camera in hopes of turning these home 
movies into a documentary about life after college. Personally, I think that 
this is one of Ryder's strongest roles, because she perfectly captures the 
emotions that a college graduate must experience as she desperately searches 
for a steady job in today's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Tara: Speaking of strong and steady, send me a copy of the tape of Ethan 
Hawke. Can we say "marry me"? His performance as Troy Dyer, the 
philosopher/musician who is too cool for school, melted the butter on my 
popcorn each time I saw the film. He is intense yet aloof, deep yet emotionally 
blocked. And he has the sexiest eyebrows I have ever seen! For the guys reading 
this, I would like to mention that Ryder has some fine attributes as well. Her 
cute little nose looks exactly like Dana's. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana: Now that you mention look-alikes, Tara, you bear a striking resemblance 
to Stiller, who makes his directorial debut. Stiller also delivers a phenomenal 
performance as Michael Grates, the uptown, cellular phone-toting, Armani suit 
yuppie who falls in love with Lelaina after she destroys his car and favorite 
collector's item -- a Planet of the Apes statue. Stiller's character, which is 
the antithesis of Hawke's, adds to the witty repartee between Lelaina and Troy 
and also fans the sexual fires between the two friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Tara: The varied types of cinematography also add a unique flare to the film. 
Portions of the movie are revealed through the viewfinder of Lelaina's video 
camera, which made me feel as if I were participating in the creation of the 
documentary. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana: Don't forget to mention the on-fire soundtrack that includes such 
artists as Lenny Kravitz, the Indians, Dinosaur Jr., World Party and even a 
debut song by Hawke. The diversity of the songs symbolizes the lost identity of 
the characters; it includes love songs, a rap song, reggae songs and the 1970s 
classic "My Sharona." 
</P>
<P>
 Tara: Dana, you are on fire with that hilarious comparison between Stiller and 
myself. And that is exactly what this film is, the pinnacle of sophisticated 
humor for a generation who cannot help but laugh at themselves. Kids, watch it 
and laugh at your parents, who pretend they get the jokes. Overall, we say 
"Reality Bites" is fun for the entire family.

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; MY TURN; TUNE IN, AMERICA: VIOLENCE CAN'T BE 
UNPLUGGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SID PADMANABHA, Sid Padmanabha is a senior at Troy High School in Fullerton. 
This article first appeared in the student newspaper, the Oracle. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attributing the amount of violence seen on television to the prevalence of 
violence in society, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno and a panel of congressmen recently 
coerced the four major television networks into labeling violent television 
programs with a parental discretion warning. 
</P>
<P>
 With millions of handguns in circulation and, according to the FBI, a violent 
crime occurring every 20 seconds, Reno is correct that the United States must 
crack down on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 However, these lawmakers are looking in the wrong direction if they think that 
curbing television's imaginary violence will eradicate the actual violence that 
is erupting in our schools and on our streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence linking violence on television to actual crime is doubtful at best. 
According to a recent study done by the University of Pennsylvania, the number 
of crimes viewed per hour on television has declined 41% from 1973 to 1992, 
although crime has risen steadily. 
</P>
<P>
 This uproar comes at a time when, ironically, the prime-time television lineup 
is tamer than usual. As opposed to five years ago when prime time was dominated 
by violent, action-oriented shows such as "Hill Street Blues," "Miami Vice" and 
"Hunter," today's prime time offers comedies such as "Roseanne," "Northern 
Exposure" and "Seinfeld." 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, it is unlikely these warnings will prevent children or teen-agers 
from watching violent programming. According to the American Psychology Assn., 
children often end up watching 19,000 hours of television by the time they 
graduate from high school and have little, if any, adult supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the parental advisories will produce the opposite of the intended 
effect, actually drawing some teens to view the violent programming as the R 
film rating has done for some movies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short term, the parental labeling may make a lot of people happy: The 
television producers continue to broadcast violence preceded by a brief 
warning; lawmakers receive kudos for fighting crime, and some teens may find 
the TV violence they crave flagged by an introductory warning. 
</P>
<P>
 With these warnings, Washington is favoring political expediency over actual 
reform by offering a quick, painless but ineffective fix to the problem of 
rising crime. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the meantime, every 20 seconds, a violent crime occurs somewhere in the 
United States.

ELECTIONS THAT ARE POLLS APART; RACE HEATS UP IN BEVERLY HILLS, GROWTH ISSUE 
DOMINATES IN MALIBU, IT'S QUIET IN WEST HOLLYWOOD AND A SPIRITED CONTEST IN 
CULVER CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ken Ellingwood, This story was reported by G. Jeanette Avent, Carol 
Chastang, Ken Ellingwood and Kathleen Kelleher. It was written by Ellingwood. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Voters go to the polls in four Westside cities Tuesday to settle municipal 
races ranging from low-key to loud. 
</P>
<P>
 Culminating a quiet campaign, progressive West Hollywood could elect its first 
gay City Council majority in eight years. Malibu council candidates, meanwhile, 
have been debating -- for the most part politely -- how to retain what's left 
of that city's pastoral calm. 
</P>
<P>
 But in crime-conscious Beverly Hills, a former New York prosecutor has drawn 
fire from a police union as he tries to hold his council seat. And in Culver 
City, an unexpectedly spirited city clerk's race centers on just how 
professional -- and well-paid -- the clerk's job should be. Beverly Hills 
</P>
<P>
 The most in-your-face campaign is taking place in Beverly Hills, where 
incumbent Councilman Robert K. Tanenbaum, the top vote-getter in two previous 
elections, is trying to stave off what may be his first serious challenge. The 
threats come from a committee whose sole purpose is to defeat him and from the 
city's police union. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanenbaum, armed with $41,000 in campaign funds and an eight-year track 
record, is one of eight candidates competing for two seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Although few expect Tanenbaum to fall, he faces a determined group of 
detractors who previously tried to unseat him as president of the board of 
directors of the Beverly Hills Family Y. Now they hope to oust him from his 
council seat. The group had raised $6,100 for the effort -- most of it from 
outgoing Mayor Maxwell Salter. 
</P>
<P>
 Salter, who declined to seek a third term, has accused Tanenbaum, a lawyer, of 
glossing over a deficit at the Y, which since 1987 has received about $226,000 
in city grants. Tanenbaum has responded that charities have been very hard-hit 
by the recession and called it "almost miraculous" that the Y even stayed open. 
</P>
<P>
 Unwilling to let the issue rest until June, when the city reviews its grants 
to community groups, some former Y members and current board member Roger Cowan 
formed a campaign committee going beyond the Y issue to oppose Tanenbaum's 
council bid. Cowan's wife, Debra, who is the group's treasurer, says: "The Y 
was simply a galvanizing issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The group mailed out a letter last week from Beverly Hills Police Officers 
Assn. President Joseph Chirillo that was notable not so much for its 
endorsement of candidates MeraLee Goldman and Les Bronte as for its strong 
denunciation of Tanenbaum. 
</P>
<P>
 The union, which represents the city's 128 police officers and usually backs 
incumbents, faults Tanenbaum for representing Sylvester Stallone after the 
actor became the subject of a Beverly Hills police investigation in April, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallone had been accused in West Hollywood of assaulting a photographer 
during a car chase that began in West Hollywood and ended in Beverly Hills, but 
the Los Angeles County district attorney never filed charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanenbaum denies any impropriety, saying he obtained an opinion from the 
Beverly Hills city attorney assuring him that it would not be a conflict of 
interest to represent Stallone while on the council. Tanenbaum says that he is 
dismayed that "during the heat of a political campaign, the (association) sees 
fit to play politics with people's lives and misrepresent past events to fit 
political agendas." 
</P>
<P>
 The former prosecutor has also angered the police union for campaign remarks 
that the union says belittled the department. Tanenbaum, the only candidate who 
opposes hiring more police, urged that the city "not add more police desk 
jockeys in suits," suggesting instead that the department put more of its 
existing personnel on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanenbaum is so controversial that the other candidates have trouble getting 
any attention. However, Goldman, a former planning commissioner, Bronte, a 
former Chamber of Commerce president, and Alan Robert Block, a city schools' 
activist, have all raised sums of money comparable to the $41,432 raised by 
Tanenbaum. They and the rest of the candidates in the race -- Mary Levin 
Cutler, Bernard J. Hecht, Trisha Roth and Herm Shultz -- all have agreed not to 
exceed a $60,000 limit set by the League of Women Voters. Malibu

<P>
 In Malibu, where two City Council seats are being contested, incumbents Walt 
Keller and John Harlow face four challengers in a decidedly tame campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout, the talk has been of how to control growth -- a topic as dominant 
now as in the 1991 cityhood election and 1992 council race. Nearly every public 
forum has been dominated by debate of the draft general plan, the final version 
of which will guide the city's overall development and will be presented for 
public comment in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Keller, who received the most votes in Malibu's 1991 cityhood election, and 
challenger Tom Hasse are running on a slow-growth platform and have been 
endorsed by Mayor Carolyn Van Horn and anti-growth activists. They believe the 
draft general plan provides adequate -- and not overly restrictive -- 
restraints on the ability of single-family homeowners to develop their 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Harlow and challengers Jeff Jennings, both of whom were endorsed 
by Supervisor Ed Edelman along with Keller, fear that the draft plan is far too 
restrictive to single-family homeowners -- and may, they say, adversely affect 
property values. Candidates Louis Ragsdale and Robert Stratman have voiced the 
same concerns over the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear how much weight such objections would carry on the five-member 
council, however, because the three council members not up for election -- Van 
Horn, Mayor Pro Tem Jeff Kramer and Joann House appear to favor a more 
restrictive general plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is scheduled to adopt a general plan in November. Public hearings 
on the draft plan are scheduled to start next month. Culver City 
</P>
<P>
 In Culver City, voters will elect two candidates to the City Council, but the 
real drama has been in the race for the city clerk's post. The contest has 
pitted a longtime incumbent against an activist seeking his first elected 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 The key issue is pay. Incumbent Clerk Pauline Dolce wants to keep her 
$75,000-a-year salary. Her opponent, Tom Crunk, supports a recent City Council 
decision to slash the salary to $732 a month, or about $9,000 a year. The 
council action would take effect in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Crunk, the first person to challenge Dolce in her 16-year tenure, says he 
would not wait until 1996 for the pay cut. He compares the clerk position to 
that of a part-time elected official, and considers the $75,000 salary 
unreasonably high. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolce says the clerk's job requires a full-time professional to oversee 
elections, prepare meeting agendas, supervise the city's accounting division 
and pay the city's bills. A separate ballot measure before Culver City voters 
would shift accounting duties to the city treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 The council race, meanwhile, centers on development issues. 
</P>
<P>
 While incumbent Mike Balkman points to progress in major downtown 
redevelopment, the challengers have said that the city is not doing enough to 
encourage business. Two of the candidates -- Jim Hilfenhaus and Richard Marcus 
-- say Balkman has broken his promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Balkman) had said he would do his best to lower taxes," Marcus said. "But he 
proposed an 11% utility tax on cellular phones. . . . How do you encourage 
business by levying one more tax?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hilfenhaus criticized the council's approval of the controversial Marina Place 
retail mall, an 18-acre lot that has yet to be developed. Hilfenhaus said he 
would hold more public meetings to solicit residents' opinions of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenger Ed Wolkowitz, a member of the Planning Commission, has attacked a 
proposal to have the city take over Southern California Edison's Culver City 
operations. Such actions, he said, give the city a bad reputation in business 
circles. West Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates are not talking about what might be the most interesting 
feature of an otherwise lackluster West Hollywood City Council race. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, whose population is about one-third gay and lesbian, would have a 
gay council majority with a sweep of the three seats available. Gays have not 
dominated the council since 1986. Incumbent John Heilman, who is seeking 
reelection, is the council's only openly gay member. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine of the 10 active candidates are gay, but there has been almost no talk of 
gay and lesbian issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 With so many gay candidates, there is little political gain in emphasizing gay 
issues. A local cause with strong appeal to many gay voters -- the creation of 
a city police force -- is opposed by most of the council candidates. Candidates 
still worry about alienating heterosexual voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no such thing as a gay and lesbian parking problem," says Steve 
Martin, a gay rights activist and rent commissioner who lost his last council 
bid in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Most candidates end the race as they began -- emphasizing public safety above 
all other issues. The only other incumbent, Sal Guarriello, has played up his 
role as a fiscal watchdog. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's key political endorsement, from the renters rights group Coalition 
for Economic Survival, went to Heilman and running mate Jeff Richmond, who 
heads the Planning Commission. Even though three seats are up for election, the 
group did not endorse a third candidate. Campaign Cash
