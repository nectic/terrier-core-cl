GEORGE RAMOS: THE LIMITED VISION OF PREJUDICE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The bright, happy kids at Humphreys Avenue School in East L.A. helped me keep 
a promise last Tuesday. I had vowed that I would do whatever I could to 
convince inner-city kids that they can be anything they want to be. 
</P>
<P>
 They aren't just destined to be day laborers, factory workers or, in my case, 
an auto mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
 I made that promise because of something I was told a long time ago when I was 
a fourth-grader at Hammel Street School, which isn't all that far from 
Humphreys. A teacher, who thought he was steering me toward a worthwhile 
career, was giving me some advice. Knowing that my dad was a factory worker in 
a tire plant, he told me: 
</P>
<P>
 "Mexicans are really good at fixing cars, but not much else. Stay out of jail. 
Forget other jobs. Just fix cars, don't steal them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'll never forget his words. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, I was upset because I took his observation to mean that I 
couldn't be like Davy Crockett, the TV hero of the 1950s that most Chicano kids 
at Hammel idolized. As the popular tune of the day noted, this guy must have 
really been something if he could wrestle a bear when he was only 3. 
</P>
<P>
 I eventually grew out of my Davy Crockett T-shirt and my fascination with him. 
He was, after all, an illegal immigrant who went to Texas to fight Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years after Hammel, I have been trying to prove that teacher wrong. He 
had prejudged us, sold us short. He had consigned kids like me to the bottom of 
the barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 I wasn't going to let him get away with that. I was going to talk to as many 
kids as I could. I'd tell them about Davy Crockett. I'd tell them about that 
teacher. And I'd tell them about my job at the L.A. Times. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the invitation came to visit Humphreys, I happily accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphreys is a lot like Hammel. It's in a working-class neighborhood where 
Spanish, tortillerias and a noisy Long Beach Freeway are permanent fixtures. 
The student body is overwhelmingly Latino -- 99.96% -- but the kids' dreams are 
All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials decided to hold a career day for the fourth-, fifth- and 
sixth-graders as a novel approach to celebrating Cinco de Mayo. It's a good way 
to "instill pride and respect for our children," Principal Lydia Canales said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those invited were an attorney, a firefighter, an airline reservation 
agent, two Hughes engineers, a court stenographer, the director of an anti-drug 
program and a banker. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't long before I talked about Hammel and that teacher. The third- and 
fourth-graders in Room 18 got me started. 
</P>
<P>
 "What were your dreams as a boy?" one shy girl asked in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to be a cowboy," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids gave me a blank stare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does anyone here know about cars?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 No one raised a hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids listened as I told them they had talents and dreams no one could take 
away from them. They didn't seem to react. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many of you speak Spanish?" I asked in English. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the 20 or so kids in the room raised a hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you realize there are more Spanish-speakers in this room than there are in 
the newsroom of the L.A. Times?" 
</P>
<P>
 Two little girls in the front of the room looked incredulously at me, as if to 
say, "You're kidding, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You have the tools to be reporters," I said. "You read. You write. You ask 
questions. You're curious. And, you speak Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
 The kids seemed to get the point. They smiled and joked with each other. They 
seemed to sit up straighter and talk with more self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Room 18, however, needs to work on what is news. "Write that Humphreys is 
beautiful," the youngsters pleaded. 
</P>
<P>
 "That ain't news," the cynical Hammel kid barked. 
</P>
<P>
 " Somos bonitos . We are beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 The reactions were the same in Rooms 8, 10, 46, 47 and 48. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After The Times won a Pulitzer Prize last year for its coverage of the L.A. 
riots, I got a call from that Hammel teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 He complimented me, remembering that I'd also been involved in another 
Pulitzer awarded to The Times, this one back in 1984 for a lengthy series about 
Latinos living in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 I replied with the required "thanks," but couldn't help but tell him of the 
anger inside me, of why I wasn't a mechanic and of my promise to talk to 
students today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did what I thought was right," he said finally, "and I'd do it again. Some 
people are meant to do certain things. There aren't enough kids like you out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 I haven't called him since then because I'm still angry at him. But after my 
day at Humphreys, I went looking for his number. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to tell him what Room 18 says.

 Last week Los Angeles police voted down the city's contract offer . Afterward 
officers shared their thoughts on the city's offer and their two-year period 
without a contract.  
</P>
<P>
 JOSEPH GRYDER 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic accident investigator, South Traffic Division 
</P>
<P>
 I told the (City) Council this contract is an insult to my intelligence and my 
integrity. I've worked for two years without a contract. We haven't had a 
contract where we even met cost of living since the Olympics. I'm losing buying 
power. My family is what's at risk. I'm working in a city that's growing in a 
department that's decreasing in size. I'm doing the work of two policemen for 
the pay of about two-thirds of a policeman. 
</P>
<P>
 They want me to take care of the public and I want to do that. That's why I 
came on the job. I'm very unhappy. No, heck, I'm mad. I'm angry. The 
politicians we ask to provide our leadership are not providing that. I'm a lead 
delegate, a shop steward for about 100 men and women. When I listen to them, 
the very least we ought to be talking about is (retroactive pay and maintaining 
current) benefits. The city fathers tell us we're the top Police Department in 
the nation. We're not even on parity with with other police departments in 
Southern California. GARY MacNAMARA 
</P>
<P>
 Sergeant, office of operations 
</P>
<P>
 I thought it (the contract) was about as good as we could get considering 
where we came from; but I understand the frustration of the other members.  
</P>
<P>
 What can the City Council do now? They've got to recognize that they've got a 
problem, a crisis they're going to have to deal with. They've gotten some bad 
advice -- that if you stall the cops, it'll work out. That's not the case. 
We're generally looking to maintain our standard of living. We realize (if) you 
want to do the vacation, put your kids in private school and everything else, 
you take the second jobs or your wife works. We're generally recruited from 
blue-collar occupations. But we have a lot of college-educated guys. I've got a 
Masters with a specialty in personnel. TED HUNT 
</P>
<P>
 Officer, training division 
</P>
<P>
 I love my department and people are leaving because of the salary and working 
conditions. Some police cars (for example) have over 150,000 miles on them 
while the brass drives around in brand new ones. In my own division there are 
so few cars that if I need to do something I either have to use my personal car 
or I don't do it because it's so difficult to get a car.  
</P>
<P>
 Training is very expensive because (it isn't) just classroom experience. It's 
classroom experience plus practical application. What should alarm taxpayers is 
that, because of salary and benefits, LAPD is becoming the training ground for 
law enforcement. So many qualified people are not staying those extra 
productive years or are leaving early because their family comes first. By 
going someplace else they don't have to commute so far, they get paid more and 
they get equipment that works. 
</P>
<P>
 I give my heart and soul to the department. Money certainly is the issue; but 
beyond the money is the fact that it's a symbol of respect for the things I do. 
And I know I give it my all -- me, my partners and the students I teach. 
BARBARA L. CARRANZA 
</P>
<P>
 Officer, detective headquarters 
</P>
<P>
 The contract was inadequate. Unfortunately, I've been on the negotiating team 
for two years and it's been a long, frustrating process. It didn't include a 
patrol bonus, which I understand would have divided the membership a bit; but 
the patrol officers deserve that -- a bonus into their pension base.  
</P>
<P>
 Both the City Council and the mayor need to get their priorities straight. 
They need to treat officers fairly, stop dividing the membership and trying to 
break the union. They also need to stop worrying about the number of officers 
they're striving for and worry more about the quality of, and how they're 
treating, the officers they currently have. LEE D. PRENTISS 
</P>
<P>
 Detective, Rampart Division 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty eight years and this is the most disgusting I've ever seen. I voted no 
as I walked in because the contract was unacceptable to me and to the officers 
who'd retired in the last two years because they are not getting retroactive 
pay they should have got. It's an insult to every officer coming up through the 
ranks because the city will use this as "past practice" -- something they've 
thrown at us for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The politicians have put us into this position. Twenty years ago when (Tom) 
Bradley became mayor, we represented 52% of the city budget. We now represent 
32%. We've gone 20 years without even cash overtime and now they're throwing 
cash overtime at us saying, "Here's all this money. Work! Work! Work!" My guys 
have already been worn out working. If they have all this overtime money they 
should have put it in the budget.  
</P>
<P>
 Unless there is binding arbitration or a contract, I don't think many Los 
Angeles police officers are going to be available for the World Cup.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: CONVERSATION WITH 
BARRY J. NIDORF; 'PARENTS MUST SHOW CHILDREN THAT MISBEHAVIOR IS NOT PERMITTED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Interviewed by Jill Stewart. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barry J. Nidorf, chief probation officer for Los Angeles County, recently 
studied the delinquent children who enter his system and found that just 16% 
cause a staggering two-thirds of his department's long-term costs. Nidorf says 
these serious repeat offenders, who generally go on to become society's career 
criminals, are a small and easily identifiable group whose numbers could be 
significantly reduced. He was interviewed by Jill Stewart.  
</P>
<P>
 Question: Are you proposing a new government agency to tackle the problem of 
high-risk kids who become society's career criminals? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, we're seeking funding for a pilot program that would use a consortium 
of people from leading government agencies and community groups who would 
analyze each child's case and refer the child to help at agencies that already 
exist. This individual assessment of the child and family would be followed by 
some sort of guarantee of treatment. We hope to get funding from the federal 
crime bill and from charitable foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why are kids changing and becoming a major criminal force, when it used to 
be rare for a child to commit serious crime? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It didn't happen overnight, but the institutions that brought up kids, from 
parents to churches to schools to government welfare, have all deteriorated. 
Unfortunately, the era in which women left the home and entered the work force 
can be directly tied to the time when society began to lose control over kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Explain how your early prevention program for little children would work. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Prevention means intervention. We are proposing a new approach to provide 
kids what they are lacking, meaning recreation, remedial training for learning 
deficiencies, socialization skills, exposure to the beaches, mountains, all the 
things kids used to do 20 years ago. It's a matter of showing that someone 
cares about a kid, instead of the approach now, which is that society says it 
cares, but just doesn't have the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Since small children haven't committed crimes yet, how do you know which 
grade school and preschool kids to target? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Their characteristics are all the same. They have school problems, poor 
peer relationships, drug or alcohol abuse in the family and sometimes 
mistreatment by parents. If we have a file on a kid that shows these things, we 
can commit resources before they commit their first delinquent act. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What can parents do if their child seems headed for trouble? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Don't throw up your hands. The child needs a face-to-face talk. Many 
agencies can help parents, and parents must act to show children that 
consequences will occur and misbehavior is not permitted. Of course, no amount 
of talking is going to change the fact of a 14-year-old charged with murder. 
But in preschool and grade school we can have a tremendous effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: According to the Rand Corp., juvenile delinquents have moved beyond 
low-level crimes like joy-riding or shoplifting because now kids often have 
guns, and guns mean that far more serious crimes will be committed.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Kids have no fear of firearms like adults do, and no understanding 
whatsoever of consequences. Kids who are well into our detention system talk 
about killing three or four people without any feeling because they saw 
somebody shot on TV who just got up and walked away. Add to that the incredible 
availability of guns now, compared to 20 years ago, and you have kids who don't 
think twice before they use a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Could curfew work as a society-wide intervention program? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Curfew is an important tool because when kids are unsupervised on the 
streets, they get in trouble. Not even the best parents can control a kid if 
they aren't around to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Since the "three strikes and you're out" law passed, statistics have 
emerged showing that surprisingly few people over the age of 30 commit serious 
crimes, which suggests that it's pointless to imprison people into old age. So 
what should society do? 
</P>
<P>
 A: That's true, but you can't just say let them outgrow it, because up to age 
30, young people cause so much damage it's intolerable. If you intervene with 
that 12-year-old, odds are good you won't need to imprison him later.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TODAY'S TOPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of the so-called "Generation X" have one thing in common, say the 
experts who study such matters: They don't like to be lumped together as a 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, generations are repeatedly defined by their transitional twenties: the 
Beats of the '50s, the Flower Children of the '60s, the Me Generation of the 
'70s and the Greed Generation of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 No one really knows how to define the age range of Generation X, some of whom 
are younger than 20. But, according to a 1991 novel by Douglas Coupland, they 
are disillusioned, alienated and unfocused. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Youth Opinion, Kristen Perry agrees with that description and 
berates her fellow Generation X-ers for their lack of passion, hope and faith 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 But who are these young people? Is life really that bleak for the generation 
that will reach adulthood in the last decade of this century? 
</P>
<P>
 "They tend to be more pessimistic, more cynical and less trusting of 
institutions than prior generations," says David Stewart, professor of 
marketing at USC. "But there is no evidence to suggest that we've seen a 
massive increase in suicide rates or drug usage as a result of those 
attitudes." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Ronald Goodstein, assistant professor of marketing at UCLA's Anderson 
School of Management, "They're anti-niche. They don't want to be targeted by 
marketing groups. They say 'I'm different, I don't want to be traditional, I'm 
unique.' The irony is that they're all saying the same thing, which gives the 
group commonality." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, like every generation before them, today's young adults are facing a 
unique set of circumstances that give their generation its character. For 
Generation X, the experts say, the economy and the job market are the defining 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Downsizing has become a permanent part of American business," says Marshall 
Nickles, associate professor of economics at Pepperdine University. "Businesses 
are getting along with fewer layers of management, which makes it difficult for 
youngsters to find work." 
</P>
<P>
 "Economic conditions make it harder for young people to move out of their 
parents home," adds Clarence Hibbs, professor of psychology at Pepperdine.  
</P>
<P>
 Generation X may take longer to, as Hibbs says, "accomplish the three tasks of 
unattached young adults -- coming to terms with their family of origin, 
establishing themselves in work and establishing relationships with other 
people." But, few expect Generation X to be a truly lost generation. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, some experts are downright optimistic about the outlook for this 
group -- 40 million of whom are between age 20 and 29, according to the 1991 
census. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 76 million baby boomers," Stewart says. "As they begin to move out 
of the way, Generation X will command premium jobs."  
</P>
<P>
 Adds Goodstein, "This is not a lost generation, as the 'X' implies. They are 
perfectly identifiable, reachable and substantial in size. They have a 
reputation for being slackers -- people who don't work hard. They work as hard 
as anybody during work hours. Then they're back outside doing things and 
accumulating experiences."

 Efforts to support families with children who are troubled or gifted sometimes 
overlook families with children who are good learners with average school 
performances and no behavioral problems. USC launched a program for these 
families in 1991 as part of its Neighborhood Academic Initiative designed to 
offer services to the mostly working-class people who live close to the campus. 
Each year the university selects 60 seventh-graders with "C" averages from two 
nearby schools to enter its six-year Pre-College Enrichment Academy. The reward 
for graduating? A full four-year scholarship to USC. 
</P>
<P>
 The program asks a lot from its participants. Students, referred to as Academy 
Scholars, attend classes at their schools and go to USC each weekday and 
Saturday for more than 14 hours of additional college prep courses, tutoring 
and enrichment activities. Parents must participate in workshops and seminars 
to bolster the family's commitment toward learning. Professional counseling 
helps everyone cope with the program's demands and other issues or distractions 
that come up at the university, junior high school, home or in the community. 
About a quarter of those accepted to the program leave or are asked to leave 
because of attitude problems, but no student has ever left for academic 
reasons. The first scholars admitted to the program are expected to enroll at 
USC in 1997. WHAT PARENTS DO 
</P>
<P>
 Sign a contract and take a pledge to fulfill their responsibilities to the 
academy and the academic initiative 
</P>
<P>
 Ensure that their children study at least three hours every evening 
</P>
<P>
 Agree to notify academy staff of troubles their child has at home, school or 
in the community, including changes in behavior or attitude 
</P>
<P>
 Participate in 24 Saturday family development sessions each year to discuss 
subjects like family conflict resolution, employment skills enhancement and 
cultural awareness 
</P>
<P>
 Attend all academy-sponsored special activities and help with at least one 
program each year WHAT ACADEMY SCHOLARS DO 
</P>
<P>
 Maintain at least "C" averages and grade level proficiency in reading, writing 
and speaking English 
</P>
<P>
 Attend at least 90% of their classes and arrive at school on time 
</P>
<P>
 Have no drug, gang or criminal involvement 
</P>
<P>
 Sign a contract and take a pledge to fulfill their academy responsibilities 
and to follow a scholar code of ethics HOW WELL THEY'VE DONE 
</P>
<P>
 These scores from the 1992-93 California Test of Basic Skills compare 
Neighborhood Academic Initiative Scholars, gifted students and overall averages

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: COMMUNITY ESSAY; 
DREAM OF BECOMING CITIZEN MUST BE PROTECTED BY ALL; AMERICA MUST AVOID THE 
NIGHTMARE OF A POLARIZED NATION PITTING NATIVE-BORN RESIDENTS AGAINST 
IMMIGRANTS.

 Angela Lee's last dream was to become a U.S. citizen. Diagnosed with terminal 
liver cancer, the 60-year-old Korean immigrant was determined to die an 
American. So as her college-educated daughter pushed the emaciated 75-pound 
grandmother in her shiny wheelchair through a crowded aisle of the Los Angeles 
district office of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, admiring 
glances and nods of understanding pervaded the room in which immigrants must 
pass a test for U.S. citizenship. Such occasions may be multiplied many times 
if a new campaign is implemented this year by the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Early this year, INS Commissioner Doris Meissner announced that the federal 
government will allocate $30 million in fiscal year 1995 in hopes of 
facilitating the citizenship dreams of about 8 million lawful residents who 
have come to the United States since 1965, especially the 3 million who began 
receiving amnesty in 1988. Though too small a portion of the overall INS 
budget, the campaign will nevertheless establish a hot line to disseminate 
information about applying for citizenship, work with community groups and 
schools to promote citizenship and language proficiency and beef up staff to 
handle applications more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a campaign comes at a critical juncture in our nation's history. 
Immigrants are too often portrayed as taking but not giving back to their 
adopted country. They are often seen as separate and distinct from the social 
fabric of the United States. This social alienation combined with fears about 
immigrants' impact on the economy have led to drastic proposals to curtail 
immigration and limit citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 A successful naturalization drive would help to counteract misinformed 
anti-immigrant attitudes. According to Meissner, when Americans see immigrants 
adopting common values, they become reassured. She has a point. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most Americans realize that denial of naturalization rights has 
historically been used to discriminate against Asians, Latinos and others, many 
have not been convinced that constitutional protections of citizenship should 
be upheld. The many economic studies showing the net benefit of immigration 
have also not been persuasive enough to counteract the belief that immigrants 
take more than they give. 
</P>
<P>
 A highly visible naturalization campaign would demonstrate how immigrants are 
productive citizens. Immigrants who want to become citizens do in fact 
undertake significant responsibilities in the citizenship process; they must 
learn to read, write and speak basic English to pass the citizenship test and 
they must pass a history exam that includes 100 questions that range from 
naming the colors of the U.S. flag to reciting the name of the President who 
was the first commander in chief of the U.S. military. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrants like Angela Lee must certify that they have paid their taxes, that 
they will serve in the military in a time of war and that they will perform 
civilian duties during times of national emergency. Applicants are 
fingerprinted to determine any arrests in their background. They can be 
rejected for citizenship if they have failed to pay child support, if they do 
not register for the Selective Service, or if they have unlawfully accepted 
government benefits.  
</P>
<P>
 Newly naturalized citizens are providing the fundamental building block of our 
democracy by participating in the political process. In the west San Gabriel 
Valley, for example, new citizens are among increasing numbers of Asian 
American political candidates.  
</P>
<P>
 In running for local offices, immigrants join the community in seeking 
solutions to problems facing society. Citizens and non-citizens alike can 
benefit from the lessons of many immigrant families whose drive for educational 
achievement and excellence needs to be shared with all. 
</P>
<P>
 But the INS citizenship campaign will not succeed unless Commissioner Meissner 
targets the agency itself. The Los Angeles INS office, for example, is so 
understaffed that it takes up to nine or 10 months for prospective citizens to 
schedule an interview. But with thousands of new applicants expected to apply 
as a result of the Clinton citizenship drive, fundamental changes will be 
required that go beyond simply adding personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic filing of applications, waiving interviews for selected qualified 
applicants and having INS personnel visit schools, community organizations and 
work sites to conduct mass exams would all be steps in the right direction. 
Allowing permanent residents to apply after three years instead of the current 
five must also be given serious consideration. Creating citizenship outreach 
offices in partnership with community organizations can help naturalize large 
numbers of applicants. Keeping the existing filing fee of $90 instead of 
increasing the amount to $195, as some have proposed, would also encourage 
rather than discourage potential applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian Americans, Latinos and other immigrant groups must join Meissner in 
helping local communities to streamline procedures, and to promote and expand 
the naturalization program. But the most daunting task of all is to impart to 
mainstream America the idea that becoming an American is a dream all of us must 
protect if we are to avoid the nightmare of an increasingly polarized country 
divided by debates over birthright.

 The high school graduation ceremony has just ended. Excitement and jubilation 
fill the air. Cameras flash as parents and students proudly record the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan, who is white, Maria, a Latina, and Pau, a Chinese student, have become 
close friends during their school years and want to mark this moment of 
friendship and achievement. They gather together to take a picture, but as soon 
as Maria steps in between Alan and Pau, Pau's parents shout, "No!" 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 Many traditional Chinese people believe an uneven number of people in a 
photograph brings bad luck. To have three people is of greater consequence as 
they believe the person in the middle will die. 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction of Pau's parents bewildered Alan and Maria, but after Pau 
explained their belief, Maria apologized and stepped out of the picture. Pau's 
parents felt relieved and happy. Although this belief seemed strange to them, 
Maria and Alan accepted it out of respect for their friend. As a result, they 
took turns stepping in and out of the shot until they each had pictures with 
one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Relating even or uneven numbers with death is also seen elsewhere. Armenians 
from Yerevan believe that giving an even number of flowers brings bad luck 
because even numbers are linked with death and funeral rituals that require an 
even number of candles and flowers. Consequently, on happy occasions, Armenians 
only give an uneven number of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rule: Different cultures associate bad luck and death with specific numbers or 
number sequences.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TESTIMONY; ONE 
PERSON'S STORY ABOUT TEACHING; 'EVERY STUDENT HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER' 
</P>

<P>
 Dilip Saxena was born in Washington, D.C., where his father, a diplomat from 
India, was stationed. The family soon returned to India where Saxena received a 
Master's degree in Literature. He later returned to the United States and has 
taught sixth grade in Riverside County's Corona-Norco Unified School District 
for the past eight years. This year he received the Bravo award from the L.A. 
Music Center for incorporating the fine arts and performing arts into his 
curriculum.  
</P>
<P>
 I believe that every student has something to offer and that the arts are a 
really good avenue to discover that something. Once we find it, they can 
develop self-confidence and project it into other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 There are so many different types of students. I have one student who knows no 
English and yet can participate in our drama productions. I have another from 
Japan who is newly arrived. Students who come from broken homes or have a nasty 
atmosphere at home are able to get away from that and express themselves 
through art rather than be bottled up and expected to memorize all of this 
information that doesn't really mean very much to them.  
</P>
<P>
 Art helps them get in touch with themselves. A lot of times after having done 
a performance, even participating in a tiny little part, they will come and 
open up to you about various things they normally wouldn't do. They come to 
realize that they can communicate to everybody there and to me and they end up 
feeling a little closer to me.  
</P>
<P>
 Our district is very innovative and encourages things like that. Not only does 
the administration let us do what we want, but they support us financially and 
there's a lot of involvement of the PTA in our school and the community. Every 
time we put on one of these productions we invite the neighboring schools. So 
it becomes a pretty big thing and doesn't get limited to something that you're 
doing just in your classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody realizes the variety of information that's being conveyed to the 
students. For example, when we do plays, one of the most important things is 
doing light and sound. Instead of just opening a book and asking what are the 
theories behind light and sound they actually learn how sound travels. 
</P>
<P>
 They know why they are learning -- it's not just because it's in the book but 
because they actually can use this information. The emphasis is on what you can 
do with your education rather then learn it and get an A and that's it. 
</P>
<P>
 Grading is not a problem. Cooperative learning is pretty big in our district. 
The kids do presentations and we have an oral language grade in our report card 
and that is pretty important. They use the information they have and do a 
presentation in front of the whole class.  
</P>
<P>
 They have to focus on an assigned area -- say the plant life in the rain 
forest. They do overhead slides, and draw diagrams on the board labeling 
everything. I have told them I will be checking on how much information they 
have gathered on, for example, photosynthesis. 
</P>
<P>
 Every single student has something to offer. As a teacher its my job to find 
out what that thing is and to pull it out.  
</P>
<P>
 One of our lessons had to do with ancient Egypt. So I had one group working on 
Pharaoh's court, another on how they would do things in the market place, 
another on what they believe about afterlife and a fourth group was working on 
gods and goddesses in ancient Egypt. The first step is for them to get together 
as a group and isolate information they find interesting. The second step was 
to get them to go to the library and get Egyptian music.  
</P>
<P>
 Once they get the information they use mime to the music and the rest of the 
class has to figure out what they are trying to convey. So they get on the 
tables while everybody else is watching them they act out, without any words, 
information they are trying to convey. While they are doing that the rest of 
the group is trying to write words for the mime. They are learning social 
studies but through spatial movements. They end up writing a script for a play. 
</P>
<P>
 This year we have talked about most of the Impressionist paintings and the 
kids not only try to interpret that art but also learn about the artists. It is 
interesting for them because they learn that many of the artists, when they 
were kids, had similar experiences to what a lot of these kids are going 
through.  
</P>
<P>
 In another instance they were reading John Lennon and he recalled his days 
sitting in the classroom wondering "when will these people realize what I have 
to offer -- I have so much to offer but nobody seems to thinks I'm any good." 
So we listen to Lennon's music and then you tell the students this is how he 
felt how many of you have felt that way and they connect with it. We see the 
students excelling and then come back after junior high and it has worked for 
them. Ninety percent of what they watch on television news and elsewhere is so 
negative. We have to teach them to look for the positives in themselves.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: YOUTH / OPINION; 
GENERATION X: 'WE TEND TO VALUE THINGS INSTEAD OF LIFE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTEN PERRY, Kristen Perry, 16, is a junior at Canyon High School in 
Canyon Country. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every generation has had its trademark. The "lost generation" of the 1920s had 
the flappers and bathtub gin. The '60s saw a surge in free thinking and even 
freer drug use. The '70s gave rise to the "me generation" and the '80s 
glorified greed. 
</P>
<P>
 What characterizes the '90s?  
</P>
<P>
 Violence, racism, AIDS, drugs, mothers killing babies, kids killing kids, 
people killing themselves. Generation X is the second "lost generation." We're 
not lost in the emergence of new ideas or new social reform, though, we're just 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems no one in this generation has a hold on anything important. As a 
whole, we tend to value things instead of life, rewards instead of honor and 
getting high instead of facing reality. We've made some progress: People have 
started to value the spotted owl and the hump-backed whale. But that's not 
enough. We have to start valuing humans and everything humans, at their best, 
have to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Young people have a lot to deal with, and yes, it's hard, sometimes 
impossible, but there's always a solution. In the age of instant gratification, 
too many people don't give problems time to work themselves through. Instead, 
they go for the quick fix: drugs, alcohol, abortion, revenge, suicide. Patience 
is a virtue Generation X has not yet learned. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the media have pointed fingers at River Phoenix and Kurt Cobain for 
sending "the wrong message" to America's youth. I think it's the other way 
around. Phoenix and Cobain were not the cause of the current ugliness, they 
were the result.  
</P>
<P>
 We tried to attribute these tragic deaths to their victims being overly 
sensitive and creative, but that's not it. It's not just Hollywood that can't 
cope with problems, it's everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few decades, life has been degraded. No one takes it seriously 
anymore. My dad's friend, Mike, recently had to face having his legs amputated. 
The doctors didn't expect him to live until the end of the month. But he is 
still holding on. He's alive because of his sheer will to live. That very will 
that is keeping Mike alive is all but vanishing everywhere else. It blows my 
mind to see such disrespect for human life while Mike is struggling to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 When I look at my generation, I don't see the hope, the passion and the faith 
that I would expect to see in young people with the world at their feet. In 
place of such vibrancy, I see emptiness. Cobain put it well in Nirvana's 
multi-platinum album: "whatever -- Nevermind." 
</P>
<P>
 Look at tennis star Jennifer Capriati, who seemed on to be top of the world. 
But last week she was arrested on a marijuana possession charge. That didn't 
used to happen to average 18-year-olds but nowadays it's becoming increasingly 
common.  
</P>
<P>
 It's too late for blame; we couldn't possibly pinpoint where society took a 
wrong turn. Generation X hasn't been taught the value of life. We haven't been 
taught a lot of things, things we'll learn the hard way somewhere down the 
line. Somehow we have to turn our lives around so that drugs, despair, and 
suicide don't become the trademarks of our generation. 
</P>
<P>
 The future is in our hands. We have the power to overcome the problems we've 
inherited and the ones we've developed on our own. We have the power to bring 
meaning back to life.

THE SYMBOLISM OF TACO BELL; DO THE DEAL -- KEEP ITS HEADQUARTERS IN IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The political battle in Sacramento over trying to keep Taco Bell from moving 
its corporate headquarters from Irvine to Texas has become a lightning rod in 
the debate over California's competitiveness. At some point, legislators will 
have to decide whether the need to boost the state's economy justifies granting 
sizable tax incentives to the company. 
</P>
<P>
 We think that the timing is right. The investment is worth making. The 
granting of incentives would make a statement about post-recession California 
and serve as a triggering mechanism for new investment and growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week a bill by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, (D-San Francisco) that 
would have given tax breaks to companies that expanded or established corporate 
headquarters in the state was turned back narrowly in the Senate Revenue and 
Taxation Committee. But that is not likely to be the end of it.  
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, there was the argument that granting immediate breaks for new 
businesses would cost too much in the short term because the state already is 
in a fiscal bind. On the other hand, a bipartisan group that includes Gov. Pete 
Wilson has argued that the investment would pay off down the road by generating 
new income taxes and other revenues associated with an increase in business.  
</P>
<P>
 Legislators are still sorting out the arguments, but for now the defeat of the 
Brown measure is a setback in the effort to keep Taco Bell's headquarters in 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taco Bell situation is precisely illustrative not only because it is a 
high-profile situation that could go either way but because it contains so many 
of the prevailing concerns related to California business competitiveness. The 
company has said all along that it would stay in California if the numbers 
could be made to pencil out but that it would leave if incentives offered 
elsewhere proved irresistible.  
</P>
<P>
 The Brown plan in effect would have given Taco Bell breaks close to the $10 
million in incentives being offered by Texas. Under the scenario envisioned by 
the Assembly Speaker, the dislocation and $20 million in moving costs would 
have been a price that Taco Bell was unwilling to pay. Whether the bill is 
changed or is added to other legislation later, some kind of incentive should 
be found to hold and attract companies like Taco Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 It is important to keep in mind that if Taco Bell or any other big corporation 
were to leave California, all the hand-wringing about the short-term cost to 
the state resulting from tax breaks would not matter in the end anyway. After 
all, the revenue that arises from having the headquarters in the state now 
would vanish. And by helping invest in the future of companies, California 
ultimately will invest in itself.

WELL WROUGHT WAY WITH POEMS; CLEANTH BROOKS' CRITICISM OFFERED REMARKABLE 
INSIGHT OVER TWO GENERATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the history of American best sellers, only one book of pure literary 
criticism -- literary criticism unconnected to the Bible or to an alleged 
collapse of American values -- has ever made it to the list. The year was 1947, 
and the book was "The Well Wrought Urn: Studies in the Structure of Poetry" by 
Cleanth Brooks, who died at Yale earlier this month at the age of 87. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks was a practitioner of "New Criticism," a criticism that challenged the 
historicism dominant in his day (and dominant again in our own) by asserting 
that the greatest works of literature transcend history and that close 
attention to what writers actually write can reveal why they do. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks agreed with T. S. Eliot that poetry proceeds by "perpetual slight 
alteration of language," and such was his skill at tracking alterations that 
the reader of a poem he analyzed could all but hear the poet's quill scratching 
on the page. Brooks erased the difference between practical and academic 
criticism, between advice given to a writer during the writing and analysis 
afterward. He was a poet himself as well as a critic and was co-founder, with 
poet Robert Penn Warren, of a literary magazine, the Southern Review. 
</P>
<P>
 The title of Brooks' best seller came from "The Canonization," by the 
17th-Century poet John Donne, a poem celebrating the secular sanctity of lovers 
who, like saints, count the whole world as nothing compared to their love. Wars 
rage, lawsuits drag on, but lovers know what really matters. When life is done, 
if the story of their love should prove no epic fit to fill the walls of a 
king's "half-acre tomb," it may yet suffice for a simple urn to hold their 
ashes. And then, if the urn be "well wrought," it may teach love -- and 
indifference to the world -- to those who come after. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Well Wrought Urn" was Brooks' own well wrought urn. Poetry and he were 
lovers. For two generations and more they have come to life together on his 
pages, enabling thousands to find their way to a lifelong love of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 May he rest in peace and beauty. And may his book live long in print.

NUCLEAR WEAPONS SPREAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the U.S. struggles with its military strategies to deal with the rogue 
nations that are now capable of nuclear terrorism ("Nuclear Dominoes," May 8, 
9, 10) it's time to recognize our failed strategies that brought us to this 
point in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 The facts of history have proven that the aerial tanker for in-flight 
refueling is the single greatest technology in aviation today. The global 
reach, global power, go-anywhere capability of the modern Air Force is the 
direct result of tankers. This technology was proposed in 1943 as a means to 
bomb a then-unreachable Japan. Luddites in the Air Force, comfortably seated in 
their armchairs overlooking the Potomac, could not see the potential in this 
technology and turned it down for the then-rapidly failing strategy of daylight 
formation bombing in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the Air Force accepted tankers and in-flight refueling, when proposed, and 
had long-range single airplane nighttime bombing, so successful late in the 
war, been introduced in 1943, Japan's surrender would have occurred long before 
the introduction of the atomic bomb that brought the Soviets rushing to our 
"aid." The costly (100,000 casualties) march up through the Central Pacific for 
the sole purpose of obtaining airfields closer to Japan could have been 
avoided. Our present nightmare in the North Pacific is a direct result of the 
Air Force's reluctance to change its strategy and allowing the Soviets to claim 
hegemony over North Korea and the Kurils after only five days of "fighting" on 
our side.

<P>
 The strategic missile submarine was a major contributor to winning the Cold 
War. Since 1960, our 41 Polaris ballistic missile submarines have made 
literally thousands of deterrent patrols. The SSBN (Submarine Ballistic 
Nuclear) is the most complicated machine ever made by mankind and yet one of 
the most effective, both militarily and economically. 
</P>
<P>
 All 41 older Polaris-type missile submarines will be retired by the end of 
this year and just our Trident submarines will remain; 14 of the 18 authorized 
have been commissioned. The Trident carries 24 missiles, whereas the Polaris 
carried only 16 missiles. Each Trident has the capacity to launch and deliver a 
staggering 240 warheads. A weapon system of such awesome power will definitely 
make an adversary think twice before nuking the United States. The SSBN 
continues to play a vital role in maintaining a stabilized nuclear deterrence 
against present and future threats to U.S. security. Incidentally, the U.S.

not 18 attack submarines as noted in the May 10 article. We will have 18

 Thirty-one billion dollars for "strategic nuclear weapons," this year's

U.S. nuclear arsenal be scrapped" (May 10).

HIV TESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That Los Angeles County's HIV/AIDS counseling and testing program ranked among 
the worst in the country is not the most shameful news we face (May 10). What 
is worse is that low public confidence and awareness about HIV testing are 
killing people.We need easy and anonymous ways to access counseling and testing 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Gabriel Valley there isn't enough money for condom distribution or 
the production of public service announcements. Last year, the local anonymous 
testing program was shut down for four weeks because funds ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County has the second highest incidence of HIV and AIDS in the 
nation (1 in 193 adults are HIV positive) and half the people who are infected 
don't know it. 
</P>
<P>
 There is some hope, though. Many of us who work in the field have begun 
endorsing home HIV test kits, which provide counseling by phone as well as 
literature and referral information. While the personal approach of the 
clinical setting is our first choice, home testing kits can be an important 
alternative.  
</P>
<P>
 With AIDS caseloads swelling daily and public awareness trailing far behind, 
everyone needs easy, confidential access to his or her HIV status now. The 
county can accomplish this effectively, but not without community support and 
more funding of AIDS prevention and education.

WELFARE REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As I understand the gist of "Welfare Reform Rhetoric Rings Hollow in the 
Delta" (May 9), welfare reform won't work in rural areas because welfare 
recipients aren't willing to move to where the jobs are. Since when should I, 
as a U.S. taxpayer, have to pay someone's living expenses so that she can live 
near her family? Going where the jobs are is basic fact of employment. 
Middle-class people frequently relocate to other cities where they can get 
better jobs, newly graduated college students move to where they have job 
offers, and many employees of large companies are transferred across the 
country. Why should the "rules" be different for people on welfare than for the 
middle class? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 If anything needs reforming in our country it has to be the social welfare 
system. If figures tell us something, "the system" has led to a major portion 
of our prison population, a major portion of our drug distribution and abuse, a 
major portion of our teen-age motherhood, and a major portion of our child 
abuse caseload. On the "Nightline" show some months ago, Surgeon General 
Joycelyn Elders stated that 82% of men incarcerated in our prisons were 
products of "the system." They were fatherless, abused or neglected children, 
undereducated, poor, and led into a life of crime well before their teen years. 
If we know these data, is it not time to fix the system that leads to such 
unwanted results? What industry would continue a product line or service that 
gave such consistently poor results? None. Yet, the local and federal 
governments encourage fatherless children, generational poverty, and dependence 
on "the system" from cradle to the grave. Changes are long overdue. Is there 
enough commitment at the top to start the process to restore dignity, 
independence, and hope to an underclass locked into "the system"? I hope so.

GULF WAR ILLNESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My compliments for your thoughtful, informative editorial (May 10) relating to 
illnesses reported by returning Gulf War veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 As explained in the article, many Gulf War personnel were exposed 
inadvertently or otherwise to a variety of potentially toxic agents, some of 
which were administered in hopes of protecting them from still worse 
toxicities, namely those posed by biological or chemical warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, it has fallen to the federal government and more particularly the 
Department of Veterans Affairs to investigate and resolve the validity of these 
reports and in so doing hopefully assuage the fears of those with these illness 
as well as those yet unaffected. One can further anticipate that these efforts 
will involve extensive, elaborate and costly epidemiologic and clinical 
surveys, the results of which may be months away. 
</P>
<P>
 What deserves publicizing at this point is that individual VA facilities such 
as ours through participation in the Persian Gulf Veterans Registry Project are 
keenly aware of these medical problems and are endeavoring to evaluate them and 
provide therapy when appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 As the coordinator for this project at the Sepulveda VA I can affirm that no 
Gulf veterans' complaints are dismissed or disregarded and I am confident that 
this is no less the case at other VA hospitals and clinics.

KATHLEEN BROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's no surprise to this voter that Kathleen Brown would try and dictate press 
coverage of any debates (May 13). In her dismal attempt not to offend any 
potential voters, she has failed to take definitive stands on issues large and 
small.I would hope that all three debates are televised regardless of whether 
Brown shows up or not. Her participation may not be that important, since her 
"take no position" strategy would produce only slogans (i.e., "1 million new 
jobs") rather than substance anyway. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Brown's Republican predecessor in the state treasurer's office, Tom Hayes, 
took a careful and measured approach to the selling of California's public 
bonds. In her successful bid to unseat him, Brown sniped at his 
"foot-dragging," though her suggested alternative of dumping billions of 
dollars of bonds onto the market would have resulted in a significant 
devaluation of their worth. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a pity that most Californians will not have read Paul Jacobs' 
well-researched May 13 article on Brown's performance in office. As state 
treasurer, she has adhered to Hayes' policy far more closely than her campaign 
suggested and has shown that she is far more responsible as an officeholder 
than she was as a candidate. Her present antics as a gubernatorial candidate -- 
the dirty sniping at other candidates followed by holding out an olive branch, 
and now her refusal to participate in open debates -- smack of more calculating 
and maneuvering to win the governorship. Winning is more important to Brown 
than being honest.

RESTORATION WATCH; WELCOME HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes there is a happy ending. After months of negotiations, R. H. Macy & 
Co. has returned nearly all the historically significant fixtures and 
furnishings it removed last year from its now-shuttered Bullocks Wilshire 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 The building, completed in 1929, is so majestic an example of Art Deco 
architecture that it is on the National Register of Historic Places. But 
municipal and federal laws protect only the building, not movable fixtures, no 
matter how historic or splendid. Because Macy's owns the lease on the Bullocks 
property, it was legally entitled to use the more than 200 decorative items 
however and wherever it wanted. Some of these one-of-a-kind items found their 
way into other Macy-owned stores.  
</P>
<P>
 But legalities aside, Macy's action caused hurt feelings locally. City 
leaders, including Mayor Richard Riordan, and preservationists campaigned 
relentlessly for the return of the chandeliers, urns, clocks, fireplace screens 
and sconces removed from the mid-Wilshire property. 
</P>
<P>
 After protracted, tense negotiations, Macy's has done the right thing, 
returning 166 items proved through photographic records to be original to the 
store. These items will be on display when the facility is reopened next year 
as a library for the Southwestern University School of Law. Public tours of the 
facility will be conducted.  
</P>
<P>
 Preservationists regard the return of these precious items as a national 
precedent for historic properties elsewhere. Beyond that, it is a sweet ending 
indeed for one struggling building in a struggling neighborhood of Los Angeles.

PLATFORM; LET POLICE PAY THE BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAROL HEPPE is executive director of Police Watch/the Police Misconduct 
Referral Service. She told The Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a recent study by a group of attorneys, accountants, insurers and 
consultants, it was found that the city of Los Angeles could save millions of 
dollars by holding city department heads responsible for the expenses their 
agencies run up. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the focus of this study was applied to settlements and lawsuits of 
workers' compensation claims, the same recommendation should apply to the Los 
Angeles Police Department claims, settlements and lawsuits in cases of 
excessive use of force. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, 246 lawsuits were filed against the LAPD, up from 226 the previous 
year. Also, the filing of claims against the city in police-abuse cases was up 
to 726 from 585. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the city paid more than $10 million in settlements and lawsuits 
against the LAPD in cases involving excessive use of force; the city has paid 
out that much already in the first four months of 1994.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Risk Management Task Force believes that top bureaucrats would do 
more to reduce payouts if the city took the money out of their budgets instead 
of from a general reserve account. By holding the LAPD financially accountable, 
it follows that officers will be forced to take citizens' complaints seriously. 
By carefully monitoring officers who accumulate inordinate numbers of civilian 
complaints, supervisors and commanders can determine the nature of the problem 
and act before it results in financial liability to the city.

THE BEAT COP TAKES A BACK SEAT, AGAIN; LAPD: THE CITY WANTED TO GIVE PATROL 
OFFICERS EXTRA MONEY, BUT UNION LEADERS SHOT DOWN THE PROPOSAL. WHY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARVIN BRAUDE, Marvin Braude is president pro tem of the Los Angeles City 
Council and chairman of the Public Safety Committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles police officers have overwhelmingly rejected a proposed contract, 
citing as their primary reason its lack of retroactive pay raises for the past 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 However, other crucial issues were involved, especially two badly needed 
reforms that the people want and the Police Department needs -- but which were 
kept out of the proposed contract by the labor union that represents the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake were two public-policy questions crucial to running an efficient and 
effective Police Department. First, can we pay patrol officers, who put their 
lives on the line for the public every day, a salary bonus to encourage them to 
remain as patrol officers? Second, can we allow Chief Willie Williams the 
flexibility he needs -- like private-sector chief executives have -- to assign 
officers where they're needed most and can work most effectively? 
</P>
<P>
 In the city's final contract offer to the police union, the mayor and City 
Council included these two crucial provisions. Both steps were recommended by 
the Christopher Commission, which studied the Police Department in detail after 
the Rodney King beating and made wide-ranging recommendations to reform its 
operations, policies and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 In his report, Chairman Warren Christopher told the city the obvious: that 
police officers see patrol duty as a dead end for career advancement, and 
officers try to get out of patrol work as quickly as they can. Allowing that to 
continue is bad policy, Christopher said, because the city needs experienced 
patrol officers working the streets, giving the people the best possible 
protection from crime. 
</P>
<P>
 To right that bad policy, the mayor and council agreed to give patrol officers 
a 2% bonus. That's in addition to the 3% salary raise in each of the next two 
years, which was offered to police in spite of the fact that other city 
employees got no salary increase for the last three years and probably next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 And to give Williams the management flexibility he needs, the city's last 
offer proposed a change in work rules so that sergeants and lieutenants could 
be assigned where they were needed, and not frozen in their assignments by 
pay-grade steps within their ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 But for reasons of their own, the leaders of the police union rejected both 
the patrol bonus and the work-rule changes the chief needs. The union insisted 
that other goodies be included instead in the contract, such as additional 
vacation for veteran officers who already receive three weeks of paid vacation 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the prospect of protracted labor negotiations with the police, the 
mayor and council blinked; they allowed the union to set the public-policy 
agenda by dropping these two crucial provisions, and agreed to a contract 
without them. 
</P>
<P>
 Union members voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to reject that contract. It's 
unclear how the situation will be resolved, but the rejection may be a blessing 
in disguise for the people of Los Angeles; it may again place the issue of the 
patrol bonus and work-rule changes on the table for negotiation, where they 
belong, and maybe they can now be adopted, as the Christopher Commission 
recommended and as the people want. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that union members have refused to approve their contract, they should 
ponder this question: What kind of leadership does their union have when it is 
willing to sacrifice a 2% bonus for patrol officers -- a bonus that would bring 
their salary increase to 5% -- turning its back on the officers who are the 
heart and soul of the department and the primary reason it enjoys such strong 
public support? 
</P>
<P>
 Union members, especially those in patrol assignments, should realize that the 
union, and not the City Council, took away the patrol bonus. The mayor and 
council were eager to strengthen the department by acknowledging, with higher 
pay, those officers on the front lines of fighting crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that they have lost the patrol bonus, which was their one best chance of 
being recognized for the special and difficult work they do, patrol officers 
should ask their elected union officers why the bonus was dropped and why the 
union board also rejected the strong Christopher recommendations for reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrol officers deserve an explanation as to why their own union said no to 
more patrol pay, a stronger police department and the protection the public 
deserves.

CALIFORNIA COMMENTARY; HANDICAPPED BY OUR ATTITUDE; RAILROADS, EXPENSIVE 
HIGHWAYS, MILITARY BASES, WATER PROJECTS -- THE FEDS DON'T OWE US, THE FEDS 
CREATED US. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC REISNER, Marc Reisner, author of Cadillac Desert, (Viking-Penguin), is 
writing a book about contemporary California. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I lived in New York in the 1970s and the appallingly run city government 
finally tottered into bankruptcy, Mayor Abraham Beame went to Washington to 
request a loan from President Ford and got a reply that the New York Daily News 
conjured into the most memorable headline of the decade: "Ford to City: Drop 
Dead." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a wonderful banner, capturing the arrogance, self-absorption and acute 
denial that prompted most Americans to resent, if not detest, New York. So what 
if it was the financial and cultural capital of the modern universe? Why should 
American taxpayers rescue a city with 362,849 full-time employees on the public 
payroll in 1974 that considered itself too broke to replace its Depression-era 
subway cars or fix an elevated highway that once swallowed a Mercedes?  
</P>
<P>
 Recently, I came across a remark from a Los Angeles politician that may be 
destined for the same immortality as that New York headline. Assemblywoman 
Paula L. Boland (R-Granada Hills) was explaining her tireless opposition to 
even a modest and temporary state sales-tax surcharge earmarked for earthquake 
relief. "Californians are taxed to death," she said. "The feds are going to 
have to come through for us. The President owes us. . . . They've taken our 
military bases and all those jobs. They're going to have to start giving 
something back to California." 
</P>
<P>
 Stop that assemblywoman! The rest of the country resents us enough already. 
Don't they look out here and see a paradise: our heart-stopping coastline, the 
Sierra Nevada and the redwoods, the fabulous food, the movie stars, the sex- 
and drug-suffused lives that people lead in places like Fullerton? 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, during a couple of recent trips to the heartland where many of us 
originated, I detected, for the first time, some genuine pity for California, 
which Boland threatens to zap in the bud. Some Americans have finally 
recognized California for what it is -- a phony paradise whose habitation 
involves substantial risk and, when disaster inevitably strikes, tremendous 
upheaval and cost. Four of the 10 most expensive "natural" disasters in U.S. 
history -- the Loma Prieta and Northridge earthquakes, the Oakland fire and 
last autumn's Southland wildfire siege -- have occurred here within the past 
five years. But how long can you pity a place where misfortunes never cease and 
are the result, in large part, of others' generosity and a peculiar, nativist 
willfulness? 
</P>
<P>
 The feds owe us? California is in many ways an invention of federal largess. 
The first paradise seekers who arrived here came mainly by rail, on 
transcontinental track whose construction was subsidized by the frontier 
government's principal currency, land.  
</P>
<P>
 Once here, the seekers saw what paradise lacked -- water -- and so, with the 
secret connivance of the federal government, Los Angeles managed to snaffle 
lots of it from the Owens Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 When that source was soon over-tapped, the federal government erected Hoover 
Dam, then the largest on Earth, mainly for California's benefit. Later, it 
built part of the State Water Project so Southern California could grow more 
crowded and rich. In case agriculture felt slighted, the despised feds built 
the Central Valley Project, which is still the planet's grandest webwork of 
dams and aqueducts, and much of a levee system along the Sacramento River that 
rivals the Mississippi's. CVP irrigation water is ludicrously subsidized, at 
the expense of many struggling farmers in the South and Midwest; the levees and 
flood control were essentially free. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers elsewhere paid for most of California's interstate highway system, 
which was even more expensive that it is extensive. A single mile of the 
Century Freeway -- a multilane, elevated, earthquake-proof monstrosity that was 
reamed through expensive, if decrepit, real estate -- cost almost as much as 
interstates laid across some small states, even if you factor inflation. 
Washington "took" so many of our military bases because it gave us so many, 
even before the defense spending of the Reagan and Bush years, which laid out a 
smorgasbord worth probably $200 billion to Southern California alone. 
</P>
<P>
 So what do we want now? Many of our politicians, including the governor, 
subscribe to the interesting notion that the rest of the country should pay 
whenever California burns up or dries up or drowns or falls apart. After 
Northridge (and despite much grumbling by members from geologically boring 
states), Congress voted us $8.6 billion in emergency relief, and now the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency is sitting down to the 360,000 applications 
for assistance it has received to date (an all-time record, despite two 
horrendous recent hurricanes). The wildfires prompted further aid from 
Washington, as did the drought, the floods and the $850-million crop freeze in 
1990 that no one remembers any more. 
</P>
<P>
 What will happen when -- as many seismologists predict sometime in the next 30 
years -- the Hayward Fault under Oakland and Berkeley slips, causing as much as 
$240 billion worth of destruction? Will Boland's counterparts say that American 
taxpayers should rebuild everything? What happens when the Big One jostles 
several trillion dollars' worth of real estate down here? 
</P>
<P>
 If Californians wish to preserve whatever national goodwill they still own, 
they should force their candidates (who are also asking for more legitimate aid 
to deal with such burdens as illegal immigration) to address these questions. 
They might also ask who is subsidizing whom within the state. Why, for example, 
should homeowners at low fire risk subsidize others -- which they do, through 
assigned-risk insurance pools -- who insist on building in the worst wildfire 
habitat on Earth?  
</P>

 There is, of course, much to be said for the government's huge investments in 
California. We dominate some of the economy's strongest sectors -- aerospace, 
agriculture, entertainment. We may soon represent a fifth of the gross national 
product; all of that productivity and wealth keep most of us here.  
</P>
<P>
 But Californians, like New Yorkers in the 1970s, have developed not so much a 
bad attitude as a blind attitude, which is worse. In the wake of the wildfire 
siege, I listened to a radio talk-show host congratulate a caller who was 
determined to rebuild a Malibu home that he had already rebuilt after the 
wildfire of 1970. Now that, said the host, is rugged individualism. It's a good 
thing they don't broadcast such nonsense to Iowa, where they see it as sending 
taxes to Sean Penn.

KNICKS PUT END TO ERA BY FINISHING OFF BULLS; NBA PLAYOFFS: NEW YORK WINS, 
87-77, TO ADVANCE TO EASTERN FINALS AND HALT CHICAGO'S CHAMPIONSHIP REIGN. 
</P>

<P>
 Inevitability and their archrivals finally caught up to the Chicago Bulls, 
even if the Knicks needed a seventh game in Madison Square Garden to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight months after Michael Jordan retired, the three-time defending NBA 
champions finally succumbed, losing, 87-77, to the Knicks in Sunday's Game 7 of 
their Eastern semifinal series and calling it a day and a dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to be thought of as a beginning for us," said a relieved Knick Coach 
Pat Riley, "because for some reason or other, it happened to us in Los Angeles, 
with the Boston Celtics. We had to beat the world champions (in 1985 after 
eight failures). 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first year (as a Knick) against (the Bulls) in the playoffs, they had won 
a title and we couldn't beat them in seven games. We were matched up against 
them last season, and we could not beat them in six games and this year we had 
to play them again. 
</P>
<P>
 "So somewhere, some team had to put them away. It was fortunate for us because 
we really aspire to what they worked so hard to achieve." 
</P>
<P>
 It was truly fortunate for them that Sunday's deciding game was here, too, 
because the Bulls had won their last nine playoff meetings at Chicago Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do want to send a thank-you letter to the Boston Celtics," said Riley, 
mentioning his second-least-favorite team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never have done that in my life, but they beat Chicago on Friday 
night prior to the end of the season, which gave us the home-court advantage. I 
would have much rather played here today than Chicago Stadium." 
</P>
<P>
 This was supposed to be a lost season for the suddenly Jordan-less Bulls, but 
they won 55 games. After buckling on the last weekend of the regular season -- 
needing to win two games at home for the East's best record, they lost to the 
Celtics and Knicks -- they were expected to go quickly in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they swept the Cleveland Cavaliers, then stuck around to torture the 
Knicks for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Bulls tied the series, 2-2, John Starks acknowledged he had thought 
it would be over by then. 
</P>
<P>
 The best/worst was yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks pulled out Game 5 in New York on Hubert Davis' free throws, only 
after referee Hue Hollins broke with officiating tradition, called a foul on 
Scottie Pippen for tapping Davis on the wrist after the ball was away and put 
him on the line to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chicago, where Blackhawk fans have spent 30 years talking about a memorable 
loss, known as Red Storey Night in honor of an NHL referee, May 18, 1994 has 
been inscribed as Hue Hollins Night. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, the Bulls blew the Knicks away in Game 6 and scared them Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than three minutes into Game 7, Patrick Ewing got his second foul, and 
Riley benched him the rest of the first quarter. Riley said he had visions of 
the Bulls pulling away. They had done it often enough with Ewing in there, 
leading by 15, eight, 22, 19, nine and 19 points in the first six games, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks managed to take a 22-19 lead into the second quarter, whereupon 
Ewing returned and proceeded to go scoreless for 12 minutes. At halftime, he 
and Starks had one free throw between them. But the Knicks still led, 38-37. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the Bulls had caught Knick Disease. They couldn't shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 They made four shots longer than 15 feet the entire first half, only two after 
the first 90 seconds. If they're wondering when this prize tuna got off the 
hook, there it was. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't play the kind of game we needed (in) the first half, (the kind) I 
thought we needed to take into the second half," Bull Coach Phil Jackson said. 
"From that point, we couldn't absorb the run we knew they were going to make." 
</P>
<P>
 It came at the end of the third quarter, with Jackson resting Pippen. 
Trailing, 63-59, the Knicks went on a 21-7 run and the greatest championship 
run since the Celtics' 1959-1966 string was over.

ANGELS' STREAK FINISHED; BASEBALL: ROYALS' CONE THROWS ONE-HITTER TO EXTEND 
SCORELESS RUN IN 4-0 VICTORY. LACHEMANN HAS FIRST LOSS AS MANAGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A team that hadn't lost under its new manager came up against a pitcher who 
hadn't given up a run in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the manager has a loss. The pitcher, David Cone, still has his scoreless 
string, which reached 28 innings with a one-hitter as the Kansas City Royals 
snapped a four-game Angel winning streak with a 4-0 victory Sunday at Anaheim 
Stadium. The Royals ended a 3-0 honeymoon for Manager Marcel Lachemann. 
</P>
<P>
 Chili Davis' single to left field leading off the fifth inning was the Angels' 
only hit, but they are still leaving on an eight-game trip to Detroit, Toronto 
and Cleveland in a good mood. Sunday's loss in front of 35,915 did not lessen 
the euphoria surrounding their winning streak and the kinder, gentler 
Lachemann. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a great attitude on this team right now," Davis said. "I 
think the guys are going to play really hard for him. I hated to see the game 
end in a double play, because we weren't thinking it was over. That's the mode 
we're in right now. Until the last out is made, we think we can win." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no dramatic rally against Cone, however. Leading off the ninth, Gary 
DiSarcina reached on an error by Wally Joyner, was forced by Harold Reynolds 
and Chad Curtis ended the game with a bouncer to Cone, who started the double 
play. Cone (8-1) leads the league in victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today was just a case of a guy having an 89-91 m.p.h. fastball, a good 
forkball, a hell of slider and the confidence to throw all three any time," 
left fielder Dwight Smith said. "You just have to take your hat off to the 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Cone, 31, has allowed eight hits in his last three games, which include a 9-0 
victory over Minnesota on May 11 and a 4-0 victory at Seattle on Tuesday. On 
Sunday, he pitched the 43rd complete game, 19th shutout and third one-hitter of 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know pitching is not easy, but he's making it look easy," Royal Manager Hal 
McRae said. "There were no threats for nine innings. It made for a very 
relaxing afternoon to watch a ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Langston, making his third start for the Angels since arthroscopic elbow 
surgery April 12, gave up 10 hits -- two of them home runs -- in 5 2/3 innings. 
John Dopson, recently dropped from the starting rotation, retired all 10 
batters he faced in relief of Langston (2-2). 
</P>
<P>
 The Royals got to Langston for a run in the second inning when Dave Henderson 
walked and Felix Jose and Hubie Brooks singled to right field. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City went ahead, 3-0, in the third. Terry Shumpert hit Langston's first 
pitch over the center field fence. One out later, Henderson crushed Langston's 
0-1 delivery, depositing it 20 rows deep in the left field seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Cone was perfect through the first three innings. He gave up a walk to 
Reynolds in the fourth, and then Davis ended any no-hit hopes when he hit 
Cone's 1-2 fastball. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way I was thinking no-hitter," Cone said. "I'm getting early runs 
and that makes me that much more comfortable and that much more aggressive. I 
established a good fastball on the inside part of the plate early, and that set 
up a lot of other stuff later." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's warning-track fly ball to center field in the fifth inning and 
DiSarcina's line-drive out to right in the third were the only balls the Angels 
hit hard all afternoon. Davis singled only because he is strong enough to deal 
with Cone's outside fastball. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not going to give in to you," Davis said. "You're going to have to hit 
his pitch. He throws from so many angles and at so many speeds, he keeps you 
pretty uncomfortable. It's like he's inventing pitches out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the loss, Lachemann's post-game analysis was upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a lot of real good things the last four days and I liked the way we 
kept battling today," he said. "We were sure going to try to win them all, but 
I imagine we might even lose another one in there somewhere."

DODGERS RECYCLE THE REDS; BASEBALL: L.A. WINS AGAIN, 10-3, AS BUTLER GOES FOUR 
FOR FIVE AND IS LEFT NEEDING ONLY A DOUBLE TO MAKE THE RECORD BOOK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dodgers left for Los Angeles on Sunday night with a 3 1/2-game lead in the 
National League West after beating the Cincinnati Reds, 10-3, and winning two 
of three games at Riverfront Stadium, where the Reds have the best home record 
in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is little this team does that surprises anymore, unless it's Brett 
Butler almost hitting for the cycle.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think when Brett Butler hits a home run, there isn't anybody in the world 
who isn't surprised, especially Butler," Manager Tom Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Butler walked to the plate for the fifth time Sunday, all he needed was a 
double. He had already hit a triple, two singles and his third home run of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler swung so hard in striking out against reliever Pete Schourek that he 
threw the bat halfway to the mound. But for a guy who thought he was getting 
the day off, his four-for-five performance with three runs scored and three 
runs batted in was more than acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody told me before I hit my single (in the sixth inning) that I should 
just keep running, but I couldn't do that, that ball was hit right at him," 
said Butler, who is batting .350. "It's never happened to me, hitting for the 
cycle, but I was trying too hard in the fifth at-bat, putting too much pressure 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Dodgers kept the pressure on the Reds, becoming only the fourth team 
to win a series against the National League Central leaders this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Piazza hit a towering three-run homer to left in the Dodgers' six-run 
sixth inning, going two for three in the game and scoring two runs. Raul 
Mondesi hit two doubles, extending his hitting streak to 14 games, and also 
scored twice and drove in a run. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Astacio (3-3) had his fifth solid outing in six starts, holding the Reds 
to one run and seven hits in eight innings and lowering his earned-run average 
to 3.77. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a game of momentum and of streaks, but I think the thing that is the 
best about this team is how we bounce back after a tough loss," Piazza said. 
"There have been a couple of games we have lost in the ninth inning that we 
should have won, but we didn't let them get us down." 
</P>
<P>
 Since splitting a four-game series with the San Francisco Giants, the Dodgers 
have won 11 of their last 13 games. They swept the Houston Astros and the San 
Diego Padres, then won three of four from Colorado and two of three from the 
Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers dominated Sunday's game from the beginning, with Butler hitting 
starter Tim Pugh's first pitch into the gap in right-center field for his 
league-leading sixth triple this season. Pugh (3-2) gave up four runs in five 
innings and Schourek pitched the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler has 21 triples the last two seasons, but his three home runs are one 
shy of his total output the past two seasons, and the Dodgers have played only 
44 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reggie (Smith, the Dodgers' hitting instructor) has worked with me and 
helped, he showed me some things over the past five years when I have hit well 
and what has worked," Butler said. "I've been known for hitting the ball up the 
middle and the other way, bunting a lot and taking the first pitch, so I have 
changed things a little, like swinging early in the count and trying to mess up 
the scouting report." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides his new-found power, Butler, who has 257 career bunts, leads the 
league with a .480 on-base percentage and 35 walks. He ranks in the top 10 with 
11 stolen bases, 56 hits, 36 runs scored and a .350 batting average. And all he 
set out to do this season was to enjoy himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year was so bad and the year before was terrible, we struggled, but '91 
was a blast," said Butler, who will turn 37 June 15. "So when I left for 
Florida this spring I said I was going to go out and have fun. I'm in the last 
year of my contract and I don't know what is going to happen. So this year I'm 
trying to enjoy myself a little more."

MORNING BRIEFING: HARTFORD WRITER USES HIS PEN TO HARPOON EX-WHALER COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hartford Courant hockey writer Jeff Jacobs didn't hold anything back when 
commenting on the firing of Whaler Coach Pierre McGuire. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 15 years of covering the NHL, we had never seen a coach so universally 
disrespected and disliked within his own organization," Jacobs wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a young man is so headstrong, so emotional, so calculating, such a 
control freak, so full of ambition and so full of himself, he will either 
rocket to the top or crash. 
</P>

 "McGuire fancied himself two parts Scotty Bowman and one part Bob Johnson. It

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS / WESTERN CONFERENCE; VANCOUVER GETS OFFENSIVE JUST IN 
TIME TO BEAT TORONTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Vancouver Canucks played 57 1/2 minutes of perfect defense Sunday and got 
what 57 1/2 minutes of perfect defense usually gets you -- a scoreless tie. 
</P>
<P>
 That won't win a playoff game, so the Canucks went looking for the Toronto net 
as regulation time ran down. Cliff Ronning found it with the only goal needed, 
and Pavel Bure added an empty-net score in Vancouver's 2-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 That gave the Canucks a 3-1 lead in the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronning took a return pass from Sergio Momesso and beat goaltender Felix 
Potvin at 17:35 of the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 "Serg and I like the give-and-go game," Ronning said. "We're definitely not 
superstars on our line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important for our hockey club to realize we have to take it a period at 
a time. We went with our forecheck in the third, and I think that's why we 
ended up winning the hockey game." 
</P>
<P>
 The finish seemed so sudden after a long evening of pressure-packed defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cliff Ronning found a little opening and that ended it," Toronto Coach Pat 
Burns said. "There wasn't much room out there, and whoever found the opening 
won it. They got one good one and put it away." 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver goaltender Kirk McLean recorded his second consecutive shutout and 
tied an NHL record with his fourth of the playoffs by stopping 29 shots. McLean 
hasn't allowed a goal in 135 minutes 23 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 He was sharp in the opening period when the Maple Leafs outshot Vancouver, 
11-7. Toronto had the better chances while outshooting Vancouver, 9-4, in the 
second period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks can win the best-of-seven series with a victory in Game 5 Tuesday 
at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a huge win for our club," Ronning said of Sunday's game. "We still have 
to win one more game to get to where we all dream about playing," the NHL 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver hasn't been in the finals since 1982.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Now Michael Jordan has a challenge. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He can return to the Chicago Bulls and try to bring them their fourth NBA 
title in five years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls had a successful season, but it might have lasted longer if Jordan 
had been playing basketball in Madison Square Garden Sunday instead of baseball 
in Huntsville, Ala., where his batting average dropped to .221. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This was another ugly NBA game badly in need of someone, such as Jordan, 
capable of putting the ball in the net. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Tough defense had something to do with the lousy field goal shooting 
percentages, but how do you explain New York's 60% and Chicago's 52% free-throw 
shooting? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Before dismissing the home-court advantage again, consider that each Game 7 of 
the three conference semifinal series that went that far was won by 10 points 
by the home team. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I love Hakeem Olajuwon's style. He plays the game hard and cleanly and never 
showboats. He is a throwback to Bill Russell. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Houston Rocket center should enjoy another big series against Utah, which 
is nearly as unimposing in the middle as Phoenix. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Atlanta Hawks might still be in the playoffs if they had Dominique Wilkins 
-- the scorer they needed against the Indiana Pacers -- instead of Danny 
Manning. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Understatement of the day from NBC's Bob Costas during the draft lottery show: 
"Glenn Robinson is perhaps the top pick." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 So much for the suspicion that somehow, some way, the Lakers or Boston Celtics 
would get one of the top three picks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The difference between NBA and NHL officiating is that the basketball whistle 
blowers aren't afraid to decide a game with a call in the last minute. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle Supersonic assistant Tim Grgurich, who served under Jerry Tarkanian at 
Nevada Las Vegas, would make a good choice to fill one of the NBA openings. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers showed they are legit by taking two out of three from the Reds in 
Cincinnati. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It is one thing to beat up on San Diego and Colorado and another to win a 
series on the road from the team that had the best home record in the National 
League. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Most encouraging were the three good performances by starting pitchers Tom 
Candiotti, Ramon Martinez and Pedro Astacio. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure which is a better example of the souped-up baseball, Brett 
Butler's three home runs or Ken Griffey's 20 home runs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 They have been hitting fools, but I don't think the Dodgers can afford to have 
Mike Piazza's bat out of the lineup every five games on days when Candiotti is 
pitching. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Now they can concentrate on baseball in Chicago. The Cubs, who open a 
three-game series tonight at Dodger Stadium, have won six in a row and the 
White Sox six out of seven. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The average number of runs scored by winning teams in the American League 
Friday night was 10.7. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's averages showed only one AL team, the White Sox, with an earned run 
average less than 4.00. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 San Diego Padre right fielder Tony Gwynn on players who are unhappy with their 
contracts: "Hey, 109 (minimum wage of $109,000) is a lot of money. I'm sure 
most fans who come to the ballpark would be delighted to be making 109." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Capriati's troubles revive the belief that 17 should be made the 
minimum age for professional tennis players. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Remember when Oregon was a track and field power? The Ducks finished eighth, 
far behind campion UCLA and runner-up USC, in the Pacific-10 Conference men's 
meet. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The next King general manager should give Rogie Vachon more to do. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Tabasco Cat's victory in the Preakness might be the start of a big year for 
Wayne Lukas, who has a number of promising 2-year-olds in his barn. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 When I saw the replay of the Kentucky Derby during the Preakness telecast, I 
gave Tabasco Cat a lot better chance to win Saturday. He wasn't ready for the 
start of the Derby and then got pinched. No such bad luck in Baltimore. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-year-old picture remains scrambled and probably won't be settled until 
races much later in the year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Look for an announcement this week that the Riddick Bowe-Larry Donald 
heavyweight bout will be held July 15 at Hollywood Park. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Angel broadcaster Bob Starr, expressing surprise that there was activity in 
the Kansas City Royal bullpen during the eighth inning of David Cone's 
one-hitter and third consecutive shutout: "The way he's pitching, the bullpen 
could be on the bus going to the airport."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; GRIFFEY TIES MANTLE'S RECORD WITH 20TH HOMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ken Griffey Jr. tied Mickey Mantle's record for most home runs in the first 
two months of the season, hitting his 20th as the Seattle Mariners completed a 
four-game sweep of the Texas Rangers with an 8-2 victory Sunday night at 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey's 20 homers in 42 games matched Mantle's 20 homers in 41 games in the 
first two months of the 1956 season when Mantle hit 52. The Mariners have eight 
more games left this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey's 13th homer in May gave him 152 for his six-year career, tying the 
total that his father hit from 1973 through 1991 with four different teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey, who tied a major league record by hitting home runs in eight straight 
games last season, homered in his third game in a row. He has he eight homers 
in nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Sojo also hit a homer and Roger Salkeld (2-2) pitched five shutout 
innings for the Mariners, who outscored the Rangers, 45-10, in the series. The 
Mariners won, 19-2, on Friday and 13-2 on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers' Juan Gonzalez collided with third baseman Dean Palmer while 
catching a foul ball in the first inning and left the game in the fourth with a 
bruised left shin and thigh. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 9, Milwaukee 6 -- Travis Fryman and rookie Chris Gomez each went three 
for four with a home run at Detroit as the Tigers handed the Brewers their 11th 
consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez's homer was his fifth of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brewers' skid is the second-longest in club history and one shy of the 
club record set in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 During its slump, Milwaukee is batting .232, and the pitching staff has given 
up 128 hits and 66 walks. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Dodger Tim Belcher (2-7) gave up four runs and six hits in 5 2/3 
innings for his second victory in a row and first at home after starting the 
year 0-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Vaughn, who was four for 30 before Sunday, hit two homers for the 
Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 5, Oakland 2 -- Frank Thomas drove in two runs to give the White Sox a 
victory and a sweep of their three-game series with the Athletics at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Bere (5-1) allowed one run over six-plus innings to win his third 
consecutive start for the White Sox, who have won six of their last seven. 
</P>
<P>
 The A's, who were swept for the ninth time this season, have lost six in a row 
and 27 of their last 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 8, Toronto 0 -- Dennis Martinez pitched a seven-hit shutout as the 
Indians snapped a seven-game road losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez (3-4) struck out three and walked three for his first shutout this 
season and the 24th of his career. Martinez allowed only two runners to reach 
second base. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Belle homered and drove in two runs for the Indians, who won their 
first road game since May 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 9, Minnesota 2 -- Roger Clemens limited the Twins to five hits in eight 
innings at Minneapolis as the Red Sox stopped the Twins' winning streak at 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemens (5-2), who has allowed only eight earned runs in 61 innings in his 
last eight starts, walked four and struck out seven in handing the Twins their 
first home loss in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 6, New York 5 -- Jack Voigt's two-run single capped a two-out, 
10th-inning rally as the Orioles won at New York to snap the Yankees' nine-game 
home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 With two outs in the 10th, Harold Baines singled off Xavier Hernandez (2-2) 
and Leo Gomez doubled. Voigt singled in pinch-runner Lonnie Smith and Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael Palmeiro extended his hitting streak to 24 games.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; CARDINAL PITCHER HITS MARLIN, BRAWL FOLLOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a wild second-inning brawl between the Florida Marlins and St. Louis 
Cardinals Sunday at Miami, even umpire Charlie Relford was hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals scored four runs in the top of the ninth, including two on a 
double by Gregg Jefferies, to win the game, 10-9. 
</P>
<P>
 The brawl started after Jeff Conine hit Florida's third homer of the inning 
off Allen Watson and the Cardinal pitcher hit the next batter, Orestes 
Destrade, on the left shoulder with a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Destrade, who had a two-run double in the first inning, charged the mound. 
Watson threw his glove at Destrade's face, opening a cut on the bridge of his 
nose. Destrade then landed a solid punch to Watson's face and the benches 
emptied. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ensuing melee, Cardinal left fielder Bernard Gilkey and Marlin reliever 
Luis Aquino tangled, with Gilkey accidentally landing a punch on the back of 
Relford's head. 
</P>
<P>
 Destrade and Aquino of the Marlins and Watson and Gilkey of the Cardinals were 
ejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got a kid out of college trying to play like he's in the big leagues," 
Destrade said of Watson. "Basically, he's a little wimpy college boy." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, who was an All-American at New York Institute of Technology in 1991, 
said: "I threw inside trying to get him off the plate but it ran too much. I 
knew he was going to charge and I wasn't going to stand there and get my head 
kicked in." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 7, Houston 6 -- The Padres' club-record 13-game losing steak is 
over. Phil Plantier hit a two-run homer in the eighth inning at Houston to give 
San Diego a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Shipley led off the eighth inning with a single and, two outs later, 
Plantier homered to right off Mitch Williams (1-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Gonzalez hit a two-out, two-run double off reliever Pedro Martinez (1-1) 
in the seventh inning to give the Astros a 6-5 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 6, San Francisco 5 -- Derrick May hit a leadoff homer in the 11th 
inning at Chicago to give the Cubs their sixth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Cub starter Anthony Young gave up six hits in seven innings and left with a 
5-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 8, Colorado 3 -- Greg Maddux struck out nine batters in seven innings 
at Denver as the Braves extended their two-year record against the Rockies to 
16-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves swept the three-game series and handed the Rockies their fifth 
consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 3, Pittsburgh 2 -- Expo pitcher Pedro Martinez got his first major 
league hit in 23 at-bats, tripling in the fourth inning to knock in three runs 
at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Pirate starter Denny Neagle also got his first big-league hit, a fifth-inning 
single to snap an 0-for-40 streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez's triple, a medium-range fly to right-center, fell between a sliding 
Andy Van Slyke and right fielder Dave Clark, who were playing unusually 
shallow. 
</P>
<P>
 Expo Manager Felipe Alou said, "They were playing him shallow because he was 0 
for lifetime. . . . Was I surprised he hit it that far? I was surprised he hit 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez (3-3) gave up homers by Van Slyke and Tom Foley. He knocked down the 
batters that followed them, Jeff King and Don Slaught, but there were no 
incidents.  
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 8, New York 3 -- Lenny Dykstra, Pete Incaviglia and Darren 
Daulton each led off innings with home runs as the Phillies routed the Mets at 
Philadelphia to sweep a three-game series.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; LACHEMANN PROVING A QUIET LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angel pitching staff was expected to welcome Marcel Lachemann with open 
arms, but the pitchers aren't the only ones thriving under the new manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's brought in this aura of quiet confidence, I guess that's the best way I 
can put it," said Rex Hudler, who has two home runs and two doubles in the two 
games he has played under Lachemann. "He's into preparation and fundamentals 
and, as far as I'm concerned, that's great. He had us out at 3 o'clock 
(Saturday) working on rundowns. And he's on the field while we're stretching. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not taking anything away from Buck (Rodgers). Buck had his own style. But 
(Lachemann) is a quiet leader. It's just the way he carries himself. And, so 
far, he's made all the right moves with the pitchers. All of sudden, our staff 
looks like a Cy Young group. (Saturday), Phil Leftwich looked like Lefty 
Grove." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Langston lasted only 5 2/3 innings Sunday, but said he felt stronger than 
he has since returning to the rotation after undergoing elbow surgery April 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time I lose, I'm disappointed," Langston said, "but I felt great when 
(Lachemann) took me out in the sixth and I couldn't have said that after the 
other two starts." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston struggled in the early going, but appeared to have found a groove 
when he struck out the side in the fifth before giving up four consecutive 
singles in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once he started getting the breaking ball down, he started to look like the 
Mark Langston of old," Lachemann said. "I mean it's not that long ago that he 
had surgery, so I think that's pretty impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The home run that (Terry) Shumpert hit was off a good pitch, the one that 
David (Henderson) hit was out over the plate. The rest of the hits were pretty 
much just ground balls in the hole."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The much-maligned bullpen has been a key to the Angels' recent success at 
home. Relievers were 1-1 with three saves and a combined 2.57 earned-run 
average during the homestand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a very encouraging last few days," outfielder Tim Salmon said, 
"especially when you consider the pitching and the way (John) Dopson pitched 
(Sunday) and (Mark) Leiter the other day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going out on the road, it's a good feeling to have the bullpen going like 
this." JOHN WEYLER

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; HIS MOTTO: BETTER LATE THAN NEVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He has been released four times in the last 16 months and was once bought by 
the Milwaukee Brewers for $2,500 and 12 dozen baseballs, but Tim Fortugno, 32, 
hopes those struggles are long gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how someone with his ability fell through the cracks," said Jim 
Bowden, the Cincinnati Reds' general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortugno, a left-handed reliever with a good curveball and 92 m.p.h. fastball, 
was released by the Angels before the 1993 season. He was on his way to joining 
the San Bernardino Spirit in April when the Reds signed him to a double-A 
contract. He was called up May 13 and was told it would be a short stay. But 
Fortugno has given up only one hit in four appearances and 4.2 innings, 
including two against the Dodgers, and the Reds sent down Jerry Spradlin 
instead.  
</P>
<P>
 Fortugno started pitching late in his career, while attending Southern 
California College in Costa Mesa. He was 25 during his first minor league 
season. "Everything has its time, and maybe mine is later," Fortugno said. 
"Hopefully, it means I have a lot of years left in this arm because it hasn't 
been used that much." MARYANN HUDSON

GOLF ROUNDUP; LEHMAN MAINTAINS PACE FOR FIRST TOUR VICTORY 
</P>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Lehman wasn't going to coast. With a four-shot lead before his first swing 
at Muirfield Village Golf Club on Sunday, he had decided he would go for broke. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole game plan was to torch the front nine, go for every pin," Lehman 
said. "I wanted to try to lap the field." 
</P>
<P>
 He nearly did. Lehman shot his fourth consecutive five-under 67 for a 
tournament-record 20-under 268 and a five-shot victory in the Memorial at 
Dublin, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a weekend tournament host Jack Nicklaus called "unbelievable," and it 
erased the stigma of Lehman's not having won on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 It also helped salve his misery at losing the Masters after leading through 
three rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 His lead Sunday was never less than three shots, occasionally up to eight. 
Greg Norman was second. 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman, eyes tearing and voice breaking, held his daughters, Rachel and Holly, 
in his arms as he called his victory "a thrill beyond belief. It is one of the 
greatest days of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 He was the 20th different winner in as many tournaments this year, the deepest 
the tour has gone in a schedule without producing a double winner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Floyd entered the day with a five-shot lead, then blew all but one of 
the strokes in shooting a two-over 74 to finish at 206, edging Bob Murphy and 
Gary Player in the Cadillac NFL Golf Classic in Clifton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd had to par the final hole for the PGA Senior Tour victory. 
</P>
<P>
 He sent his drive way right on No. 18 while Murphy, playing in the group ahead 
of him, missed a five-foot birdie attempt that would have tied him for the 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd then hit a sand wedge, two-iron, 60-degree wedge and putt for his 
scrambled par.

 The Cal State Northridge and UCLA softball teams advanced to the College World 
Series by winning regionals on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 It took a few hours longer than expected, but Northridge defeated Cal State 
Fullerton, 4-0, at home Sunday in the Region 3 final to earn a trip to Oklahoma 
City May 26-30, for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 Trinity Johnson had a two-hitter as Fullerton (35-29) beat Northridge, 2-0, in

ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH / SPECIAL REPORT: GENERATION X 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 BOOMING BUSTERS: Whether they're called Generation X, twentysomethings or the 
13th Generation, young adults born after the baby boom of the 1950s are an 
emerging presence in Orange County. Generally born during a time of declining 
birthrate, between 1962 and 1975, Generation Xers made up 28% of the county's 
population in the 1990 Census. . . . Chapman University sociology professor 
Karl Reitz points to the high cost of living, attracting fewer retirees. Also, 
"younger people are probably coming here for high-tech jobs," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 GENERACION EQUIS: Latino twentysomethings have changed the face of the county 
in the past decade -- their numbers doubled from about 90,000 in 1980 to more 
than 209,000 in 1990. . . . "The new generation is the Latino generation in 
Santa Ana," says Rueben Martinez, Santa Ana bookseller and barber. They range 
from assimilated teens who favor grunge rock to recent Mexican immigrants who 
prefer Banda music. Martinez has seen second- and third-generation Latinos who 
speak poor Spanish "coming back to learn their culture." 
</P>
<P>
 McJOB MARKET: A Generation X stereotype: Young adults take jobs grilling 
hamburgers, even after earning college degrees. . . . But economists have said 
hiring may soon be increasing. At UC Irvine, 10% to 15% more corporate 
recruiters visited campus this spring than last, says Thomas A. Parham, 
director of the Career Planning and Placement Center. "If you measure how 
things are now to how they were five years ago, they're still not good," he 
says. "But compared to 1993 and 1992, it's slightly better." 
</P>
<P>
 SURF'S UP: Young Xers are taking to the water these days, according to the 
Surf Industry Manufacturers Assn. in Corona del Mar. "Most surfers are between 
18 and 23 years old," the association's Michael Kingsbury says. His group will 
sponsor the fifth annual Waterman's Ball -- the social event of the season for 
young surfers in Orange County -- to raise money for ocean conservation. Those 
with $100 to spare can attend the dinner June 4 at the California Scenario 
Sculpture Garden near South Coast Plaza.

ROBERT VOSPER; LED GROWTH OF UCLA LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Gordon Vosper, the venerated UCLA librarian who is credited with 
directing the growth and direction of the university's volumes into what is 
acknowledged today as a world-class collection, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Westwood university said Vosper died at his Los Angeles 
home May 14.He was 80 and directed the school library from 1961 until his 
retirement in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Chancellor Charles E. Young said Vosper had been handpicked for the top 
library position by former Chancellor Franklin D. Murphy to succeed Lawrence 
Clark Powell, who established a national reputation for the UCLA library. 
Murphy knew Vosper from the University of Kansas when Murphy was chancellor 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said Vosper took Powell's legacy and developed it into one of the top 
five university research libraries in North America with more than 6 million 
volumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Vosper presided over the dedication of the university research library in 1966 
and the addition of a second wing in 1971. For those accomplishments and others 
he was named UCLA Man of the Year in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 Vosper is survived by his wife, Loraine, four children and eight 
grandchildren.

D. NEUMANN; A MAINSTAY OF FAMED THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dorothy Neumann, veteran character actress and one of four principals in Los 
Angeles' storied Turnabout Theater, has died at the age of 80. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Neumann died Friday in Santa Monica Hospital of pulmonary complications, 
her friend, Robert Hoover, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual theater, subject of a 1993 documentary titled "Turnabout," 
flourished on La Cienega Boulevard from 1941 to 1956. Miss Neumann performed in 
and directed revues for the three men who founded Turnabout -- puppeteer Harry 
Burnett, who died last year, business manager Roddy Brandon, who died in 1985, 
and composer and lyricist Forman Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater got its name because it had stages at both ends of the auditorium 
filled with reversible old streetcar seats. First a puppet show was presented 
on one stage, and then the audience was ordered to "turn about" for a live 
musical revue on the other stage. Miss Neumann was a mainstay of the revue, 
often headlined by Elsa Lanchester. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Neumann, who appeared in some 60 films, studied theater arts at Carnegie 
Institute and earned a master's degree at Yale's highly respected drama school. 
</P>
<P>
 As versatile as her Turnabout counterparts, she designed costumes, painted 
scenery, built marionettes, wrote plays, and produced and acted in them. She 
spent several summers teaching in a theater program in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 She is survived by a niece, Jacqueline Lacey, of Encinitas, and two 
great-nephews.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGIONAL BASEBALL PLAYOFFS; CYPRESS WINS, GAINS BERTH IN 
STATE TOURNAMENT 
</P>

 Kari Pickler, daughter of Cypress Coach Scott Pickler, had two things to say 
after her dad's team beat Cuesta, 14-4, in a Southern California baseball 
playoff final Sunday at Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 First she congratulated him on the victory and the berth in the State 
tournament. She also had a bit of advice for him: "Don't get your hair cut too 
short or it will never grow back." 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later, Pickler and his assistants Bill Pinkham, Ron Hall and Ron 
Hauczinger got buzz cuts at the hands of the players to pay off a bet made 
about six weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's worth it," Pickler said. "I'm excited. There are four teams still 
playing and 80 that are not." 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress, the Orange Empire Conference champion, will be joined by Rancho 
Santiago, the third-place team from the same conference, in the tournament 
starting Saturday at Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the third time in four years that both Southern California 
representatives have come from the Orange Empire Conference. Cypress won the 
title in 1991 and Rancho Santiago won it last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Things started quickly for Cypress, the designated visitor. Leadoff hitter 
Augie Ojeda walked. Israel Gonzalez singled and Jason Hodges followed with a 
three-run homer, his 14th and a Cypress single-season record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to say (the record) wasn't on my mind," Hodges said. "But it was . . 
. It's nice to be going to the State tournament. I'd trade all my home runs for 
a ring next weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Kliner hit a three-run home run in the third as Cypress opened a 7-1 
lead. The Chargers added three in the fifth and four in the sixth to go ahead, 
14-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojeda, Kliner, Hodges and Mark Selway each drove in three runs for the 
Chargers (39-10). 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Hendren (10-2) came up with another in a series of strong pitching 
performances for Cypress. He gave up eight hits and four runs in eight innings. 
Hendren, who made an oral commitment to Arizona on Saturday, struck out nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Crabtree, who hadn't pitched in about six weeks because of an arm injury, 
worked a perfect ninth, striking out two.

RUNS, ERRORS ADD UP TO VICTORY FOR RANCHO SANTIAGO

 Rancho Santiago used two three-run innings and four Citrus errors to beat the 
Owls, 6-4, in the Southern California baseball playoffs Sunday at Los Angeles 
Harbor College. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory marks the third time in seven years the Dons (38-11) have advanced 
to the State tournament, which starts Saturday at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it's a brand new season," Rancho Santiago Coach Don Sneddon said. "We 
were the dark horse as the 10th seed. We're kind of like the uninvited guest 
who's there to give a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Kirk Irvine (8-1) held the Owl bats in check, striking out eight and 
allowing four earned runs and eight hits in 7 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just trying to throw strikes," Irvine said. "My fastball was not as 
hard as I wanted. I was trying to stay mellow and not let the emotion get the 
best of me. It was tough." 
</P>
<P>
 "(Citrus) is one of the finest hitting clubs," Sneddon said. "Irvine did a 
great job to hold them to only four runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to attack their defense because we knew they were struggling, so we 
got some bunts down." 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago fell behind in the third inning, when Citrus (36-7) scored 
three runs on four hits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons answered in the bottom of the third, scoring three unearned runs 
without managing a hit. Citrus pitcher Isaac Hernandez threw away Joe Fraser's 
sacrifice bunt attempt, scoring Corey Doll and Matt Kastelic. Daryle Ward 
followed with a sacrifice fly to score Fraser from third and tie it, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago jumped ahead for good in the bottom of the fourth, scoring 
three runs on three hits. Doll singled to score Jamie Estrada and scored on a 
balk one out later. Darren Troilo singled to drive in Kastelic with the Dons' 
final run of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine got out of a jam in the sixth, allowing only one run, and settled down 
until the eighth. With two outs in the eighth, Irvine gave up a double and a 
walk before being replaced by Brian Martineau. Martineau struck out Bob 
Antillon to end the threat and retired the side in the ninth for his third save 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Kastelic had three hits and scored twice, and Doll had one hit and two runs 
scored for the Dons.

NCAA SOFTBALL REGIONALS; TITANS FALL ONE VICTORY SHORT OF WORLD SERIES; 
TOURNAMENT: CAL STATE FULLERTON WINS THE FIRST GAME, 2-0, BUT CAL STATE 
NORTHRIDGE WINS BERTH WITH A 4-0 DECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Cal State Fullerton's surprising bid for a berth in the college softball World 
Series was only one victory away Sunday, but then the Titans came face to face 
again with Cal State Northridge pitcher Amy Windmiller. 
</P>
<P>
 That hasn't been a pleasant experience for any team this season, much less one 
with an NCAA regional championship on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Windmiller, beaten only twice in 26 games this season, continued to work her 
magic Sunday, giving up only three hits, and Northridge came alive on offense 
with 11 hits to turn back the Titans, 4-0. Northridge, 49-8 and ranked third in 
the nation, moves on to the World Series beginning Thursday in Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just can't seem to get a run off Windmiller," Fullerton Coach Judi Garman 
said. "She's been the key for them, although you have to give them credit. They 
beat us with their bats as well as her pitching." 
</P>
<P>
 Windmiller, who has the best earned-run average in the nation at 0.29, shut 
out Fullerton three consecutive times this season, including a three-hit, 9-0 
victory in Saturday's regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Garman, whose Titans won the first game, 2-0, behind the two-hit pitching of 
freshman Trinity Johnson, came back with Johnson as the starter in the second 
game. But Northridge found the range against Johnson early. She got out of the 
first two innings without giving up a run, although Northridge threatened in 
both, but the Matadors loaded the bases with none out in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was starting to get a little tired in the third," Johnson said. "I was 
trying to give 100% as long as I could." 
</P>
<P>
 In the third, Jen Fleming singled up the middle, advanced when Beth Calcante 
was safe on a sacrifice bunt attempt, and moved to third on Tamara Ivie's 
single. At that point, Garman brought in Jennifer Mortensen, winner in the 
first game of the regional against Washington but who had been beaten by 
Northridge on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortensen almost escaped without giving up a run. She struck out power-hitting 
Scia Maumausolo, and Shannon Jones bounced out to third, forcing Fleming at 
home, but Jennifer Parker doubled to deep left, scoring two runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge built the lead to 4-0 in the fourth when Fleming connected for a 
two-run homer after Terri Pearson had reached base on an error. That was more 
of a lead than Windmiller would need. She had scattered three hits in the first 
four innings, then put the Titans down in order in the last three. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really proud of this team," Garman said. "They really fought back at the 
end of the season. We came a lot farther than anyone expected. . . . I'm so 
proud of the way the team played here, especially in the first game (Sunday)." 
</P>
<P>
 In that game, Fullerton pushed across its two runs in the fifth to win. Laurie 
LoForti singled, and was safe at second on Christina Wagy's infield bouncer. 
Both runners advanced on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on another bunt when the 
Matador catcher, Maumausolo, had trouble handling a high throw from Jones, the 
third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans (35-29), who began the tournament ranked 20th, won 18 of their last 
22 games.

 Cal Lutheran won the first two games of the series and entered Sunday's games 
with a 2-1 lead.The Kingsmen lost the first game Sunday, 11-3, setting the 
stage for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran scored three runs in the seventh inning of the final game to take 
a 5-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in the bottom of the inning, shortstop Ed Castillo made a bad throw on 
what would have been a force play at second. The next batter hit a soft bouncer 
up the middle that glanced off pitcher Marc Weiss' glove. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the inning ended, fourth-ranked San Diego (31-6) had scored six 
unearned runs.

UAL, UNION REVISE ACCORD ON BUYOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD M. WEINTRAUB, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 United Airlines and its pilots union agreed Sunday to revise a buyout accord 
under which the airline's employees will become majority owners of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, members of the Air Line Pilots Assn., the International 
Assn. of Machinists and salaried and management employee groups get a new 
formula for ensuring the longer-term value of their wages, benefits and 
work-rule concessions, which are worth more than $4.5 billion. Shareholders 
will be guaranteed a certain amount for their stock through an underwriting 
financed by UAL Corp., the holding company for the airline. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal was designed to smooth over discontent that emerged when the price of 
the company's stock plummeted in recent weeks amid turmoil in the stock and 
bond markets. The stock, which hit a 52-week low of $117.75 a share on May 16, 
closed Friday at $119.375. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, which must be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, is 
expected to be presented to shareholders for a vote next month. 
</P>
<P>
 After the deal is approved and all existing shares of UAL are tendered, a new 
stock will be created. Under the plan reached Sunday, unions will get a 55% 
share in the company instead of a 53% share in the original proposal. The 
unions will be able to increase the stake to 63% if the "new" UAL stock reaches 
$74.55 within a year instead of $89.22 under the original proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal will give the company flexibility to operate a low-cost "airline 
within the airline" to better compete against Southwest Airlines and other 
low-cost imitators. 
</P>
<P>
 "These changes work for our shareholders and will help ensure that United 
becomes competitive in the aviation marketplace," said Steven Wolf, United's 
chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 The last-minute maneuvering is the latest twist in a deal that is expected to 
make United the nation's largest employee-owned company and the first of its 
size to take that step while in relatively healthy financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
 United's drive toward employee ownership was slowed when its stock dropped 
below a level at which unions, by some interpretations, had the option of 
walking away from the deal. The declining stock price gave new ammunition to 
dissidents within the pilots union who had fought the deal from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilots union leadership went back to the company a week ago seeking an 
adjustment in some financial conditions to insure the employee stake. The 
company, meanwhile, was concerned about the erosion in the return for 
shareholders under the original agreement, which had called for shareholders to 
receive a mix of cash, debt and preferred stock totaling $88 a share.

STREET SMART: MOTORIST SAYS ABSENCE OF MERGE ARROWS POINTS TO A SAFETY HAZARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I would like your assistance in correcting a safety problem that I see almost 
daily. This occurs with northbound traffic on Harbor Boulevard after the 
intersection of Bastanchury Road in Fullerton.  
</P>
<P>
 Harbor Boulevard has three lanes coming out of the intersection, then merges 
into two lanes. While there is a standard merging sign posted some distance 
from the intersection, there are no customary arrows on the pavement indicating 
merging lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 What I constantly see is a race by the curb-lane cars to merge from the right 
to cut into the second lane either by choice or by failure to see the yellow 
traffic merging sign. Before there is a serious accident here, could you please 
call this to the attention of the proper authority? 
</P>
<P>
 Marv Gonsior Fullerton Paul Smith, traffic engineer for the city of Fullerton, 
said he thought arrows were painted on Harbor Boulevard to indicate merging 
lanes after the Bastanchury intersection. Typically, painted arrows accompany 
posted road side signs, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Whether the painted arrows faded or were never there, Smith agrees that arrows 
should be there and his department will investigate. He encourages you to call 
him later this week to find out the results of this investigation. The phone 
number for Fullerton's traffic engineering department is (714) 738-6845. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 When turning from a single left-turn lane to a street with multiple lanes, am 
I restricted as to which lane I can turn to? My niece in Milwaukee says she 
failed her driver's test because she turned to the right lane rather than the 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought it was legal to turn to any lane. What is the law in California?  
</P>
<P>
 Dave Kraus Fountain Valley You are right. The state law says if you are in a 
single left-turn lane, you can turn into any lane of a multiple-lane street as 
long as it is safe, said Bill Madison, a spokesman for the California 
Department of Motor Vehicles in Sacramento.  
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to ask why ramp meters stay on and cycle when traffic is moving 
at 55 m.p.h. or above. I know that Caltrans will say that it improves traffic 
flow; however, these lights' being on when traffic is moving at 55 m.p.h. or 
more actually impedes traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 So many of these ramp meters are so far onto the ramp that when one must stop, 
and then re-accelerate to 55 m.p.h., it causes a backup because that person is 
not going the rate that the rest of the traffic is going. To prove this point, 
see the northbound Katella or Lincoln avenues on-ramps to the Costa Mesa 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Another prime example is the eastbound Imperial Highway on-ramp to the 
Riverside Freeway. Most often, these meters are too close to the freeway 
traffic flow, which (is impeded by) people who stopped at the meter and then 
could not re-accelerate to the rate of the other drivers on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an accident waiting to happen. If traffic flow is below full highway 
speeds, then they work great. But if the speeds on the freeway climb above 55 
m.p.h., they should automatically shut off.  
</P>
<P>
 Matthew Lahr Orange As you predicted, Caltrans does not agree with you. Rose 
Orem, a spokeswoman for Caltrans, said that agency does not believe the 
locations of meters and length of acceleration lanes create a dangerous 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramp meters are set to go on when freeway traffic reaches a high volume, which 
usually means that it also slows. When the volume drops (and speeds normally 
increase), the meters automatically shut off. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the placement of the meters near the freeway, Orem said that allows the 
most number of cars on the ramp at a time, avoiding a backup to the street. 
</P>

 The Orange County Transportation Authority's board of directors is expected to 
give final approval today to a plan to accommodate the growing demands for 
transportation for people with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan eliminates some Dial-A-Ride services for able-bodied senior citizens, 
but maintains group service to senior citizen centers for nutrition and adult 
day health care programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Also approved was an increase in OCTA ACCESS fares from $1.50 to $2 per ride. 
OCTA ACCESS provides door-to-door van service for people with disabilities who 
are unable to use regular, fixed-route buses.

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Recently we had to drive to Northern California in a new car, and wanted to 
check the speedometer using the "measured five-mile" signs on the freeways. 
What we discovered is that there are none on Interstate 5 at all and all the 
signs on California 99 are just about completely demolished. Returning on 99 we 
saw at least 12 sections between Sacramento and Grapevine and not a single 
section remains intact. 
</P>
<P>
 What agency is responsible for maintaining those signs and why is it so 
deficient? 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Wing, Reseda 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans is responsible for maintaining the signs, but the agency's resources 
in that part of the state are stretched so thin that it is difficult to keep up 
with repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans spokesman Steve Saville said the agency's Fresno office is 
responsible for maintaining state roads from Grapevine in the south to Madera 
County in the north. And as you know, there are some lonely stretches along the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 Saville said treasure hunters often swipe the signs as souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Vast distances mean it might be several weeks before crews can make repairs or 
replace missing signs. Even then, fixing broken speedometer signs often takes a 
back seat to replacing a fallen directional sign or cleaning up a spilled load 
of tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to work from a list of priorities," Saville said. Nonetheless he 
urges motorists to call Caltrans with information about broken or missing 
signs.

 Can you provide an update on when the Whites Canyon Road extension will open 
connecting Soledad Canyon to Sierra Highway in the Santa Clarita Valley? The 
road looks complete and is desperately needed to relieve congestion in Canyon 
Country. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Shifflett, Valencia 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 You and scores of other motorists will be happy to know that ribbon-cutting 
for the Whites Canyon-Via Princessa extension is scheduled in just two weeks -- 
June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening will culminate a project that began back in September, 1992. It 
extends the infamous Whites Canyon "bridge to nowhere" -- which for a long 
while dead-ended over the middle of the Santa Clara River -- to Via Princessa, 
which connects to Rainbow Glen Drive on the west and Sierra Highway to the 
east. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County and Santa Clarita officials had originally hoped to open 
the road at the end of April, but earthquake damage to a bridge over the 
railroad tracks south of the river set the project back several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the June 7 opening is still ahead of schedule, says Marty Saine, 
project manager with the Simi Valley-based contractor C. A. Rasmussen. The 
$10.2-million project contract allowed for opening of the extension in 
November, Saine said.

 Every morning on the way to work, I pass through an intersection in Woodland 
Hills that is driving me, and I am sure many other drivers, crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 The intersection is Corbin Avenue and Ventura Boulevard. I must wait an 
interminable length of time to turn left onto eastbound Ventura from southbound 
Corbin. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6:15 a.m., there are not very many cars traveling on Ventura, yet the 
sensors buried in the street on Corbin do not respond to the traffic. 
Frequently, I see motorists cutting through the mini-mall on the corner just so 
they will not have to wait for the light. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the city's story on why the sensors do not work at this intersection? 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Anthony, Canoga Park 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The city's story, according to traffic engineer Brian Gallagher, is that the 
sensors are working fine at that intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 The wait you experience at the light has nothing to do with the sensors but 
rather the cycle of the signal, which itself is regulated by a master timing 
system along the length of Ventura known as the Automated Traffic Surveillance 
and Control system. ATSAC uses closed-circuit television cameras and pavement 
sensors to monitor streets and synchronize signals. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Ventura Boulevard is a main east-west thoroughfare, the signals favor 
Ventura traffic, especially during rush hour. When you arrive at the Corbin 
intersection each morning, you run up against that heavy favoritism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right around 6:15, the morning rush hour starts, and we need to have the 
timing in on Ventura Boulevard a little before that so it can handle all the 
traffic once it gets there," Gallagher says. "Otherwise, we'll have a lot of 
backups we can't get rid of for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 The big picture is the important thing. You may not see many cars whiz by 
Corbin right then, but that is just one intersection out of dozens, and signal 
timing must be in sync all along Ventura for traffic to flow properly from one 
end of the San Fernando Valley to the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we treat each intersection specially, it might be good for one or two side 
streets like Corbin, (but) it'd be horrible" for the rest of the motorists 
along Ventura, Gallagher says.

VALLEY CHRONICLE: ONE MAN'S PASSION FOR CACTUS BLOOMS INTO THRIVING BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For David Bernstein, cacti and succulents are not just plants, but a passion. 
His Cactus Ranch in Reseda has more than 100,000 plants, many now in bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch is a high school agriculture project that has grown into a lucrative 
business, according to the 36-year-old horticultural entrepreneur who supplies 
plants to retailers and landscape architects all over Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 On weekends he opens his not-so-secret garden, located on Saticoy Street, to 
tour buses and the curious. He says he didn't mean to become an underground 
tourist attraction. People saw what looked like a huge, xeriscape garden and 
wanted to know if they could come and look at it. 
</P>
<P>
 He says his spread is rivaled only by the formal cactus and succulent garden 
at the Huntington Library in San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 The outdoor displays feature an amazing diversity of plants side-by-side with 
20-foot giants. Now almost all have flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that fascinates me is how such beautiful, delicate blooms 
can come from such prickly, grizzled plants," Bernstein says. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein became a green grower his junior year at James Monroe High School. 
"I was a serious agriculture student thrown in with about 200 people who were 
in the program just marking time," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "My teacher, Jack Yost, could tell I wanted to learn, so the summer of my 
junior year he gave me the keys to the school greenhouse, and told me I could 
grow whatever I wanted," Bernstein remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Yost's supervision, Bernstein collected about 1,000 cuttings donated by 
the plant nursery where he then worked, and he began growing them in the 
greenhouse. They were mostly houseplants like grape ivy and creeping charlies, 
with some succulents thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
 After high school graduation, Bernstein went to Pierce College and studied 
horticulture. He spent summers working at Frank's Nursery on Reseda Boulevard 
in Northridge while becoming more and more fascinated with growing cactus 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time I was using my parents' yard in North Hills to grow the plants 
from seeds to full flower," he says. "So, in addition to working as a clerk at 
Frank's, I became one of his suppliers. That was about the time when people 
started becoming aware of the advantages of landscaping with water-saving 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a while, John Goka, the manager of Frank's, told me to stop coming to 
work and concentrate on supplying plants to his and other nurseries," says 
Bernstein, who then, at the age of 24, bought an acre and a half in Reseda so 
he would have room to spread out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd saved some money and my mother loaned me some to make the $40,000 down 
payment on the property. But I was scared because I still owed the rest of the 
$169,000. Scared but confident. It was something I really wanted to do," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein now travels Monday through Friday to nurseries from San Diego to 
Santa Barbara, not just delivering product and shooting the breeze with his 
customers, but setting up xeriscape displays that show nursery customers how to 
use water-saving plants in landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 On weekends, he's almost always at the Cactus Ranch in Reseda, where he 
wanders among the visitors and sells his plants, which range in price from $1 
to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never meant the ranch to be a retail outlet which would put me in direct 
competition with my commercial customers. But the people I supply to don't 
mind, so I go ahead and sell things if people want them," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein says the seven-day-a-week schedule doesn't bother him. "My 
girlfriend and I go away occasionally. We just got back from Hawaii, where the 
plants are so varied and interesting we were just knocked out," Bernstein adds. 
</P>
<P>
 He says if he sounds like a workaholic, he's giving the wrong impression. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I do every day is fun for me. I feel like I'm goofing off. I see my 
friends in various professions grinding out the long hours and hating every 
minute. For them, the weekends are never long enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, I watch things grow, talk to nice people and make a good living. It's 
my theory that if you do what you love, the money and security will come," he 
says. Bar Stops Serving Free Drinks Because of the Residual Effect 
</P>
<P>
 OK, we all know there is no such thing as a free lunch, right? 
</P>
<P>
 But every writer, director and actor in the Valley knew you could get $5 worth 
of free booze at Re duals bar in Studio City if you brought in a residual check 
for under $1. Sad to say that was then and now is different, for all those 
formerly poor but happy freeloaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners, like the raven, now say "Nevermore." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a joke," says owner-manager Craig Tennis. "How many people would ever 
get such a check?" 
</P>
<P>
 The answer now seems to be, just about everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't say it, but Tennis implies that if he kept paying off he'd end up 
standing outside with a sign that says, "Will work for bar whiskey." 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis used to write for talk show hosts. But he had enough grief when he 
reached the age of 40 and his agent said he should probably hang up his word 
processor. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis and some chums opened Re duals about eight years ago, and it has since 
attracted stars from nearby television and movie studios. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the place Robert DeNiro and Burt Reynolds hoist a quick one. As a 
matter of fact, this was the place Roseanne and Tom Arnold chose for their 
engagement party. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis is usually working evenings and doesn't watch much television, which is 
why he recently wanted to throw out a group of what looked to him like 
teen-agers -- until he was told they were the already carded cast of "Beverly 
Hills 90210." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the help are working actors. 
</P>
<P>
 Waitress Gloria Hylton is in director Garry Marshall's next feature, "Exit to 
Eden." Marshall is a Re duals customer. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartender Mark Robertson has an ongoing part in television's "Burke's Law." 
Bartender Ron Lewis has been cast in the stage sequel to "Tony & Tina's 
Wedding." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care if they have outside jobs as long as they cover their shift," 
Tennis says. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis and his dozen or so co-owners are all in the entertainment business, so 
when they were bouncing around ideas for bar names they decided upon Re duals, 
because, according to Tennis, "it was the word that we could all emotionally 
respond to." 
</P>
<P>
 Residuals are payments that people receive for work they have already done. 
Overheard: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republicans really know their American audience. They figured out that no 
one can figure out Whitewater, so they give us Bimbogate, a nice biblical 
Jim-and-Tammy kind of scandal that no one has to explain."

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; DESPITE GLITCHES, REELECT JACOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 18 years as Orange County assessor, Bradley Jacobs has tried to run his 
office like a business, generally with good results. He has relied extensively 
on computers, stuck to a chain of command in which he reported to the county 
administrative officer, and generally kept a low profile. Most of the time that 
style served him well, but he has had some problems in his current four-year 
term. Despite the glitches, he deserves reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 As assessor, a countywide post, Jacobs oversees a staff of more than 300 who 
appraise all the property in the county subject to taxation. For most 
residential property bought since Proposition 13, it is easy to figure the 
assessment -- 1% of the purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with assessments came in the past few years. Before that, it 
virtually was a certainty that if you bought property in Orange County, it went 
up each year by more than the 2% on an assessment allowed by law. Double-digit 
increases in home values were not unheard of. But in the 1990s, some property 
values declined. And that meant the assessment, and the property tax, also 
should have declined. 
</P>
<P>
 When the taxes did not drop, homeowners screamed. But Orange County had such a 
backlog that the Board of Supervisors was forced to set up another panel to 
hear the appeals. Jacobs should have let the supervisors know earlier, and more 
forcefully, that the real estate slump would mean more appeals. He also should 
have been more active in letting homeowners know that they had a right to 
appeal. Now that the supervisors have given him the additional staff he needed, 
there should be no excuses for falling behind on keeping assessments current. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs is running for yet another term against two weak candidates, both of 
whom work in his office. Whatever misgivings there may be about Jacobs' 
stewardship of the assessments, he has done a respectable job for the county 
and its taxpayers by fighting for the correct assessments of businesses' land, 
buildings, computers and the like. Overall, he has done a solid enough job to 
merit another term.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; BABIES AND MOTHERS -- FREE FROM DRUGS; HEALTH: PREGNANCY 
OFFERS THE BEST OPPORTUNITY TO INTERVENE AND BREAK THE CYCLE OF ADDICTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW M. MECCA, Andrew Mecca is director of the California Department of 
Alcohol and Drug Programs. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Janine just wanted to be a good mother. She started drinking alcohol when she 
was 15 and using methamphetamines when she was 16. She drank to numb the pain 
of a boyfriend's death. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time she was 21, she had a daily alcohol habit and knew she was an 
alcoholic. While pregnant, Janine drank beer and tomato juice with her prenatal 
vitamins. Soon she was drinking up to two cases of beer a day. After going into 
premature labor, Janine's baby arrived -- twin girls, both born with fetal 
alcohol syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Janine, many women will experience the devastating effects of alcohol and 
other drug abuse. Babies that fit in the palm of your hand, with skin too 
fragile to touch, with tubes and needles sticking into their tiny bodies, 
keeping them alive -- premature babies born to addicted mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug abuse touches women of all colors and all economic backgrounds. From 
celebrities to women living on the street, drug abuse knows no boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one out of nine babies in the United States is born to a mother who 
uses alcohol and other drugs while pregnant. In California, that's 69,000 
mothers, or 11% of the state's women. This problem has a staggering economic 
impact when you consider that each drug-exposed child can cost $1 million over 
a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, most of this unnecessary cost can be avoided. For every dollar 
spent on prevention, $30 in return benefits are saved. Prevention, education 
and treatment for women are where the real cost-saving opportunities exist. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, more than $55 million is targeted to fight perinatal substance 
abuse. The governor's Perinatal Alcohol, Drug Treatment and Education program 
has already served more than 8,000 mothers and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Perinatal Substance Abuse Awareness Week 1994 was a time for individual and 
community-based action to recognize intervention and treatment as a solution 
for these women and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 First, preventing this disease before it starts offers the best return on 
investment for taxpaying citizens. Second, there must be equal access to 
comprehensive prenatal health care, including drug treatment, for all women. 
Women who do not receive prenatal care are almost three times more likely to 
use alcohol or other drugs, and three times more likely to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, women need intervention for their drug use, not incarceration. Drug use 
is a public health problem requiring treatment. We need to ensure that 
drug-addicted mothers receive the treatment they need to live a drug-free 
healthy lifestyle for the sake of themselves, their babies and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Perinatal substance abuse is a significant public health problem. Not only 
does it cost taxpayers millions of dollars each year, but the loss of promising 
lives remains even more devastating. Californians can be proud that we are 
leading the nation in providing treatment for these women and their children. 
About 86% of babies born to women in perinatal programs are born alcohol- and 
drug-free, indicating the success of these services. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the American Medical Assn., there is no safe level of alcohol, 
drug or tobacco use during pregnancy. Drinking alcohol while pregnant may 
result in low birth weight, facial defects, small head size, learning and 
behavior problems, or fetal alcohol syndrome. Cocaine use during pregnancy has 
been associated with premature birth and marked neurobehavioral deficiencies in 
the infant. Use of tobacco during pregnancy may increase the risk of low birth 
weight, spontaneous abortion and stillbirth. 
</P>
<P>
 Research indicates that pregnancy offers the best opportunity for 
intervention. Breaking this devastating cycle of addiction could mean freedom 
from the confines of their disease for women like Janine. 
</P>
<P>
 There is hope and help. There are treatment centers in Orange County and 
statewide that can help women from harming themselves and their unborn baby. If 
you are pregnant, give yourself and your unborn baby the gift of life free from 
alcohol and other drug abuse. You deserve a chance to make a difference.

MIKE PENNER: RODGERS SQUEEZED IN JUICED BALL YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The truth shall set you free (especially when you are under contract to manage 
the Angels) and other knowledge gained from the first quarter of a juiced 
baseball season. . .  
</P>
<P>
 -- Buck Rodgers loses his job after 2 1/2 seasons because he is "too candid." 
Tommy Lasorda remains gainfully employed by the same team for the 17th 
consecutive season. There's a correlation here, I think. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rodgers becomes the 11th Angel manager to fail to complete three full 
seasons. The last man to last three was Gene Mauch (1985-87). The only man to 
last more than three was marathon runner Bill Rigney, who somehow weathered 
eight-plus seasons from 1961 to 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Of course, Rigney never worked for Richard Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 -- What were the odds of Jim Riggleman outlasting Rodgers this season? Then 
again, by comparison, that Padre front office is a veritable Rock of Gibraltar. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Now we know what really happened to Bryan Harvey. Harvey to Angels: "My 
arm's fine, I swear, I swear." Angels to Harvey: "We can no longer tolerate 
such brutal honesty. You're outta here." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Maybe Harvey follows Marcel Lachemann back to Anaheim. There has to be a 
player to be named later, right? 
</P>
<P>
 -- There's no crying in baseball. As for lying, well, the Angels prefer to 
call it "job security." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Baseball seemed to survive Michael Jordan's uniform change just fine. As 
opposed to the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 -- As of Sunday morning, Bob Welch was 0-5, Tim Belcher 1-7 and Mike Morgan 
0-5. Maybe Fred Claire had a clue after all. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Still waiting for the Sports Illustrated cover story, "Marge Schott Is 
Embarrassing The Grand Old Game." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Of course, Marge was speaking out of school. What could a nut possibly know 
about fruits? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Evidently, Mitch Williams wasn't the only problem with the Philadelphia 
Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Then again, whoever thought he might be the answer for the Houston Astros 
needs to get outside more often. Even owner Drayton McLane can no longer bear 
to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The class of '84 has aged about as well as Cabbage Patch dolls. Ten years 
ago, the Padres and the Cubs played for the National League pennant; now they 
have the two worst records in the league. Detroit won the World Series in '84; 
now the Tigers are last in the American League East. Kansas City, the fourth 
playoff team that year, just lost three of four to the Angels and has slipped 
below .500 for the season. The correct pronunciation, I believe, is decayed.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Still no sign of Phil Nevin in a major league uniform. Ken Caminiti's 
120-RBI pace probably has something to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It's May 23 and Paul O'Neill is hitting .465. If the ball isn't juiced, 
O'Neill must be playing slo-pitch softball. 
</P>
<P>
 -- O'Neill's batting average is higher than the winning percentages of 10 
major league teams, including the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The American League West is so bad that even ESPN has taken to mocking it 
in magazine promos. Last week, ESPN touted its exciting broadcast lineup 
thusly: "Major League Baseball -- Yes, that includes the American League West." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Of course, under new Angel public relations policy, no one is allowed to 
describe the American League West as "lousy," "a laughing stock," or even "not 
very good." From now on, all Angel employees must refer to the teams composing 
the American League West as "occupationally challenged." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Accepted As Baseball Fact: Managers make all the difference in the world. 
Accepted As Baseball Fact: Tony La Russa is one of the top three managers 
alive. Problem On The Blackboard This Morning: What is Tony La Russa's team 
doing with the second-worst record in baseball? 
</P>
<P>
 -- If the Texas Rangers only had the foresight to re-sign Rafael Palmeiro and 
Julio Franco last winter, they'd be a .500 team today. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Scott Sanderson's 3-0 record with the White Sox has the fans in Comiskey 
dancing in the aisles. Tell them to wait until June. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ken Griffey Jr. is on pace to hit 76 home runs this season, but the ball is 
not juiced. Pass it on. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Joe Carter is on pace to drive in 208 runs this season, but the ball is not 
juiced. Pass it on. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kenny Lofton has already hit six home runs this season, but the ball is not 
juiced. 
</P>
<P>
 -- OK, we had better stop there. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In other news, Scott Erickson pitched a no-hitter for the Minnesota Twins 
this month. Really, that's what it says. Can we get a fact-checker on this? 
</P>
<P>
 -- What's in a name? Just ask the St. Louis Cardinals, who tried replacing Lee 
Smith with Willie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Anthony Young has already won two games this season. That's what happens 
when you rest on your laurels. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Curt Schilling is 0-7 this season. The Phillies ought to trade him for 
Anthony Young. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The best thing about Dodger rookie outfielders Raul Mondesi and Henry 
Rodriguez batting .300 is that Darryl Strawberry continues to bat .000. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only the Houston Astros can redesign their uniforms and make them worse. I 
mean, even the Angels got that one right. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The biggest change in baseball so far this season? All of a sudden, a 4.50 
earned-run average is looking pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ron Gant for commissioner. Got to find him work somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I went to a baseball game the other day and a hockey game broke out.

MAKING IT IN O.C.; GT BICYCLES BEGAN IN GARAGE, TODAY RIDDEN BY TOP RACERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like many of Orange County's high-end bike manufacturers, GT Bicycles started 
out as a garage business. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen years later, "we still like to think of ourselves as a garage 
operation," said Bill Galloway, GT's vice president of operations."The only 
difference is that we're bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 Bigger indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 GT has grown considerably since it was founded by cycling enthusiasts Gary 
Turner and Richard Long. Last November, the privately held company moved its 
administrative offices and distribution staff to a large building in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 GT has expanded in part by acquiring smaller bicycle manufacturers in the 
Orange County area. About 160 of the company's 350 employees work at a 
manufacturing plant in Huntington Beach. The remainder work at the Santa Ana 
building and at a handful of distribution offices scattered around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The company purchases some bike parts -- including wheels -- from third 
parties. But its employees manufacture and assemble the company's tough and 
reliable bike frames at the Huntington Beach plant. 
</P>
<P>
 GT manufactures frames from chrome-alloy, lightweight aluminum and super-tough 
titanium. The company prides itself in the skilled work done by its welders, 
particularly the painstaking task of joining titanium parts. "Even the best 
welders make mistakes, but when you burn titanium, it's several hundred dollars 
of material that's lost," Galloway said. 
</P>
<P>
 GT's bikes are ridden by some of the world's best racers. The company 
regularly sponsors race teams in the United States and Europe.

FIRST PENSION'S STUNNED CLIENTS PLAN NEXT MOVE; INQUIRY: INVESTORS TALKING ON 
PRODIGY AND IN AN O.C. MEETING PLAN SUITS AND WONDER WHY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES 
DID NOT DETECT PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gordon Reiter, Irvin Starr and H. Farrar thought they knew a good investment 
opportunity when they saw one. So, for more than a decade, the three retirees 
gladly trusted their retirement dollars to real estate limited partnerships led 
by First Pension Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiter, a 59-year-old aerospace industry retiree, eventually invested more 
than $200,000 in retirement funds through the "old war horse of a company." 
When Irvine-based First Pension unveiled its newest limited partnership in 
February, Starr, 64, enthusiastically dashed off yet another check. 
</P>
<P>
 So did Farrar, a Ventura County retiree who'd stuck with First Pension largely 
on the strength of a 1991 report from the state Department of Corporations, 
which knew of "no disciplinary records" for the Orange County company, its 
chairman, William E. Cooper, and co-owners Valerie Jensen and Robert Lindley. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was all the more stunning on April 21 when Colorado regulators seized 
Summit Trust Services, a Denver-based First Pension affiliate. On April 22, 
Cooper pushed First Pension into bankruptcy court for protection from 
creditors. On May 13, the FBI and the Securities and Exchange Commission 
alleged that First Pension used a massive pyramid scheme to defraud investors 
out of as much as $124 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrar learned of the bankruptcy filing on the day it happened during a tense 
conversation with a First Pension switchboard operator who told him that the 
company was bankrupt and that the employees had been let go. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that day, as the retiree flew to a business meeting in South America, he 
kept thinking about the numbing conversation. "This is incredible, simply 
incredible," Farrar thought. "I've been . . . involved with them for 12 years 
and all they'll say is, 'We're bankrupt.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Investors are still reeling from the magnitude of the alleged fraud. "I still 
wonder what's really going on," Starr said. "I've still not fully accepted the 
fact that it was an elaborate Ponzi scheme." 
</P>
<P>
 But as the shock wears off, investors are beginning to plot strategies. A 
dozen investors met Thursday in Orange County to consider which attorneys are 
best equipped to handle the inevitable civil lawsuits. Starr, who lives in 
Northern California, is harnessing the Prodigy computer system to communicate 
with other First Pension investors. (To read First Pension messages on Prodigy, 
select the "MONEY TALK" board and "BROKERAGES" topic.) And investors are 
clamoring for answers from state and federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believed the state had done a complete review and found nothing," said 
Farrar, whose August, 1991, letter requested information on various First 
Pension entities as well as Cooper and other company officials. "What more 
could I have done?" Farrar asked. "How could I have matched the muscle or 
knowledge to do what they'd already done?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mark A. O'Connell, an attorney in Newport Beach and a First Pension investor, 
voiced frustration with lax enforcement of the securities industry. "This type 
of crime is running rampant in our society and even after Lincoln Savings, 
Prudential Securities, etc. . . . there seems to be no action taken by our 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal regulators quickly moved to seize First Pension's various businesses. 
On April 13, a federal judge in Los Angeles froze First Pension's assets and 
the bank accounts held by Cooper, Jensen and Lindley. Investors now hope that 
criminal indictments will be returned against the three during upcoming court 
hearings in a Los Angeles federal courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, investors said there were signs that First Pension's unsullied 
record might have had blemishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Manhattan Beach retiree Richard Bradshaw describes himself as someone who does 
his homework before investing. He'd grown comfortable with First Pension over 
the years but "began to get nervous" during a late March meeting when First 
Pension employees couldn't explain a $6,000 discrepancy in his account. "I told 
them you can't stand (an IRS) audit," said Bradshaw, who still did not suspect 
major fraud. "They blamed it all on a computer error and said they'd have it 
fixed." 
</P>
<P>
 But, up until the day before First Pension entered bankruptcy, clerical 
workers continued to mail account statements and brokers kept promoting the 
newest limited partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper did his part to ensure investor calm. In a Feb. 7 letter to account 
holders, he boasted about the company's "excellent track record . . . 
conservative appraisal practices, sound loan underwriting and servicing 
policies." Sticking to those "strict" guidelines, Cooper wrote, allowed First 
Pension to handle 14,500 loans valued at $390 million since 1976 -- and 
generated average investor returns that topped 13%. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as Cooper was composing his "dear shareholder" letter, investigators 
in the SEC's Los Angeles office were revving up their own letter-writing 
campaign as they searched for investors who could support the allegation of 
massive fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Copies of letters provided by investors show that the SEC initially sought 
"voluntary cooperation" from account holders with its investigation into First 
Pension. Investigators then interviewed investors and lower-level First Pension 
employees. But court documents show that Cooper and Jensen refused to answer 
SEC questions and instead exercised their constitutional right to remain 
silent. 
</P>
<P>
 Given subsequent allegations of massive fraud, numerous investors say they are 
angry at themselves for not taking Cooper to task for his frustrating policy of 
refusing to give them copies of trust deeds that were supposedly at the heart 
of the various limited partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrar had planned to confront Cooper's penchant for privacy during a 10:30 
a.m. meeting May 12 at First Pension's Irvine headquarters. But the meeting was 
effectively canceled by the April 22 Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors who managed to meet with Cooper generally came away empty-handed. 
Investor Donna Bedale, in papers filed in District Court in Los Angeles, told 
investigators that Cooper "had a policy not to divulge that information to 
investors because one investor (previously) had confronted a homeowner." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always been nervous about that one thing," Bradshaw said. "He'd never 
actually shown us the mortgages. As we pressed him for information (about trust 
deeds), he'd always make excuses."

U.S. STUDY BACKS ALLOWING EXPORT OF ALASKAN OIL; ENERGY: THE REPORT PREDICTS 
THAT LIFTING THE '70S-ERA BAN WOULD CREATE JOBS AND BOOST FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 
REVENUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's hard-pressed independent oil producers will get good news this 
morning as the Clinton Administration releases details of an unpublished but 
long-awaited study of lifting the current ban on Alaskan crude oil exports. 
</P>
<P>
 The Energy Department cost-benefits study predicts that ending the ban would 
create as many as 7,000 jobs in the California and Alaska oil industries. It 
also estimates a boost to the federal treasury -- mostly from higher oil-tax 
revenues -- of as much as $284 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The independents, along with British Petroleum Co., have long lobbied to end 
the ban they say forces oil that would otherwise be sold in Asia into the 
glutted California market, depressing regional crude prices. The independents 
argue that the ban has cost the state 32,000 oil industry jobs since 1985 as it 
has stifled investment and production in California's vast oil fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition has come chiefly from U.S. maritime unions and shippers, who have 
been guaranteed the tanker jobs by a federal law controlling marine traffic 
between U.S. ports. That federal law does not apply to exports. 
</P>
<P>
 Now such opposition has apparently ended in a still-unannounced agreement 
between BP -- the big Alaska producer hoping to enter the Asian market -- and 
the maritime interests. Though oil company executives have declined to confirm 
the details, BP apparently will agree to use U.S. crews and ships in any tanker 
traffic from Alaska to Japan, the expected destination for much of the surplus 
Alaskan crude. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand that the unionized shippers and the oil and gas companies and 
their unions have been coming up with a win-win solution," William White, 
assistant energy secretary, confirmed to The Times "And we are encountering 
many people in Congress and union leaders who have historically opposed the 
export of Alaskan North Slope oil, who have this past week come to us and said 
that they have reversed their position." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Clinton Administration has yet to take a formal position on the 
ban, several high Administration officials have said that the ban should be 
overturned if the Energy Department study finds such a move to be 
cost-effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the study makes no specific recommendation on the ban, White said, 
highlights of the study show significant economic benefits to the West Coast 
oil industry: 
</P>
<P>
 * If world oil prices remain low, the study estimates a net job gain in the 
California and Alaska oil industry of 6,500 in 1994 and 1995, dropping to 6,000 
jobs total during the period 1996 to 2000. If world oil prices rise, the early 
job increase would be less -- 4,800 in 1994-1995 -- but gains would be greater 
later on: up to 7,000 jobs from 1996 through 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Those numbers would be even higher if the apparent pact with the maritime 
industry is formalized, since the study estimates that lifting the ban could 
otherwise jeopardize 230 to 494 U.S. shipping jobs in 1994 and 1995, using 
figures from the U.S. Department of Transportation's maritime administration. 
</P>
<P>
 * California crude oil price hikes from ending the ban would increase federal 
revenues by $20 million to $25 million annually at the Elk Hills Naval 
Petroleum Reserve, near Bakersfield, currently the nation's seventh-largest 
producing field. Adding increased federal tax revenue from the expected higher 
sales of other oil producers would bring the annual federal benefit to $284 
million from $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Higher crude prices would give producers incentives to make new investments 
in existing fields, lessening "pressures for new production in frontier and 
wilderness areas," White said. These investments are particularly important for 
the North Slope, where production has been declining in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 * No "significant" impact on consumer gasoline prices at the pump would be 
expected, according to White. Independent producers will agree, saying that 
retail gasoline prices are tied to world, not regional, crude prices. However, 
some retail analysts have predicted price hikes in California of up to 6 cents 
a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some West Coast refiners, which the study found to have higher profit 
margins than the rest of the industry, could be hurt by a rise in their crude 
oil feedstock prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantic Richfield Co. and Exxon Corp., two other big Alaska crude producers, 
consume virtually all their production in their own refineries and distribution 
networks and would not be significantly affected by a lifting of the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The ban dates from the oil crises of the 1970s, when Congress was considering 
legislation to enable construction of the Trans-Alaskan pipeline to bring crude 
oil from Alaska's remote North Slope south across the state to the year-round 
port of Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when angry Americans were waiting in gas lines, the ban was included 
to assure U.S. control of the domestic crude as well as jobs for the U.S. 
maritime fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world has changed," White said. For one thing, he noted, when the ban was 
passed no strategic reserves existed -- such as the 600 million barrels now 
stockpiled at Elk Hills -- beyond what is produced for sale, to protect the 
nation against foreign oil boycotts and other crises. 
</P>
<P>
 Most observers expect only 150,000 barrels a day to be diverted from the 
Alaskan production to Asian markets, White added. U.S. consumption is about 16 
million barrels daily, with 7 million barrels of that from foreign producers. 
</P>
<P>
 White expects to detail findings from the report in Monterey, Calif., today at 
the annual meeting of the California Independent Petroleum Assn., which has 
lobbied forcefully to end the ban.

 It's not unusual for unusual topics to come up at annual meetings, but Time 
Warner Chief Executive Gerald M. Levin got his share last week at the company's 
annual meeting on a sound stage at the Warner Bros. studio in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the highlights from the question-and-answer session between shareholders 
and Levin: 
</P>
<P>
 * One shareholder asked Levin if he could get a tour of the Warner Bros. lot. 
</P>
<P>
 * One complained that movie trailers shown to stockholders during one part of 
the meeting were too loud. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another shareholder suggested that Warner Bros. make a movie that would 
"make everyone laugh." Photo Finished 
</P>
<P>
 It's what one might expect in a town known for visual effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, 20th Century Fox ran a two-page picture in Hollywood's trade 
publications showing dozens of studio employees from top executives on down 
lined up choir-style in a big group picture. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose: to thank everyone who had something to do with Fox's huge hit 
film "Mrs. Doubtfire," among them star Robin Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out four of the people in the picture -- including such heavyweights as 
Fox owner Rupert Murdoch and President Bill Mechanic -- weren't actually there 
when the shot was taken, so their pictures were inserted into the photo. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Fox shot all of the executives outside by a "Mrs. Doubtfire" 
billboard, but the lighting turned out to be bad. So another picture, minus the 
four, was taken on a sound stage and made to look as if it had been taken in 
front of the billboard with the four missing persons in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Jaffe, Fox's president of domestic marketing, said it was important to 
the studio that everyone involved in the film's success be shown in the photo. 
List Them in the Credits 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles has had a "pawnshop to the stars," "car stereo shop to the stars" 
and even a "coroner to the stars." 
</P>
<P>
 Now attorneys at the Century City law firm of Levene & Eisenberg appear to be 
vying for the title of "bankruptcy lawyers to the stars." 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing last week that actress Lynn Redgrave was filing for protection 
from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, lawyer David Neale 
noted that his firm also recently represented actresses Zsa Zsa Gabor and Kim 
Basinger in their respective bankruptcy proceedings. He Needs His Own Advice 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, James R. Wyatt was touting in an infomercial his book called 
"101 Ways to Get Cash From the Government." Now it appears that the Rocklin, 
Calif.-based Wyatt is the one who could use the cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyatt claimed in his book that people who read it could get an average of 
$87,500 in loans and government grants. Wyatt has since settled Federal Trade 
Commission charges that he made phony claims about grants and loans that are 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Wyatt, the FTC said, his Wyatt Marketing Corp. is in Chapter 7 
bankruptcy proceedings.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: PASADENA FUND WAITS FOR TURN IN GROWTH STOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If managing money is coping with a series of feasts and famines, Roger 
Engemann may be one of the hungriest people in the business today. 
</P>
<P>
 His Pasadena-based investment firm, Roger Engemann & Associates, has long been 
the most vocal cheerleader for America's big-name consumer growth stocks -- 
issues such as Coca-Cola, Walt Disney, Wal-Mart and Philip Morris. 
</P>
<P>
 From the mid-'80s until 1992, Engemann practically minted money by owning 
those stocks, as they rocketed in value. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the past 2 1/2 years, the brand-name consumer companies have been Wall 
Street's biggest dogs. And because he has been unwilling to abandon those 
stocks, Engemann has suffered more than perhaps any other major money manager. 
</P>
<P>
 His flagship Pasadena Growth mutual fund is in its third consecutive year of 
sharply underperforming the average stock fund. In 1993, when the average stock 
fund rose 12.5%, Pasadena Growth dropped 5.9%. So far this year, Engemann's 
fund is off 5.3%, versus a 3.1% loss for the average fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, Engemann's losses have been magnified by what he admits have been some 
particularly onerous blunders. He owned medical device firm U.S. Surgical, for 
example, which became "the worst stock in our 25-year history," he says. The 
stock has crashed from nearly $80 last year to $17 now. 
</P>
<P>
 Engemann may also have been a victim of his own hype. He aggressively touted 
the consumer stocks in 1992, even as some Wall Street pros warned that the 
shares were overvalued and that many of the companies were losing pricing power 
in the weak economy. 
</P>
<P>
 As Merrill Lynch and other major brokers plowed $2.5 billion worth of new 
clients' cash into Engemann's funds during 1992, he was forced to buy the 
consumer stocks at what turned out to be peak prices for many of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after two years of losses, Engemann faces the downside of rapid success: 
an equally rapid fall from grace. His firm's assets, which leaped from $1.3 
billion in 1991 to $5 billion a year ago, have tumbled to $4 billion now as 
disgruntled investors have pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the 53-year-old Engemann remains unapologetically bullish on the consumer 
products giants he owns. In fact, he is telling clients that if they stick with 
him, their gains could be as large as 70% over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Engemann brought that message to the Anaheim Hilton on Friday and Saturday, 
where he held his annual client conference. For years, the show was a happy 
affair that gave Engemann's mostly retiree clients a chance to thank him for 
the money he'd made for them. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, not surprisingly, Engemann spent most of his time on the defensive, 
explaining what has gone wrong and when he expected to begin making money 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Hollywood to a relatively poor family, Engemann earned his college 
degrees in economics and worked as a stock analyst in the 1960s, before 
launching his own investment firm in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually from the start, his philosophy has been disarmingly simple: Buy 
shares of the biggest, most successful consumer-oriented growth companies, and 
hold them. Avoid industrial firms, bonds, most smaller stocks and other less 
predictable investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past 20 years, Engemann's strategy has worked exceedingly well, as 
brand-name firms such as Coca-Cola, Pfizer and Colgate-Palmolive have 
mushroomed in size with the aging of free-spending baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after his dismal performance of the last few years, $100,000 invested 
with Engemann in 1978 would be worth $1.4 million today -- about $500,000 more 
than if you had invested in the Standard & Poor's 500 blue-chip stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Engemann admitted to his clients at the Anaheim show that he has never 
endured as long a period of lousy performance as the past 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Engemann blames his troubles on the convergence of three factors. First, Wall 
Street has been chasing cyclical stocks such as car and machinery makers in 
anticipation of a growing economy -- which is finally here. So the 
steady-growth consumer stocks have taken a back seat to the cyclical issues, 
and for longer than Engemann believed was possible.  
</P>
<P>
 Second, fear of rising competition -- and thus slower earnings growth -- has 
clipped drug, food, tobacco and retail stocks. Some of those fears have been 
rational. Drug firms' earnings have indeed been slammed by the advent of health 
care reform. Tobacco firms' pricing woes are well known. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Engemann argues that earnings concerns have been exaggerated for most 
of his stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, Engemann concedes that he stuck with some companies whose problems were 
deeper than he understood. U.S. Surgical, which lost a major patent suit, was 
Engemann's biggest loser, but he admits that Tampax maker Tambrands and waste 
management firm WMX Technologies also turned out to be mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 So why does Engemann believe the worst is over for his stocks? For one thing, 
he sees investors' long love affair with cyclical stocks waning, now that Wall 
Street has bid up the stocks' prices to reflect much or all of their expected 
earnings rebound in the near term. The recent slide in auto stocks may 
foreshadow the end of the cyclicals' winning streak, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, Engemann says, is that many of his consumer-growth stocks have 
become cheap by historical standards, as their earnings have continued to rise 
over the past two years while the stocks have been flat or fallen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stocks of America's best companies are being avoided," Engemann told his 
clients. "But this situation won't last." 
</P>
<P>
 Coca-Cola shares, for example, have been stuck around $40 since 1991. Yet 
Coke's earnings grew 17% in both 1992 and 1993, Engemann notes.  
</P>
<P>
 Engemann says the average stock in his portfolios now is priced at 16 times 
estimated 1994 earnings per share. If the companies' collective annual earnings 
growth is 15% over the next two years, Engemann says, then the stocks' prices 
must rise 30% over that period just to keep their price-to-earnings ratio (or 
P-E) at 16. 
</P>
<P>
 And if Wall Street again becomes willing to pay a premium for classic growth 
stocks, Engemann says, the gain in his stocks should be much larger. If the 
average P-E of his stocks rises to 20 in two years, he says, his portfolio 
would rocket 70% from current levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, those calculations are based on many assumptions, not the least of 
which are that interest rates and inflation remain low. Any rise in rates or 
inflation would assuredly depress stock P-Es, even for the best growth stocks, 
Engemann concedes. 
</P>
<P>
 But his central message to clients is that the market is forever going through 
cycles, and that his stocks have done their time, and then some. "I firmly 
believe you will get paid for waiting," Engemann says. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, most of his clients are giving him the benefit of the doubt. Jack 
Cave, a Coronado retiree at the Anaheim conference, said Engemann has produced 
terrific returns for him since 1974. Cave credits Engemann's willingness to 
stick with his plan. "He believes in hanging in there," Cave said. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Betty, also is a big Engemann fan, despite the losses of recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll go down, but it'll come back," she said -- holding up crossed fingers 
and grinning. A Tough Two Years 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the classic growth stocks owned by money manager Roger 
Engemann, how the stocks have fared versus their peak prices of 1992-93, and 
the stocks' price-to-earnings ratios today based on estimated 1994 earnings per 
share. 05,22,12,09,08,14 '92-'93 Fri. Pct. P-E on Stock peak price close change

</P>
<P>
 Roger Engemann's Pasadena Growth stock fund, which invests almost exclusively 
in big-name consumer growth stocks, had a spectacular run between 1988 and 
1991. But many of Engemann's favorite stocks have fallen out of favor sinc 
then, causing the fund to badly lag the market.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE; WITH ATTENDANCE DOWN, KNOTT'S BERRY FARM HOPES 
THAT ITS NEWEST ATTRACTION WILL GET IT; OUT OF A JAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Half a century ago, the Knott family stapled brief messages to menus in the 
Chicken Dinner Restaurant in Buena Park. "Patrons please note," they read. 
"Rumors we have sold out are being persistently circulated. We have NOT, nor is 
the place for sale." 
</P>
<P>
 The same kind of rumors, coupled with quick denials, still surface 
periodically. But where the talk once flourished during the runaway success of 
what is now Knott's Berry Farm, the recent whispers come after three years of 
weak attendance at an amusement park that has been a regional landmark for 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 As Knott's enters its 54th summer season, it is struggling to compete as the 
only family-run theme park in Southern California. It is surrounded by four 
larger -- and better-funded -- parks owned by entertainment or consumer 
products conglomerates. 
</P>
<P>
 The corporate-owned attractions, including nearby Disneyland, spend tens of 
millions of dollars each year on new rides and advertising campaigns. By 
contrast, Knott's recent new attractions have been relatively meager, and it 
has thinned its executive ranks and put off a planned worldwide expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping for a comeback, Knott's is set to unveil a special-effects show called 
Mystery Lodge on Saturday. It is the park's most ambitious undertaking since 
the recession hit California in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 Knott's hopes to regain ground in the theme park wars by outsmarting -- not 
outspending -- its rivals, park officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We find ourselves in a business that is incredibly dominated by media and 
communications giants," said Darrel Anderson, one of the grandsons of founders 
Walter and Cordelia Knott and a former board chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It leaves us as one of the last independent amusement parks in a major market 
-- and probably at a competitive disadvantage," he said. "But we have carved 
out a niche (for) family, wholesome entertainment that is still in demand." 
</P>
<P>
 Mystery Lodge is the kind of attraction Knott's executives hope will lure 
their most important target audience: young parents and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the barn-size, wood-covered building bedecked with totem poles, guests 
will watch an actor portraying a mystical Canadian Native, who spins stories as 
images waft from the smoke of an ersatz campfire and fly around the room. 
</P>
<P>
 A storytelling attraction is hardly conventional in an industry dominated by 
white-knuckle roller coasters and gut-wrenching simulator rides. But that's 
fine by Knott's President Terry E. Van Gorder, who said he wants something that 
further sets the park apart from its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a celebration of the human spirit, of the magic and mystery of life," 
said Van Gorder, who became enthralled when he saw a forerunner of the Mystery 
Lodge attraction at the Expo '86 world's fair in Vancouver, British Columbia. 
"It dwells on the family, the need for bonding of one generation to the next." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being different, Mystery Lodge is significantly less expensive than 
most theme park attractions. It cost $10 million, compared to the estimated $60 
million that Universal Studios spent last year on its "Back to the Future" 
simulation ride, and a similar amount Disneyland is said to be spending to 
create an "Indiana Jones Adventure" ride opening next year. 
</P>
<P>
 While Mystery Lodge may be a relative bargain, it is a strategic risk. No one 
knows whether children will bug their parents to take them to hear a 
storyteller. Mystery Lodge will add another Native American-themed attraction 
to the park; the Indian Trails crafts village of two summers ago spurred little 
additional attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Knott's can ill afford many duds. The recession has been so hard on the park 
that Van Gorder refers to it as "the depression." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with its regional competitors, Knott's has fallen in popularity among 
the nation's other theme parks. It ranked ninth last year, with 3.7 million 
people attending, down from fifth in 1991, according to an annual listing by 
Amusement Business in Nashville, Tenn. Last year, Knott's placed behind 
Universal Studios-Hollywood and Sea World in San Diego, but ahead of Six Flags 
Magic Mountain in Valencia. And, as usual, all trailed Disneyland, which was 
second in the nation last year with 11.4 million visitors, just behind Walt 
Disney World in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is harder for them each year," Dennis Speigel, a theme park consultant in 
Cincinnati, said of Knott's. "The bigger companies can market smarter. They can 
buy advertising cheaper. And out there in California, advertising has to be 
your biggest cost outside of labor." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the other Southern California theme parks, Knott's generally sets its 
admission prices several dollars below those at Disneyland. Its current price 
is $26.95 for adults and $15.95 for children ages 3 to 11, but it often has 
widely available discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 While there has been talk of a sale to Walt Disney Co., Marriott Corp. or 
Paramount Communications Inc., the family will hear none of it. "That will 
never happen," said Virginia Knott Bender, a daughter of the founders. 
</P>
<P>
 Knott's has managed to stay profitable because, in keeping with the frugal 
ways of its original owners, it is virtually debt-free. The entire operation, 
which generates about $200 million in total annual sales, has also been helped 
by steady growth in its packaged-foods division and products such as premium 
ice creams and artificially sweetened boysenberry preserves. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the theme park is the core business, and it sets the pace of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had earthquakes, floods, a poor economy, companies moving out of the 
state, riots, murders -- so many things," said Bender, 81, who still works at 
her gift shop at the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the number of visitors has been dropping steadily, Van Gorder said, he 
has been holding off from launching major new projects or replacing outdated 
rides. Now, however, the family is going ahead with a five-year plan that will 
add, among other things, a third roller coaster. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is still plenty on which to build. Knott's is one of the region's 
most beautifully landscaped parks, with some of the trees that were planted by 
founder Walter Knott still there. 
</P>
<P>
 It has the best food of any park in the nation, according to one poll. And, 
perhaps most important, it has a certain earnestness, a lack of pretension, 
that sets it apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Knott's has also adopted innovative marketing methods to attract crowds to the 
150-acre park. A monthlong Halloween Haunt, in which workers dress up as ghouls 
and the rides are re-themed to be scary, sells out every year. Knott's is also 
a leader in marketing to ethnic groups -- from a gospel choir day to Fiesta 
Filipino.

U.S. IN LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO THWART SUIT BY HUGHES; AEROSPACE: THE PENTAGON 
ALLEGEDLY STOLE SATELLITE TECHNOLOGY. A JUDGMENT UP TO $1.2 BILLION IS EXPECTED 
IN 23-YEAR-OLD CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Staring at a likely $1-billion judgment, the federal government is making an 
11th-hour effort to undermine a patent infringement case brought by Hughes 
Aircraft 23 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A final ruling on the amount owed to Hughes by the government is expected to 
be handed down by the end of May by U.S. Court of Claims Judge James T. Turner, 
who presided over a one-year trial in 1988 and has been methodically 
considering a final ruling for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys close to the case and outside experts predict that Turner's ruling 
is likely to fall in a range of $800 million to $1.2 billion, making it the 
largest patent judgment in history against the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now in the face of the verdict, lawyers from the Justice Department are 
searching for a magic bullet that would deflate the Hughes case, which alleges 
the Pentagon stole the technology that enabled the communications satellite 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department attorneys are seeking any information or theories from 
outsiders or experts that might blow a hole in Hughes' case, according to 
several defense-industry and patent attorneys across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are having apoplexy because they are afraid Congress is going to kill 
them," said Herbert Fenster, a leading defense-industry lawyer. "They are 
trying to find some technical way to kill the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Justice attorneys declined to be interviewed, but in response to a question 
about the efforts, department spokesman John Russell acknowledged: "We are 
always looking for evidence for bolstering our arguments." 
</P>
<P>
 The last-ditch effort has amazed Hughes attorneys. "They have dredged up 
everything over the years," said Sheldon Karon, a Chicago attorney who 
represents the company. "Some of it has been in the class of Elvis sightings. I 
can't imagine what they would find at this stage." 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes asserted in the case that the Pentagon infringed on an invention by 
Donald Williams, a brilliant young engineer at Hughes who in the early 1960s 
developed a simple lightweight device for controlling a communications 
satellite in orbit. With Williams' concept, a spinning satellite can be 
controlled in every axis with just a single rocket thruster. 
</P>
<P>
 The Claims Court has already ruled that Hughes' patent was valid and that the 
government indeed infringed upon it. The last step is the monetary ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 The award will depend on two parts, the royalty rate on the value of the 
satellites and the interest rate to compensate Hughes for the long delays in 
getting its money. Hughes is seeking a 15% royalty rate, while the Justice 
Department has argued for 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Justice Department has also suggested that the interest accruing on 
those royalties should be based on short-term Treasury Department bills, while 
Hughes has argued that its annual return on equity would represent how it could 
have invested the royalties. 
</P>
<P>
 The judgment could be as little as $84 million if Turner fully accepts the 
Justice Department's formula, according to Victor Savikas, a Hughes attorney in 
Los Angeles. But Savikas added that the Los Angeles-based defense contractor 
could realize a mind-boggling $6 billion under the company's preferred formula. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, who is widely praised for his careful rulings, is likely to throw out 
both positions, striving for a conservative decision that will withstand likely 
appeals. Experts say the most probable outcome is a 5% to 8% royalty rate and 
interest based on the same rate that the IRS uses to compensate taxpayers on 
old refunds. On that basis, the verdict would fall into a range of $800 million 
to $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes attorneys say they give Justice Department lawyers credit for stalling 
the patent award for so many years. "The government hasn't paid a dime," Karon 
said. "They have done a good job of staving off judgment day. John Gacy went 14 
years before he took his final walk. This is even longer."

TIME TICKS AWAY FOR REPAIR OF QUAKE-HIT OFFICES; REAL ESTATE: OWNERS WORK 
AGAINST THE CLOCK TO FIX BUILDINGS BEFORE TENANTS CAN EXERCISE ESCAPE CLAUSES 
IN LEASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As owners of about two dozen large, quake-damaged office buildings in the San 
Fernando Valley struggle to make repairs and reopen, many of them are racing 
against a deadline: July 17. 
</P>
<P>
 More than just the six-month anniversary of the Northridge earthquake, it 
marks the day when many tenants of these buildings can exercise an escape 
clause and walk away from their five- and 10-year leases. In some contracts, 
landlords have even less than six months to fix their properties before tenants 
can break rental agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 Some owners are unlikely to meet their deadlines because of delays in securing 
Small Business Administration loans, insurance payments, construction permits 
and contractors. But not all displaced tenants are sympathetic. Complaining 
about working out of boxes in their homes or tight temporary offices, some 
tenants say they won't wait more than they're required to before moving 
permanently elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a waiting game to see which (building) owner comes back and when," said 
Cathy Scullin, a broker at Zugsmith-Thind, a commercial real estate firm in 
Encino. And if they do, she asked, "do they come back intact, or crippled 
because they lost their tenants?" 
</P>
<P>
 Neal Tenen is one of seven lawyers who shared offices at the Sherman Oaks 
Atrium at Magnolia and Sepulveda boulevards, before the earthquake forced them 
to scatter and set up makeshift offices, mostly in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenen says he has been a tenant at the Atrium for seven years. "It's a 
super-nice building," he said of the four-story structure with hundreds of 
windows, many of which were shattered by the quake, and an atrium that is now 
obstructed by construction scaffolds. But if the 96,000-square-foot building 
isn't repaired by mid-July, as required under his lease, Tenen says he may not 
come back. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Department of Building and Safety estimated the Atrium's structural 
damage at $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenen and other lawyers are talking about buying a small office building of 
their own. "It's going to be a close call" whether the owner meets the 
deadline, he said. "There could be a mad rush to finish." 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of Sherman Oaks Atrium, Advent Realty Limited Partnership, declined 
to comment. But the Atrium's leasing agent, John Sabourin of Beitler Commercial 
Realty Services, says the owner had earthquake insurance. Sabourin says the 
building was 80% occupied before the quake and will reopen in mid-June, meaning 
tenants will have to return under their leases or face a possible lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the 6.8-magnitude quake, tenants gave little thought to the fine print 
in leases called the "damage and destruction" clause. But the clause typically 
gives landlords three to six months to restore their properties after a 
disaster, said Bill Inglis, a broker with CB Commercial Real Estate Group in 
Sherman Oaks. Attorneys say tenants signing new leases now want shorter time 
limits for landlords to make repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners are keenly aware of these deadlines, but their efforts to beat 
them are running up against delays caused by heavy demand for construction work 
and governmental services. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Berman is waiting for an SBA loan to rebuild the Scotty Building on 
Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks. The Scotty Building is actually two 
structures that are connected, totaling 74,000 square feet. But one of them, a 
two-story structure, burned in a fire caused by the Northridge quake; the other 
five-story building reopened a month ago after smoke damage had been cleaned 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman says his insurance policy covered the $3-million damage, and his plans 
are to build a new two-story structure. But he says that building won't be 
finished for another year. Still, Berman says he isn't worried about reopening 
without tenants because he expects plenty of tenants dislocated from the quake 
to be in need of good office space; plus, he claims many of his tenants will 
return, even after a yearlong wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Brokers agree that office space in the Valley is tightening: the office 
vacancy rate dropped to under 10% in the first quarter, from nearly 14% in the 
previous quarter. One big reason: 25 major office buildings in the Valley were 
severely damaged by the quake, according to a survey by the real estate firm 
Zugsmith-Thind. The survey didn't count office buildings smaller than 20,000 
square feet, or headquarter buildings such as the Hamburger Hamlet building in 
Sherman Oaks -- part of which was ripped apart by the quake and remains empty. 
The survey also didn't include the scores of retail shops that were ravaged by 
the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 One high-rise that beat the six-month deadline was the Tower, a 13-story 
building in Sherman Oaks on Ventura Boulevard. But it took more than $1 million 
of insurance money and a construction crew of 200 who worked round-the-clock to 
get the building reopened in late March. 
</P>
<P>
 The 160,500-square-foot Tower is one of seven office buildings in the Valley 
owned by pension funds that are managed by TCW Realty Advisors in Los Angeles. 
On Jan. 17, the Tower was trashed: Water pipes burst, doors jammed, partitions 
collapsed and many deep cracks ran along the building's shear walls like lines 
on the palm of a hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Leuty, who manages the Tower for TCW, said it cost several million 
dollars to complete the repairs. TCW manages dozens of buildings nationwide, 
and that gave it an edge in hustling up contractors, Leuty said. Seismic 
engineers were at the Tower a few hours after the quake, and TCW had quick 
access to specialists who apply epoxy, a strong adhesive used to fill cracks in 
concrete walls, which has been in heavy demand lately. 
</P>
<P>
 Leuty said the Tower had to hurry because offices were leased at $1.75 to 
$1.90 per square foot, so the building was losing about $275,000 a month in 
rent. The Tower was 95% occupied before the quake, but it isn't clear how many 
tenants will return. Leuty said tenants are coming back slowly, but some 
businesses that were struggling before the quake will probably never return. "I 
don't think we really know for sure," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tower tenants like Beitler, which had squeezed workers in cramped offices in 
Encino for two months, say they are glad to be back at the Tower. So are nearby 
retailers, who have lost customers who worked in the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very, very hurt," said Pam Chinvaraj, a longtime waitress at the Aajak 
Thai restaurant, a few steps from the Tower, which counted on workers at the 
building for much of its lunch business. "We're really happy they're coming 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 But many businesses who were tenants of quake-damaged buildings remain in 
limbo. "We're still working out of boxes," lamented Irv Kornblum, whose 
accounting firm has moved twice since the AIC Plaza in Sherman Oaks was hit by 
the quake. "We lost two weeks time just unloading and loading boxes," he said. 
"And this during the busy tax-preparing season." Kornblum says his firm has 2 
1/2 years left on a five-year lease at the AIC Plaza, and one month left on a 
three-month lease for his current office in North Hollywood. "I'm not really 
sure where we'll end up," he said, adding with a tinge of resentment that the 
six-month clause in his lease is a "stingy point" and too long. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Parker, whose American Insurance Consultants Inc. owns the AIC Plaza, says 
his 80,000-square-foot building will be ready by June 1. Parker said he has no 
debt on the building, but he would not say how much damage his building 
sustained or whether he had earthquake insurance. City Building and Safety 
Department officials put the repair estimate at about $1 million. "Everybody 
will be coming back," Parker said, adding that it was costing him a "small 
fortune" to make repairs.

 Edison, PG&E to Test Japanese Electric Cars: In the first road tests by U.S. 
utilities of Japanese-designed electric vehicles, Southern California Edison 
Co. and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. have confirmed that they will test a small 
number of Honda Civics converted to run on electricity.Edison will get two 
Honda vehicles. The Japanese auto makers' progress toward meeting the 1998 
mandate for introducing zero-emission vehicles -- almost certainly electric 
cars -- into California showrooms has largely remained secretive, although they 
joined Detroit auto makers in opposing the mandate. Honda, Mazda, Nissan and 
Toyota must join General Motors, Ford and Chrysler in meeting the deadline.

FEDERATED MAY SWEETEN MACY BID 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federated Department Stores Inc., stepping up its pursuit of R.H. Macy & Co., 
said Sunday that it may sweeten its bid to get the retailer out of Bankruptcy 
Court and is continuing to meet with creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 Federated said it believes its $3.83-billion proposal "and the possible 
enhancements discussed with creditors last week provide more value to all 
creditor constituents than does Macy's stand-alone proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 Federated's statement was the company's first public reaction to a decision 
Friday by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland directing Macy alone to file 
a reorganization plan with the court as soon as possible. Lifland's order 
affirmed Macy's exclusive right under law to file a plan by Aug. 1, and put the 
presentation of Federated's plan on hold at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 The request capped a week in which Federated and Macy tried to rally support 
for their rival proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Sanger, a Federated spokeswoman, wouldn't elaborate Sunday on what the 
enhancements might be. She said the Cincinnati-based retailer has had "numerous 
conversations in the past week" with Macy's secured creditors. "It is our 
understanding that we have made considerable progress with that group," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomberg Business News, citing unnamed sources close to the negotiations, 
reported that Federated increased its offer to secured creditors, winning their 
support. Representatives of the secured creditors could not be reached for 
comment. Lifland and court-appointed mediator Cyrus Vance emphasized throughout 
the process that they sought a plan that all creditors could support, but 
Sanger said there was no consensus.

UNITED, UNIONS AGREE ON REVISED BUYOUT PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 United Airlines and two of its unions announced an agreement Sunday to revise 
a buyout accord under which the airline's employees will become majority owners 
of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, members of the Air Line Pilots Assn., the International 
Assn. of Machinists and salaried and management employee groups get a new 
formula for ensuring the longer-term value of their more than $4.5 billion in 
wages, benefits and work-rule concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Shareholders will be guaranteed a certain amount for their stock through an 
underwriting financed by UAL Corp., the holding company for the airline. 
</P>
<P>
 Adjustments related to UAL's employee stock ownership plan will also be made. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal was designed to smooth over discontent that emerged when the price of 
the company's stock plummeted in recent weeks amid turmoil in the stock and 
bond markets. The stock, which hit a 52-week low of $117.75 a share on May 16, 
closed Friday at $119.375. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, which must be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, is 
expected to be presented to shareholders for a vote next month. 
</P>
<P>
 After the deal is approved and all existing shares of UAL are tendered, a new 
stock will be created. Under the plan reached Sunday, unions will get a 55% 
share in the company instead of a 53% share in the original proposal. The 
unions will be able to increase the stake up to 63% if the "new" UAL stock 
reaches $74.55 within a year instead of $89.22 under the original proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "These changes work for our shareholders and will help ensure that United 
becomes competitive in the aviation marketplace," said Steven Wolf, United's 
chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement was reached during a two-day meeting this weekend between pilots 
and United executives in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are enthusiastic and eager to proceed with closing the transaction 
promptly," said Capt. Roger Hall, head of United's airline pilots group. 
</P>
<P>
 The last-minute maneuvering is the latest twist in a deal that is expected to 
make United the nation's largest employee-owned company and the first of its 
size to take that step while in relatively healthy financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
 United's drive toward employee ownership was slowed when its stock dropped 
below a level at which unions, by some interpretations, had the option of 
walking away from the deal. The declining stock price gave new ammunition to 
dissidents within the pilots union who had fought the deal from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilots union leadership went back to the company a week ago seeking an 
adjustment in some financial conditions to insure the employee stake. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, meanwhile, was concerned about the erosion in the return for 
shareholders under the original agreement, which had called for shareholders to 
receive a mix of cash, debt and preferred stock totaling $88 a share. With the 
decline in the bond market, that $88 had been eroded. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, the buyout calls for the pilots and machinists unions to trade $4.9 
billion in wage and work-rule concessions for majority ownership of UAL. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Sunday's announcement, the deal had seemed uncertain.

 ICI Wants Standardized Classifications: The mutual fund industry should 
standardize how it classifies "load" funds so shareholders won't be as confused 
about sales charges, the industry's trade group said.The Investment Company 
Institute proposed classifying as Class A shares those mutual funds sold 
through brokers and financial planners that charge a commission when the fund 
is first purchased. These are known as "front-end load" funds. The institute 
wants funds where the commission charged by brokers is spread over a few years 
to be classified as Class B shares. Load funds where the commission is paid to 
brokers in two parts should be known as Class C shares, the institute said.

 No Sale of Philippine Airlines: Lucio Tan, majority owner of a consortium that

the Philippines' flag carrier.He has also asked employees for "sacrifices" to 
help save the carrier. The beer and tobacco magnate was earlier reported to be 
selling his 50.1% stake in PR Holdings, the consortium that bid $388.9 million 
to win 67% of the airline when it was privatized in 1992. The airline is beset 
by rising personnel and maintenance costs while it faces heightened competition 
on domestic routes.

 GNP Up 5.46% in First Quarter: The increase in the gross national product was 
0.44% less than predicted three months ago, the Cabinet said.The Directorate 
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics said the economy grew at a 
slower-than-expected rate due to a decline in the country's trade surplus. The 
directorate cut its forecast for economic growth for the second quarter by 
0.29% to 5.71% and lowered its prediction of GNP growth for all of 1994 by 
0.26% to 5.94%. Taiwan's GNP grew by 5.78% in 1993.

U.S., JAPAN PLAN TO SWAP 'DUAL-USE' TECHNOLOGIES; TRADE: AMERICAN MILITARY 
KNOWLEDGE WILL BE EXCHANGED FOR CIVILIAN TECHNOLOGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a new U.S.-Japan cooperative effort, American military technology with 
potential commercial uses will be offered to Japanese firms in exchange for 
"dual-use" civilian technology applicable to weapons systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S.-initiated "Technology for Technology" program, aimed at creating more 
advanced weapons at lower cost, has drawn interest from some of the Japanese 
corporations whose technology is sought by the Pentagon. But these firms 
generally remain unclear about prospects for profitable deals and wary of a 
possible backlash from the Japanese public, which still has a post-World War II 
aversion to military-related activities. 
</P>
<P>
 In previous U.S.-Japan programs to share defense technology, nearly all the 
flow has been from the United States to Japan. Japanese law bans arms exports 
and allows export of military technology only to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The new program, quietly agreed on by the two governments last month, aims at 
creating a more balanced two-way technology flow by expanding cooperation into 
Japan's commercial sector. It also seeks to enhance the ability of U.S. defense 
manufacturers to keep up with fast-moving technical developments in commercial 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Defense Department is especially interested in gaining access to 
cutting-edge Japanese technology in the fields of composite materials for 
aircraft, ceramics for use in engines, and electronics such as flat-panel 
displays. 
</P>
<P>
 It could prove difficult to find ways to offer Japanese firms enough 
technology to win their cooperation without drawing criticism in the United 
States over sharing taxpayer-funded research with Japanese companies. But 
proponents believe the potential benefits far outweigh any commercial risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will offer unprecedented access to our military technology in exchange for 
some key dual-use technology for use in our defense," Kenneth S. Flamm, deputy 
assistant secretary of defense, said in an April speech to Japanese corporate 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
 While Washington will also be willing to buy technology, Flamm stressed that 
the focus is on technology barter deals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your most important participation incentive," he told members of Keidanren, 
the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, "is likely to be access to our 
defense technologies, because what we are talking about is long-term and 
unprecedented. We believe that these U.S. military technologies could have 
important civilian applications in . . . aerospace, space structures, 
satellites, sensors, software engineering, etc." 
</P>
<P>
 Flamm suggested that the U.S. and Japanese governments would primarily play 
roles as facilitators for technology swap deals made on a company-to-company 
basis between U.S. defense contractors and Japanese commercial firms, but that 
"no one will be forced by anyone to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 During Flamm's visit to Tokyo, "we reached an understanding with the Japanese 
that we will go forward to work on the TFT (Technology for Technology) policy," 
said a U.S. embassy official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The agreement 
is informal but is still a breakthrough, he said. "We have commitments from 
both MITI (the Ministry of International Trade and Industry) and JDA (the Japan 
Defense Agency) to earnestly support this initiative." 
</P>
<P>
 Shigeru Hatakeyama, deputy minister of the defense agency, confirmed that "an 
agreement to expand technical exchange in both directions" had been reached. 
Talks will now begin on concrete projects, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driving force behind the initiative is the rapid shrinking of the U.S. 
defense budget, the U.S. diplomat said, which has forced officials to acquire 
equipment in the most cost-efficient manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese firms, however, may prove unwilling to swap their most advanced 
technologies for anything less than access to American research with the most 
valuable commercial application. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, (Japanese companies) show interest because the U.S. must have so 
much advanced technology," Kiyoaki Aburaki, staff economist of Keidanren's 
defense production committee, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they don't know to what extent the U.S. will open its advanced technology 
to Japan, and also what kind of technology the Department of Defense wants in 
return. Everybody knows they want flat-panel displays or composite materials. 
But there are lots of types of composite materials and flat-panel displays." 
</P>
<P>
 As a business organization, "Keidanren's position is that U.S.-Japan 
technology cooperation is very important because of our security relations, and 
we would like to promote it as much as possible," Aburaki said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the technology in question belongs to individual companies. Firms that 
until now have dealt purely with civilian products may not want to risk their 
reputations by getting involved in U.S. military production unless the Japanese 
government takes steps to make it absolutely clear that everything they are 
doing is legal and proper, Aburaki said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Japanese public is very sensitive about defense, or arms, the army, navy 
or air force," he noted. "In the case of (non-defense) companies . . . I think 
their initial reaction will be worried. They are worried about how Japanese 
consumers see their companies, because a bad image of the company is reflected 
in great loss of profit in the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. diplomat acknowledged that the initial reaction from Japanese firms, 
which are concerned about the bottom line, has been cool. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand that," the diplomat said. "We are willing to trade our 
leading-edge technologies. . . . Basically, they could get some neat technology 
without needing to pay for it, and from that they could develop a better widget 
on their own." 
</P>
<P>
 Questions could arise in the United States about the wisdom of providing U.S. 
defense technology to Japanese corporations for them to try to commercialize 
for profit. 
</P>
<P>
 The last major defense technology deal the United States made with Japan -- 
co-development of the next-generation FSX jet fighter for Japan's air force -- 
precipitated protest in Congress in 1989. Critics charged that too much 
technology was being given to an economic competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 The diplomat, responding to this issue, asserted that given the current fast 
pace of change, advanced technologies retain their cutting-edge character for 
only a limited time. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential savings in defense procurement far outweigh any risk that U.S. 
technologies will turn Japanese firms into more formidable business competitors 
at the expense of American firms, he said.

 Unofficial Newspapers Silenced: Authorities in Shanghai have closed four 
publications distributing stock market news because they were not officially 
approved and were exploiting public enthusiasm for stock information, the 
official People's Daily said Friday.The publications that were closed were the 
Shanghai Stock Market News, Shanghai Market Express, Shanghai Market Express 
News and Weekly Finance. More than 100,000 copies of the four were seized, 
authorities said. The papers had published more than 2.09 million copies over 
the last six months. The official Shanghai Securities News, published by the 
Xinhua news agency and the city's securities exchange, is among the most 
popular newspapers in the city.

 Steep Real Estate Losses: Japan's three biggest real estate companies reported 
sharp declines in profits in the year ended March, 1994, and said they expected 
earnings to continue falling. Mitsubishi Estate Co. said its current profit 
fell 32.9% to $456 million in 1993-94 from a year earlier and forecast a 26.2% 
decline in profit for 1994-95.Mitsui Fudosan Co. Ltd. said it posted profit of 
$158 million for 1993-94, down 36.2% from a year earlier. It forecast a 27% 
decline in profit in 1994-95 from 1993-94. Sumitomo Realty & Development Co. 
said its profit fell 21.6% to $89.7 million in 1993-94 from a year earlier and 
expected a 19.6% decline in 1994-95 profit. Until recently, weak demand for new 
offices, competition and oversupply had forced realtors to offer discounted 
rents because many of them are stuck with projects planned in the "bubble 
economy" days of the late 1980s, analysts said.

 Bankrupt Companies' Debt Climbs: Japan's economic slump boosted the debt of 
bankrupt Japanese companies in April, pushing it up 2.9% from a year earlier to 
$3.75 billion, a debt research company said. But the number of bankruptcy cases 
fell 2.5% from a year earlier to 1,230, falling for the third straight month, 
Tokyo Commerce and Industry Research Co. said.

HOT JOBS; BUS DRIVING: ROUTE TO INDEPENDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judy Whittington had never driven anything larger than a car when she put in 
an application for a bus-driving job with the Orange County Transportation 
Authority in 1979. But with four children to rear, she needed a job that would 
pay well and have flexible hours, so she decided to give it a try. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I applied I didn't hear anything back for seven months," said 
Whittington, who was then employed by the Fountain Valley Police Department 
traffic division. "When they called, I wasn't absolutely sure I wanted to be a 
bus driver, but I thought I might like it better than giving parking tickets, 
so I accepted." 
</P>
<P>
 At first there were a lot of adjustments, such as memorizing routes, dealing 
with passengers and, of course, learning to maneuver the bus. But during her 14 
years as a driver, Whittington has found many things to like about her job, 
particularly the passengers. "Some have been riding the bus for years, and it 
always makes them so happy when I remember their names," she said. "A lot of 
seniors and handicapped people depend on the bus for transportation, and I've 
come to enjoy them most of all. It's good to see them getting out and doing 
what they can for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Whittington says that sometimes the job can be stressful, "especially if 
something puts you behind schedule in the morning and you have a bus full of 
passengers who need to get to work on time. But when you are driving a route 
you are in control, and as long as you get where you are supposed to go on 
time, there are no supervisors hovering over you." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to independence, Whittington, now 52, likes being able to set her 
own hours. The OCTA allows drivers to bid on shift assignments three times a 
year. "If you have enough seniority, you can set your own hours. If I wanted 
to, I could drop down to part time or work as much as 60 hours a week," she 
said. "It's the only job I've ever had where I had so much control over my 
hours and paycheck." OCCUPATION: Bus driver 
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: Operate buses on routes for schools, city or county 
transportation agencies or private companies. Drivers collect fares, issue 
transfers and help elderly or handicapped riders enter or exit the bus. They 
record and report mechanical problems and answer passenger questions about 
fares and routes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualifications: Most agencies or firms require that drivers be at least 21 
years old and have excellent driving records. Fluency in English is required; 
bilingual ability is a plus. A driver must pass a medical exam required by the 
Department of Transportation and be able to maneuver the bus and assist 
passengers. To become fully certified, a trainee must pass Class B commercial 
driver's license tests and become certified to carry passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: One of the 10 fastest-growing job fields in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prospects: By 1998, the number of bus drivers is projected to increase by 
17.8%, to 3,530. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: Driver trainees are paid $10 to $12 an hour. Experienced 
drivers can make as much as $17 an hour, depending on seniority. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: Drivers work independently, without constant supervision. Most enjoy 
the option of working day or night shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: There is very little interaction between drivers during shifts, and 
some drivers miss the camaraderie common to most work environments. Others 
report difficulty dealing with the public on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement:Drivers can advance to supervisory or field coordinator 
positions, where they help devise routes and maintain service quality. Some 
advance to administrative positions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "Some people ask: 'Isn't it hard driving a bus? Aren't the people 
awful to deal with?' and I remind them that there are difficult people in every 
job. In fact, the passengers are often the best part of my day. I don't have 
co-workers around to interact with, but I have lots of appreciative 
passengers." -- Judy Whittington, bus driver, Orange County Transportation 
Authority

'CHUNNEL' OPERATOR FACES CRUNCH GETTING ITS FINANCES IN ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eurotunnel PLC faces a crunch week in its troubled eight-year life as the 
English Channel tunnel operator scrambles to bring banks in line before asking 
long-suffering investors for a lifesaving share issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The market expects banks to cough up a grudging $1 billion of debt this week, 
with a stock rights issue of up to $1.36 billion possibly coming before the end 
of next. 
</P>
<P>
 That would take total costs of the world's biggest engineering project to 
nearly $16.6 billion, more than double the original budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Eurotunnel, though, refuses point-blank to say exactly how much it will ask 
shareholders to put up. 
</P>
<P>
 It also declined to comment on weekend news reports that banks were already 
considering deferring interest payments in case refinancing fails. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all speculation," a Eurotunnel spokeswoman said Sunday. "We don't wish 
to comment on where we are at the moment. Once the debt is finalized, then we 
will go out to shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
 The group has had a frantic last two months. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, it shelled out $1.66 billion to settle a bitter cost dispute with 
Transmanche Link, builders of the 31-mile undersea tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
 May 6 saw the tunnel's official opening by Britain's Queen Elizabeth and 
French President Francois Mitterrand, and the first trucks finally rolled 
through last Thursday -- a year late. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, the Financial Times newspaper reported that a reluctant European 
Investment Bank had agreed to pump in $75 million, and Germany's public sector 
Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau had also joined in. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of England lobbying has also pulled Japanese banks -- lenders of nearly a 
quarter of its $10.3-billion debt so far -- into line. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the way through, the bank has been kept in touch by the company and its 
banks. At times, we have been able to help them reach agreement," a Bank of 
England spokesman said of its efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Eurotunnel's money runs out in June, and it needs at least $1.66 billion to 
$1.81 billion to see it through to a projected cash break-even in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Add costs, extra interest and a cushion, and the market expects it to go for 
up to $2.42 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Eurotunnel's share price slumped to $5.63 on Friday as thoughts of the cash 
call, far higher than expected, began to start sinking in. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Eurotunnel's 633,000 shareholders are individuals expected to shun the 
issue, meaning underwriters are looking for a large discount -- up to 30%, one 
Sunday newspaper said.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: THOUGH NOT QUITE CHILD'S PLAY, PORTFOLIO OFFERS 
SOMETHING NEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With something on the order of 5,000 mutual funds available today, it's 
getting harder for fund companies to come out with unique products or services. 
</P>
<P>
 But a new portfolio from Chicago-based Stein Roe Mutual Funds does just that, 
and it also manages to target a neglected shareholder group: children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stein Roe Young Investor Fund, which opened May 9, has a dual mission. It 
sees itself as a vehicle for financing a child's future college education and 
as a way to get youngsters excited about the investment process. 
</P>
<P>
 The first angle is nothing new. All sorts of mutual funds can be used for 
college planning. Equity funds in particular work well for younger children 
because of the greater long-term returns associated with the stock market. More 
conservative bond and even money market portfolios make sense for teens who 
know they will need to drain the account within a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 The second angle, of trying to involve kids in the investment process, is 
unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Education that deals with investing, mutual funds and financial planning is 
underrepresented at the high school and junior high levels," says Kenneth W. 
Corba, one of the three portfolio managers for the Young Investor Fund and a 
former high school English teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Corba says his first definition of success with the Young Investor Fund would 
be to outperform the Standard & Poor's 500 index. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that, I'd like to light a spark or create an interest among kids in the 
stock market and individual companies around them," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The main way Stein Roe intends to do this is by holding recognizable stocks in 
the portfolio, especially "companies that appeal to or affect the lives of 
children or teen-agers," as the prospectus, or legal disclosure document, puts 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the bigger holdings -- Procter & Gamble, Microsoft and Motorola -- 
show that management reserves the right to interpret its mandate liberally. But 
more identifiable kid-related stocks such as Toys R Us, McDonald's, Walt Disney 
Co. and Coca Cola have also been included. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the holdings will be large growth companies characterized by higher 
profitability and lower dividend yields than the Standard & Poor's 500. But the 
fund isn't restricted from owning smaller stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're even looking to get some small-stock ideas from kids," says Corba. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund's budding capitalists will get a quarterly newsletter and an expanded 
annual report featuring games and articles designed for young investors. Other 
odds and ends will include an investment primer for teens and adults, and a 
short financial coloring book for younger children. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund's prospectus, it should be noted, is a bit easier to read than many 
such documents but is hardly Dr. Seuss material. 
</P>
<P>
 The Young Investor Fund is marketed directly by Stein Roe ((800) 403-KIDS), 
without a sales charge or load. The company estimates the fund's operating 
expenses will run 1% annually, which would make it a bit less costly than the 
average growth-stock portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 The minimum investment is $2,500, or $1,000 in a Uniform Transfers to Minors 
Act account, which is applicable in California. 
</P>
<P>
 UTMAs are an easy way to hold assets in a child's name under the supervision 
of a parent or other adult custodian. The money in the account, even if given 
by an adult, becomes the kid's property, which means he or she might decide not 
to use it for educational purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 The child gains access to the money upon becoming an adult. Before then, the 
custodian oversees the account. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a potential tax advantage to putting assets in a child's name. 
Depending on the youngster's age and investment income, some or all of that 
income might be tax-free, and the rest could be taxable at the child's lower 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Stein Roe's product joins a short list of funds that have been designed for 
under-age shareholders. Of these, Twentieth Century Giftrust, based in Kansas 
City, Mo., remains the most unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 This no-load fund gives new meaning to the idea of investing for the long 
haul. Money placed in the fund can't be touched for 10 years or until the child 
becomes an adult, whichever is further down the road. Donors can specify even 
lengthier investment commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of these restrictions, Giftrust ((800) 345-2021) has been slow to 
catch on. It counts just $179 million in assets despite having the No. 1 
performance record for any mutual fund over the 10 years through March 31, 
1994. The fund holds aggressive growth stocks for which a long horizon is 
generally desirable. The minimum investment is $250. 
</P>
<P>
 One more wrinkle: Giftrust itself, rather than parents or kids, pays the taxes 
on yearly dividends and capital gains out of the fund's assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Twentieth Century also has a separate UTMA plan, in which the company will 
automatically shift an investor's money from its Select stock fund to a money 
market portfolio as the youngster nears college age. 
</P>
<P>
 A few other mutual fund groups offer college planning incentives, typically in 
the form of lower minimum investments. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Boston-based Fidelity Investments ((800) 544-8888) drops the 
normal $2,500 minimum on its Asset Manager, Blue Chip Growth and Growth & 
Income funds to $1,000 for people setting up UTMA accounts. It also waives the 
normal 3% sales charge on the latter two funds (Asset Manager is a no-load 
portfolio anyway). 
</P>

 The Investment Company Institute has proposed voluntary guidelines that it 
predicts will help eliminate confusion over inconsistent use of A, B, C and D 
classes of shares among fund companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington-based trade organization is recommending that front-end load 
funds be designated as A shares, while B shares would be those on which an 
investor pays a 12b-1 fee in combination with a declining back-end charge. The 
C and D shares would be two alternate types of "level-load" pricing schemes 
making use of 12b-1 fees; a front-end charge would apply to the D shares but 
not the C. 
</P>
<P>
 There also would be less-costly X and Y classes of shares, reserved for 
institutional investors and fund company employees, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Still confused? Then consider no-load funds, on which multiple classes of 
shares don't apply.

 The stock market might still look expensive to a lot of people, but fund 
companies continue to introduce new portfolios with a bargain-hunting slant. 
One such product is the 4-month-old John Hancock Special Value Fund, 
headquartered in Boston but managed by Charles H. Womack of NM Capital 
Management in Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite an emphasis on neglected, out-of-favor stocks trading at low 
price-to-book values, Womack says he's still finding plenty of companies in 
which to invest. Favorites include Boeing, Precision Castparts, Adolph Coors 
and the Brown Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Womack says some of the better buys are among smaller stocks. "That's where 
we're finding the values."

 He's also predicting upside earnings surprises this year and next.

JAZZ REVIEWS; 'RENEGADE GENTLEMAN' LIVES UP TO HIS MONIKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a new, tougher Larry Carlton on thescene these days. But that doesn't 
mean the old Carlton -- the one heard on Steely Dan's "Kid Charlemagne," the 
one who has kept the contemporary jazz charts decorated with cleanly picked, 
happy-sounding music for the past 15 years -- has disappeared entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Carltons were on hand at the Coach House during the first of two shows 
the guitarist played Friday: the hard-edged, blues-minded electrician heard on 
his latest recording, "Renegade Gentleman," and the sweet-toned melodic master 
whose career was summed up in the 1990 anthology "Collection." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the two, the outlaw Carlton is by far the more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even Carlton's appearance was tough as he took the stage. Gone are the smooth, 
long-haired good looks of the '80s. Instead, this Carlton has short-cropped, 
thinning hair and a tight, little mustache. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a dark sleeveless vest that exposed formidable biceps, and 
occasionally clutching a smoldering cigarette while he played (though no one 
else in the house was allowed to smoke), he looked more like one of Brando's 
hoodlum buddies in "The Wild One" than the family man and session giant that 
his fans have come to love. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Renegade Gentleman" title neatly sums up this dichotomy. And though it 
seemed a bit strange to hear the roguish-looking guitarist picking out the 
sweet harmonies of his standby "Smiles and Smiles To Go," there was enough of 
the new, more serious Carlton to keep those who have soured on the old, tired 
Carlton happy. 
</P>
<P>
 The best of those moments came in the middle of the show as he delved into 
"R.C.M.," a Ray Charles-inspired number from the new album. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton filled the county-flavored exercise with fuzz-tone and twang that 
carried the uneasy air of some of guitarist Bill Frisell's out-West offerings. 
Technical mastery took a back seat to mood setting, as Carlton rifled through 
an improvisational stretch that was blunt, edgy and nasty from note to note. 
</P>
<P>
 From there it was on to an untitled blues that featured some clipped B.B. 
King-styled lines before modulating with rough-hewn tones and a big, 
in-your-face climax heightened by the organ play of keyboardist Greg Mathieson. 
Surprisingly, the audience, which seemed most pleased with the older numbers 
until this point, gave the guitarist his biggest ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The raunchy blues mood continued even when Carlton dragged his 11-year-old son 
Travis on stage to show off his chops. The kid struck up a John Lee Hooker 
riff, then soloed in an I'm-still-learning way that gave the number a decided 
garage-band flavor. This too, was greeted with wild acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton even gave his feel-good piece "Rio Samba" a dissonant edge in places. 
"Strikes Twice," issued in 1988, found the guitarist applying his new, 
tough-guy image to the tune's keyboard wash and insistent, driving rhythm. As a 
measure of flexibility, he moved his three-piece backing band into "Tequila" 
when someone in the crowd called out for the old Carlton standby. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the better-known Carlton pieces pulled from the past seemed like 
mere exercises. "Minute By Minute" was done by the book, with the guitarist 
having little to say during the easy-beat melody. A ballad dedicated to his 
wife had some pleasant passages but, as a whole, was largely unsatisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 In either mode, Carlton got good support from Mathieson, bassist Dave 
Carpenter and longtime drummer John Ferraro, who opened "Rio Samba" with a 
strong Latin feel. 
</P>
<P>
 But the country touches of "Renegade Gentleman," part of which was recorded in 
Nashville, were largely missing from this performance. Next time, along with 
the tough-guy posing, maybe Carlton could put in some of the drawl that has 
made "Renegade Gentleman" his best effort of the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening act Coco Montoya went a long way toward setting the evening's blues 
mood with his Albert Collins-inspired guitar licks and no-nonsense musical 
presentation. The veteran John Mayall sideman has a strong way with a guitar 
solo, with thick, meaty notes chopped from strong riffs supplied by his 
three-piece backing combo. 
</P>
<P>
 Montoya's voice may lack in character, but he works hard to bring it some 
interest with occasional gruffness and an overall sense of sincerity. But his 
guitar playing is the real thing. Some record company should pick up his 
European release and bring his recorded work to blues fans in this country.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; MUSIC CAN'T DO ALL THE TALKING FOR HIMMELMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Winning over a concert audience comes so easily to Peter Himmelman that he 
seemed to be setting a self-imposed handicap for himself Saturday night at the 
Coach House just to make it a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first 65 minutes of his show, he held the clever, indefatigable, 
ever-entertaining tongue that makes him one of rock's most engaging 
between-songs extemporizers. Himmelman, who combines singer-songwriter and 
heartland rock sensibilities, might pose a threat to David Letterman if he ever 
decided to quit music and turn that tongue to talk TV.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he made the first half of his concert a shaddap-and-play affair, 
saying not a word between songs as he and his band barreled through his new 
album, "Skin," in its entirety. 
</P>
<P>
 That made for some heavy slogging in the early going. "Skin" (the eighth album 
in a recording career that dates back to 1980) is a concept album of sorts -- 
apparently Himmelman's reason for playing the whole thing nonstop. But it's not 
a well-developed concept. Himmelman sets out to describe what happens when the 
soul of a sleazy egotist is given a second chance through reincarnation, but he 
fails to stuff "Skin" with the flesh and bone of strong characterization. 
That's a fatal flaw for anyone with ambitions of giving rock some of the 
trappings of musical theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The show got off uncertainly as Himmelman and band coped with feedback 
problems and a sound mix that buried his lyrics. The album's opening, 
expository songs laid out the reincarnation motif, but didn't accomplish much 
else. They are way below par for Himmelman, who relies on strong melodies and 
affecting, openly emotional lyrics to provide a winning vehicle for a nasal and 
grainy voice that isn't about to carry a show on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 The saving grace of "Skin" is that Himmelman utterly loses interest in the 
reincarnation business once he gets Mr. Sleaze safely reborn about halfway 
through. That leaves him half an album to do what he always has done well -- 
present a musical/spiritual dialogue in which exalted moments of illumination 
arrive, then fall away to leave the searcher struggling for another glimpse of 
light. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Himmelman gained sure footing with two luminous ballads, "Shilo" and "Laugh My 
Beloved" -- the first a wedding song (and definitely no relation to the Neil 
Diamond "Shilo"), the second a father's hopeful blessing to his newborn child. 
Himmelman is often at his best writing about the most intimate bonds between 
parents and children, husbands and wives. If he wants to do a conceptual piece, 
a musical suite centered on the family might be the way for him to go. 
(Himmelman's best album, "Flown This Acid World," is particularly rich in fine 
songs that portray how families form, grow and are sustained). 
</P>
<P>
 Once on course, "Skin" worked well because it follows Himmelman's typical ebb 
and flow. After the hope and warmth of "Shilo" and "Laugh My Beloved" came 
chill emotional weather, storms of anguish, and a resolution in which hope and 
trouble could coexist. 
</P>
<P>
 The music was well executed by a tight band whose core -- keyboards player 
Jeff Victor, bassist Al Wolovitch and drummer Andy Kamman -- has been together 
since the 1970s, when they started out with Himmelman in Minneapolis as the 
Sussman Lawrence Band. They were delicate on the ballads, and hit with a crisp, 
muscular impact on the rockers.  
</P>
<P>
 Wolovitch was a pivotal player, commanding an exceptionally firm, clear bass 
tone and a sharp melodic sense. Guitarist Greg Herzenach showed a sweet, 
lyrical touch on his solos, while Himmelman took some of the more assertive 
solos with a hard-slashing attack. A violinist, Jessica Green, provided 
typically wistful shadings that often came off as unneeded sweetening. Backing 
singer Kristin Mooney provided much-needed sweetening and cushioning for 
Himmelman. She also could muster a robust soul-tinged cry that recalled, albeit 
in a much toned-down, reined-in fashion, Merry Clayton's epic wailing on the 
Rolling Stones' "Gimme Shelter." 
</P>
<P>
 With "Skin" complete, we then got an hour-plus of fleshed-out Himmelman. This 
naturally talkative, surprising fellow simply took over the audience's 
attention and led it in whatever unpredictable direction he liked. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening's big comic set piece found the singer composing an impromptu 
silly ode to San Juan Capistrano. Advised by the audience that San Juan is 
famed for its swallows, he made up "an ornithological study" on the spot -- 
actually a florid ballad, incorporating rhymes like "The robins in Minnesota, 
they wish they could floata, to San Juan." Himmelman finished with a flourish, 
a vibrato-heavy crooner's crescendo worthy of Julio Iglesias. 
</P>
<P>
 Himmelman's chat was more than just entertaining shtick. It formed a 
lighthearted bridge that allowed outright musical jests (the bird ballad, and 
an improbable medley of Lynyrd Skynyrd, Stevie Wonder and Black Sabbath bits) 
to stand alongside his always-serious album selections without creating a 
grinding clash of gears.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Himmelman pulled off an impressive balancing act as he 
described two of the most painful episodes of his life -- his father's funeral, 
and the day he broke off with his fiancee of 11 years, leaving her screaming in 
a New York City street. He invested those anecdotes with ironic wit, but never 
callousness, as he established amid the fun-time atmosphere appropriately 
thoughtful backdrops for the songs "Tremble" and "Crushed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Coach House audience probably wouldn't have minded a full two hours of 
this charming-and-disarming approach. If Himmelman had incorporated some 
between-songs storytelling in "Skin," and dropped some of its weaker songs in 
favor of more of his primo stuff, the late-running evening would have been just 
about perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Himmelman, Kevin Montgomery offered a set weighted heavily toward 
rueful ballads about romances plagued by suspicion and enforced distance, among 
other obstacles and flaws. That might sound like a formula for sameness, but 
Montgomery's high tenor voice registered such a sweetly alluring plaint that he 
could have gone on pouring his poor heart out all night and few would have 
minded. 
</P>
<P>
 There's more kick to the Nashville-bred, Los Angeles-based singer's debut 
album, "Fear Nothing," thanks to help from such accomplished country-rock 
guitar heroes as John Jorgenson and Al Perkins. But Montgomery alone worked 
fine, thanks to his knack for low-keyed, slightly absurdist humor (touring with 
Himmelman must offer some good ideas on that score). 
</P>
<P>
 With a voice that's a cross between Marshall Crenshaw's and Roger McGuinn's, 
Montgomery held the audience rapt. He said he was fighting a sore throat, but 
each reedy chorus came through firm and clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Amie Bovee, an Orange County-based folkie, opened with a well-received 
acoustic set. Her singing is her strength, marked by a tawny, Christine 
McVie-like hue, but with more of an assertive edge.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's missing from this coffeehouse veteran's act are the subtle touches. She 
backed herself with bland, redundant strumming -- woodshedding or recruiting a 
lead guitarist partner would be in order. Bovee's lyrics tended to be strings 
of commonplace declarations that stated feelings and left it at that.  
</P>
<P>
 She carried several confessional songs on the strength of conviction alone, 
but as personal as some songs were in their subject matter, they didn't have 
the distinctive twists and surprising angles that come with a deeply personal 
songwriting voice.

JAZZ REVIEWS; PLAYERS HIT HIGH NOTES AT FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Contrast was the watchword for Saturday's edition of the second annual Orange 
County Art & Jazz Festival.  
</P>
<P>
 With a mix of college and high school bands sharing the stage with 
professional outfits playing mainstream, contemporary and Latin sounds, Day 2 
of the three-day affair was a rewarding mix of forms, abilities and styles that 
spoke to the diversity of the art form called jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 A more scenic location for an outdoor festival is hard to imagine. Held on the 
grounds of the Fullerton Arboretum, the park-like setting gave the affair the 
feeling of a garden party. The open-air bandstand -- framed by palms and backed 
by a lagoon, where turtles sunned themselves among the reeds and snowy egrets 
waded the shallow waters in search of fish -- was bathed in sunlight as 
temperatures crept into the 80s. Attendees competed for space under a 
scattering of shade trees to protect themselves from the relentless sun. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the heat was saxophonist Dan St. Marseille's quintet. Though it was 
only noon, his pianist Cecilia Coleman had already worked one gig at Disneyland 
and had two more to make after this appearance. Coleman gave her usual 
excellent performance, rich with the kind of sensitivity and swing that makes 
her one of Southern California's most rewarding keyboardists. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Marseille, just back from two weeks of playing clubs in Paris, pushed his 
tenor through a selection of neo-bop pieces in sparkling style. His own 
"Claxography," a piece written for jazz photographer William Claxton, found him 
especially agile. Trumpeter Steve Huffsteter, a member of Horace Silver's band, 
proved a worthy foil on trumpet, complementing St. Marseille on theme 
statements, adding Lee Morgan-like improvisations that wound along in narrative 
style. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping the heat on later in the day, the festival's All Star Band brought 
together six respected musicians in an unrehearsed program that recalled the 
1950s and '60s glory days of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by trumpeter Jeff Bunnell, the band, individually and collectively, made a 
good showing on numbers including Cedar Walton's "Ugetsu," Joe Henderson's "The 
Kicker" and Bobby Timmons' "Moanin'." 
</P>
<P>
 The front line of trombonist Alex Iles, Bunnell and saxophonist Bob Sheppard 
(who was seen last year with keyboardist Lyle Mays and on the Steely Dan tour) 
re-created the Messengers sound nicely while guitarist Higgins provided the 
pianoless combo its harmonic support. Isles stood out on Horace Silver's 
"Gregory Is Here," while both Sheppard and Bunnell took fine improvisations on 
Wayne Shorter's "This One Is for Albert." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Iles, a veteran of employment with Maynard Ferguson and 
Woody Herman, let the Fullerton College Big Band (which worked without its 
director) know what it's like to jam with pros. They traded licks on a handful 
of numbers including Dave Metzger's "Would You Like Fries With That?" After his 
own smoothly crafted solo, Iles exchanged lines with trombonist Francisco 
Torres, who managed to respond well to the veteran's play. Other standouts in 
the Fullerton ensemble included saxophonists Dave Shoop, Ernie Munoz and Joshua 
Fox (who served as de facto director), bassist Holly Ruzicka and pianist Dan 
Myers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Underscoring the event's diversity were two of the day's later acts. Trumpeter 
Steve Crum's Secret Circle Project mixed contemporary stylings (his own "Know 
It, I Wrote It") with standard tunes given modern twists (Gerry Mulligan's 
"Bernie's Tune"). Crum and saxophonist Dave Moody were bolstered by fine play 
from guitarist Michael Higgins, keyboardist Quinn Johnson, drummer Steve 
DiStanislao and bassist Chris Colangelo. 
</P>
<P>
 Crum's clever "Maple Road 332," inspired by reruns of "The Andy Griffith 
Show," had a Latin feel and hints of the situation comedy's whistled theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Violinist Susie Hansen's salsa-fired octet closed up with strong rhythms on 
numbers from such notables as Tito Puente and Smokey Robinson as well as 
Hansen's originals. 
</P>
<P>
 The band, which has a way of bringing a contemporary feel to its 
Latin-inspired numbers, had little luck coaxing people off their seats to 
dance, but not for lack of trying. With three percussionists pushing the beat, 
Hansen's set was more notable for its rhythmic strengths than the depth of its 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19-piece Los Altos High School Big Band, directed by Don Gunderson, gave a 
competent performance that featured ambitious arrangements and a nice solo 
turn.  
</P>
<P>
 The band sounded lively on the upbeat Matt Harris tune "North Shore Morning," 
then moved on to an in-the-pocket treatment of "Groove Knot," featuring tenor 
saxophonist Vince Hizon. Alto saxophonist Daniel Silva was featured on a bouncy 
arrangement of "St. Louis Blues" that also showcased the muted trumpet sounds 
of Bryan Crain. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's only disappointment was the turnout, with fewer than 200 people 
surrounding the bandstand at any one time. Home-grown events such as this, 
especially one that includes ensembles from area schools and colleges, make a 
valuable contribution to the local scene and deserve support.

 More Stern Fines? Radio personality Howard Stern's on-air musings have his 
employer, Infinity Broadcasting Corp., facing an additional $200,000 in fines 
from federal regulators. The Federal Communications Commission late last week 
proposed $50,000 fines for each of four Infinity-owned stations that carry 
Stern's show: WJFK-AM, Baltimore; WXRK-FM, New York; WRSP-FM, Philadelphia; and 
WJFK-FM, Manassas, Va. Material from the show appears to be in violation of the 
FCC's indecency standards, an FCC spokeswoman said. More than $1 million in 
fines previously have been imposed on stations airing Stern.

 Talk of the Pueblo: The first Spanish-language radio prime-time talk show 
premieres today on KWKW-AM (1330), better known as "La Mejicana." Robert 
Arguello, a retired LAPD officer, will host "El Pueblo Opina" ("The Town 
Talks") Monday through Friday from 3-7 p.m. The show will focus on issues of 
interest to the Latino community such as immigration, AIDS and crime.

 Seeing Double: It has already been noted that CBS and NBC have both scheduled 
Chicago-based medical dramas at 10 p.m. Thursdays this fall. But there are a 
couple of other scheduling anomalies coming up elsewhere in television. On June 
26, PBS will begin a rerun of Ken Burns' acclaimed documentary series "The 
Civil War," while TNT will premiere the motion picture "Gettysburg." And 
starting Sept. 11, A&E launches a new series from CBS News, "20th Century," 
hosted by Mike Wallace and airing here opposite "60 Minutes," Wallace's 
longtime home. (There will also be a second airing each Sunday at 11 p.m.)

 Reporters From Generation X: The syndicated news show "American Journal" is 
looking for newly minted college grads to be on-air reporters for its new Road 
Trip segment, which will take a look at things happening across the country. On 
the assignment list: the World Series and the Academy Awards. The program's 
producers ask that those grads with "television-style looks, personality and 
presentation" send a short videotape with an introduction or produced story, 
and/or recent head shots, plus a brief essay explaining why they want the job 
to: Road Trip, "American Journal," 402 E. 76th St., New York, N.Y 10021, by

 From Across the Pond: The British series "Absolutely Fabulous" -- shortened to 
"AbFab" by the Britcom's fans -- may be too far out for PBS and A&E, but not 
for cable's Comedy Central. Described by April's Vanity Fair as a "riot of 
boozy, sexy fun," the series will be shown Sunday afternoons, with its American 
debut set for July 24. Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley star "as two 40ish 
chain-smoking, trend-chasing boozers/substance abusers who take the London 
fashion scene by storm."

IN SUPPORT OF WELL-CONCEIVED MUSIC -- OLD AND NEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It would be irresponsible of me not to answer the ridiculous charges leveled 
by Burt Goldstein in a Counterpunch, "New Music Merits Respect, Not Attack" 
(May 16), that mentions me by name four times. 
</P>
<P>
 To assume that the subtext of the Claire Rydell Counterpunch, "Composers Milk 
a Dead-End Aesthetic" (May 2), is a litany of the "evils of contemporary 
music," a position wrongly attributed to me, is not just irresponsible but a 
betrayal of the trust that students who come to UCLA have in professors to 
teach a fair and honest approach to 20th-Century art. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Rydell is my wife or not, she has her own opinions: Would I really 
condemn university education in music when I have been teaching it at the 
university for more than 25 years? It so happens that this spring quarter I am 
giving a 20th-Century Music Seminar that includes music of Ligeti, Lutoslawski, 
Cage, Carter and Xenakis, not exactly a reactionary list of contemporary 
composers. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein misrepresents my role in the degrees of two of the composers on the 
concert: I had peripheral contact with the composers alluded to in Goldstein's 
article.  
</P>
<P>
 In all honesty, I did not see Rydell's article until it appeared May 2. 
</P>
<P>
 The real issue is that, probably, universities around the country award many 
more degrees than there are talented composers, and many students go to 
graduate school to learn about the art of music through theory, history and 
composition. This education does not mean that they are artists: I teach 
composers with a wide variety of musical styles and never tell them what is 
appropriate or what is evil. I am only interested in communicating 
compositional skills to those who arrive at UCLA with a primitive grasp of the 
art, and leave with some degree of professionalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Last, Goldstein assumes that I am in competition with the Independent 
Composers Assn. This charge is the most laughable of all. The art of music can 
stand any number of well-written and moving compositions, whatever the style. 
He almost gives the impression of "not only must I win, but you must lose." His 
position is not only poor sportsmanship, but it is anti-art and definitely 
implies a kind of predatory world in music that simply does not exist, in 
general. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has had contact with me knows that I support good music that is 
well-conceived and decry incompetently written drivel that ignores the 
technical limitations of the instruments or the subtleties of a solid musical 
structure.  
</P>
<P>
 In any art, in any century, probably 90% of the works executed are consigned 
to the dustbin because they do not reflect the Zeitgeist of the culture of the 
perfection of human nature. Correspondingly, the 10% represents the best of any 
culture and passes on the necessary cultural identity. In contemporary music, 
time will sweep away most of what we hear: I would not think of getting in the 
way of this necessary evolutionary process. To do so would be irresponsible of 
me as a professor of music.

THE END OF B&W DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I really hate to get sucked into a debate as trivial as the year the 
black-and-white era ended, but, once and for all, it was 1967 ("B&W Film After 
Color," Counterpunch Letters, May 16). That was the year that 1) the Motion 
Picture Academy stopped awarding separate Oscars for B&W and color in the 
cinematography, art direction and costume design categories; and 2) the three 
major TV networks broadcast their last monochrome shows in prime time. Those, 
alas, were the days; now the only place that regularly shows black-and-white is 
MTV.

WEEKEND REVIEWS; DANCE; COMPELLING VISIONS IN 'BORDERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Superficially a showcase for what a program note called "the great cultural, 
ethnic and artistic diversity that is Los Angeles," the "Dance Without Borders" 
series at the Japan America Theatre over the weekend had an unacknowledged 
unity worth considering. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the company leaders/choreographers were gay men and, in a better world 
than this, the three-night event would have been an occasion for gay pride -- a 
testament to the dazzling range, innovation and influence of homosexual 
modernism. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, however, diversity means race and even artists aren't allowed to 
belong to more than one minority -- at least not on major stages. 
</P>
<P>
 Ending Sunday with Donald Byrd's full-evening ensemble piece "Bristle" 
(reviewed earlier), the series proved especially memorable for its solos. On 
Friday, Rudy Perez projected AIDS consciousness as a crisis of faith in the 
brooding "Remain in Light" ("Can I Bear All the Red Ribbons") from 1991. Using 
a rope rosary and a strip of crimson cloth, he numbly measured his despair and 
then -- in a passage as horrific as its model in Martha Graham's "Cave of the 
Heart" -- desperately tried to devour it. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Jeffrey Grimaldo danced Perez's sardonic 1993 "Agenda," 
ricocheting from statements of vulnerability to increasingly rigid expressions 
of control that culminated in a lifeless, mechanical machismo. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally obsessed with issues of control and also, arguably, with unyielding 
concepts of manhood, "Spacetimegravity" on Friday found Mehmet Sander 
attempting to execute the same headstands, flips and full-force body-slams on 
three different surfaces: a flat gymnastic mat, a ramp at a 45-degree angle and 
a wall straight up from the floor. Of course, he succeeded -- heroically. 
</P>
<P>
 The first part of Naoyuki Oguri's "Protestation: Silent Shout" seemed a 
demonstration of the fierce concentration and amazing physical displacements of 
Japanese butoh. Bald, earth-colored, and wearing only a genital sock, this 
former pupil of the great Min Tanaka looked new to his body, trying out 
grotesque systems of motion suggesting some primordial creature walking upright 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 A sequence with a large mirror linked the audience to Oguri's dark view of 
physicality and seemed more conventionally choreographic in form. And the 
performance remained unforgettable -- making the deafening accompaniment 
needless. Anyone can turn up the volume to full -- and, sooner or later at 
"Dance Without Borders," nearly everyone did. But who else can move like this? 
</P>
<P>
 If Long Nguyen's new "Still" solo on Saturday introduced extremes of balance 
that appeared nothing less than metaphysical ordeals, the solo suddenly 
abandoned this focus for diversionary runs across the stage with a billowing 
fabric held overhead. You could recognize glints of Anna Pavlova and some 
modern dance pioneers in this veil sequence, but Nguyen's 1993 trio, "Common 
Love," proved far more satisfying in its mastery of mood, structure and 
musicality. 
</P>
<P>
 Set to arrangements of British folk songs, "Common Love" suggested 
relationships in its duets and a whole landscape when Nguyen danced through a 
thicket of legs belonging to Jennifer Kim and Phyllis Gomer. But the highlight 
was surely a quicksilver duet for Nguyen and Gomer full of imaginative lifts 
and magical transitions in and out of unison. 
</P>
<P>
 Three group pieces by Frit and Frat Fuller for their KIN Dance Company ended 
the Saturday program in a blaze of pop-dance flamboyance. Products of both 
CalArts and Hollywood, the Fullers combine the accessibility and technical 
flair of commercial dance with thematic preoccupations of the avant-garde. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously reviewed, their 1992 all-male showpiece "Stomp" touches briefly on 
gays in the military but mostly depicts young America's estrangement from 
gung-ho patriotism. Evolving from versions seen in the "Voices in Motion" 
series, "Pale Forest" portrays two kinds of urban desperation: among the 
homeless and among those with more money but who feel equally trapped on our 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Their new "Cell-Block 'A' " again explores being trapped -- and again shows 
men turning to one another in moments of deep need. The Fullers' big, bold jazz 
style may come too close to "Jailhouse Rock" slickness, but they cleverly use 
contrasting movement languages to objectify racial and cultural differences -- 
and then inventively fuse them in a statement of tolerance and growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Ending the Friday program, Rachel Rosenthal's 1991 performance art vehicle 
"Filename: FUTUREFAX" doesn't belong on a dance series. However, this evocation 
of a grim future allows Rosenthal to undercut her grandiose earth-mother or 
queen-bitch roles by portraying herself as a garrulous coot with a wicked 
tongue and a deranged amusement at the fatal follies of mankind. 
</P>
<P>
 Set on her 86th birthday, A.D. 2012 (with a flash-forward to even more 
frightening prospects in 2092), Rosenthal's one-act solo does evolve into a 
lament for human arrogance, but most of the time the sorrow is personal -- for 
her world, her life -- and all the more effective for its intimacy.

WEEKEND REVIEWS; POP; YANNI GETS LARGE SOUND FROM HAPPY BAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You've got to give Yanni credit for one thing. He's probably keeping more 
first-rate musicians employed this summer than any organization this side of 
the Boston Pops. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And the 40-piece orchestra he brought to the Universal Amphitheatre on Friday 
and Saturday seemed eager to reward him for their three months of steady 
employment by performing with a precision and enthusiasm rarely heard on the 
pop music stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Yanni need an ensemble this large? Probably not. His music -- often 
described, not always accurately, as New Age -- is based primarily on romantic 
melodies interspersed with highly energetic Mediterranean rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
 His regular group, featuring the fiery violin of Karen Briggs, generally 
handles it quite nicely, but the addition of full-scale orchestral timbres, 
arranged for the most part by conductor Shardad Rohani, added both emotional 
intensity and panchromatic colorations to the music. Yanni's decision to travel 
with the same band of players, instead of picking up local sidemen at each 
location, has clearly produced elegant musical results. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's program was very similar to that performed on his current hit 
recording and video, "Yanni Live at the Acropolis." But even without the 
magical presence of the spotlighted Parthenon in the distance, the concert 
emphasized the importance of the spirit and the soul of Greece in Yanni's 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he prefers to identify himself as a citizen of the world rather than 
a Greek, Yanni's music is most appealing when it pulsates with the off-center 
rhythms and keening melodies of the Peloponnesus. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently using a sampled sound much like that of the bouzouki, Yanni played 
his improvisations -- especially in the up-tempo numbers -- with an articulated 
phrasing typical of Greek music. Even his slower pieces, despite their soaring 
sentimentality, tended to avoid harmonic complexity in favor of insinuating 
modal lines. 
</P>
<P>
 In its best moments, the music, in combination with a stage set that suggested 
ancient Grecian monuments and an atmospheric lighting scheme, called up 
strikingly effective images reaching well beyond the touchy-feely 
characteristics commonly associated with New Age. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was a problem, it was the tendency of Yanni's audio engineers to 
prefer the bass, keyboards and drums over the richer sounds of the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 With his mane of jet-black hair and his trademark white outfits, Yanni played 
the matinee idol to perfection, bounding on stage, throwing kisses to the 
crowd, responding to questions (mainly about his love life) and indulging the 
fans' good-natured affection. It was a commanding performance from an artist 
who appears poised to make the leap to the superstar level.

COUNTERPUNCH: 'WHEN A MAN' RINGS TRUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART FISCHOFF, Stuart Fischoff, Ph.D, is on the faculty of Cal State Los 
Angeles, where he specializes in media and clinical psychology. He is West 
Coast correspondent for Psychology Today and is a film critic for numerous 
psychological publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time that I can recall, a movie is accurately and realistically 
reflecting the effects of alcoholism, which I see in my clinical practice. So I 
cannot agree with film critic Kenneth Turan's dismissal of "When a Man Loves a 
Woman" as contrived and lacking in restraint (" 'Woman': Days of Wine and 
Turmoil," Calendar, April 29). 
</P>
<P>
 The mosaic of problems presented in the film are neither contrived nor 
excessive for families with an alcoholic parent. On the contrary, the dramatic 
momentum of raw nerve endings is an honest reflection of the disrupting effects 
of alcoholism on a family. The film is particularly effective in showing the 
truth of the psychologically shattering aftermath of detoxification rather than 
going for dramatic hyperbole or happy-ever-after, common missteps of most 
Hollywood substance-abuse films. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, there is little that is artificial about Alice and Michael Green 
(played by Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia, whose performances received well-deserved 
praise from Turan) or their children. And there is much that is totally real: 
The reality of prematurely adultified children and of job-threatening 
irresponsibility and life-threatening drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
 More reality bubbles off the screen when Alice exposes her fear that she may 
not be as funny and interesting sober as when she is buzzed by alcohol. Even 
more reality glides along the arc of the insidious transformation of Alice's 
feelings from inferiority to in-group superiority, a turnabout all too common 
with alcoholics in recovery. Her Betty Ford Clinic-AA cultish smugness 
stiff-arms everyone close and makes her spouse feel that if he is not sharing 
the problem, he can't be part of the solution. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the commonplace yet horrendous problems that, as the movie 
accurately implies, often destroy families on the cusp of rising expectation. 
They are certainly not plot-wires of audience manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The frustration of a loving husband who suddenly finds himself accused of 
being an enabler when, in other circumstances, with other spouses, he would be 
lauded as a take-charge, caring husband, is a plot-beat that is breathtaking 
and heartbreaking at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Alice makes Michael feel wrong for being everything that he thought was right 
about himself. He is wrong for being self-confident, wrong for not suffering 
alcoholism and wrong for not having to go through the painfully wrenching 
recovery process. 
</P>
<P>
 Must all movies about alcoholics be clones of "Ironweed" to be realistic 
portrayals? The alcoholic's song is sung as plaintively on Knob Hill as it is 
on Western Avenue. Same notes, different octaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-writers Ron Bass and Al Franken have written that rare oxymoron -- a 
"Hollywood" movie with biting psychological reality. They have accomplished an 
illuminating piece of filmmaking that can educate as well as entertain.

THEATER REVIEW; STALE TEXT HURTS STATIC 'SHADOWS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago, director Michael Arabian made an old play seem new with his 
dynamic interpretation of "Romeo and Juliet" at CBS Studio Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Arabian has returned to the same studio to stage "A History of Shadows," 
about four gay men's experiences inside the closet. This time, a new play seems 
old. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike last year's production, "Shadows" stays inside a soundstage; there 
aren't any outdoor scenes. And even the soundstage isn't used nearly as 
inventively as Arabian used it last year. His sense of showmanship is missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Lachman's script -- all fiction -- is framed around oral historian 
Steve (Larry Cox), a gay man in his 20s. From the perspective of 1985, he tells 
us about his just-published collection of reminiscences by a group of gay men 
who have known each other more than half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he takes us back into his interviews with the randy actor Wesley (Robert 
Mandan), the wry movie composer Carl (Bernie Kopell), the cautious accountant 
Robert (William Christopher) and the flamboyant interior designer Billy (Jack 
Beckerman). 
</P>
<P>
 The four interviews are fragmented into an ongoing narrative, with Steve 
darting back and forth from one man to another, as they hold court in their 
living rooms. Although the quartet occasionally gets together for flashbacks, 
generally this nearly three-hour production is too static. 
</P>
<P>
 It's made worse by the lack of intimacy in a cavernous soundstage. The only 
advantage offered by the venue is that it provides room for a giant screen 
behind the actors. Mark Friedman's projected period imagery accompanies the 
text. But it's not particularly imaginative, and sometimes it distracts more 
than it adds. The production might seem more focused in a smaller hall, with 
fewer projections on a smaller screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Most regular theaters also would offer better sight lines. Here the seating 
consists of folding chairs, most of them on one level (and some of them without 
padding), so that those who aren't in the front row or the elevated back row 
may have to crane their necks. 
</P>
<P>
 The material sometimes engages, but sometimes just meanders. At times it 
resembles a long pitch for a miniseries more than a play. 
</P>
<P>
 In the emotional highlight, at the end of the first act, Carl remembers the 
pain of being unable to see his boyfriend off to war -- and recalls what 
happens when the boyfriend doesn't come back. It's an anecdote that movingly 
illustrates the cost of staying in the shadows. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Lachman is careful not to paint the men as mere victims. They're generally 
satisfied with their lives. They regard each other as family, and they rally 
around each other at key moments. Near the end, the script obliquely raises the 
provocative question of whether the shadowy past wasn't even preferable to the 
AIDS-plagued present. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the play's momentum suffers from the men's overall sense of 
contentment. And the script strays too often from the theme that's announced in 
the title. 
</P>
<P>
 Lachman adapted a novel by Robert C. Reinhart, but he used a very 
docudramatic, nonfictional style. So why didn't he dig up actual case histories 
instead of made-up ones? In this format, the "true story" label might add an 
extra dollop of impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The actors, three of them familiar from popular TV series, often enliven the 
text, though most of them don't look as old as their characters would have been 
in 1985. If it's a little hard to believe they were all such great friends, 
especially Christopher's odd man out, that's a problem with the script as much 
as with the cast. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEW; NEW STRAIN OF 'FAME'? NOT EXACTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Fame," at the Alex Theatre, could have been called "Same." 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews, "Fame" creator David De Silva claims this "Fame" is not an 
adaptation of the 1980 movie about a New York performing arts high school. This 
one is set in the early '80s, after the movie was released. There are different 
songs and different characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Different in names, yes. But in fact most of the characters are strikingly 
similar to their movie forebears. And the changes in the names merely epitomize 
the level of cliche this show stays on. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Vegas. Carmen Diaz. Tyrone Jackson. Schlomo Metzenbaum. You get three 
guesses as to which two of these are hot-blooded Latinos, which one is the 
rebellious black dancer who can't read (just like in the movie), which one is 
the Jewish prodigy. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire structure of Jose Fernandez's book apes the movie, following a 
group of kids from the initial auditions through their senior year. Once again 
a girl and a boy in the acting program kinda like each other, except the boy is 
kinda gay (but only kinda). 
</P>
<P>
 The Latina singer is much more of a stereotype here -- she wears hot pants and 
boots, wiggles a lot, and not only flirts with the outside world but even ruins 
her life by going to, gulp, L.A. -- seen here as Gomorrah compared to good old 
Gotham. First, though, she gets to sing the Dean Pitchford/Michael Gore title 
song that Irene Cara made famous. 
</P>
<P>
 Though that song is the score's only actual import from the movie, the big 
group numbers by Steven Margoshes and Jacques Levy sound as if they could have 
been in the movie. But the smaller numbers are a little more original. 
</P>
<P>
 The major update is a rap solo for Tyrone. Later, in a refreshing change of 
pace, Tyrone and his snooty ballerina friend (another pickup from the movie) do 
a little Astaire/Charisse pas de deux that's like nothing in the film. There 
also are two stage-oriented comedy solos -- class clown Joe Vegas sings about 
his irrepressible erections, and a budding actress reminds herself to "Think of 
Meryl Streep." 
</P>
<P>
 One improvement: This show drops the overbearing parents and dramatizes a 
conflict between the dance teacher and the English teacher over the fate of 
Tyrone. It's written and acted with a heavy hand, but at least it adds a tiny 
bit of substance to the overall glitz. 
</P>
<P>
 The glitz is relentless. Although a big musical number is called "Hard Work," 
we don't see the kids working hard on their art. Most of them are skilled when 
they enter and no more skilled when they leave. From the beginning, the special 
effects recall a rock concert or Vegas. Who needs hard work when you have 
Michael Hallbert on lights? By contrast, the movie looked like a gritty 
documentary. 
</P>
<P>
 Lars Bethke's choreography moves muscles better than it moves the story. And 
while there is plenty of young singing talent on this stage, it's too bad the 
singers wear amplifying headsets throughout, as if they're telephone 
receptionists. Runar Borge's direction is loud and fast.

THEATER REVIEW; 'IRMA VEP' A CAMPY AND FLIPPANT ROMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles Ludlam had a prescription for writing plays that stands originality on 
its head: "Steal lines. Orchestrate platitudes. Hang them on some plot you 
found somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 No snob, he took whatever seemed useful from low or high sources with equal 
mockery. A pastiche in point is his 1987 camp comedy, "The Mystery of Irma 
Vep," which commits armed robbery on old horror movies, pulp fiction and 
classic literature. 
</P>
<P>
 The show, making its debut in the Los Angeles area, opened over the weekend in 
teasing, flippant style at the Laguna Playhouse's Moulton Theater. Ron Campbell 
and Anthony Forkush play all of its quick-change roles, women and men both, 
with lunatic zeal and sharp comic dexterity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Irma Vep" hijacks its main scenario from the Gothic thriller "Rebecca," and 
swipes moody details from "Wuthering Heights." A widowed British nobleman 
brings his second wife home to Mandacrest, where the memory of his first wife 
casts a shadow over the household's two servants and a lone wolf who howls on 
the heath in the dead of night. 
</P>
<P>
 The play also rifles "The Mummy" for a subplot about reincarnated lovers, 
burgles "The Wolf Man" for a lonely werewolf and filches wisecracks from 
Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde and Francois Villon. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly -- despite the parodistic glee of Ludlam's imagination, the wicked 
accuracy of the performers' caricatures and the unflagging speed of their 
whizz-bang costume changes -- the production takes the whole first act to build 
sustained comic momentum. But once it gains traction in the second, when the 
antic machinery seems most inspired, it's flat-out funny. 
</P>
<P>
 Both actors exhaust the ridiculous. Campbell does the servant Jane with 
imperious vulgarity and unstinting British intonation. Forkush's Lady Enid, the 
new wife of Lord Edgar, flutters like a vain coquette primping under her blond 
tresses. The pair also offer quaint songs in warbling falsetto. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the best moments involve sight gags to amplify the outlandish. 
Campbell, as Lord Edgar on safari in his pith helmet, gazes into the distance 
through a view finder: "Ah Egypt! It looks exactly as I pictured it!" Forkush 
goes from old stiff mummy to undulating belly dancer by a magic invocation: 
"Cairo! Cairo! Practor!" 
</P>
<P>
 Groan if you must. "Irma Vep" revels in that sort of humor. Meanwhile, 
director Jules Aaron relishes the chance to apply an affectionate overlay of 
music-hall manner and tacky props. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Mystery of Irma Vep," Moulton Theater, 606 Laguna Canyon Rd., Laguna 
Beach. Tuesdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m.; Saturday-Sunday matinees, 2 
p.m. Ends June 19. $16-$20. (714) 494-8021. Running time: 1 hour, 50 minutes.

MUSIC REVIEW; STYLISH HAYDN ENDS L.A. MOZART SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coming at the end of a long warm-up, Saturday night in the Wilshire-Ebell 
Theatre, Haydn's Symphony No. 82 ("The Bear") sounded like the masterpiece it 
is, as conducted brilliantly by Lucinda Carver and played with gusto by the Los 
Angeles Mozart Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 What came before -- works of Mozart, Dittersdorf and Respighi -- had been 
respectable, but on a measurably lower level of achievement marked by 
pedestrian tempos, dishwater textures and a general lack of luster. When Haydn 
arrived to save the evening, and close Carver's second full season as music 
director, he was welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Bold rhythms, incisive contrasts, tight ensemble and a fluid sense of 
continuity characterized this performance, played by the nearly three dozen 
Mozart Orchestra members with complete attentiveness to Carver's unmistakable 
gestures. Loving respect for Haydn seems to be her motto. 
</P>
<P>
 A certain flaccidity of focus seemed to keep Mozart's Serenade in D, K. 239 
("Serenata Notturna"), the concert opener, from its wonted impact. Solo lines 
emerged on time, yet proved unengaging in terms of energy or purpose. And a 
general lack of transparency dulled the total. 
</P>
<P>
 JoAnn Turovsky was the effortlessly virtuosic soloist in the recast Harp 
Concerto in A by Dittersdorf. The piece, transcribed (as Roger Lebow's bright 
program notes revealed) by Karl Hermann Pilley from a concerto originally for 
harpsichord, is certainly a cherishable relic of 1779. But it is debatable 
which of its positive attributes -- the composer's or the transcriber's -- are 
most to be admired. One listener would vote for the second-movement cadenza, 
which Lebow tells us was incontrovertibly written by Pilley. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 At mid-program, Respighi's Third Set of "Ancient Airs and Dances" showed the 
orchestra's accomplished strings in fine voice, if not optimally balanced. By 
the end of the piece, the friendly audience became confused about where it was, 
movement-wise -- the printed program had too much information -- and missed its 
chance to applaud.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; SOME MAJOR CUTS FROM SHONEN KNIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's easy to see why Kurt Cobain loved Shonen Knife so much. The Japanese 
female trio is an embodiment of the purity and innocence that the singer 
treasured and found so elusive in the pop music world. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobain was one of many peer-group patrons and admirers that the three women 
from Osaka have acquired along their path from offbeat cult item to fairly 
major cult item. Two others, the Bangles' Susanna Hoffs and the Go-Go's 
Charlotte Caffey, were part of the emcee team introducing Shonen Knife on 
Friday at the Palace. It was a big-time show for the group, and they responded 
with a typically fresh and unaffected performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a song about my favorite drink, tomato juice," said singer-guitarist 
Naoko Yamano, introducing "Tomato Head," which featured the show's one 
concession to theatrics -- two roadies dancing around wearing tomato 
headpieces. "This is a song about a cat," said bassist Michie Nakatani, 
announcing "I Am a Cat." 
</P>
<P>
 So it went, delivered with a tight, perky attack that recalled the Ramones' 
buoyant pop side. A sound problem left the guitar without much presence for the 
first part of the show, but it was full and powerful by the time the three 
women were dropping slow, lead-weight metal riffs and, with big grins, flashing 
the devil's-horn hand sign. Never had parody been more free of hostility.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; SLY MIXTURE FROM JUNIOR BROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The trip from Hank to Hendrix is a short one with Junior Brown at the wheel. 
The guitarist from Austin, Tex., plays traditional honky-tonk that is 
flawlessly authentic, but with enough accents of Jimi, surf and other styles to 
keep his music, and his audience, a little off-balance. 
</P>
<P>
 He brought that sly mixture to Jacks Sugar Shack over the weekend, serenading 
Friday's crowd with his warm baritone on witty and heartbroken odes to Ernest 
Tubb, the Highway Patrol and a singing janitor. But it was Brown's 
lightning-paced flourishes of bluegrass, blues, Hawaiian and newer genres that 
kept his old-style country music fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown plays a unique double-neck instrument of his own invention, pairing an 
electric six-string with a pedal steel. And he carried it with a relaxed, 
country suaveness, offering a blast from the timeless core of country music in 
this era of smoke machines and slick, crossover pop. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by a three-piece band that included his wife, guitarist Tanya Rae, 
Brown stepped completely outside the country oeuvre just once, for a searing 
medley of surfing and spying instrumentals. Soon enough, he was mixing things 
up again, playing Hawaiian slide on "Hillbilly Hula Gal," lovingly tying 
together the disparate strands of American guitar music. STEVE APPLEFORD

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; DEPECHE MODE WISELY GETS BACK TO ELECTRO-BEAT BASICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a night of improvements all around when Depeche Mode played the Glen 
Helen Blockbuster Pavilion on Saturday. They're subtle improvements, but steps 
in the right direction for both the band and the venue, which is beginning its 
second season.In each case it's a matter of efficiency -- a streamlined, warmer 
presentation in one case, better traffic flow and parking in the other.  
</P>
<P>
 Having made a special effects-laden tour last fall, the English quartet is now 
stripped down to its electro-beat basics, such as they are. If singer David 
Gahan's sexy gyrations are ever more incongruous alongside the band's 
essentially cold sound, they're also more human, as are the increased use of 
real guitar and -- best yet -- real drums! It's not exactly the Rolling Stones, 
but every bit of warmth counts as progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to be exactly like the Stones is sometimes the problem with 
second-billed Primal Scream. Formerly an intriguing mesh of Stonesy roots and 
psychedelic techno, the group has leaned heavily toward the former on its new 
album. But the show retained enough of the heady blend of rock, soul, gospel 
and techno-dance -- and frontman Bobby Gillespie is evolving into a personable 
enough leader -- that the band seems poised to forge a distinctive style from 
its identity crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the amphitheater itself, the addition of a temporary extra freeway exit 
(a permanent one is scheduled for next year), a more thorough traffic 
management team and steps to reduce dust levels in the dirt parking lot are all 
signs of progress, though there were some traffic jams inside at the restrooms 
and food service windows.  
</P>
<P>
 The real test will come next month when the Eagles perform, inaugurating the 
facility's new expanded capacity, doubled from 16,800 (the size for the Depeche 
show) to 35,000. STEVE HOCHMAN

TV REVIEW; 'SUBSTITUTE WIFE' A PIONEER LOVE STORY; FARRAH FAWCETT IS 
TRANSFORMED FROM PROSTITUTE TO BRIDE IN 19TH-CENTURY NEBRASKA. IT'S AN 
UNUSUALLY FRANK NETWORK FILM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Substitute Wife," a unique love story about sod-busting pioneers on a 
19th-Century Nebraska plain, features a frankness and sexual maturity rare for 
network movies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Co-starring Farrah Fawcett as a village prostitute who's transformed into a 
prairie bride, the movie's originality (from a terrific script by Stan Daniels) 
brings temporary luster to the network movie genre and NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 At times funny, daring, endearing and unpredictable, the production has the 
texture and flavor of Willa Cather's Nebraska fiction -- except that the values 
espoused in "The Substitute Wife" would shock most mortals both then and now. 
</P>
<P>
 A spirited prairie wife and mother of four (Lea Thompson) discovers she is 
dying from a suspected tumor. Determined to wrap up important matters with the 
time left her, she strikes out to find a marriageable woman to fill her place 
in the conjugal bed and on the farm in order that her husband (Peter Weller) 
won't be left to tend the land and raise their children by himself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's a time in the remote West when single women were a novelty and men found 
wives by literally mailing off for them. Fawcett's substitute wife, though, is 
no demure mail-order bride. She's a "good whore," she declares with an edge of 
pride and disdain. "That's why I can compete with girls half my age." 
</P>
<P>
 The husband's reaction to his wife's eye-opening selflessness and the 
prostitute's arrival at his door is one of the movie's ample surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Weller's quiet, oaken-like solidity (except when he's having congress with 
first Thompson and then Fawcett) is brushed with humor and virility. Thompson 
is a beacon of love with an irresistibly magnanimous heart. And Fawcett, whose 
tumbling, Goldilocked curls belie her rough past, nicely segues from peevish 
self-involvement to a woman who learns to change diapers, shovel buffalo chips 
and anticipate the husband's nocturnal visits (in an arrangement designed and 
encouraged by the dying wife). 
</P>
<P>
 The sex, under Peter Werner's measured direction, is realistic and forthright 
as opposed to smirky-glossy or coy. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Substitute Wife" airs at 9 tonight on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39).

BOY BECOMES EAST VALLEY'S 3RD HIT-RUN VICTIM IN 5 DAYS; CRIME: SKYY NELSON, 7, 
DIES AFTER BEING RUN DOWN. NEIGHBORS DESCRIBE STREET AS DANGEROUS, WITH 
SPEEDING A CONSTANT PROBLEM. 
</P>

<P>
 In the third death caused by a hit-and-run driver in the east San Fernando 
Valley in five days, a 7-year-old boy was struck and killed Sunday as he and 
his sister bolted across the street to get to an ice cream truck, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Skyy Nelson was hit by a black 1982 Volkswagen Rabbit as he ran across the 
street behind his 4-year-old sister in the 9000 block of Tobias Avenue at 10:25 
a.m., said Officer Frank Zdroy of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the boy ran into the street from between parked cars. Witnesses 
told police the driver of the car, described as a mustachioed male Latino about 
25 years old, didn't stop despite the loud, dull sound made when the child was 
struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I crossed the street when I heard the thud," said a 40-year-old man who 
witnessed the accident, according to a police report. "The car never slowed or 
stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 A witness said the driver sped north on Tobias, turned right onto Nordhoff and 
disappeared. Witnesses estimated the car was traveling at least 40 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of the crash yanked the victim from his shoes and threw his body 
about 25 feet from where the accident occurred, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy was taken by ambulance to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, 
where he was placed on life-support systems but died at 4:15 p.m., a nursing 
supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheila Renee Jones, 38, the boy's mother, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said they were not surprised by the incident, since drivers 
frequently speed along the street in the low-income neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived here for six or seven months and I've seen at least six accidents 
where no one even bothers to get out of their cars and exchange names," said 
Ronda Anderson, an apartment manager who lives across the street from where the 
boy was hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if you stand here long enough you'll see a car come speeding down the 
street," she said. "And when the cops leave, it's back to business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
 Police from the San Fernando Valley Traffic Division confirmed neighbors' 
complaints that speeding cars and accidents involving uninsured motorists in 
the area are a constant problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Gomez, who manages the Green Village Apartments, where the victim lived 
with his mother, said the boy and his sister moved into the apartment complex 
only the day before. The boy's mother had lived there since April 1, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday night, a 12-year-old girl and her mother were struck and killed 
as they crossed a Pacoima intersection where neighbors for more than two years 
had tried to get city officials to install a traffic light. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Godoy, 48, and her daughter, Amalia, were struck by a car while crossing 
the unmarked intersection at Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Montague Street on 
their way home from a relative's house, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Godoy's son, Marco, 13, was walking with them, but stopped to tie his shoe 
before he stepped into the intersection, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando Bengoechea, 23, of Arleta, reportedly the driver of the car, turned 
himself in to police shortly before midnight on Wednesday, about four hours 
after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they were still searching Sunday night for the driver who struck 
Nelson.

 A San Fernando Valley couple credit the self-defense course they took two 
years ago with enabling them to fight off two bandits who attempted to rob them 
in an alley off Ventura Boulevard Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The man and woman, both 40, were leaving Mimo's Patio Cafe in the 18600 block 
of Ventura Boulevard, where they had dined with two friends after a movie. The 
group was strolling to a parking lot behind a theater when the robbers pounced 
on them, said Officer Sandra Castello of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 As one couple watched from a few feet away, the bandits walked up behind the 
second couple, police said. One held a gun on the man while the second tried to 
steal the woman's purse, said the male victim, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 But the woman, who along with her husband had taken training to deal with such 
encounters, held on tight to her purse and kicked the assailant in the groin 
with her right knee, Castello said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing the scuffle, the armed bandit started pistol-whipping the husband, 
striking him at least five times, Castello said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what was going on until the guy hit me three or four times," 
the male victim said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the couple's friends had retreated about 30 yards behind a parked 
car and used a hand-held portable phone to call the 911 emergency number, 
Castello said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was able to get a hold of the gun hand that was hitting me, I was able 
to defend myself a little bit," the husband said. "It was funny, it was like 
everything was going in slow motion, and the things I was taught almost two 
years ago were coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be calling them on Monday to sign up" for another course, he said. The 
couple took self-defense classes at Model Mugging Inc. in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 The husband was able to keep the gunman's hand away from him and used his free 
hand to strike the assailant. 
</P>
<P>
 The bandits gave up the attack, fled to a waiting car parked along Yolanda 
Avenue and were last seen heading north on that street, Castello said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both victims were taken to Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical Center, where they 
were treated and released early Sunday. The man suffered head lacerations that 
required stitches, authorities said. His wife was unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects are described as two male Latinos in their late teens to mid-20s, 
Castello said. The gunman is described as 5 feet, 8 inches tall, about 25 years 
old with brown hair and weighing about 180 pounds. The second man was described 
as 5 feet, 7 inches tall, about 170 pounds and with black hair, Castello said.

BARBECUE A KOSHER RIB-TICKLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Meat cases in New York, Chicago, Detroit had been picked clean as bone. 
</P>
<P>
 And with a sympathetic shrug, Rabbi Eliezer Eidlitz explained that he had 
cornered the market on kosher ribs. 
</P>
<P>
 One thousand pounds of the ribs -- about the total amount available 
domestically on any given day -- along with equal amounts of kosher chicken and 
kosher hot dogs went up in smoke Sunday at what was billed as the world's 
largest kosher barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anybody in New York wants kosher ribs today, they will be very upset," 
said Eidlitz. 
</P>
<P>
 It was no easy feat to amass the nation's supply of kosher ribs. In fact, near 
impossible for anyone but Eidlitz, the man who wrote the book on kosher foods 
-- titled "What Is Kosher?" -- and advised the Pentagon on supplying kosher 
meals to observant Muslims, Jews and Hindus serving in Operation Desert Storm. 
</P>
<P>
 The barbecue raised funds to expand the Emek Hebrew Academy, the San Fernando 
Valley's largest Orthodox Jewish school. Organizers say the event was part of a 
larger campaign to raise $2.8 million to enlarge the 34-year-old school's 
capacity from 600 students to 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always held fund-raisers at hotels, and it was an OK evening but it 
would involve only the adults and was usually very formal and very stiff," said 
Eidlitz, the school's director of development. "Afterward, people would say, 
'For a banquet, that was OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After Sunday, those days may be long gone. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 people attended the picnic at Calamigos Ranch in the Santa 
Monica Mountains. The afternoon featured pony rides, carnival rides, 
face-painting, baseball, soccer and live music -- and kids everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Formal? Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Yochanan Stepen, the school's educational director, stripped to a 
bathing suit atop a dunk tank and challenged the crowd to pay $10 for a shot at 
dropping him into the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this community, that's practically nude," said David Silver, a parent of 
two children at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Orthodox Jewish community follow stricter Jewish laws. For 
example, males always keep their heads covered and families keep kosher 
households. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys and girls at the school, which has campuses in Sherman Oaks and North 
Hollywood, take classes separately and do not mix during lunch or breaks. They 
wear uniforms and, school officials say, unlike many public schools, the worst 
trouble they face is from students who chew gum or litter. 
</P>
<P>
 Such strict rules, said ninth-grader Asher Perez, "helps keep your mind on 
your studies." Other students agreed, saying there was plenty of time for 
socializing even though their school day is much longer than that of public 
schools, ending as late as 6 p.m. some days. 
</P>
<P>
 So the sight of one of the school's leading scholars sitting in his shorts 
atop a dunk tank drew quite a crowd, especially among youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't hit the side of a barn!" yelled Stepen, as he sat perched atop 
the tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Eli Avihod, an Israeli immigrant and father of two children at Emek Hebrew 
Academy, was the first pitcher accurate enough to make the steel arm drop the 
rabbi into a vat of 42-degree water. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a lot better than a banquet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It took a week to prepare the kosher foods served at the barbecue. Kosher 
butchers from across the country provided the meat. Much of the preparations 
were done at the school beforehand. The ribs, chicken and hot dogs were 
precooked and put into trays that were covered and sealed by a rabbi. 
</P>
<P>
 Eidlitz used a propane torch to kosherize the barbecue grills, as required by 
Jewish dietary laws. And another rabbi watched as the meat was reheated on the 
grills and served. Kosher law dictates how the animal is killed as well as how 
the meat is cleaned and prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 Calamigos Ranch sales director Susan Soja at first was nervous about keeping 
track of the details in hosting a kosher event. But now she'd like to offer the 
service to others. "I hope it opens up a whole new market for us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, there were still a few small details to work out. The pitchers of 
water were for the washing of hands -- a dietary rule followed by Orthodox 
Jews. So the stacks of paper cups had to go. 
</P>
<P>
 The event also marked the announcement of the retirement of Dorothy 
Greenstein, who has taught at the school for 31 years -- teaching hundreds of 
students and the children of students. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the teaching of ethics and laws such as the Ten Commandments -- 
topics long expunged from public schools -- gives students a strong foundation 
for how to conduct themselves in the world. It also preserves the 3,400-year 
Jewish culture and history that forms the basis for much of the daily life of 
Orthodox Jews, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a student misbehaves, you can talk to their conscience," Greenstein 
said. "Without ethics and religion, students are empty, a body without a soul."

 The Encino Velodrome, hidden away between Little League fields and the Los 
Angeles River in the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Center, is an appealing mix of 
high-tech and homespun. 
</P>
<P>
 The cyclists, some of them world-class competitors, race with the latest in 
lightweight and aerodynamic equipment. But the velodrome also retains the feel 
of a small-town baseball club. Velodrome members mow the grass, sweep the track 
and do the general maintenance with a minimum of support from the city. The 
infield is home to gophers, and occasionally a rider will encounter a harmless 
snake wiggling its way up a turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like Pony League 40 years ago in Dubuque," said Jim Ansite, sitting 
in the infield as his son James spun around the course. He likened it to 
"grass-roots baseball played in some cornfield." 
</P>
<P>
 Its ramshackle bleachers and cement track painted with the proclamation "U.S. 
Olympic Trials, 1968" speak of glory days past. But the 250-meter track, banked 
at 29 degrees, has plenty of admirers -- from world-class riders to teens 
learning the sport to fitness fanatics in their 40s and 50s. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to the 350-meter Olympic Velodrome at Cal State Dominguez Hills, the 
Encino track is fast and short. "Racing seems so much more action-packed here," 
said U.S. National Team member Janie Eickoff. Paul Swift, another U.S. National 
Team member, called the track "short and bumpy," but "good to sharpen your 
skills." 
</P>
<P>
 Track insiders will tell you that the Velodrome, one of four in the state, is 
the best-kept secret in the San Fernando Valley sports scene, a steppingstone 
for Olympic hopefuls and a place to showcase national and world-class 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the atmosphere remains small town. Only 20 or 30 fans generally show up 
to watch. And when they shout at officials to dispute calls, they address them 
by first name. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the most part, the crowd is quiet. The dominant sounds are the 
whirring of chains and the whoosh of air streaming through the spokes, 
whispering in the night air.

GROUP HOPES HISTORIC RANCH BECOMES UNIVERSAL CITY'S OTHER TOURIST STOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 If members of a local historical group get their way, Universal City will have 
another major tourist attraction in the restored ranch of Campo de Cahuenga -- 
site of the treaty signing that ended the Mexican-American War and paved the 
way for California to join the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Though overshadowed by the Universal Studios complex across the street, the 
site at 3919 Lankershim Blvd. was host to about 100 visitors Sunday who viewed 
a re-enactment of the treaty signing of Jan. 13, 1847. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't know about this place," said Guy Weddington McCreary, president 
of the Campo de Cahuenga Memorial Assn. "We want to put it on the map." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the turnout for the event disappointed the sponsors, some visitors 
traveled from as far as Orange County to celebrate the histories of Mexico and 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids are learning about California history in school and we brought them 
here to reinforce what they've been learning," said Cathy and Steve Freeman of 
Anaheim, who brought their two children and three nieces and nephews. 
</P>
<P>
 The men who negotiated the treaty, U.S. Army Officer John C. Fremont and Gen. 
Andres Pico, the last Mexican governor of California -- then a province of 
Mexico -- were portrayed by actors wearing period costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1847, Pico, in keeping with the Mexican tradition of celebrating after 
important events, held a fiesta. On Sunday, the Russek Spanish Fiesta Dancers 
performed Spanish and Mexican dances after the re-enactment to kick off the 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd was treated to refreshments and a tour of the house, which was 
restored in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 A water fountain on the house lawn features a plaque honoring Donna Bernarda 
Ruiz, the bilingual interpreter who helped the Mexican and American generals 
write the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the association has held indoor celebrations each January for the past 
44 years, McCreary said Sunday's festivities marked the beginning of spring and 
fall celebrations, complete with the re-enactment. 
</P>
<P>
 The association is soliciting funding from MCA Inc., a member of its board, to 
help update the exhibition hall, provide parking for the site and help turn it 
into a major tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be a great struggle, but one that is way overdue," McCreary 
said.

WOMAN KILLED BY EXPLOSIVE IS IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 33-year-old woman killed by an unknown explosive device while she scavenged 
a desert roadside for cans with her two young sons was identified Sunday as 
Lynn Standish of Pearblossom. 
</P>
<P>
 One of her sons, 4-year-old Michael Standish, who was injured in the blast, 
remained in serious but stable condition at Antelope Valley Medical Center in 
Lancaster, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Britta Tubbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Standishes were walking along a dirt road off Pearblossom Highway Friday 
afternoon when an explosive device detonated, killing the woman and injuring 
the boy. A 9-year-old son was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The two boys were able to walk back to the highway, where they flagged down a 
passing motorist for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Tubbs said sheriff's arson and explosives experts were still investigating to 
determine whether the explosion was accidental or intentional.

DISTRICT CONSIDERS MEDI-CAL TO ATTRACT FUNDS; EDUCATION: IF APPROVED, THE STATE 
PROGRAM WOULD COMPENSATE HART SCHOOLS FOR SOME COSTS OF THE HEALTH CARE THEY 
ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When local students go to the nurse's office next year, school officials hope 
the federal government will mend some of the financial pain schools feel as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 The William S. Hart Union High School District is considering a school-based 
Medi-Cal program to generate new money for the district. The program would 
compensate the schools for some costs for the physical and mental health care 
required by law. 
</P>
<P>
 Many details remain to be worked out, but the district hopes to begin the 
program by the fall, said William Maddigan, director of the district's business 
and fiscal services. He said the district would be required to keep more 
extensive student medical records, which could be critical in an emergency, but 
medical services provided by the school initially would not change. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is facing at least a $2-million deficit for the 1994-95 school 
year. Maddigan said he does not know how much money the Medi-Cal program would 
generate, but it would not make a substantial impact on the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, it didn't seem like it would be worth the work to set up a big 
bureaucracy for what seems like a relatively small amount of money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city, community organizations and the Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial 
Hospital have expressed support for the proposal, which could simplify planning 
and lead to a better system of health care for youth, Maddigan said. In 
addition, schools would spend less money on existing health services, 
eventually allowing new services that would not otherwise exist. 
</P>
<P>
 "My own conclusion is there'd be . . . a little expansion and a little 
substitution (for current funding)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Medi-Cal is the state agency for the federal Medicaid program, providing 
health care funds for low-income families. Legislation passed by the state in 
1992 and modified this year allows school districts to become Medi-Cal 
providers, receiving a refund of money spent treating eligible students. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimate 10 to 15 states have passed legislation enabling schools to 
become Medicaid providers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hart district would become one of the first in the nation to implement the 
program, although school districts in Los Angeles and Fresno are also 
considering it. Judy Beck, nurse supervisor of the San Diego Unified School 
District, said a pilot program begun in that district at the beginning of the 
1993-94 school year is living up to its promise. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the next fiscal year, I think maybe we will be bringing in some money 
with which we can enhance services," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of this year's reimbursements have gone to pay for the computer system 
that tracks students' records and for other operating costs, Beck said. Medical 
services offered by the school district have not changed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart district officials said the cost to design the program is estimated at $1 
a student -- or about $11,000. The costs of equipment and administration of the 
program are expected to be covered by Medi-Cal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of reimbursement varies widely, said Craig Cook, a consultant for 
school-based Medicaid programs. He said a school employee in California who 
provides health care to students and earns $50,000 a year could generate $2,500 
a year in federal reimbursements if 20% of the students at the school are 
eligible for Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's for what they are already doing and all they have to do is fill out a 
time-study form three or four times a quarter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eligible employees are not limited to school nurses, Cook said. Others can 
include psychological counselors, speech and physical therapists, or even a 
teacher who arranges for a child to see a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddigan said he estimates 10% to 20% of the students in the Hart district may 
be eligible for Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart trustees appear supportive of the plan, although a final proposal is far 
from complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if we didn't get one cent back, I think we ought to do it," said Bill 
Dinsenbacher, one of the board's five members. "There are many potential 
benefits, but the greatest benefit is healthier pupils."

DUNLEAVY EATS RIGHT, HAS ROBINSON IN SIGHT; PRO BASKETBALL: TRIP TO DELI IS 
LUCKY FOR MILWAUKEE COACH, WHO WINS LOTTERY FOR NO. 1 NBA DRAFT PICK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Eleven team representatives came from around the country Sunday for the NBA's 
10th annual draft lottery, good luck charms in tow. 
</P>
<P>
 All they got for lugging those bags of mementos were increased odds for a 
hernia, because the answer was here all along, a few minutes away in New York 
City and too big to carry, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee Coach Mike Dunleavy knew. That's why he went to the Stage Deli in 
Manhattan for brunch, because he heard General Manager Pat Williams went there 
the previous two years and the Orlando Magic got the No. 1 selection both 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, there are two good bets. Dunleavy and the Milwaukee Bucks will take 
Glenn Robinson of Purdue with the top pick in the June 29 draft after winning 
the lottery held at NBA Entertainment headquarters. And, the Stage Deli will be 
packed on a Sunday morning next May. 
</P>
<P>
 The new heavily weighted lottery system, brought on after Orlando was No. 1 in 
1993 despite barely missing the playoffs, worked. Every bad team stayed where 
it finished in the standings, meaning the Clippers landed No. 7 and the Lakers 
No. 10, and the dreadful teams will get the top four picks. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked best for the Bucks, who were 20-62 last season and are desperate to 
get bigger. Dunleavy ordered a pastrami-and-cheese and Robinson, then got it 
all to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a helpless feeling being up there (on stage)," said Dunleavy, 
who raised his fists to punctuate the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Drafting Robinson would probably mean keeping Vin Baker out of position at 
center, but Dunleavy was quick to remind that the versatility of both means 
they could fit together and Baker said Robinson gets his vote, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can definitely play together," said Baker, who represented the Bucks at 
the actual lottery before the envelopes were opened on stage on live 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bucks were the only team to move up from their finish in the standings, 
and that was from fourth to first. They had a 16.3% chance of getting the top 
pick, which the standings would have given to Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks will pick second. 
</P>
<P>
 After No. 1 and Robinson, it becomes a guessing game. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it comes time for our pick, we'll take the best available player, but we 
believe that we'll be able to get a quality player picking at No. 7," Clipper 
General Manager Elgin Baylor said. "After the first two or three players are 
selected, I think the pool of talent available is wide open." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Laker General Manager Jerry West, who watched the proceedings from the 
Forum: "There was some excitement (in previous years) when a team late in the 
draft could win and move up. . . . Now, there's none. Maybe they can just take 
the four worst teams and let everyone else save the time and effort of going to 
New York and taking all that extra luggage with all their lucky charms." 
</P>
<P>
 They can leave it behind anyway. Everything they need will be waiting in 
Manhattan.

MIKE DOWNEY: SING NO SAD SONGS FOR HER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 A boy once approached Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart for advice on how to compose a 
symphony. Mozart told the child to stick to ballads instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you wrote symphonies when you were my age!" protested the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mozart: "Yes. But I didn't have to ask how." 
</P>
<P>
 And so two centuries later we come to poor, poor Jennifer Capriati. Tennis 
ace. Child prodigy. 
</P>
<P>
 Magazine cover girl at 13. Millionairess at 14. Olympic champion at 15. Petty 
thief at 17. In drug rehab at 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, boo, hoo, hoo. Oh, tennis gave her "too much, too soon." Oh, tennis rushed 
her into the world "before she was ready." Oh, professional tennis "eats its 
young." Oh, woe is Jennifer. 
</P>
<P>
 Boy, we can make up excuses for anybody, can't we? 
</P>
<P>
 We excuse juvenile delinquents because they're underprivileged. Then we 
forgive juvenile delinquents because they're over privileged. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess it's only the middle-class kids who have nobody to blame but 
themselves. Shame on you middle-class out there. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Capriati is a punk. Women want equal rights, let's give them equal 
rights. An 18-year-old man who pulled what she pulled would be called a punk. 
Let's call her what she is. 
</P>
<P>
 Misguided? Yeah, sure. We should all be so misguided. 
</P>
<P>
 Listen to Carling Bassett Seguso, who knows whereof she speaks. Carling was a 
pro tennis phenom, a rich kid. Of Capriati she says, "It kind of appalls me 
when people say her childhood was taken away. I mean, the girl played one 
tournament a month, she went to school full-time, she had a financial situation 
where she could travel with her friends and her family. . . . They gave her a 
lot of freedom . . . and she just went a little bit nuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, she did. But you would never know it from reading all the drivel we've 
been reading lately. Oh, tennis starts them out too young! Oh, no child should 
be put in this terrible situation! 
</P>
<P>
 Grow up. 
</P>
<P>
 Child prodigies have been coming and going for 2,000 years. No, come to think 
of it, longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of them turn out just fine. Not all of them get busted with a crackhead 
in a Florida motel, or shoplift jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Temple had pressures galore as a kid. She turned out so awful, she 
became a U.S. diplomat. Ron Howard had heavy responsibilities as a child. He 
turned out so awful, he became a Hollywood director of films to which you can 
take your family. 
</P>
<P>
 But oh, poor Jennifer never had a "normal childhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Ford was a high school dropout. So were George Gershwin, Jack London, 
Frank Sinatra, Will Rogers, Mary Baker Eddy, Amedeo Modigliani, Marshal Tito, 
Al Pacino, Cher. I don't recommend it, but it didn't exactly ruin them for 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 I once asked Andre Agassi what part of childhood he missed out on because of 
tennis. His answer was: "The prom." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing pro tennis as a child "wrecked" Andre's life so much that he owns 
private airplanes, hangs out with Barbra Streisand and Brooke Shields and wears 
religious medallions. Yeah, Andre is such a spoiled-rotten kid that when I flew 
to Las Vegas to meet him, he picked me up at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 People achieve at an early age. Ballerinas, pianists, these kids don't start 
out at age 16. They can't. Some can play a concerto at 4. Gymnasts can't wait 
to be of voting age. They begin as children, and most of them, Mary Lou Retton, 
Bart Conner, Shannon Miller, turn out fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Figure skaters turn out fine. Peggy Fleming, Dorothy Hamill, Kristi Yamaguchi, 
their heads are still on straight. They were princesses who were pampered and 
pressured, same as Capriati. Once they became queens, they remained pretty 
darned regal. Merely because Tonya Harding took wrong turns doesn't mean Oksana 
Baiul will. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Evert is a responsible adult. Who started younger? You think Joe 
DiMaggio had pressure being a public figure? Evert was recognized worldwide. 
The woman couldn't walk through Bulgaria unrecognized. Surprisingly, she never 
robbed any stores. She became a champion, businesswoman and mother. Poor, 
maladjusted Chrissie. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Austin turned out OK, too. Austin won the U.S. Open at 16. She later 
wrote: "But I am haunted by the thought that I had to leave the game so young. 
The last time I played Wimbledon, I was 19. To see all the talent God gave me 
go unused troubles me." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the last time I bumped into Tracy, I went away thinking: Now there goes 
one pleasant, mature person. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis didn't fail Jennifer Capriati. Society didn't fail Jennifer Capriati. 
Child labor laws didn't fail Jennifer Capriati. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati failed Capriati. 
</P>
<P>
 She is an adult, not a child. Some kids with bad backgrounds turn out good, 
some kids with good backgrounds turn out bad. 
</P>
<P>
 I went to a U.S. Open once where Capriati announced her new association as 
spokeswoman -- sorry, spokesgirl -- for Oil of Olay skin cream. She was 14. 
Let's assume it didn't make her thin-skinned. This is no girl now. She's a 
grown woman. She has had breaks others would kill to have, breaks others have 
killed to have. Save your pity. 
</P>
<P>
 Some kids have natural talent and need to let it out. At 2, supposedly, baby 
Mozart heard a pig squeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "G-sharp," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Were he around today, somebody would tell Mozart to lay off the pro song 
writing tour until he was, oh, 22 and had his bachelor's degree.

WORLD CUP '94 / 25 DAYS AND COUNTING; A SOCCER ROCKER; LALAS PLAYS TO OWN BEAT; 
U.S. DEFENDER IS A HIT WITH FANS BUT HITS SOUR NOTE WITH GAME'S PURISTS

<P>
 Pete Townshend had his generation, Alexi Lalas has his, which partially 
explains: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The wild red mane and straggly goatee that give Lalas the appearance of a 
grunge beast who took a wrong turn at Aberdeen and wound up on a soccer field; 
</P>
<P>
 -- The self-produced, self-distributed Alexi Lalas rock CD, featuring the 
sing-along favorite "Kickin' Balls;" 
</P>
<P>
 -- The self-styled Alexi Lalas logo, which is tattooed on his right ankle and 
is a registered trademark in the United States; 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Upper Deck World Cup edition trading card, picturing Lalas in very cool 
black shades, acoustic guitar strapped to his shoulder; 
</P>
<P>
 -- And the consuming lifelong dream that continues to drive Lalas as he 
approaches his 24th year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can die a happy man," Lalas says, "if someone offers me an endorsement for 
7-Eleven Slurpees." 
</P>
<P>
 A look of absolute bliss spreads across Lalas' face. Ah, the whirled cup. 
Lalas gazes skyward as he contemplates the frothy crushed ice and treacly 
cherry syrup, beckoning him as they do every day between practice sessions with 
the U.S. national team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live and breathe 'em," Lalas says. "I grew up on them. To be able to 
endorse them -- that would be beautiful, man, because I love 'em and I want to 
spread the gospel of Slurpees." 
</P>
<P>
 If this sounds in any way similar to Winona Ryder's ode to the Big Gulp in the 
movie "Reality Bites," congratulations, you have wandered into the right 
demographic. Born in 1970 and arriving at the world's stage in 1994, Alexi 
Lalas is an American sports hero for his times, where doing it yourself is the 
only reliable means to success, and peace, love and understanding can be found 
at the bottom of a wax-coated paper cup. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also ahead of his time -- an American-born-and-raised soccer player with 
his own cult following, complete with post-match choruses of squealing teen-age 
girls and appearances on CNN, ESPN and the cover of Sports Illustrated For 
Kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bar none, he is the most interviewed man in America, I don't care what 
anybody says," jibes U.S. goalkeeper Tony Meola, who goes back to the days when 
the prescribed behavior for the typical American soccer player was to be unseen 
and not heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Back to the days of January, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Lalas is rewriting the rules, one autograph at a time. He is reeling off a few 
dozen more after a luncheon at the Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles when a man 
sidles up next to him and says, "I thought you were going to sing a song for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Franz Beckenbauer used to get the same thing all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, they didn't invite me to, man," says Lalas, who left his six guitars at 
home. "They're scared. They're scared I'm going to embarrass them or something. 
Oh well." 
</P>
<P>
 "I like your record," the man says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lalas stops signing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you?" he asks eagerly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 "All right!" Lalas replies, nodding intensely. "There's the man, there's the 
man. That's one more. 
</P>
<P>
 "What comes after tin?" Lalas muses. "Nickel? The album has just gone nickel." 
</P>
<P>
 Later the same day, Lalas is cruising the Santa Ana Freeway, heading to his 
San Juan Capistrano apartment, when a car pulls up alongside him. The man 
behind the wheel is holding up a soccer magazine and waving it to get Lalas' 
attention -- a drive-by salute from the fast lane. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't want to talk or anything, he just wanted to say hello," Lalas says. 
"He was obviously a soccer fan. He recognized me and he just wanted to be 
acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was very cool." 
</P>
<P>
 When he arrives at his apartment, Lalas finds a long, thin UPS package waiting 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "All right," Lalas yelps as he drags the box onto the living room floor and 
begins tearing at one end. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, he is pulling out a stack of wall posters. They are huge full-color 
likenesses of Lalas, each bearing an inscription in 1960s-era psychedelic 
typeface: "The Alexi Lalas Experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Just a gift from the guitar company that recently signed Lalas to an 
endorsement contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "This," Lalas says, "is very cool." 
</P>
<P>
 The Alexi Lalas Experience? At the moment, Lalas isn't looking to trade. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Christmas, 1992, was not very cool. Lalas spent it alone, holed up in a drab 
London hotel room, holding out hope that his month-long tryout with the 
renowned English club, Arsenal, might produce something tangible, like a 
paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd just finished with the Olympics," Lalas says, "and I had nothing else 
going. Nobody wanted me or anything like that. I was just hanging out back home 
in Detroit for a little bit when, luckily, somebody offered me an opportunity 
to go over and try out for Arsenal in London, which is arguably one of the 
greatest teams in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had nothing, no guarantee. Somebody offered this tryout -- that was it. So 
I packed my bag and spent all of December trying out for this team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here I am, a guy with no experience, no name, trying out for one of the 
world's best teams. And in England, defenders are a dime a dozen. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't want me at the end of it. That's OK. Whatever. But, man, I spent 
a month in a hotel, just sort of sitting there, going, 'Oh my God. My life's 
over. I don't know what's going to happen. I don't have a job. No one's going 
to take me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Salvation came in the form of Bora Milutinovic, the man entrusted with one of 
the most formidable sporting tasks of our time -- assembling a U.S. soccer team 
capable of playing host to a World Cup tournament without spilling drinks on 
the carpet. In early 1993, Milutinovic put out the call, inviting more than 60 
players down to Mission Viejo for auditions. 
</P>
<P>
 For Lalas, it was the beginning of a beautiful relationship. Lalas is not 
especially fast or graceful -- he's a headbanger, and the 18-yard box is his 
personal mosh pit -- but Milutinovic has kept him around for 16 months, through 
wave after wave of cuts, confounding the purists and the elitists who cringe 
and sadly shake their heads as they watch Lalas lope downfield.  
</P>
<P>
 Asked what he likes about Lalas' soccer, Milutinovic jokes, "I don't like 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 He smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has personality ," Milutinovic says. "He is a young man full of the life. 
He likes music, he likes soccer, he is very intelligent. He learns very fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is personality? If you love what you do in life, if you are not afraid 
of nothing, this is good personality. Alexi has this personality." 
</P>
<P>
 Lalas, U.S. Olympian and 1991 college player of the year at Rutgers, is both 
bemused and bewildered at the abuse he receives in the world soccer press. The 
prevailing view is that Lalas is too slow and too often out of position -- 
criticism he was hearing again Saturday night after the United States' 3-2 loss 
to German champion Bayern Munich. 
</P>
<P>
 "I answer a lot of questions about my lack of skills," Lalas says with a sigh. 
"Bora 'inexplicably backs' me. I've heard that a couple times. I don't know 
what to make of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you say that, it means it's inexplicable in a sense that there should be 
some explanation as to why someone with less skills or experience should be 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I've worked my . . . off and I've had some success, man. Don't take that 
away from me." 
</P>
<P>
 Another sling shot in Lalas' direction: His rough-and-tumble game is too 
physical for World Cup play; he's a red card waiting to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Lalas slams the soft drink he is holding down on the table top. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is such of load of. . . ," he bellows. "You've got to be physical. I 
think for what my role is on the team, I do pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 Lalas' role, as he sees it, is not unlike Marty McSorley's in hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 He is to serve as enforcer for the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Damn right," Lalas says. "I know my role. My role is to win all the head 
balls. It's to tackle. It's to defuse dangerous offensive situations. It's to 
read the game. It's to lead. And it's to intimidate. I'm out there to protect 
my players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I do these to the best of my abilities. If in some people's opinion, 
it's not enough, screw 'em. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least they're thinking about it, that's all I can say." 
</P>
<P>
 He laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if it is a blatantly uninformed and unbelievably naive opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alexi Lalas doesn't want you to know this, but he attended Cranbrook Kingswood 
High in Birmingham, Mich., a private school in an upscale suburb of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't say that too loud," Lalas deadpans. "Nobody knows that around here. 
They all think I grew up in a trash can or something like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they saw where I went to school, it would ruin my reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 At Cranbrook, Lalas learned his chops, both as a soccer player and a musician. 
He also played hockey well enough to captain Cranbrook to the state 
championship in 1987. He played both sports in college, leading Rutgers in 
scoring in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 At Rutgers, Lalas formed a band, the Gypsies, and devoted much of his college 
years to "gigging all over the place and having a great time." He majored in 
English, but ask Lalas today to name a favorite author and he'll concede, "I 
don't really have a whole lot. Since I've been out, I've been concentrating on 
going back and reading all the books I blew off in school." 
</P>
<P>
 The band was the thing. Eventually, the Gypsies grew big enough to pack small 
clubs and pubs across New Jersey, but Lalas wanted to put a record out and, 
much to his dismay, there was no Bora Milutinovic at Sire or Elektra. 
</P>
<P>
 So Lalas decided to put one out himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've made some money with this team," Lalas says. "What else am I gonna spend 
it on? I spend it on musical instruments and Slurpees and feeding myself. I 
don't have a lot of extravagant stuff to spend it on. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided I was going to produce it, mix it myself and put it out totally 
independently. Finance it, do everything. I got my 1-800 number and a P.O. box. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Hey, whatever happens, happens.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The result is "Woodland," a 12-song CD that features the Gypsies on half the 
tracks and Lalas, alone with his acoustic guitar, on the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Lalas describes the record as "classic rock, having-a-good-time music, the 
kind of music I grew up with." Bob Seger, J. Geils, John Cougar Mellencamp, the 
'70s band Sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely not a grunge sort of scene or anything like that," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the lyrics convey a heavy world-weariness, a longing to go back home, 
because, as Lalas puts it, "I haven't been able to do it. I do have a longing 
to ease up and relax and go home. My life has been on the road, constantly." 
</P>
<P>
 Lalas originally spent about $1,600 to press 1,000 CDs and says a second 
pressing is planned for June. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely not a major record release," he says, "but, you know, I'm 
selling those. They're selling. I gotta do another pressing, so that's 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 Reviews have generally been kind, even from Milutinovic, who was raised on 
Yugoslavfolk music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is nice," Milutinovic says. "Is young. Is different. I appreciate his talent. 
But myself, I am more Frank Sinatra." 
</P>
<P>
 And Lalas? 
</P>
<P>
 What is he? 
</P>
<P>
 Rocker first and soccer player second? Or the other way around? 
</P>
<P>
 "You mean today? The middle of May?" Lalas says. "Today, it's soccer. It will 
be that way through July 17, and then who knows what happens after that? 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone said, 'Hey, let's jump in the bus and go around and tour and play 
music,' I would definitely consider that. I don't have a big concept of the 
future or what it holds." 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, Lalas' future is June 18, USA vs. Switzerland at the Pontiac 
Silverdome. The U.S. team's World Cup opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Lalas can't wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are going to be 80,000 people, rooting for the USA," he says. "That's 
going to be an unbelievable sort of adrenaline rush." 
</P>
<P>
 Lalas strokes his flaming red goatee. 
</P>
<P>
 "USA adrenaline is something that is very cool." World Cup Player at a Glance

 Little-known fact: The Lalas "family crest" that appears on the "Woodland" 
album cover -- and Lalas' right ankle -- isn't really a family crest. "I tell 
people that, but we don't have a family crest," Lalas says. "When I found that 
out, as a kid, I was so disappointed I decided to make up my own. I used to 
draw it on clothes, books, everything." In college, Lalas had the insignia -- a 
capital A adorned with a diamond and an heart -- tattooed on his ankle and, 
with the release of his record, a fifth-grade doodle now carries a U.S. 
trademark.

TENNIS / FRENCH OPEN; BECKER: SAMPRAS AHEAD OF FIELD, CALENDAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Boris Becker, for one, is impressed by how Pete Sampras is handling clay this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 This, from the man Sampras routed, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2, in the Italian Open final on 
the slow surface last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is playing like they will play the game in the 21st Century," Becker said. 
"He's doing things I've never seen on the tennis court." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras, 22, has the chance to do something no one has done in 25 years -- win 
four consecutive Grand Slam tennis tournaments -- when the French Open begins 
today at Roland Garros Stadium in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's favorite, Steffi Graf, is trying for her fifth consecutive Grand 
Slam event title, and anyone remotely connected to the game believes she will 
get it. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next two weeks, we will see if the world's top-ranked male and 
female can continue their remarkable streaks in the one tournament where 
seedings mean less than clay-court ability. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras might be No. 1, but he must share the favorite's role with No. 4 
Andrei Medvedev of Russia, No. 6 Sergi Bruguera of Spain and No. 7 Jim Courier, 
a two-time winner in Paris. Only one can reach the final because they are all 
seeded in the top-half of the draw. Also in the difficult mix are No. 11 Thomas 
Muster of Austria, No. 16 Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands and No. 19 Andre 
Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The winner) is going to be someone who is aggressive and net-oriented," said 
No. 9 Todd Martin, whose biggest break was drawing the lower bracket. 
</P>
<P>
 Since returning from knee surgery, Medvedev seems to have found a way to win. 
He has been exceptional in major clay-court tournaments, winning at Monte Carlo 
and Hamburg, Germany, and reaching the final in Estoril, Portugal. Medvedev, 
19, gained fame two years ago by reaching the fourth round in Paris, and 
advanced to the semifinals last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Roland Garros' red clay is not suited to Sampras' serve-and-volley 
game, opponents are finding him increasingly difficult on the slow surface. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thinks he's invincible now," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras didn't start the year that way. In January at Doha, Qatar, he lost in 
the first round to No. 205-ranked Karim Alami of Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he has lost only twice and added the Australian Open to his titles 
at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open last summer. Although a victory in Paris will 
not be an official Grand Slam because the four tournaments must be won in the 
same calendar year, it is significant in that only two men -- Don Budge in 1938 
and Rod Laver in 1962 and '69 -- have won four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras could be the first to do it on three surfaces: grass (Wimbledon), hard 
courts (U.S. and Australian Opens) and clay. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sampras won in Rome last week, it was his first clay tournament in 11 
months. He has won only two of his 27 titles on clay, and that has not given 
him much confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I walk out on clay, I feel a bit vulnerable," he said earlier this 
month. "I wish I didn't feel that way, but that's the way I feel." 
</P>
<P>
 That does little to foster confidence, yet he insists: "I don't think it's 
self-defeating. It's reality." 
</P>
<P>
 This also is reality: Sampras had won seven tournament titles and 29 
consecutive matches until Saturday, when he lost to Michael Stich, 3-6, 7-6 
(9-7), 6-2, at the World Cup in Dusseldorf, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying not to be too consumed with everything," Sampras said last week in 
Rome. "I'm trying to stay relaxed and play my tennis, and not talk too much and 
worry about (the streak)." 
</P>
<P>
 Graf, who never seems to worry much, is seeking her second Grand Slam. Her 
first came in 1988. Maureen Connolly (1953) and Margaret Court (1970) are the 
other women who have done it. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf is expected to win her third French Open title and 16th Grand Slam 
tournament crown overall. She is 37-1 this year, her only loss coming in the 
Hamburg final last month to No. 2 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's game is suffering from the absence of Monica Seles, still 
sidelined a year after being stabbed; and Jennifer Capriati, who left the tour 
last August and was arrested in Florida last week for marijuana possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the return of Martina Navratilova to the French Open for the first 
time since 1988 might help. She is making a farewell appearance here, and that 
alone makes it an historical event.

KINGS TALK WITH MCMASTER, MCCAMMON ABOUT GM JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sam McMaster, who has extensive managerial experience in junior hockey, has 
been interviewed by the Kings for their vacant general manager's job. 
</P>
<P>
 Club executives have also spoken to Bob McCammon, former GM of the Vancouver 
Canucks and Philadelphia Flyers. Larry Pleau, the New York Rangers' assistant 
general manager/player development, has been recommended to the Kings by Ranger 
GM Neil Smith but has not been interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 McMaster, 50, said Sunday he was interviewed in Los Angeles last week. He said 
he talked to new co-owner Joe Cohen, minority owner Bruce McNall and Rogie 
Vachon, assistant to the chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said they'd let me know this coming week, and I'm kind of waiting to 
hear," McMaster said. 
</P>
<P>
 McMaster was Sudbury's GM for six years before leaving to pursue NHL jobs. 
Before that, he scouted for the Washington Capitals from 1985-88. He has been 
GM of the Sault Ste Marie Greyhounds, the Toronto Marlboros and Niagara Falls 
Flyers. Players he has sent to the NHL include Wayne Gretzky, who played in 
Sault Ste Marie; Steve Larmer; Greg Gilbert; John Vanbiesbrouck; Rick Tocchet; 
Ron Duguay and Bob Probert. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, in 13 years, my winning percentage is .600. I'm proud of that," 
McMaster said. "I'm a career manager. I don't want to be a coach. I look after 
the management end of things -- the players and the finances." 
</P>
<P>
 Pleau, 45, said he has not been contacted by the Kings. A Ranger official said 
Smith would give the Kings permission to interview Pleau. 
</P>
<P>
 A former NHL player and coach, Pleau said he would be interested should the 
Kings call. "It's just that it's a hard time right now. When you're in the 
playoffs, your mind isn't on another job," said Pleau, who runs the Rangers' 
scouting operations and negotiates contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 McCammon, according to a source, was interviewed by Cohen, Vachon and McNall 
and also felt the interview was promising.

INDIANAPOLIS 500; RIBBS CAN'T BURST BUBBLE OF FOYT, HERTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A.J. Foyt, who knew how to gamble and win as a driver at Indianapolis Motor 
Speedway, took a big gamble Sunday as a car owner and won. 
</P>
<P>
 Foyt's driver, rookie Bryan Herta of Los Angeles, was on the bubble as the 
slowest qualifier among the 33 cars for next Sunday's Indianapolis 500 when the 
clock neared closing time of 6 p.m. If another car bumped him, there wasn't 
enough time to get back in line for another attempt. If Foyt chose to withdraw 
the car, Herta would have to run faster than 221 m.p.h. in his backup car  
</P>
<P>
 "I rolled the dice," Foyt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-time winner turned car owner elected to sit on Herta's time and dared 
Willy T. Ribbs -- the only driver with time remaining to make a qualifying 
attempt -- to beat Herta's speed of 220.992 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew Willy had not been in that car, and I knew he'd been having trouble 
all month getting speed up, so we just kind of gambled," Foyt said. "I knew 
that No. 9 car had been running awful fast, but I knew it wasn't Willy 
driving." 
</P>
<P>
 Ribbs, who had failed to qualify in his own car last Sunday, climbed into 
teammate Robby Gordon's backup Lola-Ford Cosworth, but could get it up to only 
216 m.p.h. Gordon had practiced at 222.916 earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a long shot, but I was unfamiliar with the car," Ribbs said. "We had 
everything to gain and nothing to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Bright sunshine and 89-degree temperatures, the worst enemy of horsepower, 
allowed only one driver, rookie Marco Greco of Brazil, to break into the field 
on the final day of time trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Greco became the sixth of Dick Simon's stable of drivers to qualify. Earlier, 
Simon put Raul Boesel, Lyn St. James, Hiro Matsushita and rookies Dennis Vitolo 
and Hideshi Matsuda in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Greco's 221.216 m.p.h. bumped Scott Goodyear. 
</P>
<P>
 After no one tried to qualify from a noon track opening until 5:30 p.m., Greco 
took a chance. When he finished his four laps, Goodyear was out and Herta on 
the bubble, sitting in line in case he needed to drive the No. 41 backup car. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, Geoff Brabham, Mark Smith and Gary Bettenhausen failed. Brabham 
started off with a 221 m.p.h. lap, but steadily got slower. Smith brushed the 
wall in the first turn of his first lap and slid backward through the short 
chute. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettenhausen, a hometown favorite who grew up in nearby Monrovia, brought a 
moan from the huge crowd when he could squeeze only 218 out of his year-old 
Penske-Ilmor. 
</P>
<P>
 As the crew's yellow flag waved off Bettenhausen after two laps, Foyt told 
chief steward Tom Binford that he was pushing Herta's car out of the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the commotion going on out there, you'd have thought we were on the 
pole," Herta said. "I guess I'd rather be the slowest qualifier than the 
fastest non-qualifier. I never really wish anything bad on anyone, but while 
Willy T. was making his run I hoped he wouldn't go over 200." 
</P>
<P>
 Didier Theys was in line as the gun sounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bryan was cool. I can't say enough about how he handled as rough a situation 
as you can find here," Foyt said. The Lineup 03,25,23,05 Driver

CONE SHOWS HE'S NO ROYAL PAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Cone continued to reinvent himself Sunday afternoon at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Strikeouts and turmoil defined Cone's six-year tenure with the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-year, $18-million contract that included a record $9-million signing 
bonus haunted him in his first season in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cone said Sunday he's buried his past and become a new pitcher, relying 
more on finesse and control instead of raw power. He's embraced change this 
season and says he's better off. Just look at the results. 
</P>
<P>
 Cone (8-1) pitched a one-hit shutout Sunday, defeating the Angels, 4-0, and 
extending two noteworthy streaks to career highs. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he won his eighth consecutive game and lowered his earned-run average 
to 2.47. Second, he extended his streak of scoreless innings to 28 consecutive. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was unhittable today," Kansas City Manager Hal McRae said. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, almost. Chili Davis had the Angels' only hit, muscling a 1-and-2 
fastball into left field for a single in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "He fought it off," Cone later said. "It was a good pitch. (But) there was no 
way I was thinking no-hitter. It was the furthest thing from my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody asked Cone if he felt dominant against an Angel team that was batting 
.282 and had won three consecutive games against the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't use the word dominant," said Cone, who threw his third career 
one-hitter. "I'd say aggressive. I don't know how many times I was ahead in the 
count, but I'd venture it was a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 He's a pitcher now rather than just another hard thrower, picking his spots 
and using his head and his arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he was pressing last year," McRae said. "It's only natural. He was 
trying to justify his salary. Now, he's not trying to justify his salary. He's 
just competing." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing seemed to trouble Cone Sunday. Not money, pressure or Angel batters. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from Davis' opposite-field single, only Gary DiSarcina and Dwight Smith 
hit Cone hard. DiSarcina lined out to right in the third and Smith drove center 
fielder Brian McRae to the warning track with a line drive in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything else was a weakly hit grounder or pop fly. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a much better pitcher," McRae said. "He's on top of the hitters the last 
three games. And the guys he doesn't strike out don't get good swings. He's in 
total control." 
</P>
<P>
 Run support has played a key part in Cone's success. Last season, the Royals 
averaged three runs in his starts. This season, they average more than five 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 4-0 after the top of the sixth against the Angels and Cone settled into 
a comfortable groove. But that didn't mean he was satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year taught him failure can overrun success in a flash. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a humbling year," he said. "This year, there's nothing I take for 
granted. You have to constantly prove yourself. (Others might say) 'He's got 
off to a great start, but can he keep it going?' 
</P>
<P>
 "You can never be satisfied."

LUKAS CELEBRATES -- FOR A MINUTE; HORSE RACING: WORKAHOLIC TRAINER WILL SEEK 
FIRST BELMONT VICTORY WITH TABASCO CAT AFTER COLT WINS THE PREAKNESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wayne Lukas went out to celebrate Saturday night after his Tabasco Cat won the 
Preakness -- all the way to a park bench 10 yards from the barn, where the 
trainer and a groom dined on fried chicken, french fries and chocolate 
milkshakes that Lukas had brought back to Pimlico from a nearby fast-food 
outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 A workaholic, Lukas, 58, has little in his life besides his family and racing. 
His wife, Shari, brings rented movies home, but her husband seldom watches 
without falling asleep. At home one day, Lukas said to Shari: "I'm going to 
take a nap. Will you wake me up in seven minutes?" 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning after his third Preakness victory, a woman gave Lukas a small 
bottle of bourbon. Lukas accepted graciously, but after the woman left, he held 
the bottle as though it were a hand grenade. Finally, he set it down on the 
wooden railing at the front of the shedrow. "If I drank all the bourbon that's 
in there," he said, "that'd be more bourbon than I've had my whole life." 
</P>
<P>
 If Tabasco Cat wins the Belmont Stakes in three weeks, that would also be more 
Belmonts than Lukas has won. Despite a Kentucky Derby victory with Winning 
Colors and previous Preakness victories with Codex and Tank's Prospect, Lukas 
is winless in seven Belmonts, his best finish is a fourth by Corporate Report 
in 1992. Winning Colors ran last in the 1988 Belmont; Codex was seventh in 1980 
and, in 1985, Tank's Prospect went lame in the race and was pulled up before 
the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to have to give Woody a call," Lukas joked, referring to New York 
trainer Woody Stephens. Stephens saddled a record five consecutive Belmont 
winners starting in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not crazy about the mile and a half," Lukas said. "But we'll try it. I 
may not bring the horse to New York until a few days before the race, just I 
like I did at the Preakness. I'm thinking of shipping him back to Churchill 
Downs, where he trained before he came here." 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas says that at 1 1/2 miles the Belmont is outmoded. "I'm not saying that 
they shouldn't have mile and a half races," he said. "I'm just saying that they 
shouldn't make a mile-and-a-half race a fixture of American racing." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the nine horses whom Tabasco Cat beat in the Preakness, at least two -- 
Kentucky Derby winner Go For Gin, who was second, and Kandaly, who was fourth 
-- are expected to run in the Belmont. Kandaly, the Louisiana Derby winner who 
had never raced on medication, bled from the lungs in the Preakness. Lasix, the 
medication to prevent such bleeding, is prohibited in New York, but Louie 
Roussel, the colt's trainer and part owner, said there are legal ways of 
treating the horse's condition. 
</P>
<P>
 In what appears to be a small Belmont field, other probable starters are 
Strodes Creek, who was second in the Kentucky Derby, and Brocco, the Santa 
Anita Derby winner who was fourth at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect my horse to run big in the Belmont," said Go For Gin's trainer, Nick 
Zito. "He came out of the Preakness in great shape and he loves Belmont." 
</P>
<P>
 The Preakness was a clean race, two weeks after the rough-and-tumble Derby, 
but there were still trainers with excuses. Besides bleeding badly, Powis 
Castle, who finished next to last, was diagnosed as having pharyngitis, a 
disorder that impairs breathing, and Blumin Affair might have suffered a 
problem that affected his breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the erratic start that eliminated Numerous, who came into the 
Preakness off a victory in the Kentucky Derby Trial. "He ducked to the right 
when the door opened," jockey Pat Valenzuela said. "I was lucky I stayed on 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous finished fifth, beaten by nine lengths. His trainer, Charlie 
Whittingham, will saddle Strodes Creek in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
 Before running sixth in the Kentucky Derby, Tabasco Cat ran second in the 
Santa Anita Derby, behind Brocco and one length in front of Strodes Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strodes Creek will have his supporters in the Belmont, I'm sure," Lukas said. 
"But he's still got to run by some horses. I'm not saying he won't turn out to 
be a nice horse. But let's not bronze him and put the statue in the infield 
yet."

HOLLYWOOD PARK; MEGAN'S INTERCO BREAKS TRACK RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The losing streak of Megan's Interco didn't last very long. 
</P>
<P>
 Five weeks after his five-race winning streak ended in the El Rincon Handicap 
at Santa Anita, the 5-year-old gelding rebounded with a record-setting victory 
despite losing his left front shoe in the $109,200 Shoemaker Handicap Sunday at 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Never far off the pace set by Norwich, who upset him in the El Rincon, Megan's 
Interco took charge entering the stretch and went on to beat Furiously by a 
length in 1:32 3/5 for the mile on turf. That broke the course record of 1:32 
4/5 set by Miesque when she won the Breeders' Cup Mile on Nov. 21, 1987 and 
equaled by Journalism in the 1993 Shoemaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Milt Bronson and trained by Jenine Sahadi, Megan's Interco, the 2-1 
favorite, has won nine of 17 lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 Furiously, improving on the grass after finishing last in the San Bernardino 
Handicap on dirt, finished four lengths clear of Rapan Boy. Johann Quatz was 
fourth, then came Norwich and Earl Of Barking, the 4-1 second choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful that he got the track record," Sahadi said. "I knew he could 
do it and I'm just so excited for him. This horse is like a godsend. He has the 
greatest personality at the barn, he's so fun to be around and he loves to 
train." 
</P>
<P>
 Jockey Corey Black said: "I kicked (Megan's Interco) in gear at the 
quarter-pole and he found another gear that I didn't even know he had. I didn't 
know who was behind me, but I knew they better be running."

 Hollywood Park stewards Pete Pedersen, Ingrid Fermin and Tom Ward issued a 
ruling Sunday voiding the claim of Johnny Mc by Inside Track Racing on April 
29. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bizarre mixup, the identities of Johnny Mc and Stalvoy were switched for 
more than a month before the mistake was discovered last Thursday. Stalvoy, not 
Johnny Mc, ran in the race in which he was claimed by Inside Track and trainer 
Bob Hess Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirage Stable, the owners of Johnny Mc, were ordered to return the $25,000 
they received for the claim to Hollywood Park's paymaster of purses.

PAYYAK OVERCOMES HIS SHARE OF BAD BREAKS; BADMINTON: THE CORONA DEL MAR 
ATHLETE'S DURABILITY, DETERMINATION IS CRUCIAL IN SECTION TEAM COMPETITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HUANG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A week before the Southern Section individual badminton championships, Jerome 
Payyak injured his leg in a car accident. Two days before the championships, he 
broke his racket. The day of the tournament, he used birds that he had played 
with only once all season. But through it all, he didn't complain. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gives 100%," Corona del Mar assistant coach Chau Nguyen said. "He doesn't 
give excuses." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the string of bad luck, the junior advanced to the boys' singles 
semifinals, losing to eventual champion Jerry Wong of Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than dwell on the what-ifs, Payyak is looking ahead to the Southern 
Section Division I team semifinals, where the Sea Kings will face defending 
champion Alhambra Keppel today at Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's other semifinal, Garden Grove faces No. 3-seeded La Puente Nogales 
at La Puente. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to be more pressure put on you in the team (competition)," Payyak 
said. "You can win every singles tournament and then lose at CIF and it doesn't 
mean a thing. CIF is the final, big tournament. It counts the most." 
</P>
<P>
 For Payyak, there is a better reason to play well today. After being placed on 
academic probation most of the season, Payyak was reinstated the day before 
Corona del Mar's final league match against Century, April 28. Playing singles 
and mixed doubles, Payyak earned three of the team's 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Sea Kings' first two playoff matches, Payyak was undefeated in singles 
and mixed doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 So how important is it for the Sea Kings to have Payyak back in the lineup? 
</P>
<P>
 "He's extremely important. Jerome can control three points with his three 
wins," said senior Jason Eggleston, who plays No. 1 boys' doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, the consequences of being on academic probation didn't hit Payyak. 
In fact, it might have helped the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think us playing without Jerome made our team that much better because 
everyone had to play harder," doubles player Kristy Macfarland said. "We 
couldn't count on him winning, but now that he's back, it's important for us 
because we can count on his points." 
</P>
<P>
 While Payyak was on probation, the Sea Kings were undefeated in league play. 
Payyak trained with Nguyen so he would be able to compete as an individual at 
the Pacific Coast League championships and the Southern Section championships. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 12, Corona del Mar lost its only match of the season to Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we lost to Century, I knew it was all my fault," Payyak said. "We need 
to play as a team and if anyone leaves, it can throw off the whole team." 
</P>
<P>
 Payyak began training seriously with Nguyen, the 1992 Southern Section boys' 
singles champion from Estancia, during his sophomore season. Last summer, 
Nguyen worked with Payyak on his footwork and shot placement. 
</P>
<P>
 "His game has improved dramatically since last season," Nguyen said. "We 
really worked on his footwork because he's not the quickest person. We had to 
get him to move around the court more." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his lack of team competitions, Payyak has a 22-2 singles record, 
winning the boys' singles title at the league championships and the Alhambra 
tournament. His only two losses this season have been to Wong at the Southern 
Section finals and the Alta Loma tournament, where he lost a three-setter to 
Keppel's Sandy Tirtadjaja in the singles semifinals, 17-15, 11-15, 15-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Payyak defeated Tirtadjaja in the quarterfinals of the Southern Section 
championships, 15-11, 15-9. Today's team semifinals will be a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm motivated to play him," Payyak said. "I definitely want to beat him 
again. Everyone knows that Keppel is the team to beat. We have to play our best 
and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Pat Wilson believes Payyak's return to the team is the difference 
between winning and losing for the Sea Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 However, against a team as balanced and as strong as Keppel, it might take 
more than Payyak's return. The Aztecs, who have a 95-match winning streak, 
begin the semifinal matchup top-seeded. Before moving up to Division I last 
season, the Aztecs had won three consecutive Division II team titles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having Payyak back gives us a chance against any good team," Wilson said, 
"but we need seven more like him to have a chance against Keppel." Badminton 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Wilson says the Sea Kings' depth has been their biggest strength all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're balanced," Wilson said. "We've never been shut out in any category." 
</P>
<P>
 In boys' doubles, the Sea Kings are led by Tim Wertin and Jason Eggleston. The 
girls are lead by No. 1 singles player Allysun Turner and the No. 1 doubles 
team of Kerry Smith and Trina Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the team is young and inexperienced compared to Keppel, which has 
five Southern Section individual finalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty much this is our learning experience," Chau Nguyen said. "Keppel is a 
very strong team and they are very serious." 
</P>
<P>
 In the other semifinals, No. 3-seeded Garden Grove will face No. 2-seeded La 
Puente Nogales. The Argonauts' biggest strength is their balance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a strong team and a couple of really elite players," Argonaut Coach 
Vicki Toutz said. In singles, the Argonauts are led by junior Judy Pak, the 
Garden Grove League girls' singles champion, who is 44-6 this season, and Vil 
Nonlibuon, who is 40-8 record. Their No. 1 boys' double team of Dung Chu and 
David Nguyen are 35-5 this season, and Chu and Pak have compiled a 23-5 record 
at the No. 1 mixed position. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't see (Nogales) in any of the cross-over events this season, so I'm 
not sure how strong their team is," Toutz said. "I'm very pleased with the 
performance of our team so far. They played very well against a tough 
(Alhambra) team (in the quarterfinals). I think we are peaking at the right 
time."

TRAGIC COMEDY OF BASEBALL SENT BERADINO INTO ACTING; DRAMA: A VETERAN OF 
"GENERAL HOSPITAL" LOOKS BACK SOMEWHAT FONDLY ON HIS DIAMOND DAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The St. Louis Browns lost 111 games in 1939 and 102 in 1951. In 1952, the 
Pittsburgh Pirates lost 112. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Beradino played for all three of those miserable teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the worst teams there ever were," Beradino said at lunch recently, 
chuckling at the thought. "And the cheapest." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Pirates had finished 54 1/2 games behind the National League 
champion Brooklyn Dodgers, Beradino retired from baseball, returned to 
California and took up acting full time. Casting calls seemed more palatable 
than another season of playing utility infield in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Beradino was almost 36. His back had never healed after he had fallen 
off a Navy Jeep at Pearl Harbor and, truth be known, he had been acting longer 
than he had been playing ball. He was in a few "Our Gang" comedies as a youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Beradino suspected that wages for acting couldn't be more paltry than what the 
doormats of baseball were paying him. 
</P>
<P>
 How cheap were they? Well, Beradino was an infielder for the Browns from 1939 
to 1947, with more than three years out for military service in World War II, 
and the least he expected in 1944, when the Browns won their only pennant, was 
a token partial share from the World Series. During the war, it was a common 
practice for World Series teams to reward their absent service personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after the Browns were beaten by their intracity rivals, the 
Cardinals, in a six-game Series, a small package arrived for Beradino at Pearl 
Harbor. Inside was a deck of playing cards with the Browns' logo. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was it," Beradino said. "My Series bonus." 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns paid their batboy, Bobby Scanlon, $500. 
</P>
<P>
 Beradino made his own good deal, though, after the 1947 season. The Browns had 
traded him to the Washington Senators for second baseman Gerry Priddy. Beradino 
told the Senators he wasn't going to report because he was quitting to become 
an actor. A few days later, Bill Veeck, who owned the Cleveland Indians and 
needed a spare infielder, tried to talk Beradino out of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Veeck, who later became one of Beradino's best baseball friends, agreed to 
double his salary and pay the premiums on a $1-million insurance policy in case 
a bad hop messed up Beradino's face. 
</P>
<P>
 Beradino wanted a little more. 
</P>
<P>
 "For every 100,000 fans over 2 million, give me a $1,000 bonus," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Johnny, that's crazy," Veeck said. "We'll never draw 2 million." 
</P>
<P>
 They struck the deal, though, and Veeck bought Beradino from the cash-strapped 
Browns for $65,000. Then the Indians, after a three-way pennant battle with the 
Red Sox and the Yankees, beat Boston in a playoff game and also won the World 
Series, drawing 2.6 million. Beradino's bonus was $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 He needed all of it. Waiting for Hollywood to call, Beradino hocked his Series 
ring and his golf clubs to ease a cash crisis. In downtown Los Angeles, a 
pawnbroker noted that Beradino's name was engraved on the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, I'd give $60 for a ring of this type," he told Beradino. "But I 
think you'll be back to get this. Make it $80." 
</P>
<P>
 Beradino now wears the ring on his right pinky. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1964, he auditioned for the part of an internist in a new afternoon soap 
opera on television. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I get it, I don't like the idea of being tied up," he said to his agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't worry about that," the agent said. "Do the pilot, and take the money 
and run." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Beradino realized that he had signed a five-year contract. The 
pilot had legs, though, and the 76-year-old Beradino is now in his 31st year on 
"General Hospital." He has dropped the second R from his real name, Berardino, 
and his character, Dr. Steve Hardy, is now the chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days when the show was done live, Beradino once asked if his friend, 
Yogi Berra, could do a cameo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll use him, but not in a speaking part," Beradino was told. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later, the squat Berra waddled past the cameras. He might have 
been dressed in white, but he was still Yogi Berra. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's that?" said an actress playing a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Dr. Berra, the new staff psychiatrist," the other nurse said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Beradino worked both sides of the street, prejudice was a two-edged 
sword. In a time when anything longer than a brush cut was considered radical, 
his hair showed slightly under his baseball cap. The bench jockeys were 
merciless. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hollywood, directors looked askance at Beradino, a boy of summer, a 
thespian wanna-be. 
</P>
<P>
 "They frowned on athletes acting," Beradino said. "They never took an athlete 
seriously. They thought we were inept, that we couldn't have any creative 
talents in us." 
</P>
<P>
 That was quite an act those Browns put on in '39, imitating a ballclub while 
losing 111 times and finishing 64 1/2 games behind the Yankees. Beradino, whose 
lifetime average was .249, batted .256 in his first season, driving in 58 runs. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a strict major league rule against fraternization then, but the 
Yankees liked Beradino, and when they went to St. Louis for a series, the 
rookie was invited to the Chase Hotel for a long-running party the night before 
the first game. Lefty Gomez was one of the ringleaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving at the suite, Beradino was greeted by a washtub of iced beer in the 
middle of the room, and a well stocked liquor bar on the side. 
</P>
<P>
 "The party went on forever," Beradino said. "After a while, I thought to 
myself that no matter what my teammates were doing that night, they couldn't be 
in as much trouble as the Yankees were. The series opener was the next 
afternoon, and I said to myself that now we'd probably beat these guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a rookie, what did I know? The score was something like 14-2, Yankees. 
And that's the way it went all year long." 
</P>
<P>
 Beradino drove in 85 runs in 1940, and the next season, as a third-year man 
playing shortstop, he seemed on the verge of a breakthrough, batting .271 with 
89 RBIs. In 469 trips to the plate, he struck out only 27 times. 
</P>
<P>
 But 1942 was mostly lost to the service and he missed the next three seasons, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hurt my back bad in that Jeep accident," he said. "They had me in a plaster 
cast for eight weeks. It itched like crazy. I cut the damn thing off finally. 
When I went for my discharge a little later, nobody noticed. Nobody asked me 
what had happened to the cast." 
</P>
<P>
 Beradino never played regularly after the war. By 1951, Veeck owned the Browns 
and he and Beradino had a reunion in St. Louis, Beradino joining the club as a 
player-coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did it as a favor," Beradino said. "It saved Bill a salary." 
</P>
<P>
 Beradino was on the bench, watching, that Aug. 19, when Eddie Gaedel, wearing 
uniform No. 1/8 and standing 3 feet 7, walked as a pinch-hitter against the 
Detroit Tigers. The American League in effect threw Veeck's one-shot midget out 
of baseball the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hardly anybody knew what was up," Beradino said. "We couldn't figure out what 
was happening when they brought that little guy out of the clubhouse to start 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a big crowd that day, a notable exception that season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't get over the Dodgers drawing 80,000 (a game) when they first moved 
to L.A. and played in the Coliseum," Beradino said. "I thought back that we 
didn't draw much more than that all year in '51." 
</P>
<P>
 Youngsters in St. Louis at the time all knew how easy it was to sneak into the 
empty box seats from the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure," Beradino said, "Veeck couldn't afford too many ushers." 
</P>
<P>
 Some good fairies in Baltimore waved their magic wands over the Browns in 
1954, turning them into the Orioles, and a franchise that never paid an annual 
salary higher than $25,000 was no more.

POLITICIAN'S RAIDER ROLE CALLED BAD PR BY FERRARO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Council President John Ferraro, who is also the Coliseum 
commissioner, said Alameda County Supervisor Don Perata, who is running for the 
Democratic nomination for state controller, isn't "helping his image in L.A." 
by trying to entice the Raiders back to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraro wondered how Perata could be seeking Southern California votes while 
at the same time trying "to steal L.A's football team." 
</P>
<P>
 But Perata insisted Oakland is only trying to help Los Angeles out of its 
earthquake troubles when it offers Davis a contract to return to the 
Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum for one year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know John (Ferraro) and I'm very fond of him," Perata said. "All this has 
never been an effort to steal but simply to make available an alternative 
playing site in California should the L.A. Coliseum not be ready to perform." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles officials said, however, that the Coliseum will be ready for the 
first Raider regular-season game against the Seattle Seahawks on Sept. 11.

BOOK REVIEW / FICTION; A FUNNY TALE ABOUT THE ORDINARY, AMAZING FOLKS OF GROUSE 
COUNTY; THE END OF VANDALISM BY TOM DRURY ; HOUGHTON MIFFLIN $21.95; 321 PAGES 
</P>

<P>
 You don't have to sell the house, uproot the family and change careers to find 
out if life would really be better in a place like Grouse County, Iowa. Reading 
Tom Drury's novel gives you the whole picture, and by the time you've met his 
cast of 58, you should be able to tell if you'd fit in. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to a considerate list of characters at the end of "The End of 
Vandalism," keeping the people straight isn't a problem. In any case, some of 
them are children and play relatively minor roles. The rest are both 
distinctive and memorable. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the list, you wouldn't ever confuse Larry Longhair, the itinerant 
gambler, with Deputy Sheriff Ed Aiken, or mix up Louise Darling, who eventually 
marries Ed, with Joan Gower, who catches people at odd moments to read them 
Bible verses. Louise's ex-husband, Tiny Darling, who works as a plumber when he 
isn't busy as a burglar, is a true original. There's no chance of mistaking him 
for anyone else; Tiny doesn't even lend himself to comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiny plays a small but heavily symbolic role in the book. In the first 
chapter, we learn that he smashed up the vandalism collage at the high school's 
"End of Vandalism" dance. The display had been built in shop class and 
consisted of a "row of tall, pointed wooden slats with a double-hung window 
built in and a flashing yellow light bolted to one side" -- items chosen 
because picket fences, windows and the warning lights placed by the highway 
department on bridges are the most popular targets for juvenile pranksters.  
</P>
<P>
 Vandalism is apparently a real problem in Grouse County. At one point a couple 
of adolescents climb the water tower and spray paint the names of rock stars on 
it. The author also mentions an out-of-state Mercedes defaced with "This is 
Indian Land." (The car belonged to a Colorado developer browsing around Iowa 
for building sites, but that's not really an excuse, just an explanation.) 
</P>
<P>
 Even Louise Darling, Sheriff Ed Aiken's intended, has a bit of vandalism on 
her record. Louise once sneaked into the boys' locker room and spray painted 
the football helmets, an event remembered by people not even in Louise's 
graduation class. There are other antisocial acts committed in Grouse County, 
but few are quite as serious. Outhouse-tipping, of course, is no longer as 
common as it once was, now that virtually everyone has indoor plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The End of Vandalism" is a remarkably funny book without being in the least 
frivolous. The humor, in fact, comes less from the incidents themselves as from 
Drury's arresting style, which is both utterly matter of fact and astonishingly 
vivid. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Joe Norman, Dan's father and a retired pharmaceutical salesman. Twice 
widowed, Dan has tried an assortment of hobbies with limited success. After 
abandoning golf when he ran an electric cart into the clubhouse, he took up 
wood burning, "but lost interest once he had put decorative brands on every 
wooden item in the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he carries a video camera with him, hoping to tape something newsworthy. 
But because Grouse County has never had either a runaway felon beaten by the 
Highway Patrol or a convenience-store robbery, Joe is reduced to taping the 
mailman on his daily rounds, an old friend washing a Buick and the nighttime 
antics of raccoons raiding trash cans. If you need an antidote to "Action News" 
or the Metro section of this paper, Drury's book works wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everything is comedic. Certainly when Dan Norman follows up on a phone tip 
and discovers a baby abandoned in a box in a shopping cart at the Hy-Vee 
parking lot, we know we're still in the 1990s, the decade of the bizarre. But 
because it's Grouse County, the whole town leaves gifts for the baby, who seems 
destined to have the local version of a happy childhood, once the adoption can 
be finalized. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Louise finally marries Dan, their bliss is marred by tragedy -- 
although somehow Drury leaves us convinced that after Louise returns from a 
visit to relatives in Minnesota, she and Dan will recover from their sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Drury has been compared to Garrison Keillor and Raymond Carver, he's 
really in a class of one, creating characters who only seem larger than life 
because life itself, in Grouse County, Iowa, may not be quite as theatrical as 
it is in some other places. It's a question of relativity. Ordinary people have 
the chance to be amazing when the world around them is tranquil, even humdrum.

KOREAN AMERICANS STILL PONDER FATE OF EDWARD CHO; CULTURE: SOME FEEL O.C. 
DEVELOPER, WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE AFTER CHILD-MOLESTATION CONVICTION, WAS A 
VICTIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The two-hour home video could have been a chronicle of any happy, suburban 
family over a 10-year period, a house full of proud parents and growing 
children on a number of joyous occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 They celebrate birthdays. They take family trips to American landmarks. In one 
culturally distinctive ceremony for this affluent Korean American family, the 
children come forward one by one and bow to their father, touching their 
foreheads to the floor in a gesture of obeisance and respect. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no hint of what was to ensue. The father, Kyung Mook (Edward) Cho, 
54, a multimillionaire Orange County real estate developer, was accused of 
molesting four of his children. His eldest daughter and her boyfriend committed 
suicide soon afterward, another daughter denounced him in court as "possessed 
by Satan," and a year ago this month he was convicted of 25 counts of sexual 
abuse and child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cho's 84-year prison sentence on Dec. 17, followed by his shocking Christmas 
Day suicide in the Orange County Jail, drew headlines throughout Southern 
California. But it was in the region's Korean American community -- where Cho 
was already something of a controversial figure -- that the tragic saga 
provoked the most soul-searching and continues to puzzle many. 
</P>
<P>
 While the judge in the case called his behavior "despicable" and his children 
were devastated by what happened, Cho continued to assert his innocence in the 
days after his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 In half a dozen open letters to Korean American newspapers, Cho suggested that 
he was the victim of scheming children and that an all-white Orange County jury 
didn't understand authoritarian -- but not abusive -- Korean family practices. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was extensively covered in the Korean American press; Cho's letters 
prompted much debate within the community, and his suicide added to it. Did he 
kill himself, overwhelmed by guilt, in the face of a long prison sentence? Or 
was his suicide a final declaration of innocence not to be ignored? 
</P>
<P>
 "People are confused because Mr. Cho killed himself," said Dr. Injong Hong, 
executive director of the L.A. Korean Family Counseling and Legal Advice 
Center. "Some people believe he killed himself to prove he was innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 Months after the suicide, Hong said recently, some Korean Americans are "still 
struggling with what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, there are many in the Korean American community who believe that 
Edward Cho was the victim of vindictive children who rebelled against his 
strict, traditional parenting by inventing unthinkable charges against their 
father, accusations believed by the jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Culture killed him," said Chris Nam, vice president of the Korean Assn. of 
Orange County, who emigrated from the same Korean village as his friend Cho. 
</P>
<P>
 Cho strongly asserted the same point. In a letter to his minister -- written 
from the Orange County Jail and later published in two Korean-language 
newspapers -- Cho contended that "Orange County's all-white jurors' biases and 
their inability to understand other cultures brought about" his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because child sexual abuse is virtually unheard of in the Korean 
American community, the case generated more than 50 articles in the Korean 
press, including the open letters from Cho. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many Koreans, more than half, don't want to believe it," said Brian Min, a 
reporter for the Korea Times' Los Angeles Edition, who covered the case. 
</P>
<P>
 During a custody case and a criminal trial, and in documents filed for a civil 
lawsuit over Cho's estate, Cho's children argued that Cho's behavior grew from 
his feudal notion that they were his property. 
</P>
<P>
 Cho's son claimed at the criminal trial that his father sexually abused him 
because Cho appeared to believe that "he owned me or something. I was his 
property." Cho lost custody of the boy and his sister, who were still living at 
home, in a Juvenile Court proceeding, but jurors in the criminal trial 
acquitted Cho of charges of fondling his son. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes Korean fathers exert unreasonable discipline or exercise an 
authoritarian way of rearing children, which creates tremendous emotional 
turmoil in their children," agreed Moon Ju Kim, education minister at Bethel 
Korean Church in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a Korean American female," said Erica M. Kim, one of Edward Cho's civil 
attorneys, "and I know the pressures. Korean parents feel that if there is no 
pressure, kids will go out and do what they want." 
</P>
<P>
 The revelations that have poured out in the three court proceedings stand in 
stark contrast to the idyllic image of a successful, suburban American 
household that the Cho family offered to the world outside. 
</P>
<P>
 After immigrating to the U.S. in 1971, Cho prospered in Orange County, 
concentrating his real estate business in Garden Grove and amassing holdings 
that at one time were estimated at nearly $3.5 million. He lived in a large 
house in Fountain Valley and worked his way to prominence in the Korean 
American business community. 
</P>
<P>
 But even before allegations of sexual abuse were made against him in 1992, 
Edward Cho was a controversial figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people in the Korean community didn't like him because they thought he 
was like Scrooge," said Myong Hwan (David) Son, one of Cho's best and oldest 
friends. Cho was well-known for his reluctance to pick up a meal check, and he 
argued over bets at weekly, penny-ante poker games, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, Cho made large donations to a variety of civic and 
cultural organizations, said Son, a frequent visitor to Cho's home. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, just a few years after moving to the area from Northern California, 
Cho was elected president of the Korean Assn. of Orange County, largely because 
he was the only candidate that year willing to put up the $10,000 required to 
serve, according to Tom Kim, who was then the association's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Cho's tenure lasted only a few months and ended in acrimony when he changed 
his mind about serving and demanded his money back, Kim said. He filed suit 
against several of the association's former presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 All of those who knew Cho -- family members, business associates, attorneys 
and even his minister -- agreed that he was a strict disciplinarian, an 
authoritarian father who inflicted corporal punishment when necessary. He tried 
to exert almost total control over his children's lives, dictating everything 
from whom they could befriend to what colleges they would attend and what 
professions they would pursue, friends and family said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Korean household, the father is the dominant figure," said Erica Kim, 
Cho's civil attorney. "Everyone obeys everything that Dad says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Cho was an extreme example of that," she added. "He was extremely stingy, 
very shrewd, very bright, very aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth of eight children born to poor, uneducated parents in a rural 
Korean village, Edward Cho worked his way through a church college in Seoul. 
Upon his arrival in the United States, he worked as a Seventh-day Adventist 
minister in the Northern California community of San Lorenzo for eight years. 
After a short-lived marriage that produced two children, Cho remarried and had 
two more children. 
</P>
<P>
 Cho had increasing success in Northern California as a restaurateur and real 
estate developer. But his life as a conventional family man was interrupted in 
1983, when he moved to Los Angeles and sent to Korea for two more of his 
daughters from a previous relationship, Young Sun Cho and her younger sister. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened between 1983 and 1992, in various residences in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties, is documented in police reports, in testimony at Cho's 
eight-day criminal trial and in documents filed in connection with the civil 
suit brought by four of Edward Cho's children. Despite Cho's death, that suit 
will be tried against Cho's estate and his widow. 
</P>
<P>
 Further documentation comes from a juvenile custody hearing during which the 
two youngest Cho children were removed from the home. Normally confidential, 
testimony and rulings from that hearing were printed in documents filed for the 
civil trial and in an appeals court decision upholding the removal of the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after her father brought her from Korea, Young Sun Cho later told 
authorities, her father began forcing her to have sex with him. She was 14 at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just comes in, and I will be laying there," Young Sun Cho testified at the 
preliminary hearing, "and he . . . will just have sex with me. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 By acquiescing to her father, Young Sun Cho testified, "I always thought I was 
protecting my sister . . . from him having sex with her . . . him abusing her." 
</P>
<P>
 But, the younger sister testified, Edward Cho also began to abuse her sexually 
at the age of 9 and continued to do so for nine years. Both daughters said they 
were unaware the other was being victimized. 
</P>
<P>
 "Afterwards he said, 'Well, I'll buy you a Rolls-Royce' . . . I felt really 
cheap," the younger daughter testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Sun Cho said in the preliminary hearing that her father had twice 
impregnated her and forced her to undergo abortions, a claim Edward Cho denied. 
</P>
<P>
 The children testified at Cho's trial that their father also regularly kicked 
and beat them and his wife, sometimes with a stick and a tennis racquet. He 
threw bowls and furniture at them, they said. Cho's widow acknowledged that her 
husband physically disciplined the children, but denied that he was brutal. 
</P>
<P>
 In early 1992, Young Sun Cho, then 23, moved out of the house. Several months 
later, on April 23, she contacted the Orange County Department of Social 
Services Child Abuse Registry, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 6, Young Sun Cho and her younger sister repeated their charges to 
Fountain Valley police. On May 11, the Department of Social Services removed 
the two younger children from the home. The younger children also testified 
later about inappropriate touching by their father. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Cho was arrested several days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Five months after bringing the sex abuse charges, Young Sun Cho and her 
boyfriend, who had encouraged her to come forward, killed themselves in their 
Los Angeles apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt in my mind that Young Sun killed herself due to the abuse," 
Detective Kim Brown of the Fountain Valley Police Department wrote in a report. 
"In talking with her, she was very disturbed about the sexual abuse and the 
methods of fear used by their father to make her submit. The torment he caused 
fueled her decision to take her own life." 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Cho's younger daughter testified in his subsequent criminal trial on 
rape and sexual molestation charges, and the testimony of Young Sun Cho at an 
earlier hearing was read to the jury. Both said that their father told them 
that such sexual activity was permitted by the Bible, and that they should 
pretend he was a movie star during sex. 
</P>
<P>
 During the custody proceedings, Edward Cho vigorously denied the abuse 
charges, and at his criminal trial said he had not forced his daughter to have 
the abortions. On the witness stand, he called the charges "unthinkable," the 
accusations "gross, heinous things." 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Cho steadfastly maintained that the crimes never occurred. Speaking 
through an interpreter, he said at his sentencing that sending him to prison 
would be "a sad miscarriage of justice." 
</P>
<P>
 His younger daughter, Edward Cho said, was "imagining these things. . . . She 
wants to get back at me, to get her revenge. . . . I have tried to be a good 
father." 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Cho's attorney, John Barnett, invoked the Salem witch trials, telling 
the jury at Cho's criminal trial that Cho's older daughters were 
"sophisticated, and they (were) cunning, and they knew what they wanted. And 
what they wanted was not vindication . . . hat they wanted was money. . . . 
There was not any sex . . . that didn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 When he was out on bail awaiting trial, Edward Cho had assembled the two-hour 
home video of happy family occasions spanning a decade. He put it together 
"because he thought if the jury had an opportunity to see it, it would 
basically convince everybody that they had a happy family life and everything 
was normal," said Erica Kim, his civil attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barnett said he did not attempt to introduce the tape at the criminal 
trial because he felt the sequences showing the Cho children bowing to him -- 
in one case in exchange for money -- might be misinterpreted by jurors and 
damage Cho's case. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 5, 1993, a jury found Cho guilty of 25 counts of sexual abuse against 
three of his children. He was acquitted of molesting his son. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The civil lawsuit was filed on behalf of four of Cho's six children: the two 
minors, who are now in foster care, a daughter who is in college and Young Sun 
Cho, who committed suicide after the lawsuit was filed. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit asks for $13 million or whatever remains of Edward Cho's real 
estate holdings. The children also sued Edward Cho's wife for allegedly 
allowing the molestation to occur. Depositions in the case are now being taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the Cho estate and his widow have responded by blaming his two 
older daughters for a plot to acquire his wealth -- a charge they deny. 
</P>
<P>
 But money -- even a great deal of money -- would not have been enough 
temptation for the Cho children to expose themselves to the shame that is 
experienced by victims of incest and sexual abuse, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dragging your family in, bringing such a suit is a big disgrace," said Dr. 
Eun Mee Kim, associate professor of sociology at USC. "No amount of money can 
restore their name." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, to the day he was found hanging in his jail cell from a noose of braided, 
torn bedsheets, Edward Cho maintained that what happened to him could happen to 
any stern Korean parent. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were to go to jail as a criminal," he wrote in a letter to the Orange 
County United Korea Student Assn., "then our 30 million Koreans should all go 
to prison."

STUDENTS GIVE FAILING GRADE TO CLAS TEST; EDUCATION: MANY FIND FORMAT INVASIVE, 
CONFUSING. OFFICIALS SAY EXAM RATES SKILLS, NOT PERSONAL BELIEFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Eighth-grader Jennie Hoffman was angry. 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't like the poem she had just read about an overprotective mother who 
refused to let her son make new friends, and now the controversial CLAS test 
required Jennie to answer a dozen questions about it -- including some she 
thought were too personal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true: When you're mad, you write more," Jennie said during a break in 
testing at Millikan Middle School in Sherman Oaks. "But I don't think it's 
right for a test to make you mad. These aren't questions that are right and 
wrong. It's just what kids think." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics across the state use similar arguments against the California Learning 
Assessment System tests. They say the exams are more psychological than 
academic and that they invade students' privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 To the supporters, however, the CLAS tests are doing exactly what they were 
designed to do: engage students in interesting and provocative reading material 
and prompt them to write with conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask students whether the CLAS tests are passing or failing and the responses 
are strong and visceral. Some said they made up answers because they feared 
telling the truth. Others said they resented having to relate a poem or short 
story to their own lives. And others said they used generalizations rather than 
actual details in response to essay and short-answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was more like a survey," said Justin Canel, a Millikan 14-year-old. "A 
test is when you sit at a desk, you don't talk and you answer the questions -- 
otherwise you fail. This is testing if you have good common sense. A test is 
just more strict. A test is better." 
</P>
<P>
 Other students said they found the untraditional form of the exam confusing. 
Unlike their experience with other exams, they were encouraged to discuss the 
material in groups and try out their thinking on classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't know whether you're supposed to impress the people who are reading 
it or say what you really felt and thought about the reading," said Michelle 
Lloren, a 10th-grader at Cleveland High School in Reseda. "I think all the 
money they spent on these tests should have been spent on buying English books 
that we could read during our classes." 
</P>
<P>
 The only way to impress the test scorers, say teachers and state education 
officials, is to write clearly and proficiently. What the students say in their 
essays is unimportant -- even hypothetical answers to questions about their 
personal life are fine since the graders won't be evaluating the content, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 What is important, they say, is the way students think and write about the 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure kids do make up some examples -- but that's not what we're looking 
for," said Jill Wilson, a consultant with the state Department of Education. 
"We're looking for writing and all the characteristics of good writing." 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials who designed the exams said the reading sections 
were carefully selected to encourage students to write and analyze literature 
in new ways. The tests measure students against tough statewide standards based 
on a more rigorous academic curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to engage them enough so they care and they are more likely to 
discuss with energy and to write with conviction," Wilson said. "We encourage 
students to challenge, to disagree and to take their own stands and not 
necessarily accept the point of view in a story or a poem." 
</P>
<P>
 But nowhere on the test are students informed that they are being evaluated on 
their ability to think and express themselves rather than the content of what 
they write. And although some teachers tell their students what they are being 
tested on, there is no such standardized procedure to prepare classes for the 
exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of Los Angeles Unified School District students faced the tests last 
week for the first time since the controversy over the contents of the CLAS 
exams erupted several months ago. Students in the fourth, fifth, eighth and 
10th grades are taking the assessment test. Most schools will be finished 
testing by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the controversy, which has sparked lawsuits across California, the 
state Department of Education allowed school districts to let parents exclude 
their children from taking the tests. Across the Los Angeles school district, 
many parents have done just that. 
</P>
<P>
 While the strongest opposition is centered in the west San Fernando Valley, 
parents from one end of the sprawling district to the other have opted to 
exempt their children from the tests. At Hale Middle School in Woodland Hills, 
for example, 100 students out of 741 were exempted. 
</P>
<P>
 At South Gate Middle School, 40 students opted out. And at Mount Gleason 
Middle School in Sunland, 20 students were exempted. At some schools, such as 
Carson High and Gage Middle School in Huntington Park, just one student chose 
not to take the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither district nor state officials are currently keeping track of the 
numbers of parents who are refusing to allow their children to take the test. 
State education officials said they will have to evaluate whether lower numbers 
of students taking the tests will affect some overall school and district 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles school principals were told last week to compile lists of exempted 
students and keep files of letters from parents. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than a week of taking the tests, students at Millikan said they 
were asked subjective -- and sometimes personal -- questions without clear-cut 
answers. The reading and writing prompted the students to analyze literature in 
ways they've rarely done before using short answers, diagrams and essays. 
</P>
<P>
 Principals and teachers across the district said the tests are better methods 
of assessment than the old-fashioned, multiple-choice exams they are replacing. 
Even college-placement tests are now performance-based. 
</P>
<P>
 But the students clearly aren't impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had one question asking if I had regrets about something," said Devin 
Johnson, a Millikan 14-year-old. "I was thinking for a long time. It was a real 
personal question. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone I know made up the answer," she said, drawing a round of laughter 
from her classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're grading us on our opinions -- if they don't agree with us, are our 
answers wrong?" asked Piruza Papazyan, a fellow Millikan student. 
</P>
<P>
 The critics, who range from conservative religious groups to individual 
parents, say students should not be given open-ended writing assignments 
without clear-cut, multiple-choice questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's controversy over whether this is a psychological test or an academic 
test," said Chris Trujillo, a North Hollywood parent who demanded that her 
fourth- and eighth-grade children be exempted from the tests. "It's all been so 
secretive. Teachers aren't allowed to speak about it. I just didn't want my 
children exposed to it." 
</P>
<P>
 State officials have denied that the exams -- mandated by the Legislature as 
part of a years-long effort to improve public schools -- are "psychological," 
and they refuse to allow parents to review them prior to the end of the year. 
In June, however, the state Board of Education has agreed to release at least 
portions of the current tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Some educators, like Cleveland High English teacher Nancy Johnston, said she 
is concerned that the reading selections -- which include excerpts of Richard 
Wright's "Black Boy," among others -- are too difficult. "Some (students) could 
be lost at the very first sentence," Johnston said. "Some of our 10th-graders 
are just incapable of reading this without assistance." 
</P>
<P>
 The tests, which were developed and are graded by teams of educators, are 
intended to coincide with new state guidelines for English and other subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 The state encourages students to read and analyze literature in a variety of 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
 But to some parents and students, the subjective nature of the tests is 
questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that if they're going to grade these tests, there should be a right or 
wrong answer," said Janice Reilly, a West Hills parent who refused to allow her 
fourth-grade son to take the tests. "But without that, it would just be the 
opinion of the grader." 
</P>
<P>
 The state does have scoring guidelines, and teachers who read the tests 
discuss answers and decide appropriate numerical scores. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests are designed to determine whether students can write in a convincing 
and coherent way drawing from the reading selections. 
</P>
<P>
 But tell that to the students. "One question asked what kind of problems 
teen-agers have with their parents," said Nikki Addis, a Millikan 14-year-old. 
"This has nothing to do with English. That's personal." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Angel Salais, a Millikan classmate: "That's not a problem in my house. I 
talk to my parents all the time. I didn't know what to write . . . and I don't 
feel like telling anyone about my family."

SEAL BEACH PIER FIRE BLAMED ON SHORT IN WIRES; LANDMARK: ELECTRICAL LINES ALSO 
CAUSED THE 1992 BLAZE, AND THE MAYOR PRO TEM RECOMMENDS ADDRESSING THE 
RECURRING CAUSE WHEN THE WOODEN STRUCTURE IS REBUILT. PRELIMINARY FIGURES PUT 
THE DAMAGE AT $350,000.

 The investigation of a fire that temporarily trapped about 145 people on the 
city pier centered Sunday on electrical and other utility lines running beneath 
the wooden structure built in 1906, according to fire officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a short in one of the lines that supplies power to the businesses 
at the end of the pier," Orange County Fire Capt. Dan Young said Sunday. He 
said the pier will be closed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Flames erupted about 3 p.m. Saturday from a 12,000-kilowatt electrical line 
under the pier. The fire then ran along the pier's old timbers, causing 
extensive damage to a 60-foot-long section and trapping visitors at the seaward 
end. It was the second electrical fire at the pier in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Pro Tem Frank Laszlo said Sunday that the city carries insurance, but 
apparently its coverage has a $100,000 deductible. It's estimated the fire 
caused $350,000 damage, but that preliminary figure could increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have to find out the damage beneath the pier, which has not been 
done yet," Laszlo said. "Then we'll get a full estimate and that's expected to 
be done by (today). 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an electrical fire again, and the last time it was electrical," he 
said. "The cause of the fire needs to be talked about. As for the 
reconstruction of the pier, maybe they both could be consolidated." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will discuss the pier fire tonight, Laszlo said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, passersby peppered firefighters and lifeguards with questions about 
when the popular pier will reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought they would fix it right away because of all the business they have 
at Ruby's (Diner) at the end of the pier," said Leah Notik of Long Beach, who 
visited the pier with her husband, Mendel, and the couple's two children. "We 
heard about the fire, but we thought the pier would be open and we wanted to 
eat at Ruby's." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire destroyed an electrical transformer, knocking out electricity and 
telephone service to the diner and sport fishing shop at the pier's end. 
</P>
<P>
 With telephone service out, city lifeguard supervisor Adam J. Summers said 
Sunday that he dispatched two lifeguards who ran to the pier's midsection, 
dived off at the fire area and swam to the pier's end to help calm those who 
were caught. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want people panicking," Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, rescue boats floated near the pier in case people had to be 
evacuated swiftly, Summers said. If necessary, helicopters would have been 
summoned, lifeguard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 After waiting about two hours while firefighters extinguished the blaze, pier 
visitors were led to safety after sheets of plywood were laid over the charred 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Fire Battalion Chief Kevin Brame said Sunday that the protective 
cover that shields the wooden pier from the elements also caused the thick 
black smoke, making it difficult for firefighters to combat the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second electrical fire at the pier in two years. On May, 15, 1992, 
a wind-whipped fire on the old pier about 50 feet from Saturday's blaze 
destroyed the city's lifeguard tower. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, new wood had just been bought and trucked to the pier to refurbish 
the portions damaged two years ago.

ROYAL DEED CROWNED; FULLERTON RABBI HONORS SON OF BULGARIAN KING WHOSE ACTIONS 
SAVED 50,000 JEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 2,500 worshipers listened as a rabbi read Scripture at the Crystal 
Cathedral on Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "God has blessed us with salvation," read Rabbi Haim Asa, who wore a yarmulke 
and prayer shawl during a service complete with a gospel choir and bells. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, salvation was what the service was all about. For Asa, however, the 
term has direct meaning. He was among the estimated 50,000 Bulgarian Jews -- 
virtually the country's entire Jewish population -- saved from almost certain 
death at the hands of the Nazis by the courageous actions of King Boris III, 
then leader of Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 The rabbi and a smattering of other grateful former subjects were on hand over 
the weekend to honor the now-deceased king in the person of his son, King 
Simeon II. The festivities included a dinner Friday at Sephardic Tifereth 
Israel Temple in Los Angeles and the taping of Sunday's service, part of 
Crystal Cathedral pastor Robert H. Schuller's internationally known television 
show, "Hour of Power." A tour of the Simon Wiesenthal Center Museum of 
Tolerance with Branko Lustig, the Academy Award-winning producer of 
"Schindler's List" and a Holocaust survivor, is scheduled for today. The 
commemoration will culminate in a ceremony tonight in Beverly Hills when King 
Boris is posthumously awarded the Jewish National Fund's Medal of the Legion of 
Honor, becoming the first non-Jew to be given what is one of the highest honors 
bestowed by the Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thank you for the gift of life that your father gave my people," Asa said 
at Sunday's service. Asa, the spiritual leader of Fullerton's Temple Beth 
Tikvah, said his family fled Europe shortly after their lives were saved by the 
king. 
</P>
<P>
 That occurred in 1943 when King Boris III -- whose country was aligned with 
Germany -- refused Adolf Hitler's direct orders to deport Bulgaria's Jewish 
population to Germany for extermination. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the king urged the Jews to move to the countryside and blend in with 
the general population, telling the Fuehrer that he needed the Jews to help 
build roads. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 14, 1943, Boris was summoned by Hitler to Germany, where the two had a 
meeting described by witnesses as a tense and angry showdown over the king's 
lack of cooperation in The Final Solution and his refusal to supply Bulgarian 
troops for the Russian front. Two weeks later, the 49-year-old king died under 
mysterious circumstances in what some believe was a poisoning ordered by 
Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
 King Simeon II, who was 6 years old when his father died, was deposed by the 
Communists who took over after the war. He has lived in exile in Spain ever 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 Asa said his efforts to gain recognition for King Boris' courage began 32 
years ago when he wrote his master's thesis on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 But his effort hit two major obstacles: Bulgaria's Communist regime, which was 
not eager to glorify the monarch it had deposed, and some in the American 
Jewish community, who were unwilling to admit or unaware that a German ally 
could have saved so many. 
</P>
<P>
 That resistance eroded, the rabbi said, after two recent events. In 1990, 
Bulgaria's Communist regime gave way to a democratic form of government. And 
earlier this year, he said, "Schindler's List" -- Steven Spielberg's Academy 
Award-winning movie about a German who saved Jews -- dispelled public 
perceptions that a member of the Axis establishment, by definition, had to be 
an anti-Semite. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you find a man who saved 50,000 Jews, how can you not honor him?" said 
David Horne, Los Angeles chairman for the Jewish National Fund. "It's critical 
for people to know that someone who was the head of a state did something so 
important." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Mandel, president of the American Congress of Jewish Concentration Camp 
Survivors, based in Los Angeles, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "He should have been recognized a long time ago," Mandel said of King Boris. 
Unfortunately, he added, human nature "is never to find somebody who saved, but 
only to persecute the ones who did wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 King Simeon, who seemed near tears during Sunday's service, said he is deeply 
moved by the public recognition of his father's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a son to see such genuine and good-hearted recognition is gratifying," he 
said. "But what my father did was only what any decent person would have done." 
</P>
<P>
 Not necessarily so, according to Asa. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is important because history has to be made an instrument of good, not 
only evil," the rabbi said. "History must teach that there was as much good in 
certain places as there was evil in others."

 A second videotape to surface in the beating death of a 23-year-old Huntington 
Beach woman was being examined by police Sunday while the manhunt continued for 
a recently paroled felon suspected in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The videotape was filmed by a patron inside the Australian Beach Restaurant 
and Nightclub here, where Lenora Annette Wong is believed to have met Edward 
Patrick Morgan, 28, of Orange, before leaving with him early Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Her battered body was later discovered in a parking lot across the street from 
the nightclub. Morgan became the leading suspect in the case later that day 
after an anonymous tipster called police. 
</P>
<P>
 The videotape taken inside the bar, which police confirmed Sunday was in their 
possession, was discovered after police secured another videotape from a 
surveillance camera outside a pharmaceutical company across the street from the 
nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the second videotape may show Morgan and Wong inside the bar 
together, but declined to elaborate on what the tape outside the bar reveals. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan has remained in hiding since police informed him -- through a friend -- 
that he is a suspect in the beating death of Wong and that they want him to 
turn himself in. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police and prison records, Morgan has violent criminal history. 
</P>
<P>
 He was sent to the California Institute for Men at Chino in January, 1985, 
after being convicted of rape. He was paroled in September, 1986, but sent back 
to prison in April, 1991, after unlawful sex with a minor. He served six months 
for that offense before being paroled. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan was convicted of a third offense in 1993, but details were not 
available. He was paroled in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's a predator of the worst kind," Orange Police Lt. Timm Browne 
said Sunday. "He needs to be taken away from the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Browne said investigators have been working around the clock on the case and 
have solicited help from other county law enforcement agencies as well as the 
public in trying to locate Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
 Police searched Morgan's apartment in Orange on Saturday looking for evidence 
in the killing. While officers were there, Morgan called the apartment 
telephone and spoke with investigators, who asked him to turn himself in for 
questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 A short while later, a friend of Morgan's called investigators back asking 
them why they wanted to speak to Morgan. When police refused to explain, the 
friend indicated that Morgan would not surrender for questioning. At that 
point, police told the friend they suspected Morgan in Wong's death. Police 
have not heard from Morgan or the friend since. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about Wong's death or Morgan's whereabouts is 
requested to call Orange police at (714) 744-7444. A $5,000 reward for 
information leading to an arrest in the case has been offered by the bar where 
Wong disappeared.

THE GIFT OF CARING; VOLUNTEER DOCTORS TREAT 10,000 KIDS A YEAR AT TINY FREE 
CLINIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 St. John's Well Child Center is a drafty hole-in-the-wall in a neighborhood 
where $10 can mean the difference between going hungry and feeding a family of 
five. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no high-tech medical equipment or fancy office furniture at the tiny 
South-Central Los Angeles clinic, just a jumble of mismatched file cabinets and 
Formica examination tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it lacks the posh decor, the clinic on West 27th Street is a 
small-scale health services pioneer, offering free medical care on a shoestring 
budget to nearly 10,000 children annually. 
</P>
<P>
 As the economic condition of the neighborhood has spiraled downward into 
extreme poverty, the clinic has stepped into the fray, soothing the wounds and 
comforting needy youngsters, many of them children of recent immigrants who 
survive on $600 a month or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Office hours depend entirely on the availability of a dozen physicians -- 
including some of Los Angeles' top doctors -- who volunteer their time for the 
simple reward of helping the city's poor. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic is open at least three days each week. When it is, the lobby 
bustles with parents and children dressed in clean hand-me-downs. Their voices 
echo through a sunlit hallway that leads to several small examination rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvia De La Rosa, a struggling single mother, started coming here with her 
children nearly seven years ago because she could not afford the cost of a 
private physician. 
</P>
<P>
 With the money she saves on medical exams, De La Rosa can buy ice cream and 
new shoes for her three little ones -- the extras they otherwise would have to 
do without. 
</P>
<P>
 "It not only makes a difference for me, but it also helps a lot of people," 
said De La Rosa, 26, waiting to get shots for her 2-year-old daughter, Esther. 
"There are a lot of people who don't have the resources to go to a regular 
clinic. It's hard nowadays. This makes it a little easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Diana Pitts, a South-Central resident who is attending community college full 
time, brought in her 5-year-old daughter for a routine checkup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figure this will save me about $35," said Pitts, a nursing student. "It 
helps a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Hidden in a rough industrial area near Adams Boulevard and Figueroa Street, 
the clinic opened 30 years ago in a drab, stucco building used for Sunday 
school classrooms by St. John's Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
 It was founded by the parish and members of the Los Angeles Pediatric Society, 
after a church survey found that many of the neighborhood children were not 
receiving immunization for polio, measles and other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the clinic was started simply to administer shots, volunteer doctors 
soon began treating children with colds, ear infections, lice and chicken pox. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Kenneth O. Williams, retired USC professor and children's cancer 
specialist, helped set up the tiny operation in the early 1960s. These days, 
he's been working as the volunteer medical director of the clinic, which 
survives on a $150,000 budget fueled by donations and grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams arrived at St. John's about 5 p.m. last Tuesday and locked up his 
1989 Toyota Tercel near a street sign that warned: "Park at Your Own Risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 68, opened the clinic's iron security door and walked into a packed 
lobby. It would take him several hours to see the 10 children who waited for 
his services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to the Third World and South America in 1963," Williams said. "I was a 
little naive. I thought there was only tremendous health need in those 
underdeveloped countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came back to Los Angeles, I realized there was a similar need in our 
country. I decided to get involved here." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday evening, the ailments of the youngsters were typical: One girl had 
ringworm, a boy had a rash from wetting the bed, one baby had a cold, the rest 
of the youngsters needed routine checkups and shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the children appeared healthy, several were thin. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just don't eat right," one mother told Williams. "I don't know what to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams explained the importance of making sure the children get a balanced 
diet. After the woman left, he shook his head in dismay. 
</P>
<P>
 "She works in a sewing factory making $600 a month," Williams said. "You 
divide that by five people, there's not that much left over. I hate to think of 
what they are paying for their little apartment." 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic rarely sees children whose parents earn more than $800 a month. Six 
hundred dollars is the average. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the parents are recent immigrants from Mexico and Central America; 
others are struggling students or just down on their luck. Most of the families 
find out about the clinic from a friend or relative. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past few years, the number of patients has more than doubled, 
partially because the clinic has made an effort to open more often, usually 
Tuesday and Thursday evenings and Saturday mornings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the richest countries in the world and I think that at least 
we should be able to provide health care for our children," said Executive 
Director Jim Mangia, one of four paid staff members. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we weren't here, many, many children would go unimmunized. That impacts 
the whole community, whether you live in South-Central or Beverly Hills. 
Diseases do not stop at city boundaries." 
</P>
<P>
 Mangia wishes the clinic could do more.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To keep down the cost of malpractice insurance, the facility treats only 
routine illnesses. Youngsters with conditions more serious than the common cold 
are often referred to larger health centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding volunteer doctors to staff the clinic also has been a problem. "If we 
had the doctors, we would open every day," Mangia said. Some physicians have 
expressed concern about venturing into the crime-plagued neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, about a dozen doctors -- whose specialties range from 
rehabilitative medicine to pediatrics -- volunteer their services once a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Shirley Fannin, director of disease control for Los Angeles County, has 
worked at St. John's for 18 years. She sees the clinic as a welcome break from 
her county administrative job. 
</P>
<P>
 "This allows me to listen to hearts, feel tummies and talk to parents," Fannin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Luis Montes, who treats children with spinal cord injuries at a Los 
Angeles rehabilitation hospital, said he heard about the clinic two years ago 
from a colleague and decided to volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The patients themselves touch your heart in many different ways," Montes 
said. "The parents really beam up when we compliment them on how good of a job 
they are doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite their poverty, they have a sense of hope. They have a sense of 
opportunity for their children." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Saturday, Ofelia Gallegos drove from Cudahy to get shots and a 
checkup for her youngest daughter, Diana, age 17 months. 
</P>
<P>
 She found out about the clinic 15 years ago from a relative and has brought 
all five of her children there. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband is out of work," said Gallegos, sitting on a lopsided child's 
chair. "Times are tough for us. But my first priority is to make sure my kids 
are in good health. I like the care here. Plus, it's free."

STREET SMART / HENRY CHU: MAPS TO SHORTCUTS GET A SALES JOLT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1989, Richard Schwadel and Brian Roberts wrote not a novel, but a novelty. 
"L.A. Shortcuts," a good-humored book full of maps and commuting tips, was 
their self-published collection of bypasses through a region synonymous with 
freeway gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon its release, the manual enjoyed a brief ride as the region's top-selling 
local guidebook. Then, as expected, sales slowed like the Santa Monica Freeway 
on a Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, until Jan. 17, when a violent sneeze by Mother Nature worsened 
congestion like nothing before, sending motorists on a desperate hunt for ways 
to avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our orders increased about tenfold right after the quake," says Schwadel with 
a note of near-disbelief in his voice. "Literally the day after the earthquake 
we got a huge order from our distributor, and it's been incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Roberts, his equally amazed co-author: "We're pushing Jacqueline Susann 
off the front shelves again." 
</P>
<P>
 Interest was so high that Schwadel, a film editor by day, was invited to 
dispense commuting advice on the aptly titled radio show, "Which Way L.A.?" 
</P>
<P>
 With him was David (Dr. Roadmap) Rizzo, author of "Freeway Alternates," a 
similar handy-dandy guide to shortcuts around Southern California. Like 
Schwadel and Roberts, Rizzo logged an instant post-quake jump in demand for his 
book, as people clamored to unlock the secrets of back-door streets that Rizzo, 
a native Angeleno, has known "from birth." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it didn't hurt that retailers, smelling quick cash, yanked copies 
of "L.A. Shortcuts" and "Freeway Alternates" from local-interest shelves in the 
back of the store, propping them up on stands in their windows and on their 
counters. Glassy-eyed commuters whose mental health had collapsed with portions 
of the Santa Monica and Golden State freeways were easy prey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeing (the books) right there jogged their minds into thinking, 'Yeah, yeah, 
I need that,' " says Lisa McKim, an associate manager at Brentano's in Century 
City, who reports that sales of the two guides picked up significantly after 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that both the Santa Monica and Golden State freeways have been restored 
sooner than expected, the market for the books may tail off. But that doesn't 
disappoint any of the three writers, whose guides were more personal obsessions 
than commercial ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwadel and Roberts, who met while working on a television show a decade ago, 
spent four years compiling, verifying and timing the 90 routes included in 
"L.A. Shortcuts," which has sold about 30,000 copies to date. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the bypasses the co-authors stumbled onto themselves. Others they 
gleaned or wheedled from colleagues, cabbies and couriers, some of whom would 
sooner "give up their firstborn" than share their commuting secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shortcuts are almost an unwritten folklore," says Schwadel, 38. "Everybody 
has their own route to get somewhere, and each person's route is the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the book hit the stands five years ago, Roberts and Schwadel say most 
of the shortcuts remain current. An informal test recently of several proved 
successful, except that the drives routinely took a minute or two longer than 
advertised. 
</P>
<P>
 Fed up with the Hollywood Freeway gridlock into Downtown Los Angeles? Try the 
"Golden Temple" bypass (each of the shortcuts has a name), avoiding the 
Four-Level Interchange by exiting the freeway a few miles west of Downtown and 
taking Temple into the city core. 
</P>
<P>
 Need to throttle across the San Fernando Valley floor? Then get a "Kick in the 
Oxnard," along Oxnard Street from White Oak Avenue, hooking up with Victory 
Boulevard all the way down to Valley Circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Freeway Alternates," published in 1990, covers a wider swath of Southern 
California than just Los Angeles, listing 101 separate locations and directions 
on how to reach them. Many of the routes are quite complicated, involving up to 
10 turns as you zigzag your way across a single page of "The Thomas Guide." 
</P>
<P>
 Rizzo, 43, discovered his shortcuts while crisscrossing the region as a foot 
doctor making house calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent more time getting to a patient's house than treating a patient," he 
says. "I sat behind the wheel for hours and hours. It was Preparation H time." 
</P>
<P>
 A small mail-order business of selling shortcuts blossomed into writing the 
book, shooting a new video on how to avoid traffic jams and acting as a 
commuting consultant ("Dr. Roadmap") on a morning radio talk show. Now Rizzo 
has largely forsaken podiatry to work full-time in "transportation demand 
management." 
</P>
<P>
 But neither Rizzo nor Schwadel and Roberts can rely solely on book sales for 
their income, despite renewed interest in their guides since the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the question must be asked: Wouldn't runaway success for their 
manuals and the shortcuts also bring about their downfall?  
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, 36, puts it into perspective. "We've sold 30,000 books, which is just 
a drop in the bucket in terms of the number of drivers every day. If we sold a 
million copies, maybe it would make a difference."

CLAS TESTS ANGER PUPILS EVEN AS THEY SPUR THOUGHT; EDUCATION: DISPUTE CONTINUES 
OVER NEW STATE TESTS AS LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOLS ADMINISTER THEM. SOME 
PARENTS REFUSE TO LET CHILDREN PARTICIPATE; SOME STUDENTS RESENT 'PERSONAL' 
QUESTIONS IN THE TESTS. CLAS SUPPORTERS SAY THE EXAMS ARE WORKING AS THEY 
SHOULD.

 Eighth-grader Jennie Hoffman was angry. 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't like the poem she had just read about an overprotective mother who 
refused to let her son make new friends, and now the controversial CLAS test 
required Hoffman to answer about a dozen questions about it -- including some 
she thought too personal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true: When you're mad, you write more," Hoffman said during a break in 
testing at Millikan Middle School in Sherman Oaks. "But I don't think it's 
right for a test to make you mad. These aren't questions that are right and 
wrong. It's just what kids think." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics around the state use similar arguments against the California Learning 
Assessment System tests. They say the exams designed to judge writing and 
reading comprehension are more psychological than academic and invade student 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 To supporters, however, the innovative tests do exactly what they were 
designed to do: engage students in interesting and provocative reading material 
and prompt them to write passionately and with conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask students whether the tests themselves pass or fail and the responses are 
strong and visceral. 
</P>
<P>
 Some said they made up their responses to questions that asked for personal 
opinions because they feared telling the truth. Others said they resented 
having to relate a poem or short story to their own lives. Still others said 
they used generalizations rather than actual details.  
</P>
<P>
 "This was more like a survey," said Justin Canel, a Millikan 14-year-old. "A 
test is when you sit at a desk, you don't talk and you answer the questions -- 
otherwise you fail." 
</P>
<P>
 Other students said they found the untraditional form of the exam confusing. 
Unlike other exams, it encouraged them to discuss the material in groups and 
try out their thinking on classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't know whether you're supposed to impress the people who are reading 
it or say what you really felt and thought about the reading," said Michelle 
Lloren, a 10th-grader at Cleveland High School in Reseda. "I think all the 
money they spent on these tests should have been spent on buying English books 
that we could read during our classes." 
</P>
<P>
 The only way to impress the test scorers, say teachers and state education 
officials, is to write clearly and proficiently. What the students say in their 
essays is unimportant -- even hypothetical answers to questions about their 
personal life are fine since the graders won't be evaluating the content, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure kids do make up some examples -- but that's not what we're looking 
for," said Jill Wilson, a consultant with the state Department of Education. 
"We're looking for writing and all the characteristics of good writing." 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials who designed the exams said the reading sections 
were carefully selected to encourage students to write and analyze literature 
in new ways. The tests measure students against tough statewide standards based 
on a more rigorous academic curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to engage them enough so they care and they are more likely to 
discuss with energy and to write with conviction," Wilson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of Los Angeles Unified School District students faced the tests last 
week for the first time since the controversy over the contents of the CLAS 
exams erupted several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the controversy, which has sparked lawsuits across California, the 
state Department of Education allowed school districts to let parents exclude 
their children from taking the tests.  
</P>
<P>
 While the strongest opposition is in the west San Fernando Valley, parents 
from one end of the sprawling district to the other have opted to exempt their 
children from the tests. At Hale Middle School in Woodland Hills, for example, 
100 students out of 741 were excused. At South Gate Middle School, 40 students 
opted out. At some schools, such as Carson High and Gage Middle School, just 
one student chose not to take the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither district nor state officials are keeping track of the numbers of 
parents refusing to allow their children to take the test. Los Angeles school 
principals were told last week to compile lists of exempted students and to 
keep files of letters from parents. 
</P>
<P>
 During more than a week of testing, students at Millikan complained about the 
subjective -- sometimes personal -- questions without clear-cut answers. The 
reading and writing prompted the students to analyze literature in ways they've 
rarely done before and to use short answers, diagrams and essays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had one question asking if I had regrets about something," said Devin 
Johnson, a Millikan 14-year-old. "I was thinking for a long time. It was a real 
personal question. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone I know made up the answer," she said, drawing a round of laughter 
from classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 The critics, who range from conservative religious groups to individual 
parents leery of performance-based tests, say students should not be given 
open-ended writing assignments without clear-cut, multiple-choice questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's controversy over whether this is a psychological test or an academic 
test," said Chris Trujillo, a North Hollywood parent who demanded that her 
fourth- and eighth-grade children be exempted from the tests. "It's all been so 
secretive. Teachers aren't allowed to speak about it. I just didn't want my 
children exposed to it." 
</P>
<P>
 State officials have denied that the exams -- mandated by the Legislature as 
part of a years-long effort to improve public schools -- are psychological 
tests, and they refuse to allow parents to review them prior to the end of the 
year. In June, however, the state Board of Education has agreed to release at 
least portions of the current tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Some educators are concerned that the reading selections -- which include 
excerpts of Richard Wright's "Black Boy," among others -- are too difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some (students) could be lost at the very first sentence," said Cleveland 
High English teacher Nancy Johnston. "Some of our 10th-graders are just 
incapable of reading this without assistance." 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring is done by teams of teachers who read the tests, discuss answers and 
decide on numerical scores based on standards used statewide. Scorers of the 
writing tests are told to judge whether students can write in a convincing and 
coherent way, drawing from the reading selections. 
</P>
<P>
 But tell that to the students. "One question asked what kind of problems 
teen-agers have with their parents," said Nikki Addis, a Millikan 14-year-old. 
"This has nothing to do with English. That's personal." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Angel Salais, a Millikan classmate: "That's not a problem in my house. I 
talk to my parents all the time. I didn't know what to write . . . and I don't 
feel like telling anyone about my family."

MEDICAL PRODIGY HAS PRODIGIOUS PLANS; SCIENCE: A 12-YEAR-OLD, WHO IS ABOUT TO 
GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE, HOPES TO MAKE A BREAKTHROUGH IN FIGHT AGAINST 
PARKINSON'S DISEASE. HE HAS LEARNED TO TAKE HIS 200-PLUS IQ IN STRIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The boy genius sat in the folding chair at Griffith Park on Sunday afternoon, 
waiting to take the stage after the Imitation Elvis finished crooning. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's feet barely reached the ground and, for all anyone knew at this 
walkathon to benefit Parkinson's disease research, he was just another 
12-year-old in the crowd. Perhaps a bit overdressed in his blue shirt and tie, 
but just another boy nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Masoud Karkehadadi was ushered onstage. The adults towered over this 
diminutive figure who calmly took the microphone and delivered his speech 
without benefit of notes. 
</P>
<P>
 He talked of discovering his "extra gift," a mind that surpassed almost all 
others. He said he started thinking about the mind, trying to make some sense 
out of what makes it work and what makes it stop. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, he said, he had started thinking of an "honorable way to donate" his 
gift, which, in turn, became a factor in turning his attention to Parkinson's 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is not usually the stuff of 12-year-old talk, but this was Masoud 
Karkehadadi, the remarkable man-child, the soon-to-be June graduate of UC 
Irvine. This is the talk of someone who thinks he may have found a clue in his 
lab work into the mystery of Parkinson's, a deadly degenerative disease of the 
brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, too, there is Masoud the boy, the one who likes to play baseball and 
street hockey and computer games with the neighborhood kids and his younger 
brother, Ahmad. This is the boy who gave a chemistry demonstration during a 
visit to an elementary school, then went out with the children to the 
playground. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are around him a lot, one thing you notice is that he is just a 
kid," said his Iranian immigrant father, Mahmoud, an auto broker known around 
the Cerritos Toyota dealership as Mike K. for obvious reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be so, but there are few small boys who can talk, as he does, about 
implanting a miniature pump in the brain of a rat last year and discovering 
quite by accident a process that seems to produce dopamine cells, which are 
lost to Parkinson's disease as it makes its destructive way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had some promising results," he told about 200 walkathoners in his 
short speech. 
</P>
<P>
 To risk the obvious, this is the real Doogie Howser.  
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Masoud and his parents have come to take this genius in 
stride, to cope with the fact that, with an IQ of 200-plus, he will never have 
a life that follows the normal path of those less endowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Having begun speaking when he was 8 months old, Masoud started listening to 
and memorizing the top tunes on MTV less than a year later. He began writing 
simple sentences by the time he was 2 and got his first computer the same year. 
Almost from the beginning, he could watch a cartoon and recite it back word for 
word, sound effects included. It took a few viewings, though, for him to get 
down all the words to Walt Disney's "Peter Pan." 
</P>
<P>
 When he approached school age, he was turned down for admission by a number of 
private institutions because he was simply too advanced. Instead, his parents 
hired home tutors who helped him barrel through high school requirements by the 
time he was 7. When he took the high school equivalency exam, he scored 100%. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, his father, thinking him too young, made Masoud stay home for 
two more years, until he was 9, before allowing him to enroll at Mt. San 
Antonio College in Walnut. That college experience was not a pleasant one, 
punctuated by teasing from other, much older students and their perception that 
he was bent on rubbing in his intelligence. What he did was try to answer every 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacqueline Holden, Masoud's governess from the time he began attending 
college, said her ward was not trying to show off in class. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had never been to school before," she said. "He was just so excited to be 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 From there came a transfer to Orange Coast College, when the family moved to 
Laguna Hills in Orange County. Then came UCI, where this semester he is taking 
a course load that includes psycho-biology, molecular biology, physics, physics 
lab and a writing class. 
</P>
<P>
 For his parents, having a brilliant son has certainly had its strains. At one 
point they had to struggle through a period of financial difficulties because 
of a pre-teen college student in the house. The expenses included the 
governess, who accompanies Masoud to all his classes, her car and an apartment 
near campus for the two of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Masoud now is back living at the family home in Laguna Hills, though the 
governess still accompanies him to class each day. That will change when he 
goes off to medical school. 
</P>
<P>
 As for med school, Masoud has applied to a number of places -- the University 
of California schools plus Harvard, Yale, Johns Hopkins and others. But he is 
leaning toward staying put at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I'm going to make a huge discovery, so I want to stay here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And his father worries about the trials of having a son who may be a doctor of 
medicine by the time he is, say, 15. But there also is great joy in having such 
a boy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we thank God," said Karkehadadi. "We consider him to be God's 
blessing."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; STATE TO RECOGNIZE 21 PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty-one Orange County public schools that work hard to help their students 
succeed will be honored this week by the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 The Distinguished Schools Program will honor the schools Friday in a ceremony 
in the city of Santa Clara, said William D. Dawson, acting state superintendent 
of public instruction. They are among 180 secondary schools chosen from the 
more than 350 schools throughout the state that applied for the award. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools were selected after a review of their programs and a visit to each 
school, said Carol Kennedy, a state coordinator of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Four schools in the Fullerton Joint Union High School District were chosen -- 
the largest number from any county school district. Three schools each were 
chosen from the Santa Ana Unified and Saddleback Valley Unified school 
districts. The rest of the schools were from other districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Student test scores were considered during the selection process, but schools 
also had to demonstrate good teaching methods and curriculum, Kennedy said. The 
schools also won points for parent involvement and partnerships with business 
and industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The quality of vocational instruction and programs to keep students from 
dropping out of school were also considered, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy said state education officials believe in evaluating schools on more 
than just academic performance. "A school can do real well on paper and still 
not be looking after the needs of all its kids," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each school that applied for the award was also evaluated during a visit by an 
educator from another district or county, Kennedy said, in order to verify the 
information given in the application. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning schools were Ball Junior High, Capistrano Valley High, La Habra 
High, Sonora High, Sunny Hills High, Troy High, Huntington Beach High, Venado 
Middle, Imperial Middle, Los Alamitos High, Cerro Villa Middle, Santiago Middle 
and Bernardo Yorba Middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Other winning schools were El Toro High, Los Alisos Intermediate, Mission 
Viejo High, Carr Intermediate, Century High, Sierra Intermediate, A.G. Currie 
Middle and Foothill High. 
</P>
<P>
 Four county elementary schools were also selected as nominees for the federal 
National Blue Ribbon Schools Program to recognize good elementary schools. The 
grade schools are Barcelona Hills, Fred L. Newhart Jr., Laguna Road and Bryant 
Ranch.WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; 2 FORUMS ON RECALL ISSUES SCHEDULED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The hot topic for voters in the city is the June 7 recall election, the 
first-ever in the city's history, with the mayor, two council members and the 
city clerk facing ouster. 
</P>
<P>
 The League of Women Voters of North Orange County is having two forums on the 
issues in the recall, and the public is invited to attend and ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The first forum will be Wednesday at Troy High School, 2200 E. Dorothy Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Another will be May 31 at Sunny Hills High School, 1801 Warburton Way. Both 
will begin at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 At the forums, speaking in favor of the recall of Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin, 
City Clerk Anne M. York and council members Molly McClanahan and Don Bankhead 
will be Fullerton Recalls Committee co-chairman Thomas S. Babcock and treasurer 
Bruce Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
 McClanahan and former Mayor Dick Ackerman will speak against the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall effort began last July when the City Council voted 3 to 2 in favor 
of an unpopular 2% tax on water, telephone, electricity, natural gas and cable 
television bills, despite objections from hundreds of residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Catlin, McClanahan and Bankhead voted for the tax. Council members Julie Sa 
and Chris Norby voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
 York became a recall target when she allegedly delayed the recall process by 
rejecting petitions against the three council members, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These forums will help people decide whether they want any or all the (four 
officials) to be recalled," said Marian Schain, a league spokeswoman. "This is 
really a pretty big issue in Fullerton." MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; NEW PRINCIPAL NOT NEW TO TUSTIN HIGH

<P>
 Bob Boies, the principal of Columbus Tustin Middle School, has been appointed 
principal of Tustin High School. He will replace Duffy Clark, who will become 
principal of Mission Viejo High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees of the Tustin Unified School District approved his appointment 
earlier this month. Boies, 52, will assume his new post on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials said that a new principal at Columbus Tustin 
probably would be named by July. Applicants will be interviewed next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always considered Tustin High School my home," said Boies, who taught 
history and social science at the school from 1978 until 1986. "It's a great 
high school and I'm excited to be back." 
</P>
<P>
 From 1987 to 1990, Boies was the school's activities director and assistant 
principal in charge of instruction, discipline and student services. 
</P>
<P>
 Boies started with the district as a fifth-grade intern teacher in 1964. He 
also taught at Columbus Tustin, A.G. Currie and Utt middle schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, he was appointed principal of Columbus Tustin, where he 
succeeded in getting a state grant that paid for computers, video equipment, 
laser discs and other high-tech equipment for the school. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the $100,000-a-year grant, Columbus Tustin was designated as a 
demonstration school in the state's technology-in-education program. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers from across the state learn during the summer how to use computers as 
teaching tools. 
</P>
<P>
 Boies has also formed partnerships with local businesses, including Dimension 
Cable, the local cable television company, which allows students to use its 
equipment to film school board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Columbus Tustin was selected as an outstanding school by the 
California League of Middle Schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Boies and his wife, Barbara, a teacher at A.G. Currie, live in Irvine. BERT

 Chapman University's senior class will present the university with an 
eight-foot bronze statue of a panther -- the school mascot -- on Tuesday, in 
preparation for the return of football to the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors raised almost $8,000 for the sculpture, which depicts a panther 
prepared to strike, Chapman spokeswoman Ruth Wardwell said.It is the most 
expensive gift given by any senior class at Chapman, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman's panther will usher in the much-anticipated upcoming football season, 
Wardwell said. The university has not fielded a football team for 62 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors hope the sculpture will spark new traditions, Wardwell said, such as 
football players touching the panther for good luck before their games. 
</P>
<P>
 The statue, designed by Colorado artist Rosetta, will be unveiled at noon at 
the north end of the Argyros Forum patio, next to the athletics field. ALICIA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; DISTRICT MAY ALTER WEAPONS BAN POLICY

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fountain Valley School District is considering changing its weapons ban 
policy to eliminate ambiguity about the definition of a knife and to give 
principals discretion in deciding when to recommend expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Trustees President Robert Sedlak has pushed for the changes because 
he believes the current mandatory expulsion recommendation isn't fair to 
students. The changes will result in a more "human policy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're going to treat innocent situations differently," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sedlak said, for example, that if a youngster brought his Boy Scout knife to 
school by accident and did not have any intent to harm someone, the principal 
would have the discretion not to recommend expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal could instead choose to file a report about the student to the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the other change, the code would bar any weapon on campus rather than 
forbidding knives as defined in the state penal code. That code defines a knife 
as having a 3 1/2-inch blade. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the altered code, carrying any type of knife to school may be grounds 
for expulsion by the district's board of trustees, said Supt. Ruben L. Ingram. 
The change would eliminate confusion as to what types and sizes of knives would 
be an expellable offense, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees also will consider requiring that when two or more students are 
involved in the same incident, they would be expelled from their current 
schools and relocated at separate campuses, if possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees are expected to give final approval to the changes at Thursday's 
board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials and principals said the changes strengthen the 
zero-tolerance policy. Ingram said that if a child brings a weapon to school, 
then the principal is obligated to suspend the student, pending expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Moiola School Principal Edward Powell also said that the proposed changes 
won't weaken the zero-tolerance policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The principals are not going to start to be easy on kids who are creating a 
problem," Powell said. "I still believe the board will end up with a strong 
zero-tolerance policy." DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; ALTERNATIVES OFFERED TO WATER RATE HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents last week criticized a proposed 6% water rate hike that city 
officials are considering to cover maintenance and operating costs for the 
Water Department. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting of the Fullerton Energy and Resource Management Committee, 
residents asked members to consider alternatives to raising the water rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggestions included a water conservation program with fines for those who use 
excessive water, a water recycling program and implementation of a voluntary 
conservation effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed water fee increase is needed because the cost of getting water 
and maintaining the water system has gone up, while people have been using less 
water, said Bob Hodson, director of engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 The result has been less revenue, because water bills are based on usage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see that raising rates is ever going to solve our problem and we've 
got to look for some other ways" to raise revenue, said resident Bob Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee will hold another meeting at 7:30 p.m. June 15 at City Hall to 
discuss the city's proposal to raise the rates and hear residents' other 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The public is encouraged to attend the session. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee will make recommendations to the City Council, which will decide 
sometime in July whether to raise the rates. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; CHORALE TO PERFORM AT CARNEGIE HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It took more than practice to land Jerry Coleman and 41 other Irvine Valley 
College singers a performance this weekend at Carnegie Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 It also took some luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman, a 52-year-old Laguna Niguel insurance agent who has been singing for 
fun since childhood, decided on a whim to join the college's chorale soon after 
moving to the area two years ago. A few months after he joined, the group was 
offered a gig at the famed New York City concert hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea this would happen. It just came up," said Coleman. "What a 
wonderful opportunity. How many people get to do this once in their lifetime?" 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the college chorale and women's chorus credited their conductor, 
music professor Janice Wyma, with making Saturday's performance possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyma, who performed earlier this year at Carnegie Hall, is well-known among 
musicians and music educators. Concert organizers approached her more than a 
year ago about having the college's group perform in New York. They will join 
about 100 amateur singers from around the country to perform John Rutter's 
"Requiem." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a famous place. In addition, it is a fabulous place to sing," Wyma 
said. "It's a beautiful concert hall, one of the finest anywhere. It's a stage 
where the greatest musicians have performed." 
</P>
<P>
 Wyma and concert participants stressed that the old adage -- practice makes 
perfect -- still holds true: They have been practicing regularly for the 
concert since February. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 42 participants will pay about $1,000 each for the trip. Through a 
series of fund-raisers, the group raised $5,000 for members who could not 
afford to pay the full price of the journey. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyma said that one of the most "musically rewarding" parts of the experience 
will be rehearsing with composer John Rutter, who is best known for his 
Christmas carol arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will be ready for rehearsals," Wyma said of the group. "Then, Rutter 
will polish" their performance. 
</P>
<P>
 For Coleman, the days leading up to the trip have been filled with a mixture 
of anxiety and excitement. "I can't wait," he said. "I've always liked music. I 
like the sound." 
</P>
<P>
 The Carnegie-bound group includes all ages. "We have everyone from high school 
students to senior citizens," Wyma. "It represents the best of the community 
college (tradition) because this is a very inclusive group." SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; SALE OF BEER ALONG PARADE ROUTE BANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite protests of the sponsoring charitable organization, the City Council 
has banned beer sales along the city's Fourth of July Parade route. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 3 to 1 last week to deny the Huntington Beach Host Lions 
Club the right to sell beer on the holiday, as it has in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jim Silva cast the lone opposing vote, saying he thought the 
council's action is unfair to the Lions Club and came too late to allow time to 
plan alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't see punishing the Lions Club, especially at this late date," Silva 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions Club uses proceeds to benefit the vision impaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the charitable nature of the event, the majority noted that both the 
city staff and the Downtown Residents Assn. have urged a ban on the outdoor 
beer sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the greatest respect for the Lions Club and what they do" to help the 
vision-impaired, said Councilman David Sullivan, but the fact is, "they are 
serving beer, and if somebody has enough beer, it causes problems. . . . I have 
to come down on the side of caution." 
</P>
<P>
 The council majority noted that last July 4, Huntington Beach saw disturbances 
from rowdy young people, many of whom were intoxicated. The Downtown Residents 
Assn. had requested the ban on outdoor sales of beer to help prevent similar 
disturbances this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Whaling, president of the Lions Club, protested that the club's outdoor 
beer booths have not been the source of the problems. Club members strictly 
enforced age limits and consumption amounts, he said, adding that it is private 
parties in the downtown area that are source of rowdiness related to drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg agreed, saying Lions' beer booths have not 
caused the police any problems in previous years.BILL BILLITER

L.A. SCENE / THE CITY THEN AND NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CECILIA RASMUSSEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was one of the first architectural jewels in the publishing crown of 
America's most flamboyant press lord, William Randolph Hearst. And although it 
sits abandoned today, it once was home to one of Hearst's journalistic 
triumphs.  
</P>
<P>
 For 86 years, the modified Mission Revival-style headquarters at 11th Street 
and Broadway housed the Los Angeles Examiner (and later the Herald Examiner), 
one of half a dozen or more newspapers that heralded the daily comings and 
goings of a burgeoning Los Angeles. It served up a brew of news, political 
insight, scandal and gossip. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, it was a focal point not only of Hearst's empire, but also in the 
careers of a number of fascinating women. 
</P>
<P>
 The building brought such delight to its owner that Hearst decided to entrust 
the construction of his legendary castle in San Simeon to its architect, a 
woman in a profession then dominated by men. 
</P>
<P>
 Julia Morgan, a tiny woman with horn-rimmed glasses, was ideally suited to the 
task. A perfectionist with a passion for quality detail, she designed more than 
700 buildings in a career that covered over half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The architectural scholar and Hearst were one of the era's truly odd couples. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chief -- as Hearst was known to all -- started wars and built castles, 
wooed and won San Francisco, then set his sights on Los Angeles. In 1903, the 
Examiner (Hearst's seventh paper) was founded at 5th Street and Broadway.  
</P>
<P>
 The arrival of the gangly, personally shy publisher marked Los Angeles as an 
emerging city and national force. In 1913, Hearst decided he wanted a new home 
for his Los Angeles acquisition. He insisted that it be the best-equipped and 
largest structure in the world devoted exclusively to the production of a 
newspaper.  
</P>
<P>
 Morgan offered him a hand-painted, tiled lobby of gold and marble and a 
private apartment upstairs for his personal use. The block-long structure on a 
half-acre was set off with colorful domes at each corner. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1917, Hearst met the second woman whose life would be inextricably linked 
to the Examiner building. During a trip to New York, Hearst bought two seats at 
the Ziegfeld Follies, one for him and one for his hat. It was there, legend has 
it, that he fell in love with young, fun-loving Marion Davies, the future 
mistress of his castle.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 W.A. Swanberg, author of "Citizen Hearst," wrote that although "Hearst was not 
oblivious to her beauty, he was smitten with her bubbling vitality, her 
appreciation of the ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Davies called him "Pops" and, in her uninhibited way, would tousle his hair 
and fling affectionate insults at him, which amused him greatly. 
</P>
<P>
 Davies wanted to be an actress, and Hearst was a man who made things happen. 
He founded a movie studio to keep her working and ordered all his newspapers to 
give her rave reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Show business columnist Louella Parsons, like Morgan, began her long career in 
a field dominated by men. She was initially hired by Hearst to promote the 
movies of Davies and ended up wielding immense power. Nobody was allowed to 
change a word of her copy.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1922, Hearst bought the afternoon Herald (founded in 1876), and in 1931, he 
bought the Express (founded in 1871). 
</P>
<P>
 Those were wild days, and no one epitomized Hearst's papers better than 
reporter and later Herald-Express City Editor Agness Underwood. 
</P>
<P>
 She was a mother of two and wanted extra spending money. So Underwood became a 
telephone operator at a newspaper. She went on to become a celebrated crime 
reporter and then the crime-oriented city editor of the Herald. Crime, after 
all, was what sold newspapers, along with sex and skulduggery. She retired from 
the Herald Examiner as assistant managing editor in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chief died in 1951, at age 88, in Marion Davies' Beverly Hills home. She 
had remained loving and loyal for more than three decades -- even though 
Millicent Willson, Hearst's wife since 1903 and the mother of their five sons, 
had refused to divorce him. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, Hollywood buzzed with rumors that the liaison between Hearst and 
Davis had produced a child. The stories never were confirmed, but in 1993 the 
death announcement of 73-year-old Patricia Van Cleve Lake described her as "the 
only daughter of famed movie star Marion Davies and famed (publisher) William 
Randolph Hearst." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1962, the Examiner merged with the Los Angeles Herald. Five years later, on 
Dec. 15, 1967, employees at the Herald Examiner went on strike. By the time the 
strike ended 10 years later, one non-union printer had died from a gunshot 
wound and the Herald's circulation had dropped to 330,000. The strike changed 
the paper, its standing, the people who continued to work there and just about 
everything else. In 1989, it ceased publication. 
</P>
<P>
 Julia Morgan's building, which was added to the city's list of historic 
cultural monuments in 1977, has been vacant since then. Today, it is used 
occasionally by an itinerant movie crew, but few of their films have leading 
ladies quite as compelling as the women who once trod the corridors of the 
Herald Examiner. CECILIA RASMUSSEN

<P>
 The city's highest honor for volunteers has been awarded to a husband-wife 
team whose dedication to the town's children led them to help establish a 
much-needed volunteer crossing-guard program. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week honored John and Martha Diaz with the John R. 
Williams Public Service Award, given annually to residents who epitomize the 
spirit of community service. 
</P>
<P>
 Their efforts include developing educational programs for Latino parents, 
increasing parental involvement by about 300% in a local Parent-Teacher Assn. 
and raising funds for youth activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal has been to help Hispanic people participate in the schools," John 
Diaz said. "We want the Anglo and Hispanic community to keep together, to 
participate equally." 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife are co-presidents of the San Juan Elementary School PTA, 
members of the San Juan Community Task Force and initiators of the "Noche de 
Padres," an outreach program to address the educational needs of Latino 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 The Diazes, who have three children and own and operate an upholstery shop in 
San Juan Capistrano, are also instrumental in organizing the city's Cinco de 
Mayo celebration, collecting food and clothing for the poor, and setting up a 
catechism class at Mission San Juan Capistrano. They have lived in the city for 
15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The city received 22 letters in support of the couple's nomination for the 
award.ANDREW LePAGE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; BUSINESS TASK FORCE, AD CAMPAIGN OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved two pro-business programs, one to make city 
government more business friendly and another to encourage residents to shop 
locally. 
</P>
<P>
 The council last week set aside $33,500 for a citywide "Shop and Dine San 
Juan" promotional campaign and called for the formation of a nine-member 
business task force. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials plan to help advertise local businesses by coordinating special 
promotional events, which may offer special savings for local residents. The 
city also plans to create a variety of publications under the slogan, "Shop and 
Dine San Juan." 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, city staff wants to use a portion of the promotional budget to 
develop a destination guide that would identify -- for residents and outsiders 
-- the city's shopping, recreational and cultural attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff also has proposed developing a business resource center at City 
Hall, where proprietors could get updated information on city demographics and 
regulations, as well as attend city-sponsored instructional workshops on topics 
such as writing a business plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The council decided last week to let the soon-to-be-established business task 
force decide exactly how the $33,500 in promotional funds should be spent. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's goal is to identify ways the city can lure and retain businesses 
in hopes of increasing its sales tax base and decreasing commercial and office 
vacancies. Task force members will also identify steps the city can take to 
improve the business climate. Two possibilities are installation of park 
benches and widening of sidewalks in commercial areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force, the first of its kind since the city's Economic Development 
Commission disbanded in 1991, will consist of two City Council members and 
seven representatives of the business community. 
</P>
<P>
 The two council members, Gil Jones and Carolyn Nash, will fill out the task 
force by choosing members from each of the following: a financial institution, 
Mission San Juan Capistrano, the Chamber of Commerce, a commercial brokerage or 
leasing firm, a retail shop, an industrial company and a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force will meet in public twice a month and disband after a year.

MAN ARRESTED AFTER FOUR-CITY CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 30-year-old motorist who police initially believed was holding a woman 
against her will was arrested after he led officers on a 40-minute chase 
through four Orange County cities, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The motorist, Luis Edward Zembrano of Fullerton and a female passenger were 
first observed near St. Gertrude Place and Flower Street in south-central Santa 
Ana."According to our officer," police Sgt. John Follo said, "the vehicle had 
what appeared to be a man and woman arguing." 
</P>
<P>
 When the driver failed to stop his vehicle for the officers, police believed 
the woman was being held against her will, Follo said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 22-mile chase, Zembrano reached speeds of 75 m.p.h., Follo said. 
The suspect got on the Costa Mesa Freeway and led police through Santa Ana, 
Orange and Garden Grove. He was eventually stopped on Gardenaire Lane in 
Anaheim, where he was taken into custody without incident, Follo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Participating in the chase were a police helicopter and officers from Orange, 
Garden Grove, the California Highway Patrol and the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turned out that the woman was his girlfriend," Follo said. "She was later 
released." 
</P>
<P>
 Zembrano was arrested on suspicion of felony evading arrest and taken to Santa 
Ana Detention Center.

HOAG HOSPITAL ENDS BIRTH ANNOUNCEMENTS; SECURITY: CONCERNED ABOUT BABY 
STEALING, IT IS THE LAST OF THE COUNTY'S BIG MATERNITY HOSPITALS TO STOP 
PROVIDING NEWBORNS' NAMES TO NEWSPAPERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It used to be that proud parents clipped a birth announcement from the local 
newspaper and glued the treasured clipping into a baby book. But these days, 
those crinkly, yellow mementos might not be worth the risk.  
</P>
<P>
 Concerned by the threat of baby stealing, Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian 
last month became the last of the county's big maternity hospitals to end the 
practice of providing the names of newborns to local newspapers. Some hospitals 
even warn new parents who choose to alert the newspapers themselves that 
seeking the public announcements might not be wise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually this would be a happy announcement, but people have to watch what 
they say about those things these days," said Maureen Mazzatenta, Hoag Hospital 
spokeswoman. The hospital also stopped distributing "It's a Boy" and "It's a 
Girl" bumper stickers as gifts to new parents. "The hospital staff is acutely 
in tune to security concerns and abductions at other hospitals." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoag has been placing birth announcements as a courtesy since the hospital 
opened in 1952, but the staff there decided recently that heightened concern 
about crime and security supersedes the desire for newspaper souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is sad that people have to be so careful," Mazzatenta said, adding that 
the hospital has never had an abduction.  
</P>
<P>
 While most big hospitals gave up birth announcements years ago, a few still 
provide the information only with parental consent and most leave it up to 
parents to supply newspapers with the information. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty years ago that was the big deal," Dr. B.J. Snell, a director at UCI 
Medical Center's birthing center in Anaheim. "Today, infant security is a huge 
issue."  
</P>
<P>
 Yet, baby stealing is quite rare.  
</P>
<P>
 In the past 11 years, 19 babies have been abducted in California from either a 
hospital or, more commonly, the mother's home, according to statistics compiled 
by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the FBI. Earlier 
this month, an infant was snatched from a Los Angeles hospital was but 
recovered after a security camera captured the kidnaper's image on tape. 
</P>
<P>
 In only four cases in the past 10 years did abductors use published 
announcements to target victims, according to the national statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not an epidemic," said Ruben Rodriguez, senior analyst at the National 
Center for Missing and Exploited Children. "But try telling that to a parent 
who has had their child abducted. . . . And hospitals have gotten burned" in 
lawsuits that found them liable for having published infants' names in the 
first place, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Cathy Fitzpatrick of Lake Forest gave birth to her daughter last July at 
Hoag Hospital, she and her husband kept that day's newspaper as a souvenir but 
never got around to clipping the actual birth notice from the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sent out my own personal birth announcements to people I know," Fitzpatrick 
said. "It really doesn't surprise me (that Hoag stopped having announcements 
published); there really are people out there who are wacky. . . . It is sad 
that you have to remain so paranoid."  
</P>
<P>
 At a few hospitals countywide, the tradition lives on. Placentia Linda 
Community Hospital in Placentia sends the information to the local newspaper, 
but only with the parents' consent, said Catherine McMiller, director of 
medical records. Samaritan Medical Center in San Clemente and Fountain Valley 
Regional Hospital and Medical Center routinely provide a short notice for the 
community newspaper.  
</P>
<P>
 One community newspaper, the Irvine World News, said it receives three to 15 
announcements a week. Reporter Peggy Goetz said that even before Hoag Hospital 
stopped sending a monthly list of births, she and editors at the newspaper 
discussed the risks of printing notices that contain the baby's name and sex, 
birth date and the parents' names and home city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We checked with the hospitals to make sure they had permission from parents," 
she said. "We still get cards from parents who send their own in. . . . There 
are still people who really want those (announcements) in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Hospitals, in deference to patients' privacy, generally provide a package of 
information to parents that includes both an announcement card for the 
newspaper -- and a warning. The warning might include a recommendation that 
parents shy away from publishing birth announcements or hanging signs on front 
doors advertising the arrival of a baby.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think some of (the mothers) are still excited to see their new baby's name 
in the paper," said Jennifer Lefebvre, spokeswoman at Saddleback Memorial 
Medical Center in Laguna Hills. "But I do know that with an increase in concern 
over child safety, a lot of people have opted" not to send the newspapers the 
announcement cards.

PANORAMA CITY BOY DIES AFTER HIT-RUN ACCIDENT; CRIME: IT IS THE FOURTH SUCH 
FATALITY IN FIVE DAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A 7-year-old Panorama City boy was struck and killed Sunday by a hit-and-run 
driver as he and his sister bolted across the street to reach an ice cream 
truck, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the county's third fatal hit-and-run accident involving children in 
five days. One crash claimed two lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Skyy Nelson was hit by a black 1982 Volkswagen Rabbit as he ran across the 
street behind his 4-year-old sister on Tobias Avenue at 10:25 a.m., said Los 
Angeles Police Officer Frank Zdroy. 
</P>
<P>
 Skyy ran into the street from between parked cars, police said. Witnesses told 
police that the driver of the car didn't stop despite the loud sound when the 
child was hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The car never slowed or stopped," said a 40-year-old man who saw the 
accident, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses estimated the car was traveling at least 40 m.p.h. The impact 
knocked the victim from his shoes and threw him about 25 feet, witnesses said. 
The boy was put on life-support systems at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission 
Hills, but he died at 4:15 p.m., said a nursing supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said drivers frequently speed along the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived here for six or seven months and I've seen at least six accidents 
where no one even bothers to get out of their cars and exchange names," said 
Ronda Anderson, who lives across the street from the accident site. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, a 7-year-old girl died and her 11-year-old brother was seriously 
injured after a car struck them on the sidewalk in the Westlake district west 
of Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, 12-year-old Amalia Godoy and her mother, Maria, 48, were killed as 
they crossed a Pacoima intersection where neighbors have tried for more than 
two years to get the city to install a traffic light. A suspect turned himself 
in to police about four hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were still searching Sunday night for the driver who struck Skyy. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California leads the nation in hit-and-run accidents. Last year, half 
of the 51,627 surface-street accidents reported to the LAPD Los Angeles Police 
Department were hit-and-runs.

HAITI POOR GET POORER IN EMBARGO; CARIBBEAN: STIFFER U.N. SANCTIONS TAKE 
EFFECT. SOME U.S. OFFICIALS FEAR THEY WILL ONLY ADD TO THE MISERY OF THE 
COUNTRY'S 7 MILLION IMPOVERISHED PEOPLE.

 Meet Bobouson Myrtil. He's 18 months old, about two feet tall, weighs perhaps 
25 pounds, has enormous, entrancing dark eyes and, his mother says, "is going 
to die." 
</P>
<P>
 Bobouson doesn't know why he chokes on mucus and goes to sleep each night 
crying from hunger or that his life is likely to get worse, and neither does 
his mother, Emilia Myrtil, a 35-year-old with three other children so 
malnourished and ill that, she says in a flat voice, "they will all die." 
</P>
<P>
 But other people in this hamlet in the poorest area of the poorest country in 
the Western Hemisphere do. It's the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 The newest and bluntest stage of a series of embargoes dating back to 
November, 1991, went into effect Sunday, a theoretically near-total cutoff of 
all trade and commerce that is supposed to force the army dictators and their 
civilian allies to surrender and allow the return of the man brutally ousted 
from power 2 1/2 years ago, exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the failure of the past sanctions, most experts, including U.S. 
officials in Haiti and Washington, privately doubt that this newest tightening 
of the screws will accomplish anything other than increasing the already 
palpable misery of the overwhelming majority of Haiti's impoverished 7 million 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know about a new embargo and I don't know where the embargo comes 
from," said Aramis Ramilien, a 32-year-old woman who runs an emergency feeding 
center near La Vie. "It just falls on us." 
</P>
<P>
 The northwest of Haiti is a place to understand the real effect of the past 
sanctions and to judge the impact of the current round. 
</P>
<P>
 Connected to the capital of Port-au-Prince by a road passable only by powerful 
four-wheel-drive vehicles that still take at least nine hours to make the 
spine-wrecking drive, the northwest is home to the poorest of the Haitian poor. 
</P>
<P>
 The area's only town, Bombardopolis, has not had electricity for nearly five 
years since a generator donated by the Germans failed. Rain that began last 
week interrupted a six-year drought, but, as with many things in Haiti, this 
blessing came wrapped in curses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have rain, yes," said a relief worker with a private French development 
organization, "but the roads are flooded and the trucks (distributing food to 
feeding centers) can't get through, and the cooks can't find dry wood to cook 
with." 
</P>
<P>
 So on Saturday, many of the emergency food centers couldn't open. And since 
the centers close on Sundays anyway, most of the 320,000 northwestern residents 
who get their only daily meal from them won't eat for at least two days. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not the whole of it. An additional 300,000 people depend on so-called 
dry feeding -- allotments of flour and uncooked beans distributed to people who 
live too far or are too sick to walk to the feeding centers. With the roads 
impassable lanes of muck, these people also went hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 Bombardopolis' poverty has been ever thus, and the rains come so infrequently 
that it is more desert than drought-ridden, but residents and international 
relief workers say the embargoes of the last 2 1/2 years have left these people 
clinging by their fingertips to the last rung of the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the embargo authorized by the U.N. Security Council at the urging of the 
Clinton Administration has all but guaranteed that the inhabitants of the 
northwest will fall to the bottom of the barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanctions do have some exceptions, medicine and food among them. But 
officials of the two largest humanitarian agencies in Haiti, CARE and Catholic 
Relief Services, say their already severe distribution problems will worsen 
considerably. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting at the source, the rules of the embargo require hard-to-get licenses 
for humanitarian shipments by sea to Haiti and limit air connections to 
scheduled passenger lines, which, in turn, restrict cargo to two suitcases a 
person. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two U.S. charitable groups report having flights grounded by U.S. 
authorities, and other organizations describe difficulties in putting together 
large enough shipments to make it profitable for carriers to bring them to 
Haiti even if licenses are granted. 
</P>
<P>
 Once authorized goods arrive, the problems only multiply, and not just those 
caused by rains. There are no spare parts for trucks or for the unloading 
machinery at the ports. 
</P>
<P>
 Edinel Jean-Baptiste, a nurse at Bombardopolis' solitary clinic, said the only 
way she can get medicine to treat patients is to beg money from the 
cash-starved residents and try to find her way to Port-au-Prince, 180 miles 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there is hardly any transport," she said as she sat in her sparsely 
furnished and thatch-roofed house, "and it costs 30 (U.S.) dollars" round trip. 
(She makes less than half that in a month -- if she gets paid.) 
</P>
<P>
 Jean-Baptiste said the lack of transport and money has reduced her patients to 
about 15 a day, almost all of them suffering from hunger or malnutrition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get about four or five new cases of malnutrition every day," she said. 
"Last week there were four children with severe malnutrition, two with Grade 
Three and two with Grade Two." Grade Three malnutrition puts the children in 
danger of death, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As discouraging as the circumstances are for the northwest, the prospects are 
equally dim for achieving the stated goal of the embargo -- the return of 
Aristide, the country's first democratically elected president. 
</P>
<P>
 For not only is the military refusing to give in, the embargo itself has made 
the army and its civilian cronies rich through their control of the rampant 
smuggling that has defeated the sanctions so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the smuggled goods, including millions of gallons of gasoline, come 
from the neighboring Dominican Republic. U.S. officials say the key to a 
successful embargo is the closing of that border. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet those same officials say there is little they can do to force the 
Dominican government to act, and with profits on both sides of the border so 
high and the Santo Domingo government sympathetic to the Haitian military, 
there appears to be no chance of voluntary compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Added to this is the sour irony of a U.S. policy that exempts the most 
powerful of Haitian civilians supporting the coup from travel restrictions and 
asset-freezing as called for by the Security Council on grounds that "they may 
be of use to us" in the future, as one U.S. official put it. 
</P>
<P>
 That the sanctions remain porous was evident by the four large tanker trucks 
seen Saturday heading to the border town of Ouanamint to pick up gasoline and 
from reports from the southern port city of Jacmel, where six freighters had 
unloaded thousands of gallons of gasoline bought in the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 One ship loaded with gasoline defied repeated radio demands from a U.S. Navy 
ship that it stop or face being fired on. The ship landed and the U.S. vessel 
held its fire, according to witnesses who also monitored the radio exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 So while guests of the quaint Jacmelienne Hotel sipped their cocktails and 
watched thousands of gallons of embargo-breaking gasoline unloaded in full view 
of blustering U.S. naval officers, little Bobouson Myrtil and hundreds of 
thousands of equally deprived Haitians either ate a gruel of mixed wheat-soy 
flour thickened by bean paste or didn't eat at all.

LAX SCRUTINY FOSTERS FRAUD IN TRUST DEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If anyone were watching, the First Pension Corp. disaster might have been 
headed off as long ago as Aug. 12, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 On that day the firm's owners filed notices with a California agency claiming 
that each of 23 virtually identical real estate investment pools was exempt 
from regulation as a public securities offering because it was not to be 
offered to more than 35 sophisticated investors. 
</P>
<P>
 To any attentive regulator such a flurry of exemption claims would have 
suggested that the promoters were trying to evade the normally strict rules of 
disclosure for public securities offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one was watching. 
</P>
<P>
 The exemption notices were stamped by a department clerk and filed. No one 
from the state watchdog agency got a look at the books of promoter William E. 
Cooper or his partners. No one -- not even the president of the First Pension 
affiliate selling the pools -- ever knew what trust deeds, or mortgages, 
underlay the investment pools or even whether they existed. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, nearly seven years later, these pools are among hundreds offered by 
affiliates of First Pension into which nearly $100 million of investors' funds 
may have vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 That the filings passed unnoticed -- as did dozens of other potentially 
fraudulent offerings from companies affiliated with First Pension -- 
illustrates a gaping hole in the regulatory safety net that has contributed to 
hundreds of millions of dollars in investor losses in California real estate 
investments in the last 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 About 11,000 investors may have lost more than $450 million to mismanagement 
and fraud at three firms alone: San Diego's Pioneer Mortgage, Property Mortgage 
Co. of Sherman Oaks, and First Pension. 
</P>
<P>
 Based in Irvine, First Pension sold many of its retirement-fund clients 
questionable mortgage investments packaged by its sister companies, Vestcorp 
and First Diversified Financial Services. Investors typically were referred to 
First Pension by their accountant or stockbroker. 
</P>
<P>
 The surge of losses has refocused attention on the riskiness of these 
investments as well as the difficulty of policing the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Many attorneys and government officials familiar with the trust-deed business 
say it is notoriously prone to fraud and firmly resistant to regulation. 
Regulators say they have neither the money nor manpower to supervise the 
investments thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 State agencies require no special expertise from those who set themselves up 
as mortgage brokers. Although a real estate license is required to handle 
certain transactions, licensees need get no special training in mortgage 
lending. Moreover, promoters of trust deeds can "rent" real estate licenses by 
simply hiring licensed brokers to front for their firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulatory jurisdiction is shared by two state agencies that do not habitually 
share information with each other: The Department of Real Estate oversees 
transactions between individual borrowers and individual lenders. But if the 
trust deed is "fractionalized," or broken into pieces for sale to more than one 
investor, it comes under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 No one can expect the average investor to negotiate the resulting maze of 
jurisdictions. At least one First Pension customer was misled when he asked the 
Department of Corporations whether the firm's owners had clean histories. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 1991, the agency told one Ventura County investor that the firm, 
its affiliates and its principals had "no disciplinary records." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact the Department of Real Estate had revoked the license of Cooper, one 
of First Pension's three principals, in 1984 for misappropriating more than 
$577,000 of his clients' money. 
</P>
<P>
 The department denied his application for reinstatement twice on grounds that 
he still owed more than $100,000 to more than seven clients who claimed he had 
given them worthless promissory notes to settle legitimate debts. (Cooper 
finally did get a new license.) 
</P>
<P>
 Other investors faced a regulatory runaround. 
</P>
<P>
 When Helen G. Schroeder of Torrance wrote the Department of Corporations last 
July to complain that First Pension fraudulently kept $6,500 of a $9,500 
distribution due her, she got a form letter noting that the department gets 
16,000 investor complaints a year and "has no jurisdiction over a company's 
failure to provide a full accounting of funds." 
</P>
<P>
 To the extent that the trust deed business does come under regulation, those 
performing the oversight are overworked and underpaid. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (regulators) I've worked with are all conscientious," said Dennis 
Schmucker, a lawyer who has acted as court-appointed receiver for Pioneer 
Mortgage, American Home Mortgage and several other fraud-tainted operators in 
the business. "But there's too much for them to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Scott Metzger, a San Diego attorney who represented 900 investors in a 
lawsuit against Pioneer Mortgage: "As a practical matter there's not enough 
money in California for them to send auditors to check out all the firms they 
regulate." 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Real Estate, for example, employs 30 auditors to cover the 
entire state. "We're just busy putting out fires," said Deputy Commissioner 
John Liberator. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Corporations also lacks the resources for systematic review 
of the exemption claims filed by investment pools, although something of the 
sort might have picked up Cooper's blizzard of claims in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Under law, essentially similar offerings from a single promoter have to be 
treated as if they are all one. Thus, instead of 23 offerings to 35 customers 
each, Cooper was really making a single pitch to more than 800 customers. 
</P>
<P>
 If regulators had noticed that, they would have held the promoters to 
stringent terms, including audits, public disclosure of their financial backing 
and an accounting of exactly which properties and what kind of mortgage 
investments they were selling. The state commissioner of corporations would 
have to give his approval before the investment could be offered for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are just routine filings and we get 40,000 of them a year," said G. W. 
McDonald, the agency's regional enforcement chief. "There's no red flag system 
to pick up the violations." 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension was long a beneficiary of such cracks in the regulatory edifice, 
and not only at the state level. 
</P>
<P>
 Although as a pension administrator it was subject to auditing by the U.S. 
Department of Labor, regional officials at that agency say they did not get 
around to examining its books even once in its 14 years of existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Trust deeds entered the universe of popular California investments in 
November, 1979, when voters approved Proposition 2, lifting the usury ceiling 
of 10% on mortgage brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely a year later the business had generated its first major fraud 
investigation when the Securities and Exchange Commission charged San 
Bernardino-based Western Sierra Group with defrauding investors of as much as 
$100 million by telling them they were buying second mortgages when in fact 
they were buying thirds, fourths or fifths. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot about this business that attracts problems," said Sheldon M. 
Jaffe, who was receiver for Southern California Realty, a trust deed firm that 
went under with millions in investor funds in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Start with the borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically homeowners turn to trust deed lenders because "traditional lenders 
won't touch them," Schmucker said. The reason may be a poor credit history, a 
lost job, or concerns that the home equity being posted as collateral is not 
enough to support the mortgages already on it. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, Schmucker said, "there's not enough high-quality product to go 
around in a business where your best loan is already a questionable loan." 
</P>
<P>
 In the pattern followed by most of the failed trust deed brokerages, as 
defaults mount on their best loans -- and as new money continues to flow in 
from unwitting investors -- the promoters go trolling among ever more suspect 
borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Defaults proliferate and "then the Ponzi scheme starts," Schmucker said. To 
mask the defaults on the earlier loans they use money coming in from new 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They begin to make loans they know they shouldn't, to buy time," he said. 
"Pretty soon they're making phony loans and pretty soon they're in jail. I've 
handled four or five of these and they all fit the bill." 
</P>
<P>
 These problems naturally intensified with the crash in California property 
values of the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the real estate industry, a lot who were running an honest business just 
got killed," said Steven Gourley, a Los Angeles lawyer who was chief deputy 
commissioner of the Department of Corporations during the last great surge of 
trust deed scams, in the early 1980s. "If you were playing fast and loose from 
the beginning, this economy cut you in half." 
</P>
<P>
 It is precisely the decline in real estate that has uncovered many of the 
latest problems, the way old shipwrecks are exposed by a receding tide. "As 
long as property values went up, no one ever counted the money to see if it was 
still there," Gourley says. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, as a putative investment in real estate offering high returns -- 
some promoters have contended that they could pay their customers 20% a year or 
more -- trust deeds have attracted inattentive or incautious investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The widow Jones, left a half-million dollars by her husband, at 5% gets 
$25,000 a year. She's a prime target for someone who says he can give her 10%," 
Jaffe said. "The broker is minimizing the risk of the investment and she's 
convincing herself to believe him." 
</P>
<P>
 Many investors are especially unaware that they may need to put up more 
capital to protect their investment if the borrower defaults. 
</P>
<P>
 If a homeowner stops making payments on his first mortgage, for example, a 
foreclosure by the bank or other institution holding the first will typically 
wipe out all of the other mortgage holders -- unless they keep up the payments 
on the first long enough to foreclose themselves, a period of at least four 
months. Most small investors in trust deed pools do not have the wherewithal to 
do that. 
</P>
<P>
 But as most investment experts say, the best defense against such surprises is 
for investors to be more careful going in. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the average investor would ask the promoter for the same information he 
gives when he fills out a MasterCard application, most of these guys would just 
go away," Jaffe said. "I've seen people invest in these with less information 
than I'd use to buy a stereo."

TROOPER FACES DILEMMA AS CLINTON SUIT CO-DEFENDANT; COURTS: DENYING ALLEGATIONS 
WOULD CONTRADICT HIS PAST STORIES. CONFIRMING THEM WOULD EMBARRASS PRESIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ and WILLIAM C. REMPEL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is a hallmark of the controversies surrounding Bill Clinton that some of 
his oldest Arkansas acquaintances have caused him the most embarrassment. But 
few, if any, have been in a position to damage the President's reputation as 
much as Danny Lee Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson, a veteran Arkansas state trooper, was named recently as co-defendant 
in a lawsuit filed by Paula Corbin Jones accusing Clinton of sexual harassment. 
Jones claims that Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, arranged to have 
Ferguson, his bodyguard, bring her to a hotel room in 1991 for the purpose of 
oral sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' suit may be a source of jokes on late-night television, but it is no 
laughing matter for Ferguson. Knowing he must respond to the suit, he has hired 
a lawyer and spent many hours in anguished discussion with his wife, Sheila, 
also a trooper. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson's dilemma is this: If he affirms Jones' allegations, he will 
seriously embarrass the President and more deeply embroil himself in a growing 
national controversy. If he denies them, he will be contradicting a story he 
first told privately to friends, fellow troopers and reporters months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a Hobson's choice that Ferguson clearly would prefer to avoid. Even 
though Ferguson has sometimes toyed with the idea of becoming a national 
celebrity by going public with his tales of life as Clinton's bodyguard, a 
sense of loyalty to his former employer and fear of losing his job have kept 
him from doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview, he expressed the hope that the case would be dropped or 
thrown out of court, sparing him further action and anxiety. If that does not 
happen, he said he fears he will be forced "to tell the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 That is a prospect that, depending on Ferguson's credibility, would be fraught 
with unpredictable consequences for all involved. In prior conversations, for 
example, Ferguson has not only acknowledged elements of the Jones story but has 
described a number of other extramarital encounters involving Clinton that he 
helped to arrange or witnessed. 
</P>
<P>
 It is clear that Jones' attorneys intend to try bolstering their client's 
account by seeking to show that the conduct she describes was consistent with a 
pattern of behavior by Clinton and his bodyguards. Ferguson could hold a key to 
that line of inquiry too. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time the lanky, 41-year-old trooper has found himself in 
such a bind. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last summer, Ferguson was among a group of former Clinton bodyguards who 
began meeting with reporters for The Times and, later, the conservative 
magazine American Spectator, to discuss going public with accounts of the 
former governor's alleged sexual exploits. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he had decided whether to go on the record with his accounts, Ferguson 
says he received a series of telephone calls from the President seeking to 
"shut down" the story by persuading the troopers not to talk. During those 
telephone conversations, Ferguson said, Clinton offered him a choice of federal 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, under what his friends described as "intense pressure" from Clinton 
aides, Ferguson would say there was no "explicit" link between the job offers 
and the request for silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson said he declined the job offers. After the White House contacts, 
however, he also decided not to allow his name to be used in the early 
published accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 But anonymity is no longer an option for Ferguson. Jones' sexual-harassment 
lawsuit named him as a principal figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Under rules of the federal court in which her suit was filed, defendants have 
20 days to respond to the allegations leveled against them. Bill Bristow of 
Jonesboro, Ark., a well-respected trial lawyer whom Ferguson has hired to 
represent him, said he and his client are pondering whether to make "a general, 
rather vague response, or a detailed response." Bristow declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 As Bristow sees it, if Ferguson is called to testify in this case, he risks 
being asked not only about Jones' encounter with Clinton, but also about other 
instances in which troopers allegedly helped Clinton arrange or conceal 
extramarital affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, the White House has insisted that the alleged encounter with 
Jones never happened. It has also discounted the allegations of other sexual 
escapades made by other state troopers as the work of opportunists seeking 
financial gain from peddling lurid stories and of Clinton enemies devoted to 
fomenting rumors to destroy him. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson's options would seem limited, primarily because he has told so many 
people a story similar in some respects to the one alleged by Jones in her 
suit. In fact, it was Ferguson -- not Jones -- who first provided an account of 
the alleged May, 1991, encounter between Clinton and Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times last summer, Ferguson recalled that Clinton had 
directed him to approach a woman who was working behind the registration desk 
at a seminar of the Arkansas Industrial Development Corp. at the Excelsior 
Hotel in Little Rock. Ferguson said the governor told him that the woman had 
"that come-hither look" and that he wanted to meet her privately. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on Clinton's orders, Ferguson said, he first secured a room by telling 
the hotel manager that the governor was expecting an important call from the 
White House and needed a private room. Then he invited the woman to meet the 
governor there. 
</P>
<P>
 In her lawsuit, Jones said she was reassured by Ferguson who said: "It's OK; 
we do this all the time for the governor." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she found the governor waiting inside with the door slightly ajar. 
After some small talk, she said, Clinton pulled her close to him, praised her 
hair and "curves" and then attempted to kiss her neck. Jones said she 
protested, but the governor responded by dropping his pants and asking for oral 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said she then fled the room. As she left, she recalled that Clinton 
beseeched her: "Let's keep this between ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Jones' and Ferguson's stories agree in some details, they do not on 
one point potentially important to the legal case. Jones contends in her suit 
that she rejected the governor's advances and left without speaking to Ferguson 
in the hallway. The trooper recalls, however, that she told him as she was 
walking away "straightening her dress" that if the governor wanted her to be 
his steady girlfriend, "I'll be there any time." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones says she spent no more than 15 minutes in the room; Ferguson says it was 
about half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said she did not decide to file suit until she read the unnamed 
trooper's account of a woman identified only as "Paula" in the American 
Spectator and feared many people would know it referred to her. She said she 
acted to salvage her reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suit, Jones said she met Ferguson again by chance at a restaurant in 
North Little Rock after the American Spectator article appeared. During their 
conversation, Jones claims, Ferguson supported her version of the 1991 episode. 
</P>
<P>
 What worries Ferguson almost as much as being called to testify about the 
alleged encounter is the question of how he is going to pay his legal bills. A 
man who appears to live at the brink of his modest means, he noted during an 
interview that neither Clinton nor Jones are shouldering the full burden of 
their legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last December, Ferguson said the White House had leaned on 
him, even asking him "to lie" to Times reporters. He declined to say whether 
that request came from Clinton or others close to the President. He said he 
refused the request. "I won't lie for Bill Clinton," Ferguson said repeatedly 
during conversations with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Making matters even more uncomfortable for the trooper, he continues to serve 
as a member of current Gov. Jim Guy Tucker's security detail -- as does his 
wife. The couple wonders whether that can continue if he becomes embroiled in 
the Jones case testimony.

SAVORING A WORLD OF BEAUTY AFTER 66 YEARS IN SHADOWS; MEDICINE: NEARLY BLINDED 
AT BIRTH, MATHEMATICIAN MADE THE MOST OF PARTIAL SIGHT. SURGERY TO SAVE IT 
SURPASSES HOPES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For 66 years, Sam Genensky viewed the world through a succession of magnifying 
devices, compensating for vision so severely damaged at birth he literally 
could not see his fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Pacific Palisades mathematician lay in darkness in a hospital, his 
one functioning eye bandaged, his heart pounding with fear. 
</P>
<P>
 He had undergone a difficult operation the day before to save the sliver of 
sight in his right eye. But the surgery -- a cornea transplant -- was extremely 
risky in an eye as badly scarred as Genensky's. Would he be able to see at all 
when the bandage came off? 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Genensky wasn't sure. His brain could not immediately label the 
startling images recorded by his eye. Sunlight poured in from a window, 
splashing across the wall at the foot of his bed. He made out a chair, then the 
door to his hospital room, even the disarray of his bed linen. 
</P>
<P>
 Genensky began to cry. The surgery to save him from total blindness had done 
so much more, opening up a world of sight he had long ago stopped hoping for. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw my daughter Marcia's long flowing brown hair for the first time from a 
distance. . . . I saw my doctor's mustache. I could make out objects around the 
room. Colors were incredible!" he said in an interview five months after the 
operation at St. Johns Hospital in Santa Monica. Genensky's voice broke as he 
described that moment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the scientist in him recovered quickly: "Even though I could see colors 
before," he explained, "there was a muddy, grayish quality to them. I just 
didn't have enough acuity." 
</P>
<P>
 Genensky still falls into the category of the legally blind: 20/200 vision or 
worse. His left eye is useless and his right eye now registers only 20/400. But 
for Genensky, the operation has made a profound difference, opening up 
panoramas where before he could only see tiny magnified bits of things around 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first places Genensky went to celebrate his new view of the world 
was the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena. A devoted admirer of the Impressionist 
school of painting, he had spent decades examining them in sections through his 
binoculars, then mentally assembling the whole. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the Renoirs and the Monets like it was the first time -- the brush 
strokes, the detail, everything I had missed before! And, oh, the colors were 
so stunning," he said. "It made my day." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Genensky's eyes were severely burned at birth, when a nurse accidentally 
bathed them with a caustic chemical, mistaking the drops for silver nitrate 
solution -- then a routine treatment to guard babies against infections from 
the mother. The left eye was ruined, the right eye too scarred to be useful. 
But a Boston eye surgeon managed to create a pinhole opening at the top edge of 
the scarred cornea, admitting light to the baby's still functioning retina. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus Sam Genensky made his way through school and life, resisting social and 
institutional pressures to gracefully accept the limitations of his eyesight. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent a miserable year at the renowned Perkins School for the Blind in 
Massachusetts after the public school superintendent in his hometown of New 
Bedford refused to admit him to regular high school. Required at Perkins to 
learn Braille, he stubbornly avoided using it, collecting every bit of printed 
material he could get his hands on and reading it with his nose literally 
pressed to the page. 
</P>
<P>
 "The director called me into his office one day and said, 'Sam, why can't you 
act like a well-behaved blind child?' " Genensky recalled. To that, he replied: 
"Because I am not blind." 
</P>
<P>
 A new superintendent in New Bedford agreed to let young Sam try high school, 
but warned that there would be no concessions to his handicap in grades or the 
pace of instruction. He struggled through the first year, unable to see the 
blackboard. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second year, though, he hit on the idea of using his father's World War 
I field glasses to magnify the board. Squinting through them from a seat in the 
front row, Genensky was able to see the math equations he previously had 
understood purely from description. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used these all through New Bedford High School, through Brown (University) 
. . . and all through graduate school at Brown," Genensky recalled, holding the 
80-year-old binoculars that he keeps handy on a shelf in his office at the 
Center for the Partially Sighted in Santa Monica, which he founded in 1978 to 
help people with limited vision. 
</P>
<P>
 The center was a major career shift for Genensky. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not set out to be an advocate for the blind, nor did he even count 
himself among them, though with 20/1000 vision in his sole functioning eye, 
Genensky was well within the legal definition of sightless. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Brown with a doctorate in applied mathematics, he worked 
as a computer scientist for the U.S. Bureau of Standards, determined not to let 
his vision influence his career choices. "I was so bitter about the Perkins 
experience," he explained. "I wanted to only be among the sighted." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1958, he joined RAND Corp., working on strategic systems for the U.S. Air 
Force, among other projects. While at RAND, he and several colleagues developed 
a device based on closed-circuit television technology that enables people with 
severely limited vision to read and write. 
</P>
<P>
 Its prototype actually was built for Genensky's own use. Users place their 
writing pads or texts under the camera part of the device, which instantly 
projects an enlarged version of the work onto a video screen. Genensky also 
designed glasses with telescopic lenses -- a wearable version of the binoculars 
he carried around his neck at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Refinements of these and other seeing aids might have ended there, were it not 
for an article on the closed-circuit device in the January, 1971, issue of 
Reader's Digest. The article was titled: "Sam Genensky's Marvelous Seeing 
Machine." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were inundated with letters -- 5,000 a week," Genensky recalled. 
"Suddenly, after all those years of refusing to accept the label 'blind,' I 
found myself among people just like me" -- people who had some sight but had 
access only to services for people who couldn't see at all. "I couldn't turn my 
back on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides inventing devices to enhance vision, he was among the first 
researchers to document that most people labeled legally blind have some vision 
-- data essential to rationalizing government funding and services to this 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tail is wagging the dog in terms of funding," said Genensky, backing the 
declaration with statistics he has put to very effective use in congressional 
hearings and other forums. "About 70% of the so-called legally blind (an 
estimated 630,000 people in the United States) . . . have enough vision to be 
considered partially sighted." 
</P>
<P>
 Genensky, the mathematician, uses this sort of data expertly. But the torrent 
of statistics came to an abrupt halt one recent afternoon when Genensky 
happened to glance at a blackboard in the corner of his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Reminded of his new visual abilities, he leaped from his chair with a loud 
"Aha!" and grabbed a piece of chalk. A minute later, two big pie charts covered 
the lower half of the board, with shading in the noteworthy slices. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't do this a few months ago," he said, admiring his handiwork. 
</P>
<P>
 The transplant last November replaced Genensky's scarred cornea, giving him a 
clearer window on the world. And from the pinhole opening created by the Boston 
doctor so many years ago, Genensky's surgeon, Dr. Jeremy Levenson of Santa 
Monica, was able to fashion a pupil that resembles a cat's eye slit, admitting 
more light and dramatically enhancing Genensky's vision. 
</P>
<P>
 The eye is far from perfect. By normal standards, Dr. Genensky says his vision 
is downright "crummy." He still can't drive, has no depth perception and has 
trouble reading people's facial expressions from any distance. 
</P>
<P>
 "But for me," he added, "it's a new world."

YOU'RE WHO, AND YOU'RE RUNNING FOR WHAT?

<P>
 Quick, now: Who is the lieutenant governor of California, the Al Gore of the 
Golden State? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't take it so hard. You're not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The sad truth is that cigarette-smoking cartoon animals have more celebrity 
than the public servants who hold seven major state offices. The average voter 
could not identify them all if he were staked to an anthill. 
</P>
<P>
 And still, dozens of candidates are spending piles of cash to win their 
parties' nominations in the June 7 primary to these rather obscure posts: 
California's lieutenant governor, secretary of state, treasurer, controller, 
state schools superintendent and insurance commissioner. Both the Democratic 
and Republican candidates for attorney general are unopposed and are leaving 
that fight until November. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in memory, six of these seven statewide positions are 
vacant, up for grabs, untenanted by virtue of Proposition 140, burnout and 
ambition. 
</P>
<P>
 Should you care? Oh, yes; the holders of these jobs enforce the state's laws, 
invest its money, direct its schoolrooms, sign its checks, ride herd on its 
insurance rates, run its elections. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be one fight card worth following. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the fans will turn out is another question. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, while there may not be a lot of interest," says consultant Steve 
Glazer, who is working on Michael Woo's primary campaign to be secretary of 
state, "you just keep plugging away. And while people may not seem to care, you 
know the office means something to people's daily lives." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not the stuff that kindles political fires, but still, the contenders 
press on, campaigning in relative obscurity, outshone by the sexy clamor on 
crime and immigration at the top of the ticket in the governor's race. The 
lesser lights are overwhelmed even before they begin by this enormous, 
expensive, hard-to-reach state where even Alan Cranston, comfortably 
established with all the cachet and visibility of a United States senator, 
would spend upward of $10 million in 1986 to make sure he was reelected. 
</P>
<P>
 It's enough to tear at Ken Khachigian's heart: 
</P>
<P>
 "They come in to see me before they run, they've got all these grandiose 
plans, they have all this energy, all this money, they're running around the 
state -- and it's all playing at the margins," says Khachigian, the grand old 
campaign consultant to the Grand Old Party. This time he is advising Atty. Gen. 
Dan Lungren, the only statewide incumbent except Wilson seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very, very tough," agrees Assemblyman Stan Statham (R-Redding), facing 
state Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) in the primary race for lieutenant 
governor. He is best known for his quirky proposal to divide California into 
three states. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got off the phone with a stranger in Sunnyvale who's going to send me 
$500. But his question was, after I told him what I was trying to do, 'Who is 
your opponent?' " 
</P>
<P>
 And Statham's one of the bigger guys on this big ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Listen to a couple of smaller ones: 
</P>
<P>
 Perry L. Martin, physics teacher and parent, one of a dozen candidates for the 
nonpartisan office of superintendent of public instruction: "It's hard to get 
taken seriously. . . . There are 12 of us (running), and some of us are nuts." 
</P>
<P>
 The educationally well-credentialed Lewis S. Keizer, seeking the same office: 
"As an educator, I'm a giant. As a politician, I'm nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 "You have the voter," says Khachigian, "trying to make a somewhat intelligent 
decision based on very little information. And you have candidates hoping (in 
the case of the schools superintendent) to make a runoff. And yet all of them 
have such meager resources, it's hard to tell where to put it to hit the 
jackpot." 
</P>
<P>
 Voters in these heavily populated "down-ballot" races tend to remember the 
officeholder, not the office. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone knows Jerry Brown -- as governor, not as the secretary of state, his 
first state job. Alan Cranston -- as senator, not the state controller. March 
Fong Eu's name rings familiar for getting pay toilets banned. But she did it as 
a legislator, not as secretary of state, a job she held for 20 years until she 
quit this year to become ambassador to Micronesia. 
</P>
<P>
 A mid-April Field Poll of these races showed that even the one incumbent, 
Lungren, is familiar to only 56% of his fellow Republicans and 49% of 
Democrats. Identification scores of 12% and 15% are common for most candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those with higher favorables among Democrats than fellow Republicans is 
Wes Bannister, who four years ago polled respectable numbers in a vastly 
outspent campaign against John Garamendi when the insurance commissioner's job 
first became an elected one. 
</P>
<P>
 He's running again, but in the recent Field Poll, few of those polled from 
either party knew enough about him to offer a judgment. He thinks he's doing 
better than that, but he's doing things differently in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned my lesson the hard way last time, and this time I haven't even 
tried" raising money, Bannister says. "I'm just going around and running a 
literally hundred-percent grass-roots campaign -- no TV, no anything. 
Literally, I'm running the campaign like you build a sales force." 
</P>
<P>
 How, then, do dozens of contenders win millions of voters' attention, much 
less their hearts and minds? 
</P>
<P>
 The easiest is name ID. Voters may cast a ballot based on nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, as the Proposition 140 diaspora continues, voters may experience a 
kind of cognitive dissonance at seeing a familiar name next to an unfamiliar 
office -- former L.A. mayoral candidate Woo up for the Democratic nomination 
for secretary of state, for example. Or Assemblyman Bill Jones (R-Fresno), 
author of the "three strikes" legislation, wanting to be secretary of state. Or 
ex-Senate leader David Roberti vying for treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Voters) say, 'Oh, that name's familiar,' " says Khachigian, "and I confess 
I've done it for municipal judgeships and local obscure positions. I figure if 
I know that name, that candidate has done something right, so I'll remember 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 If the name isn't familiar, voters may then judge by what the candidate does 
for a living. What kind of signal does "environmentalist" send out? Is 
"incumbent" the kiss of death? Twelve-year Assemblyman Jones reached for a 
triple with "legislator, businessman, rancher." 
</P>
<P>
 Failing even that, voters may choose on gut instinct, or caprice: the 
candidate's gender, the sound of the name. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason those little things matter is that six primary races brawling 
across the state have registered hardly a blip on TV screens. Except for 
newspaper stories, there hasn't been much of what the pros call "free media" -- 
news coverage -- as opposed to "paid media" -- ads. 
</P>
<P>
 George Urch is campaign manager for Tom Umberg, the only Democrat that Orange 
County sends to Sacramento, and the sole Democratic candidate for attorney 
general. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to rely on a lot of free press, and when the press doesn't seem 
interested in these races, only covering the governor, it makes your life 
miserable. It's a Catch-22 -- how do you raise money unless you're known? You 
get known by being on TV. How do you get on TV? You need money." 
</P>
<P>
 Little enough political news gets covered by TV, and that tends to be devoted 
to the governor's race. "I fault the electronic media for doing a real 
miserable job of covering politics in this state," says Khachigian. "I think 
the TV and radio stations really ought to be ashamed of themselves for the lame 
way in which they cover politics . . . but the electorate sure can tell you who 
Erik and Lyle Menendez are, and Heidi Fleiss." 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Statham is more benevolent: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't blame the public or press for this lack of coverage. There's been 
this quantum leap in musical political chairs in California" with term limits 
throwing career politicians into other lineups as new players start coming in. 
</P>
<P>
 Any candidate can pay to get the voters' attention -- but remember Alan 
Cranston: The entire campaign budget for one of these statewide candidates 
could be gobbled up in a week's worth of TV spots in a mid-sized California 
city, and not make a dent in the results. 
</P>
<P>
 Those candidates who have any real money would often rather save it for the 
dash to the finish line, which is when most voters begin to tune in, anyway. 
"To compete at the end," says Rob Lapsley, campaign manager for Jones, "you 
have to be able to communicate your message on TV. As hard as you try, you 
cannot reach 15 million voters in California without going on TV. And that 
takes money." 
</P>
<P>
 There is one other way: The slate card. 
</P>
<P>
 Although primary candidates don't run on "tickets," many do pay to get on the 
slates, which are mailed out as top-to-bottom voter recommendations, from 
governor to Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Mailers are like a last bus out: Everyone wants to be on it. A big name at the 
top of the mailer confers some cachet to the candidates near the bottom, 
candidates who couldn't possibly afford such a vast mailing themselves. 
Sometimes there are bidding wars to get on good slate cards, thousands and 
thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "The infamous slate card," says Khachigian. "In these races, slate cards play 
a big role. You talk about buying an election? This is the one time I think you 
can argue in this state that an election can be bought." 
</P>
<P>
 The significance of winning these offices is not only the steppingstones they 
provide to higher office, but the fact that California's founders saw them as 
critical to making the state work. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, the current lieutenant governor? Leo McCarthy, since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 If you read far enough to find that out, you get an A in civics.

RWANDANS SEEK REFUGE IN HUGE TANZANIA CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAMB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In hardly more than a month, this empty valley on the Rwandan border has been 
transformed into the world's largest refugee camp, a sprawling metropolis of 
tents and huts that testifies to unspeakable horrors and mindless violence. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300,000 Rwandans, many in rags, some bearing machete and gunshot 
wounds, have fled across the Kagera River to seek safety in this green, 
nameless valley, to stand for hours in U.N. food lines and, in the process, to 
consider themselves privileged to have the right to live another day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I suppose I am lucky," said Patrice Mukakarisa, who wore a Christian 
cross and held her infant son to her breast. "But this is my only child who 
lives. The other five, my husband, I saw them die when the rebels came to my 
village to kill us all." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ah," said Prucaririe Kayumbu, the woman next to her, "you are lucky. You have 
your baby. Mine is dead, thrown in the river. My village is dead too. They 
killed everyone. I played dead until the rebels left, and then I started 
walking for here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Benaco camp, named for a tiny village nearby, is but one of half a dozen 
that have sprung up in Tanzania, Uganda and Burundi since ethnic fighting 
between the majority Hutus and minority Tutsi erupted in Rwanda after President 
Juvenal Habyarimana and his counterpart from Burundi, Cyprian Ntayamira -- both 
Hutus -- died in a mysterious plane crash April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The fighting has turned one in four of Rwanda's 8 million people into refugees 
and claimed the lives of at least 200,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 As immense as the tragedy is, it could have been even greater had not the 
international community reacted so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a few days of the first refugees' arrival here, relief supplies from 
around the world were being trucked over the rugged dirt roads to Benaco, a 
camp that U.N. officials initially believed would attract no more than 50,000 
Rwandans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering the number of people involved and the suddenness with which they 
came, the relief effort is well-advanced," said John Howard, a water engineer 
with the British charity Oxfam. "At this point it's been a tremendous effort, 
very much a success, I think." 
</P>
<P>
 On an average day, more than 100,000 Rwandans stand in orderly lines for their 
thrice-a-week rations of maize and flour. Water pumped out of a nearby 
river-fed pond is filtered and chlorinated -- and cleaner than the tap water in 
many African capitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of tents have been distributed, health clinics and an operating 
theater set up, crude latrines dug. A cemetery has been paced off, and at last 
count 215 Rwandans had been buried there in several long rows. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a tent, each family receives blankets, a cooking set and a 
plastic jug to haul water. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the hygiene doesn't break down, I think we're going to be OK," said Dieter 
Jacobi, a German Red Cross surgeon who has worked in Africa for eight years. 
"People come in here hungry, but they are not starving. We have plenty of food. 
The malnutrition rate is really rather low for a crisis of this magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've treated malaria, of course, but we haven't seen any cholera or typhoid 
-- knock on wood. The one that's really quite surprising is the attitude of the 
people themselves. They almost seem passive, as though they're taking all of 
this in stride." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the general cheerfulness of the camp seems almost eerie. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups of women will occasionally break into Christian songs as they trek up 
into the hills, water jugs on their heads. Children cavort among the endless 
lines of tents. Old men stand quietly for hours on end, waiting to fill their 
burlap bags with a few pounds of maize. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief agency workers say they know of no crimes, even thievery, being 
committed in the camp. Nor have there been any disturbances of note, even 
though some of the inhabitants are presumed to have been involved in the 
killing in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know how to suffer quietly," said John Mubonyuzuku, a former druggist. 
"This is not a new thing. There has been killing for years. But the problems 
are with the extremists, not with the ordinary people. Here we get along 
whether we are Hutu or Tutsi." 
</P>
<P>
 Their blue and white tents reach up the hills and are packed so closely 
together that from a distance the hills appear as a wave-crested ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Women hunker down along the roadway below the tents, selling sweet potatoes 
and hunks of recently slaughtered goats. Barbers exchange haircuts for a scoop 
of maize, and teachers gather children on little chunks of unclaimed turf to 
recite the day's lessons, although without the help of books. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the camp fly the flags of the United Nations, the Red Cross, Concern, 
Oxfam and other relief agencies. They remind those such as Mubonyuzuku that he 
is now an international ward. Like the others here, he dares not guess when he 
will be able to return home.

COLUMN ONE; STUCK IN THE MUD IN RUSSIA; THE SPRING THAW AND NOTORIOUSLY BAD 
ROADS MEAN A MISERABLE MONTH OF MUCK. STRANDED RESIDENTS COMPLAIN THE 
GOVERNMENT LEAVES TOO MANY ROUTES UNPAVED WITH BAD INTENTIONS.

<P>
 The road to Anna Tsvetkova's house meanders two miles down a deeply rutted 
dirt track, sometimes vanishing into the vast, marshy, muddy morass that is 
Russia in springtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars and trucks are no match for the devouring muck; only the clumpy wheel 
prints of heavy Soviet tractors show where the road once lay. A sturdy villager 
with good rubber boots can make the two-mile trek in less than an hour. But the 
nearest doctor is 11 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I get sick, I will just have to die," Tsvetkova said with the blunt 
fatalism bred of 80 years of Russian peasant life. "Nobody fixes our road." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has spring; Russia has mud. Come April, the sticky black 
stuff is as omnipresent as snow in winter. It oozes up from under the sidewalk, 
splatters pedestrians to the waist and clings fast to everything that moves. 
</P>
<P>
 Germans and Swedes, Finns and Norwegians, all have managed to build roads that 
stand up to a climate nearly as harsh as Russia's. But they have a historical 
fondness for good roads -- and far less territory to cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the 20th Century draws to a close, the Soviet-built road system is 
still no match for the indomitable Russian mud. 
</P>
<P>
 So tenacious is the mire that some rich city Russians forsake their Mercedeses 
in spring for imported Range Rovers that fare better on the tough drive to the 
country dacha. 
</P>
<P>
 Rural dwellers just brace themselves for up to a month of soggy isolation 
during the spring thaw (and the autumn rains), much as they have done for 
centuries. They call the condition bezdorozhye , or "roadlessness." 
</P>
<P>
 The enduring nature of this misfortune is a symbol of how inexplicably 
difficult it has always been -- and how difficult it remains -- to change 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Ural Mountains to the Bering Sea, spring melt in the permafrost zone 
creates thousands of square miles of mire, and huge swaths of territory are 
accessible only by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 Roadlessness also reigns in European Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Mud-locked Podosyonovo, a pleasant summer dacha site for Muscovites in the 
Tver region, is only 105 miles from the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
 In the nearest city, Kimry, asphalt roads that seemed solid enough last summer 
have all but disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials blame marshy soil that simply swallows up roads unless they 
are shored up every three or four years, and blame Moscow for never sending 
enough money to maintain them. Outside City Hall, the main street is so deeply 
cratered that traffic barely outpaces pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 During mud season, those who can avoid driving do. 
</P>
<P>
 The railroads are built to withstand the spring onslaught, and train travel 
nowadays is rarely disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 Villagers in towns such as Podosyonovo -- which lies along the Medveditsa 
River, a tributary of the Volga -- travel by boat if they can. For those who do 
not own tractors, the best way to brave the mud is on horseback. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia has two woes: roads and fools," an old maxim says. The villagers of 
Syrkino, a few miles from Podosyonovo, complain of both. Local authorities have 
been promising them a paved road for years, but a waterlogged dirt lane is all 
that links the outside world to their 16 wooden farmhouses with old-fashioned 
carved and brightly painted trim. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tried stone, then they laid sand, but nothing held," said Vladimir 
Kurilov, who runs the local library. "In two or three years, the land just 
swallowed it up." 
</P>
<P>
 As Russia's economic crisis worsens, bus service along the dirt road has 
become more irregular, villagers said. 
</P>
<P>
 A truck that is supposed to deliver fresh bread comes only once a week. During 
mud season, it sometimes does not come at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bread is stale!" shouted farmer Antonina Kuchumova, waving a hard brown 
loaf she had plucked from the back of the truck. "In the Soviet times, there 
was bus service, and under the democrats there is none. Of course it is 
difficult in spring and fall, but how did the bus make it here in Soviet 
times?" 
</P>
<P>
 Other elderly villagers stood ankle-deep in the muddy road and nodded in 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the local officials want to go fishing or pick mushrooms, we have bus 
service," Kuchumova said bitterly. "The rest of the time, they say the roads 
are too bad." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our roads are truly a national tragedy," said Robert G. Kudryashov, deputy 
director general of the Russian Highway Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to remedy the problem have bogged down in the country's worsening 
economic crisis, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's vast territory was mostly settled by river, and water remained the 
most reliable form of transportation until the railroads were built in the late 
19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 The first paved road was not built in Russia until 1817, and by 1913 the 
nation still had only 10,108 miles of pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in Josef Stalin's time, horse-drawn sleighs still glided down flat frozen 
riverbeds in winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every great Russian writer, from Nikolai Gogol to modern satirists, has 
lamented the nation's primitive, muddy highways, a tradition that persists to 
this day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian language even has a term that combines an expletive with the word 
for pothole. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel in winter, cold as it may be, is actually easier than in spring. 
</P>
<P>
 In the marshy far north, cars and trucks move more easily across the 
hard-frozen steppe. 
</P>
<P>
 In spring, the snow melts, and up to eight feet of marshy ground thaws. But 
the bottom layer of permafrost stays frozen, and the water, with nowhere to 
drain, turns the top layer of soil into a thick, muddy soup. 
</P>
<P>
 Gogol wrote of the pervasive mud and the "black-footed" peasant girls of the 
black earth region of southern Russia, a fertile crescent whose sticky soil 
resembles that of the U.S. Dakotas. 
</P>
<P>
 To stop the mud, Russians once tossed rough-hewn logs across the marshiest 
sections of road. In 1839, the Marquis de Custine, a French nobleman, described 
travel by carriage outside of St. Petersburg as bone-jarring torment. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are to believe the Russians, all their roads are good during the summer 
season, even those that are not the great highways," the marquis wrote. "I find 
them all bad." 
</P>
<P>
 And while Russia's General Winter is credited for defeating the invading 
armies of Sweden's Charles XII, Napoleon and Hitler, General Mud deserves equal 
kudos, according to military historians. 
</P>
<P>
 Napoleon lost much of his artillery to the October muck on his way to Moscow, 
severely weakening his army even before winter set in, according to Alexander 
N. Krenke, head of the climatology laboratory of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 "The snow beat Napoleon only at the very end," Krenke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Napoleon was fortunate that he did not venture farther south, he said. "If it 
had been black earth mud, Napoleon himself would have disappeared into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hitler's Panzer divisions also bogged down in the autumn mud, his generals 
unprepared for the bitter winter and appalled by the dreadful highways. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Germans had this Western, civilized mentality that saw a tank as 100 
times stronger than man, and felt that when such a huge machine bogged down, 
there was nothing man could do about it," military historian Yuri A. Polyakov 
said. Russian soldiers, inured to mud, would simply pick their own tanks up, or 
haul them out with ropes and horses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Soviet Union made a wartime virtue of its brutal weather and backward 
highways with the propaganda slogan, "What is good for a Russian is death to a 
German," Polyakov said. 
</P>
<P>
 The slogan also reflects a secret, sneaking, stubborn pride that Russians feel 
in the very roads they curse. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the romance of a tough people who are envious and yet contemptuous of 
effete foreigners, and who see Russia's daunting isolation as a source of its 
spiritual strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bad roads were the sickness of the Russian state," said transportation expert 
Sergei A. Takhov of the Russian Institute of Geography. "But they preserved 
Russia's virginity." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Russians frequently point to their crumbling pavement as proof of the 
ineptitude of President Boris N. Yeltsin's government. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Yeltsin himself is a man who appreciates a good road. 
</P>
<P>
 In his new memoir, "The Struggle for Russia," Yeltsin writes that the 
long-delayed paving of the route to his dacha in Arkhangelskoye, about 15 miles 
from Moscow, took place Aug. 19, 1991, the day of the hard-line Communist coup 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Impulsively, I went up and introduced myself to the guys working on the 
road," Yeltsin wrote. "The hell with the coup, this historic event! The hot 
asphalt smelled strangely reassuring. It meant the convenience of a road." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite major Soviet road-building programs, Russia still has only about 
420,000 miles of paved roads -- 1/20th the number of U.S. roads per square mile 
-- and needs twice that amount, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, after nearly a decade of economic decline, roads and bridges that 
were never designed to carry 10-ton trucks are decaying quickly. What is 
repaired is often done shoddily. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Moscow roads are a nightmare!" Polyakov wailed. "Sometimes when they 
patch them, they lay asphalt right in pools of water." 
</P>
<P>
 As Russia tries to forge new economic and trade links to the West, officials 
say the need to upgrade the aging infrastructure is acute. That includes a 
Third World telephone system, an antiquated air-traffic control system, wildly 
energy-inefficient utilities and, of course, the transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic on Russian roads crawls at an average speed of less than 19 m.p.h., 
compared to 50 m.p.h. on European roads, according to the Highway Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad roads boost transportation costs by up to 30%, wear out tires up to 
80% faster, shorten the service life of automobiles by up to one-third and cut 
overall productivity in half. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say roads in America are good because dollars roll along them," 
Kudryashov said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. manufacturers can keep small inventories because they can quickly order 
and receive supplies and spare parts, while Russian factories, especially in 
the north, must stockpile during the short summer most of what they need for 
the rest of the year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But money to upgrade the highways -- so urgently needed if Russian industry is 
ever to compete in the global market -- is in desperately short supply. So are 
bulldozers, graders and asphalt-laying machines, equipment that is now mostly 
made in another country -- Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospects for change, as always in Russia, are dubious. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, Russia's leading bard predicted as much. Alexander Pushkin wrote in 
"Eugene Onegin," his 1831 epic poem, of a future Russia united by roads. It 
would be changed beyond recognition -- and perhaps even unencumbered by mud -- 
"after, say, 500 years."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / TREASURER; ROBERTI AND ANGELIDES SLUG IT OUT; CONTEST 
TURNS UGLY AS DEVELOPER, A FORMER STATE DEMOCRATIC PARTY CHAIRMAN, ATTACKS 
LONGTIME SENATE LEADER'S RECORD. A COUNTEROFFENSIVE TARGETS THE BUSINESSMAN'S 
DEALINGS.

<P>
 Those seeking the office of state treasurer might be expected to engage in 
lofty discussions of bond sales, pension investments and credit ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 But the below-the-belt Democratic party contest over who gets to follow in 
Kathleen Brown's footsteps has turned this statewide campaign into the most 
spirited, perhaps nastiest such matchup so far this primary season. 
</P>
<P>
 In a headline-grabbing race, a well-financed but little-known underdog is 
aggressively taking on a nearly three-decade politician who is as much a part 
of the Sacramento scene as the domed Capitol itself. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the point, says Phil Angelides, a Sacramento developer and former 
state Democratic Party chairman who, in his first run for statewide office, has 
amassed a larger war chest than anyone else seeking state office outside of the 
governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 With nearly $3 million set aside to make his a household name before Election 
Day, June 7, Angelides is attacking state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) 
for his longtime role as a Senate leader during California's period of economic 
decline and the FBI's lengthy political corruption investigation of the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Angelides unveiled a 30-second TV ad skewering Roberti for placing 
into positions of power three corrupt state senators "even though . . . he knew 
of their sleazy reputations." The three, state Sens. Joseph Montoya 
(D-Whittier), Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys) and Paul B. Carpenter (D-Downey), were 
convicted on federal corruption charges after an FBI investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 This follows quickly on the heels of a commercial that attacks Roberti for his 
anti-abortion rights stance by implying he condoned the fatal shooting of 
abortion doctor David Gunn outside a Pensacola, Fla., clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti accuses Angelides of conducting "a smear job." His campaign focuses on 
exposing Angelides as a "cut and run" developer who removed his name from 
properties on the verge of being repossessed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's anything the public wants less than a longtime politician," the 
veteran senator says, "it's a real estate speculator in charge of the state's 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates say they seek the job for all the traditional reasons and then 
some. They want to help California regain top-tier credit ratings, invest state 
pension money wisely, sell bonds prudently, help rebuild the economy and create 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti, 55, who has represented portions of Los Angeles in the Legislature 
for 27 years, 13 of them as Senate leader, likes to remind voters he stood up 
to the gun lobby in his defeat of a spring recall campaign that targeted him 
because of his assault weapon control legislation. Angelides, 40, points to his 
successes in business and in leading the 1992 ballot-box charge for the 
Democratic Party after 12 years of Reagan-Bush. Whoever emerges victorious will 
run in November against Republican Matthew Fong, 40, a State Board of 
Equalization member who is unopposed in the GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the Democrats, the contest started with a gentlemen's agreement to 
refrain from competing for the party's endorsement, but it has quickly 
degenerated to the point where each tries to discredit and undercut the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelides touts a long list of endorsements that include some environmental 
groups, a handful of Hollywood's elite and California's two U.S. senators, 
Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer. Roberti supporters charge that the list 
merely reflects pay-back time and that Angelides is simply collecting debts 
from backers whom he aided as party chair. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Roberti says his lengthy legislative experience would serve him 
well as state treasurer if he has to forge consensus among lawmakers on state 
bond proposals. Angelides, however, speaks of "the three crooks" Roberti put in 
Senate leadership positions. Roberti points out he has never been charged with 
a crime and says, "People are innocent until proven guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 As barbed as the corruption ad may be, it was Angelides' abortion-rights spot 
that drove the biggest wedge between two men who, just a short while ago, were 
on the same side of the table. 
</P>
<P>
 The fast-paced commercial opens with a shot of raucous anti-abortion 
protesters blocking a clinic, moves quickly to scenes of Dr. Gunn's 1993 
funeral and then flashes an image of Roberti on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Violent anti-choice extremists attack clinics," an announcer says. "A doctor 
murdered. But L.A. Sen. David Roberti refuses to vote to protect clinics, 
attempts to cut off funding, and writes a constitutional ban on abortion. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelides defends the ad as relevant because the state treasurer sits on the 
California Health Facilities Financing Authority, which provides tax-exempt 
funding for construction of hospitals and clinics. Roberti, he claims, is a 
"zealot" who might refuse to fund facilities that provide abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelides, on the other hand, calls himself "the candidate of choice," a 
reference to his pro-abortion rights position. His strategy is not lost on 
political observers who note that, in the 1992 California Democratic primary, 
57% of the voters who turned out were women. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti, a staunch Catholic, insists he has a strong record on women's issues 
and maintains he is far from fanatical on the question of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently with little money to launch a TV blitz of his own, an irate Roberti 
calls the ad "shocking, mean and beneath contempt" and denounces the killing of 
Gunn as "horrific." 
</P>
<P>
 Noting his coffers were depleted by spending $800,000 to defeat the recall led 
by the gun lobby, Roberti charges: "The NRA could take some lessons from Phil 
Angelides as to delivering low blows. Phil Angelides is doing the NRA's dirty 
work for them. Their intent is to try to ruin my career and he's a willing 
accomplice." 
</P>
<P>
 But Roberti is launching a counteroffensive to get the word out about 
Angelides' record during a 10-year boom period in which he amassed wealth 
through some 35 business partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 During the decade, Roberti alleges, "failed developer" Angelides paved over 
wetlands, ducked out of tax payments and bailed out of his biggest development 
-- a Sacramento suburban community called Laguna West -- just before financial 
turbulence hit and the bank repossessed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelides admits to selling off his portion of Laguna West but says he did so 
to focus on his treasurer's bid and, at any rate, he still manages the project. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a development that he is unfailingly proud of, he says, noting that its 
neo-traditionalist "pedestrian pocket" design has been heralded by urban 
affairs writers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Rave reviews of the development's design didn't stop Roberti from leading 
reporters on a bus tour of Laguna West last week in a press event advertised as 
the "Phil Angelides Take the Money and Run Tour '94." Staci Walters, the 
senator's campaign manager, passed out T-shirts, explaining dryly: "They drew 
first blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Passing by rows of stucco houses and many vacant lots, Roberti remarked that 
the development looked "straight out of East Berlin" and said, "It's nice 
because you can have the appearance of neighbors and not have any." 
</P>
<P>
 "David Roberti can make up whatever he wants," says Angelides, "but Laguna 
West is a good project that's created jobs and that's a model. For him to try 
to twist that shows how desperate he is to stay in office." 
</P>
<P>
 While he paints Roberti as a job-shopping careerist in an era when California 
cries out for fresh leadership, Angelides holds himself up as the outsider with 
energy and business savvy. 
</P>
<P>
 He points to his bulging campaign bank account as evidence that people are 
receptive to his message. During this election cycle, Angelides has raised $2.3 
million from about 4,000 contributors, most of whom he says gave checks of $250 
or smaller. On top of that is the $500,000 personal check he recently pumped 
into his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which has Roberti seeing an opportunity to lob another shot his 
opponent's way. "I don't see why he's so proud of the fact that he's a rich 
man. To me it's astounding he's so happy he's rich." 
</P>
<P>
 Grouses Walters, "Angelides is stretching the facts as far as he can because 
he knows we don't have the money to go after him. He's just slinging mud 
because he knows he can."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / LEGISLATURE; 'BUSINESS' IS NEW BUZZWORD FOR CANDIDATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK and JERRY GILLAM, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Business is picking up these days in the state Capitol. Or so it would seem 
from the flood of business people hoping to move here. 
</P>
<P>
 With the advent of term limits and the public's continuing dissatisfaction 
with the state Legislature, the 1990s have become the era of the business 
candidate. This June, nearly a third of all legislative hopefuls are using the 
word business in their ballot title -- a higher percentage than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the appellation has become so popular that even many incumbent 
legislators are adopting it, giving themselves such ballot descriptions as 
"Businessman/Senator" or "Assemblywoman/Businesswoman." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a new awakening among small-business people," said first-term 
Assemblywoman Barbara Alby (R-Fair Oaks), who runs a concrete construction 
business with her husband out of their home and is listed on the ballot this 
year as "Business Owner/Legislator." "My husband said one of us had to go into 
politics to try to change things. I'm not too good at finishing concrete, so I 
went." 
</P>
<P>
 The number of business candidates on the ballot began to soar after the voters 
imposed term limits in 1990. This year, there are nearly twice as many business 
candidates as there are incumbents, and nearly five times as many business 
designations as the next largest occupation: teacher or school official. 
</P>
<P>
 Some political analysts say the phenomenon has begun to change the composition 
of the Legislature, making for fewer career politicians and more merchants and 
entrepreneurs who can afford to take a few years away from their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 But others suggest that many of these self-styled business candidates have 
only a tenuous connection to the title and are attempting to capitalize on the 
public's disdain for politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "The anti-incumbency feeling is strong, and the mood is to kick the rascals 
out," said veteran assemblyman and non-businessman Phillip Isenberg 
(D-Sacramento). "So it doesn't surprise me that every political candidate 
running for every office wants to try to tag themselves as an outsider 
somehow." 
</P>
<P>
 Until the mid-1960s, the Legislature was dominated by attorneys who served as 
part-time lawmakers, enhancing their prestige and law practices by traveling to 
the Capitol for the session each year. 
</P>
<P>
 But after 1966, when the Legislature became full-time and salaries went up, 
serving in the Senate or Assembly became a career, attracting business people, 
attorneys, educators and local government officials, among others. During the 
1970s and 1980s, many legislative aides also ran for office, contributing to 
the aura of the Legislature as a home for career politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 140, approved by the voters in 1990, appears to be changing all 
that. With a six-year limit on serving in the Assembly and an eight-year limit 
on Senate terms, longtime incumbents have begun leaving in droves, making room 
for a new breed of candidate. By the end of 1998, the changeover of each house 
will be complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Senator and container manufacturer Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove) typifies the new 
kind of business legislator who is making a mark on the Capitol. Elected in 
1993 in a special election, he makes no attempt to hide the fact he is in a 
hurry to fulfill his conservative agenda, which includes helping other business 
candidates win election to the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "My approach is different from career politicians'," he said. "A businessman 
has to make things happen. If you don't, you're out of business . . . I can 
come up and do it for a short time. I'm not interested in making a career of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, candidates have used a wide range of job descriptions on the 
ballot, including poker-player, peon, female impersonator and mother trucker. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary of state, who oversees elections, does not attempt to verify 
whether candidates are actually what they claim, relying on their opponents to 
uncover any falsehoods. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times analysis of primary ballot titles shows that 124 legislative 
candidates are using the term business in their designation on the June 7 
ballot -- 31% of all candidates. In the more crowded June, 1992, primary, there 
were 142 self-described business candidates -- a total of 29% of all 
contestants. By contrast, there were 39 business candidates in the June, 1984, 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Steven T. Kuykendall is mayor of Rancho Palos Verdes and director 
of institutional credit for a mortgage banking firm. Running for the Assembly, 
he describes himself as "Businessman/Mayor" on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in an environment that has got to be more business-friendly," 
Kuykendall said. "Business is not the bad guy." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, having a business image is so desirable that 11 of the 69 incumbent 
lawmakers seeking reelection are using a joint business-legislator designation. 
Rep. Richard W. Pombo (R-Tracy) is taking it one step further: The first-term 
congressman lists himself only as "Rancher." 
</P>
<P>
 "People in the Legislature are very sensitive to the charge they are full-time 
politicians, have lost touch with the people and are captured by the 
lobbyists," said UC Berkeley political science professor Bruce Cain. "By 
designating themselves by their (other) occupation they can be real people with 
real jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 As a video rental store owner in Chico, Bernie Richter built up name 
recognition by calling himself "Crazy Bernie" in television commercials. Now, 
as a first-term GOP assemblyman, he is calling himself 
"Assemblymember/Businessman" on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes he is part of a new trend of merchants coming to Sacramento to 
reform government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six years or eight years is probably long enough to get something done if you 
really work your butt off," he said. "Old-time legislators would come up here 
and wait to work themselves up through the committee chairs. We don't have time 
for that." 
</P>
<P>
 If newly elected business-oriented legislators have had any effect on policy, 
it has not yet become noticeable. Most of them belong to the minority 
Republican Party and, as a result, do not have much clout in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the most significant pro-business measures passed by the 
Legislature were bills that tightened eligibility requirements and increased 
benefits for workers' compensation. But those bills would appear to be the 
result of threats by business to leave the state over workers' compensation 
costs -- not the product of activism by businessmen-turned-legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 For some candidates, using the term businessman is more a matter of image than 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer Burton, a Democratic candidate for the Assembly in East Los Angeles, 
lists himself as "businessman" on the ballot. In an interview, he explained, 
"My business is I am actively engaged in pursuing a state Assembly office." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Piechowski, a Republican candidate running for the Senate in South-Central 
Los Angeles, also calls himself "businessman." He said he is the communications 
director for a nonprofit think tank that studies popular culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Nao Takasugi (R-Oxnard), running for his second term, lists 
himself as "Businessman/Legislator" even though his family sold its grocery 
store 12 years ago. He is now a landlord, renting space to the grocery and a 
fast-food chicken outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) said he was skeptical of many 
of the candidates in both parties who call themselves businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "That just shows you how big the recession is, all of these unemployed 
entrepreneurs apparently are now looking to government to restore their faith, 
trust and confidence," he quipped. "If they were really successful business 
people, they wouldn't be looking to work here. Give me a break." Political 
Business 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the leading occupations of Senate and Assembly candidates as they 
described themselves on the ballot in the four most recent primary elections. 
In the June 7 primary, a record 31% of candidates are calling themselves 
business people. 05,30,06,06,06,06 1988 1990 1992 1994 * Business 62 75 142 124 
* Incumbent legislator 95 89 73 69 * Teacher or school official 19 35 49 25 * 
Local government official 20 16 36 18 * Attorney 15 9 39 18 Note: Some 
incumbents also have other occupations, such as attorney, but did not identify 
themselves on the ballot and are listed here only as legislators. Candidates 
who used two designations, such as "businessman/legislator" are listed as both.

JOHN WEIDNER, HERO IN HOLOCAUST, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Henry Weidner, the Dutch-born hero decorated by many nations for rescuing 
more than 1,000 Jews and Allied airmen from the Nazis during World War II, has 
died at his home in Monterey Park. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
 Weidner, who moved to the United States in the mid-1950s to escape memories of 
the war, died Saturday of heart failure, the Southern California Conference of 
Seventh-day Adventists announced Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The pacifist son of a Seventh-day Adventist minister, Weidner was a leader of 
the Dutch-Paris underground, which operated escape routes from war-torn 
Holland, Belgium and France into neutral Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 He was captured repeatedly, interrogated by Klaus Barbie, the infamous 
"Butcher of Lyon," and tortured by the Gestapo and France's Milice secret 
police. He always escaped, jumping off trains, swimming the Rhine under Nazi 
fire, and once diving out a third-floor prison window just prior to his 
scheduled execution. 
</P>
<P>
 For his efforts, Weidner earned the Order of the British Empire, the Dutch 
Order of Orange-Nassau and Medal of Resistance, the French Croix de Guerre and 
the Medaille de la Resistance, Belgium's Order of King Leopold II and the U.S. 
Medal of Freedom with Gold Palms. He was also designated an officer of the 
French Legion of Honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel, recognizing him as a "Righteous Gentile," entered his name as a hero 
in the Golden Book of Jerusalem and planted a tree with his name on the Hill of 
Remembrance along the Avenue of the Righteous at Yad Vashem. Also recognized by 
the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Weidner was one of seven people chosen to light 
candles at last year's opening of the Holocaust Memorial in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Weidner's wartime exploits were chronicled in the 1966 book by Herbert Ford 
titled "Flee the Captor." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantic Union College last year established the John Henry Weidner Center for 
the Cultivation of the Altruistic Spirit, which will sponsor lectures, 
concerts, classes, exhibits and social programs promoting altruism. 
</P>
<P>
 "During my father's lifetime," Weidner said in a speech in Pasadena honoring 
Holocaust victims in 1989, "he taught me, my family, his parishioners and the 
community that the most important quality in a human being was to love, respect 
and treat our fellow man as we wished to be loved, respected and treated." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a witness to the barbaric treatment of the Jews by the Nazis. I 
personally observed the crushing of the skull of a Jewish infant who was torn 
out of the arms of its mother," he said. "I was determined to heed the 
teachings and example of my father and I did everything that I could to save as 
many lives as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Weidner grew up and was educated in France, where his father taught Greek and 
Hebrew at a Seventh-day Adventist college near the Swiss border. Still in 
France when the war broke out, the young businessman worked with the ecumenical 
Geneva-based World Council of Churches to shepherd Jewish refugees to 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 He became one of the Gestapo's most wanted men in Europe with a 
5-million-franc price on his head, partially because of the prominence of some 
he saved. They included Gerni van Heuven Godehart, who later won a Nobel Prize, 
and Lt. Bram Van der Stok, who became minister of justice for the Dutch 
government-in-exile. 
</P>
<P>
 Weidner aided in prosecuting war criminals after the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving to Southern California, Weidner married an American and opened a chain 
of health food stores in the San Gabriel Valley called Weidner Nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
 Weidner is survived by his wife, Naomi; a sister, Annette Hipleh, and a 
nephew. Another sister, Gabrielle, died in the Nazis' Ravensbrueck 
concentration camp. 
</P>
<P>
 A public memorial service is scheduled at 2 p.m. Saturday at the Seventh-day 
Adventist Church at 9664 E. Broadway, Temple City.

WARTIME KING HONORED FOR SAVING 50,000 BULGARIAN JEWS; HOLOCAUST: ORANGE COUNTY 
RABBI SAYS HE WAS ONE OF THOSE KING BORIS III OF BULGARIA REFUSED TO HAND OVER 
TO HIS ALLY, ADOLF HITLER. THE KING'S SON, SIMEON II, ACCEPTS THANKS FROM 
SURVIVORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A rabbi who was among 50,000 Bulgarian Jews saved from the Nazis by the late 
king of Bulgaria read thankful passages of Scripture here Sunday in the 
presence of his rescuer's son and heir. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 2,500 worshipers at the Crystal Cathedral heard Rabbi Haim Asa declare, 
"God has blessed us with salvation." 
</P>
<P>
 And to the deeply moved King Simeon II, son of the late King Boris III, Asa 
said, "We thank you for the gift of life that your father gave my people." 
</P>
<P>
 Asa, the spiritual leader of Fullerton's Temple Beth Tikvah, fled from wartime 
Europe with his family, one among the estimated 50,000 -- virtually the 
country's entire Jewish population -- saved from almost certain death at the 
hands of the Nazis by the courageous actions of King Boris. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend, the rabbi and other grateful former subjects are honoring the 
late king. The festivities included Friday dinner at Sephardic Tifereth Israel 
Temple in Los Angeles, Sunday's "Hour of Power" internationally televised show, 
and a tour set for today at the Simon Wiesenthal Center Museum of Tolerance in 
the company of Branko Lustig, the Academy Award-winning producer of 
"Schindler's List," and a Holocaust survivor. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ceremony tonight in Beverly Hills, King Boris will be posthumously 
awarded the Jewish National Fund's Medal of the Legion of Honor, the first 
non-Jew to receive one of the Jewish community's highest honors. 
</P>
<P>
 King Simeon, who seemed near tears during Sunday's service, said he is deeply 
moved by the recognition of his father's efforts. "For a son to see such 
genuine and good-hearted recognition is gratifying," he said in an interview, 
"but what my father did was only what any decent person would have done." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1943, King Boris -- whose country was officially aligned with Germany -- 
refused Hitler's direct orders to deport Bulgaria's Jews to Germany for 
extermination. Instead the king urged the Jews to move to the countryside and 
blend in with the general population. And he told the Fuehrer that he needed 
them to help build roads. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 14, 1943, Boris was summoned by Hitler to Germany, where the two had a 
meeting described by eyewitnesses as a tense and angry showdown over the Jewish 
matter and his refusal to send Bulgarian troops for the Russian front. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, the 49-year-old king died under mysterious circumstances; 
some believe he was poisoned on Hitler's orders. Six years old at the time, the 
new King Simeon II was deposed by the Communists after the war. He has lived in 
exile in Spain ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Asa's efforts to gain recognition for King Boris began 32 years ago when he 
wrote his master's thesis on the subject. In his crusade, the rabbi says he 
kept running into two obstacles: Bulgaria's Communist regime's reluctance to 
glorify the monarch it had deposed, and certain elements of the American Jewish 
community, which were unwilling to admit or unaware that an ally of Germany 
could have saved so many. 
</P>
<P>
 That resistance eroded, the rabbi said, after two recent events: the end of 
Bulgaria's Communist regime in 1990, and the success of "Schindler's List," a 
film about a German who rescued Jews under the Nazis' noses. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you find a man who saved 50,000 Jews, how can you not honor him?" said 
David Horne, Los Angeles chairman for the Jewish National Fund. "It's critical 
for people to know that someone who was the head of a state did something so 
important." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Mandel, president of the American Congress of Jewish Concentration Camp 
Survivors, based in Los Angeles, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "He should have been recognized a long time ago," Mandel said of King Boris. 
Unfortunately, he added, human nature "is never to find somebody who saved, but 
only to persecute the ones who did wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 For Asa, "this is important because history has to be made an instrument of 
good, not only evil. History must teach that there was as much good in certain 
places as there was evil in others."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: TV DEBATES' DRAMA IS NOT JUST ON THE AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're a political candidate, there's a basic drill for preparing to debate 
the enemy on television: 
</P>
<P>
 * Determine your main message to viewers and program yourself to always return 
to it like a mantra, no matter the question. Thus, if Treasurer Kathleen Brown 
is asked about gang violence, she blames Gov. Pete Wilson for the loss of 
500,000 jobs and pledges to create 1 million new ones when she's elected 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Determine your vulnerability and prepare a defense. So if Brown is asked 
about her opposition to the death penalty, she can respond with something more 
reassuring than: "That's irrelevant because I intend to enforce the law." 
</P>
<P>
 * Devise a wild card to play at an opportune moment. And be alert for your 
opponent's sudden use of a wild card. For example, have in reserve a catchy 
sound bite such as Walter F. Mondale's 1984 retort to Sen. Gary Hart: "Where's 
the beef?" And, if you're Hart, don't then look like a deer in headlights. 
</P>
<P>
 There also are other lessons learned from over the years, such as don't sweat 
(Richard Nixon, 1960) and don't look at your watch (George Bush, 1992). 
</P>
<P>
 A televised debate can be a defining event for a candidate and be pivotal in 
an election, although not necessarily. More often, despite the hoopla, it's 
just a 24-hour story. 
</P>
<P>
 An exception was the 1990 gubernatorial debate between Republican Wilson and 
Democrat Dianne Feinstein. Wilson captured the headlines, defined himself as a 
candidate of change and forever alienated Democratic legislators by 
unexpectedly endorsing the term limits initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, a trio of gubernatorial debates -- bunched on successive days like 
no others before -- may help define the candidates for voters, but likely won't 
be pivotal in the June 7 Democratic primary. 
</P>

 Brown is running so far ahead -- by 19 points in the latest Field Poll -- that 
she probably could stand with her back to the camera and still not be caught by 
Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi with only two weeks left in the race. 
Brown has the same two advantages she's always had: Unlimited funds for TV ads, 
while Garamendi campaigns hand-to-mouth, and a Democratic electorate dominated 
by women who support her 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 To use a football metaphor, Garamendi needs to complete a long bomb for a 
touchdown -- then recover an onside kick. Conversely, Brown seems to have 
approached these debates as a quarterback with only one play in mind: Bunch the 
line, take the snap, kneel and run out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown -- who as front-runner pretty much dictated the game rules -- crammed 
the three debates within a 43-hour period. The first two are tonight in 
Sacramento and Tuesday night in San Francisco, both televised locally. The 
third will be Wednesday afternoon on Los Angeles talk radio, moderated by 
KABC's Michael Jackson. The bunching assures that if Brown fumbles in one of 
the first two debates, she has a chance to quickly recover in the next. 
</P>
<P>
 Her strategists also tried to prevent live telecasting statewide by forbidding 
the host TV station from making its signal available in other cities. That 
caused such an embarrassing uproar that the Brown camp caved on the San 
Francisco debate and is allowing out-of-town stations to telecast it. But the 
Sacramento debate still will be blacked out elsewhere. The Los Angeles radio 
debate will be taped by C-SPAN for later viewing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown camp spin is that it wanted each debate to be "regional." But the 
conclusion of neutral political pros is that Brown's handlers are afraid she 
isn't quite ready for prime time. They wanted to start her show on the road 
before bringing it to Broadway in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the third debate participant, state Sen. Tom Hayden of Santa Monica, 
he's just happy to finally get some playing time. He really isn't running for 
governor; he's running for attention. And starting tonight he'll get it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, I'm not a campaign consultant. But if I were, I'd advise Brown 
not to worry about fumbling, be bold and run right at Wilson. This is a 
priceless opportunity to kick him down the field and begin building momentum 
for the general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters, however, want more than just her sterile plan for creating 1 million 
jobs. That's fine, but they also hunger for some sincere passion about 
restoring the California good life. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd have gambled and gotten this on every TV set possible because Brown's the 
most telegenic California politician since Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi should take his best shot at her, but exit on the high road with 
sights set on a Cabinet post in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that's the view of an uninvolved spectator with the luxury of being 
able to enjoy it all -- if not always on television.

RUSSIANS FALL VICTIM TO THE BOOMERANG LOGIC OF BOSNIA; BALKANS: SERBIAN LEADERS 
INSISTED MOSCOW SEND PEACEKEEPERS. NOW THE POLICEMEN ARE BEING TARGETED BY 
REBEL GUNMEN.

 Vladimir Krapivin's meaty hands form a bowl under his collection of shell 
fragments, proffered as evidence of the harassment he and other Russian 
policemen endure as they wait to play their part in a stalled U.N. airlift for 
northern Bosnia's war victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "They shoot at us all the time," says the exasperated Russian, deployed to the 
U.N.-controlled airport here to inspect aid cargo for contraband. "They get 
drunk, and they shoot at anything that moves." 
</P>
<P>
 Krapivin is not grousing about Bosnian government forces, who object to the 
assignment of Russian civilian policemen to the airlift for fear they will work 
on behalf of their Slavic Christian brothers, the rebel Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic who insisted on the deployment of 
80 Russian police monitors as a condition for consenting to the humanitarian 
relief flights that will mostly benefit Muslim refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, in the boomerang logic of Balkan politics, it is the Serbs who are 
shooting at the Russians, just as they target other U.N. soldiers and 
policemen. 
</P>
<P>
 The artillery shells and mortars are random expressions of wrath at the U.N. 
Protection Force, which last month halted a deadly Serbian offensive against 
the eastern city of Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 While some of the 400 Russian troops deployed to Serb-held areas around the 
capital of Sarajevo say they believe that the globally condemned Serbian 
nationalists have been getting an unfair rap, the first four policemen assigned 
to Tuzla's airport have taken pains to appear impartial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not here as Russians but as members of UNPROFOR," insists Yevgeny 
Cherenkov, jutting his chin toward the sky-blue U.N. emblem stitched to his 
sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
 That internationalist pose has riled the Serbian gunmen, who have the airport 
in their sights from less than five miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-week Serbian offensive against Gorazde that captured nearly half of 
the U.N.-designated safe area and killed hundreds of Muslim civilians 
discredited the rebels in the eyes of the outside world, including their 
traditional allies in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's deputy foreign minister and special Balkans envoy, Vitaly S. Churkin, 
complained after shuttling among Serbian leaders in a failed attempt to head 
off the Gorazde debacle that he had never been lied to so much in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian troops guarding impounded Serbian weapons in the Sarajevo suburb of 
Hreso were taken captive by angry rebels after token North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization air strikes against Serbs attacking Gorazde, and a Ukrainian 
soldier was shot to death in Serb-held territory there last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever sympathies the Slavic peacekeepers might have had for the Serbs seem 
to be waning as they are exposed to indiscriminate acts of retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the isolation the Serbian nationalists have brought on themselves since 
Gorazde may be dawning on them, because signs have emerged in the last few days 
that they want to repair relations with the U.N. mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia-Herzegovina's Muslim-led government had refused to resume negotiations 
on an ethnic partitioning plan proposed by the United States, Russia and 
Western Europe, complaining that the Serbs were blatantly violating a NATO 
ultimatum to withdraw from a 1.9-mile radius around Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officers in Gorazde have confirmed that at least 150 Serbian soldiers 
remained deployed inside the exclusion zone after an April 21 deadline, having 
switched from army camouflage to blue jumpsuits to masquerade as civilian 
policemen. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Serbian military official, rebel Chief of Staff Manojlo Milovanovic, 
promised U.N. officials that all armed Serbian forces would be withdrawn from 
the Gorazde safe area by 6 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The pledge raised hopes among U.N. officials that the rebels want to restart 
peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. monitors reported no signs of an impending withdrawal by the Serbs on 
Sunday afternoon, U.N. spokesman Maj. Rob Annink said. But he noted that 
communications with the region were poor and that compliance could be achieved 
swiftly if the rebels are sincere.

AMERICAN ALBUM: DROUGHT, 'INVADER' TREES KILLING COTTONWOODS; THE GOVERNMENT 
AND RIO GRANDE VALLEY CITIZENS ARE JOINING FORCES TO CURB THE LOSS OF THE 
NATIVE BOSQUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HAEDERLE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On a late spring afternoon, the Rio Grande Nature Center offers a welcome 
respite from the heat and hassle of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Winding paths shaded by tall, graceful cottonwood trees lead to the banks of 
the river, muddy and swollen with snowmelt. A breeze wafts the sweet incense of 
Russian olive blossoms through feathery stands of tamarisk in the forest 
clearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in the Rio Grande bosque -- the world's largest cottonwood forest -- 
people and wildlife share a high-desert oasis. 
</P>
<P>
 But something is wrong with this picture. 
</P>
<P>
 All along the 160-mile Middle Rio Grande Valley, the native cottonwoods are 
failing to reproduce, steadily giving way to Russian olive and tamarisk trees 
-- aggressive, drought-tolerant plants from Eurasia that were introduced for 
erosion control early in the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts warn that within decades the cottonwoods will be overtaken by the 
invaders, and some native animal species are likely to vanish from the area as 
a result. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as the cottonwoods die out, there's going to be something there to 
replace them," said Anne Cully, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plant 
ecologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Cully and other biologists say the cottonwoods are declining because of lack 
of water. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the past 5 million years, melting snow in the southern Rocky 
Mountains fed spring floods that spread through the bosque and adjoining 
wetlands, scouring debris from the forest floor and replenishing soil 
nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
 When the floodwaters receded, patches of damp, bare earth lay ready for 
cottonwood seedlings to take root. 
</P>
<P>
 But flood-control and land-reclamation projects have drained thousands of 
acres of wetlands in the last 70 years and confined the once-meandering Rio 
Grande to a narrow, straightened channel. 
</P>
<P>
 As invader trees have crowded into forest clearings and the water table has 
dropped in the absence of flooding, suitable habitat for young cottonwoods has 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a growing consensus among valley residents and elected officials that 
something must be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.) has been a moving force from the start. 
Domenici, who grew up near the river, said he realized the seriousness of the 
bosque's plight only a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Domenici convened a citizens' task force, which pinpointed a 
number of political and technical problems. He also helped secure $1.4 million 
from the federal government for a study of the bosque by a team of government 
and university scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report last fall, the study team set forth 20 recommendations, chief of 
which was that upstream dam operators should mimic the river's natural flow by 
releasing enough water to flood the bosque each spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Cully, who helped write the study, says scientists understand that the dams, 
levees and irrigation ditches along the river will not be removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Every drop of the river's water is spoken for, destined for downstream 
farmers, the state of Texas and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, sundry agencies and political entities, each with a 
different mission, claim some authority over the river. 
</P>
<P>
 River-management changes must win support from the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers, the federal Bureau of Reclamation, the Fish and Wildlife Service, 
the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District (which delivers irrigation water to 
farmers), the city of Albuquerque and other communities and six Native American 
pueblos. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way things are now, letting out enough water for over-bank flooding to 
get some (natural) processes back is not going to be possible," Cully said. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, she said, scientists know the invader species are here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't really ever going to be able to get rid of salt cedar (tamarisk) 
and Russian olive," she said. "But we can try to prevent them from becoming the 
dominant species." 
</P>
<P>
 Albuquerque's Open Space Division, which administers the 5,000-acre Rio Grande 
Valley State Park, has re-established cottonwoods in areas that have been 
burned out or cleared of invader trees, says superintendent Rex Funk. 
</P>
<P>
 Funk says he hopes that current research into cottonwood regeneration -- 
including a program of controlled flooding at Bosque Del Apache National 
Wildlife Refuge near San Antonio, N.M. -- yields practical solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a state Bosque Management Task Force is recommending the creation 
of a new governmental entity to advocate on the behalf of the bosque in future 
river-management decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 This new body would probably be a management council made up of the interested 
communities and government agencies, said Laurence Lattmanm, chairman of the 
task force. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are groups that speak for various people," he said. "But no one speaks 
for the bosque."

FOILED BOMBERS OPEN FIRE, KILL 1 AT IRA FUND-RAISER

 Two gunmen opened fire while attempting to bomb a fund-raiser for IRA 
prisoners, killing one man and wounding another, police said Sunday. It was the 
first bombing attempt in Dublin since the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Police searched for the gunmen who left the 18-pound bomb, which failed to 
detonate. The Ulster Volunteer Force, an outlawed Protestant paramilitary group 
in Northern Ireland, claimed responsibility for the Saturday night attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had the device itself exploded, as was clearly intended, the entire pub and 
all of the occupants would have been blown up, including our own men at the 
scene," a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities identified the dead man as Martin Doherty, 35, of Dublin. The 
wounded man was identified as Patrick Burke, 29, also of Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were working as doormen at an event held to raise money for people 
imprisoned for IRA activities and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack came a day after the Irish Republican Army shot and killed an 
off-duty soldier in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

NEWS ANALYSIS; CRISIS IN CENTRAL AFRICA; BITTER TASTE OF 'REALISM' CAUSES ROW 
OVER U.N. PEACEKEEPING IN RWANDA; SECURITY COUNCIL: SOME MEMBERS ARE UPSET THAT 
U.S. PRESSURE DELAYED DISPATCH OF TROOPS TO WAR-TORN NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After their first encounter with the Clinton Administration's new policy 
directive on peacekeeping, several members of the U.N. Security Council feel 
bruised, chastened and somewhat angry. 
</P>
<P>
 The test case came last week when the council buckled under U.S. pressure and 
delayed the dispatch of 5,500 more troops to ravaged Rwanda. The Americans, 
explaining their reasons for the delay, cited the need for a realistic 
assessment of what can be done in that woeful Central African country. 
"Realism" is the touchstone of Presidential Policy Directive 25, or PPD25, as 
the directive is known in peacekeeping circles. 
</P>
<P>
 But the call for realism undermined ambassadors who believed in the greater 
need for an emotional, clarion outcry against genocide in Rwanda. "This was the 
wrong issue on which to test PPD25," said a European ambassador on the 
15-member Security Council. "There is a humanitarian disaster in Rwanda, and 
the members of the council wanted to go on record that they were ready to do 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 The council did pass a resolution authorizing some immediate help and possibly 
5,500 more troops later, but the resolution -- with its plethora of conditions 
-- did not resonate with the kind of commitment and dynamism that some 
ambassadors had wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials, however, were pleased with their handiwork. U.N. Ambassador 
Madeleine Albright, defending the toned-down resolution, told a House Foreign 
Affairs subcommittee a few hours later that "sending a U.N. force into the 
maelstrom of Rwanda without a sound plan of operations would be folly." 
</P>
<P>
 "Emotions can produce wonderful speeches and stirring Op-Ed pieces," she went 
on. "But emotions alone cannot produce policies that will achieve what they 
promise. If we do not keep commitments in line with capabilities, we will only 
further undermine U.N. credibility and support." 
</P>
<P>
 Some ambassadors were persuaded by this argument. A second European ambassador 
said that the first encounter with PPD25 had created "a bracing, sobering and 
beneficial impact on the council." But even this supporter acknowledged that 
U.S. diplomats had managed the resolution clumsily, needlessly offending some 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 New Zealand Ambassador Colin Keating and Nigerian Ambassador Ibrahim A. 
Gambari were obviously upset by the U.S. maneuvers. French Ambassador 
Jean-Bertrand Merimee also seemed troubled. Rumors circulated that a few others 
could not stifle their annoyance over what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue were the size and the operating plan for the U.N. mission in Rwanda. 
When a mysterious plane crash killed Rwanda's Hutu president April 6 and set 
off mass killing of the Tutsi minority and moderate Hutus, the United Nations 
had 2,500 peacekeeping troops in Rwanda. Their job was mainly to supervise a 
cease-fire between the Hutu-dominated government army and the Tutsi-dominated 
rebel force known as the Rwandan Patriotic Front. Under a peace agreement, this 
cease-fire was supposed to lead to national elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first hours of violence, 10 Belgian peacekeeping troops were 
slaughtered when they tried in vain to save the moderate Hutu prime minister 
from execution by marauding Rwandan troops. The Belgian government quickly 
pulled its troops out of Rwanda and helped persuade the Security Council that 
it was futile to keep a large peacekeeping force there. The council cut the 
force drastically, ordering it to do no more than try to mediate a cease-fire, 
observe what was going on and supervise humanitarian relief if possible. By 
mid-May, there were only 450 U.N. soldiers there. 
</P>
<P>
 As the horrendous killings mounted, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali 
called on the Security Council to change course and dispatch an enlarged force 
of at least 5,500 peacekeepers to deal with the nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 But on May 5, President Clinton signed PPD25 -- the Administration's new 
policy on peacekeeping. Kneaded by U.S. officials for more than a year, this 
policy pledged the United States to ask tough questions before taking part or 
even approving any U.N. peacekeeping mission. Rwanda called PPD25 into action 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali proposed that the peacekeepers land at Kigali's airport in the 
center of the country and fan out from there to assist humanitarian relief and 
to deter attacks on civilians who had fled their homes. But Albright objected 
to this plan during closed-door meetings of the council, saying that the United 
States favored sending U.N. troops in smaller numbers to the refugee camps just 
inside the Rwandan borders. She called this approach "less complex" and derided 
the idea of launching a U.N. operation "through an airport at the epicenter of 
a civil war." She said that chances for success were slim with Boutros-Ghali's 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of this, she said she doubted whether the secretary general could 
persuade governments to give him enough troops. The United States itself would 
provide logistics support if the mission was worthwhile -- but no troops. 
</P>
<P>
 The council thus had to wrestle with two military approaches, which were 
quickly dubbed the American "outside-in" plan and the secretary general's 
"inside-out" plan. As a compromise, Nigeria's Gambari, who is serving as 
president of the council this month, proposed a resolution that simply 
authorized a force and left it up to the commanders in the field to decide 
whether it made more sense to start from Kigali or the borders. After all, he 
argued, none of the ambassadors has a military background. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 13, the 15 members of the council, including the United States, seemed 
close to accepting the Gambari compromise. But the U.S. delegation still had 
questions about it, and the ambassadors decided to consult their capitals over 
the following weekend before voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Monday, the U.S. delegation returned with a host of doubts about the 
resolution and a new proposal: The Security Council should vote only to augment 
the current force to 800 and to return 150 military observers who had been 
evacuated to Nairobi, Kenya. A larger peacekeeping operation could be discussed 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 This surprised most of the ambassadors and infuriated some. "We had to have a 
resolution that the newspapers would say authorized 5,500 troops," an angry 
European ambassador said later. After hours of wrangling, the council finally 
voted after midnight in favor of a new compromise resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution dispatched the small numbers that the Americans had proposed 
but approved in principle a future force of 5,500. But these troops would go to 
Rwanda only if the secretary general satisfied the council -- particularly the 
United States, with its power of veto -- that the two belligerents would 
cooperate with the United Nations, that a cease-fire was in sight, that troops 
were available, that the mission would last only a short time and that "the 
concept of operations" (either inside-out or outside-in) was acceptable. In 
short, Albright had pressured the Security Council into asking the tough 
questions that PPD25 said must be asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the resolution was adopted unanimously, the vote reflected bitter 
division. "I cannot conceal my delegation's disappointment that this resolution 
only approves a very modest first phase," New Zealand's Keating told the 
council. "This resolution stops short of what is really necessary . . . the 
commitment of the council to an operation that would make a start at the task 
of protecting civilians at risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Some ambassadors were obviously irritated over the pressure to mold their 
resolution to fit PPD25. "We cannot have one member of the council deciding 
that all peacekeeping operations must follow its agenda," the angry European 
ambassador said. "What if the Russians decided to do that? Or China? What if 
one country decides to veto all peacekeeping missions that have to do with 
human rights? We cannot have that." 
</P>
<P>
 But Albright insisted that most of the ambassadors welcomed the exercise. "I 
think the other members of the Security Council are appreciative of the 
guidelines that we are setting, creating some kind of rationale for which 
peacekeeping operations are doable and which ones are pie in the sky," she told 
a television interviewer a few days later.

<P>
 Rebels captured strategic positions Sunday in their drive to take Rwanda's 
capital, overrunning the international airport and a nearby military base 
outside Kigali as government troops fled. 
</P>
<P>
 After weeks of ferocious fighting, the momentum swung decisively in favor of 
the Rwandan Patriotic Front, which could use the two important posts on the 
western outskirts of the capital to launch new assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 The capital's airport -- which the rebels took hours before seizing the key 
Kanombe army barracks -- is the devastated city's main lifeline for urgently 
needed relief supplies, but it remains closed to U.N. reinforcements or 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows when it will be safe to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebels have said they would welcome a resumption of U.N. relief flights, but 
U.N. officials were still trying Sunday to negotiate a deal with both warring 
parties for uninterrupted use of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still need an agreement from both sides because our planes would still 
have to fly over areas controlled by government troops," said Maj. Jean-Guy 
Plante, a U.N. spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Government troops "still have a capability to bring down our planes," said 
Abdul Kabia, a U.N. spokesman in Kigali. "When they moved out of Kanombe, they 
took antiaircraft guns with them." 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations also hopes to use the airport as a staging area for 5,500 
new peacekeepers authorized by the Security Council last week. If it can't, 
officials said they would have to find an alternate site. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels are predominantly members of the minority Tutsi tribe, while the 
majority Hutus control the government and the military. The bloodletting began 
a day after President Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundi President Cyprian 
Ntayamira -- both Hutus -- were killed in a suspicious plane crash in Kigali on 
April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hutu presidential guard, some army units and gangs organized by extreme 
Hutu politicians slaughtered mostly Tutsi civilians and Hutus considered 
government opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 200,000 people are estimated to have died in massacres that quickly 
spread throughout the mountainous country. 
</P>
<P>
 Government forces offered little resistance Sunday to the assault on the 
airport, U.N. spokesman Kabia said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rebels came running from all directions, and the soldiers just vanished," 
another U.N. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Rwandan army Chief of Staff Gen. Augustin Bizimungu said his troops evacuated 
the airport and the barracks at the United Nations' request. He denied that the 
airport and barracks were "captured." 
</P>
<P>
 "We shall organize ourselves and continue fighting," he told French radio. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials said they doubted that the rebels would try to take the city's 
downtown, swarming with armed militiamen backing the army. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Brig. Gen. Romeo Dallaire, the Canadian U.N. military 
commander, had arranged a truce to allow a visit today by special U.N. envoy 
Iqbal Riza. 
</P>
<P>
 Riza plans to discuss with the warring parties the deployment of the new, 
largely African peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
 "Government and rebel forces have agreed to a truce while U.N. envoys are in 
the country," Dallaire said. "Let's hope they obey it." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. spokesman Plante said the whereabouts of three government battalions from 
the Kanombe camp was unknown, "and the possibility of them regrouping for a 
counterattack cannot be ruled out." 
</P>
<P>
 Plante said the United Nations was also trying to decide what to do with an 
estimated 1,600 civilians, mainly women and children, who fled the Kanombe 
military camp and had gathered without food at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in neighboring Uganda on Sunday declared that three districts 
bordering Lake Victoria were disaster areas because of the danger posed by 
thousands of corpses that have floated downriver from Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio Uganda said 10,000 to 40,000 corpses have floated into Lake Victoria 
from the Kagera River, which has its source in Rwanda's highlands. It said the 
government had appealed for international help in disposing of the bodies. Many 
bodies appeared to be mutilated, and some were bound.

FAMILY AND FRIENDS GATHER AT THE ONASSIS APARTMENT FOR WAKE; TRIBUTE: PRAYERS 
ARE ALSO SAID AT HER N.Y. NEIGHBORHOOD CHURCH. FUNERAL AND BURIAL TO BE HELD 
TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the small neighborhood church where she regularly attended Mass, simple 
prayers were said Sunday for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. 
</P>
<P>
 Her name was included in the list of parishioners who had passed away during 
the week, fitting tribute to the privacy one of the world's best known women 
almost constantly sought. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a symbol for the world," said the Right Rev. George F. Bardes as he 
stood on the sidewalk after Mass at the Church of St. Thomas More, a house of 
worship tucked away between towering apartment buildings just a few blocks from 
Mrs. Onassis' spacious apartment on 5th Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Bardes said the widow of President John F. Kennedy was a religious woman who 
sometimes came to the church to pray alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stresses of her life were monumental," he said. ". . . She almost had to 
be religious." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Mrs. Onassis held a memorial service for her slain husband in the 
church each year. She would be joined by their children, John F. Kennedy Jr. 
and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Bardes traveled to Mrs. Onassis' apartment to give her the last 
rites. He said that as he left the apartment, he was happy and relieved, not 
only because he had been able to offer comfort but because the family was 
"doing exactly as Mrs. Kennedy had hoped they would do." 
</P>
<P>
 Hours later, at the age of 64, she died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of 
the lymphatic system. 
</P>
<P>
 The serenity of Sunday Mass amid the altar flowers and stained-glass windows 
of St. Thomas More contrasted starkly with preparations under way five blocks 
away at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, where the funeral service will be 
held at 7 a.m. PDT (10 a.m. EDT) today, and at Arlington National Cemetery in 
Virginia, where Mrs. Onassis will be buried alongside President Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton planned to speak at the burial service, but only First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton will attend the funeral because Clinton's attendance 
would conflict with the family's wish to keep the service private, a White 
House spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Retired Archbishop Philip M. Hannan of New Orleans will lead the Arlington 
service, officials said, and the Navy Sea Canters Chorus will sing. 
</P>
<P>
 In St. Ignatius Loyola, designated a landmark because of its Italian 
Renaissance architecture, Mrs. Onassis was baptized and confirmed. If 
parishioners look carefully as they walk down the marble center aisle, they 
will notice a small bronze plaque at row 62. 
</P>
<P>
 It notes that on Feb. 10, 1963, "John F. Kennedy 35th President attended Mass 
in this pew." 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to escape pressure and grief, John F. Kennedy Jr. and his companion, 
actress Daryl Hannah, roller-skated past the church on Sunday, startling 
photographers. Hours later, the pair and Caroline Schlossberg joined other 
family members and friends for a wake in Mrs. Onassis' apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Bardes led the service. He told reporters that the mood in the apartment had 
been "prayerful." 
</P>
<P>
 Both children plan to speak at their mother's funeral. Their uncle, Sen. 
Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), will deliver the main eulogy. Movie director Mike 
Nichols and Maurice Tempelsman, the longtime companion of the former First 
Lady, will also speak at the church, which seats about 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Large crowds continued to gather outside Mrs. Onassis' graystone apartment 
building, which has become a magnet for the curious and those people seeking to 
pay tribute to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourist buses paused in front of the building, while spectators filled the 
sidewalks and sat on a wall of Central Park, just across the street. Many in 
the crowd brought cameras -- and memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's the best lady in New York," said Rosa Ocasio, as she stood behind a 
police barrier. "My first vote, in 1960, was for John F. Kennedy." 
</P>
<P>
 "We just thought we should come by," said Barbara Domings, a nurse who lived 
in Massachusetts for a time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the Kennedys have been with us since we were little. It's a corner 
turning. . . . It's the end of something." Rites on Television 
</P>

 Services and burial for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis are private, but the 
networks plan special coverage.

DOLE ACCUSED OF USING HEALTH CARE FOR WHITE HOUSE BID; REFORM: ROCKEFELLER 
CRITICIZES SENATE GOP LEADER'S OPPOSITION TO PACKAGE AS POLITICAL. CHAFEE SAYS 
HIS CHARGES ARE 'BIZARRE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A health care debate between leading Republican and Democratic senators grew 
sharply partisan Sunday as Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.) accused 
Senate GOP leader Bob Dole of Kansas of opposing reform in order to advance his 
presidential ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, I think Bob Dole is really a major problem here. He wants to be 
President in '96," said Rockefeller, who is President Clinton's staunchest 
congressional ally on health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockefeller also accused other, unnamed Republicans of "stalling and saying 
no" to all Democratic overtures on a number of key compromises. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole was not present during the debate on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press," but 
panelist Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.) dismissed Rockefeller's charges as "a 
little bizarre" and derided the West Virginian as "captain of the Titanic." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole spokesman Clarkson Hine said after the program that the senator "is 
working for health care reform that can win broad bipartisan support, not 
something that creates a gigantic government bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Rockefeller's exchange with Chafee was noteworthy on several scores. 
</P>
<P>
 It reflected the growing frustration among many Democrats in Congress -- and 
the Administration -- at the snail-like legislative pace on what they hope will 
be the centerpiece of Clinton's first term. It now seems all but certain that 
no committee in the House or Senate will be able to report out a bill by the 
end of this week, when Congress begins a Memorial Day recess. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, such harsh words -- and in so public a forum -- cast doubt on whether 
genuine bipartisanship on the issue can prevail, as nearly everyone in both 
parties has preached. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the partisan accusations provided a glimpse of the rancor and 
recriminations that undoubtedly will mar the fall congressional campaign if 
Congress adjourns without enacting health reform this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chafee-Rockefeller exchange also served as a reminder of the utterly 
unpredictable course that health care reform legislation will continue to take, 
with many twists and turns in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last Thursday, many were elated when the Senate Labor and Human Resources 
Committee unanimously approved a compromise on cost-containment as all seven of 
the panel's Republicans joined with the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 But only a day later, the Republican National Committee unveiled a $500,000 
national television ad campaign -- featuring Dole, among others -- attacking 
Clinton's reform agenda as a "government-run" system that was too ambitious. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharp words between Chafee and Rockefeller, both members of the key Senate 
Finance Committee, were surprising in part because Chafee, perhaps more than 
any other Republican senator, is a longtime champion of health care reform, as 
is Rockefeller among the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 And Chafee agrees with Clinton and Rockefeller that serious health care reform 
must mean coverage for the estimated 38 million uninsured Americans. But Chafee 
would accomplish that goal much more slowly, relying on a government 
requirement that all individuals must buy insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton proposes to achieve universal coverage through an 
employer-and-individual mandate, requiring all employers to pay at least 80% of 
a worker's premiums, with the individual paying the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole in the last two years has often changed his position on health care 
reform. Early on, he favored comprehensive reform. Then he backed off, saying 
there was no health care crisis. He has also been a co-sponsor of Chafee's 
bill, but now says Congress should not pass a bill with any mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Chafee insisted Sunday that Dole "is deeply concerned" about health 
care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rockefeller was not convinced. "We're reaching out to Republicans. And I 
think he's one of the problems that we're running into -- obstructionism from 
the Republican Party." 
</P>
<P>
 Chafee denied that Republicans were "dragging their feet," noting that it was 
Democrats who control the congressional committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the partisan bickering, both Chafee and Rockefeller said Congress is 
still likely to enact health care reform legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm confident that when all is said and done, the final bill that passes will 
look much more like our bill than any other bill," Chafee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockefeller added: "I think we're going to get a bill, but I think we're only 
going to get a bill if the Republicans stop stalling and saying no to 
everything."

SELF-DEFENSE TRAINING PAYS OFF FOR COUPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After fighting off two bandits who tried to rob them at gunpoint, a San 
Fernando Valley couple gave credit to a self-defense course they took two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was able to get ahold of the gun hand that was hitting me, I was able 
to defend myself a little bit," the man told The Times. He asked that his name 
and his wife's not be used; the robbers have not been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was funny, it was like everything was going in slow motion, and the things 
I was taught almost two years ago were coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday evening, the man and woman, both 40, were leaving a Tarzana 
restaurant where they had dined with two friends after seeing a movie. As they 
strolled to a parking lot, the robbers pounced, said Los Angeles Police Officer 
Sandra Castello. 
</P>
<P>
 As one couple watched from only a few feet away, the robbers walked up behind 
the other couple. One held a gun on the man while the second tried to take the 
woman's purse, said the male victim. 
</P>
<P>
 But the woman, who had also taken training classes for such encounters, held 
onto her purse and kneed the assailant in the groin, Castello said. Seeing the 
scuffle, the armed bandit started pistol-whipping the husband, striking him at 
least five times, Castello said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what was going on until the guy hit me three or four times," 
the victim said. 
</P>
<P>
 He fended off the gunman's weapon with one hand and hit him with the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, their friends had retreated about 30 yards away behind a parked car 
and called 911 on a portable phone, the man said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bandits gave up the attack and fled to a waiting parked car. 
</P>
<P>
 Both victims were taken to the Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical Center, where 
they were treated and released early Sunday. The man suffered cuts on his head 
that required stitches, authorities said. His wife was unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be calling them on Monday to sign up" for another course, he said of the 
self-defense classes the couple took.

EMPLOYEES SAY THEY WERE SHOCKED BY COLLAPSE OF FIRST PENSION CORP.; FINANCE: 
THE SEC CHARGES THAT THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPALS ENTICED INVESTORS TO PUT MONEY IN 
MORTGAGES THAT DID NOT EXIST. BUSINESS RECORDS WERE A MAZE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It was midafternoon on April 21 when the shaken employees of First Pension 
Corp. gathered around company Chairman William E. Cooper, who was standing 
nervously in his coat and tie in the middle of the company's headquarters here. 
</P>
<P>
 Shellshocked from answering nonstop phone calls from angry investors demanding 
their pension money, the employees, some with eyes red from crying, waited in 
the top-floor offices of their two-story building to hear Cooper's explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees were especially alarmed that day by the sight of several cars across 
the street quickly being loaded with computers, boxes and other documents from 
their parent company, First Diversified Financial Services. 
</P>
<P>
 With his voice choking at times from emotion and tears welling in his eyes, 
Cooper told the 20 employees, almost all women, that although it hurt him, and 
it was the hardest thing he'd ever done in his 30 years in the mortgage 
business, he was filing to place the company into bankruptcy. Then he handed 
out paychecks, all of which later bounced, and left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I think about what he said that day, and it's laughable," said one 
former employee. "We just had no idea what was going on. I wish I could've 
smashed him in the face." 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension, with an estimated 8,000 clients and accounts valued at $350 
million, declared bankruptcy April 22, the day after Cooper met with employees 
and one day after Colorado state authorities seized Summit Trust Services, a 
Denver-based firm established by Cooper to manage clients' money. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 13, the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that the three 
company principals, prominent Orange County businessman Cooper and his two 
longtime associates, Robert E. Lindley and Valerie Jensen, ran a scheme that 
used money from later investors to pay dividends to earlier ones. The myriad of 
companies run by the threesome allegedly enticed investors to put money in 
mortgages that did not exist with promises of annual dividends of up to 28%. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the First Pension offices -- in a small office park near John Wayne 
Airport -- were dark, with the doors locked, the parking lot empty and the 
grass needing mowing. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC documents and interviews with numerous former employees reveal that many 
workers at First Pension and sister company Vestcorp Securities Inc. were 
unaware that they may have been participating in what could be one of Orange 
County's most elaborate pyramid schemes, with possibly as much as $124 million 
of investors' money lost to fraud or theft. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never even dreamed that these mortgage pools did not have underlying 
assets," said Ana Maritza Golan, former operations manager at First Pension. 
"Not at any point. Even the brokers at Vestcorp didn't know -- one of them had 
$250,000 of his own money in the pools. We were all taken." 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension acted as a pension fund administrator, serving people who wanted 
to make choices about where to invest their individual retirement accounts, 
Keogh accounts or other retirement savings. Many of its customers were 
persuaded to put at least some of their money into the real estate pools by 
brokers at Vestcorp, which marketed the partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 Although several former First Pension employees said they became concerned 
about the company when Jensen, its president, abruptly resigned on April 5 
citing job stress, they did not suspect the company was in trouble. Even during 
the final week of operations, employees said they were "still trying to do 
their jobs," administering pension plans and pitching the latest limited 
partnership investments to investors. 
</P>
<P>
 But by Thursday, April 21, employees began to believe that something was 
terribly wrong. The switchboard was ablaze with calls; several investors were 
threatening to come down to the office and physically take their money back. 
Some investors had already heard about the Summit seizure, while others were 
upset at learning that pension fund checks they had mailed to First Pension had 
been cashed, but the monies never credited to their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the employees were sitting at their desks saying, 'I just can't take 
another call,' " remembers one employee. Managers decided to lock the doors 
about noon, shut down the switchboard and send everyone to lunch. Then they 
called Cooper, who usually worked across the street at parent company First 
Diversified. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were looking to each other for support. The rumor mill was rampant, 
with people saying, 'Oh, this investor told me this,' or 'I heard this,' " a 
former employee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbi Settle, a pension consultant in First Pension's San Diego office, said 
it wasn't until that Thursday that she knew something was seriously wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rumor was embezzlement of funds and we heard it was a substantial 
amount," said Settle, who said she is owed about $10,000 in back salary and 
commissions. "My heart just stopped when someone told me. I couldn't do any 
work after that." 
</P>
<P>
 In the days after the SEC's allegations, probably the most asked question by 
observers, investors and even employees is: "How could this have happened?" 
</P>
<P>
 Those in the best position to know -- principals Cooper, Lindley and Jensen -- 
aren't talking. None have spoken publicly. In response to SEC questioning, 
Lindley and Jensen refused to answer all queries, repeatedly invoking the 5th 
Amendment. Cooper refused to appear at all. Lawyers for the three principals 
say they are all intent on cooperating with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodger Rusch, former president of Vestcorp, told the SEC on May 10 that he 
knew as far back as 1989 that the trust deeds were not registered. That year, 
prompted by increasing concerns about the partnerships, he went to a local 
Orange County title company and asked what it would cost to run a title search 
on real estate partnerships being marketed by Vestcorp. 
</P>
<P>
 "They called me back an hour later and said we won't charge you anything 
because there's none," Rusch said in SEC testimony. "There isn't a single thing 
recorded in these partnership names. My heart went to my throat." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper tried to reassure Rusch in 1989, telling him that the registration 
costs, about $10 per deed, were prohibitive. Although Cooper was a man who 
claimed he had made about 14,500 loans valued at more than $390 million, he 
told Rusch it was economical not to register the deeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Cooper . . . would, you know, stonewall, he would intimidate, he would do 
all the things" to keep things private, said Rusch, who quit in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper tried to control the mail coming into and out of the First Pension 
office during late March and April, the same time when tax deadlines meant 
pension contributions would be at their peak, the SEC said. During that time an 
unknown number of clients' checks disappeared, many of which were deposited in 
other bank accounts opened by Cooper and Lindley, according to the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
 In SEC testimony, employee Tracy Reiter said she told Cooper that distribution 
checks prepared to be sent out around April 2, many of which were used to pay 
clients' living expenses, were not being delivered. Cooper blamed it on "our 
damn postal service," Reiter told the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony gathered by the SEC reveals that Cooper's companies were a financial 
"maze" and show that computer transactions transferring money from various 
accounts were mysteriously deleted and that parent company First Diversified 
was sending packages to Rarotonga, Cook Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more unbelievable was the annual meeting purportedly held by the board of 
directors of Summit Trust, a company created by Cooper to manage client funds. 
When the board gathered Feb. 10, the minutes show, they met at 27068 S. La Paz 
Ave., Suite 426 in Aliso Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 That happens to be the address of a Mailboxes Etc. location; and No. 426 is 
the registered postal box for the company. The minutes show only Cooper and 
partner Lindley attended the meeting.

 The younger brother of a man accused of killing 14 women surrendered here, two 
days after a warrant was issued for his arrest in the alleged molestation of a 
teen-age girl, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Edward Suff, 38, surrendered to San Bernardino County sheriff's 
deputies outside his mother's house in this mountain resort town Saturday 
morning, dispatcher Joanna Shurzinske said. 
</P>
<P>
 Suff was in custody at the Riverside County jail on a $1-million bail arrest 
warrant, said Riverside police Sgt. Al Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Suff molested a 13-year-old girl on at least two occasions. 
Authorities also alleged that Suff failed to register as a sex offender. Court 
records show he was arrested for lewd and lascivious conduct in 1982 and was 
convicted of rape in 1982 and sexual battery in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 His elder brother, William, was arrested in 1992 and charged with killing 14 
women.

SCREENING ROOM; ASIAN PACIFIC FEST CONTINUES WITH SOLID OFFERINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The UCLA Film Archive and Visual Communications' ninth annual Los Angeles 
Asian Pacific Film and Video Festival continues with a rich array of offerings 
at various venues -- what follows is but a sampling. 
</P>
<P>
 Riyad Wadia's 75-minute "Fearless Nadia, the Hunterwali" (7 tonight at the 
Grande) is a charming portrait of his great-aunt, born Mary Evans in Australian 
in 1910, who in the '30s became the singing and dancing stunt-performing 
superwoman of the Hindi-speaking cinema. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 80 years, the glittery Vegas-like Takarazuka Revue has attracted 
rabid female fans, and Kim Longinotti and Jano Williams' delightful "Dream 
Girls" (9 tonight at the Grande) reveals why: The young women who play the male 
roles in the show possess a sensitivity and romanticism Japanese women find 
lacking in men in real life. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar-winning Stirling Silliphant co-wrote Chatri Chalerm Yukol's "Salween" (9 
p.m. Tuesday at UCLA Melnitz), a powerful epic melodrama set in a corrupt, 
seedy border town on the Thailand side of the Salween River, which divides that 
country from Burma and which borders on the world's biggest teak forests. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the skirmishing of a new wet-behind-the-ears police chief and a macho 
veteran sergeant, we view the tragic struggle of the minority Karen people 
against the oppressive Burmese majority, which has led to ruthless Thai arms 
merchants trading guns to both sides for teak, depleting the forests. 
</P>
<P>
 Documentarian Pratibha Parmar's sensitive yet witty "Double the Trouble, Twice 
the Fun" (8 p.m. Tuesday at Hollywood Moguls, 650 N. Hudson) introduces us to a 
world of humorous disabled British lesbians and gays who are defying the cult 
of the body beautiful that enslaves many gays, especially men. 
</P>
<P>
 It's amazing that an uncompromising film like Im Kwon-Taek's "Sopyonje" (7 
p.m. Thursday at the Grande) can become Korea's biggest box-office hit ever. A 
stark tale, spanning 1945 to the early '70s -- when pansori , plaintive 
traditional folk chants, were displaced by Western pop -- it tells of a 
hard-drinking, hard-driving master of that form of music who wanders the 
countryside with his two foster children. As painful as it is profound, from 
Korea's greatest filmmaker, "Sopyonje" reveals the virtually limitless 
sacrifices an art form can demand of its practitioners.  
</P>
<P>
 Takeshi Kitano's stylish "Sonatine" (7 p.m. Thursday at Melnitz) is a droll, 
deadpan -- and ultimately romantic -- gangster movie, every bit as much an 
auteur work as a Jean-Pierre Melville underworld film. Kitano also stars, under 
his stage name "Beat" Takeshi, as a tough, burly Tokyo mobster dispatched by 
his boss to Okinawa along with several henchmen to help out an affiliated gang 
deal with rivals -- only to discover that it's a setup. Kitano has a driving, 
laconic visual style that never lags. 
</P>
<P>
 Park Kwang-Su's "To the Starry Land" (Saturday, 2 p.m. at the Pacific Asia 
Museum, 46 N. Robles, Pasadena, and UCLA Melnitz at 9 p.m.) seems indubitably a 
masterpiece, a beautifully wrought tale of betrayal and reconciliation. A 
middle-aged businessman, accompanied by his lifelong friend, a poet, return to 
their native island to bury the businessman's father only to be confronted with 
the islanders' fierce opposition. Flashbacks catch us up in a harsh but healthy 
and largely happy existence destroyed by the Korean War -- and reveal why the 
man's burial is so vehemently opposed four decades after his departure. 
</P>
<P>
 Clara Law's "Temptation of a Monk" (7 p.m. Sunday at Melnitz), the festival's 
closing attraction, is an arty- as- all- get- out spiritual odyssey about a 
young Tang Dynasty general (Wu Hsin-Kuo) who betrays his crown prince for the 
good of the country only to find himself consumed with guilt, which leads to a 
long, bloody and lurid road to redemption.

DILEMMAS OF THE DEAF; SCHOOL CHOICES COMPLEX FOR THE HEARING-IMPAIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sharon Groeneveld had suspected for months that her daughter, Luisa, had a 
hearing problem. 
</P>
<P>
 And the suspicion grew the day that Groeneveld walked into a room where Luisa, 
then 9 months old, was sitting in a crib facing away from the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had her back to me and I talked to her all the way to the crib," 
Groeneveld said. "Then I touched her and it about sent her through the ceiling. 
She did not hear me at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The family's doctor downplayed Groeneveld's fears, assuring her that Luisa was 
merely developing slowly. But several months later, the Ventura mother had her 
daughter's hearing tested anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 The test showed that Luisa was deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that year, when Luisa was not quite 2 years old, her parents enrolled 
her at Loma Vista School in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no time to waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Because more than 90% of deaf children are born to hearing parents who have no 
knowledge of sign language, families depend on schools not only to teach their 
deaf children academic and social skills, but also the rudiments of language. 
</P>
<P>
 Although deaf children need more from the schools than hearing students, they 
often come away with less. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the United States, deaf students graduate from high school with a 
median reading level equivalent to hearing fourth-graders, even though the deaf 
have the same rates of intelligence as the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with this reality, many parents try hard to help their deaf children 
beat the odds. That means not only getting their children into school as early 
as possible, but choosing where to send them. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, some parents send their youngsters to the California School 
for the Deaf at Riverside. Others put their children on Metrolink each morning 
to attend an acclaimed day school for the deaf in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Groenevelds, like most families, send their deaf children to the local 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 For parents, the choice of school often depends less on academics than on 
whether they want their children to learn to speak or to rely primarily on sign 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 "What mode of communication that family chooses will determine what 
educational setting that child needs," said Zibby Bayarsky, spokeswoman for the 
Riverside school. 
</P>
<P>
 Most schools for the deaf now teach both speech and sign, but at residential 
schools such as the one in Riverside, students may be more apt to become fluent 
in sign and to rely on it as their language of choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike deaf students at local schools who go home to hearing families that may 
know little or no sign, children at residential schools are immersed in the 
world of the deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is one argument some parents and school officials use against sending 
children to those schools. Deaf children need to stay with their families, the 
argument goes, and they need to adjust to living in a hearing world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal here is to have these kids associate with the hearing kids," said 
Ricardo Nargi, special education director for the Ventura Unified School 
District, "because that's the world they're going to be living in." 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, deaf children from Camarillo and the east county are bused 
to Simi Elementary and Valley View Junior High schools in Simi Valley. 
Youngsters from the west county are sent to Loma Vista, Elmhurst and Cabrillo 
Middle schools in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 And deaf high school students from throughout the county are eligible to 
attend Rio Mesa High School in Oxnard, although some choose to stay in their 
local districts. 
</P>
<P>
 To help deaf children overcome their natural delay in learning language, Simi 
Elementary in Simi Valley accepts deaf students as young as 3 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura, Loma Vista enrolls children as young 18 months. The Ventura 
Unified School District even sends teachers to the homes of children younger 
than 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Learning to talk is a difficult proposition for deaf children because they 
cannot mimic the speech of others as hearing children do. Even if deaf children 
are lucky enough to be able to hear some sounds with the help of a hearing aid, 
they need training to distinguish what those sounds are. 
</P>
<P>
 But most hearing parents of the deaf want their children to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a hearing parent of a deaf child, that's what you want most is for them 
to talk," Sharon Groeneveld said. "It's only natural you want them to 
communicate how you do." 
</P>
<P>
 Groeneveld's daughter Luisa, now 3, uses her voice, but her high-pitched yelps 
are mostly unintelligible. Luisa can pronounce about five words, including papa 
and bye-bye. An average hearing child of Luisa's age can say 900 words. 
</P>
<P>
 As Luisa tries to master speech, her teachers at Loma Vista School are helping 
her communicate and name things in the world around her through sign. 
</P>
<P>
 And Luisa's parents are learning to sign, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Loma Vista and Simi Elementary offer free weekly sign language classes to 
hearing families. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important people in the deaf child's life are the family," Simi 
Elementary teacher Vickie Tomastik said. "We owe it to the family to help the 
family learn to sign to communicate with their child." 
</P>
<P>
 Such support and sign language instruction may be especially critical for 
Spanish-speaking families, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the roughly 200 deaf children and teen-agers in Ventura County, more than 
half have Spanish-speaking parents. Because the students learn only English and 
sign language at school, their parents rely mainly on sign for even the most 
basic communication with their children. 
</P>
<P>
 When Anna and Roberto Cervantes moved to Oxnard two years ago from Mexico, 
their two deaf sons, Ivan and Roberto, were 4 and 6 years old, respectively. 
Neither had been to school. 
</P>
<P>
 The two boys communicated with each other through their own made-up signs, but 
the parents struggled with disciplining the children and with understanding 
their needs, Anna Cervantes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roberto would want water," she said in Spanish. "But he did not know how to 
say water." So the boy would pull his mother toward the sink. 
</P>
<P>
 Cervantes and her husband began taking evening sign language classes at Loma 
Vista when they enrolled Roberto and Ivan in school. 
</P>
<P>
 And on a recent afternoon in the family's living room, Anna Cervantes nodded 
her head comprehendingly when Ivan, now 6, signed to his mother that the fish 
in the family's aquarium had eaten. 
</P>
<P>
 "We communicate more," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to offering sign language classes to families, Loma Vista and some 
of the county's other public schools teach such classes to hearing students. 
</P>
<P>
 The sign classes for elementary students are generally taught on a sporadic 
basis by volunteers. But at Rio Mesa High, which has about 14 deaf students 
among its enrollment of 2,000, a teacher from Oxnard Adult School has been 
coming to the campus for years to teach two sign language classes a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students in those classes said they wish that more Rio Mesa students knew 
sign so that their deaf classmates had more people to talk to. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hardly anyone knows sign besides us," 15-year-old Rose Vanoni said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rio Mesa is in danger of losing its sign language classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Eric Ortega said the state has recently ruled against Rio Mesa using 
an adult education teacher for high school classes, forcing officials to 
scramble to find a way to continue the sign language instruction next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides offering sign classes to hearing students, Rio Mesa and other local 
public schools with deaf children seek to integrate the deaf by putting them 
into regular classes. 
</P>
<P>
 In hearing classes at Rio Mesa, a sign language interpreter translates 
everything the teacher says. And hearing students are assigned to take notes 
for their deaf classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such efforts to accommodate the deaf, some parents say deaf students 
at Rio Mesa and other local public schools are still too isolated. 
</P>
<P>
 Durston and Gayle Winesburg decided to send their daughter, Shanna, to 
Riverside when she turned 12 two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though sending their daughter away was heartbreaking, Gayle Winesburg 
said, the family believes that when deaf children reach junior high, they need 
to be with other deaf people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Winesburgs speak from experience. They are both deaf, and Durston attended 
residential schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It starts in middle school," Gayle Winesburg said. "Deaf people tend to stay 
with deaf people." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, even though Shanna speaks fluently and reads lips well enough to 
converse with hearing people, she said she finds it easier to be with the deaf 
rather than with the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just get tired of looking at them and reading their lips," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Riverside school, Shanna is with 500 other deaf students from around 
Southern California. At Valley View Junior High, the public school she would be 
attending, there are only six deaf students. 
</P>
<P>
 And, at the Riverside school, her father said, Shanna has deaf adults as role 
models -- counselors, teachers, coaches, administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one of the public school teachers for the deaf in Ventura County is deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Winesburgs, Peggy Tranovich of Camarillo decided to transfer her son, 
Jamie, out of the local public schools when he reached middle school. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of sending him to Riverside, she chose Tri-Pod School for the deaf 
in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Tri-Pod -- which primarily serves the Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena areas -- 
has an equal number of deaf and hearing students. Ten are from Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 All of Tri-Pod's hearing students -- most of whom have deaf parents, brothers 
or sisters -- are exposed to sign language, and all of the classes are 
team-taught by one teacher for the hearing and one for the deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 One advantage of such a school, said Tranovich, who volunteers for national 
deaf advocacy groups, is that all of the teachers and administrators understand 
the special needs of the deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have someone to talk to about deafness," she said. "I don't have to go to a 
principal and tell him what my child's needs are, what his problems in a 
regular-education classroom are. We can really discuss the problem from a 
knowledgeable perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, deaf students typically have more access to academic, 
extracurricular and social opportunities when they attend schools that are 
geared to the hearing-impaired, said Tranovich and other advocates for the 
deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 Most deaf children, for example, do not participate in Little League or other 
organized sports when they are young, which puts them at a disadvantage when 
they try out for teams at a hearing high school, said Coleen Ashly, spokeswoman 
for the Greater Los Angeles Area Assn. for the Deaf's tri-county chapter, which 
is based in Ventura. "The kids on high school teams have played sports all 
their lives," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when deaf students at local public schools are put into hearing classes, 
they are marked as different by having to sit in a front row seat and use a 
sign language interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because you have deaf children on a regular campus doesn't mean they're 
integrated," Tranovich said. "You have teachers, administrators and children 
who don't know anything about deafness, who don't understand deafness, who 
can't communicate with a deaf child." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than integrate the child, she said, "it isolates the child." 
</P>
<P>
 And because the classroom interpreter translates only the conversation between 
the teacher and students, the deaf miss out on everything else -- the 
opportunity to ask a classmate about homework, the casual social interactions, 
the whispered wisecracks. 
</P>
<P>
 At Rio Mesa, deaf students such as Jessica Lechuga and Alex Reynoso said they 
have both hearing and deaf friends. They belong to a club of deaf students that 
sponsors trips to Six Flags Magic Mountain and Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jessica and Alex said many hearing students seem "stuck up," a word they 
signed by brushing the tips of their noses. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think you are 'deaf and dumb,' " Alex said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica attends a regular math class with hearing students during third 
period. Sitting in the center desk in the front row, Jessica's eyes dart back 
and forth among the math book open on her desk, the paper on which she is 
scribbling notes and the sign language interpreter sitting in front of her. 
</P>
<P>
 She is oblivious to the soft chatter of some of the students behind her. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting next to her is a 16-year-old student who turns slightly in her desk to 
speak to the boy behind her. When asked whether she has ever tried to talk to 
Jessica, a blank look comes over the girl's face. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," she said. "How?" How to Tell if Your Baby Has a Hearing Problem 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say it is crucial to identify hearing-impaired children as early as 
possible. Here are some questions parents can ask themselves over the first 
months and years of a child's life. If the answer to any of these questions is 
no, it is important to have the child's hearing tested. 
</P>
<P>
 For a hearing test, parents may contact their physician, a private audiologist 
or call the county schools superintendent's Hearing Conservation Program at 
388-4438. 
</P>
<P>
 From birth to 3 months old: 
</P>
<P>
 Does your child startle or cry at noises? 
</P>
<P>
 Does your child seem to recognize your voice and quiet down if crying? 
</P>
<P>
 From 4 to 6 months: 
</P>
<P>
 Does your child respond to changes in your tone of voice? 
</P>
<P>
 Does your child look around for the source of new sounds, such as a barking 
dog or a vacuum cleaner? 
</P>
<P>
 From 7 months to 1 year: 
</P>
<P>
 Does your child understand "no," "bye-bye" and other common words? 
</P>
<P>
 Does your child turn or look up when you call his or her name? 
</P>
<P>
 Does your child listen when spoken to? 
</P>
<P>
 From 1 to 2 years: 
</P>
<P>
 Can your child point to pictures in a book when they are named? 
</P>
<P>
 Can your child understand simple questions such as "Where is your shoe?" 
</P>
<P>
 Does your child listen to simple stories or songs? 
</P>

ELECTIONS / SUPERIOR COURT; RACE FOR JUDGESHIP FOCUSES ON D. A.'S ROLE; 
POLITICS: BRADBURY'S SUPPORT OF WHITE'S CANDIDACY SPARKS DEBATE IN LEGAL 
COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the closing weeks of one of the county's most heated political battles -- 
the race for a Superior Court judgeship -- the focus has increasingly been 
directed away from the candidates to a figure who isn't even seeking the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury's role as "honorary chairman" 
for candidate Colleen Toy White -- his top assistant and longtime friend -- has 
sparked widespread debate in the legal community. 
</P>
<P>
 Many lawyers believe that it is inappropriate for White, 50, to permit a 
sitting district attorney to have a role in her campaign against defense 
attorney James M. Farley. Others, however, contend that district attorneys 
should be allowed to support any candidate for elected office in whatever way 
they want. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lawyers have every right to support and oppose judges, period," declared Ira 
Reiner, the former Los Angeles County district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco Bar Assn. President Ray Marshall disagrees. While he isn't 
opposed to prosecutors endorsing judicial candidates, he believes that they 
cross "a fine line" when they serve in campaign staff positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just not aware of a situation where (a district attorney) has acted as a 
campaign manager or honorary chairman of a judicial campaign," Marshall said. 
"It's really the appearance issue and public perception." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the support of Bradbury, some lawyers are criticizing White for 
not speaking out against the district attorney's recent decision to disqualify 
a judge from criminal cases and for her past business associations with 
Bradbury. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethically, White stands on firm ground in allowing Bradbury to be her honorary 
campaign chairman, legal experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the State Bar of California nor the California Judges Assn. have rules 
prohibiting such activity. 
</P>
<P>
 And the latitude of that involvement is wide. Prosecutors can do anything from 
endorsing candidates to running their campaigns, although most stop at making 
an endorsement, State Bar board member Michael Case said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some lawyers say district attorneys and judicial candidates should set 
standards for themselves that are higher than those adopted by legal groups. 
</P>
<P>
 If not, elected officials and judicial candidates run the risk of losing 
public confidence, the lawyers say. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of White, several attorneys said they wondered whether the 
candidate had compromised her independence by allowing Bradbury to be involved 
in her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 White, assistant district attorney for 11 years, says she has not. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely, I will be independent," White said in an interview. "If I have 
any value to this office, it is because I have always given Mike my independent 
opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury said he threw his support behind White's campaign because he has 
known her long enough to believe that she has the integrity to wear a judge's 
robe. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't deny that, as district attorney, he likes to see judges who are 
tough on criminals on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way everybody thinks," Bradbury said. "You want to support someone 
who mirrors your view of how things are supposed to be." 
</P>
<P>
 White said that despite drawing some negative attention, she believes that 
Bradbury's backing is well worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am extremely proud to have him support me," she said. "I think there would 
be a question if he didn't support me." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time that Bradbury has been criticized for playing a 
role in a local judicial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 He also served as honorary chairman in 1991 for Municipal Judge Ken W. Riley, 
who went on to win a seat on the Superior Court. Riley has not heard a case on 
the criminal court since his selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury said he does not get involved in the daily operations of any judicial 
campaign. His role in White's campaign is largely symbolic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means that you lend your name to the campaign, that you sign fund-raising 
letters when appropriate," Bradbury said. "It does not mean that you manage the 
campaign, and I do not. I am not a member of any strategy committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I support her. I endorsed her. I made a contribution to her campaign. And 
that basically is the extent of my involvement," he said. "She has her own 
campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some local attorneys -- mostly from the defense bar -- argue that the 
prosecutor should stay as far away from judicial politics as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "The appearance of impropriety is as bad as impropriety itself," Farley said. 
"Mike Bradbury's appearance of stacking the court, of pushing his own people 
in, is the appearance of impropriety." 
</P>
<P>
 Farley and others said they do not believe that White would be capable of 
impartiality in trying cases involving Bradbury's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "She should not be allowed to hear criminal cases until . . . Bradbury is no 
longer in office," Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say they are concerned about what they perceive to be Bradbury's desire 
to load the court with his former staff members. Already, more than half of the 
judges on the 15-member Superior Court once worked in the district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Wendy Lascher said she is concerned about Bradbury's role in 
White's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's someone she owes a lot of gratitude to," Lascher said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she is also troubled by some of the letters that Bradbury has signed 
for White, including one that refers to Farley as an "anti-death penalty, 
criminal-coddling attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 That same letter goes on to say: "I can't recall when the public last had such 
a clear choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lascher: "The letter he wrote was outrageous and offensive -- offensive 
to everyone in the county." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Lascher said she is not surprised that the district attorney 
wants like-minded people on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a perfect world, we would want more neutrality," she said. "But it's not a 
perfect world." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Neil B. Quinn said he also believes that White would be 
too indebted to Bradbury if she defeats Farley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every action in her campaign suggests that the best way to be elected is to 
trumpet Mr. Bradbury," Quinn said. "She is totally dependent on Mike Bradbury." 
</P>
<P>
 Some lawyers are second-guessing their support of White for other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 They are concerned about Bradbury's move in April to disqualify Superior Court 
Judge Lawrence Storch from hearing any new criminal cases. Storch is the senior 
judge in the court's criminal section. 
</P>
<P>
 Storch and Bradbury have collided over some of the policies of Bradbury's 
office, including one that prohibits plea bargaining in most instances. Storch 
has said the policy unnecessarily bogs down the court. Bradbury considers 
Storch too lenient. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge and the prosecutor have disagreed on several high-profile murder 
cases in which Storch handed out rulings against the recommendation of the 
district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Case of the State Bar -- who personally supports White for judge -- said he is 
"struggling" to make sense out of Bradbury's actions toward Storch. He said he 
would not withdraw his support for White because of it, but would like to know 
where she stands on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 White and Bradbury have refused to comment directly on the Storch 
disqualification. Bradbury has said he wants tough judges on the bench and not 
"touchy-feely, anti-death penalty types." 
</P>
<P>
 "I happen to want a judge on the bench who has a similar philosophy," Bradbury 
said. "What is so mysterious and problematic about this? As a district 
attorney, I certainly would not want someone philosophically opposed to the 
death penalty or, as Mr. Farley says, morally opposed to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would I want someone like that on the bench?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury and White, promoted to assistant district attorney in 1984, have been 
friends since the 1970s. White helped Bradbury on his first campaign for 
district attorney in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair's friendship has also included business deals. In 1989, Bradbury and 
White bought a condominium in Camarillo as a rental investment. They sold the 
property last year, records show, and both now call it a bad business deal. 
Bradbury said he has also made investments with several other friends who wound 
up on the bench, including Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 He was always careful to divest himself of those interests, Bradbury said, 
before his partners assumed a judgeship. 
</P>
<P>
 White said she has had business deals with other members of the district 
attorney's office -- most of them successful. She said she is financially 
secure and described herself as "very frugal." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she sees nothing wrong with her investment with Bradbury, but in 
hindsight wishes that she had not made it because the real estate market fell 
shortly after the condo was purchased. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real bad investment," she said.

STRAWBERRY FETE ATTRACTS RECORD GATE; OXNARD: ABOUT 85,000 TAKE IN THE TWO DAYS 
OF FESTIVAL ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING 45,000 SUNDAY. ORGANIZERS ARE THRILLED WITH 
THE NUMBERS.

 You could have eaten off her face. 
</P>
<P>
 From forehead to chin, Oxnard resident Sue San Martin wore strawberry tart 
like a syrupy red mask after her 13-year-old son smashed the sticky sweet 
dessert in her face. 
</P>
<P>
 "She got me last year," said Brian San Martin, explaining that he had waited a 
year to pay back his mom. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't retaliate last year," said the 46-year-old mother, wiping pie crust 
crumbs off her sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Martin family feud was just one of many pay-back opportunities for 
revenge-minded children at the California Strawberry Festival. An estimated 
45,000 packed the festival site at Oxnard's College Park on Sunday, the final 
day of the two-day event. 
</P>
<P>
 At the strawberry tart toss competition, 4-year-old Hana Lewkow of Culver City 
nailed her dad on the nose with a pint-sized pie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got whacked," Ray Lewkow said after the contest, which was one of the 
highlights of the 11th annual festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite four years of baseball experience, 9-year-old Devin O'Fallon's dessert 
pitching went sour Sunday. The Hancock Park girl could not land one of her 
three tart tosses directly on her father's face, but did manage to splatter him 
with strawberry filling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty messy and gooey," Jim O'Fallon said. "But the two women in back 
scrub you down, so it's not all bad." 
</P>
<P>
 As first-time Strawberry Festival-goers, the O'Fallons were impressed with the 
variety of food booths, live entertainers and contests. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fantastic," O'Fallon said. "There are great games, and they (children) 
don't get to throw pies at their parents every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Festival organizers were thrilled with the teeming crowds, which surpassed 
previous festival attendance totals for the weekend event. In addition to 
Sunday's crowd, about 40,000 people attended the event Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 When the festival began in 1984 at Channel Islands Harbor, the two-day 
attendance total was 25,000. The festival has since been moved to College Park 
to accommodate the growing numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, volunteers working in the festival's 30-plus food booths were 
delighted by the large attendance, which equated to big bucks for their 
nonprofit groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to do twice what we did last year," said Mike Pettit, a parent 
volunteering in the Buena High School band's funnel cake booth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Strawberry Festival is the band's largest fund-raiser, said Pettit's wife, 
Charlene. Last year, strawberry-topped funnel cake sales at the event generated 
$2,500 for the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard residents Peter de Leon and David Zamudio donned giant red berry 
costumes in an attempt to lure passersby to Our Lady of Guadalupe's food booth. 
</P>
<P>
 The La Colonia church supporters were selling strawberry tamales and other 
dishes to raise money for church retreats and building maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We volunteer because we want to help the community," Zamudio said, peering 
out from his Fruit of the Loom-style costume. 
</P>
<P>
 Artisans selling everything from kites to cutting boards and bird houses to 
baby clothes anticipated fat profits from the weekend's crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't miss with this many people," said Ojai potter Frank Masserella, who 
brought his glazed jars and vases to the festival for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been trying to get in for three years," he said, explaining that the 
festival competition is fierce. 
</P>
<P>
 For three years, Michelle James has claimed a spot among the dozens of 
artisans at the festival, selling her hand-painted T-shirts and children's 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can tell by the quality of the work that's here that it's a very well put 
together show," the San Diego-based artist said. "It really is a big event."

STREET SMART: CONFUSING FREEWAY ON-RAMP IN VENTURA TO BE WIDENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 A confusing on-ramp for the northbound Ventura Freeway in Ventura is a safety 
hazard. The troublesome ramp is on Main Street near Mills Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is caused when cars coming from both eastbound and westbound Main 
Street try to enter the single-lane ramp at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a yield sign for drivers entering from eastbound Main, but it is 
frequently ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 One possible solution would be to add a second lane to the on-ramp, so that 
cars from both directions could enter at the same time without risk of a 
collision. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this possible? 
</P>
<P>
 Sarath Abeyweera 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Your solution to the problem is exactly what the city has in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 In a joint project between the city of Ventura and the state Department of 
Transportation, the on-ramp will be widened within the next year, Ventura City 
Engineer Rick Raives says. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans will also add a dual left-turn lane for westbound Main Street traffic 
entering the ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very confusing intersection and a potential hazard," Raives said. 
"We're really looking forward to getting this improvement in place." 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 A few months ago, I wrote about the need for a crosswalk at Ralston Street and 
Sunridge Drive in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 City Traffic Engineer Nazir Lalani responded by saying that the crosswalk on 
nearby Robin Street is sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 But kids are still crossing at Sunridge, which is a very dangerous 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Could the city reconsider putting in a crosswalk at Sunridge? 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Sanchez 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 A crosswalk is not going to solve the safety problem at Sunridge, Ventura City 
Engineer Rick Raives says. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is it too close to the crosswalk at Robin, but adding a second 
crosswalk could increase the danger of the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crosswalks give pedestrians a false sense of security," Raives said. "Adding 
another one is not going to do any good." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "The issue of children crossing at Sunridge instead of walking to 
the nearest stoplight needs to be dealt with some other way. We've done all we 
can from a traffic safety standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to know why the lighting and striping are so bad on Los Angeles 
Avenue in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the town's main thoroughfare, yet the lighting is so bad and the 
striping so faint that you can't see a thing at night. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem seems especially bad along a curve between Tapo Street and the 
Metrolink station, where the road is dark and very hard to maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
 I've lived in Simi for eight years and I know that there have been a lot of 
accidents along that street. 
</P>
<P>
 How much would a little paint cost? We certainly pay enough taxes to have this 
strip of road improved. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Green 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Avenue, like every other street in Simi Valley, undergoes an 
annual inspection and road striping make-over by the city public works 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 But paint on curves such as the one on Los Angeles at Tapo Street tends to 
fade more quickly, City Traffic Engineer Bill Golubics says. 
</P>
<P>
 City workers will apply a new coat along the curve soon and will keep a close 
eye on it in the future to make sure that the paint remains visible, Golubics 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the absence of street lights, there's little that can be done to 
further illuminate the roadway, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The city budget only allows for street lights at major intersections. Drivers 
must rely on their car headlights along the stretches between intersections. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a cost-saving policy," Golubics said. "The city doesn't have the 
resources to pay for maintenance and electricity for so many lights."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; YOUTHS PAINT MURAL WITH A MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michelangelo would be proud. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers and children in one of Ventura's poorest neighborhoods are trying 
to brighten their community by painting a colorful mural on the side of a 
liquor store. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an eye-catching, colorful assault on the senses, splashing 70 feet wide 
and 12 feet high off a major commercial street on the city's west end. It 
depicts gangsters burning their guns amid rainbows and sunshine. It shows lots 
of grass, sky and flowers. And it features children of various ethnicities, and 
messages such as "Stop the violence." Another message states, "It's not cool to 
target kids," aimed at the alcohol and tobacco industries. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of local artist M. B. Hanrahan, about 25 to 40 children age 6 to 
17 arm themselves with paintbrushes and ladders several times a week and attack 
the white wall of Avenue Liquor Store, 580 N. Ventura Ave. They started May 10, 
and are expected to finish in about a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The mural is being funded by a grant from the Ventura County Alcohol and Drug 
Program, said Roberta Payan, director of Westpark, a neighborhood recreation 
center. Some of the older teen-agers receive school credit for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Yvette Gutierrez, 10, said she is helping to paint because she wants her 
neighborhood to look prettier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of tagging, you should cover up the place with murals," Yvette said 
as she perched atop a ladder and created a light blue sky on the wall, 
accidentally smearing paint in her hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Payan acknowledged that it's ironic to have an anti-alcohol and tobacco 
message on the side of a liquor store, but she said owner Ray Ramirez did not 
object to the mural. Ramirez could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ray is trying to be a responsible businessman," Payan said, "and a 
responsible businessman does not sell alcohol or tobacco to minors." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanrahan came up with the mural idea, and the children approved, Payan said. 
Avenue Hardware and Sheridan Way School will also be targeted for murals, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogelio Botello spent Friday afternoon painting a man on the wall, working 
within outlines that Hanrahan had already drawn. Periodically, he would lean 
back and check his work.  
</P>
<P>
 "You want to know what this means?" the 17-year-old said. "It means that 
someone cares about this place." PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; DECISION ON HOUSING PROJECT IS DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Camarillo Planning Commission has delayed a decision on a developer's 
proposal to build 89 single-family homes on the city's northwest side until 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioners postponed the matter until June 7 so that Spanish Hills 
Development Co. and the Pleasant Valley School District might have time to 
reach an agreement on fees the company must pay the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Spanish Hills developers want the commission to change the 52-acre parcel's 
zoning from rural to residential planned development, which would allow 89 
houses, instead of only 39, on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The project would be more modest than the adjacent 430-acre Spanish Hills 
housing and golf course development, where houses are 3,500 square feet or 
larger. The new proposal calls for the houses to range between 1,900 and 2,500 
square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the state School Facilities Act, developers must pay school 
districts $2.65 per square foot for each residential project that is built. But 
when a zone change is requested, the law allows a school district to negotiate 
higher fees than the state minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the Planning Commission approve the proposal, the matter will go before 
the City Council, which rules on all zoning changes. The council has 
tentatively scheduled the issue for its June 22 meeting. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; 4 REPORTED STABBED IN MELEE AT PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 25-year-old Oxnard man was listed in serious condition Sunday at St. John's 
Medical Center with multiple stab wounds after a weekend party in El Rio that 
turned violent. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Reyes was one of four men stabbed by unknown assailants late Saturday 
after some uninvited guests entered a private party on Balboa Street and 
refused to leave, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The conditions of the other three men -- Marcario Gomez, 25; Bernabe Franco, 
23, and Jesus Garcia, 22 -- were not available from supervisors at Ventura 
County Medical Center. All are from Oxnard, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's investigators first reported Saturday that three men 
were shot in a gunfight during a baptismal party. Officials said Sunday, 
however, that the shots did not strike anyone, but that four men were stabbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a bunch of hurt people and a whole crowd of uncooperative victims," 
Lt. Paul Anderson said. "Initially, there were some shots, but no one was hit. 
Then out came the stilettos and they went to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said that there could be other victims from the melee, but none had 
come forward and that witnesses were reluctant to tell investigators further 
details of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investigation will continue, but we've got a whole bunch of people saying 
they don't know anything," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said more than 100 people were attending the baptismal before 
the fight broke out. JEFF McDONALD

<P>
 Kinko's Service Corp., the fast-growing international copying company, has 
announced plans to move 125 employees from its Ventura corporate headquarters 
to Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has signed a seven-year, $4.9-million lease for three floors at 
the Oxnard Town Center office building, Kinko's executive Adrianna Foss said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all over each other here," Foss said. "It's helping with some of the 
gridlock." About 375 people work at the corporate office. The company plans to 
eventually expand on the Ventura site, Foss said. The 125 affected employees 
work in the accounts receivable department. They will be relocated in August or 
September, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Including the Kinko's lease, the Oxnard Town Center building is about 90% 
leased, said Alex Woronovich of Grubb & Ellis Co., which put together the deal 
with Bedord Property Investors. That group purchased the five-story building in 
December. PEGGY Y. LEE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: 2 DIE IN SEPARATE AUTO ACCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men were killed early Sunday in separate car accidents, one of which 
involved a Thousand Oaks sheriff's patrol car responding to another unrelated 
crash, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first accident occurred about 12:20 a.m. Sunday.Paul Gittings, a 
21-year-old Navy airman stationed at Miramar Naval Air Station in San Diego, 
was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Oklahoma, Gittings was in the back seat of a car driven by Charles 
Richwine, another 21-year-old airman from Miramar, a deputy coroner said. A 
second passenger, Robert Sponseller, 21, suffered major injuries in the crash 
and was listed in serious condition at St. John's Medical Center in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Richwine was driving along Potrero Road near Camarillo when he lost control of 
his Pontiac, which ran up an embankment and overturned, the California Highway 
Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richwine was arrested on suspicion of felony drunk driving and vehicular 
manslaughter. He was released Sunday on his own recognizance and ordered to 
return for a May 27 arraignment, a Ventura County Jail commander said. 
</P>
<P>
 About two hours later, Deputy Brad Guzzard was responding to a traffic 
accident when his car was broadsided by a vehicle at Westlake Boulevard and 
Hampshire Road in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Eduardo Melendez Martinez, 25, of Thousand Oaks was thrown from the car 
and killed. He was a day laborer and is survived by his parents, who live in 
Mexico. His two passengers were injured, but further information was 
unavailable Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Guzzard was treated for minor injuries and released. JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; SCHOOL DISTRICT TO INSTALL VOICE MAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a result of $100,000 in budget cuts to the Simi Valley school district 
office, calls from the public will soon be answered by voice mail rather than a 
receptionist. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of the Simi Valley Unified School District has voted 3 to 2 to 
eliminate the switchboard operator, along with a part-time clerk and an 
employee who catalogued videotapes in the district resource center.In addition, 
the board cut temporary clerks to replace absent employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts were part of $2.5 million shaved from the 1994-95 budget. Earlier in 
the year, the board agreed to slash $100,000 from the district office payroll. 
Tuesday's action identified the specific positions to be cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Although eliminating the switchboard operator's position will save the 
district $32,300 a year, buying the voice mail equipment will cost between 
$12,000 and $15,000, officials said. JULIE FIELDS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; NEW SITE PLANNED FOR MAINTENANCE YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A complicated land swap involving the state Department of Transportation, the 
city of Moorpark and a developer has been worked out, moving Caltrans' proposed 
maintenance yard away from the main entrance to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans had planned to build a repair yard to store heavy equipment and 
trucks on Los Angeles Avenue at Moorpark Freeway.City officials said the yard 
would detract from a regional shopping mall planned for the area.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a key location for the city," Mayor Paul Lawrason said. "It would be 
totally inappropriate to place a Caltrans yard with industrial-type equipment 
at the entrance of the city, especially when we had plans for a mall right next 
door."  
</P>
<P>
 The city sued Caltrans to block construction, forcing negotiations to relocate 
the yard. An alternative site on Fitch Avenue that is owned by a local 
developer was found. SCOTT HADLY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: TAKASUGI REJECTS $19,500 PAY RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblyman Nao Takasugi (R-Oxnard) has decided to refuse a $19,500 pay 
increase that an independent commission granted for state legislators earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi had said he would take the raise, but an aide said he had not known 
at the time that the lawmaker could refuse the 37% increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did have inaccurate information," aide Julia King said. "But he found out 
since then that he could refuse it." 
</P>
<P>
 King said the assemblyman sent a letter to state Controller Gray Davis asking 
that the extra money be spent on public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Citizens Compensation Commission established the pay raise, 
which begins in December. Legislators' salaries will increase from $52,500 to 
$72,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley), who is running for lieutenant 
governor, is still undecided about accepting the raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Paula L. Boland (R-Granada Hills) has said she will accept the 
raise, while an aide to Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) said he is 
still undecided. MARY F. POLS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CAREER DAY TO FOCUS ON LIFE SCIENCE WORK

<P>
 Scientists can wear blue jeans and use the outdoors as their laboratory, about 
400 students will be told Tuesday at a Life Science Career Day at the Ventura 
County Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The special day of activity is intended to interest students in disciplines 
such as farming, home economics and pest control.It is offered by the 
University of California Cooperative Extension for junior high and high school 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to provide an opportunity for kids to have an exposure to a 
number of careers that they never thought about," said Rose Hayden-Smith, 
spokeswoman for the extension program. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's career day is the first locally by the university, but is expected 
to be held annually, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although several local organizations donated money and resources to the 
program, the project has been primarily sponsored by the Hansen Trust, 
established by a former area rancher for agricultural education and research.

JACK SMITH: CELEBRATING THE ROUTINE JOYS OF DODGER DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As I have said before, nothing arouses such nostalgia in the heart of an old 
American as a Sunday at the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because, in part, baseball is so slow to change. While the world reels 
from change, baseball remains pretty much the same. It's still three strikes 
you're out at the old ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, television money has made millionaires of even journeyman 
outfielders. Remember when Sandy Koufax, the great Dodger left-hander, held out 
for a measly $125,000 a year and Don Drysdale struck for only $100,000? Today 
they pay untried rookies that much. 
</P>
<P>
 Today we have that silly designated hitter rule, which allows a non-playing 
batter to bat for the pitcher, but fortunately that is limited to the misguided 
American League.  
</P>
<P>
 We went to the game on a recent Sunday when the Dodgers were playing the San 
Diego Padres. Of course that game is history now to sports fans, who will have 
read Tim Kawakami's story reporting that the Dodgers won, 7-1, to climb within 
one game of the then-division-leading San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a big day for the old-timers, players who have reached the age of 30 
and been around a few years. What excites me about a baseball game is not the 
home runs but the routine fielding plays. An outfielder runs, leaps 
horizontally through the air, reaches out and spears a fly ball two feet above 
the ground; a shortstop charges a hard-hit grounder, scoops it up on a dead 
run, transfers it to his throwing hand and throws the runner out at first base. 
Routine plays, but they employ the breathtaking coordination of a figure 
skater. 
</P>
<P>
 The day was overcast, but, as usual, it did not rain. My wife and I and our 
older son and his wife and their three children were guests of Peter O'Malley 
in his box, sitting with such distinguished fans as Rachel Robinson, widow of 
Jackie, and Roxie Campanella, widow of Roy. I no doubt dazzled the two women 
with my knowledge of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The reader may wonder why I enjoy such a privilege. O'Malley and I have been 
friends for years through our membership in a men's club, and he knows my 
family loves baseball -- even my wife, who loves it when we sit in O'Malley's 
box. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For her, the highlight of the day came when she remembered hearing on the 
radio that Tommy Lasorda, the Dodgers' manager, kept caged birds. As a bird 
fancier herself, she asked O'Malley if he knew what kinds of birds Lasorda 
kept. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll know in five minutes," he said, and left to dispatch a message, 
evidently to the sports box. Five minutes later he turned up with a sheet of 
paper on which was typed the following information: 
</P>
<P>
 "Facts on Tommy Lasorda's five parakeets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Received the five parakeets on opening day of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are four green parakeets and one blue parakeet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roger McDowell gave the birds to Tommy as a good-luck present for the 1994 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tommy named the birds after the 1994 infield players and catcher. The blue 
parakeet has been named Piazza. The oldest bird is named Wallach, the slowest 
bird is named Karros and the two quick birds are DeShields and Offerman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tommy is quick to point out that the birds know by the tone of his voice 
which team won the game. After a Dodger win the birds can be heard all during 
the postgame and after a loss the five birds remain quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point my granddaughter Alison told her father that she felt very 
nostalgic at the game. I was not surprised that a bright 17-year-old knew the 
word, but I wondered that she could feel nostalgic at that age. She said it was 
the singing of "The Star-Spangled Banner," the roar of the crowd, the sound of 
the ball on the bat and all those cherished things. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidentally, a few minutes later I heard Vin Scully say something 
pertinent: "When I was younger I could remember everything, whether it happened 
or not." He added: "I think that was Mark Twain." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the ballgame, everybody who has a portable radio has it tuned in to Vinny 
so they'll know what's happening. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Bartlett's, what Twain said was: "When I was younger I could 
remember anything, whether it happened or not; but I'm getting old, and soon I 
shall remember only the latter." 
</P>
<P>
 But Vinny was close enough. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a feeling that any teen-ager who feels nostalgic at a baseball game is 
growing up fine. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sixth inning the Dodgers scored three runs -- two on a double by Raul 
Mondesi and one on a bunt by pitcher Tom Candiotti -- and went on to win it. 
</P>
<P>
 I could imagine Lasorda's parakeets chortling their little hearts out.

'MAVERICK' WINS BIG POT AT BOX OFFICE; MOVIES: AN ESTIMATED $17.2-MILLION TAKE 
FOR THE WEEKEND IS THE BIGGEST OPENING THIS YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Maverick," with Mel Gibson in the title role of the legendary card shark of 
the Old West, galloped to an estimated $17.2 million at the box office in its 
opening weekend -- the biggest debut for any film so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The large box-office total was welcome news to the film industry, which has 
seen sluggish ticket sales for the last six weeks. And, as the first major 
movie of the summer season, Warner Bros.' "Maverick" was also watched by the 
industry as an indicator of audience enthusiasm for the all-important period 
from Memorial Day in May to Labor Day in September, which traditionally 
accounts for about 40% of the year's ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "The movie market has been in the doldrums for the last five or six weeks, but 
'Maverick' jump-starts the marketplace," said Warner Bros.' distribution 
president Barry Reardon. "By the time 'Beverly Hills Cop III' and 'The 
Flintstones' open, you'll see the grosses rise to the traditional holiday 
levels." 
</P>
<P>
 "Beverly Hills Cop III," starring Eddie Murphy, opens nationally Wednesday, 
and "The Flintstones," a live-action movie based on the popular animated TV 
series from the 1960s, opens on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maverick" was showing on 2,537 screens, or 10% of all U.S. screens. Reardon 
said he expects the box office for the film to hold at about $17 million for 
the four days of the Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The $17-million first weekend compared more than favorably to the opening on 
the same weekend a year ago of "Sliver" starring Sharon Stone, which took in 
$12 million, and "Hot Shots Part Deux," which did $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maverick's" strong showing came against a backdrop of some industry 
apprehension about the commercial appeal of the Western genre, which has 
largely fallen out of fashion. There have been notable exceptions, though, with 
such successful recent Westerns as "Dances With Wolves," "Unforgiven" and last 
December's "Tombstone." 
</P>
<P>
 The next test will come June 24 when Warner releases "Wyatt Earp," starring 
Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid in a three-hour-long film about the Western 
legend, written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maverick" drew generally mixed reviews, but theater owners had expected the 
film to play well based on the familiarity of the title from the original ABC 
television series that starred James Garner, and the star power of Gibson, 
Jodie Foster and Garner (who appears in the film). The movie was directed by 
Richard Donner.

 "Maverick" commanded slightly more than 40% of all the tickets sold during the 
weekend. Reardon said that exit surveys showed 86% of the audience ranked the 
film "excellent" or "very good." He said 71% said they would recommend the 
movie.

<P>
 Preliminary industry estimates of weekend box-office activity showed that the 
rest of the market was dominated by No. 2-ranked "The Crow," starring the late 
Brandon Lee, with $7.8 million, and No. 3-ranked "When a Man Loves a Woman," 
with Andy Garcia and Meg Ryan, $6.8 million. Director Spike Lee's "Crooklyn" 
took a 47% nose-dive at the box office, down to an estimated $2.4 million in 
its second weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 In fifth place was "Four Weddings and a Funeral," with $1.9 million; sixth was 
"With Honors," $1.6 million; seventh, "Three Ninjas Kick Back," $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In eighth: "No Escape," $700,000, followed by "Clean Slate," $665,000, and

BACKSTAGE WITH BARBRA; ADORATION AND ACCLAIM SURPRISE SUPERSTAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>

 "You didn't used to like me, did you?"  
</P>
<P>
 Barbra Streisand's opening line in her first sit-down interview of her concert 
swing isn't encouraging. She's in her dressing room at the Palace of Auburn 
Hills arena, a half-hour after performing before 14,000 wildly enthusiastic 
fans on her first tour in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand, 52, has often been critical of the media, which she feels has 
frequently portrayed her as humorless, domineering and aloof. Interviews have 
been as rare as concerts over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the potential sting in her greeting -- based on criticisms in the 1970s 
and '80s about what I felt was a sometimes overly dramatic vocal delivery and 
inappropriate material -- is quickly softened by a playful smile. Times have 
changed and so has Streisand. 
</P>
<P>
 On this tour -- which begins a six-night stand Wednesday at the Anaheim Pond 
-- Streisand, the performer, is a revelation. Her singing is graceful, her 
material purposeful and her manner endearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Backstage, the private Streisand is equally revealing. She is strongly 
opinionated and is still sensitive enough about the media to detail past 
slights with the slightest prodding. 
</P>
<P>
 But this interview was about her concert tour, not the media -- and she proved 
warm and refreshingly straightforward, no trace of the pretentiousness often 
found in superstar artists. 
</P>
<P>
 For all her years in the spotlight, Streisand still seems sufficiently awed by 
all the public adoration and acclaim to be a tad nervous being asked about it. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been both surprised and touched, she says, by the demand for tickets 
to her six-city tour and the outpouring of affection at the shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you get to a certain age, you don't take things for granted . . . things 
we took for granted for 30 some years," she says, wearing a simple black dress 
and sitting in a chair. "I never sort of felt this before in my life . . . 
standing back a bit and appreciating my career . . . and my fans . . . 
everything in life." 
</P>
<P>
 But even this experience isn't likely to get her back on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 In an exclusive interview with The Times, Streisand spoke about why she 
avoided formal live performances for more than 20 years and why she says she 
won't ever tour again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How could you have stayed away from live performances for so long? 
Don't we hear all the time about performers needing the love and applause of 
the audience? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I understand how people can feel that way, but that's not a way I 
fulfill myself. I don't enjoy the spotlight. I really prefer the privacy of the 
creative process. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Wasn't there a time when that acceptance was important to you -- say back 
in the beginning when you were playing clubs? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Oh, sure, because I had nothing else. I had to prove so much when I was a 
youngster because my mother was telling me that I'll never make it and all of 
that. I had to escape my life so I had to go into the world of the imagination, 
and music was one (way.) But I only turned to singing because I couldn't get a 
job as an actress. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Was it a thrill when you finally got into acting . . . eventually into 
"Funny Girl"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: In the beginning, it was. When we were changing "Funny Girl" every night 
(before the Broadway opening), I loved it . . . I would eat Chinese meals 
before I went on. Nothing bothered my stomach. That's what I love . . . the 
experimentation. But once they froze that show on Broadway, I was in prison. I 
had to do the same thing over and over. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why did you stick with "Funny Girl"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm not a quitter. When I was in "Funny Girl," I was on the cover of Time 
and Life and it put me into a psychological mess. That's when I started to get 
stage fright and went into therapy. I would get sick to my stomach every night 
a half-hour before I went on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why's that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The expectations were so enormous. All these magazine saying I'm great. I 
was going, "What great? I'm 22." I'd be thinking, "How great do I have to be to 
not disappoint these people." . . . That's interesting because all these years, 
in a way, I always thought I would disappoint people. 
</P>
<P>
 I was the one who was most shocked on this tour that anyone would buy my 
(T-shirts and other) merchandising, for instance. I said to Marty (manager 
Marty Erlichman), "Why would you want to put out this stuff?" I have been 
around for 33 years. It's not like I'm a young, hip rock person. It is the same 
thing . . . that pattern has been with me all the way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You were nervous all through "Funny Girl"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, every night. For months, I had (medication) drops on my tongue to calm 
my stomach . . . this fear of forgetting the words because I lose interest, 
which I tend to do once the creative process is over. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did you enjoy playing Vegas in the late '60s and early '70s? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I never wanted to do it, but I was a performer . . . a singer and this is 
what performers and singers do. It was my job. But every night I was terrified. 
. . . So, I finally decided: "I am not going to do it. Why put myself through 
such misery?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What made you change your mind after all these years? 
</P>
<P>
 A: (Clothes designer) Donna Karan gave me a wonderful birthday party and Liza 
Minnelli got up to sing and I am sitting there thinking, "How does she do this? 
How does anyone get up in front of people and sing?" I could never get myself 
to sing at parties . . . with people looking at me. I can sing on stage because 
it is a black curtain out there. I can just see a few people and even that 
disturbs me. So I was fascinated just watching her. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So it became a challenge? 
</P>
<P>
 A: That's right. I didn't like accepting that fright. I am frightened by a lot 
of things, but what I hope is good about me is that I go through the fear. I 
thought, "Why can't I do this?" Besides, so many fans wanted me to sing live. 
People were saying, "You owe it to them." It was starting to get to me. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, several things fell into place. Kirk Kerkorian (owner of the MGM Grand 
Hotel, where Streisand made her return to live performances last New Year's 
Eve) asked how I would like to give away $3 million (to causes of her choice) 
without any obligation to open the hotel. That impressed me. .. . . plus the 
show was going to be New Year's Eve. I hate New Year's Eve. It's a very lonely 
night for me. . . . never a happy time. There is such an obligation to be 
happy. So, I thought: What a great way to escape New Year's Eve . . . doing a 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, my movies weren't ready. I was working on scripts to "Normal 
Heart" and "The Mirror Has Two Faces," and I couldn't get them ready in time to 
shoot. So, the timing was right. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why didn't you take the easier option of just doing a greatest hits show -- 
instead of a more ambitious, scripted show? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I wanted something more personal. I wanted to pick songs that meant 
something to me and then put them into some kind of story or theme so that 
there was a thread running through the show. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is the reflection on the ups and downs of relationships meant to be seen as 
particularly autobiographical or more universal? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I am hoping it to be universal. I was just following the songs. It gives me 
something to act out. My own story is for my autobiography. It's not for this 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you going to do an autobiography? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I have kept journals for years. It'd be just to set the record straight. I 
hate things that are not true. I think the truth is so powerful I never 
understand why the truth is distorted or embellished. That's one of the 
problems I have with the media. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How has criticism from the media and others affected you over the years -- 
both personally and professionally? Has it made you withdraw at times or feel 
more determined? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I did (withdraw from directing) for like eight years. I was so picked on 
for directing "Yentl" that I said, "Forget it. I am disappearing." That's not 
the way to be. The result was I wasted eight years of my life. I should have 
done (things) anyway instead of retreating. So now, as one appreciates time, I 
have to make the most out of it. I have to use (time) to do good in some way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is part of that "good" speaking out on issues? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It is gratifying to have your voice reach people in some way, more than is 
just on record. I was so pleased when I talked about the Colorado boycott (over 
gay rights) and all of a sudden, it happened. It is a responsibility. Just as a 
person and as a citizen, I feel like it is my responsibility to do positive and 
good things with my access to people. It's easier to just remain a hermit and 
part of me likes that, by the way. I like to have a lot of private time. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, it is very, very rewarding when you can (effect change). As 
I have grown older I realize that the most satisfying feelings I get come from 
things outside myself . . . things related to my goddaughter or charity or for 
some cause I believe in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Back to the tour, how nervous were you at the start? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Very nervous. Even in London, I was listening to meditation tapes just 
before I went on -- trying to have a positive attitude because I easily get 
sidetracked into this abyss of fear and I have to get myself out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Were you still nervous on stage tonight? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, I think I have gotten past it (to some extent). I don't have to listen 
to the tapes. I don't feel I need the critics to like me or not. 
</P>
<P>
 But I am not without fear. It's just that my heart isn't palpitating where I 
think I can't make a sound. I've found that I can do a good show without being 
frightened to death. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So, has all this changed your mind about touring? Will you do more? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. This is it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How could you not want to experience all that applause and affection again 
some day? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Because I want to make movies. Directing is what I love. It is about having 
a complete vision . . . having a dream. It is waking up in the morning or 
looking at something in the street or at somebody's face and thinking, "Turn 
the camera on that." It involves everything I love to do . . . including 
dealing with people on a psychological level, trying to get the best out of 
them. It's about going toward the real emotion, getting a moment of truth on 
the screen. That is what really interests me . . . all the aspects of putting 
something together. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How about the loyalty of the audience? Are you touched by that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Sure. There were some special moments -- starting back in Las Vegas . . . 
Coretta King was in the audience. Virginia (Clinton) Kelley was there, my 
goddaughter was there. Those are very special moments for me. I am devoted to 
my goddaughter. All that gave the show a wonderful meaning for me. . . . The 
same other nights. It has been a wonderful experience. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once Streisand agrees to an interview, you see some of the intensity she 
throws into her filmmaking and recordings. After an hour in the dressing room, 
she broke away to attend a party given in the arena lounge by some of the 
musicians in the orchestra. She sat with longtime manager Erlichman and 
songwriters Marilyn and Alan Bergman, who scripted much of the current show. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the band's set, Streisand, in a more relaxed off- the- record 
session, was ready to talk some more -- good-naturedly debating the merits of 
some changes in the show since Las Vegas, including making the ending more 
upbeat than melancholy, and a more serious discussion of the media treatment of 
celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever the perfectionist, she was on the phone again the next morning with some 
more thoughts -- things, she said, that came to her after reflecting on the 
conversation the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 The thoughts included comments about the media and what she sees as a cynicism 
about artists who speak out on public issues. "It is as if we give up our 
citizenship when we become entertainers," she says, sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, however, she wanted to talk about the show and the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "This tour is coming at a good time in my life . . . a time when I have 
learned to see things more positively," she says, softly. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a performer, for instance, I am interested in pursuing excellence, but 
that doesn't mean I always achieve it. I hit and miss all the time, including 
in these shows . . . but I think one of the things that is important in life is 
to learn to accept your imperfections, which is something that I couldn't 
understand for years." 
</P>
<P>
 She pauses. 
</P>
<P>
 "But mostly, I wanted to talk some more about the fans who have come out on 
the tour . . . the way they have stood by all these years . . . despite what 
they may have read . . . their loyalty and faith. That is what has touched me 
most."

APPRECIATION; TREKKING OFF WITH MISSION ACCOMPLISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A star goes nova tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The star is "Star Trek: The Next Generation," whose continuing mission -- on 
television, anyway -- ends this evening, with the fate of humanity resting in 
the hands of Capt. Jean-Luc Picard. The syndicated TV series flares out with an 
epic two-hour finale that hop-scotches through time -- from the 24th Century 
all the way back to the primordial muck of humanity -- and then quietly fades 
to black after seven white-hot seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 All right, the nova analogy may be a bit heavy-handed, but it's difficult not 
to resort to wistful thinking when referring to "Next Generation." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a program, after all, that portrays an idealized future in the 24th 
Century, when the stars are our playground and phasers are always set on stun. 
On board the good star ship Enterprise, the captain quotes Shakespeare and the 
android has heart. Alcohol has been replaced by synthehol -- a manufactured 
booze that can be shrugged off at will when duty calls. And when you get into 
trouble, the Enterprise can always beam you out. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, if only real life were like the world according to "Star Trek."  
</P>
<P>
 I was still in college when "Next Generation" debuted in 1987, and I blew off 
the first couple of seasons like a boring homework assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the series was not airing on a network but on independent stations. I 
didn't really understand the TV business then, but I knew that wasn't a good 
sign. Second, "Next Generation" looked really lame in comparison to the 
original "Star Trek" from the 1960s, which I was watching routinely in 
late-night reruns. 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, the new captain was bald. Sure, Kirk showed some flesh, but it was his 
bare chest, when he went mano y mano with ferocious aliens on hostile planets. 
The mature Picard, as played by Patrick Stewart, a noted stage actor from 
England, seemed more likely to invite aliens into his ready room for tea. 
</P>
<P>
 The android Data, played by Brent Spiner in metallic paint, seemed like a 
logical fill-in for science-officer Spock, but he just didn't have the ears for 
the job. And then there was the chief engineer. Scotty was replaced by Kunta 
Kinte with a clunky metal visor. Were the producers trying to disguise LeVar 
Burton, last seen running from slave traders in "Roots"? 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't get it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But by 1989, when "Next Generation" was in reruns, I was getting tired of 
hearing Bones say for the 10th time, "He's not going to make it, Jim!" (or 
something like that), so I finally gave the new show a try. 
</P>
<P>
 I smirked at the politically correct change in the opening voice-over, which 
proclaimed that this socially conscious crew was "going where no one has gone 
before," rather than no man. I had to look past the stiff Starfleet officers, 
who in the 24th Century had evolved into more peaceful, less tempestuous -- and 
seemingly duller -- explorers. I had to look past the new-model, ergonomically 
designed Enterprise, with the plush upholstery and polished wood trim of a 
Japanese luxury sedan. 
</P>
<P>
 And most difficult of all, I had to look past Burton's dumb visor. Who 
designed that thing?  
</P>
<P>
 But when I got over those changes and let the soothing hum of the Enterprise 
calm my nerves, I was startled by what I observed. The small morality plays so 
well crafted into the original series were here too -- only taking on much more 
provocative issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The definition of life was dramatically explored when Data had to stand trial 
and prove his consciousness, or else be disassembled and manufactured into a 
race of android clones who would be used to serve humanity. Wouldn't that 
constitute . . . slavery ? Our views on sexuality were challenged when Cmdr. 
William Riker, played by Jonathan Frakes, fell for a member of an androgynous 
race who had closet feminine desires, which were forbidden by the society. 
Rather than be allowed to love a man, she (it?) was altered to correct this 
flaw. 
</P>
<P>
 And "Star Trek's" old brain-teaser episodes -- Kirk once talked an evil 
computer into self-destructing by challenging its program with simple logic, a 
trick I sometimes wish I could pull off -- were transformed into time-shifting, 
temporal-distorting plot lines more complex than a computer chip. Each problem 
could only be solved if you understood the entire diagnostics of the 
Enterprise, had a textbook to explain all the gibberish technical language and 
knew all the scientific breakthroughs of the 24th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You couldn't, of course, because new ones were made up each week to get 
through dilemmas. 
</P>
<P>
 But what a ride. I loved it, and I began watching nightly or setting my VCR to 
catch up on the episodes I had missed. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time I interviewed "Star Trek" creator Gene Roddenberry in 1990, 
shortly before his death, I was -- ahem -- a Trekker, I guess. (Trekker, not 
Trekkie -- as I once mistakenly called the loyal "Star Trek" fans in an 
article. Three years later, I'm still receiving letters to remind me of the 
proper term). 
</P>
<P>
 Roddenberry probably explained the interest in "Next Generation" the best: 
"You say you like the show," he said to me. "But many people haven't thought 
too deeply about what it is they like about it. They're not crazy about rocket 
ships. It's none of those things. 
</P>
<P>
 "What our show does -- we take humanity one step into the future. Our people 
do not lie, cheat or steal. They are the best of the best. When you watch the 
show, you say to yourself, at least once, 'My God, that's the way life should 
be.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Roddenberry's vision, however, always was a tough task on writers, because 
good drama is founded in conflict. Before he died, Roddenberry entrusted "Next 
Generation," and all the "Star Trek" generations to come, to executive producer 
Rick Berman, who brought on Michael Piller and Jeri Taylor to help him steer 
the enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 And wherever they lead, I'll probably follow. As long as Paramount allows them 
to maintain the consistency, thoughtfulness and intelligence of Roddenberry's 
original vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Make it so. 
</P>
<P>
 As one early series regular said upon her death: "No goodbys. Just good 
memories. Hailing frequencies closed, sir." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Star Trek: The Next Generation" airs at 8 tonight on KCOP-TV Channel 13.

RACHTMAN TUNES IN WITH 'LOVELINE'; RADIO: HE HAS GONE FROM ROAMING ROCK CLUBS 
TO DISPENSING ADVICE TO YOUNG LISTENERS ON KROQ. 
</P>

 "Everybody talks about the skeletons in their closet. Well, that's mine right 
there," says Riki Rachtman, referring to his appearance in the film "The 
Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years." 
</P>
<P>
 In Penelope Spheeris' 1988 documentary about the outrageous and often 
self-absorbed world of heavy-metal music, a wild-eyed Rachtman can be found 
extolling the salacious aspects of his Los Angeles hard-rock den, the Cathouse. 
The brash club owner is presented as an unapologetic personification of 
heavy-metal decadence. 
</P>
<P>
 As the host of MTV's heavy-metal video program "Headbanger's Ball," Rachtman 
is still very involved in this rowdy rock sub-genre. But he's also living a far 
more subdued lifestyle these days. Indeed, his nights of hard partying at 
L.A.'s rock clubs have been replaced by nights of dispensing advice to the 
mostly young listeners who call into KROQ-FM's popular "Loveline" show with 
their personal problems. (The show also features longtime co-host Dr. Drew 
Pinsky, a.k.a. Dr. Drew.) 
</P>
<P>
 Since joining "Loveline" last August, Rachtman has brought an additional 
element of responsibility and taste to a show that, in the hands of its 
previous co-host, Jim (the Poorman) Trenton, was as much a forum for bawdy 
jokes and crude remarks as it was a vehicle to dispense helpful advice to 
adolescents, teens and young adults. 
</P>
<P>
 (Trenton was suspended last August for orchestrating a prank in which a group 
of listeners converged outside another KROQ personality's home. He has since 
filed a lawsuit against KROQ and its owner, Infinity Broadcasting Corp., 
seeking ownership rights to "Loveline" and $22.5 million in damages for being 
pulled off the air.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people might have thought twice about calling (when Trenton co-hosted 
the show) because they thought (he) would make a joke out of their problem," 
says Rachtman, who shut down the Cathouse about a year ago. "Sometimes things 
are funny, but if I think a joke is going to really hurt somebody, I won't go 
for the laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 Empathy is one of Rachtman's strengths as "Loveline" co-host. He has gone 
through his share of problems with relationships and depression. And as a 
recovering alcoholic and former drug addict, he knows firsthand the hellish 
experience of substance addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachtman had sunken so far into the abyss of drug and alcohol abuse in the 
mid-'80s that he says the manager of the notoriously decadent Guns N' Roses 
asked him to stay away from the band because he was a bad influence on them.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the things that people call about are things that I've gone through, 
or that I'm going through right now," Rachtman says. "I've gone through all the 
drugs, the suicidal problems. The relationship problems I'm going through every 
day. I'm trying to learn how to shut up because I talk too much (on the show). 
I don't always listen to everybody else because they say their problem and I go 
on about how I've gone through the same thing. But I can really relate to a lot 
of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Some fans of the old "Loveline" show have complained that the new program 
lacks the type of over-the-top drama and tension that resulted from the odd 
pairing of the serious-minded Pinsky and the outlandish Poorman. While Pinsky 
often cringed at the Poorman's comments, he stayed on board because the show 
offered a rare chance to reach high-risk adolescents who were attracted to the 
program's sometimes raunchy ambience. Since Rachtman's arrival, Pinsky says, 
more women and young adults are now listening to the program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The Poorman had a real unique ability and he's a serious talent," says 
Pinsky, who has an internal medicine practice and specializes in chemical 
dependency. But with the Poorman, "we constantly verged on the edge of being 
exploitative and harming people. Every night I would go home upset. Now I feel 
proud and comfortable, and I feel like we're doing some good work here and 
there. I enjoy working with Riki. He's a hell of a nice guy, and he's genuinely 
interested in what people are saying and feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Rachtman is at heart a rebellious street kid who at times still 
comes across as a hormone-driven adolescent. And not everything he says on the 
air is going to win the endorsement of the PC police. He once jokingly 
suggested that a member of a celebrity baseball team recruit singer Tevin 
Campbell because he is black and thus "could probably play baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 "I speak my mind and I like to joke around," offers Rachtman. "If you can't 
joke about racism, then I think you're more of a racist. I'll make jokes about 
white people, Mexicans, blacks, Jews. . . . (After the Tevin Campbell comment) 
I got a call from this black guy who was furious. So I said, 'Hey, come down 
and be a guest on the show.' So he did and we talked and he stated his point. 
We ended up being friends." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley-raised Rachtman began hosting "Headbanger's Ball" in 
1990. Every Saturday at midnight he can be seen introducing heavy-metal videos 
and interviewing the musicians who play this earsplitting music. But it's 
"Loveline" that gives Rachtman the much appreciated opportunity to express his 
own opinions and personality. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Loveline' is more me," he remarks. "If you don't like the show, you don't 
like me. I'm not playing a character." 
</P>
<P>
 Rachtman is nothing if not driven. His brain seems to be flooded with various 
project ideas. He is currently lining up investors for a retail clothing store 
he plans to establish. He's also the singer of a punk band called Battery Club, 
which he hopes will move up in the rock ranks. Then there's the idea of 
co-writing a book with Pinsky, and the goal of getting "Loveline" syndicated 
nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Loveline" is of particular importance to Rachtman because it also has 
therapeutic value to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The show has done a lot to help me," he states. "I'm a screwed-up guy. I'm 
not going to lie. I look at the cup as being half empty. It helps me when I 
hear people telling the same drug story I've told, and helping people by 
sharing my own experiences and lending my advice helps me keep sane." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Loveline" can be heard on KROQ-FM (106.7) 8-10 p.m. Sundays and Monday 
through Thursday between 10 p.m. and midnight.

FAMILY; FOOTE LEAVES THE IMPRESSION THERE'S A TWIST FOR EVERYONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you think of gentle Raffi or gushy, sweet Barney when you think of 
children's entertainers, then Canadian singer Norman Foote, with his sly pop 
icon references and use of bizarre, oversize puppets, may come as something of 
a shock. 
</P>
<P>
 The Disney recording artist, who periodically tours the Southland -- 
performing over the weekend at Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks and at 
the Norris Theatre in Palos Verdes -- is indeed child-friendly, but he aims to 
please adults in the audience, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids can snap their fingers, ticktock like clocks, clap and sing along to 
pop-, jazz- and rock-style tunes and inventive lyrics about dinosaurs who don't 
think much of the progress of humans, a yucky dinner ("smashed peas and burnt 
liver") and puffy clouds shaped like "Santa Claus on a buffalo." They can even 
come on stage and solo adorably (or obnoxiously) while the star plays guitar 
backup. 
</P>
<P>
 But Foote's comic gifts -- his skillful timing, expressive physicality and 
wicked sense of humor -- come to full bloom in dead-on impressions of the rich, 
famous and infamous, and in his use of wacky, weird puppets. 
</P>
<P>
 During Saturday's Notre Dame concert, adults roared with delight while Foote 
did "Old MacDonald Had a Farm" as Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash and Sinatra ("Start 
spreadin' manure . . . ") and "I've been Working on the Railroad" as England's 
royal monarch ("Someone's in the kitchen with Diana . . . it's not my Charlie, 
oh, no"). 
</P>
<P>
 Hilarity reigned too, when Foote invited a child on stage, plunked an 
oversize, punkish puppet head with a Mohawk hairdo over the volunteer's head 
and proceeded to do the puppet's voice while manipulating its mouth, especially 
as the bemused child underneath caught on and acted out Foote's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time another puppet doused unsuspecting audience members with a spray 
of water and Foote took his signature curtain call on the shoulders of a giant 
pudgy baby puppet, it was clear that this family entertainer is in a category 
all his own.

COUNCIL TO DECIDE HOW FUNDS WILL BE DIVIDED; SIMI VALLEY: NEARLY $5.5 MILLION 
IN EARTHQUAKE RELIEF IS AVAILABLE. THE PUBLIC IS INVITED TO HEARING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simi Valley City Council will hold a public hearing tonight -- a month 
after the city received an unexpected $5.5 million windfall for earthquake 
relief -- to decide how to spend the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The money is Simi Valley's share of $127 million in Community Development 
Block Grants paid by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development to 
11 cities and two counties hit hard by the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Homes and businesses in Simi Valley suffered more than $400 million in 
quake-related damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents are invited to comment on the city's plan to spend the relief funds 
at a public hearing tonight at Simi Valley City Hall. Following the 6:30 p.m. 
hearing, the council will vote on how to divvy up the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council approves its staff's recommendations, the bulk of the funding 
-- about $4.7 million -- will be spent to repair streets and city buildings, 
construct new homes and offer assistance to residents whose homes were damaged 
in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we tried to do was identify the key areas throughout the city in need of 
help," said Laura Herron, a deputy city manager who coordinated the staff 
report. "It really took a lot of juggling, because even though it seems like a 
lot of money, there are still more projects than we have funding for." 
</P>
<P>
 Staff is recommending that a homeowner assistance program be established to 
offer grants of up to $2,000 to residents whose homes were deemed uninhabitable 
or severely damaged by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors have posted red tags on 51 homes they determined are structurally 
unsafe and yellow tags on 524 homes that are severely damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Judy Mikels said she would like to see homeowner assistance 
expanded to include other residents as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just to say it's yellow-tagged or red-tagged isn't the criteria we should be 
going by," Mikels said. "There are people with lesser damage who may not be 
able to get financial assistance any other way." 
</P>
<P>
 The staff is recommending that an additional $600,000 pay for other projects 
to improve the city's ability to cope with quakes. These include replacing the 
city's phone system and picking up part of the cost of a soil stability study. 
</P>
<P>
 Herron said the phone system is inadequate to handle the onslaught of calls to 
the city during emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a 10-year-old system that just can't perform when the volume of calls 
goes way up," she said. "We've heard a lot of concern about getting something 
in place that can handle emergencies." 
</P>
<P>
 But the bulk of the hearing will likely focus on how to allocate $226,000 
available for other earthquake-related projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The city received 21 applications totaling $1.7 million from businesses and 
nonprofit organizations ranging from the Moose Lodge to Southern California 
Water Co. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional $1 million of the block grant money may be freed for earthquake 
projects if the city is able to persuade the Federal Highway Administration to 
pay a portion of the cost for road repair. 
</P>
<P>
 If the additional $1 million becomes available, the city will hold a second 
public hearing, Herron said. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, however, City Council members must decide which projects are most 
worthy of the $226,000 in guaranteed funding. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members said they would spend the weekend scrutinizing the 
projects and preparing questions for tonight's hearing before deciding which 
ones to select. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an awful lot of money and it looks like we've attracted everybody in the 
world," Mayor Greg Stratton said. "There are, I think, a whole bunch of people 
that are not going to be consistent with the guidelines for this funding." 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Water submitted the largest request -- $600,000 to repair 
damaged water tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 The private company, which serves about 12,000 customers in Simi Valley, is 
ineligible for funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Stratton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said it may not be prudent for the city to award the grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did not have earthquake insurance to cover their damage," Stratton said. 
"If we give them this money, it's like giving them a gift when maybe they 
should have been better prepared for this." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Sandi Webb said she has already ruled out at least two 
applicants: Bottle Village and the Samaritan Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottle Village is a folk-art collection of miniature buildings constructed of 
bottles. Ongoing deterioration at the village was exacerbated by the 
earthquake. The village is asking for $25,000 for earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think it may be too far gone to be worth saving," Webb said. "We 
haven't had the kind of community interest that would merit spending that kind 
of money." 
</P>
<P>
 The Samaritan Center is a drop-in center for homeless people that is scheduled 
to open at St. Francis of Assisi Church in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Brent Brentnall, president of the center's board of directors, said the 
earthquake has increased the number of homeless people in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Brentnall said the center will not be able to open on time unless it can come 
up with $80,000 to finish refurbishing two buildings at the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are at a crucial point now," he said. "If we don't get this money from 
somewhere, we are not going to be able to open." 
</P>
<P>
 But Webb said she would rather spend the quake relief money on fixing damaged 
homes to help prevent residents from becoming homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some people out there who are going to become homeless if we don't 
do something to help them," she said. "That seems to me to be a good way to 
tackle the problem." Simi Valley Earthquake Funding 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley City Council will consider allocating nearly $5.5 million in 
federal Community Development Block Grant funds for earthquake relief. Here is 
the spending formula recommended by city staff: 
</P>
<P>
 $1.8 million: Re-pave portions of Los Angeles Avenue and Tapo, Cochran, 
Stearns and Alamo streets. 
</P>
<P>
 $1.15 million: Establish grant fund to assist residents whose homes were 
severely damaged in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 $700,000: Loan to Griffin Industries to build 70 low-income homes to help 
replace housing damaged in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 $600,000: Set aside for future development projects that will help replace 
housing damaged in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 $450,000: Repair and upgrade the city's phone system to better handle 
emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 $150,900: Salaries for two years for two staff members to ad minister the 
grant program. 
</P>
<P>
 $275,000: Street repairs, including curbs, gutters, sidewalks and block walls 
along residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
 $226,000: Available for distribution for other earthquake-related projects. 
</P>
<P>
 $120,000: City share of cost of repairing block walls along main 
thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
 $25,000: City share of cost for repairs to police station, City Hall and 
senior center. 
</P>
<P>
 $2,100: City share of cost for soil stability study being conducted by state 
Department of Mines and Geology.

WHAT A BUNCH OF YO-YOS!; HIGH-TECH TRICKSTERS AND SOME UNLIKELY SUPPORTERS ARE 
PUTTING A NEW SPIN ON AN AGE-OLD TOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Why did Tom Kuhn build a 256-pound yo-yo? What makes Michael Caffrey think 
kids will prefer yo-yos to Nintendo? 
</P>
<P>
 And what in God's name is Pastor Dennis McBride doing with a yo-yo during 
Sunday service? 
</P>
<P>
 Making it "sleep," of course. (Now that should keep parishioners awake.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in the Philippines for a convention, and they actually asked me to do a 
yo-yo demonstration before I preached," said McBride, 49, who heads Trinity 
Baptist Church in Solvang and stars in his own yo-yo instructional videos. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, I brought the yo-yo out, and the response was great. Ordinarily, I 
wouldn't do that. I try not to trivialize the Gospel." 
</P>
<P>
 Go ahead and say it: They're a bunch of yo-yos. How else to describe a 
fraternity whose most notable member is comedian Tommy Smothers? 
</P>
<P>
 On second thought, don't say it. Let's not trivialize the yo-yo, either. Such 
talk would amount to blasphemy for a handful of -- shall we say, a bit 
eccentric? -- individuals whose imaginations are kept gyrating well into middle 
age by one of the world's oldest and simplest toys. 
</P>
<P>
 The yo-yo, said to have originated in China 500 years before the birth of 
Christ, is as identifiable as the moon to all who walk the Earth. Who hasn't 
tried their hand at walking the dog or shooting the moon, or tested their 
mettle against the class hotshot during recess? 
</P>
<P>
 "Its appeal is that it's just a great toy," said Daniel Volk, 47, of San 
Francisco, who ranks as one of the world's most skilled yo-yo performers and 
has tallied more than 8,000 performances on six continents. "The yo-yo has 
great play value." 
</P>
<P>
 True to its nature, the yo-yo might be making a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Duncan Toys, the world's largest yo-yo maker, launched a national 
advertising campaign in an attempt to entice members of the video-game 
generation. Caffrey, the company's national sales and marketing manager, plans 
to follow by bringing back Duncan's team of yo-yo demonstrators, adroit 
professionals who for decades appeared at drugstores and shopping malls across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Duncan's annual sales have declined from a high of about $20 million in the 
1960s to a current low of about $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe sincerely that the yo-yo's time has come -- or come again," Caffrey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Dale Oliver of Seattle, a former Duncan demonstrator, formed the 
American Yo-Yo Assn., which will sanction three national competitions this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 And Smothers -- whose alter-ego, "The Yo-Yo Man," has become the most popular 
feature of the Smothers Brothers' concert and television act during the past 
several years -- recently purchased the movie rights to the life story of 
Donald F. Duncan, the man who virtually introduced Americans to yo-yos in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always in competitions when I was a kid but never a winner," said 
Smothers, 57, who teamed with brother Dick and Volk to produce a yo-yo video. 
"I consider myself -- to use golf lingo -- to be about a 6 handicap. You take 
the Daniel Volks and those guys, they're scratch yo-yoists." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Give a man a yo-yo, and he'll amuse himself for about 10 minutes. Teach a man 
to yo-yo, and there's no telling what he might do -- work up an act, play Las 
Vegas, wax philosophic, cop an attitude, maybe even reinvent the spinning spool 
on a string with automatic return mechanisms, adjustable string gaps and 
ball-bearing transaxles. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us back -- like a sharply slung Duncan Butterfly on a taut string 
-- to Kuhn, a prominent San Francisco dentist and former teen-age yo-yo 
champion who one day found himself with too much time and no yo-yo to his 
liking on his hands. So, he boned up on Newtonian physics and put a spin on 
traditional yo-yo making. 
</P>
<P>
 Since launching Tom Kuhn Yo-Yos Ltd. in 1977, Kuhn has developed 20 
high-performance and, in some cases, high-priced yo-yos, most with quirky 
features and kooky names -- such as the Roller Woody ($35), Sleep Machine ($40) 
and the Silver Bullet ($40). 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to design a yo-yo for all seasons, so to speak," Kuhn said. "I 
wanted a good dynamic yo-yo that would also be good for string tricks." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhn's wooden No-Jive 3-In-1 ($18), like many of his creations, is a 
"take-apart," meaning its halves can be removed from the axle and reattached to 
form three configurations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Silver Bullet 2, Kuhn's super-spinning, $75 flagship model, is as about as 
high-tech as a yo-yo can get. Crafted from aircraft aluminum, it features a 
ball-bearing transaxle. Simply stated, the yo-yo's halves are attached to an 
axle that spins within a metal sleeve to which the string is attached. 
</P>
<P>
 The SB-2 has been known to spin -- or "sleep" in yo-yo speak -- for the better 
part of two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhn's enthusiasm is nearly boundless. In 1979, he built what was then the 
world's largest yo-yo, a 256-pound, 50-inch-high wooden replica of the No-Jive 
3-In-1 that was lowered from San Francisco's Pier 39 from a 120-foot crane. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhn has even traveled to Houston to query NASA officials on the finer points 
of shooting the moon in a zero-gravity environment. In 1992, astronaut Jeffrey 
Hoffman gave the SB-2 a whirl aboard space shuttle Atlantis. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhn isn't the only one to tinker with tradition. In 1985, Caffrey, who went 
to work as a Duncan demonstrator right out of high school, invented the Yomega 
($10), which features a centrifugal-force-activated "clutch" that allows the 
yo-yo to sleep for about 30 seconds before it automatically returns to the 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Donald F. Duncan Jr., who started his own yo-yo company, Playmaxx, in 
1988, has thrown a high-tech entry into the ring. Duncan's ProYo, a take-apart 
that features a replaceable brass axle, has been lauded for its spinning 
ability. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such yo-yos have found their place in the market, some purists 
consider some of them offensive. Smothers works the No-Jive 3-In-1 and the 
original Silver Bullet into his act because they show well on stage. But they 
are for more advanced players, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty much a traditionalist," Smothers said. "I believe that to make 
yo-yos popular again, you gotta put the original Duncan 44's (a beginner's 
model) in kids' hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Precisely the plan of Caffrey, who sold his interest in Yomega Corp. in 1987 
and recently rejoined Duncan. The company's ad campaign was born largely from 
Caffrey's hunch that today's youths will find yo-yos, most of which cost only 
about $3, new and exciting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your typical 12-year-old has had a video game in his home for five or six 
years," Caffrey said. "But he's probably never seen a yo-yo (operated) well." 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, Caffrey randomly selected 500 Indianapolis youngsters and mailed 
them free "training kits," including a yo-yo, a trick book, a video and a 
letter offering them $25 if they can perform three basic tricks during one of 
his promotional visits to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Duncan's television commercials, airing in the Midwest and expected to debut 
in Southern California early next year, portray kids whirling yo-yos as cool 
and those holding joysticks as nerds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know much, but I know yo-yos," said Caffrey, 36, who was twice 
crowned Arizona state champion by Duncan, at age 14 and 15. "In order to sell, 
they need to be demonstrated. My experience tells me that all yo-yo crazes 
begin with an 11-year-old kid showing (his) friends how to walk the dog and 
rock the baby in the schoolyard." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Caffrey's hunch pays off, the slip loop might be passed to a new generation 
of yo-yo players. 
</P>
<P>
 Volk, who appeared as "Yo Master" on the Smothers Brothers' series of 
television specials in 1988 and '89, has gained such status that he was 
reluctant at first to be interviewed for this story. "I'd rather not be lumped 
together with my imitators," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McBride works a yo-yo into Sunday school lessons as a method of emphasizing 
the importance of responding to God's will. "I do some tricks and then set the 
yo-yo down and command it to do the same tricks," he said. "Obviously, it 
can't." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Kuhn, "Dr. Yo" to friends, concedes that he is "probably a bit nuts" 
about yo-yos. He almost always carries one in his pocket, reaching for it 
between his dental patients the way some people reach for a cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
 Serious yo-yo players have even been known to spin themselves into a 
near-religious state, a meditative dimension in which the very nature of 
existence is contemplated. It has even been given a name: the State of Yo. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a certain philosophy of Yo," Kuhn said. "There's something about a 
yo-yo spinning through space that ties us into ourselves. We realize the entire 
universe is spinning. The State of Yo is universally accepted." 
</P>
<P>
 At least, in yo-yo circles.

ANN CONWAY: DAUGHTERS OF STARS SPEAK FRANKLY, MY DEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Up close, would Judy Lewis look like the stars she claims are her parents, 
Loretta Young and Clark Gable? 
</P>
<P>
 That's what hundreds of movie buffs hoped to find out when they gathered 
recently at the Balboa Bay club to hear Lewis talk about her autobiography, 
"Uncommon Knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 Her dancing eyes? A blend of Gable's and Young's. Her strong jawline and 
forehead? Definitely Gable's. Her drop-dead smile? The same one Rhett flashed 
at Scarlett in "Gone With the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
 And, dare we say it, she once had Gable's wonderful, flyaway ears. But they 
are flat against her head now, almost hidden beneath a platinum bob. "I had 
plastic surgery on them when I was 7," she said. "Mom had it done." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the agenda at the monthly get-together of Round Table West: Maria 
Riva, daughter and biographer of Marlene Dietrich. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell Riva she looks like her late mother and she winces, then replies: "As 
long as it's on the outside . I think she was a beautiful woman -- a gorgeous 
woman. I had great respect for her professionally. But as a human being, I had 
no respect for her at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Lewis or Riva had met before, but when they were introduced, they 
clicked like castanets, first shaking hands, then embracing. "Just call us 
survivors in beige," Riva deadpanned (both women wore neutral knit suits). "We 
share a common Auschwitz, right?" she added. Lewis nodded and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 Both women had tragic tales to tell. Lewis spoke of being raised as Young's 
"adopted" child, though she was really her natural daughter. Riva talked about 
being raised as "the queen's lady-in-waiting." 
</P>
<P>
 "When my mother and father did a film "Call of the Wild" in 1935," Lewis 
began, "my mother was single and Clark Gable was married. 
</P>
<P>
 "The '30s were a different time than today . . . (an announcement of my 
mother's pregnancy) would have ruined their careers." 
</P>
<P>
 So Young had her baby in secret, then pretended to adopt her -- a perfect 
cover-up. "It was all a smoke screen, all fabricated," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was 5, my mother married Tom Lewis and they had two boys. I felt like 
an outsider in my own home." 
</P>
<P>
 When she was 15, she finally got to meet her father. "But I didn't know he was 
my father," Lewis said. "I came home from school and Clark Gable is standing in 
my living room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was overwhelmed by him. We sat down and he asked about my life, school. 
Mother left us alone. I was nervous for a while and then became at ease. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very warm, genuine. To have this time with this man was quite 
enjoyable for me." 
</P>
<P>
 When she was 31, Lewis finally found the courage to confront her mother. She 
had long suspected she was her mother's natural child and had heard talk that 
Gable was her father. 
</P>
<P>
 "I finally said to her: 'Mom . . . is my father Clark Gable?' She said yes, 
and told me the story of how they met and fell in love, how she had to hide me 
from Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis agreed to keep the secret, she said. And then, while studying clinical 
psychology in the '80s, she began to write about her life, using it as a case 
history. "I found as I wrote, it became easier to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to write this book. I don't think anybody knows what it's like not to 
be acknowledged by your own parents. To this day, my mother still does not 
publicly acknowledge that I am her biological child and that Clark Gable is my 
father. I had to claim my identity publicly, in writing." 
</P>
<P>
 How does her 81-year-old mother feel about the book? Lewis, 59, doesn't have a 
clue. "We haven't had a relationship -- haven't spoken -- in eight years," she 
said. "Eight years ago she thought I was writing a book and I wasn't. She asked 
me to leave her home." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the luncheon that preceded the talks, Riva said her tome about Dietrich 
was going to be made into a movie, directed by Louis Malle (husband of Candice 
Bergen). "I can only see Michelle Pffeifer playing my mother," she said. "She 
has just the right amount of arrogance." 
</P>
<P>
 Arrogance indeed. "When you are very beautiful, everything is permissible," 
Riva told the crowd. "Just be beautiful. Be that dashing image and you can get 
away with murder. That's why I wrote the book." 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, Riva confided that she had to emotionally detach herself from her 
mother. "When you live with these legendary creatures, it is the way you 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you try to apply any normal rules or analyses to them you are always going 
to end up with frustration. You have to accept them for what they are and not 
try to be put to death by them, if you are related." 
</P>
<P>
 Did she feel like she had grown up without a mother? "I knew I was a child," 
Riva said. "I didn't know what a mother was. You see, if you don't go to school 
or don't fraternize with 'the little people,' as my mother called them, you 
have nothing to compare with. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Dietrich) was the queen, my father was her major domo, her lovers were her 
suitors, and I was the lady in waiting. I didn't think it was strange; I had 
nothing to compare it to." 
</P>
<P>
 When Dietrich died two years ago in a filthy bed, "bony hands cradling a 
sunken cheek, matchstick legs tucked high against her frail body," Riva writes, 
her first thought was to destroy the bed "so that no one would be able to take 
pictures of her last, terrible leavings," Riva said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dietrich was a sad woman, Riva, 69, told her enraptured audience. "And if you 
find, when you read the book, that you'll stop yourself or a friend from taking 
that one, first pill or first drink, I'll have done my job. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, in her time, she was a fascinating lady and you have to give her that." 
</P>
<P>

 Hoags receive Golden Baton: Talk about a social soldier. Philanthropist George 
Hoag suffered a heart attack a week ago, but that didn't keep him from 
attending a Saturday night gala where he and his wife, Patty, received the 
prestigious Golden Baton Award from the Orange County Philharmonic Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever the jokester, Hoag told 300 music lovers at the Four Seasons Hotel that 
he had "never been one for music appreciation," but that he did have a favorite 
composer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does anybody remember Stewart Hamlin? He was a very famous Western star who 
became a radio minister and made a fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wrote a great song and Patty and I are proud to have a 78 record of it. 
It's called, 'I Won't Go Huntin' With You Jake, but I'll Go Chasin' Women.' " 
I'm sure the Philharmonic would love to have it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack and Nancy Caldwell were co-chairmen of the gala, which celebrated the 
Philharmonic's 40th anniversary season. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Golden Baton winners in attendance were Floss Schumacher, Elaine 
Redfield, Jean Aldrich (on behalf of her late husband, Daniel Aldrich Jr.) and 
John and Donna Crean.

A MAN OF HIS WORDS; WITH A CIVIL TONE AND A PRINCIPLED EYE, MURRAY KEMPTON 
SEARCHES FOR NEW YORK'S MORAL CENTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Russell Miller, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before work one recent morning, Murray Kempton sat in the fake living room 
where they tape "Good Morning America," holding his tongue as Charles Gibson, 
the host, bungled the name of this new book. 
</P>
<P>
 It is "Rebellions, Perversities and Main Events," a selection of Kempton's 
journalism from 1963 through 1992 (Times Books/Random House, 1994). 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson said "Perversions," not "Perversities," fumbling just the kind of 
nuance that has distinguished Kempton's writing for half a century. Murray 
Kempton deals in the criminal, the ethically murky and the unforgivable, but 
rarely in the sexually extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 He did admit, in a 1966 column reprinted in the new collection, that "if the 
pornographic impulse is an obsession with the contemplation of a debased 
object, then I have a dirty mind about Time" -- the news magazine. But sex 
wasn't on his mind. He went on to call Time "a slaughterhouse of moral 
integrity." 
</P>
<P>
 Moral integrity matters to Murray Kempton. So do the faith of the radical, the 
debasement of democracy, and the smallness of great men and women. In 
"Rebellions, Perversities and Main Events," he tracks these themes over a wide 
swath of Western culture. 
</P>
<P>
 He considers Richard Nixon's fight to buy a co-op apartment, the tactics of 
Machiavelli and the blues of Bessie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 He witnesses the rise of Cassius Clay and the fall of Michael Milken with a 
penetrating, principled eye and reports back in prose one might describe as 
American baroque. Kempton won a Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1985 and the 
next year shared a Grammy award for liner notes. His subject was Frank Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Kempton writes for New York Newsday. At 76, he knocks out four 
columns a week on deadline, each one timely enough to read on the morning 
subway, elegant enough for reprint in the intellectually upscale New York 
Review of Books. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a New York City institution, known for rectitude both physical and 
philosophical and for the civility that seemed to prevent him from correcting a 
host, Gibson, in his simulated home. On "Good Morning America," Kempton played 
elder sage in calm, resonant tones. Then he set off to a real day's work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By noon, Murray Kempton was wet. His $5 umbrella wasn't responding. The sky 
was low, gray and windy. Rain fell like heavy tinsel on the sidewalks 
connecting the granite courthouses of lower Manhattan. Deadline was nine hours 
away, and Kempton still needed a topic for his column. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving "Good Morning America," he had stopped at a friend's apartment for 
coffee and a call to Newsday to find out what was scheduled around the city 
that day. The former police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, was giving a talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I love Kelly," Kempton said. "What time?" 
</P>
<P>
 Luncheon. Perhaps Kelly would criticize his successor, William Bratton, and 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, men Kempton finds mean-spirited. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate people attacking people who are only doing their job," he rumbled, 
referring to Bratton's grousing about the local director of the American Civil 
Liberties Union.  
</P>
<P>
 But cover the speech? "I have doubts about that," he said. "I've done Ray so 
often." 
</P>
<P>
 He looked out the window, relit his pipe, tried a call to inquire about court 
dockets. Maybe Tupac Shakur, the rap star charged with sexual assault, would be 
in for a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poor Tupac," Kempton said. "He's been fairly decent." He is a middle-class 
kid who's hung out with a bad element, Kempton continued. "I was hoping to 
touch base with his mama." 
</P>
<P>
 Shakur was not scheduled to appear this day. Nothing of interest leaped out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'll go down to criminal court and dig around," he announced, draping 
a bead-chain of press tags over his dark blue suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Kempton is famous for riding a bicycle around New York, but the weather was 
rotten and he hadn't been on the bike all winter. Dodging puddles and 
construction barriers, striding toward the subway, he explained how he arrives 
at each day's topic: "You make a bad choice in the morning. Then you get back 
to the office at 4, and you hope you don't have to stick with the morning's bad 
choice." This morning's choices were as bleak as the weather. He didn't want to 
write about Bill Clinton or Bosnia or Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 In the press room at police headquarters downtown, he greeted Newsday's beat 
reporter. "What have you got for me, Willie? Murder? Death?" Willie had nothing 
but a luncheon speech -- Ray Kelly. Maybe he'd say something about Commissioner 
Bratton. 
</P>
<P>
 Kempton picked up his earlier theme: "Bratton slams people who are just doing 
their job. Isn't the head of the Citizens' Budget Commission supposed to 
criticize the city budget? Isn't the ACLU supposed to do what they do? I don't 
understand America." But he still didn't see Kelly as a column. 
</P>
<P>
 Sloshing through the alleys of the court district, Kempton headed for the 
Manhattan district attorney's office. He dropped in on Linda Fairstein, chief 
of the sex crimes unit. She confirmed that Tupac wouldn't be in and offered up 
sentencing for a Mitsubishi executive who violently raped a colleague, then 
sought to apologize over lunch. The victim went to the restaurant wired. The 
cops taped the pitiful confession. The whole thing was sordid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think," Kempton told Fairstein, "he should be disposed of without being 
held up to the hue and cry of the public." Then he mused: "Why are things so 
stagnant? Is it me?" It was 11:15. 
</P>
<P>
 In the elevator, a chatty lawyer tried to interest Kempton in the case of a 
client on trial for setting fire to the testicles of a brothel owner. 
Downstairs, Newsday's court correspondent proposed a column on the way lawyers 
had deceived the former P.R. adviser to Marla Maples, convicted of burglarizing 
the Maples shoe closet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone says I'm friendly to reporters," said Kempton, back on the street, 
his pipe upside down to keep the rain out. "Now you see why. I need them." 
</P>
<P>
 Five decades of published writing to the contrary, Kempton disavows praise for 
his reporting. He calls himself "a master of all trades and a jack of none," 
referring wryly to his "legend," his "air of authority" and his "affectations." 
</P>
<P>
 He works without special sources, he says, but a few hours with him on the 
hunt demonstrate his confident handle on the undramatic, essential tools of 
reporting: genial acquaintance with both secretaries and brass, graceful 
curiosity, a rich historical memory, the wisdom to draw connections, the sense 
to tell right from wrong. Plus the tenacity of a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 From one courthouse to another, past metal detectors and back-door guards, up 
one well-worn grand staircase, down another overburdened elevator, Kempton 
clipped along. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you," he told secretaries, leaving their domains empty-handed. "It was 
a joy as always." 
</P>
<P>
 He bemoaned his goose chase with an accustomed despair. Around noon, he ducked 
into a dry courtroom for the Mitsubishi-rapist sentencing, just in case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," he observed as it ended, "I have nothing to say about that. Poor 
girl." His body sat bolt upright. His spirit seemed to slump. The clock was 
pushing 1, eight hours to deadline. "I'm going back to the office and brood. 
I've wasted my day." 
</P>
<P>
 A young member of the district attorney's staff piped up, "No, you haven't. 
You were wonderful on 'Good Morning America' this morning." 
</P>
<P>
 He wouldn't know, Kempton said. He'd stopped looking at himself on TV 31 years 
ago -- a year before the D.A.'s aide was born. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kempton began reporting in 1942. He grew up in Baltimore, descendant of 
distinguished Southerners he gets tired of talking about, particularly the 
namesake who wrote the federal law forcing runaway slaves back south. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a statute of limitations," he impresses upon an interviewer, "on 
writing the Fugitive Slave Act." 
</P>
<P>
 It was in the South, at the dawn of the Civil Rights movement, that Kempton 
produced some of his most memorable work. Through the '50s and early '60s, he 
covered the hearings on the witch hunts of Sen. Joe McCarthy, the enmeshment of 
labor leaders and mob bosses, the rise of world leaders from Billy Graham to 
Nikita Khrushchev, all for the New York Post. The rough, loose-lipped tabloid 
gave him room to stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 A volume called "America Comes of Middle Age," now out of print, collected 
Kempton's columns from those years. Around the time it appeared, in 1963, he 
left newspapering. He worked for a while at the New Republic, then wrote an 
award-winning book about the trial of a group of Black Panthers. But by 1977, 
he was back to the daily deadline. Even a week's time to write, he says, was 
too much. You over-report. You fret. And you come up with nothing better than 
you'd have teased out against the clock in a noisy newsroom. 
</P>
<P>
 As the hours ticked by at Newsday that afternoon, another reporter turned in a 
four-paragraph brief on the sentencing of the Mitsubishi manager. The editors 
decided that Ray Kelly's lunchtime critique of his police department successors 
merited not only a full report, but a transcript on the Op-Ed pages. 
</P>
<P>
 Kempton would be in the Op-Ed package too, with a reprint of his foreword to 
"Rebellions, Perversities and Main Events." There he wrote, in a flourish 
worthy of Walt Whitman, "I write every day for the next and walk wide of the 
cosmic and settle most happily for the local." 
</P>
<P>
 But having forgone Kelly and the corporate rapist, what would Kempton settle 
for that day? 
</P>
<P>
 About 740,000 readers found the answer on page A13 the next morning: Murray 
Kempton on Mayor Giuliani, Police Commissioner Bratton and civility. It was the 
thorn that had needled him over coffee -- Bratton's sniping at his critics. It 
was the stew that had simmered inside him as he wound his way through the 
courts and the rain. He wrote of the budget and civil liberties watchdogs as 
he'd spoken: "They are doing what they are paid to do, and their utterances 
would be proper cause for such offense only if they weren't." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he wrote something more, praising the critics over the thin-skinned 
officials: "No man serves us better than the one who accepts his faith, labors 
in its vocation, and takes his pay and works to earn it by devotion to his 
task." 
</P>
<P>
 A commuter scanning those lines on the subway would be hard-pressed to devise 
a more accurate tribute to Murray Kempton, reporter, himself.

CAN THIS MARRIAGE BE SAVED?: COMMITMENTS; IF YOU HAVE TO FIGHT, REMEMBER THE 
RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By By the Editors of Ladies' Home Journal 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "My husband and I have totally different ideas about how to discipline kids, 
and because of this, our life is chaos and nonstop battling," says Ann, 38. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to do it all, and I'm doing a lousy job. But it would be nice if 
my husband gave me some support. Instead, we wind up yelling and screaming in 
front of the children. That only makes things worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Ann can't help wondering if the fact that she's working full time, even though 
it's a job she loves, is making her problems worse. Not that she has any choice 
-- her husband of nine years, Tom, lost his job in companywide layoffs six 
months ago, and he's having trouble finding a comparable position. 
</P>
<P>
 But discipline is the trigger for their daily fights. Mornings and bedtimes 
are excruciating, she says: "The kids fight with each other and they fight with 
me. Janie, the 5-year-old, is fresh and insists on having the last word. And 
Tommy Jr., who's 4, is acting up in preschool." 
</P>
<P>
 Ann says Tom thinks the kids need a good spanking, but she doesn't believe in 
that and prefers to talk things out with her children. Tom's methods sound like 
boot camp to her. Drained from juggling her many roles, Ann finds her mood 
swinging from frustration to despair, and by the time she gets into bed she 
says she's "wound up like a corkscrew. This is not the kind of marriage I want 
to have." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom, also 38, feels the same way. He's convinced that Ann spoils the kids by 
giving them far too many options. "You don't ask children what kind of cereal 
they want for breakfast," he says, "you tell them."  
</P>
<P>
 Ann complains that she wants his help, but she doesn't mean it, he says: "Ann 
always thinks she can do everything better than anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 "How to reconcile different styles of discipline is a common problem for many 
couples," says Antoinette Saunders, a clinical psychologist in Evanston, Ill. 
But before couples like Ann and Tom can negotiate compromises and calmly 
discuss strategies, they have to get a handle on their fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Every couple has heard the admonishments about arguing in front of their 
children and the critical need to present a united front at all times. But no 
two partners are carbon copies of each other. Disagreements are bound to arise 
and, when they do, it's crucial to remember that it's not whether you fight but 
how you handle the fight that's important. In fact, it can teach your children 
a valuable lesson about expressing feelings and resolving differences. 
</P>
<P>
 If you and your husband find yourselves arguing in front of your children, try 
to keep the following rules in mind: 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid name-calling, insults and sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
 * Try not to lapse into angry silences. Emotional distances can be scarier for 
kids than outright fighting because they just don't understand them. 
</P>
<P>
 * When you're really furious, agree to disagree; call a timeout when tempers 
get too hot to handle. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't threaten to leave or get a divorce. In the heat of anger we often say 
things we don't mean, but children don't know that.

COMMITMENTS; ALL THE RAGE; REMEMBER WHEN YOU TIED YOUR SISTER UP? TOLD YOUR

CHILDHOOD FEELINGS OF HURT AND ANGER

 Parents are always telling their kids to get along with one another. But 
increasingly, therapists say, the adults need someone to do the same for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it sib strain -- when juvenile jealousies, childhood squabbles or 
long-forgotten insults -- can erupt into disa greements, verbal battles or even 
all-out hostility between adult siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are realizing that the sibling relationship is important, especially 
in this crazy society. I deal with it every day with my patients," said Barbara 
Cadow, a USC clinical psychologist with a private practice in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Therapists say the seeds of sibling stress are sown in childhood when parents 
model ineffective communication styles or allow rivalries to go unchecked. 
Almost without exception, those who suffer from sibling feuds have grown up in 
families in which successive generations have failed to learn how to talk to 
each other and listen, Cadow said. The result, sometimes long after everyone is 
officially grown up, is angry siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is usually triggered by stress -- a wedding, a holiday, an 
illness, a funeral or a will. "People are raw emotionally and then the issues 
come out," said Cadow, who recently counseled two sisters wrangling over a 
will. 
</P>
<P>
 Sibling therapy is a lot like marriage counseling -- except both patients have 
the same parents, Cadow said. In the case of the two sisters, both had long 
felt deprived of love, attention and reinforcement, and learned that they were 
holding each other responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "It worked out, in a very emotional session. They both realized that neither 
of them had gotten what they felt they needed," Cadow said. And they stopped 
fighting over the will. 
</P>
<P>
 A 73-year-old Northridge woman who asked to remain anonymous said she has 
still not resolved completely the tension she feels with her three siblings. "I 
grew up and was put in a little category; I had the label of being bright, and 
my younger sister had the label of being pretty, with personality, dimples and 
all that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, at the wedding reception for her second marriage, one of her 
brothers turned to her and said he had never noticed that she was so beautiful. 
She bristled. "I told him, right then, that I didn't think any of them had ever 
looked at me," she said. "He was shocked." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, Westwood-based psychologist Arlen Ring said, one of the kids gets 
the feeling the other sibling's role came easier. "One sibling may have been 
the rebel and the other, a good little girl. Neither appreciates the price the 
other had to pay for refuge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He sees a growing number of people seeking sibling-related therapy. Usually, 
some occasion becomes a flash point and a fight ensues. "For some, it's like a 
bomb waiting to go off," he said. Money is a big issue around which things 
break, as are celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, Ring said, the siblings discover that they grew up in a 
dysfunctional family in which the parents had so many unmet needs that they 
were not able to provide a forum for the family to communicate. Rather than 
feeling like everyone was working together and on the same side, children in 
such situations may have grown up seeing each other as players who would move 
against each other if given an opening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all model the kind of behaviors we've primarily been exposed to," said 
Barry Slone, a clinical psychologist with offices in Orange and Laguna Hills. 
"If you assume the parental relationship is one of the more powerful 
educational experiences, I don't think it's a stretch to draw the conclusion 
that if you grew up in a family where people could express their point of view, 
negotiate and constructively solve problems, you're going to have a better 
relationship with your sibling." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 David Paster, an Encino psychologist, uses the acronym RAGE -- rivalry, anger, 
greed and envy -- to explain the sibling stress he sees among the adults he 
treats. He says the combination of those four emotions creates the tension that 
is increasingly being experienced among grown siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 It's common, Paster said, for adult siblings to remember something said 
decades ago. One client recently told his brother that he cannot forget that, 
at 14, he told him that he would hate him for the rest of his life. The issues, 
Paster said, are often not even remembered by the other sibling or may be 
recalled very differently. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes memory is selective. One woman clearly remembers her brother tying 
her to a piano bench with a jump rope when she was 8. What she does not recall 
is why he did it. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues can spring up deep into adulthood. Cheryl Heitman, a family therapist 
in Agoura, said she often sees sibs who have gotten along well, even into their 
30s and 40s, until some problem opens an old, even unremembered, rift. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're reacting from old feelings, feelings from when you were 5, and then 
you revert to those deep, familiar behavior patterns," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitman said she also has counseled adults who found that issues with their 
siblings were getting worse as they all aged, without any particular event or 
crisis as a cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people, as they get older, instead of their issues getting resolved, 
it gets worse. We all have expectations of how we ought to be treated and we 
have these expectations even more for family. So it's very easy to be left out, 
disappointed or frustrated. And most families don't make it a habit to talk 
about the dynamics of their relationships," Heitman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the precipitating factor is a sibling's spouse. Cadow said one 
patient she has counseled was extremely close to her brother but saw the 
relationship slide after he got married. "The wife tried to keep the brother 
away from his sister; she practiced phone sabotage," Cadow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? "It's hardly ever communicated in these situations so it's hard to know 
what it's about," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Making up isn't easy. Cadow remembered one patient who had problems with all 
his siblings but carefully selected the one with whom he was closest. He 
planned out what he would say, how he would begin the conversation and phoned. 
The brother hung up on him. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to be prepared for an overture to fail," Cadow said. The best bet, 
she advised, is for troubled sibs to try to talk in a neutral, public place -- 
such as a restaurant -- where inhibitions may make the discussion more calm and 
controlled. 
</P>
<P>
 Cadow suggests that sibs start by reminiscing -- sharing silly stories in an 
effort to regain common ground. Keep it low-key, go slowly, don't blame and 
don't go in with huge expectations. "Be happy if you can meet and not fight," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologists say just having children of their own sometimes spurs siblings 
to seek therapy. Watching the kids interact can resurrect long-buried, 
conflicting feelings of both fun and frustration, and stimulate a desire for 
the new generation of children to do better. 
</P>
<P>
 How can parents nip sib strain in the bud? Paster said parents should be 
careful not to assume that sibling rage is normal. "It's not," he said. "Kids 
should be encouraged to talk about their feelings with each other and to treat 
each other well." 
</P>
<P>
 Slone said parents should feel comfortable stepping into the situation when 
they see their children at each other's throats. The theory that the grown-ups 
should let the kids work it out themselves usually does not work, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adults can help the siblings calm down," he said, "and then assist them in 
expressing why they are fighting and what they want."

COMMITMENTS; WHAT PARENTS CAN DO TO HELP

<P>
 Psychologists say there are several approaches parents can take to help ease 
the friction they see between their children. 
</P>
<P>
 * Step in when the children are fighting and help calm them.Then assist each 
in expressing his or her perception of the problem, and help them work out an 
amicable, win-win solution, if possible. 
</P>
<P>
 * Examine the communication style of the household in which you were raised 
and consider whether you are subconsciously carrying on any of the patterns 
that were not effective then. Look at how you communicate with your spouse when 
there is a disagreement or a frustration situation. Realize that parental 
communication serves as a model to the children. 
</P>
<P>
 * Help the children see the pros and the cons of their birth order. For 
example, discuss with an older child that while the new baby may get lots of 
cuddling and other attention, he or she gets time alone with a parent at the 
park or other privileges. Helping children see the benefits and the drawbacks 
-- from both sides -- may help minimize envy or hurt feelings.

YO-YO ENTREPRENEUR HAD TO PULL SOME STRINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1929, struggling businessman Donald F. Duncan paid an uninvited visit to 
the San Simeon mansion of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst. 
</P>
<P>
 Duncan had just started his own company that made yo-yos, a little-known 
spinning top on a string, and he needed a way to promote business. He talked 
his way past a butler and into a room with Hearst. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearst snapped at his visitor to quickly state his business. Duncan detailed a 
scheme that would sell newspapers and yo-yos. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, Hearst's newspapers would advertise Duncan-sponsored yo-yo 
contests in which youngsters would compete for bicycles and sporting goods. In 
return, Duncan would require competitors to obtain three new subscriptions as 
entry fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearst liked the idea, but the public's acceptance was simply phenomenal. A 
30-day campaign in the Philadelphia Daily News sold more than 3 million yo-yos. 
Newspapers soon began publishing photographs of such celebrities as Bing Crosby 
and Jack Benny dangling yo-yos from their fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next three decades, Duncan had the world on a string. 
</P>
<P>
 He hired a team of yo-yo demonstrators to tour the world. Duncan's line of 
Imperials, Tournaments and Butterflies spun off the assembly line by the 
thousands. He became wealthy almost overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Duncan, who died in 1971 at 78, didn't invent the yo-yo, he just refined it. 
He spotted the toy in 1927, when Pedro Flores, a busboy in a Santa Monica 
hotel, began entertaining guests with spinning wooden spools he had learned to 
make in his native Philippines. Flores began marketing the toy, but Duncan soon 
bought him out. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1932, the U.S. Patent Office issued Duncan a trademark for the word yo-yo , 
a word derived from the Tagalog meaning come come . Competitors were forced to 
call their products Whirl-A-Gigs, Cheerios or Royal Return Tops. 
</P>
<P>
 But efforts to challenge Duncan's claim to the trademark mounted over the 
years. In 1965, Duncan's company, financially drained by legal expenses and 
overextended by advertising costs, was forced into bankruptcy. That same year, 
a Federal Court of Appeals ruled that the trademark was invalid because the 
word yo-yo was the name of the toy itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, the yo-yo belonged to the world. In 1965, what was left of Duncan's 
company was purchased by Flambeau Products, which continues to operate Duncan 
Toys as a subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mistake we made was trying to fight the trademark battle," says Donald F. 
Duncan Jr., who in 1988 started his own yo-yo company, Playmaxx, in Tucson. "We 
spent thousands trying to keep it."

CALIFORNIA COMMENTARY; HANDICAPPED BY OUR ATTITUDE; RAILROADS, EXPENSIVE 
HIGHWAYS, MILITARY BASES, WATER PROJECTS -- THE FEDS DON'T OWE US, THE FEDS 
CREATED US. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC REISNER, Marc Reisner, author of Cadillac Desert, (Viking-Penguin), is 
writing a book about contemporary California. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I lived in New York in the 1970s and the appallingly run city government 
finally tottered into bankruptcy, Mayor Abraham Beame went to Washington to 
request a loan from President Ford and got a reply that the New York Daily News 
conjured into the most memorable headline of the decade: "Ford to City: Drop 
Dead." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a wonderful banner, capturing the arrogance, self-absorption and acute 
denial that prompted most Americans to resent, if not detest, New York. So what 
if it was the financial and cultural capital of the modern universe? Why should 
American taxpayers rescue a city with 362,849 full-time employees on the public 
payroll in 1974 that considered itself too broke to replace its Depression-era 
subway cars or fix an elevated highway that once swallowed a Mercedes?  
</P>
<P>
 Recently, I came across a remark from a Los Angeles politician that may be 
destined for the same immortality as that New York headline. Assemblywoman 
Paula L. Boland (R-Granada Hills) was explaining her tireless opposition to 
even a modest and temporary state sales-tax surcharge earmarked for earthquake 
relief. "Californians are taxed to death," she said. "The feds are going to 
have to come through for us. The President owes us. . . . They've taken our 
military bases and all those jobs. They're going to have to start giving 
something back to California." 
</P>
<P>
 Stop that assemblywoman! The rest of the country resents us enough already. 
Don't they look out here and see a paradise: our heart-stopping coastline, the 
Sierra Nevada and the redwoods, the fabulous food, the movie stars, the sex- 
and drug-suffused lives that people lead in places like Fullerton? 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, during a couple of recent trips to the heartland where many of us 
originated, I detected, for the first time, some genuine pity for California, 
which Boland threatens to zap in the bud. Some Americans have finally 
recognized California for what it is -- a phony paradise whose habitation 
involves substantial risk and, when disaster inevitably strikes, tremendous 
upheaval and cost. Four of the 10 most expensive "natural" disasters in U.S. 
history -- the Loma Prieta and Northridge earthquakes, the Oakland fire and 
last autumn's Southland wildfire siege -- have occurred here within the past 
five years. But how long can you pity a place where misfortunes never cease and 
are the result, in large part, of others' generosity and a peculiar, nativist 
willfulness? 
</P>
<P>
 The feds owe us? California is in many ways an invention of federal largess. 
The first paradise seekers who arrived here came mainly by rail, on 
transcontinental track whose construction was subsidized by the frontier 
government's principal currency, land.  
</P>
<P>
 Once here, the seekers saw what paradise lacked -- water -- and so, with the 
secret connivance of the federal government, Los Angeles managed to snaffle 
lots of it from the Owens Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 When that source was soon over-tapped, the federal government erected Hoover 
Dam, then the largest on Earth, mainly for California's benefit. Later, it 
built part of the State Water Project so Southern California could grow more 
crowded and rich. In case agriculture felt slighted, the despised feds built 
the Central Valley Project, which is still the planet's grandest webwork of 
dams and aqueducts, and much of a levee system along the Sacramento River that 
rivals the Mississippi's. CVP irrigation water is ludicrously subsidized, at 
the expense of many struggling farmers in the South and Midwest; the levees and 
flood control were essentially free. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers elsewhere paid for most of California's interstate highway system, 
which was even more expensive that it is extensive. A single mile of the 
Century Freeway -- a multilane, elevated, earthquake-proof monstrosity that was 
reamed through expensive, if decrepit, real estate -- cost almost as much as 
interstates laid across some small states, even if you factor inflation. 
Washington "took" so many of our military bases because it gave us so many, 
even before the defense spending of the Reagan and Bush years, which laid out a 
smorgasbord worth probably $200 billion to Southern California alone. 
</P>
<P>
 So what do we want now? Many of our politicians, including the governor, 
subscribe to the interesting notion that the rest of the country should pay 
whenever California burns up or dries up or drowns or falls apart. After 
Northridge (and despite much grumbling by members from geologically boring 
states), Congress voted us $8.6 billion in emergency relief, and now the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency is sitting down to the 360,000 applications 
for assistance it has received to date (an all-time record, despite two 
horrendous recent hurricanes). The wildfires prompted further aid from 
Washington, as did the drought, the floods and the $850-million crop freeze in 
1990 that no one remembers any more. 
</P>
<P>
 What will happen when -- as many seismologists predict sometime in the next 30 
years -- the Hayward Fault under Oakland and Berkeley slips, causing as much as 
$240 billion worth of destruction? Will Boland's counterparts say that American 
taxpayers should rebuild everything? What happens when the Big One jostles 
several trillion dollars' worth of real estate down here? 
</P>
<P>
 If Californians wish to preserve whatever national goodwill they still own, 
they should force their candidates (who are also asking for more legitimate aid 
to deal with such burdens as illegal immigration) to address these questions. 
They might also ask who is subsidizing whom within the state. Why, for example, 
should homeowners at low fire risk subsidize others -- which they do, through 
assigned-risk insurance pools -- who insist on building in the worst wildfire 
habitat on Earth?  
</P>
<P>
 There is, of course, much to be said for the government's huge investments in 
California. We dominate some of the economy's strongest sectors -- aerospace, 
agriculture, entertainment. We may soon represent a fifth of the gross national 
product; all of that productivity and wealth keep most of us here.  
</P>
<P>
 But Californians, like New Yorkers in the 1970s, have developed not so much a 
bad attitude as a blind attitude, which is worse. In the wake of the wildfire 
siege, I listened to a radio talk-show host congratulate a caller who was 
determined to rebuild a Malibu home that he had already rebuilt after the 
wildfire of 1970. Now that, said the host, is rugged individualism. It's a good 
thing they don't broadcast such nonsense to Iowa, where they see it as sending 
taxes to Sean Penn.
