 LEADER: Orange County is paradise for managed health care organizations. HMOs 
and preferred provider organizations have signed up four of every five 
households here, the best showing of any large urban area in the nation. . . . 
The reasons? Probably the early aggressiveness of Orange County businesses, 
quick to switch their group insurance to the lower-cost managed plans, says one 
hospital official. "And it doesn't hurt that two of the largest HMOs (FHP and 
PacifiCare) are headquartered here." 
</P>
<P>
 A NEW PAGE: That most common of hospital sounds -- doctors being paged over 
public address systems -- will be missing from the rooms and corridors of the 
Anaheim Memorial Hospital's new birthing center. A computer, sensing tiny 
infrared transmitters worn by staffers, will locate hospital personnel 
instantly, then open the nearest intercom. . . . "We're the first to have this 
west of the Mississippi," says a spokeswoman. "This is going to prevent our 
running around trying to locate people when you need them urgently. To us, it's 
a very big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 MORE ROOM: Starting in March, Orange County will have a second location for 
treatment of the most serious burns. . . . Joining the UCI Medical Center will 
be Martin Luther Hospital in Anaheim, which will open a six-bed burn unit named 
after the unit's medical director, burn specialist Dr. A. Richard Grossman. . . 
. "Our studies showed it is needed," says a spokeswoman. "Last fiscal year we 
had 250 burn cases come to our emergency room, and half of them needed 
hospitalization." 
</P>
<P>
 DOGGIE BOWSER M.D.: Man's best friend has a pretty good bedside manner too. . 
. . The two most popular volunteers at Children's Hospital of Orange County are 
a German shepherd named Beck and a Labrador retriever named Stella. Their 
weekly visits help kids with speech and motor skill exercises, says therapist 
Joy Weingartner. . . . "A lot of these kids just light up when the dog walks 
in. You can see their spirits rise. For that moment they forget they're in a 
hospital." Managing Health

 BARNUM CATCHES ON: A list of home-grown football players who now are bound for 
postseason bowl games might start with Terry Barnum, a former star at Alemany 
High in Mission Hills. . . . Barnum expected to earn a starting position at 
USC, but not this position. A tailback in high school, Barnum is now a 
pass-catching fullback. After a loss to UCLA and Saturday's 17-17 tie with 
Notre Dame, USC's bowl picture remains cloudy. 
</P>
<P>
 GALLOPING BUFFALO: It has been a whirlwind season for Christian Fauria, tight 
end of bowl-bound Colorado (10-1). Fauria, from Crespi High in Encino, is a 
probable NFL draft choice. He has caught more passes than any tight end in 
Colorado history (98), and ESPN had Fauria act out a facetious football fantasy 
during a midseason telecast. 
</P>
<P>
 TWO WILD CATS: Arizona is angling for a trip to the Freedom Bowl in Anaheim 
Dec. 27 and running back Ontiwaun Carter (above) and wide receiver Richard Dice 
are leading the way. Carter, from Kennedy High in Granada Hills, and Dice, from 
Alemany, are Arizona's two best offensive players. Carter has set the Arizona 
career rushing record with 3,457 yards. Dice has 56 receptions for 969 yards 
and eight touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 CHRISTMAS GIFT: He's one of the area's best players, but his team won't be 
going to a bowl game. UCLA quarterback Wayne Cook of Newbury Park High 
engineered the Bruins' stunning 31-19 upset of USC just over a week ago, a 
victory that helped assuage the pain of a 5-6 season. . . . Cook will play in 
the Blue-Gray all-star game in Montgomery, Ala., on Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
 GREAT TIP: Four years ago, Utah wide receiver Curtis Marsh was a talent 
awaiting discovery. He played in only three football games at Simi Valley High 
and came to the attention of Moorpark College coaches after he was seen making 
slam dunks in a basketball game at a nearby park. It was a good tip. Marsh has 
61 receptions and 11 touchdown catches. . . . Utah will play in the Freedom 
Bowl. Dana Haddad

 CLASS ACT: Friends and colleagues remembered Thomas G. Lakin on Sunday as a 
man who dedicated his entire career to education. . . . The popular chancellor 
of the Ventura County Community College District died Sunday (A1), the first 
known fatality from the so-called flesh-eating bacteria in California. . . . 
"He was a visionary," said Elise Schneider, president of Oxnard College (B1). 
"He cared for people in our district and was a tremendous leader." 
</P>
<P>
 TREES, PLEASE: The pumpkin patches that took up vacant lots and fields around 
the county are giving way to Christmas trees. . . . And not a moment too soon 
for those eager to embrace the season. In Ojai, where the Bower Tree Farm 
opened over the long Thanksgiving weekend, business has taken off at a good 
clip. "It started slow, but people are really starting to come in," said 
Marilyn Bower, whose family has run the five-acre site for 25 years. . . . 
Nationwide, more than 34 million trees are expected to be sold by Christmas 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
 SAND BLAST: Once, the water in Mugu Lagoon was deep enough to allow U. S. Navy 
boats to maneuver, but no longer. . . . Now, about 240 million tons a year of 
sand and silt are pouring into the lagoon from a series of creeks and arroyos 
(B1). A report says the fresh-water infusion is threatening habitat in Southern 
California's largest remaining salt marsh. . . . But don't rush out to see the 
lagoon -- you'll need special Navy permission, a restriction that the report 
recommends be relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
 GETTING YOUNGER?: Oxnard leads the county's 10 cities in birthrates, according 
to a recent study (B1). . . . Birthrates were lowest in Thousand Oaks, Simi 
Valley and Camarillo. . . . That's right in line with recent state figures 
showing that only 7.7% of Oxnard residents are senior citizens. In Moorpark -- 
another city with higher birth rates -- just 3.8% of residents are over the age 
of 65. . . . Looks as if the crunch for space in some of the county's schools 
won't end any time soon.

$70 MILLION IN COINS RECOVERED OFF OMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Treasure hunters said Sunday that they have recovered silver coins worth $70 
million from the wreck of a U.S. merchant ship torpedoed by a German U-boat -- 
just a small part of what they hope still to find. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheik Ahmad Farid al Aulaqi, the owner of the rights to salvage the treasure 
from the vessel John Barry, said his team has raised about 1.5 million silver 
coins. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the team hopes in early 1995 to retrieve the remaining treasure of 
more than 2,000 tons of silver ingots and coins. 
</P>
<P>
 The John Barry was loaded "under conditions of great secrecy" in the United 
States during World War II, said a spokesman for the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 It was torpedoed in 1944 by a German submarine and broke in half, slipping to 
a depth of 8,500 feet, about 125 miles off the coast of Oman.

STREET SMART: THOSE ENDLESS FREIGHT TRAINS DON'T FOLLOW A SCHEDULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Do you know whether there is a published schedule of freight trains that cross 
Imperial Highway where it is intersected by Orangethorpe Avenue/Esperanza Road? 
Trains of more than 100 cars seem to pass through during the busiest part of a 
rush hour, and some advance notice might help alleviate the traffic backup on 
Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, why can't cars turning left from Esperanza to southbound Imperial 
Highway ever get the first green light after the train passes through, 
especially during the morning rush hour when cars are backed up past Fairmont 
Boulevard? 
</P>
<P>
 Royce Orleans Hurst 
</P>
<P>
 Yorba Linda 
</P>
<P>
 The Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway does not publish a timetable for 
freight trains because they don't run on set schedules, said Bob Harper, a 
company spokesman. Rather, they run as business dictates. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose Orem, spokeswoman for Caltrans, which runs the traffic signals there, 
said the first green light after a freight train crosses always goes to north- 
and southbound Imperial Highway, because the biggest traffic backups are there. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 During the evening rush hours, Imperial Highway between Santa Ana Canyon Road 
and Orangethorpe Avenue is a real mess. The cause is the traffic lights at 
Santa Ana Canyon Road and La Palma Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Many drivers getting off the Riverside Freeway and others southbound on 
Imperial want to turn left on Santa Ana Canyon Road. The distance from the 
freeway to Santa Ana Canyon Road is small and the left-turn light is short. 
Some drivers cannot completely cross the exit ramp intersection, blocking the 
way for drivers turning left from the exit ramp to northbound Imperial. 
</P>
<P>
 At La Palma, drivers southbound on Imperial turning left to eastbound La Palma 
are given an extended green light, causing northbound Imperial traffic to back 
up to the Riverside Freeway exit ramp. The majority of cars using this portion 
of Imperial Highway will go east on Santa Ana Canyon Road, La Palma Avenue or 
Esperanza Road. 
</P>
<P>
 This problem is further worsened by the usual traffic jam on the eastbound 
Riverside Freeway, which usually begins at Imperial Highway. If it were not for 
the Riverside Freeway problems, many drivers would continue on to Weir Canyon 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the Lakeview Avenue exit is somewhat better since most cars are coming 
from the Riverside Freeway, but making that left turn onto Lakeview is 
difficult because the two traffic lights on Santa Ana Canyon Road are close 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Heins 
</P>
<P>
 Yorba Linda 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic jams in this area have been a problem for well over a decade because 
the traffic volume has grown so much that it exceeds the capacity originally 
intended for this freeway, said Rose Orem. Signal coordination on local streets 
would not significantly reduce the congestion, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Drivers trying to bypass freeway congestion use parallel roads such as La 
Palma and Santa Ana Canyon and overtax these local streets, Orem said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is some good news. Construction of an express toll road on the 
Riverside Freeway is two-thirds done, Orem said. This project will add two 
lanes in each direction from the Orange Freeway to beyond the Riverside county 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 The new lanes are expected to greatly relieve the congestion on local streets 
as well as the freeway, Orem said. Caltrans estimates that the lanes will be 
open by the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 What determines the timing of metered traffic lights on freeway on-ramps? In 
my driving around Orange County, it appears that the majority change on a 
two-to three-second interval. 
</P>
<P>
 But the on-ramp from Jeffrey Road/University Drive in Irvine to the San Diego 
Freeway is six to seven seconds, no matter what the traffic is like on the 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 And only one car is allowed through at a time (except for car-pool cars). Why 
is this? 
</P>
<P>
 There is always a very long backup when the meter is on during rush-hour 
traffic, even when the San Diego Freeway is moving quite nicely. Please 
explain. 
</P>
<P>
 Penny Joss Fletcher 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 The criteria used for determining the interval timing for ramp meters in 
Orange County is based on the volume of traffic at the ramp as well as the 
upstream and downstream traffic on the freeway, Orem said. The timing can vary 
from four seconds to 20 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans engineers checked out the ramp meter at the Jeffrey/University 
on-ramp and determined it was set correctly for the present conditions, Orem 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the ramp metering is to control the flow of oncoming traffic to 
the freeway by balancing the demand and capacity. The fact that the freeway is 
"moving quite nicely" is an indication that metering is working, Orem said.

THE DYING OF MUGU LAGOON; REPORT URGES CONTROL OF SILT RUNOFF FROM UPSTREAM 
EROSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Schwartz pauses on a cracking concrete dock on the Point Mugu Navy base, 
surveying the rising salt marsh and dry land around him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailors used to navigate 20-foot boats to the dock at the edge of Mugu Lagoon 
as late as the 1960s. But just recently, Schwartz and another Navy ecologist 
ventured out in a shallow-draft canoe; "we bottomed out," Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 240 million tons of sediment sweep into Mugu Lagoon every year, 
building up sand bars for lolling harbor seals and resting shore birds where 
there once was deep water. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny grains of sand and silt are carried by runoff down a web of creeks 
and arroyos that fall from the hills above Simi Valley, Moorpark, Camarillo and 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent report on the 343-mile Calleguas Creek watershed says the 
accelerating flow of fresh water and sediment threatens the habitat of 
endangered and other rare species in Southern California's largest remaining 
salt marsh. 
</P>
<P>
 The infusion of fresh water decreases salinity, killing some fish adapted to 
salt marsh, the two-year study says. It also carries pesticides from farms 
upstream and urban pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
 The accompanying sediment is burying eelgrass beds that provide a nursery for 
fish, the report says, and it is covering a delicate ecosystem under tons of 
mud and sand. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the loss of wetlands elsewhere, this area takes on an increasingly 
important role for migratory birds as a stopover on the Pacific Flyway," said 
Sheri Klittich, a soil conservationist with the Natural Resources Conservation 
Service of the U. S. Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Mugu Lagoon also provides food and shelter to the endangered American 
peregrine falcon, California least tern, light-footed clapper rail and 
California brown pelican, the report said. In addition, it is one of the few 
remaining places in Southern California where harbor seals pup. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, written by Klittich's co-workers with help from local, state and 
federal officials, suggests a variety of tactics to control farmland erosion. 
</P>
<P>
 It also recommends that county flood control officials build concrete and 
earthen structures, including a major catch basin just upstream near Pacific 
Coast Highway, to capture the sediment before it pours into the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The report acknowledges that it cannot determine exactly when Mugu Lagoon 
would be filled, given the influence of ocean tides and other factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it cites an earlier study that projected most of the area will rise to 
five feet above sea level in about 40 years, shrinking the lagoon to a fraction 
of its present size. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz, who helps lead a team of Navy biologists, is not so sure about the 
imminent doom of the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 He sees another force of nature at play: A deep canyon in the ocean floor has 
started sucking away the Navy base's shoreline like a huge sinkhole. The 
300-foot-deep marine canyon, which stretches miles off the coast, has starting 
moving inland. 
</P>
<P>
 It has already gobbled up the 200-foot-wide beach that used to protect the 
base's old officer's club and other recreational facilities on a spit of sand 
between the ocean and Mugu Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy crews have chopped off the end of the pier that slumped into the canyon. 
Now a huge rock seawall protecting Navy buildings has begun to slide into the 
submarine trench. Schwartz said the Navy plans to retreat from the advancing 
ocean, demolishing two buildings standing in its way. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary studies predict that the canyon will continue to eat away at the 
spit until the ocean connects with the lagoon within 20 to 40 years, Schwartz 
said. "When that happens, it could end the sediment problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The flow of silt and sand is as old as the Oxnard Plain itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Sediment has washed down these creeks and the nearby Santa Clara and Ventura 
rivers for eons, fanning out across the Oxnard Plain to deposit a rich layer of 
topsoil. 
</P>
<P>
 The river of sediment picked up speed during World War I, when farmers 
uprooted native vegetation on hillsides around Camarillo to make room for rows 
of lima beans, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accelerated erosion helped carve the barrancas and gullies that can be 
seen cutting into the hilly terrain today. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 1862, no defined channel connected the creek runoff with Mugu Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1889, residents had cleared a straight channel along a portion of Calleguas 
Creek. Over the years, the channel was lengthened and improved to minimize 
flooding and steer runoff directly into the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy dredged the lagoon in 1946, but neither the report nor Navy officials 
suggest doing that again. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the immediate disruption of wildlife, dredging could stir up 
DDT and other agricultural pesticides and pollutants that have poured into the 
lagoon over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a layer of DDT or heavy metals five feet down, you'd just mix it 
up in the water and expose endangered birds and species again," Schwartz said. 
"Right now, it is more or less entombed." 
</P>
<P>
 Without the option of dredging the lagoon, soil conservationists have focused 
on solutions upstream along the 36-mile-long Calleguas Creek, which has three 
different names. 
</P>
<P>
 It's called Arroyo Las Posas in its middle section and Arroyo Simi to the 
east, where it wends through Moorpark and Simi Valley. The creek's tributaries 
include Conejo Creek, Arroyo Santa Rosa, Beardsley Wash / Revolon Slough and 
dozens of streams throughout the watershed that is 30 miles long and 14 miles 
wide. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent decades, ranchers have cleared additional steeper, sloping land in 
the watershed to plant avocado orchards and citrus groves, particularly in the 
hills around Camarillo and Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 The denuded slopes and access roads have increased the runoff, as have 
increased housing and commercial developments. The increased velocity of the 
waters scours the gullies and barrancas as the runoff heads to the creek on its 
way to Mugu Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 In a moderate storm expected every two years on average, suburban development 
and farmland cultivation has increased runoff by about 20%. And with it comes a 
heavier load of sediment, which boosts the bulk of the flow and its erosive 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 To slow the trend, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, formerly the 
Soil Conservation Service, has been working with farmers and other landowners 
to plant cover crops on newly disturbed land. 
</P>
<P>
 It offers advice on building small structures in stream beds and planting 
vegetation to slow the flow of runoff in gullies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the report released earlier this month, soil conservationists also 
recommended that the county pursue plans to build a sediment catch basin as 
part of improving lower Calleguas Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Sheydayi, deputy director of public works, said the planed basin on 
Calleguas Creek near Pacific Coast Highway is an important part of rebuilding 
the channel to prevent a recurrence of flooding, such as the widespread 
inundation of prime farmland in March, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are optimistic we can pull something off in the next five years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also suggests giving the public better access to Mugu Lagoon, which 
can be visited now only with special permission from the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 Mugu Lagoon "has a real identity problem," said Peter Brand of the state 
Coastal Conservancy, which provided a $100,000 grant to help with the $256,000 
report. He suggests that it would have broader public support if it becomes 
better known. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said the base's environmental office is working on a plan to create a 
special gate so that the public can visit the wetlands without needing to 
penetrate the shield of tight naval security elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Protected wetlands and salt marsh make up 2,500 of the base's 4,490 acres, and 
much of the fragile area is separated from the buildings reserved for missile 
tests and other secret work. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some peaceful spots out here," Schwartz said, scanning the wetlands 
from the old boat dock. "You'd never know you were on a Navy base, until an 
F-14 screeches by."

BIRTHRATES VARY WIDELY IN COUNTY, STUDY SHOWS; HEALTH: OXNARD'S IS THREE TIMES 
THAT OF THOUSAND OAKS. RESULTS WILL HELP DECIDE FUNDING FOR PRENATAL, EARLY 
CHILDHOOD AND PARENTING PROGRAMS.

<P>
 Birthrates vary dramatically across Ventura County's 10 cities, with Oxnard's 
soaring three times as high as that of Thousand Oaks, a new study shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of live births for every 1,000 residents ranges from a low of 8.2 
in Thousand Oaks to a high of 25.9 in Oxnard, according to a recent report 
released by the Ventura County Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 That report -- the first comprehensive look at birth and fertility rates 
across the county -- was presented to the Board of Supervisors last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings will help public health officials determine how tax dollars can 
best be spent and bolster requests for more money to pay for prenatal, early 
childhood and parenting programs in areas with high birthrates, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prenatal care is very important in reducing the cost" of caring for unhealthy 
babies, said Dr. Elizabeth A. Trebow, of the county's public health department. 
"The earlier and more frequent prenatal care the better." 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Maggie Kildee said before Tuesday's meeting that the 
statistical analysis, titled the 1994 Health Status Report for Ventura County, 
will help county officials seek state and federal funds related to maternal and 
infant health. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's any local dollars to increase (prenatal) programs," 
Kildee said. "But we can certainly go after grants or any kind of federal or 
state help available." 
</P>
<P>
 The report was prepared by a newly formed research office in the county's 
public health department. It is the first part of a county health report card 
that will be issued each year, said Phillipp K. Wessels, director of the Health 
Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Two more sections of this year's health status report will be released in 
coming months, Wessels said. The second section will look at mortality in 
Ventura County, including the 10 leading causes of death as compared to the 
state and nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The third section will focus on pediatric and preventable injuries, he said. 
Information contained in the reports will be used to drive private and public 
policy decisions regarding health care in Ventura County, Wessels said in a 
letter to supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial report focuses on birth and fertility rates across Ventura County 
in 1990, when the last U. S. census was taken. The east county cities of 
Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley had the lowest births per 1,000 residents, with 
8.2 and 10.2, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Fertility rates, which measure births per 1,000 females 15 to 44 years old, 
were also lowest in Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley. Thousand Oaks' fertility 
rate was 34.2, while Simi Valley's was moderately higher at 39.2. 
</P>
<P>
 Those rates more than doubled in the west county cities of Oxnard, Santa Paula 
and Fillmore. Births per 1,000 women of childbearing age there were 109, 117.1 
and 117.3, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 When broken down by ethnic group, the study found that Latino women in Ventura 
County had a fertility rate more than twice that of white, Asian or Native 
American women. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethnicity was emphasized in the study so that health officials can define 
needy populations and offer medical care that is culturally sensitive, the 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers affirm earlier census data showing that the proportion of Latinos 
in Ventura County is growing faster than any other ethnic group. Cities with 
Latino majorities in the 1990 census -- Fillmore, Santa Paula and Oxnard -- are 
also the communities with the highest fertility rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also analyzed infant mortality rates in Ventura County compared to 
the statewide average. Demographers consider infant mortality a good indication 
of a region's overall health, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the years 1990 through 1992, Ventura County's infant mortality rate was 
5.6 per 1,000 live births, compared to the California average of eight per 
1,000 live births. In 1993, the county infant mortality rate dropped to 5.5, 
while California's dropped to 6.8 per 1,000 births. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County also had a lower number of births to young mothers compared to 
the state. During the years 1990 to 1992, 3.9% of births were to mothers 10 to 
17. By contrast, the state average was 4.5% for the same period.

 Figures for Ventura County's cities are based on births per 1,000 of 
population. Thousand Oaks: 8.2 Simi Valley: 10.2 Camarillo: 13.5 Ventura: 17.7

STREET SMART: VIEWS OF MOTORISTS, RESIDENTS DIVERGE ON PARKING SPOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I have a complaint about a parking problem that creates a bottleneck on a 
major thoroughfare in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem arises when attempting to turn right onto Seaward Avenue from 
westbound Ocean Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time, there are cars parked on Ocean near the corner. Even if 
there are only a couple of motorists waiting at the long light to go straight 
or turn left, it is impossible for anyone behind them who wants to turn right 
to squeeze past. 
</P>
<P>
 This means that everybody has to wait for the light, which makes Ocean very 
crowded. Sometimes drivers have to wait through two lights to get through. 
</P>
<P>
 A simple solution would be to prohibit parking near the corner on Ocean. 
Residents could park on Ocean on the other side of Seaward. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Watnick, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The solution to the bottleneck problem is not as simple as it seems. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents living on Seaward are not allowed to park on that major street, so 
they rely on parking along Ocean, Ventura Traffic Engineer Nazir Lalani says. 
</P>
<P>
 When complaints have been lodged about the bottleneck on Ocean, the city has 
sought to prohibit parking near the corner, but Seaward residents have 
complained that doing so would make it too difficult for them to park. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem would not be solved by prohibiting parking on just one side of the 
intersection because the bottleneck occurs on Ocean on both sides of Seaward, 
Lalani says. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Lalani says he will once again investigate the matter to see if a 
compromise can be worked out. 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I am writing with the hope of getting some help. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a mother of four children, two of whom attend Emilie Ritchen Elementary 
School on Cabrillo Way in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 I am concerned about speeding in the neighborhood and the safety of my 
children as they cross Cabrillo to get to school. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no stop signs on Cabrillo in this area, and cars fly by. 
</P>
<P>
 We definitely need something to control the traffic speeds. 
</P>
<P>
 It's sad to say, but so often these things are not taken care of until someone 
is seriously injured or killed. 
</P>
<P>
 All of my surrounding neighbors feel the same as I do. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Sandoval, Oxnard 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Stop signs are not going to solve the problem of fast-driving cars in your 
neighborhood, Oxnard Traffic Engineer Joe Genovese says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stop signs are used to control the right of way at an intersection, not the 
speed of traffic," Genovese said. "If you start trying to control speed that 
way, you're going to see a lot of accidents." 
</P>
<P>
 After studying the flow of traffic at Cabrillo at its intersection with 
Gallatin Place, Genovese says no additional traffic controls are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are still concerned for your children's safety, you may want to have 
them walk down the street to the nearest traffic signal, Genovese says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Genovese has forwarded a copy of your letter to the Oxnard 
Police Department's traffic enforcement division, which may have more impact on 
speeders than a stop sign. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I've noticed recently that there's a tripod stationed in the middle of the 
intersection of Madera Road and Los Angeles Avenue in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 If this thing is somehow supposed to regulate traffic, it seems strange to 
have it right in the middle of the intersection, where it could easily be 
knocked over. 
</P>
<P>
 What is the purpose of this device? 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Callahan, Simi Valley 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The device in question actually has nothing to do with measuring or 
controlling traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an electronic surveying instrument used to gauge distances between 
property lines, says Chic Dabbs, principal traffic engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Surveys are done occasionally by property owners who want to make sure that 
they know exactly where their property starts and their neighbor's property 
ends, Dabbs says. 
</P>
<P>
 The midpoints of intersections are ideal reference points because they are 
usually equidistant from the properties on either side, Dabbs says. 
</P>
<P>
 Surveying can take several hours or several days, depending on the complexity 
of the project, Dabbs says. The location of the equipment has not caused 
traffic safety problems in the past, he says.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: DRUNK-DRIVING ARRESTS DROP 40% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of drunk-driving arrests in Ventura County over the four-day 
holiday weekend dropped by more than 40% from a year ago, down to 19, the 
California Highway Patrol reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word in general is getting out that drunk driving is just not acceptable 
anymore," a CHP spokesman said. "A lot more people are adhering to that, and 
they're either not drinking or they're designating a driver." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the four-day holiday last year, the CHP reported 33 drunk-driving 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP conducted a maximum enforcement period from Wednesday night to Sunday 
night, assigning all available officers to the area's streets and highways.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NATIONAL FOREST; 2 ROADS TO CLOSE FOR WINTER SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To prevent road damage and ensure public safety, two roads in Los Padres 
National Forest will be closed for the winter, forest service officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pine Mountain Road, which intersects California 33 about 35 miles north of 
Ojai, was closed Nov. 23 and will remain closed until the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherry Creek Road, which connects with California 33 just south of the Pine 
Mountain Inn, is scheduled to close Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 That road may reopen between winter storms, however, depending on weather and 
soil conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing the roads has become a necessity, Ojai District Ranger Linda Riddle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a big snowstorm, we would sometimes have several hundred vehicles 
trying to travel up and down Pine Mountain Road," Riddle said. "Between the ice 
and rocks on the road, the traffic accidents and the confrontations between 
drivers, it was getting to be a real mess." 
</P>
<P>
 Both roads will remain accessible on foot. For information on Los Padres 
National Forest winter road closures, call the Ojai Ranger Station at 646-4348.

 For now, Orange County Ranger Ginny McVickar has the panoramic vistas and 
oak-filled canyons of Gen. Thomas F. Riley Wilderness Park largely to herself 
-- if you don't count the resident population of mule deer, coyotes, hawks and 
other wild creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 All that will change Dec. 10, when the 475-acre park opens its trail system to 
hikers, equestrians and mountain bikers. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of an opening day celebration, the park will offer free hay rides and 
guided tours. 
</P>
<P>
 The park, named after the retiring county supervisor, is at the east end of 
Oso Parkway, across from the Coto de Caza residential development near Mission 
Viejo.

 Today 
</P>
<P>
 The annual Holiday Craft Fair at Golden West College will begin in the student 
cafeteria. Hours of the boutique are 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raising event will feature holiday ornaments, jewelry, clothing, gift 
baskets and other handmade items. Some proceeds from the event will go to buy 
food and toys for needy families during the holidays.

GEORGE RAMOS: AFTER FACING FIRING SQUAD, HE'S NOT DAUNTED BY MUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood doesn't scare Alberto Pino -- not the druggies, not the 
streetwalkers, not the local street gangs and not the clogged traffic and dirt 
from the Metro Rail subway project. 
</P>
<P>
 He's not even fazed by the fact that his new restaurant on Cahuenga Boulevard 
is largely empty these days for lunch and dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an optimist and I'm going to make it in Hollywood," the determined Pino 
said the other day. "I will." 
</P>
<P>
 Struggling to make it in the tattered movie capital is nothing when you 
consider what Pino has already been through. Compared to facing a firing squad, 
the challenge of turning Rusty's Hacienda Mexican Restaurant into a success is 
no big thing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 50-year-old Pino encountered the firing squad in his native Cuba back in 
September of 1962 -- in the early days of Fidel Castro's regime. Pino and his 
two brothers, Armando and Aurelio, were rounded up for questioning by 
government officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Pino said his arrest came some days after Aurelio, a banker, was detained for 
suspected opposition to the government. One morning, Pino was brought before a 
firing squad, he said, with his back to a deep trench, to sign a statement of 
loyalty to the Communist government. 
</P>
<P>
 He was told to sign or be shot, but the defiant Pino, who was 18 at the time, 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the execution squad loaded blanks into their weapons and fired at 
him. He didn't flinch. And he didn't relent when he was told real bullets would 
be used. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't care," a friend recalled. "He's fearless." 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuffed by Pino, authorities tried the same tactic with Armando. They pointed 
to some blood in the trench, telling him it belonged to Pino. 
</P>
<P>
 The brother, however, didn't believe them and didn't sign either. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the three brothers, who were physically unharmed but separated 
during their detention, were released by Cuban authorities and they, with their 
families, left for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Pino eventually made his way to the San Francisco Bay Area, landing a job as a 
dishwasher for $1.19 an hour. He learned English, studied the restaurant 
business and worked his way up the ladder. He had managed several restaurants 
by the early 1970s, among them a pricey establishment at the Berkeley marina. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1975, he was the owner of a French restaurant in Lafayette. He moved to 
Southern California several years later, buying Rusty's Hacienda, a 
neighborhood eatery in the shadow of the Sears Roebuck store on Olympic 
Boulevard -- a longtime fixture in Boyle Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Pino opened a second Rusty's in North Hollywood, but the Eastside business -- 
with modest lunch traffic but roaring night-life receipts -- required his close 
attention. The city wanted the restaurant's location for a much-needed 
low-income housing project of 75 units. 
</P>
<P>
 Agreeing to be moved, Pino concluded, "The community needs this housing 
project." 
</P>
<P>
 He set out to find a new location, but few pleased him. Then, earlier this 
year, he heard of a vacant earthquake-damaged building in Hollywood that once 
housed Gorky's, a trendy restaurant and brewery that went out of business more 
than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He loved the place, but officials with the Community Redevelopment Agency, who 
were helping Pino find a new spot, shook their heads in disbelief. "You're 
crazy," they told him. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was serious, so much so that he poured in more than $200,000 of his own 
money to help renovate the 100,000-square-foot building in the 1700 block of 
Cahuenga. He also kept 18 of his Eastside employees on the payroll after the 
restaurant was closed in March, waiting for the day last week when the new 
Rusty's opened. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRA was impressed, too, and approved more than $525,000 to help with the 
relocation. 
</P>
<P>
 There were roadblocks along the way -- obtaining a liquor license, dealing 
with haughty local gangs and figuring out the menu -- but Pino was undaunted. 
He has been passing out free samples of salsa and chips to Hollywood merchants, 
offering two-for-one prices for meals and making contact with local Latino 
community groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not afraid of Hollywood or a few mocosos and what they might do," he 
said, using Spanish slang to describe troublemakers. "Maybe one day the mocosos 
will go to work for me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The other day, between greeting each new customer and hustling some banquet 
business, Pino admitted he still thinks about Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 "When things change there, I may go for a visit," he said. "But this is my 
country now. And I have a lot of work to do . . . here in Hollywood."

<P>
 A 39-year-old Santa Paula man is being held at Ventura County Jail on 
suspicion of recklessly discharging a firearm after two men were wounded at a 
weekend party, Santa Paula police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Pablo Navarette Acevedo at a house in the 100 block of Santa 
Ana Street about 8:15 p.m. Saturday after responding to a report of fighting 
and shots being fired at the residence, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two unidentified men were injured in the shooting, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that Acevedo started firing a gun during a fight at the 
party Saturday night, striking one man in the leg. Another man suffered a hand 
injury while attempting to disarm the suspect, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The condition of the men was not available Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Acevedo is being held on charges of discharging a firearm with gross 
negligence and willfully resisting arrest, a jail commander said Sunday. He is 
being held in lieu of $50,000 bail and is scheduled to be arraigned in Ventura 
County Municipal Court on Tuesday. JEFF McDONALD

<P>
 Five months after they were closed for renovations, three of the four 
interchange ramps on the Santa Paula Freeway at Kimball Road have reopened, 
Ventura city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ramps were closed in June as part of a $10-million program to widen and 
make Kimball Road safer. 
</P>
<P>
 Both westbound on- and off-ramps, along with the eastbound off-ramp, are open, 
and the eastbound on-ramp is scheduled to open next week, Ventura Traffic 
Engineer Nazir Lalani said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a bicycle and pedestrian underpass similar to the one at Victoria 
Avenue has been completed, Lalani said. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on the Kimball widening project began in August, 1993, and will 
be completed by the end of the year, city officials said. CHRISTINA LIMA

<TEXT>
<P>
 American-born Lucy and her new Ethiopian husband, Eskinder, have been invited 
to a celebration dinner given by Ethiopian friends of the groom living in the 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy is well-acquainted with Ethiopian foods.She knows how to eat with her 
fingers and use the bread, injeri, to pick up the food. However, she is 
unprepared when Isaac, the host she has just met, tears off a piece of bread, 
scoops up some stew, tastes it, then comes over and thrusts some into her 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 She is offended to have a stranger put his fingers in her mouth.  
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 The host sampled the fare before offering it to his guests for the same reason 
royalty employs official tasters: to confirm that the food was safe and 
delicious. 
</P>
<P>
 When Isaac fed Lucy and the others their first bite, he was also acting out a 
proverb shared by both cultures. "Don't bite the hand that feeds you," meaning 
if you supply your guests with nourishment, they are less likely to become 
enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 Rule: There is more to food than just do's and don'ts about diet. Certain 
forms of etiquette make a statement about cultural values such as generosity, 
safety and comfort.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: CONVERSATION WITH 
SANDRA G. BACA; 'THESE MEN COME FROM SUCH VIOLENT ENVIRONMENTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ten men sit in a semicircle in a small room decorated with Southwest Indian 
prints. They could be watching a football game. But they are in a group therapy 
session with psychologist SANDRA G. BACA at the Mid-Wilshire offices of the 
Center for the Prevention of Domestic Violence, which Baca founded in 1988. 
It's one of about 90 such centers where men charged with spousal battery in the 
Los Angeles area must go for up to a year's worth of weekly counseling 
sessions. Baca, 54, draws the men into discussion with a mix of animated humor 
and toughness. She was interviewed by KAY MILLS, author of This Little Light of 
Mine: The Life of Fannie Lou Hamer, (Plume, 1994).

 Question: What is the men's most frequent explanation for what they've done?

 Answer: The standard one is, "She provoked me. She wouldn't shut up. She got 
into my face and dared me to hit her. If she had stopped nagging, I wouldn't 
have done it." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are you trying to get the men to understand? A: Getting across the 
definition of physical abuse: It's pushing, kicking, shoving, biting, pulling 
her hair, grabbing her, throwing things, threatening her, pulling a gun on her, 
strangling her, trying to run her over, driving recklessly. It's common to hear 
them say, "I didn't hit her. All I did is push her," but by definition that is 
a violent act in the state of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You say that 80% of abuse in the home is emotional. Does this constitute 
swearing at somebody, belittling them?  
</P>
<P>
 A: That would be verbal abuse, the name calling. That's where you "thing-ify" 
her, call her the "four favorites," all denigrating words, the mildest being 
"whore." That opens the doors to the physical abuse. After you've thing-ified 
her, it's easy to hit her because you are convinced that she is a piece of 
garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 One man said the other day, "I told my wife that she just wasn't the same 
anymore, sexually, after she had two kids." She got very, very hurt and he 
couldn't understand why. Sometimes we'll role-play. We'll ask them, "Tell us 
what you did to her -- use the same tone of voice, use the same kind of 
gestures -- and then let's turn it around and have somebody do it to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the worst reaction you've ever encountered?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I have never been physically harmed by anybody (here), but I have been 
emotionally battered. One will act as a lightning rod and the whole group will 
turn on me: "You're full of it. You're a man-hater." They question my 
character, they question my sexuality, they question my competence. They will 
do an emotional job on me. 
</P>
<P>
 When I disagree with them, they start getting frustrated -- that's what they 
do best. And I will say to them, "Is that how you do your wife?" 
</P>
<P>
 They have not learned to use words as a negotiation skill. A lot of these men 
come from such violent environments that their behavior is not disturbing to 
them at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I know this is a tricky area, but do you find any cultural differences 
between the men who come here?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There are some cultural differences. Black Americans are much more 
accepting of the blending of the roles. They also are much more into the 
extended family and believe in the concept of community parenting and community 
disciplining. Black men are very tolerant of having their woman go and work. 
Historically, that's always happened. In the men I have seen, there is not that 
much demand for services, (such as) "She's got to have my food ready when I get 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of Latino men are here because they hit their woman because she did not 
have dinner ready when they came home. With Latinos, we come from a culture 
where the woman's role is taking care of the children. When it comes to 
everything else, the man does it. We see a change in this country when they 
come here; the woman is much more easily able to pick up the language and will 
find a job, even if it's working as a housekeeper, whereas for Latino men it's 
much harder. If their identity has been that of the bread-winner and they're 
not bringing in the money, there's going to be a lot of hard feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about Anglo men?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We don't have many in this office. I think it's because of where we're 
located. We have some Russians. Their attitude is, "How come women can do all 
this stuff?" 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did you get into this work?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I was in an abusive marriage. Because I had to learn to identify to survive 
with an abuser, I can identify how they were thinking, where they were coming 
from. I come across as a very strong and independent woman. I haven't always 
been this way. There was a time that I was very dependent on this man. I had 
four children by the time I was 21. Nobody seemed to think that what he was 
doing to me was a problem, so I convinced myself that it wasn't a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 If I allowed myself, I could sit down and have a pity party. I am trying to 
use my energy to help women, to understand violence and how we do it. What Her 
Clients Say 
</P>
<P>
 'It took a lot of tension out of me. I rarely lose my temper anymore. I take 
time-outs, work the program in my mind.' -- Charlie 
</P>
<P>
 'I think I've already learned my lesson. . . . I don't think it's fair that 
everyone has to come to 52 sessions.' -- Anthony 
</P>
<P>
 'I didn't believe in this program when I first came. Now I have realized there 
is a lot of violence in each of us.' -- Manuel 
</P>
<P>
 'The best thing is that I understand how to not let someone provoke me into a 
situation where I'm the loser'. -- Murvin 
</P>
<P>
 'I thought it was going to be more structured. It's more about having people 
examine you, you examine them, and talk it out.' -- Jason

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: COMMUNITY ESSAY; 
'LANGUAGE KEEPS RACISM ALIVE'; DICTIONARIES AIM TO CLARIFY WORDS. BUT SOME 
SEEMINGLY ORDINARY DEFINITIONS MAY FOSTER UNCONSCIOUS RACIAL BIAS.

studies at California State University, Dominguez Hills.

<TEXT>
<P>
 While sitting at the computer, having finished the task at hand, I decided to 
explore the word-processing program. I started looking up words and stumbled on 
ethnic . 
</P>
<P>
 I had learned this word years ago, but had eliminated it from my vocabulary, 
though I had kind of forgotten why. The reason became apparent when the meaning 
came up on the screen as "heathen," an uncivilized, unreligious person. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the justification for enslaving Africans was that church authorities 
labeled them heathens. When Europeans began exploring, they discovered other 
people in the world, all of whom were people of color. European scholars did 
not equate these people as being equal to them, so they labeled them "ethnics." 
 
</P>
<P>
 This is still a common practice. This same terminology is used in today's 
major universities: ethnology, ethno-history, ethnomusicology, ethnic arts. 
Next I typed in black . To my amazement, I discovered it defined as 
"forbidding, menacing, threatening, evil, wicked" and more. This could explain 
why many people may have negative attitudes toward black people. 
</P>
<P>
 Thumbing through the Dictionary of Word Origins, I looked up negro , a term 
formerly used for African Americans. To my surprise, the book said "see 
denigrate, " which was defined as "to physically turn something black." This 
myth, which claims black people are cursed, was erroneously thought to come 
from the Bible and was the main rationale for the enslavement of African 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 My exploration then prompted me to call up white , which was defined as 
"morally and spiritually pure, innocent, harmless, free from evil, Caucasian," 
and, according to Webster's New World Dictionary and Collegiate versions, "a 
member of an ultraconservative or reactionary political group." 
</P>
<P>
 Several folks might get a laugh out of those definitions. But when the 
laughing stops and reality sets in, one has to consider the futility of this 
kind of terminology. 
</P>
<P>
 If white people are taught this kind of vocabulary from cradle to grave, how 
can they fail to develop a false sense of superiority? Generation upon 
generation will pass this mistaken assumption on to the point where it becomes 
second nature. Similarly, when African Americans are taught the same 
vocabulary, a sense of inferiority, hopelessness, and "to hell with society, I 
am going to be as destructive as possible" can set in. Couple that with being 
taught that black people have done nothing of worth, and that blacks are 
nothing, and you have set up a very volatile future. 
</P>
<P>
 Racism is a mental illness. Many of us fall victim to it because the language 
we use keeps it alive, in many instances, unconsciously. The challenge we face 
is to make a conscious effort not to allow rotten language and concepts to be 
part of our behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Words hurt, especially when they perpetuate negative attitudes toward a group 
of people because of the color of their skin. The excuse "I didn't know that," 
no longer holds up. When unsure of a particular word, we can do what our 
parents and teachers told us and look it up in the dictionary. But we must also 
keep in mind that even the dictionary can subscribe to the tenets of racism. 
Our scrutiny must be constant.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: YOUTH OPINION; WHO 
ARE IMMIGRANTS?; STUDENTS LOOK TO FAMILIES, THEIR NEIGHBORS, THEMSELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When teacher Naomi Roth asked her eighth-grade students at Palms Gifted Magnet 
Middle School to interview an immigrant and write a report about it they 
"hemmed and hawed and said they couldn't find any." But few actually had to 
look further than their own families, friends or their bathroom mirror to 
locate one -- no surprise in a city where more than one in three residents is 
foreign-born. After they completed their assignments Roth compiled the essays 
into a booklet the students titled "Coming to America: Oral History of 
Immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Voices gave disposable cameras to six of the students and asked them to 
photograph their interview subjects. Freelance photographer and photography 
teacher Theodora Litsios met with the students to give them some photography 
pointers. Here are the photos with excerpts from their essays: "He Thought 
America Was Amazing" by Christina Lu 
</P>
<P>
 In Vietnam, at the age of 9, my father, Xuong A. Lu, sold paper boats and 
animals to help the family. There were a lot of hungry mouths. My father was 
the fourth son out of a family of 7 boys and 3 girls. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973 my father was drafted. When he came back he brought stories of endless 
fightng, like watching his friends being bombed to death. Many men left for the 
war, but few came back. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981 my father, mother, and my two oldest sisters and I boarded the plane 
to San Francisco. My father thought America was amazing. There weren't any 
skyscrapers in Saigon or subways or El trains. The people were unfamiliar to my 
father. Worrying that he would meet the wrong people or say the wrong things 
throbbed in his head, making him very self-conscious. 
</P>
<P>
 Our religion was one thing the Americans were concerned about. Being a 
Buddhist was hard. They thought our religion was something bad.  
</P>
<P>
 My father said one night to my mother, "If you want something there will 
always have to be sacrifices. But never sacrifice your religion and always 
remember to be proud of who you are...yellow or white it doesn't matter." 
"There is More Freedom Here" by Steven Phillips 
</P>
<P>
 Adina Grodsky was born in 1950 about two miles from Haifa, Israel. Adina's 
parents were divorced and she lived with her father in Israel while her mother 
lived in the USA.  
</P>
<P>
 During the Six-Day War, when Adina was 16, her kibbutz was bombed. Though 
bombs were falling and people were pounding on her door, she insisted on 
finishing her shower. Another time, when most of the children were gathering 
potatoes, they saw planes which dropped bombs on them. Before they could reach 
their shelters, one child was killed by a bomb and another by gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, her father allowed her to come to the USA. She decided to stay 
because there is more freedom here. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of a non-observant Jewish family, this project has made me 
appreciate this part of my heritage. I am proud of my Jewish ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 * "I Know Where I'm From" by Natalia Tucker 
</P>
<P>
 I listen to my classmates talk with disdain and disgust about others not born 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 them talk with disdain and disgust about others not born here. Telling them 
that they aren't wanted or needed. 
</P>
<P>
 What I consider an immigrant is different than the views of others. If a 
person or their ancestors moved from one country to another they are 
immigrants. No matter how far back in time they moved to this or any other 
country. The only race or group of people who aren't immigrants of the U.S. are 
the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't come here because of war or a civil dispute. I came here because my 
mom wanted a better life and education for me. I am a Jamaican native. I 
stepped off the plane on Jan. 14, 1985. I know the date because it was my 
birthday and I was 5. At no time have I ever considered myself an American. I 
never will. I know where I'm from. 
</P>
<P>
 * "My Father Was an Immigrant" by Fabienne Leys 
</P>
<P>
 My very own father was an immigrant, from Haiti. Here is the conversation we 
had:  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why did you leave the land you were born in? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I left when I was 17 because of the dictatorship government. Papa Doc 
(Francios Duvalier) was in power. It was 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did you leave? Did you come directly to the U.S. or did you go 
elsewhere first? Why did you choose the U.S.?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Whoa, slow down! OK, I came here by plane. And, yes, I did go elsewhere. I 
moved to Montreal to live with family, but I hated the weather greatly, so I 
tried New York. Then I decided to visit my older brother out here in sunny L.A. 
That was 1967.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Was your idea of the U.S. the same as reality? Were you disappointed or 
pleased? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I had never fallen for the "streets are paved with gold" bit. Sure, it's 
not as good as it used to be, but neither is Haiti. My idea was, "If I don't 
like it, I don't have to stay." And I'm still here, aren't I? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has your plan for life in America worked out? Have you faced 
discrimination? 
</P>
<P>
 A: My plan has definitely worked out. I have a good job, a beautiful family 
and my relatives live five minutes away. Of course I have faced discrimination, 
but doesn't everybody get bitten at least once by the bigotry bug? 
</P>
<P>
 * "Their Flight Was Canceled Due to the Revolt" by Emily Clark 
</P>
<P>
 My mother met Cynthia Tugnao (while waiting) at the bus stop one day when my 
bus was an hour late. Once Cynthia and I got to talking I found out that her 
thick accent wasn't from nowhere. Cynthia was born and raised in the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 She met her husband and had her three children there. Her husband had to 
travel often to the U.S. for business and they decided that it was pointless to 
spend so much money on airfare when they could move to America. 
</P>
<P>
 So they did -- or attempted to. But there was a revolution going on. Cynthia 
said they called it 'People's Power.' People revolting against a corrupt 
president, Ferdinand Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
 Their flight was cancelled due to the revolt. They finally did leave in late 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 She said, "At first I missed home. No one seemed to care about each other and 
it was very hard for my childern. But after we made friends and I got a job and 
our children into good schools, things seemed to work out. Part of the missing 
went away and now I can't imagine living there again." 
</P>
<P>
 * "In America You are Measured by What You Do" by Elanor Boyd 
</P>
<P>
 My father, Anthony W. Boyd was born in England in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 When I asked my dad to compare America and England, he said: In his homeland 
people take great pleasure in discussing things. If they can go to plays, read 
and talk about good books and drink good wine then, regardless of how they are 
doing economically, they feel they have a way of life that is the envy of every 
other country. In America, the standard of living is measured by what you do 
and what you have achieved.  
</P>
<P>
 I don't think the immigrants should be made our scapegoats and be shut out 
from our country. Someone might say, "Well your father is different, he's from 
England. It's the Mexicans that are screwing us up." But it's not different. 
It's exactly the same thing. All immigrants want is to make a better life for 
themselves, their families and to be given a chance.

VALLEY CHRONICLE: ICE SKATING RINK REOPENS BUT GLIDES ALONG IN OBSCURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's business as usual at the Ice Chalet in Laurel Plaza, except that the rest 
of the mall resembles a ghost town and many former patrons don't know the rink 
is operating again. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Hollywood mall took a hit during the Jan. 17 earthquake from which 
it has never recovered. There is talk of plowing the whole thing under rather 
than trying to restore it to its former state. 
</P>
<P>
 But that didn't stop the chalet from reopening, unlike other longtime tenants. 
According to chalet manager Michael Robertson, the rink has been open for 
business for almost a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still offering open skating, and hockey and figure skating lessons, 
with special rates for groups and a full-service snack bar," he says 
enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
 But attendance is down from pre-quake days, and he's not sure it will come 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some skaters began training other places," Robertson says, "and a lot of 
people don't even know we are still here." The uncertainty about the future of 
the mall is not helping. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been like skating into the wind, the last few months. 
</P>
<P>
 The rink suffered minimal damage from the quake, but a new entrance had to be 
created, according to Robertson. "We are using the back entrance -- what was 
the service entrance -- on Oxnard (Street) now," he says. He adds that a canopy 
has been put over the doors so people can spot it more easily. He's hoping more 
skaters will beat a path to the new door. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the future of the mall, he says: "All we can do is hope the management 
people decide to let us stay here. The Ice Chalet has been in this location 
since 1986. This is the place Richard Dwyer trained for the Olympics. As a 
matter of fact, he's still training here. He's going out on tour soon." 
</P>
<P>
 When Robertson is asked if the chalet's future doesn't look like it's skating 
on thin ice, he says: "Well, I try not to think that way. I think this is a 
wholesome place that is good for the community, and if we can stay here, we 
will." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, over at the Universal CityWalk, it looks like clear sailing . . . 
er, skating. The annual ice rink, which will be open through the holidays, has 
been set up next to the Universal City Cinemas, and skaters are now gliding 
over the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 What bills itself as Southern California's only outdoor skating rink can 
accommodate up to 150 skaters this year, says manager Brian Klavano, who adds 
that skate rentals and skating lessons are offered as well. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also an observation deck for people who are watchers, not doers, 
those who have too much respect for the welfare of their person to put their 
ankles through this kind of unaccustomed grief. 
</P>
<P>
 Klavano says this year the rink is 50 by 80 feet, almost twice as big as last 
year, to make room for the expected crowds. "We get every level of expertise 
here from the first-time skater to Olympian Tiffany Chin. The idea is just to 
get out in the fresh air and have some fun," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 While Klavano doesn't have to worry about anything as drastic as having his 
venue plowed out from under him, he does have to think about the weatherman. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain dampens even the most resolute outdoor skater's resolution. Too much 
sunshine and the ice is like something left over from a Tequila Sunrise, he 
says. Telling Stories in and Out of School 
</P>
<P>
 Acting coach Howard Schwartz has something to offer patrons of the Calabasas 
Farmers Market: a parking lot for kids instead of cars. 
</P>
<P>
 It's for parents, frustrated by children who want to know if it's time to go 
home yet. Schwartz has a corner of the market to tell the kids stories, while 
their parents prod the produce to their heart's content. 
</P>
<P>
 He's also volunteered his service in several Calabasas schools like Bay Laurel 
and Meadow Oaks in their creative storytelling endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
 He says it's his way of getting known and saying thank you to the community at 
the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz, who lives in Sherman Oaks, says Calabasas has been good to him. He 
opened an acting school about 1 1/2 years ago in the little arts center on Old 
Topanga Boulevard near Calabasas High School. He had 12 students then. Now, he 
says he has 150.  
</P>
<P>
 His community enthusiasm doesn't stop at creative storytelling and school 
visits. He says he's organizing the first Calabasas Community Cabaret to be 
held Dec. 16 and 17 at 8 p.m. at Calabasas High School. 
</P>
<P>
 He says all proceeds will benefit the arts enrichment programs of local 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz says he held open auditions for the show, but not all that many 
people showed up for them. "I had to go out and round up some talent," he says. 
"Some professional talent didn't feel they could donate their time," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 He did make one sensational find, he says: an 80-year-old comedienne. He 
encouraged an interview with her, but that will have to wait for another time. 
</P>
<P>
 When called, she was unavailable. Schwartz says she was probably out driving 
around in her tank. Lack of Blood Not Funny to Red Cross 
</P>
<P>
 This is not something you'd want to do after, say, seeing "Interview With the 
Vampire," but anyone looking for a good deed to do over the holiday season 
might check into the nearest Red Cross center and give blood. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Rick Bauer, director of donor recruitment for the Red Cross 
district that covers Los Angeles and Orange counties, it's no joke that blood 
supplies are dangerously low. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hospitals expect us to be able to meet their needs for blood, and we are 
getting to the point where we are not always certain that we will be able to 
meet them," Bauer says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could come to the point when patient care is affected and procedures will 
have to be postponed." 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer says the supply nationwide is down 10% from what it was last year. 
"Usually we have a good supply going into the holidays, which carries us over 
to the first of the year when people are not so busy with other things to think 
about giving blood. This year it just didn't happen that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer says he was heartened, though, by the response of people to the unusual 
open houses for donors at Red Cross centers on Thanksgiving. "We tried to let 
people know about the situation and how dangerous it is, and they responded 
well," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hoped to get about 250 pints on Thanksgiving Day from collection points in 
Los Angeles and Orange counties. We collected 457 pints of blood," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer says that includes the 141 pints collected on Thanksgiving at Red Cross 
centers in Van Nuys, Burbank and Valencia. What made it so impressive to him, 
he says, was that these were all individuals who walked in to donate. There 
were no corporate blood drives in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer says he knows that if people realize how low the supply is that 
donations will pick up. In the meantime, he says he's thankful for all those 
who visited centers Thanksgiving Day. Overheard: 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother is Catholic and my father is Jewish, so I really make out during 
the holidays from both sides of my family. The only thing I guess I don't have 
covered is Buddha's birthday. Do you get presents for that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven-year-old in his Studio City home to a visitor, who wondered whatever 
happened to the days when Christmas presents meant a sweater and a book.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TODAY'S TOPIC; CAN 
DOMESTIC BATTERERS BE "CURED" BY THERAPY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The domestic violence statistics in the United States today are staggering: 
Almost 4 million women a year are physically abused by their husbands or 
boyfriends. ; The American Medical Assn. puts the cost at between $5 billion 
and $10 billion for health care, lost productivity and criminal justice 
intervention.  
</P>
<P>
 Ending the violence is a seemingly insurmountable task, with most efforts 
focusing on getting the woman away from the abusive man.Some experts, however, 
advocate treating the abuser. Psychologist Sandra G. Baca speaks in today's 
Conversation about her work, which requires faith that batterers can reform 
themselves. Others are less sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We historically have not put a lot of faith in the rehabilitation of 
batterers as a means of helping the victim resolve the battering or abuse in a 
relationship," says Leah Aldridge, project director for the Teen Abuse 
Prevention Program for the L.A. Commission on Assault Against Women. "There are 
programs that are successful but (success) is entirely up to the behavior of 
the individual and the individual's willingness to change." 
</P>
<P>
 Assessing the success rate of rehabilitation programs is another challenge. 
"Most of the studies had gigantic dropout rates of up to 75%," says Ola 
Barnett, a professor of psychology at Pepperdine University. "Those that stayed 
had quite a bit of success in getting the actual physical violence to abate." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnett believes court-ordered treatment, as Baca provides, is most effective: 
"Court-mandated therapy sends a message that this will not be tolerated by the 
community. But when you look over the panorama of psychological problems, not 
all are amenable to treatment."

STUDY ON HELMET LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The UCLA study that claims that "the helmet law saved lives" (Nov. 16) has 
flaws in it. Looking at the accompanying graph, we see that the death rate had 
been going down for the two years prior to the helmet law. UCLA chose to assume 
that without helmet laws, the death rate would not have declined as much. This 
decline can be attributed to two factors: decreasing motorcycle ridership and 
the state motorcycle education program. These factors would have the same 
effect that they have had in prior years. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual death rate is still lower. The frequent el nino rains during the 
first few months of 1992 kept practically all motorcyclists off their bikes. In 
addition, some stopped riding because they felt that riding with a helmet was a 
nuisance. If these two factors are taken into account, we would expect the 
death rate to drop quite a bit in 1992. 
</P>

 Now that we have saved heads by putting helmets on motorcyclists, can they 
save our ears by putting mufflers on their tailpipes? Why can't the vroom vroom 
become air pollution history?

 That motorcycle helmets save lives there is no question. But does saving 
public money absolve the government's "the end justifies the means" intrusion 
on an individual's right to choose? If you accept this theory, then why not 
apply this reasoning to something more financially significant. Such as AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be easy to do. Using the motorcycle helmet law, just substitute the 
words "condom" and "sex" for "helmet" and "motorcycle." Make sex without a 
condom against the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridiculous? Intrusive? Of course. But all we've done is change just two words 
in an already existing law. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, only a complete fool would ride a motorcycle without a helmet.

PAPER BALLOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am a new resident to Southern California, having moved here from New York in 
September, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 I am consistently amazed and delighted by the many forward looking 
advancements in this section of the country, not the least of which is the 
traffic control systems, road repair work, etc.It seems they start and finish 
many items in one day. And even the recent earthquake did not deter them from 
repair and reconstruction of the freeways. I applaud you greatly. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, will someone please enlighten me . How in this day and age do we still 
have paper ballots for major elections? I have been voting since 1947 in New 
York City. I have never used a paper ballot. I am sure they had election 
machines long before I started voting. 
</P>
<P>
 There must be a good reason.

THIRD STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am a lawyer and public defender in Los Angeles. Today, one of my clients 
(whom I'm sure was innocent) was convicted of a non-serious, nonviolent felony. 
My 30-year-old client, a very proud man, began to sob uncontrollably as the 
court clerk read the verdict.He cried not just because he was innocent, but 
because he knew that he will spend the rest of his life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 My client has two prior robbery convictions. This was his third strike. He now 
faces a sentence longer than that meted out to premeditated murderers. This is 
so even though he was employed full-time and supports a loving wife and four 
children (with one on the way). His children will now grow up fatherless, 
without the guiding hand of someone who clearly now knows the difference 
between right and wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 He has redeemed himself. He is now much different than what he was in the 
early 1980s when he sustained his "strikes." However, to the mostly white, 
conservative electorate, he is a scourge. He is no longer human. He is referred 
to as "scum," "garbage," or "menace to society." 
</P>
<P>
 I know him. I know he is human. He is now a kind, caring person. But the 
three-strikes law doesn't factor such traits into its deadly equation. He will 
enjoy no freedom until his last breath.

CITIES DRAW A BEAD ON HANDGUNS; WELCOME MOVES IN L.A., INDIANAPOLIS, KANSAS 
CITY; A WISE VOTE IN STOCKTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As some congressional Republicans plan attacks on the tough new federal gun 
control laws, a few cities are showing signs of a welcome new resolve to curb 
firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 After a heated debate that generated national attention, the Stockton City 
Council last Monday rejected a measure that would have allowed any 
"law-abiding" city resident to carry a concealed pistol. The council agreed 
that the proposed ordinance would escalate street violence, not reduce it as 
supporters insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Stockton vote can only be seen as a victory in holding the line 
against today's reality, which is that society is awash in firearms. By 
contrast, Indianapolis and Kansas City, Mo., are using existing law to curb 
illegal gun possession. Their experimental efforts, while raising a host of 
questions, may offer lessons for other cities.  
</P>
<P>
 Police in those two cities now focus on guns the way they once did on drugs 
and drunk drivers. Concentrating on neighborhoods with a high incidence of gun 
violence, officers -- with the support of community groups -- stop cars for 
traffic violations such as an expired license plate or a broken headlight that 
permit them to lawfully peer inside for illegal firearms, which they have the 
authority to confiscate. Early results from this program, according to Kansas 
City officials, include a 50% drop in gun-related crimes in that area. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this approach worth a try here? A forthcoming U.S. Justice Department 
evaluation may provide some answers. In the meantime, the Los Angeles City 
Council seems to be on the brink of important changes. Last Monday the 
council's public safety committee approved a proposal to keep firearms dealers 
out of residential areas and require them to operate from fixed addresses. If 
adopted by the full council, the measure could aid law enforcement officials in 
stopping illegal sales. Several other worthy proposals, including plans to 
restrict the sale of ammunition, also are on the agenda.  
</P>
<P>
 Local action in California will be all the more important come January. With a 
Republican majority in the Assembly, local officials across the state can count 
on little help from the Legislature in addressing escalating gun violence.  
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Louis Caldera (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Assembly Select 
Committee on Gun Violence, tried hard last year to rescind the law that gives 
the state power to preempt local gun laws. He will try again this year, though 
the climate in Sacramento surely will be less hospitable. In addition to 
reviving his bill lifting state preemption, Caldera plans to introduce a 
measure, similar to one in Maryland, banning the manufacture and sale of cheap 
handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 No less necessary are proposals to require handgun trigger locks and locked 
storage of firearms. All these changes are more than warranted.

NEW HOPE FOR COURTROOM TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The federal appeals courts appear to be, wisely, rethinking a hasty decision 
made by the Judicial Conference of the United States to end a promising 
experiment with cameras in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 In September the conference, the policy-making body of the federal courts, 
voted not to renew a three-year pilot project in which civil trials and 
proceedings were televised.This despite favorable results from the experiment 
and the wide use of cameras in state court proceedings in California and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the chief judge of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, in 
Cincinnati, reportedly said that his counterparts in the 13 federal circuits 
generally agree that televising appeals court proceedings does not raise the 
same concerns as having TV cameras at trials. (Some judges worried that cameras 
in the courtroom could influence jurors or witnesses, who of course are not 
part of appeals proceedings.) 
</P>
<P>
 It has reportedly been proposed to the Judicial Conference's executive 
committee that appellate proceedings be televised. The executive committee, 
which is already on record as being in favor of expanded television coverage, 
is likely to make a favorable recommendation to the full Judicial Conference. 
If approved, cameras could be invited into every federal circuit court of 
appeals on a permanent basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Though appeals proceedings differ from trials, the televising of appeals could 
open the door to addressing some of the concerns about the effect of cameras in 
the courtroom. Thus the appeals court experiment with cameras, as well as the 
trial court experiment, should be pursued.

REPUBLICAN TAX CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let me see if I've got this straight. The newly anointed party of the middle 
class wants to cut the capital gains tax to spur growth and create jobs (Nov. 
11). They also enthusiastically support Alan Greenspan's recent interest rate 
hikes (Nov. 16) undertaken to dampen "excessive growth" and slow down job 
creation now that the economy has reached "full employment." 
</P>
<P>
 This makes so much sense that I suppose it is only coincidence that it gives a 
couple of great breaks to the wealthy elites who brought them their offices. 
Too bad that it dampens any prospect of a tax cut for the middle class whom 
they so enthusiastically claim to represent. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 It certainly appears that the leaders of the Republican victory are planning 
to pick up right where Reagan and Bush left off. Namely, tax breaks for the 
rich (those who have property to sell) and cuts in welfare (those who have 
their hand out with nothing to sell). And all the time talking about the 
balanced budget. Sounds like more Reaganomics (the rich man's savings will 
trickle down to those in need). It never worked and won't work now.  
</P>
<P>
 It would make more economic sense to tax those best able to pay and emphasize 
a program to put people to work who need a job. Cut spending by starting at the 
top -- government -- such as a freeze in employment, a 10% cut for all those 
making more than $75,000 per year, including the President, Vice-President, 
members of Congress, judges, etc., entitlements by those retired from 
government jobs, and cutting out nonessential government programs, including 
the costly space program and energy research. Turn these programs over to the 
Ford Foundation, or the Getty Foundation, or whoever else might fund them. Only 
then will we take the Republicans seriously that they will work toward a 
balanced budget and launch a sensible economic program for the future.

 The Republicans are in charge and like the bullies at school their first 
targets are going to be the weakest kids, the ones who are not liked and cannot 
defend themselves. While the GOP is busy throwing poorly educated, single 
mothers out on the street without their babies, business can rest comfortably 
knowing that their subsidy checks are still coming. We still have a spiraling 
business welfare-state, helped along by lobbyists and PACs and an ever eager 
Congress that needs reelection money, private jet rides and exotic vacations ( 
oh, excuse me, fact-finding missions). If the GOP is looking to reduce 
government and cut taxes, it should start with the subsidies and special 
considerations for big business before it takes nourishment and education from 
our children.

A GREAT DRAGON SURGES TOWARD MODERNITY; ACCELERATED CHANGE IS HAVING HUGE 
IMPACTS IN CHINA, BOTH GOOD AND BAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 China's march toward modernization continues at a dazzling pace. Five years 
ago a narrow two-lane road, crowded with horse carts and people, was the path 
out of the Beijing airport. Today there's a modern, multilane toll freeway. 
China's make-over goes on literally around the clock, with many thousands of 
construction workers fashioning new highways and perched atop bamboo scaffolds 
knocking down old buildings or putting up new ones. China is embracing 
Americana from old Shirley Temple movies to the Hard Rock Cafe. English is in, 
Russian is out. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet with China's rapid transformation to a "socialist market economy" come 
undercurrents of instability. Millions of people are on the move in search of 
better-paying jobs as market forces disrupt a system that guaranteed lifetime 
employment. Millions more are jobless. Inflation is running at more than 25%. 
Corruption is on the rise. There have been sporadic incidents of worker and 
peasant unrest. Children begging at the train station in Guangzhou and on the 
main street of Beijing reflect the unintended consequences of reform. 
</P>
<P>
 If Beijing succeeds in the incredibly complex task of managing a 
transformation, it could become a new model of economic development. Should it 
fail, the world's most populous nation could fall into chaos, with horrifying 
international implications. 
</P>
<P>
 With China in flux, the United States must keep Beijing engaged in a 
constructive and broad-based relationship. When President Clinton severed the 
link last May between human rights and renewal of China's most-favored-nation 
trade status, the move was controversial and unpopular but was correct for the 
long term: U.S.-China relations cannot be assessed through the narrow prism of 
human rights alone. The relationship must embrace issues that include security, 
the environment, trade, immigration and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Like it or not, the Chinese interpretation of human rights is to feed, clothe, 
house and employ its people. The numbers are daunting despite a 
one-child-per-family policy since 1979. A population of 1.2 billion in 1995 and 
of 1.3 billion by the end of the century is predicted. About 80 million Chinese 
subsist below the poverty line now. The well-being of the nation's citizenry is 
critical to stability. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Chinese enjoy greater personal freedom and mobility than in the 
past. They can seek jobs in new places (although they cannot permanently reside 
in a new city without permission). More than a quarter of a million Chinese are 
studying abroad, mostly in the United States. More households have TVs than 
refrigerators; foreign programming and news can be seen now, even though 
television remains state-controlled, as do newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, Beijing has managed most of the economic realignments through 
incremental changes. The central government has allowed the provinces to 
establish industrial zones and special economic development zones. Joint 
ventures with foreign companies have been encouraged. This has resulted in some 
odd combinations -- like a firm that produces the pricey designer clothes of 
Escada and builds power plants too. 
</P>
<P>
 Bigger, more disruptive changes may come as Beijing moves next year to remake 
inefficient state-owned enterprises, of which a third to a half are losing 
money. The government will also have to tackle bigger challenges, including 
creating a new monetary system and revamping its tax system. Conforming to 
international legal, financial and trading standards will be necessary in order 
to restore Shanghai as a major international financial and banking center. 
</P>
<P>
 China now is spreading across the Pacific. The state-owned Xinmin Evening News 
in Shanghai has a Los Angeles office and this month began distributing a U.S. 
edition via satellite. A Beijing restaurant that specializes in Peking duck 
opened an outlet in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 When senior leader Deng Xiaoping, the architect of economic reform, traveled 
to southern China to invigorate change in 1992, he reportedly said it was 
pointless to argue whether something was Western or Eastern. He said there is 
now a common world civilization of which China should be part. It most 
decidedly is.

CLARENCE THOMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I rise to the politically incorrect task of defending Supreme Court Justice 
Clarence Thomas. "Bookmark" (Opinion, Nov. 13) featured the Jane Mayer and Jill 
Abramson book, "Strange Justice," and highlighted their disappointment that 
Thomas fails to show that special empathy that a black man should bring to the 
high court.They cited Thomas' dissent in a case involving the beating by two 
guards, in front of their supervisor, of a shackled prisoner. Mayer and 
Abramson say that Thomas did not consider the beating to be cruel and unusual 
punishment and, therefore, was constitutional in Thomas' opinion.  
</P>
<P>
 Justice Thomas did not say that the prisoner beating was constitutional! 
Rather, Thomas considered the beating to be wholly improper and thought that 
the victim could have collected dollar damages, that administrative remedies 
were available and that the victim could have successfully argued denial of due 
process of law. Thomas' dissent did not accept the prisoner's interpretation of 
cruel and unusual punishment because, in Thomas' view, that clause is limited 
to the penalties imposed by the courts (not those imposed by misconduct by 
guards acting outside their authority). The court did not order the beating. 
Thus, the illegal beating was not society's punishment.  
</P>
<P>
 Mayer and Abramson are senior writers for the Wall Street Journal. They spent 
two years researching and writing the book. They should have learned to locate 
and read Supreme Court opinions, especially if they wanted to cite cases to 
carry the heavy burden of demonstrating that a justice of the Supreme Court has 
a nature that can be described as strange or even cruel.

INTERVIEW WITH THE ELECTORATE: A CHRONICLE; VAMPIRE POLITICS: IN THEIR SWING TO

 Perhaps not coincidentally, three days after the national election that turned 
Congress over to the Republican Party, Anne Rice's 1976 novel, "Interview With 
the Vampire," finally made it to the big screen. Starring Tom Cruise and Brad 
Pitt as monsters differentiated by their ability to identify with suffering 
human beings, the film, which has been both long desired and feared by Rice's 
fans, holds a mirror up to the current moment in American political 
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as every science-fiction film located on a distant planet ("Star Trek: 
Generations" is a current example) is necessarily about life on Earth -- so 
every monster film is a meditation on our feelings about humanity as a species. 
Because the monster is inhuman -- an alien, mutant, cyborg, zombie or bogyman 
-- its tendency to attack people defines a focus of the genre: How should we 
feel about human misery? 
</P>
<P>
 The power of Rice's vision, both in the novel and the film, derives from the 
way it broadens this standard horror-film theme by associating a range of 
attitudes with different vampires. Louis, the central figure in this first of 
Rice's "The Vampire Chronicles," agonizes over the pain that he and the other 
creatures of the night inflict on a parade of victims drawn into their circle 
of death; Lestat, who in this work is more bitter and cruel than he is in the 
sequels, argues for detachment and encourages Louis to laugh at the death 
agonies caused by their homicidal thirst. 
</P>
<P>
 As the American electorate has swung right in recent years, it has, arguably, 
embraced Lestat's position. The homeless appeared in force in American cities 
throughout the 1980s, but -- led by a President who insisted that it was 
"morning in America" -- it was easy for conservatives not to see them, not to 
feel their pain. Mocking Michael Dukakis during the 1988 presidential race, 
Reagan quipped, "You know, if I listened to him long enough, I would be 
convinced that people are homeless . . . going without food and medical 
attention, and that we've got to do something about the unemployed." And Reagan 
may well have felt the same way about AIDS sufferers, since during the early 
years of the epidemic he told jokes about them and underfunded both research 
and preventive education. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the '80s, the figure of the monster as an amused and amusing killer 
came to pervade popular culture -- Freddy Krueger, Hannibal Lecter and a 
reinvented Joker. The laughter that accompanies violence in the comic books and 
movies in which these characters appear is an extreme example of French 
philosopher Henri Bergson's notion that amusement requires a temporary 
anesthesia of the heart, a moment of detachment from the pain inflicted on the 
butts of cruel joking. The hostility that passes for wit on increasingly 
popular conservative radio talk shows suggests that more and more Americans are 
eager to fall under the numbing influence of this comic anesthesia. 
</P>
<P>
 If Lestat is a Republican, then Louis may be the last of the liberals, 
righteously holding onto a sentimental affiliation with the species he is 
leaving behind. Like Bill Clinton or Tom Foley or George Mitchell, he shares 
our pain. Of course, mere empathy, however noble, cannot solve problems. This 
is the weakness that was exposed and exploited in the last election: Do the 
social programs designed by Democrats and now bending beneath the Republican 
guillotine -- the welfare system, Medicaid, the Job Corps -- hurt or help the 
people they serve? 
</P>
<P>
 For years after he is turned into a vampire by Lestat, Louis -- in what can be 
seen as symbolizing the forgotten potential of liberal policies -- decides to 
make the vampire's ultimate sacrifice by surviving on the blood of animals to 
avoid taking human life. Perhaps Louis realizes that empathy can be efficacious 
only when it leads to action. Similarly, only an electorate willing to pay more 
to create a less divided society is going to move us toward social justice.  
</P>
<P>
 Just after the election, the audience I saw Rice's film with was clearly more 
drawn to Lestat than to Louis. The philosophic, moralistic doubt and anguish of 
the new vampire elicited bemusement and the odd groan. Each of Lestat's jokes 
-- teasing the girl he has just turned into a monster, dancing with the corpse 
of her mother, jumping on top of a coffin into which he has thrust a screaming, 
half-dead prostitute -- drew belly laughs. Like the reporter interviewing him, 
the audience seemed to miss the point of Louis's narrative, which is simply 
this: Once we stop caring about human pain, we are already dead.

DOUBLE DIPPING? NO, QUADRUPLE; ENTITLEMENTS: COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENTS NEED TO 
GO TO INDIVIDUALS, NOT TO EACH PENSION; A CAP WOULD SAVE BILLIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HASTINGS KEITH, Former Rep. Hastings Keith (R-Mass.) is co-chairman of the 
National Committee on Public Employee Pension Systems. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many in the two major political parties are talking out of both sides of their 
mouths about the role entitlement spending plays in the severity of the debt 
and deficit. A litmus test is needed to see who truly cares about ensuring the 
future fiscal health -- and stability -- of our nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The reform of federal pension cost-of-living adjustments should provide that 
litmus test. A COLA is an annual automatic raise in benefit that reflects 
increases in the consumer price index. 
</P>
<P>
 How can anyone -- Democrat or Republican -- claim to be fiscally responsible 
and yet use tax dollars and borrowings to give cost-of-living-adjustments 
which, for many, provide for the cost of living it up? 
</P>
<P>
 The National Committee on Public Employee Pension Systems believes that COLAs, 
at best, should only be granted on that amount -- and no more -- of federal 
pension income that goes to pay for food, clothing and reasonable shelter. 
Calculated in this fashion, COLAs would only support real increases in the cost 
of living. 
</P>
<P>
 I know whereof I speak: I am receiving four federal pensions 
(congressional/Civil Service, military reservist, Civil Service survivors and 
Social Security). I am entitled to these work-related pensions. I made 
contributions toward all but my military pension. But I should not get four 
cost-of-living adjustments. No one, including myself, ever paid in one cent, or 
worked one extra day to "earn" a COLA. On Jan. 1, the nation's 42 million 
Social Security recipients will receive a 2.8% COLA. As a 30-plus-year 
private-sector worker -- one who always paid the maximum Social Security tax -- 
the Social Security COLA entitlement will provide me $33 a month. For the 
average retired worker, the Social Security COLA will provide $18 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 But three months later, on April 1, 1995, in addition to my Social Security 
COLA, I will get a 2.8% COLA on each of my three other federal pensions. I will 
be getting 14.6 times more in COLAs than the average retired worker under 
Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand total of my monthly COLAs will be $263 -- and not because of any 
real increase in my cost of living, but because each of my four pensions is 
"entitled" to a full COLA. "Quadruple dipping" into four COLAs has already 
allowed me to collect more than $650,000 in COLAs. Without Congress bringing 
sanity to this madness, I will get $500,000 more in COLAs alone if I live out 
my actuarial life expectancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Our debt-ridden-but-spendthrift government hasn't figured out yet that it's 
the person, not the pension, that needs a COLA.  
</P>
<P>
 The COLA cap proposed by the National Committee on Public Employee Pension 
Systems would largely remedy this situation. It would give full COLAs on the 
combined federal-pension income (including Civil Service, military pensions and 
Social Security) that is equivalent to the maximum yearly Social Security 
benefit. In 1994, at age 65, this amount was $13,764 per year ($20,646 for a 
qualified couple).  
</P>
<P>
 The cap would save the nation more than $400 billion during the lives of the 
federal systems' present participants. It could, in the long run, cut the cost 
of the nation's federal-pension systems in half. If someone's combined total is 
less than the maximum Social Security benefit, the pensioner would continue to 
receive the full COLAs needed. The proposal doesn't cut pensions; it just 
limits future COLA raises. 
</P>
<P>
 Entitlement spending and interest payments together will exceed 70% of total 
federal outlays by 2003 (58% for entitlements and 14% for interest). The 
present course is unsustainable. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, in public hearings held by the Kerrey-Danforth Bipartisan 
Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform, one after another special-interest 
group lobbyist claimed that its members are not the cause of the entitlement 
problem. They maintain that they should be exempt from the sacrifice required 
for its solution. Now, both political parties are even suggesting that the 
budget can be balanced, and the debt reduced without touching entitlements. And 
politicians wonder why the public is cynical. 
</P>
<P>
 But only when the public puts enough heat on politicians about the severity of 
the debt and deficit will COLA and entitlement reform be possible.

TRAN HEAD OVER HEELS AS TITANS WIN, 1-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Tran might not have been in the game if Peter Lak hadn't been hurt, but 
Tran was the man of the moment in sudden-death overtime Sunday and Cal State 
Fullerton rolled into the quarterfinals of the NCAA soccer playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran, a junior reserve, executed an over-the-head scissor kick that Matt 
Bradbury headed into the goal, giving Fullerton a 1-0 victory over San 
Francisco in front of 2,651 in Titan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the kind of shot that you'd say you would give him a million bucks if 
he could do it again, and he never would," Dons Coach Stephen Negoesco said. 
"But it was a good goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Tran said it was all reaction. "It was just something that happened," he said 
with a big smile. "You get lucky sometimes, and in that case I got very lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Tran has played sparingly this season primarily because of injuries, and Coach 
Al Mistri said Lak probably would have stayed in the game had he not been 
re-injured early in the first of the three overtime periods. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran's kick surprised Bradbury as much as anyone. Bradbury said he had almost 
started running back on defense when he saw the kick come into the box. "It was 
an amazing play," Bradbury said. "I just finished it." 
</P>
<P>
 It was only the third goal the Dons (9-7-4) have allowed in eight games, but 
it left them stunned. "That goal is certainly one I'm going to see for a 
while," San Francisco goalkeeper Scott Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal left Fullerton (14-6-2) one victory away from a second consecutive 
appearance in college soccer's final four. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans will meet Indiana, a 1-0 winner over Creighton, in the 
quarterfinals next weekend. The site of that game will be determined Monday by 
the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
 As dramatic as Fullerton's winning goal was, the Titans almost were beaten 
earlier in sudden-death overtime when a shot by the Dons' Chris McDonald hit 
the crossbar and fell straight down. 
</P>
<P>
 The two coaches agreed that McDonald erred by trying to drive the ball into 
the net. "He should have just touched it, and if he had done that, it would 
have been a goal because their goalkeeper had come out," Negoesco said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri agreed: "Yeah, he cracked it, instead of pushing it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons, drained by the disqualification of two starters in last week's 
victory over Fresno State, played a conservative, defensive game throughout 
regulation play and mostly through the first two overtime periods. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton had 18 shots compared to nine for San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Joey Franchino threatened on a driving kick from 30 yards, but Thompson 
stabbed the ball with a dive to his left. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton also dominated the first overtime, four shots to none, but failed to 
score. The best opportunity was late in the period when Brad Wilson missed from 
just outside the box and Bradbury's rebound attempt was deflected.

RAMS AT HEIGHT OF IMPERFECTION; PRO FOOTBALL: IT'S THE SAME OLD STORY AS 
MISTAKES PROVE COSTLY IN 31-17 DEFEAT IN SAN DIEGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They know how to lose, how to get the lead then blow it, how to throw a scare 
into the opposition before faltering, how to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 They could be 8-4, but for a play here and there, they claim, but they are 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are losers again for a fifth consecutive season. The San Diego 
Chargers' 31-17 come-from-behind victory Sunday at Jack Murphy Stadium before 
59,579 assured the Rams (4-8) of finishing no better than .500. 
</P>
<P>
 "Loser's delight," Ram cornerback Darryl Henley said. "You know what that 
means? It means when you have been losing so long, you become surprised to find 
yourself winning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sorry for Chuck Knox. It's not that we are unprepared. How can you be 
ahead, 14-6, at halftime and then come out and be completely ineffective? It's 
not the coaching, it's not the scheme, it's not who ran it or who should have 
thrown it. It's the people in this locker room; the guys on this team just 
aren't doing it. It's an attitude; someone forgot to tell us it's not OK to 
lose week in and week out. I'm telling you, we don't know how to win games." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams wasted a halftime advantage for the third time this season, absorbed 
their sixth defeat in the last eight games and helped push the Chargers (9-3) 
within two victories of clinching the AFC West Division title. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same thing that's been happening all year," said Ram defensive end 
Fred Stokes. "It reminds me of my basketball team my sophomore year in high 
school. If the game had ended at halftime we would have been 15-0. We look back 
at our record now, and we just can't hold on." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams took a 14-6 halftime lead, and the hometown fans were booing the 
stumbling Chargers after wide receiver Tony Martin dropped two potential 
touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
 But after taking the second-half kickoff, the Rams were forced to punt. 
Charger cornerback Darrien Gordon, who returned a punt 90 yards for a touchdown 
earlier this season, went 75 yards for a score, and Ronnie Harmon's run for two 
points tied the game 1:48 into the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just a fantastic play," said Charger Coach Bobby Ross. "That kind of ignited 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this season, Green Bay used an 85-yard punt return in the third 
quarter for a touchdown to help overcome a 17-3 Ram halftime advantage, and New 
Orleans used two Tyrone Hughes kickoff returns to claim a 37-34 victory over 
the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "How unbelievable is that?" asked Ram cornerback Todd Lyght. "How many times 
have we gone into the locker room and come out flat in the third quarter?"  
</P>
<P>
 The Rams had the opportunity to immediately deflate the Chargers on the 
ensuing kickoff only to have Todd Kinchen's 99-yard return for a touchdown 
nullified by a holding penalty on linebacker Tom Homco. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Humphries' 10-yard touchdown pass to Harmon midway through the third 
quarter gave the Chargers a 21-14 lead, but the Rams were in position to tie 
the game in the closing seconds of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 On third and one from the Charger seven-yard line, the Rams opted not to give 
the ball to running back Jerome Bettis, and instead had quarterback Chris 
Miller rolling to his right to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "That kind of surprised me," said Bettis, who had 38 yards on 10 carries, "but 
the way our running game has been going, maybe they didn't think we could get 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who was chased by Charger defensive lineman Chris Mims, tried to 
squeeze a pass into Flipper Anderson's hands in the end zone, but Gordon got a 
hand on the ball, tipped it into the air and then caught it for the 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just trying to make a play, make something happen to help this team," 
said Miller, who completed 26 of 47 passes for 298 yards with four 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth quarter, the Chargers added a 37-yard John Carney field goal, 
his third successful kick of the day, and extended their lead to 24-14. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams tried to fight back with a trick play with Kinchen taking a punt and 
lateraling it to Lyght for a 27-yard return to the Chargers' 48-yard line. But 
again they were penalized for holding, and while they were able to eventually 
gain three points on Tony Zendejas' 33-yard kick, they were running out of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ram defense forced the Chargers to punt, and with 2:38 left the Rams had 
the ball and the chance to send the game into overtime. Jessie Hester dropped 
two passes and the Rams were out of timeouts, but still Miller got the Rams to 
their own 44-yard line with a little more than a minute to play. 
</P>
<P>
 On fourth and five, however, his pass for Hester landed in the hands of 
Charger cornerback Sean Vanhorse, who returned it 50 yards for the 
game-clinching touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have letdowns, you know," said Lyght, who has yet to experience a winning 
season with the Rams. "It's tough to keep going at this point, but we have no 
choice, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have lost three games in a row, and while earlier they were counting 
on the final four games on their schedule to propel them into the playoffs, 
they are all but mathematically eliminated from postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anyone has an answer to what's going on, I'll listen," said Ram linebacker 
Shane Conlan. "It's definitely not a lack of effort; it's just stupid stuff 
that we keep getting caught with. This team needs to grow up and start winning 
these games. I'm just tired of this crud."

GRUMPY RAIDERS FALL FLAT ON THEIR FACE; PRO FOOTBALL: THEIR 21-3 LOSS TO 
PITTSBURGH LEAVES BROWN QUESTIONING THE PLAY-CALLING AND PLAYOFF HOPES IN 
DOUBT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raider locker room was not a pretty sight after Sunday's crushing 21-3 
loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Jeff Hostetler had trouble seeing straight. Receiver Tim Brown had 
trouble seeing why he wasn't a bigger part of the game plan. 
</P>
<P>
 And all of the Raiders had trouble seeing themselves in the playoffs unless 
they can win their remaining four games. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the frustration and anger of this 6-6 season bubbled over again when 
Brown questioned the play-calling after catching only three passes on a day 
when the Pittsburgh offense ran all over the Raiders and the Steeler defense 
dominated the trenches and knocked Hostetler out of the game late in the first 
half with blurred vision and a splitting headache. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raider quarterback returned for part of the second half, but could do 
little against a relentless Steeler pass rush that recorded five sacks to add 
to its league-leading total of 40 to start the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers, who blitzed constantly and effectively all afternoon, also 
recovered two fumbles, one of those by Brown, who was matched up much of the 
afternoon against Pittsburgh cornerback Rod Woodson, the youngest member of the 
NFL's 75th anniversary all-star team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just blows my mind," said Brown of the Raider game plan. "Any time you go 
up against a great player, hopefully the player going up against him will rise 
to the occasion. I've been making the plays all year. It sort of disappointed 
me that (the Raiders lost) without giving me the opportunity to make the plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here a long time. The only way for me to get going is to get me the 
ball early. I come off, I beg, do whatever, but, for some reason, they had a 
different game plan. I'm sure they were afraid of him (Woodson). I hope 
everyone is disappointed. I'm disappointed I fumbled the ball. I'm disappointed 
I didn't get to make the plays. I'm sure the guy who called the plays, I'm sure 
Tom Walsh is not happy with his performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lose a game, we can't be happy. If we win the game and I only caught two 
passes, so be it." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said he told Woodson after the game, "I guess they (the Raider coaches) 
were afraid of you. I wasn't. But I guess the people calling the plays were." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he was specifically questioning the play-calling, Brown replied, "I 
am. I don't care what everybody else thinks." 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't the first time the play-calling has been an issue. When Hostetler 
and Coach Art Shell had their infamous blow-up on the sideline in Miami earlier 
this season, it was over Hostetler's decision to change two plays called by 
Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 But in reality, Sunday's game appeared to have little to do with the 
play-calling and everything to do with execution. 
</P>
<P>
 It figured to be a tough, defensive struggle. The Steelers came into the game 
leading the AFC in total defense. The Raiders came in leading the conference in 
run defense and had allowed a total of only 38 yards rushing in the last two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers were going with Mike Tomczak, their backup quarterback, because 
of injuries to starter Neil O'Donnell. And starting running back Barry Foster 
was making only his second start since recovering from a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomczak, who passed for a career-high 343 yards last week, didn't get anywhere 
near that total Sunday. But he completed the passes he needed to complete and 
had the time to do so because of the effectiveness of the Pittsburgh running 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomczak completed only 12 of 27 for 131 yards, his longest completion going 
for 27 yards. But he also threw two touchdown passes, the 27-yarder carried 
into the end zone by Yancey Thigpen in the first quarter to give the Steelers 
(9-3) a lead they would not relinquish. After Jeff Jaeger's 32-yard field goal 
made it a 7-3 game at the half, Tomczak connected with Eric Green on a 15-yard 
touchdown pass in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tomczak's efforts might have gone for naught had it not been for the 
running game. The Steelers rushed for only 24 yards in the first half, but they 
blew past the Raiders following intermission, going for 151 yards to give 
Pittsburgh a total of 175 rushing yards, the most the Raiders have surrendered 
all season. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh did a nice job of spreading it out. Foster rushed for 82 yards, Bam 
Morris had 50, including the three-yard, fourth-quarter scoring run that iced 
the victory, and John L. Williams added 40 more yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd of 58,327, largest of the season at the Coliseum for the Raiders, 
had little opportunity to cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 Never ahead in the game, the Raiders seemed helpless in the face of the 
blitzing Steelers, who got two sacks from Kevin Greene and one each from Chad 
Brown, Jason Gildon and Greg Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't help that Don Mosebar, the Raider center and the anchor of the 
offensive line, had to leave in the third quarter when he found he couldn't 
play because of a twisted left ankle, an injury he had suffered a week earlier 
and attempted to play through. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders were able to rush for only 57 yards, led by Harvey Williams' 42. 
</P>
<P>
 They did themselves in at several crucial points. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Trailing, 7-3, late in the first half, Hostetler, his vision already 
blurred, threw a pass to Williams on a fourth-and-seven at the Pittsburgh 
35-yard line, but Williams was stopped at the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On the opening drive of the third quarter, backup quarterback Vince Evans 
completed a pass to Brown, only to have Brown fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 -- With Pittsburgh still leading, 7-3, in the fourth quarter, Evans fumbled 
and the Steelers went on to score. 
</P>
<P>
 It was that kind of a day for the Raiders, a frustrating day. 
</P>
<P>
 And nobody was more frustrated than Brown.

FOR USC, CAUSE WAS GOOD, RESULT WAS BAD 
</P>

 Perhaps the best thing about USC's 65-54 loss to Temple on Sunday was that at 
least the Trojans lost for a good cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing in the inaugural Martin Luther King Classic doubleheader at The 
Pyramid, USC joined Temple, Georgetown and defending NCAA champion Arkansas in 
a fund-raising event created by the Black Coaches Assn. for underprivileged and 
unrepresented student-athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since I heard that we were playing in the first annual (MLK Classic), 
I've been excited because it means so much," USC guard Brandon Martin said. 
"It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience and, as a team, we had a great time off 
the court." 
</P>
<P>
 It was on the court that the Trojans had their problems in losing their second 
game of the season. USC was outrebounded, 45-25, shot only 37% from the floor 
and did not attempt a free throw in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, which lost its season-opener to New Mexico State in the Preseason NIT, 
did not start Lorenzo Orr or Jaha Wilson, who were benched for breaking team 
rules early in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 With sophomore David Crouse and freshman Cameron Murray making their first 
career starts, the Trojans got off fast in taking a 16-10 lead midway through 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple, which finished 23-8 last season, rallied to take a four-point lead 
behind the three-point shooting of Levan Auston and Rick Brunson. USC held on 
to trail, 35-32, at halftime thanks to the play of Wilson and Orr, who combined 
to score eight of the Trojans' final 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
 As they did against New Mexico State, the Trojans failed to keep pace with 
Temple at the start of the second half. The Owls held USC to only seven points 
over a nine-minute span as they took a 56-46 lead with four minutes remaining 
in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple, which had 17 offensive rebounds to USC's eight, was led by Jason 
Ivey's 15 points and 11 rebounds, and Lynard Stewart's 10 points and seven 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that hurt us more than anything was offensive rebounds," USC 
interim Coach Charlie Parker said. "Their offensive rebounds and our lack of 
offensive rebounds really killed us. We took good shots but we missed them, and 
if you do that you have to go and get them." 
</P>
<P>
 In playing in the second game of the doubleheader following local favorite 
Arkansas' victory over Georgetown, USC was led by Martin's 14 points and seven 
rebounds. Burt Harris was the only other Trojan to score in double figures with 
11 points. Wilson had a team-high 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned and we grew a little bit," Parker said. "We made strides in that 
we became a 30-minute team after playing 20 minutes in our first game. We were 
right in there until we started missing shots from the perimeter. Our goal now 
is to get those next 10 minutes and become a full 40-minute team," 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the efforts of recently retired Coach George Raveling, USC played a 
major role in the event, which proved to be more than a basketball doubleheader 
featuring four of the top African American coaches in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday night, the BCA held a benefit banquet and gave distinguished 
service awards to Georgetown's John Thompson, Temple's John Chaney, Arkansas' 
Nolan Richardson and Raveling. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling, who retired after suffering injuries in a Sept. 25 auto accident, 
did not attend because of travel restrictions placed on him by his doctors, but 
his presence was felt throughout the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "A very popular question to me has been 'How is George?' " Parker said. "The 
question is understandable because Coach Raveling had such a big influence on 
the creation of the MLK Classic. He wanted very badly to be here, if not as a 
coach then just as a spectator. He just wanted to be a part of this." 
</P>
<P>
 The BCA also honored future basketball Hall of Famer Michael Jordan, Cleveland 
Indian outfielder Albert Belle, filmmaker Spike Lee, South African president 
Nelson Mandela and Rev. Jesse Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "(School) presidents have tried to lock our children out of school," said 
Jackson, who received the Martin Luther King Jr. Leadership Award. "We don't 
need to lock up, we need to lift up. Coaches are one of the few groups that 
keep fighting to keep the door open for our children." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan and Belle were in attendance to accept their awards, while Lee missed 
the ceremony because his wife is about to give birth. Mandela gave his 
acceptance speech via video tape, saying, "I am honored to have my name 
associated with such a living spirit."

DALLAS COTTONS TO USC; SUGAR MAY GET REPLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Jan. 2 Cotton Bowl matchup with Texas Tech appeared Sunday to be the most 
likely bowl destination for USC's football team. 
</P>
<P>
 A muddled bowl picture cleared Sunday with an increased likelihood of Florida 
State playing in the Sugar Bowl, regardless of the outcome of the 
Alabama-Florida Southeastern Conference title game. 
</P>
<P>
 Under bowl coalition rules, that would leave Cotton officials to choose 
between USC (7-3-1), Notre Dame (6-4-1) and North Carolina (8-3), among others, 
to face Southwest Conference champion Texas Tech (6-5). 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, without knowing what shakes out after Florida-Alabama, I'd say USC 
is standing tall in our plans," Cotton Bowl president Robert Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame probably won't play in the Cotton Bowl for a third year in a row, 
Smith said. "Notre Dame has been here the last two years, and I feel they'd be 
a long shot for this time around," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Morning News on Sunday called Kansas State (9-2) a contender for a 
Cotton bid, but Smith said: "My hunch is, they're not in the mix for us." The 
Wildcats are expected to play in the Aloha Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Cotton Bowl makes its selection, Fiesta Bowl officials will pick an 
opponent to play Colorado (10-1). They are expected to select Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility that USC would go to the Sugar Bowl was apparently eliminated 
when Florida officials, who were thought to object to a Sugar Bowl rematch of 
Saturday's 31-31 tie with Florida State, said they would agree to play the 
Seminoles in New Orleans Jan. 2 if they win the SEC championship game on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no problem with that at all," Florida coach Steve Spurrier said. "If 
we're fortunate to win (the SEC title) that would be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Florida State interim Athletic Director Wayne Hogan said: "Both (Seminole 
Coach Bobby Bowden) and I are in agreement that we're not opposed to a rematch. 
We are not opposed to playing them again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that the (Sugar Bowl) would really want to have us either 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Sugar Bowl president Chuck Zatarain hinted as much Saturday, saying that if 
all parties were agreeable the coalition contract provides for a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 If Alabama (11-0) defeats Florida (9-1-1), the Crimson Tide would play Florida 
State (9-1-1) in the Sugar Bowl. The Alabama-Florida loser is locked into the 
Citrus Bowl, where it will play Ohio State (9-3). 
</P>
<P>
 The day after his team's 17-17 tie with Notre Dame, USC coach John Robinson 
said he had heard nothing about a Trojan bowl destination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anything definite, except that we're still in the mix for most 
of them," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Irish coach Lou Holtz said after Saturday's tie that he doubted Notre Dame 
would take a bowl bid, but added: "It's a university decision." 
</P>
<P>
 If, for some reason, the Sugar Bowl passes on Florida State, Hogan indicated 
the Seminoles would decline the Cotton invitation and go to the Fiesta for 
economic reasons. "I think they probably would offer to raise their pay," Hogan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Tech won four in a row at the end of its schedule before losing Friday 
to Texas Christian, 24-17. The Red Raiders lost to Nebraska, 42-16, in their 
second game, and to Oklahoma, 17-11, in their third game. 
</P>
<P>
 USC and Texas Tech defeated Baylor, their only common opponent. USC beat the 
Bears, 37-27; Texas Tech won, 38-7.

FINAL PUTT GETS WATSON OUT OF HOLE; GOLF: HE SINKS KEY SHOT IN SKINS GAME 
PLAYOFF AND FINISHES WITH $210,000 TOTAL ON A DAY WHEN THE GREENS PROVE 
ESPECIALLY TRICKY FOR ALL FOUR PLAYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Watson has a great sense of timing, which is nothing short of a good thing 
in the Skins Game. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a simple concept. If you're going to make one putt, you might as well be 
sure it's the one that is going to make you rich. 
</P>
<P>
 This Watsonian principal was worth $160,000 to the 45-year-old redhead, who 
coaxed a right-to-left downhill putt to drop on the first playoff hole to win 
the Skins Game on Sunday at Bighorn Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson added the $160,000 to the $50,000 he won Saturday on the front nine and 
finished with $210,000 to notch a victory by a small margin -- the width of his 
wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Couples was second with $170,000, all of it earned on one hole. Couples 
nudged a four-footer in the hole at No. 14 for a birdie that was worth five 
skins, four of them carried over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of shook it in," Couples said of his putt. 
</P>
<P>
 With a shake, a rattle and a roll, Watson, Couples, Paul Azinger and Payne 
Stewart spent most of the morning pushing golf balls around the greens. 
</P>
<P>
 As a whole, they couldn't buy a putt. They couldn't even rent one. There just 
weren't many great putts rolling in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone looked real confident with the putter out there," Watson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get a little nervous when you're putting for $100,000. That money does 
get your attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Until the playoff, Watson might as well have been swinging a cactus instead of 
a putter. He missed birdie putts of 15 feet at No. 11, six feet at No. 12, six 
feet at No. 14 and 20 feet on his first trip to No. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there was a putt really made all day until Tom's," Couples 
said. "That's kind of hard to believe." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson rolled in his money-maker from near the same spot on the green he had 
the first time. That meant Couples had to make his 16-footer for birdie to tie 
Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 But Couples missed slightly to the right and Watson got richer in a hurry, 
bagging the last four skins. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart and Azinger, the leaders after the first day, got shut out. Stewart 
kept busy hitting a ball in the sand while straddling a bush or knocking 
another one into the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played very poorly today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger could have saved his day if he had been able to make a simple 
six-footer at No. 13, worth $130,000. He sent it left, though, which enabled 
Couples to clean up at No. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was purely nerves to miss that putt," Azinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples probably has the best chances to win the money race. His chip on No. 
17, a $120,000 skin, spun around the hole and rimmed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples groaned, then tossed his sand wedge into the water. Couples said he 
threw it carefully, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't throw it very far out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then on No. 18, Couples sent a birdie putt inches left and the playoff was on. 
"We all had our chances," Couples said. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson finished with six skins, Couples with five, Azinger four for $80,000 
and Stewart three for $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson didn't exactly have a banner year, but he felt good enough Sunday to 
poke a little fun at himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't the icing on the cake, it's just the icing," he said.

MORNING BRIEFING: USC FREQUENTS PICK AND SAVE TO BUY A TIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 17-17 tie between USC and Notre Dame Saturday night at the Coliseum 
recalls a most unusual 13-13 standoff in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish outgained the Trojans, 406 yards to 53, and had an overwhelming 
margin in first downs, 18-1.  
</P>
<P>
 USC's Bud Langley scored a touchdown on a 99-yard pass interception -- still a 
Trojan record -- with referee Tom Louttit unintentionally running interference 
and screening a Notre Dame player in pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, USC Coach Howard Jones, in an understatement, said: "We were 
lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What was the outcome of the first Ram-Charger meeting, an 
exhibition game in 1967 in San Diego? 
</P>
<P>
 Forgotten: Ruben Rivera, 21-year-old Panamanian-born New York Yankee prospect, 
on being touted as the next Mickey Mantle or Joe DiMaggio: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anything about Mantle or DiMaggio. Were they as good as Ken 
Griffey Jr.?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ouch!Mary Foster of the Associated Press: "Why doesn't Baltimore have a 
professional football team? Because then, Washington would want one." 
</P>
<P>
 More problems: Todd Phipers in the Denver Post: "Here's how baseball operates 
under acting commissioner Bud Selig: 
</P>
<P>
 "The commissioner's office canceled the recent farm and scouting directors 
meeting in Florida, but failed to notify the hotel in time, so each team had to 
pay $1,200 in room guarantees." 
</P>
<P>
 Any takers?Blackie Sherrod in the Dallas Morning News: "If you're a 
10-handicapper, you're a pretty good weekend golfer. But if you played Nick 
Price you'd get 17 shots. His minus-7 is the lowest handicap ever awarded by 
Dean Knieth, the USGA chap in charge of assigning such numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 Weird report: Eddie Sefko in the Houston Chronicle: "Dennis Rodman might have 
some competition.  
</P>
<P>
 "Denver's Brian Williams, who is on the injured list, has shaved his head, 
gotten a nose ring and dyed his goatee blond, which only proves that when the 
going gets weird, the weird pierce something." 
</P>
<P>
 Party time: Ron Bellamy of the Eugene (Ore.) Register Guard: "I'm covering a 
team (Oregon) that's right on schedule -- every 37 years it goes to the Rose 
Bowl and I'm going to savor every minute of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back: On this day in 1929 Ernie Nevers scored six rushing touchdowns 
and kicked four extra points, an NFL record, as the Chicago Cardinals defeated 
the Chicago Bears, 40-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: The Rams won, 50-7, after leading, 43-0, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>

where he'll play next year: "How should I know? I'm Deion Sanders, not Dionne 
Warwick (of Psychic Friends fame)." MAL FLORENCE

 ODE TO A MOUSE 
</P>
<P>
 It was fun while it lasted. Loads of points. It gave the Raiders fits. But 
it's going, going, almost gone. 
</P>
<P>
 The run-and-shoot offense has all but been bullied out of the league by old 
liners, led by pulpit-pounders Buddy Ryan of Arizona and his defensive protege, 
new Houston Oiler Coach Jeff Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
 The run-and-shoot's death has been slow but sure. It first expired in Detroit 
and most recently in Houston. Atlanta is holding firm, but for how long? 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, the four-receiver offense is flawed. The lack of a tight end leaves 
the quarterback vulnerable. With no fullback, run-and-shooters have trouble 
scoring inside the 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the offense has never won a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, opposing defenses have at last figured it out. 
</P>
<P>
 But what have Ryan and Fisher offered us as an alternative? Ryan's 28th-ranked 
offense is one of the most primitive in modern times. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, the Cardinals (5-7) did not score an offensive touchdown in a 19-16 
overtime loss to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher, who junked the Oilers' run-and-shoot seconds after being named head 
coach, has lost two in a row with his "new" offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers (1-11) have scored 20 points in two losses under Fisher. Sunday, 
Cleveland walloped Houston, 34-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Atlanta, the Falcons' "Red Gun" took care of the Philadelphia 
Eagles, 28-21. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons' quarterbacks coach? 
</P>
<P>
 Darrel (Mouse) Davis, chief architect of the run-and-shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 Watch your back, Mouse. STREAKING BUCCANEERS 
</P>
<P>
 Once, UCLA's basketball team won 88 consecutive games. The 1971-72 Lakers 
strung 33 victories together. Notre Dame had defeated USC 11 years in a row 
until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 But how 'bout those Buccaneers? 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay, playing the Minnesota Vikings, had a chance to extend a legendary 
streak of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, a funny thing happened on the way to the record book. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay won. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Husted's 22-yard field goal at 12:52 of overtime snapped a six-game 
losing streak and made the Buccaneers winners, 20-17. 
</P>
<P>
 In victory, Tampa Bay improved to 3-9 and staved off its 12th consecutive 
season of 10 losses or more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buccaneers have a decent shot of finishing without another loss. By some 
quirk of schedule, they close against Washington twice, the Rams and Green Bay. 
DECEMBER MOURN 
</P>
<P>
 The Miami Dolphins and New York Jets, teams that have tip-toed into December 
of late, met at the Meadowlands. Something had to give. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins were 9-12 in December games since 1989, the Jets 6-14. 
</P>
<P>
 First place in the AFC East was at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets (6-6) blew a 24-6 lead and stood around on defense as Miami 
quarterback Dan Marino faked a spike to kill the clock and tossed the 
game-winning pass, an eight-yard throw to Mark Ingram with 22 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets had history on their side. They have not won a divisional title since 
the AFL-NFL merger in 1970. In 1986, the Jets started 10-1 and finished 10-6. 
New York's last title was 1969, when it captured the AFL's Eastern Division 
championship. TURKEY LEFTOVERS 
</P>
<P>
 In case you missed it, the Buffalo Bills, losers of four consecutive Super 
Bowls, took it on the chin with a Thanksgiving Day loss to the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, it was another reason to give thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a good chance the Bills won't repeat as AFC champions. At 6-6, in 
fact, making the playoffs will be a chore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six losses. We haven't had a six-loss season since I got here, and this is my 
fifth season," said defensive end Phil Hansen. "All we can do now is win these 
last four games, and hope some other teams lose." NOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 John Elway reached 3,000 yards passing for the ninth time in his career. Only 
Miami's Dan Marino has more 3,000-yard seasons; Marino did it for the 10th time 
this year. . . . Herschel Walker's 91-yard run for a touchdown for the Eagles 
was the longest in the three-year history of the Georgia Dome and the longest 
in the NFL since the Raiders' Bo Jackson ran 92 yards for one against 
Cincinnati on Nov. 5, 1989. . . . Norm Johnson's four extra points gave him 135 
in a row, one more than the Falcon record previously held by Mick Luckhurst. . 
. . The Eagles have lost three in a row for the first time since September, 
1988. . . . Atlanta tackle Mike Kenn played in his 247th career game, moving 
out of a tie with former Falcon center Jeff Van Note for the most in club 
history. He ranks seventh on the NFL list of games played. . . . Eric Allen's 
interception was the 34th of his career, tying him with Bill Bradley for the 
Eagles' team record. . . . Art Monk of the Jets is now within one game and one 
catch of a prestigious record. Monk needs one reception next week at New 
England to tie Steve Largent's mark of 177 consecutive games with a catch. . . 
. Deep Fryar: Miami's Irving Fryar, one of four receivers with more than 100 
yards receiving Sunday, surpassed 1,000 for the season for the third time. He 
now has 1,059. . . . Miami's Mark Ingram caught four touchdown passes, tying 
Paul Warfield's club record. . . . Dan Marino has guided 26 fourth-quarter 
comebacks, including five against the Jets. . . . Cris Carter's first catch of 
the game broke the Vikings' season record of 88 catches set by Rickey Young in 
1978. Carter finished with five catches to push his NFL-leading total to 93. He 
needs 20 more in four games to break Sterling Sharpe's all-time record. . . . 
That's incredible: Terry Allen ran 16 times for 54 yards to pass Fran Tarkenton 
and move into seventh place on the Vikings' all-time rushing list. Tarkenton, 
the scrambling quarterback who led Minnesota to three of its four Super Bowls, 
had 2,543 rushing yards. Allen has 2,575. . . . The defense doesn't rest: The 
Cleveland Browns have yielded only five touchdowns in six home games this year. 
The Brown defense has not allowed a 100-yard rusher or receiver this season. . 
. . Careful, hot Stover: Matt Stover has made 14 consecutive field goals for 
Cleveland, tying Matt Bahr for the second-best streak in team history. Don 
Cockroft set the team record by making 16 in a row from 1974-75. . . . Steve 
Walsh improved to 7-0 as a starter for the Bears this season. . . . Tampa Bay 
continued its masterful punt coverage, allowing Minnesota no yards on two 
returns. The Buccaneers came into the game allowing only 34 punt-return yards 
all season, more than 100 yards better than the second-best team, the New York 
Giants. . . . Drew Bledsoe became New England's all-time single-season passing 
yardage leader with 3,526, topping Babe Parilli's record of 3,465 set in 1964. 
TONIGHT'S GAME: San Francisco at New Orleans 
</P>
<P>
 6 p.m., Channel 7 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Young has led San Francisco to two difficult victories in the last two 
weeks, and that seems to have taken the 49ers to a higher level of play. 
</P>
<P>
 Young completed 30 of 44 passes for 325 yards and four touchdowns without an 
interception against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Rice caught a team-record 16 of those passes for 165 yards and three 
touchdowns. Rice has set an NFL-record with nine consecutive 1,000-yard 
seasons, breaking a tie with Steve Largent.  
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers (9-2) have won six consecutive games since being embarrassed, 40-8, 
by Philadelphia. San Francisco's average margin of victory since then is 16 
points. The 49ers are second in the league in scoring with 326 points, nine 
points behind the Dallas Cowboys, but the Cowboys have played one more game. 
</P>
<P>
 If the 49ers win, they will clinch their 11th NFC West title in 14 years. They 
also would clinch their 12th consecutive season with at least 10 victories. 
</P>
<P>
 You never know what you're going to get with the Saints (4-7). 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Mario Bates rushed for 153 yards two weeks ago, but the Saints as 
team gained only 16 in 11 carries against the Raiders last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Everett is piling up passing yards playing catch-up each week, but he has 
also gained significant yardage in the Saint victories. AND THE WINNER IS. . .  
</P>
<P>
 With four weeks left, here's the inside track for coach-of-the-year honors: 
</P>
<P>
 1). Dave Wannstedt, Chicago. The Bears are 8-4 and in sole possession of first 
place in the NFC Central. They're doing it without a household name on offense 
or defense. It took guts for Wannstedt to sit down Erik Kramer, the team's 
high-priced millionaire, and play backup Steve Walsh, who is 7-0 as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
 2). Bill Belichick, Cleveland. The Browns (9-3) are flip-flopping quarterbacks 
and getting away with it. Sunday, Vinny Testaverde got the start over Mark 
Rypien and led his team to a 24-point victory over Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 3). Bill Cowher, Pittsburgh. Came into Los Angeles with his backup 
quarterback, Mike Tomczak, and left with a 21-3 victory against the Raiders. 
Steelers (9-3) win to keep pace with the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 4). George Seifert, San Francisco. Almost run out of town two months ago, 
Seifert's 49ers have won seven in a row and can clinch the NFC West tonight 
with a victory against New Orleans in the Superdome. 
</P>
<P>
 5). Wade Phillips, Denver. Can you believe it? After a horrible start, the 
Broncos have won five of six games to get back to .500. 
</P>
<P>
 6). Mike Ditka, NBC. From the studio, he's made quick, decisive decisions for 
all 28 coaches in the league. Lacks only a team to coach. BACK IN SADDLE 
AGAINST BRONCOS 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't look like much in the Cincinnati Bengals' game statistics: eight 
carries for 52 yards. But running back Steve Broussard's performance against 
Denver ranks as one of the day's highlights. 
</P>
<P>
 Broussard was back in the lineup only two weeks after suffering temporary 
paralysis in both legs Nov. 13 when he took a hit in the neck by Houston's Al 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Broussard lay on the turf with what doctors described as "two dead legs." 
</P>
<P>
 After conferring with medical experts and doing some soul searching, Broussard 
decided to resume his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Bengals suffered a tough 15-13 loss to the Broncos, it wouldn't 
have been the same without Broussard. JUST ANOTHER GAME 
</P>
<P>
 Remember when the New York Giants versus the Washington Redskins used to be a 
big enough game for John Madden to cover? 
</P>
<P>
 Now, of course, it's a battle of also-rans. For what it's worth, in a cold, 
driving rain at RFK Stadium, the Giants defeated the Redskins, 21-19. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants improved to 5-7. The Redskins fell to 2-10. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants started Dave Brown at quarterback, the Redskins opted for Heath 
Shuler. 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly Phil Simms versus Joe Theismann. 
</P>
<P>
 Madden? He took the motor coach south to Atlanta to chronicle a Fox telecast 
between Atlanta and Philadelphia. QUOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 "If we want to get anywhere, we better bounce back . If we want to feel sorry 
for ourselves, the Bears will have a feast."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Minnesota receiver Qadry Ismail after his team's 20-17 overtime loss to 
Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope I won't be around much longer. The way they've treated me, I can't see 
putting out much effort for these people . "  
</P>
<P>
 -- Houston receiver Webster Slaughter, continuing to complain about his team's 
decision to abandon the run-and-shoot offense. 
</P>
<P>
 'Our defense can win games for us. I talked to them about having to step up 
and play. They did it today, and this is the kind of effort we're looking for 
over the next four games."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Denver Coach Wade Phillips, speaking about his much-maligned defense 
following the Broncos' 15-13 victory over Cincinnati.

BLEDSOE, COATES GET YARDAGE, BAHR POINTS FOR PATRIOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Whenever New England needed some yardage, Drew Bledsoe threw the ball to tight 
end Ben Coates. Whenever the Patriots needed some points, Matt Bahr did his 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe and Coates set up four field goals by Bahr in a 12-10 victory over the 
Indianapolis Colts on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to throw to Ben Coates every play," said Bledsoe, the NFL's leading 
passer, who set a team single-season passing yardage record. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve of his completions went to Coates, who had 119 yards and became the 
NFL's first tight end with 1,000 yards in receptions in a season since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 New England (6-6), which won its third consecutive game, moved into a 
three-way tie with Buffalo and the New York Jets for second place in the AFC 
East, two games behind Miami with four to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Indianapolis (5-7) took a 10-9 lead on a 50-yard field goal by Dean Biasucci 
with 10:22 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe then completed five consecutive passes on the next possession, 
including three to Coates, who juggled the last one before hauling it in to 
give the Patriots a key first down and set up the go-ahead 42-yard field goal 
by Bahr with 4:01 to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe was 26 of 36 for 271 yards and raised his season total to 3,526 yards, 
breaking the former team record of 3,465 set by Babe Parilli in 1964.

MARINO THE MAGICIAN STRIKES AGAIN; AFC: INGRAM CATCHES FOUR TOUCHDOWN PASSES, 
FAKE SPIKE CATCHES JETS NAPPING IN DOLPHINS' 28-24 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dan Marino, who has pulled some pretty nifty tricks during his career, used a 
fake spike that worked to perfection in providing the Miami Dolphins with the 
winning touchdown in a 28-24 come-from-behind victory over the New York Jets on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 With time running out and the Dolphins out of timeouts, Marino acted as if he 
were going to spike the ball to stop the clock with 22 seconds to play. 
Instead, he threw an eight-yard touchdown pass to a wide-open Mark Ingram. 
</P>
<P>
 "Credit Bernie with coming up with that play," Marino said of backup Bernie 
Kosar, who used the gambit while with Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kosar, "It's a play we used when I was younger. I called it on the 
headset before the play. We put it in the playbook a few weeks ago and we've 
been tinkering with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins' tinkering helped them take a two-game lead in the AFC East as 
they rallied from 17-0 and 24-6 deficits. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram scored Miami's four touchdowns, all in the second half, and Marino 
completed 24 of 30 passes in the second half, the last one fooling the Jets 
(6-6). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a clock play," Marino said. "We've talked about it, it just never 
came up. I called the play to throw it into the ground. Mark's the only guy who 
has got to know what I'm really doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Aaron Glenn, who was beaten by Ingram for two touchdowns -- as was 
teammate James Hasty -- certainly didn't know what was going on. He had his 
back to the quarterback when the pass came. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the other defenders stopped on the play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really thought he was going to spike it," said Glenn, who had his worst 
game of an otherwise strong rookie year. "It looked like he was going to stop 
the clock. By the time I caught up with what was happening, (Ingram) was behind 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Dolphins (8-4) were winners, despite being outplayed for the first 40 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Marino went to work. With the Dolphins trailing, 24-6 (a conversion 
pass failed after Ingram's first touchdown reception), Marino completed five of 
six passes on a 67-yard drive and connected with Ingram over Glenn for a 
17-yard touchdown. Then Marino and Irving Fryar beat Glenn on a two-point 
conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy Vincent's interception at the Miami 37 gave Marino another chance early 
in the fourth quarter. He needed only five plays -- all completions -- to go 63 
yards, with Ingram scoring on a 28-yard pass play, making it 24-21. 
</P>
<P>
 Marino got the ball again with 2:34 remaining. He completed seven of eight 
passes in taking the Dolphins 84 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 For the game, Marino was 31 of 44 for 359 yards, and Ingram had nine 
receptions for 117.

BRONCOS AT .500, BUT IT'S NOTHING TO BRAG ABOUT; AFC: THEY GET KEY DEFENSIVE 
PLAY TO BARELY BEAT BENGALS IN DENVER, 15-13. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Denver Broncos completed their torturous climb back to .500 by barely 
outlasting the Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
 John Elway threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Anthony Miller and Jason Elam 
kicked three field goals as the Broncos edged the Bengals, 15-13, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was all right," Denver Coach Wade Phillips said. "Another win at home, 
and we'll take it. Our defense (ranked last in the NFL) played an outstanding 
game, but our offense certainly had problems in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos, who did not score after intermission, had only 53 total yards in 
the second half, including minus-four in the third quarter, finishing with 256 
compared to Cincinnati's 328. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver (6-6), which has won six of its last eight games after an 0-4 start, 
needed a key defensive play with 3:36 left to preserve the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bengals (2-10) had marched to the Denver 20 when Harold Green took a 
handoff to the left side. Safety Steve Atwater's hit sent Green reeling 
backward, and he was tackled by Ted Washington, forcing a fumble that was 
recovered by linebacker Elijah Alexander at the 33. Denver then ran out the 
clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Atwater said he got a jump on the play, reading run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just came up as hard as I could," he said. "I saw (fullback Derrick) Fenner 
and I saw Green running behind him. I hit Fenner and knocked him back into 
Green. Then three other guys came over and all of us gang-tackled and somebody 
caused the fumble. The next thing you know, Eli is running the other way. We 
thought it was a touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
 The officials ruled Alexander had stepped out of bounds after a nine-yard 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a wind gusting to 37 m.p.h., Elway completed 21 of 38 passes for 239 
yards, giving him his ninth 3,000-yard passing season.

MONTANA GOES OUT, AND CHIEFS GO DOWN; AFC: QUARTERBACK REACHES 40,000-YARD MARK 
BUT IS INJURED DURING 10-9 LOSS TO SEAHAWKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After Joe Montana left the field with a foot injury, almost everything went 
wrong for the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 And things could get worse if Montana's injury turns out to be serious. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seattle Seahawks scored 10 points in the fourth quarter Sunday to defeat 
Kansas City, 10-9, dropping the Chiefs two games behind San Diego in the AFC 
West. 
</P>
<P>
 The lone positive for Montana and the Chiefs was that, with 163 yards passing, 
the 38-year-old quarterback surpassed 40,000 career yards, only the fifth NFL 
quarterback to do so. The others are Fran Tarkenton, Dan Marino, Dan Fouts and 
Johnny Unitas. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, the Chiefs were tight-lipped about the seriousness of 
Montana's injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you anything at this time," Coach Marty Schottenheimer said 
before boarding a bus to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana didn't make himself available to the media, and the Chiefs' public 
relations director, Bob Moore, did not get off the bus to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs (7-5) initially said Montana had a sprained left foot, but that was 
before X-rays were taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana apparently was injured with about six minutes gone in the third 
quarter when he threw an incomplete pass on a third-and-11 play. He was hit by 
three defenders and fell hard to the AstroTurf. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana came back out the next time the Chiefs had the ball and ran one play 
-- a handoff. After Steve Bono replaced him with 5:04 left in the quarter, the 
Chiefs' trainers looked at Montana's foot and sent him to the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle's winning points came on John Kasay's 32-yard field goal with 1:42 to 
play, giving the Seahawks their second consecutive come-from-behind victory 
after six losses in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Chiefs' lasts possession, Lake Dawson fumbled after catching a pass 
with 1:01 left, and Robert Blackmon recovered and returned it 17 yards to the 
Kansas City 15. Rolling Up the Yardage 
</P>

TESTAVERDE BACK, GETS JOB DONE; AFC: PLAYING A FULL GAME FOR FIRST TIME IN SIX 
WEEKS, HE COMMITS TWO TURNOVERS BUT STILL LEADS BROWNS OVER OILERS, 34-10. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in his NFL career, Vinny Testaverde is playing games that 
mean something. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm having as much fun with this as I can.Hopefully the rest of the team and 
the rest of the city will enjoy it along with me," Testaverde said Sunday after 
he returned to the starting lineup and directed the Cleveland Browns past the 
Houston Oilers, 34-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing a full game for the first time in six weeks, Testaverde committed two 
turnovers in Houston territory but also threw two touchdown passes, helping the 
Browns (9-3) send the Oilers (1-11) to their eighth consecutive loss. The 
Oilers are 0-2 since Jeff Fisher moved up from defensive coordinator to replace 
Jack Pardee. 
</P>
<P>
 Leroy Hoard made Testaverde's return easier, running 23 times for 103 yards 
and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Testaverde is now ensured of being on a winning team for the first time in his 
eight seasons with Tampa Bay and Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Rypien had started the previous three games after Testaverde was knocked 
out of the final two games in October because of concussions. Testaverde worked 
briefly in relief in a loss at Kansas City last week. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, he was intercepted by Darryll Lewis in the end zone in the first 
quarter, was nearly intercepted at least two other times, and fumbled the ball 
away when he was sacked by Lamar Lathon in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Testaverde, who completed 15 of 28 passes for 199 yards, was on target 
when he had to be. He threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Frank Hartley early in 
the second quarter, and an 11-yarder to Brian Kinchen later in the quarter.

GORDON HELPS REVITALIZE CHARGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Darrien Gordon, defensive back, punt returner and founder of the Save the San 
Diego Chargers Foundation, held the team together Sunday at Jack Murphy 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 A team once on the move had bogged down. The Chargers, winners of their first 
six games, had lost three of five. The offense had taken an extended holiday. 
The team's staying power was in doubt with a brutal December schedule ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone had to do something. 
</P>
<P>
 In stepped Gordon. His 75-yard punt return got the Chargers breathing. His 
interception in the end zone got their blood going. 
</P>
<P>
 It all led to a 31-17 victory over the Rams, the Chargers' first giant step 
forward since those heady days of October. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time I get my hands on the ball, there's an opportunity for a big play," 
Gordon said. "It just takes a few seconds for something big to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 And Gordon knew it was time to do something huge. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the last gimme on the Chargers' schedule. The going-nowhere-but St. 
Louis Rams were the only team with a losing record left on their schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble lay ahead, with a stretch run of the Raiders, San Francisco 49ers, New 
York Jets and Pittsburgh Steelers. The Chargers, clinging to a one-game lead 
over Kansas City, couldn't pass on an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a team we were suppose to beat," Gordon said. "You look at the 
perennially good teams, like the 49ers. The teams they were supposed to beat, 
they beat handily. We didn't do that, but we got the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Gordon did. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers continued their sluggish ways through the first half. Even Gordon 
was flat-footed, having been beaten deep by Jessie Hester on a 40-yard 
touchdown play that broke a scoreless tie in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams led, 14-6, early in the third quarter when Gordon decided to take 
charge. He fielded Sean Landeta's punt on the 25, ran to the left sideline and 
was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went back, caught the ball and it seemed like it was over in an instant," 
Gordon said. "It all happened in a flash." 
</P>
<P>
 It was his second punt return for a touchdown this season, as he went 90 yards 
against the Raiders. Not bad for a guy Charger coaches didn't want to use as a 
punt returner. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon was second in the AFC in punt-return average last season, but the 
Chargers tinkered with using rookie Andre Coleman during training camp. Gordon 
talked them out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams wished he'd kept his mouth shut. Gordon returned six for 128 yards 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 His touchdown seemed to kick start the offense. Quarterback Stan Humphries 
drove the team 52 yards and tossed a 10-yard touchdown pass to Ronnie Harmon on 
the Chargers' next possession. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers were still a little wobbly, even after taking a 21-14 lead. Chris 
Miller took the Rams to the Charger seven late in the third quarter. But, on 
third and one, Gordon was there to prop up the Chargers once again. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller scrambled right and looked for Flipper Anderson, who was lurking in the 
back of the end zone. Miller spotted him, but didn't see Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon tipped the ball, had it bounce off his helmet, then snatched it out of 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what all it hit," Gordon said. "I just saw it sitting there and 
I said, 'I better grab that because Flipper will be looking for it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon didn't keep it long. After being tackled, he ran to the stands and 
handed the ball to a fan. He had done the same thing after returning the punt 
for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got to live for the moment," Gordon said. "I wanted the fans to feel a 
part of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 That's just Gordon: Chairman of Fan Appreciation Day.

STEELERS STILL HAVE WORK TO DO; AFC: COWHER PRAISES HIS TEAM BUT SAYS NEW 
'STEEL CURTAIN' HAS MORE TO ACCOMPLISH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Cowher didn't intend to be rude; the Pittsburgh Steelers' coach simply 
didn't want to take credit for a job he feels is not yet done. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why, when asked if his defense is as good as the vaunted "Steel Curtain 
Defense" of the great Pittsburgh teams of the 1970s, he shook his head even 
before the question was completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's unfair to compare this with anything until this thing is said 
and done," Cowher said after the Steelers' 21-3 victory over the Raiders on 
Sunday at the Coliseum. "We haven't accomplished a thing. We can still improve. 
If we take this objectively, we'll be fine. If we start reading our press 
clippings, we'll go to the outhouse as fast as we got to the penthouse." 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers (9-3) retained a share of the AFC Central lead -- and remained 
tied with the Cleveland Browns and San Diego Chargers for the best record in 
the conference -- with a performance Cowher could hardly fault. 
</P>
<P>
 After keeping the Raiders out of the end zone Sunday, the Steelers have given 
up only 85 points in their last eight games. They held the Raiders to 57 yards 
rushing, the eighth time they've held an opponent to fewer than 100 rushing 
yards. And, by sacking Raider quarterbacks Jeff Hostetler and Vince Evans five 
times, they ran their league-leading total to 45 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "A very impressive win," Cow-her said. "I can't say enough about the way we 
came out and went about our business." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders knew what the Steelers' business would be -- blitz, blitz and 
blitz again -- yet they were powerless to stop it. They tried to sidestep that 
by keeping to the ground, but the Steelers were ready for that too. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kind of thought they were going to try and come out and establish the 
running game because that's what most teams try to do," said linebacker Kevin 
Greene, the former Ram. "I don't think they did anything surprising." 
</P>
<P>
 Greene, who has become an integral part of what might be the NFL's best 
defensive unit, said he does not miss playing in Southern California. He still 
has a house here, but his heart is in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams were playing me out of position. The Steelers are a playoff 
contender, and I knew I was going to have fun," said Greene, who had five 
tackles Sunday and shared in another, in addition to two sacks. "It's just fun 
to play in a defense where they play you to the best of your abilities." 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers got the most out of their offense too. Led by running back Barry 
Foster, who had 82 yards in 20 carries, they ran for 175 yards against a Raider 
defense that had given up only 38 yards rushing in its previous two games. 
Quarterback Mike Tomczak, starting in place of the injured Neil O'Donnell for 
the second successive week, completed 12 of 27 passes for 131 yards, showing 
poise and creativity at every turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving the Steelers 80 yards to their first touchdown, he mixed handoffs to 
Foster (four times) and Bam Morris (once) with a pass out of the shotgun to 
Ernie Mills for 10 yards on a third-and-eight. He found Eric Green for a 
20-yard pass on third and two at the Steeler 40-yard line, and finished it off 
with a 27-yard pass to Yancey Thigpen after Foster had been pushed back for a 
one-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
 For his effort, Tomczak got a seat on the bench next week. Cowher said 
O'Donnell will start against Cincinnati, a decision Tomczak accepted 
gracefully. 
</P>
<P>
 "So be it. I have no problem with that," said Tomczak, who collected a 
career-high 343 yards last week in the Steelers' 16-13 overtime victory over 
Miami. "I've played enough games to satisfy my ego. Sure, it's reassuring when 
you can come in and play well. There's not much job security in this 
profession." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing he does have is a Super Bowl ring. He earned it in 1985, as Jim 
McMahon's backup with the Chicago Bears, and playing only a secondary role in 
another triumph wouldn't bother him. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I flash it to people, they say, 'How'd you get that?' " he said. "It 
doesn't say backup. It says team. It says championship. That's what's 
important."

HOSTETLER BRUISED, BATTERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They came at him from his left. From his right. From in front and from behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Raider quarterback Jeff Hostetler is known for his toughness in the face of 
oncoming pressure, for his cool demeanor in the worst of situations. 
</P>
<P>
 He always thinks he can pull out any game he's in, can avoid any onrushing 
lineman heading his way. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's only if he knows what game he's in, if he can see those linemen 
heading his way. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the second quarter of a 21-3 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday 
at the Coliseum, Hostetler wasn't sure of anything. 
</P>
<P>
 His troubles began when he scrambled for a first down on the Raiders' 
next-to-last series of the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler, needing five yards, assured himself he had it, then hit the ground. 
But not in time to avoid the force of linebacker Chad Brown coming down on top 
of him. 
</P>
<P>
 As the officials called time for a measurement, Coach Art Shell came over to 
talk to his quarterback. It was like a trainer talking to a fighter who has 
taken one punch too many. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was woozy," Shell said. "I asked him if he knew where he was and he said 
he was OK. But he wasn't the same after that." 
</P>
<P>
 It got worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the same drive, Hostetler stayed in the pocket and faced a full 
frontal assault by blitzing safety Gary Jones, who left his feet to knock 
Hostetler down. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raider quarterback got groggily to his feet for one more play. This time, 
he completed a pass to Harvey Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler took yet another shot, this one delivered by blitzing linebacker 
Kevin Greene. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hostetler lay on the Coliseum grass, Greene talked to the Raider 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to hurt nobody," Greene said. "I was just trying to help him 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler, suffering from blurred vision and a splitting headache, sat out the 
final drive of the half. He came back for one series in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was taking more shots," said Shell, who gave his quarterback the rest of 
the afternoon off. "I didn't want to have that." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked after the game how he was doing, Hostetler, who completed eight of 17 
passes for 85 yards, replied, "Just say I don't feel well."

DROPPED PUNT DROPS VIKINGS; NFC: GULIFORD'S BOBBLE IN OVERTIME SETS UP A TAMPA 
BAY FIELD GOAL FOR A 20-17 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Minnesota Vikings were thinking Super Bowl three weeks ago. Now, they 
can't even beat Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Guliford's dropped punt early in overtime led to a 22-yard field goal by 
Michael Husted and a 20-17 victory for the Buccaneers, who snapped a six-game 
losing streak and sent the Vikings to their third loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a fitting finish to a bumbling afternoon for the Vikings (7-5), who 
fell to second place in the NFC Central behind Chicago (8-4). 
</P>
<P>
 "If we want to get anywhere, we better bounce back," said Minnesota receiver 
Qadry Ismail. "If we want to feel sorry for ourselves, the Bears will have a 
feast." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings never led after Tampa Bay (3-9) turned an early Warren Moon 
interception into a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Vikings tied the score 17-17 with 1:27 left in regulation on Ismail's 
spectacular diving 40-yard touchdown catch in the back of the end zone and 
Moon's two-point conversion pass to Cris Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa won the toss in overtime but was forced to punt from the Vikings' 44. 
Guliford fielded Dan Stryzinski's first punt cleanly at the 18, but an offsides 
penalty was called against Minnesota's Martin Harrison for lining up in the 
neutral zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buccaneers chose to punt over, and Stryzinski's high kick bounced off 
Guliford's chest after Tampa Bay's Curtis Buckley knocked Minnesota's Brad 
Davis into Guliford from the side. 
</P>
<P>
 Guliford said he never felt Davis bump him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just dropped it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Brady recovered at the four, and Husted's kick following a timeout gave the 
Buccaneers a victory in their first overtime game since they beat the Vikings 
at the Metrodome in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Curtis was the man who made the play, I was just in the right place at the 
right time," Brady said. "The ball looked as big as a pumpkin sitting there. 
The way the ball has been bouncing the other way lately, this really felt 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings rarely got pressure on Tampa quarterback Craig Erickson, failing 
to get a sack for the second time in three games. Minnesota did end its streak 
of pass attempts without an interception at 130 on Anthony Parker's 
second-quarter interception, which set up the first of Fuad Reveiz's three 
field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Erickson was 20 of 38 for 254 yards and a touchdown as Tampa Bay avoided 
-- probably only temporarily -- its 12th consecutive season with at least 10 
losses. Courtney Hawkins had six catches for 80 yards and a 14-yard touchdown 
catch that helped Tampa build a 14-9 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buccaneers kept the ball away from the Vikings in the second half with two 
drives of at least seven minutes. Tampa Bay also sacked Moon five times, four 
times in the first half, after managing nine sacks in the first 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the greatest win I've ever had as a pro," said nose tackle Brad 
Culpepper, who was cut by the Vikings before the season and had one of Sunday's 
sacks. "This was a tremendous accomplishment for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota, which has gone into overtime in three of the last six games, has 
seen its seemingly comfortable two-game lead in the Central disappear because 
of defensive breakdowns and costly turnovers.

BROWN LEAVES REDSKINS OUT IN COLD; NFC: GIANT QUARTERBACK PASSES FOR TWO 
TOUCHDOWNS AND RUNS FOR ANOTHER IN A DRIVING RAIN DURING 21-19 VICTORY OVER 
WASHINGTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the muddy depths of the NFC East, Dave Brown and the New York Giants 
withstood a cold, driving rainstorm for a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown passed for two touchdowns and ran for another Sunday in the Giants' 
21-19 victory over the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive victory for the Giants (5-7) after a seven-game 
losing streak during which Brown lost his job to Kent Graham. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Brown started against Houston but a concussion forced him out and 
Graham led the team to a 13-10 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy that the team got the monkey off its back last week," said Brown. 
"This week, I got the monkey off my back. I haven't had a win since the last 
time we played Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who led the Giants to a 31-23 victory over Washington on Sept. 18, 
completed 10 of 17 passes for 161 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redskins (2-10) failed to get anything going, scoring their points on four 
field goals by Chip Lohmiller and a 60-yard fumble return by Martin Bayless. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redskins have lost 14 consecutive NFC East games and are 0-7 at home this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "For whatever reason, we don't make the plays when we have to," Redskin Coach 
Norv Turner said. "This is a very competitive level of football, and the New 
York Giants are capable of making plays. When you're in this position, mistakes 
are things that end up costing you." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown connected on touchdown pass plays with Chris Calloway and Mike Sherrard. 
Rodney Hampton had 106 yards in 34 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Heath Shuler, meanwhile, started for the Redskins for the first time 
since he sprained his ankle against Arizona on Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 The rookie began poorly -- he was four of 14 for 69 yards and an interception 
in the first half -- and finished 11 of 28 for 165 yards.

BEARS ALONE IN FIRST AFTER OVERTIME WIN; NFC: WALSH-TO-GRAHAM BOMB SETS UP 
BUTLER'S GAME-WINNING FIELD GOAL AGAINST ARIZONA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kevin Butler kicked the Chicago Bears right into first place in the NFC 
Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have been Greg Davis or me there at the end. Either one of us could 
have done it," Butler said Sunday after his fourth field goal of the day, a 
27-yarder with 6:49 left in overtime, ended his duel with the Arizona kicker 
and gave Chicago a 19-16 victory over the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears (8-4), who learned during the game that Tampa Bay had beaten the 
Vikings, took over sole possession of the division lead heading into a Thursday 
night game at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels great, but there's still four or five games left," Coach Dave 
Wannstedt said. "We still have a big game at Minnesota." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona (5-7) needs to win its last four games to finish above .500 under 
first-year Coach Buddy Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way you tackle in a football game is a great indicator of how ready you 
are to play," Ryan said. "Our tackling today was unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals seemed out of it until defensive end Keith McCants batted a pass 
by Steve Walsh, pulled it down and lumbered 46 yards to score with 7:36 to play 
and cut Chicago's lead to 16-13. 
</P>
<P>
 After Arizona's defense held, Jay Schroeder led a 13-play drive that ended in 
Davis' game-tying 47-yard field goal with 58 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis then squibbed the kickoff, it hit Chicago's Bob Christian and Terry 
Irving of the Cardinals recovered it on his own 45-yard line. But the Bears 
held at midfield and time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're starting to come into our own," Wannstedt said. "We're not 
giving up. For them to come back the way they did, and for us to hold our 
composure and still have a chance to win at the end, it says a lot for this 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona received the overtime kickoff but had to punt after one first down. A 
pair of six-yard passes to Greg McMurtry and Jeff Graham preceded a 44-yard 
Walsh-to-Graham bomb that moved the ball to the 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh said he saw Cardinal safety Terry Hoage racing to the sideline to cover 
another receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had kind of a fly route called on the outside, and when I turned to look 
to throw it to Nate (Lewis), their free safety, who had middle-of-the-field 
responsibility, just flew over there," Walsh said. "When he went so hard over 
there, I knew Jeff was lurking in the middle of the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Graham, "They blitzed everybody; they brought the house, I made an 
adjustment, and Steve just laid it over the middle." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler hit his winning kick three plays later.

FALCONS OVERCOME WALKER'S 91-YARD RUN; NFC: GEORGE AND MATHIS ACCOUNT FOR TWO 
SCORES TO LEAD ATLANTA TO A 28-21 VICTORY OVER PHILADELPHIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff George and Terance Mathis put a damper on Herschel Walker's return to 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 George threw for 364 yards and combined with Mathis on two touchdown passes 
Sunday, giving Atlanta a 28-21 victory over Philadelphia despite a 91-yard 
touchdown run by Walker, who won a Heisman Trophy 12 years ago at Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker's run, longest from scrimmage in the NFL since Bo Jackson went 92 yards 
for the Raiders five years ago, gave the Eagles a 14-13 lead 2:45 into the 
second half. It came one play after Bill Romanowski intercepted a deflected 
pass to end what looked like an Atlanta scoring drive. 
</P>
<P>
 And it certainly could have deflated the Falcons, who have been troubled by 
internal strife, including the suspension of Andre Rison for a game. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither three interceptions nor the run seemed to bother George, who 
promptly marched the Falcons 67 yards in six plays, capping the drive with a 
seven-yard touchdown pass to Mathis, who finished with 10 receptions for 124 
yards. Then George passed to Mathis again for a two-point conversion that gave 
Atlanta a 21-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "When something like that interception happens, it ticks you off, particularly 
when they come right back with a big play," said George, who completed 26 of 46 
passes but was booed for three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We showed character because we came right back and did what we had to do 
after we looked real ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive tackle Mike Kenn, who broke a Falcon record by playing in his 247th 
consecutive game, said: "We said to ourselves we'd already screwed up enough. 
Let's get it on." 
</P>
<P>
 They did. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time Atlanta got the ball, George took the Falcons 87 yards in 12 
plays, capped by a powerful five-yard run by Craig Heyward. Three completions 
on the drive were to Mathis, who has 90 for the season for 1,073 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia got one score back with 4:22 left on Walker's two-yard run, set 
up by Eric Allen's interception, the third thrown by George. 
</P>
<P>
 But rookie Anthony Phillips intercepted Randall Cunningham on the first play 
after Philadelphia got the ball back with 2:25 to play on its 43. And the 
Eagles couldn't get a play off after Cunningham completed a 61-yard pass to 
Victor Bailey at the Atlanta 19 with 11 seconds and no timeouts left.

A TEAM THAT SPECIALIZES IN MISTAKES; INTERCONFERENCE: BREAKDOWNS ON THE RAMS' 
SPECIAL TEAMS RUIN SCORING CHANCES AGAINST SAN DIEGO.

<P>
 These are the Monday morning film sessions that the Rams' Todd Kinchen and 
David Lang dread, the ones that require an extra ration of earplugs because 
Wayne Sevier turns from a special teams coach into a film critic. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's session should produce a brutal review, after a chain of special-teams 
gaffes cost the Rams momentum, not to mention points, in a 31-17 loss to San 
Diego Sunday at Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be especially tough for Kinchen, who will watch replay after replay of 
his 99-yard kickoff return for a touchdown called back because of a holding 
penalty on the Rams' Thomas Homco. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen, we're all sick of saying, 'almost,' and 'want to' and 'should have' 
and 'could have,' " Kinchen said. "When you work so hard all week in practice 
to execute well, and then in the game you execute well, only to have one 
mistake call it back." 
</P>
<P>
 It will be even tougher for Lang, who shouldered the blame for two costly 
second-half gaffes: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He beat a double-team on punt coverage early in the third quarter, only to 
get suckered by a fake by San Diego return man Darrien Gordon, who sprinted 
past Lang and 10 other Rams for a 75-yard touchdown. That erased a 14-6 Ram 
lead and left Lang kicking the turf in disgust as he walked off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was all my fault and I take full responsibility for it," Lang said. "I 
had that double-team beat, and I was sure Gordon was coming to the inside. He 
sold me on that and went outside. Coach Sevier always teaches us to stay on the 
right and keep him off the sideline. Instead, he ended up on my right shoulder 
and I got blocked." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lang also was called for holding in the fourth quarter, negating Todd 
Lyght's 27-yard punt return off a lateral from Kinchen. The Rams, trailing, 
24-14, at the time, would have gotten the ball at their 48-yard line, but the 
penalty brought it back to the 38. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to get back up and I reached out to grab some grass to pull 
myself up," Lang said. "When I reached out, I got my man by the shoe and he 
went down. That was a big play." 
</P>
<P>
 So was Kinchen's kickoff return, which came on the heels of Gordon's punt 
return for a touchdown. The Chargers had just tied the game, 14-14, on Gordon's 
run, but Kinchen's return suddenly silenced the crowd of 59,579 -- or at least 
until the fans saw the penalty flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinchen, who scored on a 44-yard reverse in a loss to San Francisco last week, 
didn't notice. He was too busy celebrating with his teammates in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the Rams started to line up for the extra point, Kinchen noticed the 
yellow flag 80 yards downfield. Holding on Homco -- and a long walk back to the 
Rams' 10-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must have had 150 yards in returns called back today," Kinchen said. "They 
crushed our momentum with the punt return, and that (penalty) took everything 
out of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Homco pleaded innocent -- sort of -- by saying the holding call 
occurred away from the return and therefore shouldn't have been called. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just devastated," he said. "All I want to do is help the team, and then 
something like this happens. It was a call the officials had to make. My hands 
were on his (coverage man's) head. Our feet got tangled up, and my hands just 
went up. It was unfortunate they called it because it was irrelevant to the 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 Irrelevant but costly, the kind of disappointing play the Rams' special teams 
have made over and over this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven weeks ago, Green Bay's Robert Brooks returned a punt 85 yards for a 
touchdown in the Packers' 24-17 victory over the Rams. Five weeks ago, New 
Orleans' Tyrone Hughes set an NFL record for return yardage and scored twice on 
kick returns in a 37-34 Saint victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Three games full of special teams mistakes. Three losses. The difference 
between 4-8 and 7-5, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a real consistent coverage team," Kinchen said. "We had big plays on 
us every once in a while. But to be great, you have to be consistent week in 
and week out."

COLLEGE HOCKEY; OVERTIME GOAL LIFTS MAINE OVER BOSTON AT FORUM

 Taking advantage of a Boston University mistake in sudden-death overtime, the 
University of Maine defeated the Terriers, 6-5, at the Forum Sunday to claim 
its third Great Western Freeze-Out tournament title in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Black Bears' Dan Shermerhorn scored 2:43 into the extra period after 
Boston defenseman Chris Kelleher lost control of the puck and gave it away in 
front of his own net.Shermerhorn, fore-checking deep in the Terrier zone, 
flipped the puck over diving Boston goaltender Derek Herlofsky. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those kind of things happen in overtime," said Maine Coach Shawn Walsh. "When 
you're playing on ice that hasn't been resurfaced in a while, the rule is to 
keep it simple and don't get fancy with the puck. It was a terrific win, 
especially the way we came back." 
</P>
<P>
 Shermerhorn, who had two goals in the game, got Maine on the board two minutes 
into the second period. Boston answered with goals by Shawn Bates, Chris 
O'Sullivan and Mike Grier. The Black Bears' Brad Purdie and the Terriers' Mike 
Sylvia then traded goals and Boston had a 4-2 lead after 40 minutes of play. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third period, Maine used goals by Wayne Conlan and Tony Frenette to tie 
the game. After the Terriers again took the lead on a goal by Ken Rausch, Black 
Bear defenseman Dave MacIsaac sent the game to overtime when he scored with 
only 24 seconds left in regulation and with Maine goaltender Blair Allison on 
the bench in favor of an extra attacker.

 Marvelous Crown of Japan outran co-favorite Paradise Creek of the United 
States down the stretch Sunday to win the Japan Cup, the world's richest horse 
race, by a nose. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory in front of a crowd of 165,930 at Tokyo Race Course was worth 
$1.74 million from a purse of $4.03 million, increasing Marvelous Crown's 
career earnings to $4.16 million. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 1,301st career victory for jockey Katsumi Minai, who earlier this 
year became Japan's first Triple Crown winner in 10 years. He rode Narita Brian 
to victory in the Satsuki-sho, the Japan Derby and the Kikka-sho. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-year-old Marvelous Crown, a winner in seven of 17 starts, finished 1 1/2 
miles in 2 minutes, 23.6 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's Royce and Royce finished third.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; IN MATRIARCH, NO ONE CAN KEEP UP WITH THE RATE OF EXCHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The richest victory of trainer Bill Spawr's career was also the most 
satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 Enthused by how Exchange trained after her disappointing effort in the 
Breeders' Cup Distaff, Spawr suggested to owners Sid and Jenny Craig that the 
6-year-old Explodent mare be supplemented to the $400,000 Matriarch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Craigs agreed, put up the $20,000, then Exchange went out and verified her 
trainer's confidence Sunday in the Grade I race at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first Matriarch without Flawlessly since 1990 and with Hollywood 
Wildcat also missing, Exchange, a $50,000 claim by her current owners, won for 
the 14th time in 28 starts and surpassed $1 million in career earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 As is her custom, however, it was far from easy. Challenged from all sides in 
the stretch, Exchange withstood everyone and finally beat Aube Indienne by a 
head in 1:49 2/5 for the 1 1/8 miles on the turf. The Canadian-bred mare has 
won half of her starts, but never by much. Her largest margin of victory in her 
last five victories is three-quarters of a length. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite hopping at the start under Laffit Pincay, the 3-1 second choice took 
the early lead inside Zoonaqua, slowed things down on a course that has been 
favoring speed and scored her eighth victory in 12 turf appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the biggest purse I've won, but what makes it satisfying is that I was 
right," said Spawr. "You could just throw out the race in the Breeders' Cup 
(she finished seventh of nine) because she didn't handle the track at all. She 
had done so well since (coming back to California) and she worked (five 
furlongs) in 58 4/5 (on Nov. 21) and that's just not like her. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time she ran on the turf (May 30, 1993) she broke in the air and she 
injured an ankle . . . and she did the same thing again today. It must have 
cost her two or three lengths. I didn't think she was beaten because I know 
her, and with the easy pace, I didn't think they'd beat her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at her this way -- 3-year-olds running against a mare that's been 
second and third to Hollywood Wildcat and Paseana. Maybe Exchange isn't a 
champion, but she's right next to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Exchange will continue to race as a 7-year-old, but she might return to the 
main track because Spawr, like many others, is not a fan of the Santa Anita 
turf course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's a safe course for my kind of mare," he said. "It's like 
running on a sandy field." 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever she goes, Pincay will follow. The two have been constant companions, 
although the start made the world's second-winningest rider a bit anxious. 
</P>
<P>
 "She hopped leaving the gate, the same thing as she did the last time she ran 
over here," he said. "I was a little worried because I thought I was going to 
make an easy lead. I had to rush her a little bit to make lead, then she was 
able to relax. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just tried to save her for the last part. The horse on the outside (Aube 
Indienne) headed me, but my mare responded when I whipped her a few times 
because she wanted to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Aube Indienne fell short of her third consecutive victory and a fourth in a 
row for Whittingham in the Matriarch. She beat Wandesta, the remaining half of 
the Juddmonte Farms entry after the scratch of Skimble earlier in the 
afternoon, by a half-length. 
</P>
<P>
 "The slow pace hurt her, but she's the real thing, that's for sure," said 
Whittingham. "But a slow pace hurts anybody. The other one (Exchange) never 
gives up, you know? You gotta blow by her, but no use crying. She's a tough one 
to get by." 
</P>
<P>
 Alywow, one of the 3-year-old fillies Spawr referred to, stayed close to the 
pace early, then faded to finish seventh as the 2-1 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt very comfortable," said Mike Smith, Alywow's rider. "I know she was 
closer than she's ever been before, but they were just crawling out there. She 
was well within herself. I'm really at a loss to explain what happened."

NCAA WATER POLO; STANFORD HOLDS OFF USC, WINS TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti knew what to bring to the NCAA water polo 
final. 
</P>
<P>
 A change of clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 No winning coach can escape being thrown in the water by his team. And when 
Stanford defeated USC, 14-10, to win the NCAA title Sunday, Dettamanti gladly 
took a bath. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bring them every year," Dettamanti said. "You have to be prepared. The guys 
think it's bad luck, but you have to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 In a season in which Stanford (27-1) was ranked No. 1 from start to finish, 
rarely had Dettamanti's team been tested as it was in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed every time Stanford scored, USC (18-7) answered. But a turning point 
came after a couple of fourth-quarter ejections put USC in too big a hole. 
</P>
<P>
 With about two minutes to play and Stanford leading, 11-9, USC stole the ball 
but possession was returned to Stanford because a foul was called that drew a 
series of complaints from the USC bench. However, with USC playing strong 
defense, it appeared that the Trojans would take possession when the shot clock 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
 But with two seconds left on the shot clock, USC's Ivan Hurtado was ejected 
for fouling Frank Schneider. That gave Stanford a six-on-five advantage and 
brought USC assistant coach Jovan Vavic poolside to complain. He was warned but 
continued to complain and was ejected when he cursed at referee Bret Bernard. 
That gave Stanford a six-on-four advantage, which the Cardinal turned into a 
score and a 12-9 lead.  
</P>
<P>
 USC went for a quick score but missed. Stanford killed any comeback hopes by 
controlling the ball for 51 seconds on a rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 USC and Stanford both had late scores, but for the second consecutive year, 
Stanford won the championship and USC was second. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third-place game, Mike Sparling scored three times for California 
(21-10) in an 8-5 victory over UCLA (17-14). Pepperdine (17-9) won the 
fifth-place game, 13-10, against Navy (26-7), and Air Force (20-10) won, 7-5, 
against Massachusetts (31-8) in the seventh-place game. Water Polo Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford's Jack Bowen, Jeremy Laster and Frank Schneider shared most valuable 
player honors in the tournament. Also on the all-tournament team were 
Stanford's Wolf Wigo, USC's Drew Netherton and Hrvoje Cizmic, California's 
Brent Albright and UCLA's Scott Turner. . . . It is the eighth national 
championship for Stanford.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The UCLA soccer team scored three goals in the last eight minutes to defeat 
Southern Methodist, 4-2, in the second round of the NCAA playoffs Sunday at 
SMU. 
</P>
<P>
 After scoring early, the Bruins found themselves trailing the Mustangs, 2-1, 
with 10 minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (SMU) were up, 2-1, and already looking to milk the clock a little bit," 
said UCLA Coach Sigi Schmid. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're down, 2-1, with 10 minutes to go you're not exactly in a euphoric 
state, but we began to play more aggressively and won the majority of the 
challenges." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins (17-4) got second-half goals from Frankie Hejduk, Greg Vanney and 
Ante Razov. Andy Frye scored their opening goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs (15-4-1) were unable to answer the Bruin rally due in large part 
to goalkeeper Chris Snitko, who had five saves and made a crucial stop to 
protect the lead with 2:14 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA will play host to the College of Charleston (19-6) in the quarterfinals 
next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 CS Fullerton 1, San Francisco 0 -- Mike Tran executed an overhead scissors 
kick that Matt Bradbury headed into the goal, giving the Titans the victory 
before 2,651 at Titan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the kind of shot that you'd say you would give him a million bucks if 
he could do it again, and he never would," said San Francisco Coach Stephen 
Negoesco. "But it was a good goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Tran said it was all reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get lucky sometimes, and in that case I got very lucky," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans (14-6-2) will meet Indiana in the quarterfinals.

 It did not take long for defending champion Arkansas to bounce back from an 
embarrassing opening-game loss, as the Razorbacks routed Georgetown, 97-79, 
Sunday in the first game of the inaugural Martin Luther King Classic 
doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a crowd of 18,245 at The Pyramid, Corliss Williamson scored 22 points 
and grabbed 16 rebounds, and Scotty Thurman and Clint McDaniel added 16 points 
each to lead Arkansas, which lost to Massachusetts, 104-80, Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that we were in trouble as soon as I saw the score of their first 
game," Georgetown Coach John Thompson said. "I was hoping that they would beat 
the heck out of UMass and then we would be able to sneak up on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas (1-1) shot 50% from floor, including 43% from behind the three-point 
line in the first half. Reggie Garrett came off the bench to add 15 points for 
the Razorbacks, who forced Georgetown into 28 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the first game, we were not ready to step up and play," Thurman said. 
"Today, we had a lot of players come in and play with a lot of heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Georgetown (0-1) was led by freshman guard Allen Iverson, who made only five 
of 18 shots but finished with 19 points. George Butler had 17 and Eric Myles 
11. LONNIE WHITE

<P>
 With Charles Barkley once again out of the lineup, Danny Manning scored 10 of 
his 18 points in the fourth quarter to lead the Phoenix Suns past the New 
Jersey Nets, 115-110, Sunday night at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley, who played his first game of the season Saturday night and scored 23 
points in 33 minutes, pulled himself out of the starting lineup because of 
soreness in his abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Anderson's layup capped a 31-12 run and gave New Jersey a 102-101 lead 
with four minutes remaining. But Manning scored five of the Suns' next seven 
points as Phoenix took a 108-104 lead with 2:51 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Majerle and Wesley Person each scored 26 points for Phoenix, but neither 
scored in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Derrick Coleman scored 30 points and pulled down 10 rebounds to lead New 
Jersey, which lost for the seventh time in nine road games. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 106, Golden State 91 -- The Pistons blew a 21-point lead in the third 
quarter at Auburn Hills, Mich., but outscored the Warriors, 32-13, in the 
fourth quarter to extend Golden State's losing streak to four. 
</P>
<P>
 After shooting just 36% in the first half, Golden State made 69% of its shots 
in the third quarter. The streak ended as quickly as it started, however, as 
the Warriors missed seven of 10 free throws in the first 5:30 of the fourth 
quarter and fell behind, 88-83. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit went on its own 24-5 run and led, 98-83, with about four minutes to 
play. Grant Hill and Joe Dumars each scored 21 points to lead the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 94, Sacramento 89 -- Karl Malone scored 25 points, including four free 
throws in the final 3:34 at Sacramento to help the Jazz win their fourth 
consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch Richmond scored 25 for the Kings, who led throughout the game until 
Bryon Russell's three-point basket with 7:54 left in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland 99, Indiana 89 -- Clyde Drexler, who had only six points after three 
quarters, scored nine points in the fourth quarter at Portland to help the 
Trail Blazers snap the Pacers' four-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacers, who had 23 turnovers, attempted a team record low of 59 field 
goals. It was the fewest number of shots by a Portland opponent.

JACK SMITH: AFTER THE FALL, STRING BEANS AND CHAMPAGNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was quite a commotion at our house the other day. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to reach something on the end table beside my bed, I slid off and 
bounced on the floor, knocking over a soup bowl, a glass of water and a plate 
of lunch leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of my instability I am supposed to wear an alarm cord around my neck. 
It has buttons for 911, police, fire department, a neighbor and nearby 
relatives. However, I often neglect to put it on when my wife leaves me alone. 
I'm afraid I will set it off accidentally. 
</P>
<P>
 One day a few weeks ago, I evidently pushed some of the buttons by accident 
just before my wife and I left the house together. When we got home our 
daughter-in-law Jackie was still there -- the last of several visitors who had 
responded to the alarm, including a fire truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, I am not eager to repeat that embarrassment. So when I found 
myself sprawled on the floor beside my bed, the alarm button was on my dresser, 
several feet away. I wasn't worried. I thought I could easily get to my knees 
and then to my feet. But my right leg is disabled by a stroke and my broken 
left wrist is in a cast, and the arm is useless. I struggled and struggled but 
couldn't get up, not even to crawl. 
</P>
<P>
 The television was on, but it was a junk program and I couldn't turn it off. I 
didn't expect my wife home for two or three hours. I couldn't bear the thought 
of lying on my haunches for two or three hours watching junk TV. 
</P>
<P>
 The telephone had been knocked off the table and lay on the floor in two 
pieces. I managed to reach it and put it back together and got a dial tone. 
Salvation. 
</P>
<P>
 I hated to do it but I decided to call my son Doug. My granddaughter Adriana 
answered the phone. Doug wasn't home. I described my plight, emphasizing that I 
wasn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 She said, "I'll be right over. I'm leaving right now." She lives in Linda 
Vista, about 20 minutes away. I lay on the floor like an overturned beetle, 
awaiting deliverance. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later the phone rang. I answered. It was the fire department. 
The fireman asked me if I was Jack Smith at my address. I said "Yes," and he 
said, "We'll be there in a few minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 I yelled, "Use the back door!" and lay back wondering, "What hath God 
wrought?" 
</P>
<P>
 Several minutes later I heard a commotion at the back door and my 
granddaughter and three paramedics burst in simultaneously. One of them gave me 
a hand and raised me to my feet. I thanked him and he said, "We'll just take 
some Playboys." 
</P>
<P>
 He was referring to a column I wrote a month or two ago after the county had 
barred the magazine from all fire stations. I had a large hoard of old Playboys 
and offered them to any firemen who applied. I told him where I kept them and 
said, "Take all you want." 
</P>
<P>
 "No thanks," he said. "Just kidding." 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out my grandson Chris, recently discharged from the Army and now 
employed as a security officer, had called 911, which alerted the paramedics. 
My grandson goes by the book in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie soon arrived on the scene, saying she was going to make my dinner. 
Meanwhile my wife had called and been informed of developments. She said that 
she was going to pick up something for my dinner, evidently feeling guilty for 
leaving me alone. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jackie was not to be discouraged. She drove down to the market and came 
back with what she called "beautiful" string beans and broccoli, both of which 
I hate. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie then went foraging and found a bottle of un-iced champagne in the bar 
and we agreed that we ought to toast the fact that I was uninjured, even if the 
champagne was warm. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife came home while we were drinking the champagne and we had to give her 
a glass, which she did not decline. 
</P>
<P>
 At least it wasn't as bad as the last time, when I accidentally set off the 
alarm. On that occasion one of the calls went to the office of my older son, 
Curt, who was not in. His assistant, not knowing what else to do, looked up 
Curt's relatives and called the first name. It happened to be a niece of mine 
who lives out of town. She was panicked but she didn't have the slightest idea 
what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife got home in time to make me a vodka tonic fix. I needed it. She had 
brought me a dinner of pasta and string beans.

THE LAST REFUGE; GROUP HOMES PROVIDE SECURITY BUT LITTLE ELSE FOR ABUSED TEENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a framed poster board in her bedroom at the Olive Crest home for abused 
children, 15-year-old Laura has a collage of photos filled with the smiling 
faces of friends, pet animals and familiar places. 
</P>
<P>
 Conspicuously absent are any images of adults, particularly the father who 
abused her from an early age and the mother who kept silent about it. 
</P>
<P>
 The courts took her away from her parents, and the Orange County social 
services system put her in a private group home with five other teen-age girls. 
There, Laura probably will live without parental guidance and love until she 
becomes an adult in three years and must leave. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't a warm domestic scene from Ozzie and Harriet, but then, "Ozzie and 
Harriet couldn't handle the problems these kids have," said Gene Howard, 
director of children's services for the Orange County Social Service Agency. 
"Ozzie and Harriet wouldn't last two minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Group homes are the last refuge for a teen-age ward of the court. Because most 
foster parents prefer younger children, as teen-agers grow older, their chances 
of finding a foster home shrink. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the largest group home providers in Orange County, Olive Crest's 
goal is to provide familylike security and a stable environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucked into residential neighborhoods like any other home on the block, Olive 
Crest's 13 group homes in the county have the look of suburbia. But it's not a 
normal life. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet, 15, goes to a regular public school, "but when a van has to pick you up 
after school, the other kids want to know about it," she said. "It's like, 'Why 
do you go home in a van every day?' " 
</P>
<P>
 There is a roof over her head, but constant bed checks at night. Three square 
meals and career guidance are provided, but so are strict limits on dating. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, this isn't a normal life at all," said Debbi Romero, an Olive Crest case 
worker. "We try to provide security and structure. . . . We don't try to fill a 
parental role. Most of these kids have good reason not to trust their parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Their backgrounds are always ugly, sometimes horrifying. Nearly all of them 
have been bitten, beaten or raped by their parents or other relatives -- some 
even having to testify against a mother or father in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst thing is the guilt they are made to feel," said Romero. "The 
thought that 'I broke the family up.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The children living in group homes are referred by the county Social Services 
Agency, which is charged with finding shelter for children after the courts 
take them from abusive parents. 
</P>
<P>
 But finding a home, even a group home, can be a problem. With limited space 
available, the county often sends children to group homes in other counties. 
And in Orange County last year, there were more than 32,000 reported cases of 
child abuse and 300 to 500 teen-age wards in group homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a crying need for group home beds," said Howard. "We'd like to place 
them within the Orange County community, but sometimes we can't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The high cost of housing in the county and "not in my back yard" attitudes 
toward group homes are the main hurdles faced by county social service workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need residences (for group homes) and those cost a lot more here," said 
Howard. "And quite frankly, it's also a situation where people don't want these 
kids in their neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is a shame, Howard said, because a recent county study shows that 
"children coming to us are more emotionally disturbed than ever before and are 
more in need than ever before." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Therapy is a large part of the Olive Crest program. Once a week, the whole 
group sits down with a psychologist. Most children also have individual 
sessions with a psychiatrist or therapist. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic Olive Crest group home shelters six teen-agers. Six workers watch 
over the youths in shifts, transporting them to and from school, cooking and 
performing bed checks at night. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit group is one of about 20 organizations that offer group home 
care. Like most, Olive Crest's main income comes from state Aid For Dependent 
Children funds. 
</P>

 At Olive Crest, a tutor comes in after school to help with homework. The teens 
are allowed part- time jobs and given $30 per month spending money. They can go 
out with members of the opposite sex, but dates must first visit the home at 
least three times. Privileges, such as telephone use, are granted for good 
behavior and taken away when shelter rules are broken.

<P>
 "It's a structured environment," Romero said. "They don't like it sometimes, 
but it's necessary for their well-being." 
</P>
<P>
 However, group home kids usually hate authority and the loss of privacy. The 
workers who watch over them are perceived as little more than jailers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every group home has different expectations for you," said 15-year-old 
Rachel, sitting on a couch with two other teen-age residents. "You're very 
pressured to conform." 
</P>
<P>
 Rachel laughs at the idea of case workers as parental role models. Are her 
house mates more like family? Rachel thinks for a moment, replies: "They're not 
like sisters. More like friends. We all stick up for each other, anyhow."

 Kris, 15, a former runaway, said, "I'd rather live on the streets. You can't 
trust anyone here. . . . They say one thing and do something else." 
</P>
<P>
 The girls sneer at the suggestion that they are permitted to date, within 
limits: "I don't date," Janet said. "I'm not allowed." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Romero, who attended the interview, smiled and commented "that was 
pretty mild. You should see them when they're really angry." 
</P>
<P>
 Stella Avina, a program administrator with the Adam Walsh Center, said anger 
is present in nearly all abused teens. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easier on the young ones," she said. "When they get to the teen-age 
years, it's really to tough to get through to them. When they have that anger 
inside, they don't believe in anyone or anything." Olive Crest Foundation

CASE TRIGGERS AN OUTCRY FROM ASIAN ACTIVISTS; CRIME: VIETNAMESE MAN CHARGED 
WITH MURDER WHEN FRIEND IS KILLED BY GUARD IN ALLEGED ROBBERY GAINS SUPPORTERS, 
WHO SAY AUTHORITIES MISPERCEIVED HIM AS A GANG MEMBER.

<P>
 The future looked bright for Tu Anh Tran that night in April when he and a 
neighbor went out for an evening of billiards, beer and an after-hours bite at 
a Westminster restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran, 22, was just a few months away from getting his associate of arts degree 
at Rancho Santiago College and making plans to attend the University of Iowa -- 
not far from his father's home in Des Moines and a big step closer to Tran's 
dream of one day becoming a soccer coach. 
</P>
<P>
 But the late-night outing took a deadly turn. A table-spilling fracas ended 
when an off-duty security guard fatally shot the neighbor and wounded Tran -- 
both of whom, police say, were part of a group that demanded the guard's pistol 
and then beat him with a tire iron and sprayed him with Mace until the guard 
opened fire in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Tran, who denies joining the fight and who never fired a shot, faces a 
possible life sentence for the friend's murder because of his alleged role in 
the beating. The case has threatened Tran's once-soaring hopes and become a 
cause celebre among some Asian American activists, who contend that he is being 
railroaded by authorities who misperceived him as a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 The case features uncommon legal issues -- centering on when a suspect is 
liable for the death of an alleged accomplice -- and ironies aplenty. Among 
Tran's backers during a recent demonstration was the mother of the slain 
neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a frightening case," said Tran's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Jeff 
Lund. "You have a man who was not directly responsible for the death of his 
friend -- who we believe was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
 Tran is accused of the murder of his friend and attempted murder and robbery 
of the security guard, who was not charged in connection with the April 2 
shooting at the Pho Tien Canh restaurant. Tran's alleged weapon was a canister 
of Mace that police said was stripped from the guard during the melee and used 
to spray him as five to 10 men pummeled him. The incident came amid a string of 
headline-making shootings at local Vietnamese cafes and eateries. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors declined to discuss details of the Tran case, which is scheduled 
for trial Dec. 5 at Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though the case is being tried by gang specialists in the Orange County 
district attorney's office, prosecutors denied labeling Tran a gang member and 
stood by their decision to try him under a provision that allows a suspect to 
be charged with murder when a "provocative act" results in deadly force and 
death. The theory has been used to prosecute murders ranging from fatal robbery 
attempts to gang shootouts, including one last year in Orange that killed a 
15-year-old bystander. 
</P>
<P>
 The night of the Westminster incident began amiably. Tran invited his 
neighbor, a reclusive 37-year-old machinist named Kinh Van Chu, to join him for 
some pool. The two later stopped at a nightclub for beers and then ducked into 
Pho Tien Canh for soup about 2 a.m., Tran said in a jailhouse interview. They 
joined a table of men who had been at the same pool hall earlier, Tran said. 
</P>
<P>
 The off-duty guard, Narin S. Thong, 26, was eating with another group at a 
table nearby. After Thong got up to pay, witnesses said, he was confronted by 
Chu and others who demanded his gun, then beat him with a tire iron and a 
three-foot metal rod. Police said Thong fell to the floor and dropped his 
10-millimeter pistol. Tran sprayed Mace into Thong's face, according to a 
restaurant worker who testified at a preliminary hearing in August. 
</P>
<P>
 But the guard managed to fight off the crowd and recover his pistol, police 
said, then opened fire. Two people were hit. Chu was struck once in the hand 
and once fatally in abdomen. Tran was shot once in the back and taken by 
bystanders to a nearby hospital, where police later tracked him down. 
</P>
<P>
 His attorney acknowledged that Tran initially gave police a false name and 
misled them about where the shooting took place but said it was because he 
feared gang reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the fracas is disputed. Police said Thong, who wore street 
clothes but was carrying his gun and Mace underneath a jacket, was being 
robbed. Thong told police he believed gang members in the group wanted to kill 
him in retaliation for kicking gang members out of the Stanton billiard hall 
where he worked, according to a police report. 
</P>
<P>
 Thong was licensed to carry a gun as a security guard but did not have a 
permit to carry a concealed weapon, according to records and testimony. Last 
year, he fatally shot a suspected robber while on duty at a Long Beach club in 
an incident police ruled a justifiable shooting, according to Long Beach 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran said the incident at the restaurant began as "chitchat" between Thong and 
Chu. Tran said he had gotten up to pay his bill at the restaurant and does not 
know how it escalated into a full-blown fight, with Chu issuing an apparent 
challenge: "So, you think you're so tough!" 
</P>
<P>
 Tran said he rushed over to break up the fight and was shot in the struggle. 
He said he never touched the Mace canister, which was not recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder case has mobilized members of Orange County's Vietnamese immigrant 
community and stoked the efforts of a civil rights group that in the past has 
criticized the police practice of photographing suspected gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alliance Working for Asian Rights and Empowerment (AWARE) has organized 
demonstrations outside the courthouse in support of Tran, charging that 
authorities have pursued the case because they suspect him of being a gang 
member. His supporters say police may have misinterpreted tattoos meant to 
memorialize Tran's late mother and self-inflicted cigarette burns following her 
death in Vietnam almost six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never in a gang and never, ever knew anyone in a gang," Tran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran wrote to one of AWARE's members from jail after reading the memoirs of 
her family's flight from Vietnam in the 1980s. Convinced that Tran was wrongly 
accused, members of the year-old group quickly took up his cause, visiting him 
in jail and steering media attention to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people are just concerned that people are being mislabeled. That's the 
fear," said co-founder Daniel C. Tsang, a political science instructor at UC 
Irvine. "It seems to me he would not have been charged with the crime if police 
had not assumed he was a gang member. . . . We're worried a whole generation of 
Asian youth are being mislabeled." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robin Park declined to comment on most aspects of the case, 
including its handling as a gang crime. But she noted that prosecutors have not 
named Tran as a gang member and did not attach specific gang allegations to the 
charges already against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Park urged critics to wait for the trial before drawing conclusions. "I can 
understand how difficult it is for people outside of the system and the case," 
she said. "They really should refrain." 
</P>
<P>
 Tran has no criminal record but is facing a 1993 misdemeanor charge of 
resisting a law enforcement official, according to court records. No further 
information on the incident was available. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives and friends portray Tran as a quiet, hard-working student who picked 
up English quickly after emigrating from Vietnam with his father, two sisters 
and younger brother. A month after resettling in Iowa in 1988, they received 
news that Tran's mother, who stayed behind, was killed in a car accident. 
Following Vietnamese custom, Tran branded his love for his mother on his 
shoulder with the image of an eagle and the words, "A bird without its flock." 
</P>
<P>
 Tran later attended high school in Denver, staying with a family friend while 
his father juggled work and night classes to complete his college degree. The 
younger Tran aspired to become a soccer coach and chose junior college in 
California, where the sport seemed more popular. 
</P>
<P>
 He shared a Garden Grove home with Chu's cousin, whom he had met in a 
Philippines refugee center while awaiting immigration to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's such an innocent guy. He's kind of like my older brother," said roommate 
Quan Do, 20, who car-pooled with Tran to Rancho Santiago College in Santa Ana 
and spent weekends with him playing soccer and pool. "He rarely got mad. And if 
he did, he wouldn't say anything and would just go to his room." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before the shooting, Tran was on the verge of completing his degree and 
planning to transfer to the University of Iowa, where he could be nearer to his 
family and away from California's crime, said his father, Thanh Van Tran. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was ready to come home," he said. "He wasn't very happy in California 
because the living conditions were turbulent. The crime and violence turned him 
off. He was getting homesick too." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts said the sparely used provocative-act theory behind the prosecution 
may be more difficult to prove than conventional charges because prosecutors 
must show that Tran, though not directly responsible for the killing, was 
nonetheless involved a crime he knew could result in deadly force. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those looking on when the trial begins will be the parents of the late 
Kinh Van Chu, who are contemplating a civil lawsuit but haven't decided against 
whom. 
</P>
<P>
 Chu's mother, Hoi Mong Do, recently visited Tran in jail and said she does not 
blame him for the death of her oldest son. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was just an unfortunate night," she said. "It was bad luck."

TINY ST. MATTHEW RATTLES THE ROMAN CATHOLIC DIOCESE; RELIGION: AMERICAN 
CATHOLIC CHURCH IN ORANGE TARGETS THE DISENFRANCHISED, SPURRING COMPLAINTS OF 
DECEPTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The local newspaper advertisements aim at divorced Roman Catholics who, 
because they were once married, are barred from remarrying in their church. 
</P>
<P>
 "Want a Catholic Wedding but Cannot Be Married in Your Roman Catholic Parish? 
Call the Priests of St. Matthew Church. An American Catholic Community." 
</P>
<P>
 Such marketing has lured a booming wedding business to St. Matthew, a tiny 
church in Orange, where priests say they officiate at about 300 marriages a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But St. Matthew's advertising, which targets "unhappy or disenfranchised Roman 
Catholics," its founding pastor says, has spurred an ongoing feud with the 
Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Msgr. Lawrence J. Baird, the diocesan spokesman, contends that the priests at 
St. Matthew are trying to deceive Roman Catholics that theirs is a Roman 
Catholic church when it is not. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Matthew's designation as a Catholic Church, albeit American rather than 
Roman Catholic, in itself is confusing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clear that St. Matthew is being disingenuous in regard to appealing to 
Roman Catholics," Baird said. "The issue is deceptive advertising." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of complaints from some Roman Catholics who were misled, Baird said, 
the official diocesan newsletter last year ran a warning that marriage 
attempted before priests or deacons of St. Matthew would be invalid in the eyes 
of the Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Baird said that, at the urging of the diocese, most Roman Catholic parishes in 
Orange County over the past 12 months have placed similar alerts in the 
bulletins they distribute at Sunday Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 The diocese has angered Father Peter E. Hickman, founder of St. Matthew, who 
said the accusations falsely impugn the reputation of his church. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a campaign to discredit St. Matthew," he complained. It worries 
him, he said, because "the Roman Catholic Church is a moral force that carries 
a big punch." Hickman said he was insulted by a letter that a Roman Catholic 
priest in Riverside sent in September to the parents of a prospective bride, in 
which the priest refused to forward her baptismal certificate to St. Matthew in 
preparation for the marriage. In the letter, the priest alleged those running 
St. Matthew were "posing" as Roman Catholic priests. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickman, whose 400-member congregation meets in a converted office building 
close to the Orange Freeway, said he is eager for the church to grow. He 
attributed his missionary zeal in part to his training as a Southern Baptist 
minister before his conversion to Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
 He is recruiting Roman Catholics who, because of divorce and remarriage or the 
practice of artificial birth control, are no longer welcome to receive the 
sacraments in the church of their youth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His congregation, Hickman said, consists largely of baby boomers between 30 
and 50 for whom St. Matthew's Mass and sacraments offer comfortable 
familiarity. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Troianello, 44, of north Tustin, said she had been brought up Catholic 
but after finishing parochial school and leaving home only went to church when 
her mother would visit her. 
</P>
<P>
 She sought Hickman six years ago when she wanted to marry a divorced man. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really for my mother so she wouldn't be disappointed," Troianello 
said. The couple also decided it would be "beyond hypocrisy" to apply to the 
Roman Catholic church to have his former marriage annulled, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Troianellos said "Father Peter," as his parishioners call him, never 
claimed that St. Matthew was Roman Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickman said he tells newcomers that St. Matthew is part of the "Old Catholic 
Movement," which broke off from Roman Catholicism more than a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A brochure describing St. Matthew says that, unlike a Roman Catholic church, 
it does not accept the teaching of Papal infallibility. Among other 
differences, its priests may marry, divorced parishioners may remarry without 
having their former marriages annulled, and the use of artificial contraception 
is not prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
 But Old Catholicism's similarity to Roman Catholicism also makes it attractive 
to fallen-away Roman Catholics, Hickman said. Most importantly, he said, the 
ordination of Old Catholic priests, like the ordination of Roman Catholic 
priests, can be traced in unbroken succession to the Apostles. Moreover, he 
said, some Old Catholic priests, including two at St. Matthew, were ordained in 
the Roman Catholic Church but left to marry. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Gregory Coiro, director of public affairs for the Roman Catholic 
Archdiocese of Los Angeles, acknowledged that because the "apostolic 
succession" has been preserved in some Old Catholic Churches, the Roman 
Catholic religion would consider their sacraments, such as holy communion and 
penance, to be "valid" in those churches. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added it would be "sinful" for a Roman Catholic to knowingly attend a 
church separated from Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Coiro said Roman Catholics may receive sacraments from an Old Catholic priest 
only in an emergency, such as a last confession when no Roman Catholic priest 
is available. 
</P>
<P>
 Msgr. Daniel Brennan, judicial vicar at the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange, 
added that special church laws governing marriage stipulate that no clergy but 
the priests of the couple's parish may perform a marriage for Roman Catholics 
unless the bishop approves. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickman complained, "The Roman Catholic Church seeks to tightly control the 
lives of its members. By providing an alternative, we are undermining their 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Callahan, a bishop in the Old Catholic Church who oversees St. 
Matthew, said he believes an "economic issue" lies at the heart of the diocesan 
warnings: concern about the prospect of losing income that churches obtain from 
marriages and other sacraments. 
</P>
<P>
 Callahan said there are about 20 churches with Old Catholic roots in Southern 
California, of which St. Matthew is one of the largest and most active. He said 
less active churches with "Catholic" in their name have avoided the attention 
of the Roman Catholic hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 One such church, St. Francis-by-the-Sea American Catholic Church, has operated 
quietly in Laguna Beach since 1933. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not heard anything from the Diocese of Orange," said Bishop Simon 
Eugene Talarczyk. He said the church has done very little advertising and 
performs weddings "by way of referral." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles said they became 
aware of another church in the Old Catholic tradition, St. Augustine Old Roman 
Catholic Church in East Los Angeles, after news last summer about a scandal 
involving a priest there. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda Anaya-Eckdahl, public affairs officer for the archdiocese, said when 
stories about the priest's conviction for child molestation stated he was not 
Roman Catholic, the archdiocese was flooded with calls from St. Augustine 
parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
 She said St. Augustine "had been appealing to newly arrived immigrants, and 
they thought they were receiving sacraments from the Roman Catholic Church." 
The pastor of St. Augustine, however, contends he tells all his members that 
the church "is not under the jurisdiction of the Pope." 
</P>
<P>
 Baird, the Roman Catholic diocesan spokesman, said his church is simply trying 
to prevent its own members from being misguided, to exert a form of "quality 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested that in Orange County, St. Matthew should reach out to the 
"unchurched" people and leave Roman Catholics alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very concerned about lapsed Catholics, and both priests and lay people 
in the parishes have really been trying to do whatever they can to bring people 
back," Baird said. "There are heroic people living happy lives as Roman 
Catholics, and we don't need St. Matthew to assist with the evangelization of 
those born Roman Catholic." Catholic Differences 
</P>
<P>
 St. Matthew Old Catholic Mission Church in Orange follows the Old Catholic 
Movement, started more than a century ago, and has marked differences from 
Roman Catholic teachings.

STUDENTS PUT MESSAGES INTO MENORAHS; HANUKKAH: RABBI MAKES CREATION OF 
RELIGIOUS SYMBOL LESSON IN JEWISH LAW, AS WELL AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BOYS TO 
CONVEY PERSONAL FEELINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the first day of Hanukkah, an international class of 11 students from the 
Emek Hebrew Academy gathered a few hours before Sunday's sunset to light for 
the first time their handcrafted menorahs -- the products of simultaneous 
lessons in woodworking and Jewish law. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the tutelage of Rabbi Eleazar Eidlitz, the students at the oldest Hebrew 
academy in the San Fernando Valley had spent the past week putting the 
finishing touches on their menorahs, some of which were designed to carry 
political and personal messages. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve-year-old Pejman Behboudikha, who grew up in Iran, attached an inert 
World War II hand grenade and two machine gun bullets to his menorah as a plea 
for world peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "It represents (a hope) that they will stop the wars all over the world," 
Pejman said. "It's my idea of peace." 
</P>
<P>
 After removing the grenade from the menorah's pedestal and displaying its 
empty innards, Pejman explained that Eidlitz had bought it for him at an army 
surplus store. He said the gold chain that spanned the eight arms of his 
menorah was merely for decoration. 
</P>
<P>
 Akiva Greenfield said he also hoped to send a message of worldwide brotherhood 
with his menorah, which was shaped like a peace symbol and had the word shalom, 
or "peace," engraved in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathan Kostant said the beautiful black-and-white marbled finish of his 
menorah was a statement of racial harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 Other boys placed the names of family members on each of the eight branches of 
the menorah, a sign of the importance of family in Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanukkah is an eight-day festival that commemorates the retaking of the Jewish 
temple in Jerusalem in 165 B.C. The lighting of the eight candles of the 
menorah, one for each day of Hanukkah, harks back to the story of the 
Maccabees, who were able to keep their lamps lighted during the rededication of 
the temple for eight days even though they had only enough oil for one. 
</P>
<P>
 The center space on the menorah is reserved for the "shamash," a candle used 
to light the other candles or for such utilitarian purposes as reading and 
lighting one's way in a dark room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember that you are part of a tradition that has a nonstop link from more 
than 2,100 years ago," Eidlitz told his students before they lighted their 
candles. "You directly represent that link that has not been broken. The 
Hashmonean (the Maccabees) were not allowed to practice or study their 
religion, and we have that as we have students from Russia now whose parents 
have had the same experience." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hanukkah ritual is shared by Jewish families worldwide. That sense of 
community was evident among the students, who worked side by side in class to 
construct their menorahs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has made a menorah and everyone was helping each other," said 
Gregory Kalmanovich, from Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan. "The menorahs just 
weren't made by one person." 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Moore watched proudly as his son, Jason, stood behind his menorah. He said 
he was inspired by Eidlitz to make his own menorah when he was 18 at a 
rabbinical school in the Bay Area. He still has the menorah and said he planned 
to light it Sunday night with his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "The magic of Rabbi Eidlitz is really his ability to teach the boys so that 
they not only learn the laws of how to properly build a menorah so that it's 
kosher, but they also learn to work together as a team," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the menorahs were lighted and the boys chanted a traditional prayer, 
Eidlitz gave them some parting wisdom to help them deal with the gifts they 
would be receiving as part of the traditional celebration of Hanukkah. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish you a great deal of success in the loot you will collect from your 
parents," he said, "but I hope that you will remember the Torah connection."

NEVER TOO LATE FOR A NEW BEAT; POLICE: AT 59, LAID-OFF AEROSPACE WORKER FINDS 
HIS SECOND WIND AS LAPD'S OLDEST ROOKIE OFFICER EVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By age 59, most people are looking forward to retirement, to a time when they 
can reap the benefits of their life's work and reflect on the strange twists 
and turns along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 But at 59, rookie Police Officer Edward Olivares has caught a second wind and 
is looking forward to the strange twists and turns that still lie ahead. On 
Sunday, he took the first step of his second career as the Los Angeles Police 
Department's oldest rookie ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out that LAPD was hiring and that my age was not a barrier, and I 
said to myself, 'This is something that I can be proud of for the rest of my 
life,' " Olivares said Sunday as he lifted weights before his first patrol in 
the Foothill Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivares' new career is possible because of a 1992 decision by the Los Angeles 
Police Commission to abolish the department's upper age limit of 34 for new 
recruits. The change was made to comply with federal anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
 His graduation last week from the Police Academy was the culmination of two 
years of physical training to transform himself from a short, fat, laid-off 
defense worker to what he calls a "lean machine." 
</P>
<P>
 Since he left aerospace in December, 1990, Olivares has shed 65 pounds of fat, 
replacing at least part of it with 20 pounds of muscle. He now weighs 175 
pounds. In between, the West Point graduate finished a cooking course at the 
famed Cordon Bleu cooking school in Paris, but found chef jobs even scarcer 
than positions in aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
 His workout Sunday was overrun by reporters, cameramen and even a few fellow 
officers who stopped by just to watch the media spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
 After he was laid off from his job as a project leader, Olivares began working 
out. Starting slowly, he built up his endurance until his daily workout 
included running five miles, swimming 20 laps in a 30-foot pool at his 
Calabasas condo and lifting weights for 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivares is careful to point out that he is not a power lifter, that he trains 
more for endurance and conditioning than the abdominal cuts and physiques 
developed by gym rats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm way past the time of being Mr. Universe," he conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 To some of his fellow officers, though, Olivares' transformation from fat to 
fit and his drive to survive the academy are nothing short of a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just watched him up in the weight room and it was impressive," said 23-year 
veteran Sgt. Al Yarbrough, the day watch commander at the station. "People are 
kind of in awe of this guy because we went through the academy in our 20s, and 
it was tough." 
</P>
<P>
 It was tough for Olivares too. He failed the self-defense skills test and a 
hearing test the first time around, but passed both on his second try. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to make it," he said. "There was never a time when I felt like 
quitting." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, in the first few weeks of his 28-week academy training, Olivares told 
his classmates that no one could quit until he did. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest obstacles to becoming a police officer at his age was his 
wife, Barbara. Not that she wanted to stand in the way of his dream, but she 
was concerned for his safety in the job -- particularly after the death of 
Christy Lynne Hamilton, the 45-year-old rookie who was shot and killed on duty 
last February. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivares said his wife acquiesced when he explained that the statistical odds 
of dying in a freeway crash were higher than being killed as a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three weeks, Olivares has ridden along with veteran officers to 
get a feel for the streets. Once, he drew his weapon, but only in a backup 
role. 
</P>
<P>
 On another ride-along, he and his partner responded to a domestic violence 
call where the house was on a hill, away from other structures. Aware of the 
problems that come with approaching an isolated structure without cover or 
backup, the officers clung to a brick wall as they approached the house. His 
partner then made a 30-yard dash to a nearby tree while Olivares served as 
lookout. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turned out to be a non-event," he said. "The wife was the only one home." 
</P>
<P>
 As in the other aspects of his life, Olivares said he plans to move up quickly 
in the ranks of the Police Department. Even as he anticipated his first day on 
patrol, he acknowledged that his days on the streets are numbered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't expect to be on patrol in the streets for that long," Olivares said. 
"I want to try to get into detectives as soon as the department allows. I want 
to use my analytical and report-writing capabilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Others think he will succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the guy should get a fair shot," Yarbrough said of the rookie's 
ambitions. "Probably about one-third of the people who make detective or 
sergeant have only four or five years on the job. It's a reasonable 
expectation."

PUTTING ON THE WAR PAINT; MOCK SOLDIERS PLAY OUT AGGRESSIONS, MAKE A MESS IN 
MAKE-BELIEVE MANHUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He was a 12-year-old predator, a lean, short-legged war machine with his 
store-bought camouflage jumpsuit and semiautomatic rifle, muddy helmet in hand 
as he coolly surveyed the silent woods above. 
</P>
<P>
 His boys called him Suicide Mike. 
</P>
<P>
 He's the man, they said. He's the vicious runt of the litter, a miniature 
Rambo. On the field of battle, the kid was a force to be reckoned with. 
</P>
<P>
 Suicide Mike sighed, explaining why he was the meanest little marauder this 
side of the Antelope Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like shooting the hell out of people," he said. "It's why I live. Pogs are 
dead. Now the thing to do is fight wars." 
</P>
<P>
 On Michael Daclan's 12th birthday, a dozen of his closest friends across the 
San Fernando Valley devised a suitably manic way to celebrate: Run around some 
wooded slopes in full military gear -- hooting and hollering like wild men, 
firing automatic weapons, maiming, wounding, killing and being killed. 
</P>
<P>
 At least temporarily, in a paintball war. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturdays and Sundays -- and all days in between -- they come, the wacked-out 
Weekend Warriors, middle-aged Marines and wanna-be war heroes, flocking to 
places like Close Encounters, near the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeway 
intersection, doing something most red-blooded American workers only dream of: 
getting a little macho aggression out of their system. 
</P>
<P>
 But these are not Natural Born Killers. They're yuppies and their children 
looking for a woodsy weekend thrill beyond the reach of the suburbs. They're 
married couples, mothers and sons, brothers and sisters. Robert Shapiro, lead 
defense attorney in the O. J. Simpson murder trial, recently brought his 
teen-age son to Close Encounters for an apparent break from the stresses of the 
courtroom drama, said owner Mike Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
 Out here, armed with weapons that fire not bullets, but small, hollow balls 
that explode on contact into a messy glob of nontoxic, biodegradable, 
food-based paint, players stalk the woods like guerrilla warriors in half-hour 
games that many say provide the adrenaline rush of real battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had cops and Marines and every other kind of soldier you can think of," 
Schwartz said. "They all agree this is close to the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out here in the woods, you can enjoy the ultimate thrill of hunting down 
another human being. And at the end of the day, everyone shakes hands and goes 
home. Nobody gets hurt. Nobody gets killed, not even animals." 
</P>
<P>
 Paintball players form two teams, each of which battles to capture the enemy 
team's flag. They describe the sport as a combination of dodge ball, tag, hide 
and seek and kick the can -- with the addition of paint pellets zinging through 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
 And although they aren't lead bullets, the paintballs nonetheless pack a 
sting. Veteran players, many carrying the scars of battle, liken the sensation 
to being hit with a sharp rock or stick, or being slapped hard on a sunburned 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 Said one player: "Getting hit in the neck is the worst. It's like reeling out 
your fishing pole and having the hook catch you in the back of the neck. Some 
guys are sicko. They juice up their guns so the pellets hit harder, cause you 
more pain. And those things can hurt, man." 
</P>
<P>
 Paintball wars have been around for several years, born of a decades-old 
practice among East Coast farmers and railroad men of marking boundaries by 
firing paint pellets at trees and telephone poles. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day, as the story goes," Schwartz said, "these two ol' boys turned the 
paint guns on each other as a joke. One guy shot the other in the butt and they 
decided to hunt each other. And suddenly, a new sport was born." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, battlefield owners like Schwartz say, there are more than half a 
million paintball players nationwide, waging battle on about 500 playing 
fields. Southern California is dotted with a dozen or so fields. Hundreds 
gather at Close Encounters each weekend and companies rent the playing field 
for private games during the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz is a 44-year-old former Navy airplane mechanic who saw non-combat 
duty during the Vietnam War, sometimes marching in uniform alongside ant-war 
protesters, he said. Years later, a friend turned him on to a new sport he 
called the perfect combination of war and peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the mid-1980s, though, paintball was still an underground sport played 
on "bootleg bandit fields" whose location, like those of "rave" parties, would 
not be made known until the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
 So Schwartz went along and played a game of paintball. It changed his life. 
</P>
<P>
 In his very first skirmish, Schwartz was posted along a trail, waiting for 
enemies to come along so he could shoot them in the back. "I was so nervous I 
could hear my own heart beating. And so I crouched there, worrying, 'Could 
anyone else hear it?' Then I heard someone coming, listened to the crunching of 
twigs getting closer and closer and closer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally, I couldn't stand it any longer. I popped up and shot one of my own 
guys in the chest at point-blank range. To say the least, I was hooked." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz joined a touring group that staged tournaments to promote the sport. 
He taught Marines at Camp Pendleton to use the game in training, and coached 
Boy Scouts, church and youth groups to use it to work out their aggressions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have this inherent hunting instinct," he said. "Because of advancing 
technology, we no longer have to hunt and kill to survive. But we still need to 
unleash those survival instincts. These players aren't gun-crazed killers. But 
when they come out here, their eyes glaze over. They enter into another world." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz says the game's popularity increased following the Persian Gulf War. 
"It used to be, you wore a pair of fatigues and nobody wanted to look at you," 
he said. "Now war is no longer looked down upon. It's not like Vietnam. People 
believe we did something good in the Persian Gulf. Paintball has benefited from 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 80% of paintball players are men, statistics show. Most of the games 
are pickup-style -- team members chosen at random moments before the whistle 
blows. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the paintball field has also been the site of some pretty strange 
battles. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the executive who, dressed in shirt and tie, took notes on the play to 
observe how workers handled pressure and who would emerge as a leader and who 
would panic. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the Pepperdine fraternity battles. Pistol-armed pledges are 
given two minutes to hide before being hunted down by the frat boys with 
semiautomatic paintball weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, however, Close Encounters caters to the beginner. Schwartz 
prides himself on "turning wimps to warriors," teaching tactics and strategy to 
the wide-eyed and wanting. For $35, players are equipped with a single-fire 
pistol, a mask and several hundred paint pellets. More sophisticated firepower, 
camouflage suits and ammunition pouches cost more, which can bring a day's 
expenses to $100 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 At the camp's three 40-acre battlefields, beginners have other advantages. 
Their single-shot guns fire farther than those of more experienced fighters. 
They also get "reincarnation privileges" -- if killed within the first 10 
minutes of battle, they often are allowed to rise and fight again. 
</P>
<P>
 Other rules put a lid on aggressive emotions. Players can shoot an enemy only 
twice, not 10 times, before he is adjudged dead. Swearing isn't allowed. And 
players may not fire from closer than 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 After one battle, Mike Daclan and his boys were breathless -- this wasn't war, 
this was work . 
</P>
<P>
 They lounged in a rest area reminiscent of the set of "M.A.S.H." -- with 
camouflage-netted tables and tents nestled just over the hill from the traffic 
hissing along the Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm gasping for air," said Brad, a 25-year-old advertising salesman. "In this 
game, you don't run up that hill to capture the other guy's flag. You go for an 
oxygen tent. This isn't flatland out here. After six games, running up- and 
down-hill, you're ready for a stretcher." 
</P>
<P>
 Winded, some suffering sprained ankles from stumbling in the woods, the dozen 
friends were nevertheless jazzed by the battle. "We're out here to be little 
boys again," said one 16-year-old. "You don't have to go, 'Blam-blam-blam, 
you're dead!' You hit them with a paintball." 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank newlyweds Leticia and Spencer Siegel said they appreciated the work of 
real soldiers after being both the hunter and the hunted in the free-for-all 
gun battles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary at first," Leticia said. "They blow the whistle and you feel 
yourself running for your life. But then you get to shoot somebody. It's like a 
real war in that way. You get to say to yourself, 'Yeah, I wasted that guy. One 
less enemy to worry about.' So, it's pretty cool. It's a natural high." 
</P>
<P>
 But she tasted death in the same battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was weird. I was face to face with the guy who killed me. But that's OK. 
While I'm here, I want to experience everything. I want to kill and be killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Out on the battlefield, everything is splotched with bursts of wild paintball 
color: trees, walls, the dirt, even passing dogs. The air, always filled with 
the zing of pellets, smells of pizza. Somebody on the picnic tables ordered 
takeout Domino's. 
</P>
<P>
 The whistle blows and the two teams converge under the gaze of a referee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keep moving, you jerks!" someone yells. Zing! Zing! The talking head retreats 
behind a tree, then pops back out. "What are ya, chicken? We need some help up 
here!" 
</P>
<P>
 Then the field general is hit in the shoulder with a splatter of orange paint. 
Following the rules, he raises his right arm to show he's been hit, then treads 
sulkily off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it!" he says. "Just like that, I'm dead. It's not fair, 
dude."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; NEWPORT COAST DRIVE TOLL PROPOSAL ATTACKED 
</P>

<P>
 Opponents of a plan to put tollbooths on Newport Coast Drive turned out in 
force last week to urge the City Council to oppose the plan and stop the 
proposed construction of a $17.5-million bypass. 
</P>
<P>
 The bypass is intended to give drivers who travel on Newport Coast Drive 
between Irvine and Pacific Coast Highway an alternative route, to avoid paying 
a toll on the planned San Joaquin Hills Toll Road. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1 1/2-mile portion of Newport Coast Drive southeast of MacArthur Boulevard 
would become part of the toll road. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no legal way tolls can be charged on Newport Coast Drive, as we 
intend to have the courts declare," said attorney Jim Toledano, who represents 
the Newport Coast Drive Defense Fund.  
</P>
<P>
 The homeowner organization has filed suit against the Transportation Corridor 
Agencies to block the planned tollbooths. 
</P>
<P>
 Toledano told council members that the alternative route, which he calls the 
"mark of Zorro" because of its zigzag pattern, will increase traffic in Irvine 
significantly. 
</P>
<P>
 An environmental impact report on the proposed realignment of Newport Coast 
Drive contains three alternative routes. But all require the zigzag route for 
drivers to avoid paying a toll. The report is available for public review until 
Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 George Gallagher, president of the Irvine Conservancy, said the city should 
refuse to cooperate with any plan to put tollbooths on Newport Coast Drive 
until the lawsuit is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members were reluctant to comment on the planned tollbooths.  
</P>
<P>
 The bypass project will come before the City Council for approval in late 
January or early February. RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; INTERMEDIATE PUPILS WILL START SCHOOL 30 
MINUTES EARLIER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Most of Santa Ana Unified School District's intermediate schools will start 
their daily sessions half an hour earlier, beginning Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 The board voted unanimously last week to add about 30 minutes to the 
intermediate school day after an auditor's annual review of the district 
suggested children were spending less time in school than they should, district 
spokeswoman Diane Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new plan, year-round schools will begin extended schedules starting 
Thursday. The three campuses on traditional calendars -- McFadden, MacArthur 
and Willard intermediate schools -- will begin the extended day schedules Jan. 
3. Once the new schedules take effect, students will start their day about 8 
a.m., although the exact time will vary slightly from school to school, Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most schools will extend each class by about five minutes to add the required 
minutes. Parents at McFadden and Sierra opted to add a mini-class instead, to 
avoid potential scheduling problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The board decided to add the minutes midyear, after auditors said the state 
educational code requires schools to offer about 50 more hours of instruction 
each year than the district currently provides, Thomas said. JON NALICK

<P>
 Community members will get one last chance to give Irvine Unified School 
District consultants their opinions on the qualities they want in a new 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of Management Analysis and Planning Associates, the 
Berkeley-based firm hired by the district to survey community opinions, will 
meet with residents from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Thursday at school district 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm has already interviewed 150 community members during a three-day 
period earlier this month and received comments by letter and fax. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 6, the school board will decide whether to launch a search outside the 
district for candidates to replace former Supt. David E. Brown, who was hired 
in 1987.  
</P>
<P>
 Brown left at the end of October to become superintendent of the Napa Valley 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Long and Paul Reed, two of the district's three deputy superintendents, 
are candidates for the job.  
</P>
<P>
 Long was hired in 1987 as deputy superintendent of personnel services.  
</P>
<P>
 Reed, deputy superintendent of business services, joined the school district 
in 1974 as a special education teacher. He was promoted to an administrative 
position in 1986 by the school district's founding superintendent, A. Stanley 
Corey. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Waldfogel, deputy superintendent of curriculum and instruction, said he 
is not interested in the job.  
</P>
<P>
 Waldfogel is serving as interim superintendent of the 21,500-student district. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's consulting firm will continue to accept letters from community 
members who cannot attend the final meeting with the consultant.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; CHILD SAFETY GROUP OFFERS HOLIDAY TIPS FOR 
PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Christmas shopping kicked into high gear, a local center dedicated to 
fighting child abductions urged parents to use extra caution and offered safety 
tips for the often-frantic holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 Abductions and attempted child snatchings typically increase about 15% to 20% 
in Southern California during the Christmas shopping season, said Peter Caruso, 
spokesman for the Adam Walsh Center in Orange, a branch of the National Center 
for Missing and Exploited Children. 
</P>
<P>
 Caruso said the figure is based on calls received by the local office, which 
keeps track of such incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization does not want to frighten parents or children, Caruso said. 
But the center wants wants the public to know that molesters and abductors are 
more active during the holiday season, taking advantage of harried parents 
trying to navigate crowded shops, malls and parking lots, often while also 
watching several children. 
</P>
<P>
 It only takes a few seconds for a child to become lost, snatched or lured 
away, Caruso said, adding that molesters or abductors also may "stalk" victims 
to determine how well they are being watched by a parent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very hectic, chaotic time and people who are molesters and people who 
want to abduct children know this," Caruso said. "There are so many tricks that 
molesters can use." 
</P>
<P>
 Caruso also offered parents the following safety tips: 
</P>
<P>
 * If possible, work out a baby sitting trade-off with friends or neighbors so 
children can remain safe at home during the shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Set shopping rules before leaving home. Children should keep close to a 
parent at all times and should never talk to strangers. Children should be 
taught that if lost in a store, they should remain inside, stay in one area and 
ask a store clerk or a manager -- never a stranger -- for help finding their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't leave children unattended. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reinforce good behavior by praising or hugging a child and promising them a 
reward. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bring along a nutritious snack or a favored toy to keep a child attentive 
and less likely to wander away. Play word games and help them feel they are 
involved in the shopping trip, not an unwanted burden. 
</P>
<P>
 Caruso also reminds parents not to allow the stressful shopping season to get 
the best of them. Instead, hold your temper, recognize that "kids will be kids" 
and do not physically or verbally abuse youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keep your children close at all time," he said. RENE LYNCH

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: VILLA PARK; COUNCIL DENOUNCES FEDERAL CLEAN AIR PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has denounced a proposed plan by the federal government to 
require planes, ships, railroads and trucks throughout the nation to have 
stronger anti-emission controls. 
</P>
<P>
 The council last week unanimously passed a resolution urging President Clinton 
to halt the Federal Clean Air Implementation Plan.The plan is scheduled to 
become effective by executive order Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 In its resolution, the council charged that the federal plan would remove 
"local control over air quality issues and transfer them to the federal 
government." The council also asserted that the federal plan would "cost the 
Los Angeles area economy alone $35 billion, eliminate 345,000 jobs and 
disproportionately harm small businesses, minorities and economically 
disadvantaged people." 
</P>
<P>
 The council said it supports efforts to make the nation's air cleaner and 
safer. But in its resolution, the council argued that the Administration's plan 
"proposes unattainable standards" for the state's industries. 
</P>
<P>
 School districts would be among the economic victims of the clean air plan, 
according to the resolution, costing them more than $600 million by "rendering 
most school buses obsolete."BILL BILLITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council last week granted Jewelry Tech Institute an additional two 
years to operate a trade school at the Hoover Street Center. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials requested the longer permit to coincide with the five-year 
lease of two buildings at the business center, where the school is moving from 
its present location a block away on Garden Grove Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the Planning Commission granted the school, which offers courses 
in jewelry design and English to mostly Vietnamese students, a three-year 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Afy Harraf, the school's director of operations, said the school is 
transferring from its campus for the past 15 years at Western Avenue to the 
larger facilities at Hoover Street Center. The school has about 140 students, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harraf said the school likely would move in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The council last week also granted a request for a one-way entrance to the 
school from Garden Grove Boulevard and exits only onto Hoover Street. BERT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BUENA PARK; COUNCIL CHAMBERS TO GET NEW SOUND SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After years of complaints, the City Council has agreed to buy a high-tech 
sound system for the council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Surroundsound system will cost about $13,000 and spare viewers who watch 
the council meetings on television from straining to hear words, which 
sometimes are lost amid the sounds of rustling papers and tapping pens. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current council chamber sound system is outdated, frequently inoperable 
and requires service on a regular basis," Operations Manager Paul De Pietro 
told the council last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The job was given to Primesound Co. in Buena Park. Newly elected Councilman 
Gerald N. Sigler questioned the propriety of having the job awarded without 
bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. James L. Markman told the council that the city is allowed to 
dispense with bidding when the item is highly specialized. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is, nobody has the same system," he said. "There is no way to get 
equivalent bids and go with the lowest bidder." 
</P>
<P>
 Other council members said they are just glad the problem is going to be 
resolved.  
</P>
<P>
 The microphones on the council dais frequently pick up extraneous noise and 
often, while the voices of speakers addressing the council can be heard 
clearly, the responses of council members are lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The 130-seat chamber will have to be closed for about two weeks for 
installation. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Alcene M. Cain said the work will probably be done at the end of 
January. LESLEY WRIGHT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; HIKE IN PARAMEDIC FEES OKD FOR THOSE 
WHO DON'T SUBSCRIBE TO SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents who don't subscribe to the city's paramedic membership program will 
be paying more for the emergency service. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week approved fee increases for non-subscribers and 
rates for third parties, such as insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news is we're not going to increase rates to members," Fire Chief 
Michael P. Dolder said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the city began charging a voluntary fee for people who might need 
emergency paramedic and ambulance services. The current $36 annual subscription 
rate also will remain the same, Dolder said. For subscribers, there is no per 
use charge for the city's emergency paramedic or ambulance service. 
</P>
<P>
 The new third party rates increased $25 to $125 for basic life support service 
and by $50 to $200 for advanced life support service. Non-members will now pay 
$50 more, or $150, for basic life support service, and $100 more, or $250, for 
advanced life support service. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolder said 32% of the city's households are members of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the paramedic program is $3.6 million, while revenue from 
membership and user fees contribute more than $2 million annually to the 
program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The increased rates will offset the costs associated with providing emergency 
paramedic service, Dolder said.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the current rate structure, members are subsidizing the non-members, 
Dolder said. Fees from membership dues and member's insurance payments fund 54% 
of the program; however, members receive only 25% of the program's services. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolder said the city hopes that by increasing fees to non-members, it will 
encourage more residents to join the program. DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; TOP STUDENTS TEACH PEERS LESSONS IN 
SELF-RESPECT

<P>
 Sometimes the toughest part about being a teacher is trying to handle a 
classroom full of teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask a few students at Silverado High School, who have been leading 
classes for half an hour each week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gave me a whole new perspective," said Eric Cheney, a 17-year-old senior 
who guided a class last week through a lesson on natural frustrations, 
separations and anger, part of a curriculum called "Respect Yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 "A teacher's job is really hard because there are students who don't want to 
learn," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of letting honor students lead the weekly lessons is the brainchild 
of Silverado High School teacher Scott Ferry, who said the approach has 
generated more serious debate on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Wednesday, the students fan out to classrooms at the continuation high 
school for discussions on everything from drug abuse to stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
 Such subjects have provoked strong feelings in students and helped them gain a 
better understanding of themselves and each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned that I have to listen," said Augdosha Ajawara, a 17-year-old 
senior. "I talk a lot and usually don't want to hear from the other side, then 
I ran into somebody who was just like me." 
</P>
<P>
 Kendra Sheffield, a 16-year-old junior, said that students are more willing to 
share their thoughts when a discussion is facilitated by one of their peers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned that people really care more than I thought they would," she said.

 Two elementary school students will be presented this week with one-year 
family memberships to the Children's Museum at La Habra and a box of Christmas 
cards they designed in a museum contest. 
</P>
<P>
 The designs of Danielle Morgan, a first-grader at Ladera Palma Elementary 
School, and Kristen Farrara, a student at Walnut School, were selected last 
month out of 300 entries.The contest, held in June, asked students to draw a 
Christmas scene, said Missy Fleet, president of Friends of the Children's 
Museum at La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan's card features a Christmas tree with a yellow star ornament on top of 
it and a reindeer resembling "a stuffed bear with antlers" standing next to the 
tree, Fleet said. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrara's card features a snowman, complete with top hat and pipe. There are 
also snowflakes and a flower in the background, Fleet said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan and Farrara will get their prize, valued at $40, this Monday and 
Tuesday, respectively, at their schools. 
</P>
<P>
 A box of 12 cards is on sale at the museum's gift shop for $10. Funds raised 
from the card sales benefit the museum's programming fund. So far, the museum 
has sold more than 3,000 cards, Fleet said.

PARK

<P>
 Tired of being booted out of parking lots by angry merchants and traveling to 
Huntington Beach or Encinitas to practice their moves, local skateboarders are 
asking the city to build a skateboard park at Crown Valley Community Park. 
</P>
<P>
 So far their pleas have elicited some support, with three members of the Parks 
and Recreation Commission saying they like the idea of providing a hangout for 
skateboarders. 
</P>
<P>
 Skateboard parks usually contain concrete benches, stairs, ramps and pyramids 
that skateboarders jump on and off in daring tricks and turns. 
</P>
<P>
 At last week's commission meeting, teen-age skateboarder Christian Schromn 
said his father occasionally drives him to Encinitas to use a YMCA-run 
skateboard park there, but he would prefer to take his board to a local park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really need a skateboard park here," said Schromn, one of a dozen 
skateboarders who told the commission what ramps they'd like to see in a Crown 
Valley skateboard park.  
</P>
<P>
 "I skateboard every day behind stores and people hassle us and the police come 
and tell us to leave and it's not much fun," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners said they want the skateboarders to get involved in creating the 
skateboard park and possibly even running it once it's built. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission will discuss the proposal again at its Dec. 12 meeting. YMCA 
member Gary Headrick, who volunteered to help the city plan the park, will 
present drawings of a possible skateboard park. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission will discuss whether a skateboard park should require use of 
safety equipment, such as helmets, and whether skateboarders should pay each 
time they use the park.  
</P>
<P>
 The commission will also look at whether the city should both build and staff 
the park, or just pay for building it and then allow the YMCA or another 
outside organization to manage it. LYNN FRANEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; BINGO EXEMPTED FROM SCHOOL SMOKING 
BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Capistrano Unified School District board has approved a tobacco ban on all 
of its property but would allow certain exemptions for adult after-hours events 
such as bingo. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees first considered a tobacco-free schools policy in late September. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, trustees expressed worries that an outright smoking ban might 
anger bingo players, who hold games at some campuses and have become a valuable 
source of revenue for the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a revised policy approved last week, bingo games and other uses where 
minors are not present would be exempt from the smoking ban, which includes 
smokeless tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Paul B. Haseman said the school district's attorneys had found 
that the revised policy wouldn't jeopardize federal and state funding the 
district expects to receive for making its properties smoke-free. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, trustee Sheila Benecke said that money raised from bingo games 
had built the football stadium at Dana Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees agreed that the majority of avid bingo players seemed to be cigarette 
smokers as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've been to Vegas or bingo, you'll find that a lot of people smoke," 
Haseman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco ban applies to district staff, students, volunteers, contractors 
and vendors.  
</P>
<P>
 Except for bingo and other potential adult-only events, the ban extends to 
people attending activities on school district property.JEFF BEAN

POLICE ARREST 8 IN BUST AT SUSPECTED DRUG LAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight people were arrested, including two from Orange County, when Cypress 
police discovered 10 pounds of a refined form of methamphetamine called "ice" 
and a drug lab in a Lincoln Avenue motel, authorities said Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 The arrests came Saturday night after patrolman Ed Bish ran a routine check on 
the license plate of a Mitsubishi 3000 parked outside the Cypress Suites Motel, 
said Margaret Mueller, a dispatcher for the Cypress Police Department.The car 
had been reported stolen by the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, Mueller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he found out it was stolen, he waited and questioned a man who walked up 
to it," Mueller said. 
</P>
<P>
 With help from federal narcotics agents, police searched rooms in the motel 
and found the "speed," with an estimated wholesale street value of $200,000, 
three loaded firearms, an undisclosed amount of cash, scales and packaging 
materials used in the manufacture of the drug, Mueller said. 
</P>
<P>
 A hazardous waste materials company was also called in to help clean up the 
chemicals used in the lab, Mueller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the suspects included: Felix Davidas, 32, of Garden Grove; Nanette 
Villones, 29, of La Palma; Christopher Advincula, 28, of Lakewood; Allan 
Balahadia, 24, of Artesia; Noel Castro, 33, of Glendale; Guillermo Manila, 24, 
of Cerritos; Alba Bongbong, 39, and George Sotto, 26, both of Los Angeles.

CROSSING UPGRADE PLAN GETS HOMEOWNERS' OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Crestline Homeowners Assn. has agreed to let the city construct retaining 
walls on its property when the Moulton-Alicia Parkway intersection is widened, 
but in exchange the city must build four extra accent walls at the community's 
entrances. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week approved the arrangement with the Crestline 
community, located on the southeast side of the busy intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional walls will cost about $43,000, which the county is expected to 
reimburse the city as part of the $1.6 million in improvements planned for the 
intersection. Acquiring the right-of-way from the homeowners association 
without an exchange was expected to cost roughly $100,000, double the cost of 
the accent walls. 
</P>
<P>
 The improvements include double left-turn lanes in all directions, and 
exclusive right-turn lanes in all directions but one. The right turn from 
northbound Moulton Parkway to eastbound Alicia Parkway will be a free turn in 
which drivers do not have to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crestline homeowners also requested a three-foot landscape planter between 
the seven-foot sidewalk and the retaining walls, another detail approved by the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 The council decided all the intersection's retaining walls will be made of 
concrete and covered with grayish-white cobblestones. The same walls probably 
will be built at other Moulton intersections during future widenings. 
</P>
<P>
 A request by the neighboring Lomas Laguna Homeowners Assn. to install earth 
retaining walls that would blend in with the current landscaping was denied. 
Council members cited the need for consistency as well as irrigation problems 
of so-called "green" walls as the reasons for choosing concrete.

WINDS DISRUPT ELECTRICITY

<P>
 High winds caused a power outage that affected about 3,200 homes from the 
southern section of Sherman Oaks to the northern portion of Bel Air, a Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power spokeswoman said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The power outage at 8:30 p.m. Saturday left customers without electricity for 
an hour, said DWP spokeswoman Darlene Battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The high winds knocked out circuits in the area distributing station," she 
said.

CAR ALARM FRIGHTENS OFF 3 ARMED ROBBERS IN VICTIM'S GARAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A car alarm that went off in a garage apparently frightened off three men 
attempting to rob a 57-year-old Huntington Beach man at gunpoint shortly after 
midnight, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, James Y. Chang, told police that he was surprised by the men at 
12:16 a.m. after he drove into the garage of his home on Red Coach Drive, said 
Sgt. Brian Tidrick of the Huntington Beach Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang said he was getting out of his car when he was confronted by three men 
described as in their 30s, wearing dark clothing and armed with semiautomatic 
handguns, Tidrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The suspects ordered him to open his residence . . . but he was able to 
activate an audible alarm on one of his vehicles," Tidrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 The alarm frightened the men, who ran away and were last seen driving east on 
Red Coach Drive in a white, American-made four-door car, Tidrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured and there was no loss reported, Tidrick said.

MARINE HELD IN CONNECTION WITH DEATH OF STEPSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Marine from Camp Pendleton was being held by military authorities in 
connection with the death of his 3-year-old stepson Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lance Cpl.Nathan Lewis, 20, of Albion, Mich., was placed in custody after 
questioning by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, according to Cpl. Anne 
Donnelly, a base spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical examiner's office in San Diego County has not determined a cause 
of death and an autopsy is scheduled for today, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday night, Camp Pendleton fire officials responded to an emergency 
call Lewis made from his residence on base and transported the child, Anthony 
Williamson, to the nearby Naval Hospital. Williamson was flown by Life Flight 
helicopter to Children's Hospital and Health Center in San Diego and died early 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 A 6-month-old boy, identified as Lewis' son Xavier, was also taken from the 
home to the Naval Hospital and was later transferred to the Naval Hospital's 
Child Protection Unit.

BOARD FEELS HEAT FOR VALEDICTORIAN POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents angry over the elimination of the valedictorian award at Saugus High 
School are expected to be out in force at the meeting of the William S. Hart 
Union High School District board tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over the top grades award erupted earlier this year when the 
school held its first graduation without a valedictorian, salutatorian and 
top-10 student honors. Instead, the school designated anyone with a 3.75 or 
higher grade point average as an honors student. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's would-be valedictorian, Brad Bjelke, was interviewed on national 
television and was asked to read his valedictory speech on one of the top 
morning radio shows in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bjelke's mother, Mary Lou, said a petition with more than 400 names was given 
to the Hart board a few weeks ago demanding that the honor be re-established. 
</P>
<P>
 Other issues may be more important to the district, but few have been as 
emotional, said board member Patricia Hanrion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll bring my shield in case the tomatoes fly," she said, referring to 
tonight's meeting at which the board will discuss the policy that allows each 
high school in the district to make its own valedictorian policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is likely to decide only whether it should establish a districtwide 
policy. Further study will be needed to determine just what that policy, if 
established, should be, Hanrion said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she favors leaving the decision to each school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think each school has their own community that may have a different type of 
student at that school," she said. "I'm the kind of person that doesn't like to 
dictate." 
</P>
<P>
 School authorities said the pressure on some students to achieve the 
top-student award was so great that one student became suicidal. In addition, 
they say, students were avoiding the subjects they wanted to study, enrolling 
instead in easy classes or honors courses to inflate their grades. 
</P>
<P>
 "It never occurred to me there were ways to tweek a grade point average to get 
into that position, and I'm hearing from kids that's the way it is done," 
Hanrion said. 
</P>
<P>
 A second local school, William S. Hart High School, has not honored a 
valedictorian in more than 10 years. But the policy approved by Saugus High 
officials at the end of the 1992-93 school year sparked the controversy when it 
took effect a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry parents argued that the decision sacrificed one principle of public 
education -- that students should be encouraged to excel. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Bjelke echoed that viewpoint in his radio address. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our administration has decided that academic competition is not healthy," he 
told listeners. "However, I am privileged to represent the Class of 1994, and 
regardless of this year's new policy, I am still the valedictorian." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lou Bjelke said she doubts the valedictorian policy will be changed right 
away, but isn't discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is not going to go away," she said. "That's obvious, because we 
have a community that's still up in arms over this."

</P>
<P>
 On paper, Keith sees a lot of similarities between this team and last season's 
squad. "We had the stereotypical rebuilding season last year and went through 
all those kinds of struggles," Keith said. "And looking at it this year from an 
experience standpoint, it looks like we're almost in a rebuilding year again, 
but I think we are considerably better." Keith, in his eighth season at Irvine, 
thinks the Vaqueros have a more talented team from top to bottom. His mission 
will be to find a lineup that can combine to do more than individual things 
well. "We've got guys who are good shooters and some who are good shot-blockers 
and some who are good rebounders, but we don't have too many guys who do a lot 
of things well," Keith said. "Those are the kinds of things we need to focus 
on, getting guys to play the whole game." Irvine will be smaller than in any of 
Keith's previous seasons, but he expects Carlson to provide interior defense 
and shot-blocking. Parker led the team in scoring over the summer, and joins 
Hill and Guinn as three-point threats.

<P>
 In 1992-93, the Sea Kings won the Southern Section Division IV-AA championship 
with an up-tempo style that was a departure from the traditional ultra-patient 
Corona del Mar teams. This season, Orris will return to that fast-paced style 
to try to compensate for a lack of size. Corona del Mar's tallest player is 
6-4, but the Sea Kings make up for it with good shooting. "Definitely, we're 
going to have to be concerned with our lack of size, but we're athletic and all 
nine guys we'll have on the varsity can shoot it," Orris said. "We're not a 
team that can pound it inside, so we're going to run and press a lot more to 
take advantage of our speed and athleticism." Fracalosy will be a chief scoring 
threat, with the ability to shoot the three and slash to the basket. DeGrazier, 
who split time between the varsity and junior varsity last year, and Owen will 
handle point-guard duties. While size might be lacking inside, Orris is pleased 
with the efforts of Schiff, Coleman, MacDonald and Klinke against bigger 
players.

 There's good news and bad news for the Sailors, according to Smith. First, the 
bad news: "We're not big, we're not especially quick, and we play a very tough 
schedule," Smith said. And the good news? "We've got intelligent players who 
realize this and know they'll have to make up for it by playing smart and as a 
team, which I think they'll do," he said. Newport Harbor will face stiff 
competition in the Tournament of Champions and the San Diego Above the Rim 
tournament, and Smith hopes the killer schedule will have the Sailors ready for 
the rigors of the Sea View League. Torribio is the team's top perimeter scoring 
threat, with Rankin providing the ability to drive to the hoop. Newport Harbor 
will rely on a team effort on the boards, led by Peikert and Badorek. "Our 
destiny will lie in our ability to play together and work together to make us 
better as a unit than we could be individually," Smith said.

 Woodbridge became bigger and better instantly last spring when Burgess 
transferred from Mater Dei. Halagan, in his third year as Warriors coach, 
compares Burgess favorably with former Woodbridge standout Adam Keefe, now with 
the NBA's Utah Jazz. "Chris is a lot bigger than Adam was as a sophomore and 
even a little more versatile at this point, especially from the perimeter," 
Halagan said. "He's obviously going to be a very, very good player for us down 
the road." Halagan plans on using Burgess from a variety of positions on the 
floor, not just as a turn-and-shoot post player, to take advantage of Burgess' 
outside shooting touch. But it won't be all Burgess for Woodbridge. Semm and 
Ripley are third-year varsity players and Halagan expects them to increase 
their offensive output this season. The Warriors lack experience in the 
backcourt, but Halagan expects Jenkins, Brown and Stovall to progress quickly. 
Woodbridge could play as many as 10 or 11 players regularly in its trapping and 
pressing defensive style.

 Shoemaker takes over for long-time coach Tim Travers (now an assistant at 
Saddleback College) and brings extensive coaching experience to the Chargers. 
Shoemaker spent the last six seasons as an assistant at the University of the 
Pacific and also coached at La Mirada High before UOP. So far, he likes what he 
sees at El Toro. "I got a good look at the team coaching them during the 
summer, and I think we're pretty talented," Shoemaker said. "We can shoot the 
ball pretty well and we're versatile, which I like." Senik, who will play point 
guard, and Ellis are the top perimeter shooting threats. Ellis had arthroscopic 
surgery on both knees five weeks ago and might not be ready early in the 
season. Michael is the team's top defender, but Shoemaker is concerned about El 
Toro's rebounding ability. "We're obviously smaller than what I'm used to at 
the college level, but we do have some decent size, so I'd like to see us 
improve a lot on the boards," he said. Wulfemeyer is the son of Orange County 
prep scoring legend Mark Wulfemeyer, who played at Troy.

SHOP TALK: ORIENTATION, OTHER MANDATORY HOURS COUNT TOWARD PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: I was hired as a temporary helper for a store in the local mall. We 
were required to come in on a Sunday for a three-hour orientation. Are they 
required to pay us for that? 
</P>
<P>
 L.C., Brea 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Yes. Generally, hours devoted to activities required by an employer 
count toward the maximum of 40 hours of work permitted per week. Calling the 
activities orientation, training or continuing education does not exclude them 
from the maximum hour calculation.

 Our organization is composed of salaried employees involved in apartment 
management. All of our offices are staffed seven days a week. Our question is: 
What are the holidays, if any, for which the employer must allow his or her 
employees time off? 
</P>
<P>
 -- S.D., Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Neither the California Industrial Commission Welfare Order nor the 
federal wage and hour laws require an employer to give holidays off. However, 
an employer may have to grant time off to reasonably accommodate the religious 
needs of its employees unless this would cause the employer undue hardship. For 
example, an employer does not have to close its entire operation on Christmas 
Day.

 Question: Is it legal for an employer to withhold any vacation, holiday or 
sick pay accrued until the 91st day of employment? 
</P>
<P>
 -- L.F., Westminster 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: There is no employer obligation to provide vacation, holiday or sick 
leave benefits for employees. Any obligation would depend on whether these 
benefits are included as a provision in an employment contract, collective 
bargaining agreement, stated as a written employer policy or a company 
established practice. Vacation as well as sick leave plans can vary 
significantly among employers. If your employer has a policy or a practice that 
accrues vacation from the first day of employment, you can't lose what the 
employer states you will receive. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers will often write policies that disallow accruals during probationary 
(orientation) periods, typically the first 90 days of employment. Therefore the 
accrual is based on only the last nine months of employment in the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 It is certainly not uncommon for an employer to permit accrual from the first 
day of employment but clearly indicate that an employee must complete a full 
year of service before being allowed to request vacation time off. However in 
this situation, if an employee should leave the company, all vacation pay 
earned but not taken must be paid at termination at the employee's final rate 
of pay. 
</P>
<P>
 If the company policy states that sick leave accrual can be taken only after 
completion of 90 days and only if the employee is sick, there is no entitlement 
at separation. I recommend you review company policies very carefully, if 
indeed there is an obligation.

 Question: I worked for a large company and was denied breaks for two years. I 
was wondering if it was too late to seek compensation, as it has been two to 
three years since I worked there. 
</P>
<P>
 -- L.C., Aliso Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: According to state law, an employer must provide a paid rest period 
for at least 10 minutes for non-exempt employees working at least 3 1/2 hours 
in one day. For an eight-hour work period, two rest periods are required (in 
addition to an unpaid lunch break of at least 30 minutes). The required rest 
period must be, if possible, within the middle of the work period. It is 
clearly improper for your employer to deny you the breaks allowed you by law. 
You have a variety of ways of possibly handling this matter. 
</P>
<P>
 If you rely upon breach of the statutory law, according to the Orange County 
office of the state labor commissioner's office, you have no additional claim 
for compensation because you were in fact paid for the time worked. You cannot 
treat the denied breaks as a claim for unpaid vacation. They do say, however, 
that complaints made to their office can result in a civil penalty against the 
employer payable to the state as well as an order to cease such practices in 
the future. Even if the labor commissioner's office does not think that you 
have a valid claim based on such a statute, a judge may feel differently if you 
pursued it in small claims court or through an attorney. The statute of 
limitation's deadline for breach of a statute is three years from the date of 
each denial of breaks, which you still may be within. 
</P>
<P>
 You may also have contractual claims. It the employer orally represented that 
it would allow you these breaks, then the deadline is two years from the date 
of each breach of such agreement, which you have passed. The deadline for 
breach of a written agreement, as shown by an employee's handbook or a poster 
regarding such polices in the office, is four years from the date of each 
breach. Thus, you still may have a claim in this regard. 
</P>
<P>
 If your employment ended because you complained about such practices, then you 
may also have a claim for illegal retaliation, with a three-year deadline from 
the date of your termination. 
</P>
<P>
 If you were fired for performance reasons, you also might have a possible 
claim against the company for wrongful termination if your poor performance was 
due to the failure of the employer to follow the law giving you breaks, which 
were designed to improve performance. 
</P>
<P>
 If you quit because you objected to the denial of your breaks, you might have 
a "constructive wrongful termination" case. You would have to show that the 
conditions of working there under those circumstance were so intolerable that 
any reasonable person would have likewise quit. This may have a three-year 
statute of limitation deadline from the date of termination. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you do make a claim for compensation, evaluate whether it is even 
worth it. If it has been, for example, 2 1/2 years from the date of your 
termination, then you can realistically only argue for a half year of denied 
breaks, at least on a statutory deadline of three years. Six months of denied 
breaks of 20 minutes per day would amount to approximately 43 hours at your 
normal hourly rate. Conceivably, if you show that the breaks would have 
extended a normal eight-hour work day to beyond that period, you might be able 
to argue overtime compensation of 1 1/2 times your normal rate. Combining your 
claim for unpaid compensation with one of your other potential claims might 
give your case enough substance to get your former employer's attention.

 Question: My company has always been a direct manufacturer with a direct sales 
force. They have now decided to open up all their production facilities to 
brokers but also keep a direct sales force. As their direct salesperson for 
almost 20 years, I feel that it is in my best interest to go out on my own and 
broker my product to my current customer base through my current company, or 
any other company that can give my customer a better deal. Is the work contract 
that I signed 20 years ago enforceable by the company now that they have 
changed their method of operation?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Probably, unless the contract you signed is somehow an invalid 
restraint of trade. However, even if the contract is illegal there are various 
laws, such as the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, that would prohibit you from 
taking confidential information that you have learned from your employer and 
using it to compete with your employer. You could subject yourself to 
substantial legal liability if you pursue the course of action you are 
apparently contemplating.

 Question: I was terminated by my company less than two months after being 
placed on disability for severe back problems. I am over 50 and had been 
employed in a salaried professional-technical position for 20 months. My 
benefits were terminated immediately, but I received two weeks' severance pay 
and the company paid for short- and long-term disability to supplement my SDI 
payments. I was told the reason I was fired "was the need to fill my position." 
My termination letter said "because of the nature of the business." The company 
. . . employs more than 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
 No mention was ever made in company policies of the California Family Rights 
Act or the federal Family and Medical Leave Act, although it does mention 12 
weeks of unpaid "family care leave." I understand that the law allows 12 weeks 
of leave in a 12-month period for the employee's own serious health condition. 
Was my termination legal? Should I file a complaint? All employees were 
required to sign a document agreeing to arbitration for dispute resolutions 
regarding termination or harassment in early 1993, when a change was made in 
the company's benefit package. Does this prevent me from filing a complaint? 
Could I receive any financial compensation? I am now able to return to work 
after 10 months on disability and was told to check with the company for 
possible openings when I was available. 
</P>
<P>
 -- B.P., San Clemente 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Employees who have worked for more than one year for a company with 50 
or more employees and who have worked a minimum of 1,250 hours in the previous 
12 months may take leave for up to 12 weeks for a serious health condition 
under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act and the analogous state law. 
These laws entitle the employee to various job protections, including the right 
to be restored to the same or an equivalent job when they return from leave. 
The right to job restoration applies only if the employee is capable of 
returning from family act leave within the statutory 12-week period, however. 
Thus, while you have had a valid Family and Medical Leave Act claim if you had 
been able to return to work within 12 weeks of beginning your leave, you do not 
have a right to reinstatement to your old job 10 months later. Since your 
company has expressed an interest in re-employing you, instead of filing a 
lawsuit or a claim against the company that likely would not be successful, you 
should take them up on their offer to explore possible open positions.

 Hot off the press last week -- and just in time for Christmas -- is the new 
holiday gift catalogue from the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba 
Linda, which proves that basketball stars and Hollywood moguls don't have a 
monopoly on the use of the term dream team.  
</P>
<P>
 The new catalogue includes two T-shirts for $18.50 each that read "The Dream 
Team" and feature a picture of the late President with Elvis Presley. A $45 
Dream Team quartz crystal watch features the same photo. 
</P>
<P>
 The snapshot was taken in 1970 when Elvis dropped by the White House 
unannounced to chat about the nation's drug wars. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to offering Dream Team merchandise, the library for the holidays 
has scheduled a special lecture on Dec. 10 by former White House lawyer Egil 
(Bud) Krogh, eyewitness to the summit between the President and The King. 
Krogh's account of the meeting, "The Day Elvis Met Nixon," has been added for 
the first time to the catalogue at $18.95. 
</P>
<P>
 The library, which receives no government funding, has become an especially 
active marketer of its merchandise. Officials there say sales of memorabilia 
have been especially heavy in recent months with the surge in interest about 
Nixon's career after his death earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to the holiday catalogue again from past years is the "birthplace 
birdhouse." The item, which sells for $45, is a miniature model of Nixon's 
boyhood home and is described in the catalogue as "redesigned as Presidential 
quarters for your fine feathered friends." She's the One 
</P>
<P>
 Also new from the Nixon library for the holidays is a "personal shopper" to 
fill memorabilia orders during the shopping rush. 
</P>
<P>
 The catalogue reads: "Call Debi, our own Nixonette (yes, really; she waved the 
flag in the '72 campaign) to help out with your gift chores." Monkey Business 
</P>
<P>
 Another Nixon-era gift possibility comes in the form of authentic costumes 
from the "Planet of the Apes" movie series that was popular in the late 1960s 
and early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 The costumes, marketed for $2,995 by Beverly Hills-based The Planet Co., "have 
been locked in a warehouse for nearly two decades," according to company ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Featured are costumes of orangutans, which were the city elders in the film; 
chimps, which were the doctors and lawyers, and the military gorillas. Briefly. 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Boldly going for the $$$: Corona-based Autograph Collectors magazine says that 
signed photos of Leonard (Mr. Spock) Nimoy currently sell for $95 to $150, 
slightly more than the $75 to $125 range for William (Capt. Kirk) Shatner and 
the $50 for Patrick (Capt. Picard) Stewart of Star Trek: The Next Generation. . 
. . A San Francisco company is marketing for $59.95 a pen purportedly filled 
with disappearing ink once used by the KGB, touting it as a way to "hide all 
traces of clandestine weekends, love letters, hotel registrations" and other 
sensitive matters.

SEX, MURDER, THE SOUTH . . . AND HE'S SURPRISED HIS BOOK'S A HIT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Once he found a publisher, John Berendt acknowledged with a half laugh, there 
was the marketing problem. No one quite knew where to put his book. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it a travelogue? True crime? Weird sex? Or general nonfiction, a 
first-time author's sure sojourn in Purgatory? Maybe "Midnight in the Garden of 
Good and Evil" (Random House, 1994) belonged in the regional section, alongside 
stories about yuppies from the Northwest and anthologies of snow literature 
from Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Berendt can afford the whole laugh now. Since its publication in January, his 
book has probably shown up in every one of those categories. More significant, 
as far as Berendt and his publisher are concerned, "Midnight in the Garden of 
Good and Evil" quickly lodged itself on national bestseller lists; 37 weeks, at 
last count, on the New York Times list alone. 
</P>
<P>
 This makes "Midnight," as fans refer to this chatty account of the murder of a 
young hustler by his well-to-do male patron, eligible for the much-coveted 
title of publishing phenom. A gay murder, a black drag queen and an assortment 
of quirky Savannah, Ga., characters did not exactly fit the formula for 
best-selling success. 
</P>
<P>
 Berendt's then-agent and longtime friend Lynn Nesbitt dismissed the book as 
"too local," and Random House had modest expectations at best. Berendt wrote it 
with no advance and drew a respectable, but certainly not astounding, figure 
when the manuscript was finally sold by his new agent, Amanda Urban. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, Berendt said, relishing this twist in his publishing tale, "They're 
translating it into Norwegian. German! Japanese! Italian! Portuguese!" 
</P>
<P>
 He made these disclosures recently in an unlikely setting for a best-selling 
author -- a high school English class. After a 22-city promotional tour, plus a 
"Good Morning, America" segment in which Berendt led viewers on a tour of 
Savannah, he found himself in front of 15 seniors at the fashionable Noble & 
Greenough School here early one morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Berendt, a former editor of New York magazine who now writes a column for 
Esquire, said he was intrigued when a student from Bill Bussey's "Madness in 
Literature" class contacted him at home in New York. After reading essays 
Bussey's students wrote about his book, he paid his own way to fly to this 
Boston suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Berendt said, "It's one thing for your book to be bought. It's 
another to have it taught." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaning against the bright green chalkboard, Berendt was peppered with 
questions. Were any of the characters in "Midnight" upset about being included 
in the story, asked a boy in a striped tie, "or were they psyched?" A girl with 
waist-length green hair wondered if Berendt had made it onto the select 
male-only Christmas party list of one of his major characters. Another boy 
inquired how 12th-grade English class had affected his writing. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a feast for any literary ego, and Berendt -- at 55 looking a bit like 
an overgrown preppie himself in his slacks and blue blazer -- beamed clear 
through this adulatory interrogation. Admiration was what he had in mind when 
he embarked on his seven-year writing project, drawing him back to Savannah 
again and again. He knew he had a good story, and he figured his book might 
become "a sort of cult favorite." But far from fantasizing about a bestseller, 
Berendt said, he dreamed of critical approval. 
</P>
<P>
 In large part he was rewarded. "One could almost be reading Nancy Mitford or 
Evelyn Waugh," wrote Los Angeles Times book critic Richard Eder. "Berendt 
achieves their social comedy." 
</P>
<P>
 But some critics faulted him for blending fact with fabrication -- confusing 
the reader, these critics said, and thrusting the book into some nether world 
between novel and nonfiction. 
</P>
<P>
 In front of the students, Berendt raised the same defenses he offers in 
private. "My argument is that most nonfiction books are reconstruction," he 
said. If he set out today to write about Franklin D. Roosevelt, he said, he 
would probably have a tough time with the kind of intimate conversations that 
tend to go unrecorded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry," Berendt said. "I reconstruct." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not one character in his book is made up, and none is a composite, Berendt 
said. But several have had their names changed, and in some cases, Berendt 
presents as fact actions and conversations that were only described to him. One 
graphic sex scene reads as if Berendt had been lurking in the bushes with 
binoculars. In fact, it took place before he even visited Savannah -- and by 
the time he did, one of the parties involved was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Berendt conceded that this was a form of creative license. But this liberty, 
as well as some restructuring, made his book more entertaining. "And I think 
all writing should be entertaining," he said. "Legal documents, whatever." 
</P>
<P>
 Savannah was so strange without embellishment, he said, that he omitted 
"things that were true . . . because I knew the reader wouldn't believe them." 
His characters held little back, even when they saw him with a notebook or tape 
recorder. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the South, they love to act out," Berendt said. "They are shameless, just 
shameless. They dote on their eccentricity. And tradition and the past are with 
them all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar idiosyncrasies and bizarre events might have presented themselves in 
New York City, Berendt agreed. But familiarity does breed a certain conceit; 
you live in a place long enough, and you walk right past the oddities without 
seeing them. When he was first stationed at an Army base in Georgia, he 
remembered, he immediately noticed side-by-side garbage cans. One was labeled 
"Edible Garbage" -- prompting Berendt to wonder just what was meant by this 
description. The other said "Inedible Garbage." By day two in the Army, he 
didn't give the cans a second glance. 
</P>
<P>
 By journeying south, Berendt turned himself into the eternal outsider, a 
well-worn vehicle for writers of fiction and nonfiction alike. He shared with 
his readers "the sense of discovery," wandering with them into "a place that 
was fresh and exciting -- it was not Chicago, not New York, not New Orleans, 
not L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Every story has to happen someplace, Berendt reasoned; "you have to have a 
location." He was confident that "Midnight" would be of interest outside 
Savannah. What he didn't expect was the level of interest. Savannah officials 
say tourism has skyrocketed since "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" was 
published. The statue pictured on the cover of Berendt's book became such an 
attraction that the family that owns it removed it from its cemetery location. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Berendt found himself in the last empty seat on a plane to Savannah. 
When he remarked on the crowd, the flight attendant -- oblivious to her 
passenger's identity -- just shook her head. "That book!" she exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a small enough city that when Berendt goes back, the unattractive 
qualities he may have revealed about Savannah and some of its leading citizens 
are quickly overlooked by the residents. He is a superstar, so much so that 
when he walks down the street, people honk from their cars and call out, "Hey, 
Mr. Berendt, can I give you a ride?" 
</P>
<P>
 But when he leaves Savannah, it all ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Which is good," Berendt said. "It keeps my head from swelling too much."

HISTORICALLY CORRECT DOLLS? CONFIDENCE AND COURAGE FOR STARTERS.

 The Wrobel family was off for a long weekend, headed to the uplands of 
Wisconsin from their home near Chicago, three hours away. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so fast, 7-year-old Casey Wrobel announced. The family simply couldn't 
pass so close to Pleasant Company without paying a visit, she declared. Now, 
with her 5-year-old sister, Maxine, in tow and her beloved Felicity doll in her 
arms, Casey was pressed against the display cases, drinking in the details of 
her heroines' lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The girls wouldn't let us go anywhere else until we stopped here," Nancy 
Wrobel said. Like hundreds of thousands -- perhaps millions -- of 
pre-adolescent American females, her daughters are held in thrall by five 
fictional girls whose lives span the gamut of American history, from Colonial 
days to the home front of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the American Girls, characters Pleasant T. Rowland dreamed up nine 
years ago in hopes of imbuing 7- to 12-year-old girls with the kind of timeless 
values she grew up with in the 1940s and '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 Confidence, honesty, innocence and courage were what Rowland intended to 
impart when she created Felicity (spunky Colonial girl), Kirsten (tough pioneer 
child), Addy (proud daughter of runaway slaves), Samantha (beguiling Victorian 
orphan) and Molly (helping out on the home front). 
</P>
<P>
 The five characters form the core of Rowland's Pleasant Company, which last 
year recorded sales of more than $150 million -- up 40% from 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically correct dolls, furniture, accessories and clothing account for 
the majority of Pleasant Company's vast, largely direct-mail business. Here in 
the cornfields outside Madison, an average of 15,000 telephone inquiries pour 
in daily to Rowland's 350,000-square-foot command post. Next year, Pleasant 
Company expects to ship between 29 million and 30 million merchandise 
catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
 Many nonfiction writers would pine for the 30,000 first-run printing that 
accompanied each volume in the American Girls "Pastimes" collection of craft 
books, cookbooks, theater kits and paper dolls. American Girl, an 
advertisement-free bimonthly magazine launched two years ago, boasts more than 
400,000 subscribers at $19.95 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Rowland took the American Girls to school, offering a $50 curriculum 
package to elementary school teachers. Fashion shows packaged by Pleasant 
Company for nonprofit organizations regularly attract thousands of mothers and 
daughters, many garbed in their favorite American Girl costumes. A tea party 
that Rowland threw at Colonial Williamsburg in 1991 to introduce Felicity drew 
11,000 guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Book signings turn into similar mob scenes. Clutching their American Girls 
dolls in one hand and their American Girls books in the other, a thousand girls 
wait hours to meet an American Girls author. A series of six books tells the 
story of each character; together, the American Girls books have sold more than 
20 million copies. The "Addy" series alone has sold more than 1 million copies 
in the past six months. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 All of which often strikes Pleasant Rowland as "humbling." But never does her 
success surprise her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess there is some inherent arrogance in saying that my gut told me this 
was the right thing," Rowland said. "I knew it was right. I just did." 
</P>
<P>
 She paused, looked straight ahead and managed to make the following statement 
without sounding the least bit sanctimonious: "And I have come to believe that 
this was what Pleasant Rowland was put in the world to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest child of Pleasant and Edward Thiele grew up in comfortable 
affluence outside Chicago. Her mother stayed home with the kids. Her father was 
president of a large advertising agency. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an idyllic time when television had not yet raised what Rowland, now 
53, regards as its monstrous head in the lives of American families. She read 
voraciously. She played outside unsupervised. "It would never have dawned on us 
to come home and sit in front of the television for four hours," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She studied education in college, taught school, then switched briefly to -- 
horror of horrors -- television, anchoring for KGO in San Francisco. In her 30s 
she edited textbooks and developed teaching materials. At 36, she followed her 
heart to Wisconsin when she met and married the owner of a printing company. 
</P>
<P>
 Attending a convention at Colonial Williamsburg, Rowland experienced a 
full-scale epiphany. "I was just blown away," she recalled, "not just by the 
beauty, but by the vision of the man, (John D.) Rockefeller, who put it 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Rowland felt she was in a ready-made history classroom. But to her dismay, 
"all the materials were geared to adults." She went straight to the foundation 
that runs the facility and proposed a more child-friendly approach. Soon she 
was developing Colonial information packets for kids. 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time, she went Christmas shopping for her nieces. She wanted to 
buy them dolls -- toys they could treasure and maybe even learn from. But this 
was 1984, and all she could find were Barbie or the Cabbage Patch Kids. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rowland's concept quickly sprang into her brain fully formed. Historically 
themed dolls would be accompanied by books, furniture, accessories and 
clothing. "There was an intuitive, unshakable sense that if I did this, other 
people would want it," Rowland recalled. "I just believed; I knew I was not the 
only woman who wanted an alternative" to a bosomy bombshell doll or a scrunchy 
vegetable doll. 
</P>
<P>
 "All that stood between me and its success," she said, smiling in retrospect 
at her own naivete, "was figuring out how to execute it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rowland gave herself a crash course in business. She started Pleasant Company 
with about $1 million of her own, most of it from textbook royalties. She had 
"a vision," but no steel-belted business plan. Her market research consisted of 
sending her sole employee to the park one day to talk to some mothers and 
daughters who were picnicking. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Rowland employs 350 people year-round, and two to three times that many 
during the holiday crunch. Less by design than by circumstance, about 80% of 
Pleasant Company's staff is female. "The estrogen runs thick around here," 
Rowland said. She calls herself "sort of the Mother Superior," adding, "and we 
all think for the good of the order." 
</P>
<P>
 She has filled her huge headquarters with a collection of American art so 
spectacular it comes with its own catalogue. One giant hanging sculpture 
features colorful squiggles that go every which way. The artists, Pam and 
George Castano, call it "Confetti." Some Pleasant Company employees call it 
"Pleasant's Brain." 
</P>
<P>
 They do so cautiously, and only behind the boss's back. Rowland rules with 
meticulous attention to detail and fierce control. Pity the poor employee who 
fails to poof the tissue paper sufficiently in an outgoing order. 
</P>
<P>
 She is adamant that her company's name must never be modified with the . 
Corporate news releases carry the reminder that "the name of the corporation is 
'Pleasant Company,' not 'the Pleasant Company.' " A staffer explained: "The 
characters make for 'pleasant company,' get it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rowland is equally jealous of her privacy. She seldom gives interviews, 
fearing headlines that read, "Lady in Cornfields Makes Good." A photographer is 
permitted in her office only if he agrees to leave his equipment outside; she 
provides a flattering studio head shot. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rowland can also be candid. The suggestion that her gender-specific 
company might somehow imply a bias against boys prompts her to reply: "I can't 
solve all the world's problems. I'm just here working for girls." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The same bluntness arises at the mention of the recurring "knock" against 
Pleasant Company: Its $82 dolls are way out of the price range of most 
families, its concept is too rarefied, and owning a tiny silver tea set just 
like Felicity might have used has very little to do with the present or future 
lives of most American girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, that's such an old knock," Rowland said. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, the company would not be as successful as it is if it were too 
expensive," she continued. Then Rowland trotted out statistics asserting that 
the average American girl owns eight Barbie dolls. "I think eight Barbie dolls 
do not give nearly the kind of value that one American Girl doll does," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Rowland went on, parents of the '90s are sick of "junk and disposable 
plastic. . . . They are making their purchases more meaningful. It's not 'how 
much stuff can I give my kid to prove how successful I am.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rowland found it less easy to slough off some of the criticism that fell to 
Pleasant Company when its product line was all white. An African American doll 
was always on the agenda, she said, but timing and the right approach were 
critical. 
</P>
<P>
 So Addy, the most recent character to join the American Girls lineup, came 
into existence in 1993 after a carefully orchestrated gestation. Rowland and 
her scrupulously constructed board of advisers agreed that a discussion of the 
African American experience had to center around slavery. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilma King, a professor of history at Michigan State University, was part of 
the seven-person advisory panel that reviewed the Addy doll and books during 
the development process. She said questions about using a slave child -- albeit 
one who moves north and gains freedom, as Addy did -- as a toy or role model 
are misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Slavery makes some people uncomfortable. But you can't wish it away," King 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is important to know is that Addy is a fictitious story, and it is 
written for entertainment," she added. Nevertheless, "Like all good children's 
stories, there are some lessons to be learned." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Addy's enormous popularity was unsurprising to Rowland. "Our buyers embraced 
her," she said, noting that the African American doll has managed the unusual 
feat of appealing equally to black and white kiddie consumers. "We could have 
pushed the diversity button sooner." 
</P>
<P>
 Creating Addy was "a wonderful experience," Rowland said. "And if I got hit by 
a truck tomorrow, I could die knowing that we made toy history. We made a black 
doll an object of status and desire for white children." 
</P>
<P>
 She is determined to link girls of today, the women of tomorrow, with those 
who came before them. Her message is quietly feminist, packaged in -- of all 
things -- dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Little girls have always been brave, spunky and honest," she said. "But 
they've had their lives circumscribed by society's expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 In the lobby of Pleasant Company, the Wrobel family was a case study in 
Rowland's philosophy. When Casey wanted a three-foot-tall Barbie doll, her 
father, Bob Wrobel, countered with the offer of a Felicity doll. 
</P>
<P>
 "The history ties all these girls together over the years," Nancy Wrobel said. 
"It becomes a good reference point for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Rowland was a relatively young woman -- 44 -- when she first sketched out the 
goals of Pleasant Company. She had "an enormous amount of energy," and she had 
no children of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't take Freud," Rowland observed, "to say that I wanted to leave a 
lasting legacy." 
</P>
<P>
 America today is a much tougher place than the country she was raised in, 
Rowland concedes. Perhaps American Girls will supply some sense of continuity 
to offset the confusion of modern life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just know how important it is for children to have wonderful and memorable 
childhoods," she said. "I'm very excited about helping to do this, and I just 
want to get on with it."

COMMITMENTS; THE BEST MAN FOR THE JOB IS A WOMAN'S INGENUITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY KORNHEISER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My friend Nancy recently had minor foot surgery and was advised to stay off 
her feet for a while. After a few days, her household food supply dwindled, 
until one night she had only a can of soup for dinner. The next day, she phoned 
her husband at work and mentioned that there was nothing in the house to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 No problem, her husband said. I'll eat out. 
</P>
<P>
 This provoked one of the most common fights between men and women -- the fight 
about women never coming out and saying what they want. (Or, if you're a woman, 
the fight about how men are totally insensitive louts.) 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband reacted like any man would, with selflessness and sympathy. He 
heard her say there's no food in the house. He saw she was laid up with a bad 
foot. He didn't want her to go to any trouble. So he said, "Honey, I'll eat 
out." Presumably, if there was anything left over, he'd bring it home for her. 
</P>
<P>
 Seems reasonable to me. But I am a man. Women are not brought up to say what 
they want. They only hint at it. But it's stupid to hint to men. Men don't 
understand subtlety. That's why they read books by Tom Clancy. Men are like 
mules. If you want them to move forward, you have to hit them in the behind 
with a ball-peen hammer. 
</P>
<P>
 After all these years, how could women not understand this? 
</P>
<P>
 (Women are not only too subtle, but far too demanding; for example, when 
you're dropping them off at a movie so they can buy tickets while you park the 
car, most women actually expect you to come to a complete stop to let them 
out.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure most men believe the world would be a better place if everyone 
thought like a man. I always figured women believed this too. I figured women 
would actually like to be men. Amazingly, though, it turns out they wouldn't!  
</P>
<P>
 I expressed astonishment at this and suggested to my friend Tracee that there 
are many advantages to being a man, not the least of which is the ability to 
drink directly out of the milk carton. She said, and I'm quoting here, "You're 
a dope; you're an idiot." Tracee also worries that her name, spelled that way, 
is too identifiable, so for the remainder of the column, I shall call her 
Tracy, to protect her privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, Tracy's position flabbergasts me, because I can think of only one 
reason for a man to be a woman: to play from the red tees. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Tracy, who is five feet tall, bought a 27-inch TV. The store loaded 
it into the trunk of her car. The box was too big and heavy for her to lift. 
</P>
<P>
 So when she got home, she faced a problem getting the set into her house. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not call a man? I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't call a man for a TV, she explained. You call a man for a 
refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe a man could help you set it up, I said. 
</P>
<P>
 She laughed. Men can't figure out electronic equipment, she said. Women can 
program VCRs better than men. Men can't program them at all. Men don't read the 
instructions. It's just like men don't ask for directions when they're driving. 
Men don't ponder. Men have no patience. The instruction manual that comes with 
an electronic device is the least-read item by men in the history of paper 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the TV out of her car, Tracy propped two wooden boards against the 
fence in her driveway, backed her car to the 2-by-4s -- thus building a small 
platform -- and without really lifting the TV, she rocked the carton onto the 
boards. Then she got a carpet cutter and cut holes in the TV carton. 
</P>
<P>
 So the TV could breathe? I asked smugly. 
</P>
<P>
 No, so I could use them like handles and lift the box, you dork, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she got a luggage cart she uses to wheel her suitcase to the airport, 
slid the TV carton onto the luggage cart, and rolled it from the driveway, 
across the back yard, to her house. She didn't have the strength or leverage to 
lift the carton more than eight inches. Still, she wrestled it up the steps, 
and slid it through the house on a towel so she wouldn't scratch the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 (Can you imagine a man thinking to put a towel down? A man wouldn't care about 
a few scratches in the floor. A man might draw the line at letting a friend 
drive a snowmobile into his living room, but maybe not. Tough call.) 
</P>
<P>
 But Tracy couldn't lift it onto the TV stand. 
</P>
<P>
 So then you called a man, right? I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 No, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She built small scaffolds. She lifted the TV six inches onto a box that held a 
VCR. She lifted the TV six inches again, onto an ottoman. She rolled the 
ottoman to the TV stand and lifted the TV the final six inches to the stand. 
</P>
<P>
 A man would have done it differently, I said. 
</P>
<P>
 And I described how a man would have picked the TV out of the trunk, by 
himself, danced around frantically for a second, gotten a hernia, dropped the 
TV on his foot, breaking the TV and the foot. Then, because men can't handle 
pain nearly as well as women, a man would have gone home and stayed in bed for 
a month. 
</P>
<P>
 He would not run out of food. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy would know to get it for him.

FIRST PERSON: COMMITMENTS; BEING A MAN CAN MEAN BEING LESS THAN WHOLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CROMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 29 years I have been taking life, as the old saying goes, like a man. 
That's American-speak for keeping your face as dry as the Sahara. No tears 
allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most men of my generation, this code of emotional conduct was ingrained 
in me at an extremely young age. The shrieks and howls I let loose upon 
emerging from my mother's womb were just about the last tears I shed without a 
pack of men immediately shouting at me to "walk it off" or "suck it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, that initial burst of tears as a newborn was short and sweet compared 
to the dry spells that have followed. My memory is littered with incidents 
where I really, really wanted to cry, needed to cry, but didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 At first the admonitions against my tears were more or less gentle 
encouragements from the male figures in my life. Firm reminders that men don't 
cry. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember I ate it pretty good one day on my bike as I pedaled furiously 
across a field in a futile effort to keep up with my older brother and his 
buddies. As I sat clutching a scraped knee, I was consoled by my sibling and 
his friends, who also urged me in near-unison, "Don't cry, don't cry, don't 
cry." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, it seems almost as if they were worried they might get caught in 
a compromising position: being seen with a bawling 6-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was that fastball that mowed me down as I stood at the plate during 
my first year of Little League. The coach was on the field at once as I trotted 
off to first base, jogging alongside me as the crowd cheered (apparently 
impressed by the fact that I wasn't being carried off the field). 
</P>
<P>
 "Attaboy, tough guy," he remarked as I struggled hard to not cry. "Walk it 
off. You're OK! Way to go, Bud. . . . Suck it up, now!" 
</P>
<P>
 It's funny, but I don't recall whether he asked if I was all right. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a much less publicly awkward moment when I first realized I was having 
a hard time crying, a rare instance when it probably would have been OK with 
the people who were there. But by that time I couldn't bring myself to do it. 
That was the day my stepfather died of lung cancer, the culmination of a long 
and grueling illness. 
</P>
<P>
 I rode home from the hospital with my mom and brother, sitting silently in the 
back seat. I don't think my mom ever stopped crying. Once we got home I sat in 
the car for a while by myself. I could feel the anguish rising up inside me, 
but somehow it never made it to my eyeballs. I slugged the seat in front of me 
and finally went inside, nursing my hand. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The last time tears cut a path across my face was in October, 1990. A cub 
reporter for a daily newspaper, I was hauled into the executive editor's office 
one afternoon and summarily fired for violating the paper's free-lance policy. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose it was the unexpected nature of it, the sheer suddenness of getting 
canned, that triggered my emotions. I felt like Private Slovak. Bewildered. 
Dazed. I was 24 years old and naive enough to believe my career had ended 
before it really started. 
</P>
<P>
 My managing editor put his arm around me and walked me out of the newsroom to 
my car. I kept a stiff upper lip and dry eyes all the way across the parking 
lot and told him goodby without so much as even a quiver in my voice. But as I 
drove home, I heard a strange sound. A shrill little whimper that was 
punctuated by a gasping for breath as it grew louder. 
</P>
<P>
 I was crying. 
</P>
<P>
 Sobbing. Emotionally succumbing to the notion that I was doomed to a life of 
fast-food jobs and trying to prepare myself for the fact that I would shortly 
have to inform my parents of this. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure how long I cried, but the tears stopped as suddenly as they had 
started. I remember I felt fascinated and yet frightened by the way I sounded 
as I cried. It seemed so childlike. All those barricades that had been erected 
through the years somehow failed to stop these particular tears. I couldn't 
walk this one off, like I had on the field. I couldn't bite my shirt sleeve, 
like I had in the doctor's office. So I just let it go. 
</P>
<P>
 Embarrassed, I made an effort at male atonement a little later that afternoon, 
buying a tall can of beer and stopping off at a friend's house, hoping to get 
cheered up. He took one look at my eyes and asked me if I was stoned. I almost 
told him I was. It sure beat allergies as an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although slightly ashamed that I had been reduced to tears, I'll never forget 
how much better I felt when it was over. It was like that heady feeling one 
gets after a fever breaks. I felt exhausted but relieved. It was as if the 
tears had purged a lot of stress out of my system. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet those tears were a feat I haven't managed since, despite my share of 
funerals and loss and pain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, a couple of times my dry spell has affected my relationship with my 
girlfriend, who has absolutely no trouble crying. I think it might be some sort 
of therapy for her. She cries when she gets really mad; she cries when she's 
really happy; she cries when she is sad. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's natural," she tells me. 
</P>
<P>
 I wish. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, her ability to cry so easily makes me a little edgy -- if jealous -- at 
times. I think I am starting to influence her, because I've noticed that she 
tries to stop crying quickly if I'm around. I should add that I've never told 
her to "walk it off." 
</P>
<P>
 When I've confided my inability to cry to some of my female friends, a few of 
them told me that they sometimes cry every week. They don't seem really proud 
of it, but it carries no stigma for them, which is precisely the point. There 
is no feeling of weakness or shame that comes with their tears. They grew up 
encouraged to cry if they felt like it. At this stage of my life, I'm getting a 
little jealous. I remember how good it felt after the last time I cried. 
</P>
<P>
 But as my luck would have it, this is a dangerous era for a man in his 20s 
learning to cry. The Sensitive Man is dead and his assassin is pounding the 
animal skins and howling under a full moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet while my friends trot off to the hills to beat their drums around a 
roaring bonfire, I think I'm going to try and find the courage to grab that box 
of Kleenex, sit down and surrender to what I've needed for so very, very long: 
a good, healthy, liberating cry. 
</P>
<P>
 As Stuart Smalley would say: "And that's . . . OK!"

 The weeping woman grabbed a stranger's arm -- anybody's would have done. 
</P>
<P>
 She tugged and twisted it before wailing, "I am trying. I am trying so hard to 
like him. (Sniff). But I . . . (sniff, pause, sniff) doooon't."  
</P>
<P>
 Her sobs intensified as she watched her 24-year-old daughter, wearing a black 
bridal dress, nuzzle the neck of her soon-to-be son-in-law one recent Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a bell tolled, beckoning them into the Little Church of the West Wedding 
Chapel in Las Vegas. Daughter gave mother a thumbs up and, in front of the 
groom, shouted: "Don't look so sad, Mom! If it doesn't work, we can always get 
a divorce." 
</P>
<P>
 That attitude, experts say, is more and more common among people in their 20s 
-- a generation often depicted as stuck somewhere between childhood and 
adulthood, not taking much of anything seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an attitude that worries not only parents, but also the academics, 
attorneys, counselors and clergy who have noticed that young people are 
expressing increasing indifference toward matrimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people in their 20s marry with intentions of forever. But when problems 
-- even petty ones -- muddy the expected marital bliss, young couples are quick 
to call it quits. And of those who divorce within five years, experts estimate 
one-third of them entirely discount their first marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know people who act like the first marriage is a dress rehearsal," said Kym 
Jones, 24, a saleswoman in the Northeast, voicing sentiments shared by many in 
her age group. "It's the second one that counts, the real big show." 
</P>
<P>
 These "beginner marriages" concern psychologist Scott Stanley, co-director of 
the Center for Marital and Family Studies at the University of Denver and 
co-author of "Fighting for Your Marriage: Positive Steps for Preventing Divorce 
and Preserving a Lasting Love" (Jossey-Bass, 1994). 
</P>
<P>
 "Young people have this mentality of, 'Oooops, there goes my first marriage. I 
hope it will be better the second time,' " Stanley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a recent study by the National Center for Health Statistics found that 
married people younger than 24 have the highest chance of divorce, 33.8%, 
compared to 24.7% among couples 25 to 44. NCHS researchers analyzed an 
estimated 204,000 marriage and divorce records of people from an 18-state 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate report, preliminary 1993 data from NCHS shows that 38% of 
couples between 25 and 34 divorced -- a 5% increase from 1973, with that 
group's population fluctuating only slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers have produced few studies on beginner marriages. Stuart Walzer, a 
California divorce lawyer for 43 years, said it's easy to dismiss young 
divorces because most do not involve children, property or other assets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, young people matter less since they're not a tremendous burden 
on the (legal) system," Walzer said. "But they should matter, especially if 
people want divorce to decrease in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 He advocates that marrying couples undergo a mandatory four-hour class on 
commitment and marital responsibilities. As a primary reason for those 
throw-away marriages, experts point to the bleak success rate of all American 
marriages over the past two decades: about half fail. After all, those in their 
20s are the children of mothers, fathers and even grandparents who have severed 
nuptial ties. 
</P>
<P>
 As co-owner of the Las Vegas chapel, Greg Smith has witnessed parents marrying 
and remarrying. He's also recognized their children marrying and remarrying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if that signals a lack of commitment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He does know that a chapel minister is concerned about a casual attitude 
toward marriage, particularly in young people. "A lot of them have requested 
that (the minister) omit the 'till death do us part,' " Smith said. "As if 
they're planning for a divorce." 
</P>
<P>
 Divorce is even called easy or "no big deal" by some in their 20s. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of young people don't understand what commitment means," said Marion 
Solomon, a West L.A. psychologist and author of "Lean on Me: The Power of 
Positive Dependency in Intimate Relationships" (Simon & Schuster, 1994). 
</P>
<P>
 Add to that a generation deluged with politicians, celebrities and talk show 
guests bypassing accountability in favor of blaming someone else for their 
problems. "Young people think it's always somebody else's fault if their 
marriage doesn't work," Solomon said. 
</P>

 In retrospect, Ronald Alexander, now 43, is happy his seven-year marriage 
failed. Wed at 24, he recalled meandering through the relationship in dazed 
anomie. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, "the ecstasy was at a high," reflected Alexander, who has 
remained single since his divorce. "Then it shattered, as it often does when 
you find out the person sleeping next to you is not the one you thought you had 
married." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he can chuckle about it. "I learned a lot about who I am," said Alexander, 
a Santa Monica psychotherapist and chairman of the graduate psychology 
department at Ryokan College in West Los Angeles. "Most people in their 20s are 
looking to find out who they are. It's a time of uncertainty." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander's "fantasy marriage" also left him pondering rude romantic 
realities. "I realized that there is no happily ever after. There is no perfect 
love to save you from troubles. Those are the myths of Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since Lisa Conti of Anaheim watched Richard Gere save Julia Roberts from 
her wretched life in "Pretty Woman," the 26-year-old has dreamed of marrying a 
similar savior. Until six months ago, when her husband abandoned their infant 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe I really thought of marriage as so carefree and fun," she 
said. "I now know that it's like hell -- you have to work hard for the bliss. 
I'll know how to do it the second time." 
</P>
<P>
 As insurance for her second marriage, Conti should consider exchanging vows 
with a partner who has also experienced a beginner marriage. NCHS found that 
couples remarrying are less likely to divorce than first-timers. 
</P>
<P>
 More than three-fourths will remarry within five years of their divorces, 
wrote Constance Ahrons in "The Good Divorce: Keeping Your Family Together When 
Your Marriage Comes Apart" (HarperCollins, 1994). 
</P>
<P>
 "Divorce and remarriage are normal," said Ahrons, a USC sociology professor 
and associate director of its Marriage and Family Therapy Program. "It's time 
young couples stopped treating the subject of divorce like blasphemy. . . . 
It's also time people started accepting (beginner) marriages." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Experts are debating how to curb divorce rates, particularly in young people. 
Some say they need premarital counseling, others advocate mandatory classes on 
marriage and divorce provided by high schools or public agencies.  
</P>
<P>
 Almost all agree, however, that living together before marriage rarely helps. 
In fact, a 1989 study from the University of Wisconsin discovered that couples 
who cohabited before marriage divorced more than those who did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Yolanda Baltazar, 23, of Lomita, has advice for people in her age group: Be 
traditional when it comes to marrying. She recently celebrated her second 
wedding anniversary with Ruben, 25. 
</P>
<P>
 She's never read a 1993 study in the Journal of Family Issues. It revealed 
that couples who espouse traditional attitudes feel more satisfied with their 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I know what I'm talking about," Baltazar said. "Marriages won't work 
without love. That is sacrifice, compromise and being able to work through 
problems without maiming or killing anyone."

WRITER BRINGS PAINFUL PART OF PAST TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH MEHREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a novelist and college professor, Connie Porter had enough book ideas to 
keep her computer whirring well into the next century. So when Pleasant T. 
Rowland first telephoned, Porter told her that writing children's books was the 
last thing she could think about. She had never written for young people, 
Porter pointed out, and had never really wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rowland persisted. Before long, Porter signed a contract with Rowland's 
Pleasant Company, agreeing to write six books about a courageous little girl 
named Addy. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the substantial, six-figure advance Porter received would make most 
fiction writers mutate into strange shades of green, the editorial constraints 
presented to Porter might have been tougher to take. 
</P>
<P>
 "The character was completely mapped out," Porter said. "They had even decided 
on an over-arching plot line." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Addy, an escaped slave, represented Pleasant Company's first venture 
into ethnic diversity, Porter was also working under the watchful eye of an 
advisory committee of historians, educators, museum directors and filmmakers. 
Like Porter -- and indeed like Addy -- all the committee members were African 
American. 
</P>
<P>
 But Porter liked the project. "I liked the approach to history that they were 
taking," she said. She thought the idea of meeting an African American family 
in the waning days of slavery and following the family to freedom in 
Philadelphia was an intriguing way to make a painful slice of the past come 
alive for young people. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was growing up, there were no books with African Americans in them," 
nevermind books about the slave experience, Porter said. Except, she recalled, 
for one brought home by one of her brothers featuring "happy slave girls 
dancing around the master." 
</P>
<P>
 So much for historical veracity, or a character an African American girl might 
want to identify with. 
</P>
<P>
 In 9-year-old Addy Walker, Porter wanted to create "a girl whose life is 
difficult -- she struggles, and not everything comes easily." Because "not 
everyone is a star pupil," Addy would be a girl who sometimes faltered in 
school. The Addy character would have "more of an edge" than the other American 
Girls produced by Pleasant Company. 
</P>
<P>
 Readers say she succeeded. "I shared Addy's pain, fear and yearning for 
freedom," said singer Melba Moore. The Rev. Willie Taplin Barrow, chairman of 
the board of Operation PUSH, hailed Addy as "one of America's bravest and 
brightest heroines." Journalist Barbara Reynolds, an editor at USA Today, 
praised Porter for making slavery "not just a history lesson, but an experience 
peopled with families and children whom we come to know and care about." 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt Porter, 35, brought a hefty dose of her own pluck to her fictional 
slave child. She was raised in a housing development outside Buffalo, the 
second youngest of nine children. Their father worked in the local steel mill, 
and the family shared a three-room apartment, as well as a sense of 
determination that saw most of the children finish college -- and many of them, 
graduate school. 
</P>
<P>
 Her family experience, in fact, bears a strong resemblance to the characters 
in "All-Bright Court" (Houghton Mifflin, 1991), the only novel Porter had 
published before she took on the "Addy" series. It was a review of "All-Bright 
Court" that piqued Rowland's interest in Porter. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Connie's imagination transcended her own experience," said Janet Silver, 
Porter's editor at Houghton Mifflin. The book did "quite well for a first 
novel," Silver said, selling between 10,000 and 15,000 copies in hardcover. The 
six-book "Addy" series, by contrast, has sold more than 1 million copies in the 
last six months. Book sales have long since surpassed Porter's generous 
advance, and now she takes home hefty royalty payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Very often, these figures strike Porter as amazing. She has continued to teach 
writing at Emerson College, a small private school here. She lives in an 
inner-city neighborhood and, when not riding the subway, drives a 4-year-old 
subcompact car that earned its huge dent the first week she owned it. 
</P>
<P>
 While marveling that "I don't think any of us knew how it would take off," 
Porter said the testimonials of 7- to 12-year-old girls -- her reading 
constituency -- are what most persuade her of her character's success. "One 
little black girl came running up to me, and she said, 'Wow! Here I am.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Porter believes that her character's resiliency accounts for a large part of 
her appeal. Fleeing from slavery in 1864 with her mother, Addy discovers "a 
strange kinda freedom" when the family arrives in the North. She encounters 
limitations that Porter contends strengthen Addy's credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted Addy to be an active child, but not a martyr," Porter said. "Her 
mother and father are not about to let her save the world." 
</P>
<P>
 But neither is Addy a victim. "We do a disservice to slaves if we look back at 
them as having had one-dimensional lives," Porter said. "You know, if we say, 
'Oh, poor, poor Addy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Julius Lester, a professor at the University of Massachusetts and the author 
of a number of children's books about slavery, lauded Porter for "humanizing a 
period of time and people who were subjected to something we still don't know 
how to deal with -- slavery." Many people, Lester said, "are still carrying 
shame around about this subject," and characters like Addy may help lift some 
misunderstandings. 
</P>
<P>
 Porter's use of dialect in the books has made some critics and readers 
uncomfortable. Some white parents report that they correct the grammar when 
they read aloud to their children, not wanting to support stereotypes of 
African American street talk. 
</P>
<P>
 But Porter said that "as a writer, I feel strongly that characters come to you 
in a certain way. I don't think they should be obliged to speak the way the 
audience does." In the mid-19th Century, she went on, "the dialect was 
extremely strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Addy was a Southerner with very little formal education, Porter 
observed, "I don't think she would have come up speaking Victorian English." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the Addy books are finished, Porter is at work on a novel she had 
postponed to take on this 2 1/2-year project. But the 9-year-old refuses to 
vanish from Porter's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's so real to me," Porter said, smiling, "that sometimes I dream about 
her."

MIKE PENNER: THEY'RE TRAPPED IN WEB OF CONFUSION 
</P>

<P>
 The San Diego Chargers have the ball, first and goal at the Ram nine-yard 
line, angling for the first points of the afternoon, and the San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium scoreboard implores: 
</P>
<P>
 QUIET PLEASE  
</P>
<P>
 AUDIBLE ZONE  
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have the ball at their 33, Chris Miller bounces a screen pass to 
Jerome Bettis, big third-down play coming up and a message board offers an 
advisory: 
</P>
<P>
 COMPLIMENTARY SUN BLOCK  
</P>
<P>
 AVAILABLE AT FIRST AID  
</P>
<P>
 A Charger fan, soaking in the atmosphere, wears a customized T-shirt bearing a 
simple exhortation. Not "Flock The Rams." Not "Crush Miller's Spleen." Just a 
gentle request, politely proposed: 
</P>
<P>
 "Protect Stan." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a friendly confine, San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. Here, they even 
refrained from booing Charger receiver Tony Martin Sunday until he dropped his 
second touchdown pass of the game. It's a feel-good, G-rated, 
family-entertainment environment, not counting those occasions when Junior Seau 
decides to dissect and re-assemble the anatomy of the visiting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams were duly impressed. Overwhelmed, in fact. Amid such outpouring of 
human kindness, the Rams must have felt a little nasty, a little tainted, for 
taking that 14-6 lead over the Chargers into halftime, because their final 30 
minutes on the field were devoted entirely to giving back to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have played 24 halves of football this season, most of them ugly, but 
none have been more wretched than Sunday's second half, when the Rams took an 
eight-point lead over the AFC West leaders, twisted it, mangled it and walked 
away 14-point losers. 
</P>
<P>
 Say this for the Rams, now 4-8 and bound for their fifth consecutive 
non-winning season: They're still losing as often as ever, but they're getting 
more creative about it. 
</P>
<P>
 First time the Rams touch the ball in the second half, they go three downs and 
out, punting deep to San Diego's Darrien Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon runs it back 75 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Second time the Rams touch the ball in the second half, Todd Kinchen returns a 
kickoff 99 yards into and beyond the Charger end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the field, some 30 yards away from the play, Ram Thomas 
Homco is flagged for holding and the score in nullified. 
</P>
<P>
 Second time the Chargers touch the ball in the second half, they drive to the 
Ram 10, where, on third down, Ram defensive backs Anthony Newman and Todd Lyght 
collide, allowing Ronnie Harmon to amble under Stan Humphries' easy touchdown 
lob. 
</P>
<P>
 Third time the Rams touch the ball in the second half, Chris Miller takes them 
to the Charger seven. On third and two, Miller rolls right on a bootleg, can 
keep rolling for the first down if he wants, but instead pulls up and abruptly 
flings the ball into the end zone -- hoping, as he later put it, for "Flipper 
(Anderson) to make a play." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon intercepts and runs it out to the Charger 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-two seconds later, the third quarter ends. Ram highlights during the 
final 15 minutes include a nifty cross-field overhand lateral-and-run, Kinchen 
to Lyght, that goes for big yards and is wiped out by a holding penalty; two 
Miller passes into the end zone that sail harmlessly out of the end zone; and 
the Rams' last two possessions ending in interceptions, bringing Miller's 
afternoon total to four. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not just losing, we are self-destructing," said an angry Darryl 
Henley, bobbing and weaving against the partitions of his locker stall. 
</P>
<P>
 Around him, no one was arguing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys are frustrated," Lyght said. "The guys are upset. You could see it 
when they walked into the locker room after the game, you could hear it, the 
things they were saying . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you see (the second half)? Unbelievable. How many times this year have we 
come out with a lead at halftime and not won the game?" 
</P>
<P>
 It has occurred only twice before, at Green Bay, at home against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 It only seems as if it happens every other week. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinchen's two play-of-the-day moments -- his wild ride through the Charger 
kickoff coverage unit, his long-distance lateral to Lyght (a tight enough 
spiral to move him to second on the quarterback depth chart) -- were 
obliterated by holding calls, never to see the light of CNN. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a while, we just got used to seeing the flags flying," Kinchen said. 
"By the end of the game, we were sick of them. That's why you didn't see us 
screaming at the referees. We got used to them, sadly enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The same goes for defeats on Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have gotten used to them, sadly enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "You keep asking yourself, 'Why?' " Miller said. "Why do we keep losing? Why 
do we do the things we do? I hate it." 
</P>
<P>
 Homco, guilty of the holding infraction that killed Kinchen's touchdown, 
simply seemed confused. First, he said, "The referee had to make that call. I 
got tangled up with (the Chargers' Doug Miller), we're both falling down and I 
grabbed him around the shoulders. The ref sees that, he has to call it." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Homco said the ref shouldn't have called it because "it was away from the 
play. It had nothing to do with the play." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Homco said, "Without playing any better, we could be 8-4. Without playing 
any better at all. But we're 4-8." 
</P>
<P>
 And another Ram season rolls into December down the road to oblivion, just 
another ball of confusion.

RAM NOTEBOOK; CHARGERS' MEANS BEATS BETTIS IN GROUND GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY and CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Natrone Means won the battle of the big backs Sunday, outgaining Ram tailback 
Jerome Bettis, 95 yards to 38 in the Chargers' 31-17 victory at San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis found it tough going against a Charger defense ranked fourth in the NFL 
in rush defense (85.2 yards per game). It was the seventh consecutive game in 
which Bettis has failed to reach 100 yards rushing, and he has rushed for only 
80 yards combined in the past three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we have the best front four in football," said defensive back Darrien 
Gordon, who had an interception and a 75-yard punt return for a touchdown. "We 
knew we would stop Bettis. We knew they were going to have to throw the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive tackle Jackie Slater, a 19-year veteran, passed an NFL milestone 
Sunday but it cost him some bruised ribs. Slater played in his 256th NFL game 
Sunday, moving past Earl Morrall into fourth place on the all-time 
participation list. 
</P>
<P>
 Slater left in the third quarter after a hit by San Diego's Chris Mims. Slater 
was blocking for a scrambling Chris Miller on the play, and was leveled by an 
airborne Mims after Miller was intercepted in the end zone by Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't see him coming," Slater said of Mims. "If I had, I would have gotten 
out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Was it a clean hit? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," he said. "It was clean." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Lyght's 27-yard punt return off a lateral from Todd Kinchen was a play 
straight out of the playbook of special teams coach Wayne Sevier from his days 
in Washington. Two years ago, the Redskins ran a similar play to then-rookie 
Desmond Howard, who scored a touchdown. Lyght's return was called back because 
of a holding penalty on David Lang. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had been working on that in practice," Kinchen said. "We had been watching 
old films of teams working on it, and we just put it in this week." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie defensive tackle D'Marco Farr reached another career milestone Sunday, 
returning his first kickoff on a short kick in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers were leading, 31-17, with 51 seconds left, and wanted to kick 
short to prevent a long return by deep backs Kinchen and David Lang, and 
figured Farr (6 feet 1 and 270 pounds) wasn't much of a return threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach told us to look for the squib kick," Farr said. "Before the kickoff, 
John Carney looked at me and smiled. I figured it was coming my way." 
</P>
<P>
 Farr rambled 16 yards before Stanley Richard tackled him at the Ram 45-yard 
line. It was the first time in Farr's career -- pro or college -- that he has 
returned a kick. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was there, 50 seconds left?" Farr said. "I could have returned it all 
the way, but by the time I got to the end zone, the clock would have run out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Jessie Hester extended his streak of games with at least one 
catch to 74 with a 40-yard touchdown reception from Miller in the first 
quarter. Hester had three catches for 81 yards at halftime, but caught only one 
pass for 14 yards in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We broke down in the second half," Hester said. "I ran a couple bad routes 
for the quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Vanhorse's 50-yard interception return for a touchdown did more than 
clinch the Chargers' victory. It answered that age-old question: What do I get 
my wife for our wedding anniversary? 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday was Vanhorse's first anniversary and his wife, Juliee, sent him to work 
with specific instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told me to go out and do something special for her today," Vanhorse said. 
"God really came through for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Vanhorse kept the ball to give to his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanhorse had an open field in front of him after intercepting the pass, but he 
wasn't home free. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw No. 72 (lineman Clarence Jones) coming," Vanhorse said. "I thought he 
was going to get me. I said, 'The boy is going to talk all week about it if he 
gets me.' I tried to pick it up." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Chargers' second-half rally got wide receiver Tony Martin off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin dropped two sure touchdown passes in the first half and heard about it 
from the fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you drop two touchdowns, it's going to be bad," Martin said. "It 
helps that we did win. If we came in here and lost, I would would have felt 
kind of bad." 
</P>
<P>
 And the fans' reaction? 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're doing good, they'll say you're the best," Martin said. "When 
you're bad, they'll boo you. I didn't really acknowledge it." Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's loss leaves the Rams 0-4 against California teams, including 
consecutive losses to the Raiders, San Francisco and the Chargers. . . . Strong 
safety Marquez Pope, acquired in a trade with the Chargers in the off-season, 
led the Rams in tackles with eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram injury report: Cornerback Wymon Henderson (groin), offensive tackle Jackie 
Slater (bruised ribs) and wide receiver Isaac Bruce (sprained knee). Bruce 
suffered what might be a serious knee injury and will undergo an MRI exam 
today. Defensive tackle Jimmie Jones played despite a twisted right ankle. San 
Diego injuries: Tight end Duane Young (groin) and strong safety Darren 
Carrington (ankle).

HE'S FINALLY READY TO MAKE OWN WAY; BASKETBALL: FINNERANS HAVE LEFT SANTA 
MARGARITA, AND BRENDAN MULLIGAN HOPES TO FILL VOID -- AND MAYBE MAKE PEOPLE 
FORGET WHO HIS SISTER IS, TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SPINN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A competitive nature develops quickly when your sister is better than you are. 
</P>
<P>
 Brendan Mulligan knows this. He's lived through it. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the top players in the Sea View League, it's hard to imagine that 
the Santa Margarita senior ever lost too often in games of H-O-R-S-E or 
one-on-one . . . especially to his sister.  
</P>
<P>
 But Mulligan's older sister, Kristen, was a three-time All-Southern Section 
first-team selection and the 1992 Southern Section Division I Player of the 
Year at Palos Verdes Peninsula after leading Peninsula to an unbeaten season 
and the State Division I championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Kristen is a starting junior guard at Auburn. In the past, she was 
Brendan's archrival. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was 11 or 12, I'd go to the gym with Kristen, and people would say, 
'Oh, you're Kristen Mulligan's little brother,' " Brendan said. "That gave me 
the fire to work hard and get better, so I wouldn't always be known as 
Kristen's brother." 
</P>
<P>
 In those pre-high school years, he was frequently known as his sister's 
favorite victim in shooting contests and one-on-one challenges. But as his 
defeats mounted, so did his determination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to be better than her, so I just kept playing all the time and 
working on things so I could beat her," Mulligan said. "Especially since she's 
a girl . . . that's hard for a brother to live with, having your sister beat 
you in something athletic." 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't have to live with it anymore. For one thing, brother and sister 
don't compete against each other much these days -- "too many altercations," 
Brendan says, laughing -- and for another, he definitely doesn't qualify as 
"Kristen Mulligan's little brother" anywhere except in the family tree. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 feet 3, Mulligan plays forward and guard for the Eagles, who won the 
Southern Section Division III-AA championship last year. As Santa Margarita's 
season progressed, Mulligan began to stand out as a player who stepped up to 
meet challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's his mentality; he loves the competition," Santa Margarita Coach Jerry 
DeBusk said. "He's not one to ever shy away from challenges or be intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
 "In one of our games against University last year, Demetrius Ziegler (the 
county's leading scorer) was just scoring at will, and I asked our guys if 
there was one player on the team who could shut this guy down, and Brendan 
raised his hand and said, 'Coach, put me on him.' Whatever we need done, he's 
willing to try." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, most Santa Margarita opponents keyed on Brian and Brad Finneran, 
the Eagles' leading scorers and rebounders. After a tentative early season, 
Mulligan realized that, with opponents focusing on the Finnerans, opportunities 
existed. A strong game against Woodbridge in the Sea View League opener boosted 
Mulligan's confidence, and when Brian Finneran fractured a bone in his foot 
midway through league play, Santa Margarita needed Mulligan to step up 
permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Brian hurt his foot, we knew we'd all have to turn it up another notch 
and keep it there," Mulligan said, "and by that time I had the confidence that 
I could play at that level." 
</P>
<P>
 Mulligan finished the regular season strong, earning second team all-league 
honors, and then capped an impressive performance in the section playoffs by 
scoring 16 points in the Division III-AA championship victory over Servite. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the Finnerans have graduated, and Mulligan will have new challenges 
to meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now Brendan's going to be the guy and everyone knows it, but he's been there 
and he's experienced," DeBusk said. "He's our captain and he accepts his 
leadership role well. The other guys know he's not going to back down." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course not. That'd be worse than losing to your sister in H-O-R-S-E.

<P>
 Don't expect Santa Margarita to have to rebuild too much after last season's 
Southern Section Division III-AA championship, despite the loss of all-county 
forwards Brian and Brad Finneran. The Eagles return Mulligan and Keane, and 
DeBusk expects Krist to be one of the league's most-improved players. "Allen 
really hit the weights, and you can see the improvement in his strength and 
stamina," DeBusk said. Mulligan was a second-team all-league selection last 
season (12.6 point average) and DeBusk expects him to be the leader on the 
floor. Keane also returns with a year of starting experience, and the remainder 
of the Eagle lineup will come primarily from a junior varsity team that went 
23-2.

VAUGHN WISE BEYOND HER YEARS ON COURT; TENNIS: FRESHMAN HAS A STRONG MENTAL 
APPROACH TO THE GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 14, Corona del Mar's Nina Vaughan is all legs, bones and -- as her older 
opponents are quickly learning -- all brains. 
</P>
<P>
 Having grown five inches in the last year, Vaughan is struggling to gain speed 
and a net game to take advantage of her 5-foot-8 frame. But Vaughan proved last 
Saturday in the Southern Section individual sectionals that she is not afraid 
to think on her big feet. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking an easy one-set lead, Vaughan felt the match slipping away to her 
best friend, Michelle Bray of Laguna Beach, who was feeling her oats and 
hitting winners past a stationary Vaughan. 
</P>
<P>
 So what does she do? She slows the pace by hitting moon balls to frustrate 
Bray. It wasn't pretty, and it wasn't too polite, but it was effective and it 
got her into the round of 16 in one of Southern California's most prestigious 
girls' tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Is anyone surprised? 
</P>
<P>
 "She never ceases to amaze me," said Vaughan's mother, Debra Russell. 
</P>
<P>
 But Steve Weire, Vaughan's private coach of two years, was somewhat amazed 
when he heard about his crafty student's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe it when I read about Nina hitting all those moon balls," 
Weire said. "She could have never done that two years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Weire said Vaughan couldn't do much except hit the ball as hard as she could. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a hard hitter, but she didn't know how to win matches," said Weire, 
who played college tennis at Northern Illinois and recently won the Southern 
California Sectional championship in the men's open division. "She won on her 
talent, but not on her brainpower. I guess she used up all her brains in class, 
because she didn't have any on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've just tried to get her to think about the game, play every point like 
it's your last point." 
</P>
<P>
 What Vaughan has always had, according to her mother, is tremendous drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just in tennis," Russell said. "Nina is an overachiever in 
everything. She's a 4.0 student who's on the principal's honor roll, and she's 
taking all sophomore classes." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan acknowledges that she's a workaholic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I play about every day for a couple hours, but I usually take a day or two 
off after tournaments," said Vaughan, who took up tennis at the age of 8 on the 
advice of her stepfather, Hal Russell. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Vaughan's work ethic, Debra Russell said her daughter would not be 
ranked sixth among 14-year-olds in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tennis did not come naturally to her," said Debra Russell, who credits 
Vaughan's first coach, Sam Olson, for giving her daughter a solid foundation in 
tennis. "That's what floors everybody. She's put in double and triple time to 
be where she is." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Vaughan's younger sister, Nadia, puts in about half the time and is 
one of the top-ranked 12-year-olds in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's totally different than me," Nina said. "She's got more muscle, she 
comes to the net and she's got a lot of power. She's taken some sets off me, 
but she's never beaten me in a real match." 
</P>
<P>
 Debra Russell said her daughters' matches are painful to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It brings out the best in Nadia and the worst in Nina," she said. "Nina gets 
all tight and tense, and all Nadia wants to do is beat her older sister." 
</P>
<P>
 Only four players have defeated Nadia's older sister this season in team dual 
matches, Newport Harbor's Sarah Hawkins, Woodbridge's Natalie Exon twice and 
Laguna Beach's Amanda Hastings-Phillips. Vaughan said she even surprised 
herself by winning 51 of 55 sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew there would be tough competition," she said. "We're in one of the 
toughest leagues (the Sea View), so I didn't expect to do as well as I did. The 
players are a lot more experienced, and they hit and serve a lot harder than I 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 And Vaughan concedes, most are faster than her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never quick to begin with," she said. "It's been tough. Speed wasn't 
one of my gifts and now that I've grown so fast, I'm even slower. I've lost 
countless matches because my opponent's been faster or in better condition than 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 But Vaughan said that might soon change when she begins working with a 
personal trainer on her quickness and endurance. She hopes quicker feet, will 
bring an improved net game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm OK once I'm at the net, it's getting there that's the problem," she said. 
"My transition game isn't too good. It's tough bending over for the approach 
shots and then following them in fast enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Weire: "In practice, she's got a great net game. If she can get a big 
serve behind that, we've got her." 
</P>
<P>
 But until she gets her entire package together, Vaughan will continue trying 
to outsmart and outwork her opponents, something Vaughan realizes will be a 
tough trick on Thursday at the Lindborg Racquet Club, where the section 
individual singles tournament takes place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just going to say a prayer that I can win one match," said Vaughan, who 
spent Thanksgiving in St. Louis playing in the girls' 14 national indoor 
tournament. "That's going to be tough tennis. That's the best of the best."

HOT JOBS: BELLMAN POSITION HELPS KEEP HIM ON HIS FEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOPE HAMASHIGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When he moved to California from Alexandria, Va., Doug Wood did not seek out a 
job as a hotel bellman. 
</P>
<P>
 But 11 years later, Wood calls himself a "lifer" because he plans to stay in 
this line of work for the rest of his life. Wood said his job as a bellman at 
the Westin South Coast Plaza hotel in Costa Mesa suits his lifestyle -- he 
meets a lot of people, gets to work in a beautiful environment and enjoys free 
rooms at Westin hotels when he goes on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This job fits my needs because I am hyperactive and I get to always be on my 
feet," he said. He also likes that his job is truly one that is 9 to 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "You work hard and go home and you don't take your work home with you," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 But things can get tough during those eight hours. "There are times when, for 
example, a meeting breaks and everyone wants their bags taken down at the same 
time and we get very busy," Wood said, "because a hotel like this is supposed 
to be able to provide instantaneous service." 
</P>
<P>
 And taking care of those needs can be physically demanding. Wood said that he 
walks up to 10 miles a day and lifts a lot of heavy luggage. He suggests that 
anyone interested in such a job be in good physical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Though satisfying guests is an ongoing challenge, the reward comes at the end 
of the day when he is counting his tips. "The harder I work, the more money I 
make in tips," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to generate big tips is to be full of information. In addition to 
their luggage, most guests have questions about local restaurants, shops and 
interesting excursions. "You have to be able to give good directions and have 
good communications skills," Wood said. OCCUPATION: BELLMAN  
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: Bellmen carry hotel guests' luggage to and from their 
rooms. They are also responsible for driving hotel limousines to and from the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualifications: There are no educational requirements to be a bellman. 
Applicants must be in good physical shape because the job involves heavy 
lifting and lots of walking. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: By 1998, the number of bellmen in the county is projected to 
increase by 18.4% to 450. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: Most bellmen earn minimum wage plus tips. The bellmen are 
unionized at some hotels and they are paid higher than minimum wage and receive 
greater benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: It is an active job and appeals to anyone who enjoys a good workout. 
Another benefit is the beautiful hotel and resort environment in which bellmen 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: Trying to assist angry or disgruntled customers can often be 
challenging. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement: There are possibilities of moving into other positions in the 
hotel industry. Some bellmen can make lateral moves to work in other guest 
services. Others may opt to move into hotel management. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "You meet a wide variety of people. Sometimes it is like walking into 
the lobby of the United Nations here."

SCREENING ROOM: 'PROPHECY' OFFERS IDEAS, UPLIFT, NO CONCLUSIONS

 Veteran Canadian documentarian Harry Rasky's "Prophecy" (Sunset 5, Saturdays 
and Sundays at 11 a.m.) is a kind of peripatetic diary-film, rich in ideas but 
also decidedly rambling, in which he moves away from the usual apocalyptic 
connotations of prophecy to discover many of the world's religions linked by a 
common message of hope. 
</P>
<P>
 He spends a great deal of time in Jerusalem, sacred to Judaism, Christianity 
and Islam, yet does not delve into how these three religions might find 
harmony.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides conversations with various religious leaders and thinkers, there are 
chats with economist John Kenneth Galbraith and former Soviet dissident Natan 
Sharansky. 
</P>
<P>
 Look to "Prophecy" for intelligent spiritual and intellectual uplift but not 
for any conclusions on Rasky's part.

 A Family of Laughs: The Goethe Institute, 5700 Wilshire Blvd., gets its 
"German Comedy: East Meets West" series off to a good start Tuesday at 7 p.m. 
with Peter Timm's lively 1990 comedy "Go, Trabi, Go." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfgang Stumph stars as a likable scholar of German literature in the former 
East German industrial town of Bitterfeld who takes off on a vacation with his 
wife (Marie Gruber) and sexy teen-age daughter (Claudia Schmutzler) in their 
17-year-old Trabant, the GDR's ubiquitous, inexpensive car. With reunification 
he'll now fulfill his dream of retracing Goethe's "Italian Journey," spanning 
Munich to Naples.  
</P>
<P>
 "Go, Trabi, Go" is a broad, commercial comedy in the best sense, but Timm 
manages to skewer West German condescension toward East Germans before sending 
off the family to foreign adventures. By the time this delightful film is over 
we realize that these people are as admirably resilient as their car.

 Short Films: Cinewomen, a nonprofit organization for the advancement of women 
in the entertainment industry, is launching a series of screenings Wednesday at 
7:30 p.m. at the American Film Institute's Mark Goodson Theater with an 
outstanding program of short films.

 If you can get past the idea of an adolescent being allowed to deliver mail, 
Debrah LeMattre's 30-minute "Underwater" is an exceptional accomplishment, 
marked by a fluid, rhythmic style, graceful camera work (by Denise Brassard) 
and a sense of intimacy and insight. LeMattre convincingly takes us into the 
troubled, alienated psyche of a girl of perhaps 12 (Sabrina Chateau), haunted 
by a memory of incest, who is forced to come to terms with her past in order to 
help another. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Udelson's hilarious 30-minute "The Party Favor" pokes fun at the bridal 
shower ritual but has an unexpected payoff when the bride's sister-in-law-to-be 
(Wendle Josepher) brings along her lover (Heidi Swedberg). 
</P>
<P>
 Although awfully heavy on Angst , Sharyn Blumenthal's 30-minute "The Poet's 
Wife" benefits strongly from the radiant presence of Rachel Levin as a 
documentary filmmaker whose probing of the lives of a deceased poet and his 
wife confronts her with the uncertainty of her own relationship with her 
married partner (Stanley Kamel). 
</P>
<P>
 Lea Zagury's 13-minute "Karaiba" is a dazzling work of imaginative animation 
in a sophisticated folk art style that protests the destruction of the Amazon 
rain forest in a playful, witty fashion, which puts its message across all the 
more effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Aired on MTV's "No Alternative" benefit, Tamra Davis' 6-minute "No Alternative 
Girls" presents the views of several of the most popular female rock stars 
today -- including Courtney Love, no less -- on sex, sexuality and liberation; 
for them there's no alternative to safe sex.

THEATER REVIEW; 'GLORY' IS SHEER SPECTACLE, IF NOT SHEER POETRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Ben Jonson and Inigo Jones meshed talents for the word and image with 
their spectacular 17th-Century masques for the English court, they made some of 
the first movies.  
</P>
<P>
 They were also anticipating a show such as "The Glory of Christmas" at the 
Crystal Cathedral, which, after 13 years, must surely rank among the most 
grandiose religious masques anywhere. Jonson and Jones could only dream, for 
instance, of the tricks pulled off by Flying by Foy, that ubiquitous outfit 
responsible for getting the show's many hovering angels off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, architect and designer Jones would be dazzled -- dazzled by the 
towering, twinkling night sky over Charles Lisanby's set of Bethlehem; by the 
thunderous lightning storm before Jesus' birth; by those flying angels (the 
first sight of which outdoes the same stunt in "Angels in America" for sheer 
theatrical wonder), and by the baroque decor and more than 200 peasants, 
dancers, Magi, horses, donkeys, centurions, camels and sheep. This is the 
religious masque with a passion for excess. This re-creation of the Nativity 
also features 17 musical numbers and what is billed as one of the largest 
indoor sets in the world: 80 feet high and 124 feet across, with five miles of 
steel undergirding. 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright Jonson, on the other hand, would not be so pleased. Though the 
masques and passion plays strove for a balance between image and word, 
writer-director Paul David Dunn's show is all dazzle, and little thought. While 
we don't want psycho-dramas made of our pageants, the sheer spectacle certainly 
needs some poetry.  
</P>
<P>
 Alas, in "The Glory of Christmas," whenever an actor says a word, it's almost 
like scenery tumbling down. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of this is due to the huge, audible disparity between the enormous cast's 
pros and amateurs. While pro Arthur C. (Buddy) Adler grandly devours the 
scenery as the evil King Herod, his Roman lieutenants sound like guys showing 
up for a costume party. As a plot to murder the newborn holy child, Herod's 
discussion doesn't sound serious.  
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, when Joseph and Mary (alternately played by pros Tod Fitzpatrick 
and Bruce Johnson and Bobbi Candler and Virenia Lind) press an innkeeper (Don 
Eyer, alternating with Chris Blanas) for lodging, Eyer makes it feel like he's 
a gas-station attendant giving directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the dialogue here is at a minimum. The dominant spoken words 
emerge, as it were, from above, with narrator Thurl Ravenscroft's (recorded) 
stentorian voice. His narrative links between scenes avoid the hokey until the 
end, when Jesus' remaining 30-plus years are summed up in about one minute. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of the narration and the gigantic effects (care of Rick Helgason) 
tends to rub against the utterly humble conditions of Jesus' birth, but it has 
also made "The Glory of Christmas" very high on the must-see list for 
out-of-town relatives -- even if they're nonbelievers. And you can tell them 
that this spectacle far outstrips almost anything at nearby Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Where "Glory," however, can't match Disneyland for wowing the crowd is pacing. 
Though just a touch over an hour, Dunn's staging too often grows static, 
particularly during the oddly mixed program of new songs and old carols. For 
those of us who love tableaux staging, this show is a great feast (climaxing 
with the populous "Adoration of the Magi"). But tableaux -- and the cathedral's 
enormous stage -- requires time to set up, and here, it seems to require a 
great deal of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, so do Masses and other rituals. Taken as something between 
Hollywood and a rite, "Glory" remains a unique fusion of theater and the 
devotional, a high-tech masque in a huge glass church. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Glory of Christmas," Crystal Cathedral, 12141 Lewis St., Garden Grove.

 Taking a Gamble on Gumbel?: What will be the fate of "Today" host Bryant 
Gumbel? An industry source told Newsday that Gumbel, whose NBC contract ends 
this week, has received a major offer from Fox. Details of the package are 
unknown -- except that Fox is very eager to land him and most likely wants him 
to headline its new untitled late-night news program, scheduled to air this 
season. As reported several weeks ago, Fox was expected to make a play for 
Gumbel because of the late-night project. But what does Gumbel want? The host, 
adept at the art of negotiating in the newspapers, told USA Today he'll 
"certainly sign with someone." Gumbel always has said he didn't want to leave 
"Today" until it was back on top, which it is. But he's also something of a 
homebody, who has spent most of his career at NBC. Gumbel and Fox executives 
could not be reached for comment.

 They're No Rejects: They couldn't get seats for David Letterman's show, but 
they did sit down to Thanksgiving dinner -- courtesy of Letterman. A group of 
19 people -- strangers until being rejected in the ticket line for CBS' "Late 
Show With David Letterman" last week -- were sent on an impromptu, 
all-expenses-paid trip to Miami by the talk-show host. On Thursday, the group 
was treated to turkey dinner with dressing and grits at the Hyatt Regency. Then 
they greeted Letterman on his show. MOVIES

 Hey Oscar, It's Felix: French filmmaker Robert Bresson was honored for his 
life's work by the European Film Academy on Sunday in Berlin. Actor Max von 
Sydow led the presentation of the 1994 Felix awards, an event that began seven 
years ago as the European answer to the Academy Awards. Bresson's films include 
"Pickpocket" (1959), "The Trial of Joan of Arc" (1962) and "L'Argent," for 
which he won the Grand Prix at Cannes in 1983. The Felix for best film went to 
Gianni Amelio's "Lamerica," from Italy. The prize for best movie by a young 
filmmaker went to France's Agnes Merlet for "Le Fils du Requin" and Hungary's 
Janos Szasz for "Woyzeck."

 The King Logs Off: Elvis has left the Internet. A computer system at the 
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was home for almost a year to the 
"Elvis Home Page," a billboard accessible through the SunSITE destination on 
the Internet. Fans could access sound clips of Elvis Presley's recordings, 
photos and even a "Cyber Graceland Tour" with images of the King's Memphis 
home. The free billboard was taken off line this month at the request of the 
Presley estate's attorneys because it included copyrighted material. A lawyer 
said the estate might want to do its own version of Elvis in cyberspace in the 
future. QUICK TAKES

JAZZ REVIEW; KIKUYA BECOMES FILLING-IN STATION FOR GUERRERO AND COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you turned up at Kikuya Restaurant here Saturday night in the hopes of 
hearing cornetist Bill Berry play and were disappointed, you had plenty of 
company. Even the rhythm section arrived thinking they'd be backing the Duke 
Ellington veteran and leader of the Bill Berry L.A. Big Band. 
</P>
<P>
 But Berry, who canceled earlier on the day of the performance, was home in 
North Hollywood feeling under the weather. Also missing was guitarist Doug 
MacDonald's trio, which had ducked out several days earlier because of a 
scheduling conflict. MacDonald had found a replacement trio, but, because of 
the last-minute nature of Berry's cancellation, even they had no idea that 
veteran jazzman wouldn't show -- at least not until Berry's replacement, 
trumpeter-fluegelhornist Tony Guerrero arrived on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 If that didn't make this date a spontaneous enough affair, the fact that most 
of the quartet had never met made the chances of success even more unlikely. 
Though everyone in the group seemed to know bassist Harry Smith, it was the 
first time Guerrero, drummer Joe Correro Jr. and pianist Jimmy Dykes had met. 
</P>
<P>
 As the group assembled on the bandstand, we couldn't help but recall a concert 
held about 20 years ago in Minneapolis. Drummer Buddy Miles was to be the 
headliner and the small university district club was filled with fans. But when 
it came time for Miles to make an appearance, the person who came out was 
someone entirely different. Granted, this impostor was portly like Miles and 
topped with an impressive Afro, though it looked to be a wig. But when he sat 
down at the drum set, well. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd at that show responded with boos before chasing the phony Miles from 
the stage and trashing the establishment. Luckily, there was no such behavior 
at Kikuya. And for good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero put the audience at ease early on as he deadpanned, "You probably 
heard that Bill Berry would be playing here tonight. Well, we'll do anything to 
draw a crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 And anyone who had turned up at the club to hear a sound set of jazz was not 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 The put-together nature of the affair limited the material to the familiar 
standards as the four new friends sought common ground. But each tune, no 
matter how familiar, was given plenty of personality as the foursome projected 
their own identities while establishing a musical whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero led the way in developing different types of character as he worked 
on muted and open trumpet and fluegelhorn. There were moody, Miles Davis 
references in his muted playing and plenty of be-bop and blues inflections, 
especially on an up-tempo version of "My Secret Love." 
</P>
<P>
 His fluegelhorn work compared less favorably, notably on "Paper Moon." But 
slow the tempo down, as he did on "My Romance," and the warm, intimate nature 
of the larger instrument came through. With plunger mute, he developed a range 
of growls, snarling blues phrases and wah-wah effects that were appropriate to 
the Thelonious Monk material he was playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Pianist Dykes and bassist Smith both made strong impressions. Each is a 
capable soloist with an ear for the melodic, and both showed a knack for 
developing a story line. Drummer Correro played to a tune's dynamics, stirring 
up fine backing with his brushes while soloing in a direct, to-the-beat style. 
</P>
<P>
 You wouldn't expect everything to fit together perfectly, given the 
come-together nature of this performance. 
</P>
<P>
 But the play went smoothly, with only few exceptions as a solo wandered on too 
long or the four looked for a way to gracefully close a tune.  
</P>
<P>
 If jazz is the music of spontaneity, then this was a very jazzy session 
indeed.

THEATER; IN THE END, 'LOVE!' PRAYERS ARE ANSWERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nathan Lane has had several great roles in his career -- from Mendy, the 
hilarious opera queen in Terrence McNally's "Lisbon Traviata," to Nathan 
Detroit in "Guys and Dolls," to Timon, the wise-cracking meerkat in "The Lion 
King" -- but he has never had a role as full of humor and pain as he does in 
"Love! Valour! Compassion!" 
</P>
<P>
 In the new McNally play at the Manhattan Theatre Club, Lane plays Buzz Hauser, 
a musical comedy fanatic who can always find a suitable quote from "Annie Get 
Your Gun" or "Guys and Dolls" to pepper his already animated conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 Honed by a lifetime of theater-going, Buzz's ebullience is a tonic of 
immeasurable value for him and for the seven gay friends who gather in the 
country house of Gregory (Stephen Bogardus), an aging choreographer with a 
generous spirit, for three holidays one summer. Two of the men are dying, and 
the rest have their share of troubles too. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Love! Valour! Compassion!" McNally takes a leap in developing the hybrid 
style with which he began experimenting in "Lips Together, Teeth Apart." 
McNally's experiment is akin to Eugene O'Neill's in "Strange Interlude" but 
less pretentious, with a voice that fluctuates amid first-person narration, 
internal monologue and realistic, if flatly stated, dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stylistically, McNally seems influenced by the simple poetry of children's 
bedtime stories. "All in all, there was a lot of love in Gregory and Bobby's 
house that night, on the first holiday weekend of the summer," is a typical 
sentence in the narration, which is passed from character to character like a 
baton throughout the evening. The play's intermittently cloying tone extends 
beyond the narration. One character thanks God "for the sweet, sweet air and 
all of us together in Gregory's house." 
</P>
<P>
 The play's gentle, almost sing-songy voice is an interesting counterpoint to 
the characters' frank expressions of desire for the nude male form, which 
several of the characters display without being asked. Almost as prominent 
among these characters is the yearning for all-encompassing love, an urgent 
need in the atmosphere of fragile mortality that continues to define the gay 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Buzz begins as the only unattached man in the country house. He is dying, and 
his need to be loved cuts sharply and clearly through all of this particular 
summer's many anguishes. Lane's perfect timing has to be seen to be believed, 
and Buzz's every line seems a perfectly polished comedic gem. (Did McNally give 
him all the best lines, or does it just seem that way?) Similar to but more 
fleshed out than the hyper and wildly funny character Lane played in "Lisbon 
Traviata," Buzz fears his intensity drives men away. "They say, 'What's your 
rush,' (I) say, 'What's your delay?'," he explains with an increasingly 
combustible anxiety that can take him to the brink of hysteria in the space of 
one sentence. He wonders if maybe he should be dating "someone like Dennis 
Hopper." 
</P>
<P>
 Buzz loves musical comedy, believes that everyone is gay and exhibits a 
partially put-on paranoia about heterosexuals ("There's too God-damned many of 
them. I was in the bank yesterday -- they're everywhere!") While he is too 
witty to be a stereotype, Buzz is emblematic of a certain sensibility, his 
humor fueled by the desperation and anger of someone always made to feel like 
he's surviving rather than simply living. In Buzz, McNally personalizes the 
devastation of AIDS on the gay community, because you feel how profound the 
loss of this person will be to his friends and to anyone with a sense of humor 
who comes in contact with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, however, McNally does not so much personalize as externalize the 
characters' anguish. One character cries out his pain: "It's all so (expletive) 
fragile. It's so arbitrary." Watching the police bash gay protesters on the TV 
news, another character exclaims, "What is wrong with this country? They hate 
us; they always have. It never ends, the (expletive) hatred." While people do, 
of course, talk like this, one can't help feeling that McNally could evoke his 
characters' anguish more if he didn't spell it out quite so baldly. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Joe Mantello has orchestrated the play's many moods with great 
fluidity, and the ensemble of gifted actors feels, looks and sounds like a true 
community, with all its shifting loyalties and furies. Especially good are 
Bogardus, as the spiritual center of this household and Justin Kirk as Bobby, a 
young blind man torn between his love for the aging choreographer and a need 
for experience outside the safety of Gregory's devotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing the twins James and John Jeckyll, John Glover runs into trouble while 
carrying the burden of the play's most schematic device. His James, the good 
twin, is a fussy grandmother complete with glasses low on nose and a high, 
trilling voice. Meanwhile, the malicious John roams the house reading Gregory's 
journal in a masochistic exercise to find out he is disliked by even the most 
generous of the men, exhibiting a transparent and predictable need to be loved 
at the foundation of this character. Glover cannot rescue James and John from 
cheesy theatricality. 
</P>
<P>
 McNally has not made every character as seamless and believable as Lane's 
Buzz, who rails against his impending death by attacking what he loves most -- 
the call to survival and joy that is the Broadway musical. "I want to see a 
'Sound of Music' where the entire Von Trapp family dies," he exclaims, refusing 
to be calmed. 
</P>
<P>
 But we get to see another side of Buzz, when he at long last finds, in James, 
a love that allows him to give all of himself. As they dance, his head rests 
against James' shoulder and his antic features relax in a momentary peace. His 
release blankets the theater like the deepest balm imaginable. Dancing nearby, 
Perry (Stephen Spinella) notices, and mutters, "Look -- answered prayers." 
Indeed, at that moment all prayers are answered -- for Buzz and for audiences 
alike.

COUNTERPUNCH: ACCESS IS WHAT COUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MURRAY WHITE, Murray White, who works at the American Enterprise Institute 
in Washington, specializes in the popularization of Old Master paintings. His 
articles on Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Rembrandt have appeared in such 
publications as the Washington Post and the Baltimore Sun. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Christopher Knight's heart is obviously in the right place when he bemoans the 
fact that the UCLA/Armand Hammer Museum, as the result of a recent auction, 
allowed a Leonardo da Vinci manuscript to slip "from the public realm into 
private hands," which happen to be those of billionaire Bill Gates ("The Hammer 
Falls on the Public's Trust," Calendar, Nov. 15). Knight's memorable phrasing 
of this development -- " 'We' had owned it, now 'he' owns it" -- depicts an 
undeniably accurate reality, but he seems to be overly pessimistic in assuming 
that this is inherently a bad thing.  
</P>
<P>
 The standards by which stewardship of great art ought to be evaluated have 
nothing to do with whether it is owned by the public or by a private entity. 
They have everything to do with how the art is used. For instance, there are 
thousands of artworks in storage in public museums all across this nation that 
are rarely, if ever, on public view due to space limitations. Some of these 
objects would arguably serve the public better if they belonged to enlightened 
private collectors who periodically had school groups or interested citizens 
out to their house to study and savor them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of a Leonardo collector will Bill Gates turn out to be? The first 
signs are very encouraging: He has agreed to lend the manuscript to the 
Milan-based bank that had bid against him in the hopes of returning the 
document to the artist's native Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other things Gates could do to help the public reap the vast amounts of 
wisdom and beauty that reside in the manuscript include the following: 
</P>
<P>
 * Organize a long-term national tour in which the manuscript is displayed in 
specially constructed art-viewing pavilions in inner-city neighborhoods. This 
would bring one of Western civilization's crowning accomplishments to those 
neglected citizens most in need of the edification that it can provide. 
</P>
<P>
 * Produce television documentaries and children's programs, including those 
that feature computerized animations of some of the 300 drawings in the 
manuscript. 
</P>
<P>
 * Produce educational packets on Leonardo, the Renaissance and art history in 
general for elementary and secondary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hire an army of art history graduate students and teachers who, like an art 
world Peace Corps, would spread the gospel of Leonardo-esque principles of 
beauty and knowledge through lectures, articles and conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken together, these endeavors, which could easily be augmented by the Getty 
Trust's vast public education programs, could turn Leonardo into a "hip" figure 
adored by all levels of the populace. If done correctly, Gates could trigger a 
national craze -- "Leonardomania." 
</P>
<P>
 The Renaissance, of which Leonardo was such a towering figure, came about in 
the 14th Century in Europe as the result of a reawakened interest in the 
glories and culture of ancient Greece. Gates could launch a new renaissance, a 
Neo-Renaissance, by reawakening interest in Leonardo and his peers. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodness knows he has the wealth and technical proficiency to pull off 
something on this grand a scale. If this modern-day Medici has the will to give 
it a try, he would prove beyond a doubt that a private citizen who owns an art 
masterpiece can do just as much to help society as any publicly run museum.

COUNTERPUNCH: 'ER': L.A. COUNTY SHOULD HAVE IT SO GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL W. WALLACE, Dr. Paul W. Wallace is a Beverly Hills physician 
specializing in dermatologic plastic surgery. He is also executive director of 
the Los Angeles County Joint Council of Interns and Residents, which represents 
2,000 physicians in training in Los Angeles County public hospitals. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Enough already. The new television series "ER" is a nighttime drama that is 
exciting, fast-paced and emotionally charged. It is not (repeat not) a medical 
training documentary. It airs on NBC, not on educational TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike a documentary, a television drama does not necessarily mirror real 
life. "ER" is a weekly series and, as such, has the luxury of being 
entertaining rather than providing a precise exposition of emergency room 
medical procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Most emergency room doctors who have critiqued the television show "ER" have 
approached it with the fervor of someone protecting his religious doctrine. 
They condemn the TV series as blasphemous. 
</P>
<P>
 I trained in a Los Angeles County hospital with one of America's busiest 
emergency rooms. I find that "ER" captures the reality of the rapid-pace, 
critical decision-making process and interpersonal relationships between 
colleagues, subordinates and patients in a county hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, medically speaking, "ER" has some technical problems, but only those who 
work in the hospital environment would recognize them. In some hospitals, 
betting pools are set up every week to guess the number of small medical 
mistakes that will occur on "ER." To the public, any medical misrepresentations 
are indistinguishable. In fact, "ER" is a vast improvement over "Marcus Welby, 
M.D.," who commonly read X-rays upside down. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Gerald P. Whelan's scathing review of "ER" ("Put 'ER' Out of Its Misery -- 
Quickly," Counterpunch, Oct. 3) alleges that it is a lie being perpetrated upon 
the American people that emergency rooms are staffed by unsupervised resident 
physicians. He further stated that "all care is supervised 24 hours a day." 
However, the fact of the matter is that just a few months ago, one of L.A. 
County's ERs was threatened with closure due to lack of supervision. Many other 
training programs have been reprimanded and cited by the accrediting 
authorities for the same types of problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to Dr. Whelan's view, "ER" shows a working environment and conditions 
-- though comparable to most hospitals -- that far exceed those of the Los 
Angeles County public hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from degrading the actual conditions of a public hospital, there are 
conveniences shown in "ER" that we wish we could have in real life. For 
example, the television "ER" doctors get units of blood and lab results almost 
instantaneously. On the other hand, one L.A. County hospital has its blood 
bank, which is frequently unstaffed and lacking sufficient supplies, a 
quarter-mile from its emergency room. Many laboratories discontinue operations 
at 4 p.m. and tests cannot be run until the next working day. Or, even worse, 
some lab work is only conducted once a week. Compared to "ER," L.A. County is a 
MASH unit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One luxury afforded the "ER" doctors is a lounge with bright lights, couches 
or pool tables. Unlike these doctors, the L.A. County residents in training 
have neither sufficient dormitories nor on-call rooms in which to rest between 
crises. 
</P>
<P>
 One subtle point made by the TV series is that the working conditions are 
unsafe. Prior to the time that three doctors got shot at USC Medical Center 
last year, access to even the most critical areas of county hospitals was wide 
open. In Los Angeles County waiting rooms and/or while patients are being 
examined in the critical care rooms, guns, knives and other weapons are 
frequently removed from visitors and patients. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that residency training programs for emergency medicine require, by 
regulation, no more than 12-hour shifts with two days off per week. However, 
arrival at the emergency room is only the beginning of a patient's journey 
through their hospital course. Unless the patient is dead on arrival, the 
"buck" does not stop at the ER. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency medicine interns and residents are not the only physicians who work 
in the emergency room. Pediatricians, orthopedists, general surgeons and other 
specialists often do not have the luxury of going home after a regular 12-hour 
shift. They are the doctors responsible for the care of a multitude of patients 
throughout their entire hospital stay and must provide definitive continuity of 
care until the patient is discharged. 
</P>
<P>
 The TV viewers may notice that some doctors on "ER" never seem to go home. A 
parallel in real life is L.A. County's practice of forcing young physicians in 
training who are sleep deprived, overworked and frequently un- or 
under-supervised to make life and death decisions and perform highly technical 
medical and surgical procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Schedules for some specialties outside of emergency medicine include working 
unlimited hours per week with no overtime compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the current training system for physicians say that at its best, it 
is a cruel rite of passage, and at its worst, it perpetuates indentured 
servitude. 
</P>
<P>
 So despite any small technical flaws, "ER" portrays a lot more fact than 
fiction. And it illuminates a number of disturbing practices in county 
hospitals that must be rectified.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; A LESS-CLAMOROUS JESUS AND MARY CHAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK CRISAFULLI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scottish brothers Jim and William Reid of the Jesus and Mary Chain began their 
career a decade ago, burying delicate melodies under countless strata of 
distorted guitar. They're a few links further along their fraternal chain these 
days and are now content to let their languorous, lovelorn pop tunes jangle 
without any noisy embellishment. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday at the Hollywood Palladium, it was this less-clamorous Jesus and 
Mary Chain that put songs ahead of sonics and grooved its way through a 
tunefully solid set drawn mostly from its new album, "Stoned & Dethroned." 
</P>
<P>
 The touring quintet brought a harder, head-on, rock 'n' roll edge to new tunes 
such as "Save Me" and "Come On," but never approached the industrial-strength 
feedback of its concerts past. The group did occasionally reach back to pump up 
the shuffling techno-beats of older material and gave spirited performances of 
earlier hits such as "Sidewalking" and the incendiary "Reverence." 
</P>
<P>
 The stage lights, smoke machines and projected film images worked harder to 
hold the crowd's attention than the inert band did, but the tense mix of sugary 
melodies, Jim Reid's sourball vocals and William Reid's austere guitar parts 
made for some consistently gripping music.  
</P>
<P>
 Mazzy Star opened with a short set of dreamy, drifting laments that included 
the group's currently reborn hit "Fade Into You," from its 1993 album "So 
Tonight That I Might See." Eminently serene vocalist Hope Sandoval returned at 
evening's end to join the Jesus and Mary Chain in an encore rendition of its 
current hit "Sometimes Always." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Jesus and Mary Chain and Mazzy Star play tonight at Montezuma Hall, San 
Diego State University, 8 p.m. $20. (619) 594-6947 . CHUCK CRISAFULLI

TV REVIEW; STONES AEROBIC AS USUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like theater actors, the Rolling Stones really aren't playing to the front 
row, so TV isn't their ideal medium. It's more fun seeing the band and its 
massive funhouse-cum-jogging-track of a stage set from a bit of a distance in 
the stadiums they call home, than it is to have close-ups of Mick Jagger's 
expressionless exhortations and grandiloquent gestures. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, Friday's live, pay-per-view of a Stones concert in Dade County, 
Fla., pretty well delivered the figurative and literal workout that is the 
band's current trek. Early on, TV made all the athleticism look contrived, but 
by midway through the 2 1/2 hours there seemed to be a legitimate head of 
steam. 
</P>
<P>
 The set list was much the same as that of last month's Rose Bowl shows, with 
the addition of a three-song "unplugged" segment and three numbers involving 
guest stars.  
</P>
<P>
 The acoustic stretch, while seemingly a move toward the early-'90s requisite, 
was nonetheless a highlight, not simply because "Angie," "Dead Flowers" and 
"Sweet Virginia" recall a particularly productive time in the catalogue, but 
because the format locked Jagger into one undistracting place for a few 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting with Whoopi Goldberg's introduction, the guest shots were no big 
whoop: Sheryl Crow, a great match on paper, traded some prodigious but 
awkward-seeming vocal licks with Jagger on "Live With Me," while Bo Diddley and 
Robert Cray took brief, predictable turns at bat. CHRIS WILLMAN

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; INNOVATIVE TECHNO FROM ORBITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The paradox of techno these days is that the dance-oriented genre's most 
interesting and innovative music is not necessarily the most danceable. That 
was clear on Saturday the instant the English duo Orbital -- whose 
"Snivilisation" album is perhaps the year's most impressive techno creation -- 
took over from a series of beat-happy deejays at the Shrine Exhibition Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 With lasers flickering through the smoky, rococo aura of the room to give just 
enough of that "Max Headroom" ambience, Orbital's brother team of Philip and 
Paul Hartnoll crafted complex ebbs and flows of music -- real music, not just 
pulsating thumps and blips. 
</P>
<P>
 And much of the crowd, a multicultural mix of about 3,000 -- stayed with it, 
dancing when the music called for it, just standing and soaking in the colorful 
textures when the beat slowed or disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hartnolls, manipulating various computers and sound generators on a 
platform erected in the middle of the cavernous hall, still stuck largely to 
the standard rave methods, sculpting recorded compositions rather than actually 
performing music in the conventional sense. But they did it with enough craft 
and originality to escape the borders that often restrict less imaginative 
technoids. STEVE HOCHMAN

GALLARDO DEL REY: DAPPER GUITARIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jose Maria Gallardo del Rey is what you might call a guitarist's guitarist. 
</P>
<P>
 His playing -- as heard in the intimate Mission Theatre at the Multi-Cultural 
Music and Art Foundation in Northridge -- is meticulous: articulation, 
fingering, tone and coloring all deliberately addressed with an ear for 
clarity, evenness and fluency.An impeccable execution of a given passage -- 
everything in its place, carefully, studiously dispatched -- seems his utmost 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he is a dapper player, he is never a cold one. In his recital of mostly 
Spanish music Saturday night, the young guitarist from Seville showed himself 
both a sensitive and inward musician. His slow tempos -- actually, they sounded 
like the same one all evening -- were strangely pulseless, a sort of amorphous 
moving-forward-by-default, as he lavished details, coaxed phrases, urged lines 
and backed off for nuance. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, his basic sonority was quasi- sul ponticello -- that is, 
near the bridge -- a nasal sound and odd choice, generally. This, as well as 
his other traits, makes the listener (made one listener) aware of the guitar, 
and what the musician was doing with it, first, the music second. 
</P>
<P>
 His program avoided the hackneyed. It included a Sonata by one M. Castillo 
(there were no program notes), three pieces by Falla and in transcriptions by 
Gallardo del Rey, the Toccata in the Style of Corelli by S. de Murcia, some 
Spanish dances by Sanz and "Winter-Summer" from "Dos Estaciones Portenas" by 
Piazzolla. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of his own compositions concluded the event, the well- crafted, tonal, 
resourceful and Spanish-idiom "Noches de San Lorenzo" and "Rosales," and the 
sweet and buoyant "In Memoriam Django Reinhardt," which used a theme and styles 
of that gypsy/jazz guitarist. TIMOTHY MANGAN

TV REVIEWS; POWERFUL 'FREDERICK DOUGLASS' PORTRAIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a marriage made in television documentary heaven, filmmaker Orlando Bagwell 
meets historical figure Frederick Douglass in "Frederick Douglass: When the 
Lion Wrote History," the closest thing we are likely to see as the definitive 
audiovisual portrait of abolitionist Douglass' adventurous life. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagwell and his visually poetic films ("Roots of Resistance" among them) are a 
living argument for publicly funded television, and Douglass was his own best 
living case for the quashing of slavery and racism. 
</P>
<P>
 Blending typically elegant original images with a range of perspectives from 
various historians, Bagwell avoids overdoing both the talking head and 
artificial re-creation scenes. As we learn of Douglass' early years as an 
innocent child sent to a huge plantation, Bagwell creates poignant silhouetted 
images suggesting the loneliness of slavery and the separation of families. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the film's very beauty threatens to mitigate against slavery's 
barbarism; the filmmaker remains very dependent on Douglass' own vivid prose to 
press the issue (spoken by Charles S. Dutton with a power this actor usually 
reserves for the stage). 
</P>
<P>
 Short of reading Douglass' three autobiographies, the viewer will not get a 
more detailed telling of Douglass' life than this -- from his seeming release 
from the plantation, to his near-surrender under the whip of a "slave breaker," 
to his marriage late in life to a white suffragist. Like a writer struggling to 
find his own voice, Douglass fought to establish his unique perspective as an 
ex-slave bearing witness to what he considered to be American liberty's 
greatest challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagwell and his historians describe how Douglass had to battle as much against 
the presumptions and strategies of his white abolitionist allies as he did 
against slavery's advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many radical abolitionists, Douglass was shrewd -- knowing, for 
instance, that John Brown's plan to stage an armed slave revolt in 1859 was 
folly. Douglass was the ultimate burr in Abraham Lincoln's side, as he pressed 
and cajoled and lectured the president to turn the Civil War into a war about 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Bagwell doesn't suggest the slightest flaw or hint of ego in the man. 
It must have been there, but this is a history story with a hero, and it's 
Douglass as a lion that holds forth. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he died while agitating against the 1890s wave of lynching, the 
Douglass of this film lives through America's growing-up years, when the 
country's laws moved closer to his moral view of the world. 
</P>

TV REVIEWS; 'HEART' STAYS AFLOAT IN HEAVY SOAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let's see. Your husband -- an old, cold, miserly, bigoted tyrant -- suddenly 
dies, leaving control of his large estate in the hands of your miserly, greedy, 
bigoted son-in-law.What's a fragile, frumpy, downtrodden widow with a heavy 
Swedish accent to do? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, if that downtrodden widow is played by Ann-Margret, as she is in 
tonight's NBC movie "Following Her Heart," she hops on a tour bus to Nashville 
and, in six days, makes generous, amazingly supportive friends, has a glamorous 
make-over, discovers pink gin fizzes, enters a talent show, finds Mr. Right, 
meets her amazingly generous and supportive pen pal whose husband happens to be 
an attorney (the will, remember?) -- and celebrates racial harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 And, oh, yes. She gets real spunky. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Ann-Margret as the widow Ingalill -- looking terrific, even in her 
absurd frump guise -- among the stellar perpetrators of this often 
unintentionally funny soaper are George Segal, who veers suspiciously close to 
parody, Brenda Vaccaro, who has a few fun moments as the good-time gal friend 
with a heart of gold, and, remarkably, Oscar- and Emmy-winning director Lee 
Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor should writer Merry Helm be forgotten in the excruciatingly cloying 
proceedings, which include such wince-making lines as country singer Travis 
Tritt's talent show homage to Ingalill and pal Maise (the golden-voiced Sandra 
Reaves) after one of the most contrived scenes of sisterhood in TV history: 
"Don't ever give up your dreams, OK? 'Cause I think you girls have got what it 
takes." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Following Her Heart" airs at 9 tonight on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39).

 Pushing out his words laboriously, Chris Fonseca, who has cerebral palsy, sits 
on a stage in front of a microphone cheerfully recalling his boyhood and the 
time his sister taught him to ties his shoes. Together . 
</P>
<P>
 Such amiable self-mockery -- not to be confused with self-loathing -- is 
typical of "Look Who's Laughing," a PBS documentary produced by Randy Johnson 
and starring six comics with disabilities. They range from veterans Alex Valdez 
(blind) and Geri Jewell (cerebral palsy) to Fonseca, Kathy Buckley (hearing 
impaired), J.D. Englund (paraplegic) and Brett Leake (muscular dystrophy), who 
seems to stand almost at a backward tilt while performing in front of an 
audience: "Someone wants to know what happened to me, I tell 'em. I broke a 
chain letter." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the program extends the menu of mainstream comedy material to include 
even "gimp"-style jokes, some of these comics are clearly unwilling to rely 
solely on their disabilities for laughs -- with Valdez, for example, doing 
jokes on his Chicano background in addition to his blindness. Nevertheless, 
Fonseca comes across as funniest (on this segmented show, at least) precisely 
because the images of cerebral palsy-caused clumsiness that he evokes are 
themselves so funny. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, little of the comedy here is inventive, and for the most part 
"Look Who's Laughing" could be described as comedically challenged, its 
disjointed format of sound bites and selected punch lines failing to capture 
either the flow of a comics' stand-up work or the club environment in which 
these performers so often work. 
</P>

 * "Look Who's Laughing" airs tonight at 10:30 on KCET-TV Channel 28 and at 9 
p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24. HOWARD ROSENBERG

BONDHOLDERS TENDER 63% OF HOLDINGS IN GREYHOUND; RESTRUCTURING: THE BUS 
COMPANY'S FINANCIAL ADVISER EXPRESSES OPTIMISM THAT BANKRUPTCY WILL BE AVOIDED.

<P>
 Greyhound Lines Inc. said Sunday that more than 63% of its largest bondholder 
class has agreed to tender its holdings to the company in a financial 
restructuring designed to keep it out of Bankruptcy Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The tender offer to Greyhound's subordinated debt holders, if successful, 
would complete the bus company's restructuring, said Wilbur Ross Jr., senior 
managing partner for Rothschild Inc., Greyhound's financial adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is more than just a step," Ross said, "it's the step. There are bad 
implications if we don't have this done before Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 The offer to bondholders requires the tendering of at least 90% of Greyhound's 
convertible, subordinated debt and the completion of a $35-million stock 
offering to current shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Greyhound said in a statement that should the offer be unsuccessful, its board 
has approved the preparation of documents necessary for filing a prepackaged 
bankruptcy plan. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 10, Greyhound and a bondholders' committee agreed to the 
reorganization, which would give bondholders about 45% of Greyhound in exchange 
for forgiving $98.9 million in debt and $4.5 million in interest. The 
bondholders would also get to nominate two of Greyhound's nine directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Greyhound said the tender offer would give subordinated bondholders about 256 
shares of common stock in the Dallas-based company for each $1,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
 The offer was mailed to bondholders on Nov. 23 and set to expire on Dec. 21. 
Ross expressed confidence that the offer will be successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Greyhound has had its share of its ruts in the road," he said. "Nobody has 
announced opposition. There is no logical source of trouble going forward. As 
the holders get to understand it, they will understand the benefits to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Holders of other bonds will not be affected by the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the values assigned to the rights offering, Greyhound's stock is 
expected to be worth about $2.15 a share after the restructuring, according to 
Robin Phelan, the attorney representing the bondholders committee.

SOUTH KOREA EAGER TO OPEN BUSINESS WITH THE NORTH; ASIA: ENTHUSIASM SWEEPS 
THROUGH COMMUNITY AFTER A WASHINGTON-PYONGYANG AGREEMENT EASED TENSIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 There may well be no stranger place on earth to try to do business than North 
Korea, ruled by the world's last surviving Stalinist regime. 
</P>
<P>
 While other Communist governments have collapsed or embraced a significant 
degree of market economics, the hard-line rulers in Pyongyang still exert rigid 
control over social and economic life. Few foreigners are allowed in, and they 
are closely monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, enthusiasm for doing business with the north is sweeping through 
South Korea's business community in the wake of a Washington-Pyongyang 
agreement last month that eased tensions over the north's apparent efforts to 
build nuclear bombs. Under the agreement, North Korea is to give up its ability 
to produce plutonium in return for economic aid and diplomatic links with 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Even members of the American Chamber of Commerce in Seoul have begun thinking 
seriously about opportunities in the north, despite U.S. laws that currently 
bar Americans from business dealings there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a wave of enthusiasm running through our chamber," said James H. 
Riddle, chamber president. "That . . . is local management. When you get back 
to headquarters in Chicago (they may say): 'Huh, what? North Korea? Are you 
kidding me? Get this kid outta here. He's mad. Better transfer him out of 
Seoul. He's been there too long.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The obstacles to significant levels of South Korean investment in the north 
remain huge, and barriers are even greater for U.S. business. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is also a powerful economic logic to expanded ties between the 
prosperous south, with its 44 million people, and the much poorer north, with a 
population of 22 million. 
</P>
<P>
 And uniting South Korea -- already the world's 12th-largest economy with a 
1993 gross domestic product of $329 billion -- with the north could create a 
new East Asian powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooperation would benefit both sides, said Park Soon Seo, general manager for 
planning at Ssangyong Corp. "We have capital and some technology to provide to 
them, and they still have enough available land for factories, and manpower. 
Once we unite . . . we will have a powerful synergy effect." 
</P>
<P>
 During a brief period of Korean detente in 1991 and 1992, the two sides 
pledged to open direct trade and investment, and some South Koreans visited the 
north. But Seoul banned such visits last year when tensions erupted over 
Pyongyang's nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korean President Kim Young Sam lifted the ban after last month's 
Washington-Pyongyang accord, saying it was time for the two Koreas to cooperate 
"to establish an economic community." 
</P>
<P>
 Pyongyang's first response was a nasty propaganda snarl. "The proposal of the 
traitor was . . . a camouflage for concealing the dark designs of the puppets 
for national division and total confrontation," the north's official Korean 
Central News Agency declared. 
</P>
<P>
 But southerners dismissed this as typical Pyongyang rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Samsung Corp. official, who spoke on condition he not be identified by name, 
said the company has kept in touch with Pyongyang developments through a 
"messenger" of Korean ethnicity but foreign citizenship, who visits the north 
every month. Samsung recently received an invitation to send a high-level 
company delegation to the north before the end of this year, and plans to do 
so, the Samsung official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Few in Seoul believe that the north can maintain the rigidity of its system 
for more than a few more years. Battered by a cut-off in Russian aid, the 
north's economy -- 15 times smaller than the south's economy -- has been 
shrinking for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Many here think that the government of Kim Jong Il, son and designated 
successor to the late President Kim Il Sung, can avoid collapse only by 
embracing Chinese-style economic reforms that would open up the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The north will be a favorite hunting ground for South Korean chaebols (huge 
business conglomerates), and American companies will be playing follower," 
Riddle predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.S. official who visited Seoul this month with Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher said that an eventual easing of restrictions on U.S. 
economic ties with North Korea "is part of the general goal" of the recent 
Washington-Pyongyang agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there's no set game plan," added the official. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korean firms already conduct indirect trade with the north, worth $232 
million in the first eight months of this year, up from $25 million in 1990. 
Financial arrangements are handled through intermediaries in third countries. 
Ships must fly third-country flags, but after sailing from South Korean ports 
into international waters, they head directly to North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We supply some raw materials to North Korea, and we let them make things, and 
we buy it back again and sell to other countries," he explained. "We found that 
the quality made by North Korea was acceptable. The labor cost is cheaper than 
in South Korea, and we are using the same language, and geographically we have 
no problem at all for transportation." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Ssangyong's partners remain mysterious to the southern firm. "We call it 
'blind business,' " Park said. "We don't know who makes our products for us. . 
. . If one day the middleman disappears, then the business disappears." 
</P>
<P>
 While South Koreans are interested in the relatively developed Pyongyang area 
-- only 120 miles northwest of Seoul -- North Korea's main interest is in 
attracting investment to a special economic zone now under construction near 
its northeastern border with China and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 This area includes the small cities of Najin and Sonbong but lacks the 
electric power, telecommunications, transport and other infrastructure needed 
for modern business activities. It has only two main attractions: its 
remoteness from North Korea's population centers and its proximity to China and 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of attracting foreign investment to a lonely corner of the world's 
most isolated nation may seem absurd. Yet business people and analysts in South 
Korea take the Najin-Sonbong zone quite seriously because they believe that 
North Korea is desperate for development and while imposing restrictions, will 
make the areas attractive to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea "will set up these special economic zones one by one," Yoo Jung 
Ho, a Korea Development Institute scholar, predicted. "They'll try to get 
foreign currency and some economic development. But they'll try to maintain the 
politics and the society and all the rest as usual in the rest of the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Under this scenario, Yoo acknowledged, South Korean and other foreign 
investment may help prolong the dictatorship by throwing it an economic 
lifeline. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, fear of the disruption in the south should the North Korean 
government suddenly collapse is a factor encouraging big corporations to 
consider investing in the north. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ssangyong hopes to expand from its current trade in shoes and jackets to 
joint-venture manufacturing and fishing, Park said. 
</P>
<P>
 But major progress will take time, Park said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm living maybe 50 kilometers (31 miles) from North Korea," he said. 
"Geographically, it's very close, but it's very far away in reality. As 
businessmen, we still think it's not a logical place to invest a big amount of 
money, but as a big company, we can take a risk with a small amount of money. 
The South Korean government is ready. Now the ball is in the North Korean 
court. We have to wait to see how they respond."

 Agriculture Hearing Scheduled: The U.S. Dept. of Agriculture will hold a 
public hearing in San Diego on Tuesday regarding a matter important to 
California avocado growers. The public hearing will be on a Mexican request 
that the U.S. regulators lift its ban on imports of Mexican avocados in all 
states except Alaska.Mexico has asked for permission to begin selling fruit in 
19 Eastern, Northern and Midwestern states, a move that could hurt California 
growers who control 90% of the U.S. market. The United States has banned 
imports of the Mexican fruit since 1914 because of fears that seed weevils, 
seed moths and other pests that plague Mexico's crop would threaten production 
in California and Florida. The hearing could be contentious. U.S. agricultural 
interests secured provisions in the North American Free Trade Agreement that 
maintained the quarantine on Mexican avocados, frustrating efforts by Mexican 
growers to open up the U.S. market. Mexican growers are expected to present 
scientific studies showing progress in eradicating the pests -- evidence that 
groups representing California's 6,000 growers will dispute, sources said. The 
hearing begins at 9 a.m. at the Holiday Inn at the Embarcadero, 1355 N. Harbor 
Drive.

 Unemployment Figures Due: When the November jobless rate reports come out 
Friday for Los Angeles County and the rest of the state, it should give 
analysts a clearer sense of just how solid the apparent economic recovery here 
really is. Reports have shown unemployment in the state declining sharply over 
the last three months and over the last two months in the county, even as 
separate surveys show California continuing to lose jobs.Many economists are 
skeptical that things are improving as much as the jobless figures suggest. 
Another month's figures, however, could help establish a true trend. In 
October, the jobless rate was 7.8% for the county, down from 8.3% in September 
and 10.3% in August. For the state, unemployment in October was 7.7%, 
continuing its decline from 9.0% in July. In the November figures, "If we don't 
get a little upward bounce (in the jobless rates), it means we really have 
something cooking," one economist said.

 Ford in Talks With Mazda: Ford Motor Co. said that talks with Mazda Motor 
Corp. are in "an advanced stage" for the production by Ford of a car for Mazda 
based on an existing Ford model. A U.S.-based Ford spokesman said he agreed 
with the general outlines of a report appearing in London's Sunday Times, but 
he emphasized that no agreement had been reached.The newspaper quoted industry 
sources as saying plants in Britain, Germany and Spain were candidates to build 
the Ford Fiesta-based, Mazda-badged car. The Sunday Times story quoted Henry 
Wallace, an executive of both Ford and Mazda, as saying that such a deal should 
be announced "within the next two to three weeks." Ford owns a stake of about 
25% in Mazda.

 A Near-Smokeless Cigarette?: R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. has developed a 
near-smokeless cigarette that the company hopes tastes better than a similar 
product launched six years ago that flopped.The Eclipse produces little 
secondary smoke because it does not burn tobacco, although it does have as much 
nicotine as most cigarettes. Analysts said Eclipse could be a breakthrough 
product for RJR because it reduces secondary smoke and may help reduce 
incidence of cancer among smokers. However, RJR is keeping tight-lipped about 
the success of its marketing tests.

 Employers Report Big Hiring Plans: According to the quarterly survey of 15,000 
businesses nationwide by the temporary employment agency Manpower Inc., 22% of 
those responding said they plan to add to their work forces in the first 
quarter of next year.That is fastest pace for a first quarter in six years. 
Twelve percent said they expect a drop, another 63% that they will remain at 
present levels, and 3% that they are unsure, the survey said. A year ago, 18% 
anticipated additional staffing and 13% planned decreases. Manufacturers have 
the most aggressive hiring plans; geographically, prospects continue to be 
strongest in the South and the Midwest.

 While others his age were cruising the strip this summer, 18-year-old Brian 
Wilson was working on a way to make that drive more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 As a participant in Inroads' Los Angeles office, a nonprofit organization that 
places high-achieving minority students in internships with business and 
industry, the UCLA freshman worked as a lab technician at an Arco refinery in 
Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a good feeling from doing the job and knowing that the only way they 
could sell that product was through me," said Wilson, a chemical engineering 
major who tested gasoline for impurities. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other Southern California minority youths will have similar 
opportunities next summer. The Los Angeles office of Inroads is taking 
applications until Dec. 2 for 1995 summer internships. 
</P>
<P>
 Inroads was founded in Chicago in 1970 by Frank Carr, an entrepreneur who said 
he was moved by the civil rights campaign of Martin Luther King Jr. and wanted 
to help improve the economic prospects of young minorities. It has grown into 
one of the largest career development organizations in the nation, with 
branches in 43 cities. The Los Angeles office, opened nine years ago, currently 
places interns in 65 corporations in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is increasingly popular with corporations trying to adapt to a 
21st Century work force that will be strikingly more diverse than past ones. 
These companies, said Inroads managers, want to identify and groom promising 
job candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The employee mix is shifting and becoming mostly minority," said Sheri Betts, 
managing director of the Los Angeles branch and a former Inroads intern. 
</P>
<P>
 Adapting to the changing worker pool is especially important to California 
industry, she said, where demographic trends point to a work force in which 
minorities will be the majority by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to be a lot of competition for the talent," Betts said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to helping industry prepare for the future, Inroads interns said 
the program has helped them chart their own career plans. The internships were 
invaluable in providing the technical and social skills necessary in the 
corporate world, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you how much this program matured me," said Jose A. Campos, a 
former intern who is now a senior accountant with Deloitte & Touche in Los 
Angeles. "By the time you graduate from college, you are already well versed in 
business skills and know all the buzz words." 
</P>
<P>
 Recruits must be gifted young African Americans, Latinos or Native Americans, 
and must pass rigorous screening. The program is not open to Asian Americans, 
who are considered well represented in the corporate world. Students may apply 
as early as the senior year in high school, but no later than the college 
sophomore year. They typically work full-time each summer until college 
graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of corporations that have hired Inroads interns gave them high 
marks. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are definitely professional, definitely polished," said Derek Taylor, a 
personnel representative with the Federal Reserve Bank in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Betts said that Inroads' training is integral to the program's success. 
Interns are coached on issues ranging from proper dress to how they 
communicate. 
</P>
<P>
 Betts, a graduate of Washington University in St. Louis who spent summers from 
1976 to 1980 working for Blue Cross of Missouri in St. Louis, said she learned 
first hand the value of pre-placement services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back then we didn't have all the classes," she said. "The business world was 
totally foreign to me, even little things like what to wear." 
</P>
<P>
 Students may move to different tasks within a company, depending on their 
skill level and experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to give them client experience after their sophomore year," said Janet 
Leong, recruiting manager with Arthur Andersen and Co.  
</P>
<P>
 Competition to get into Inroads is intense. The Los Angeles office will choose 
about 75 students for 1995 positions with businesses in Los Angeles and Orange 
counties, and expects to get 1,000 applications. About a third of those 
qualified will be placed, managers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications are available from high school guidance counselors and college 
placement and intern offices. 
</P>
<P>
 An intern must maintain a 3.0 grade point average and complete 24 hours of 
community service during each academic school year -- standards some students 
said they find easier than working a full-time job during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is sometimes so demanding that it makes the school year feel like more of 
a vacation," said Angelica Villichana, a senior at UCLA who worked in sales and 
marketing at the Los Angeles office of Colgate-Palmolive Corp.  
</P>
<P>
 Villichana, who will graduate in December, has interviewed for a full-time 
position with Colgate-Palmolive. Employment after graduation is not guaranteed 
but many companies who have already invested substantially in Inroads interns 
have strong incentives to make them permanent hires. The organization requires 
a company to pay $4,000 for each student, in addition to the student's salary.

 Machine Tool Orders Plunge: October orders for U.S. tools totaled $365.3 
million, down 29% from $514.6 million in September but 45.5% higher than in 
October, 1993, according to the Assn. for Manufacturing Technology. The trade 
group represents makers of tools that cut and shape metal for products ranging 
from appliances to airplanes.For the first 10 months of the year, machine tool 
orders totaled $3.71 billion, a 35.8% increase from the same period a year ago. 
Higher orders for machine tools tend to indicate that manufacturers are 
optimistic about sales. Analysts did not expect October's figures to compete 
with those of September, when the industry's most well-received trade show in 
at least a decade prompted a 57.2% increase in orders over August.

 When a group of war veterans set up Taiwan's China Airlines 37 years ago, all 
they had was $10,000 and contacts with former air force comrades in the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't even have a license to fly down the coast to Hualien," said Lodge 
Lo, the airline's spokesman. "They thought they were running a taxi company." 
</P>
<P>
 The airline was to become one of the most profitable in the world. But now, at 
the end of a disastrous year, shareholders may wish they had invested in 
something less risky. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a very, very bad year," Lo said, shaking his head. "We don't think 
we will go into the red, but profits will be very, very small." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, CAL made $119 million after taxes on revenue of $1.67 billion. Its 
1994 profit may fall to $15.3 million on revenue of about $1.53 billion, Lo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bad luck started in November, 1993, when a CAL Boeing 747 crashed in Hong 
Kong Harbor during a landing attempt. Miraculously, no one was killed. Then 
last April, a CAL Airbus exploded on landing at Nagoya, Japan, and 264 of the 
271 people on board died. The airline set aside $156,000 for each family in 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 A different kind of disaster struck in March, when 24 Taiwanese tourists were 
killed in an arson and robbery in China. The crime prompted Taiwanese tour 
groups to boycott China, and traffic levels on the airline's highly lucrative 
Hong Kong route took a steep dive. 
</P>
<P>
 CAL says the problems are likely to continue next year because of overcapacity 
in the region and tougher competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we can say is that we are confident we won't be in the red," Lo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts warn that the worst may be yet to come when, in 1997, the British 
colony becomes part of China again. The Taiwanese government bans direct 
transport links and official relations with mainland China, so CAL could be 
hard-pressed to continue the Hong Kong route, analysts say. CAL flies that 
route 204 times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hong Kong-to-Taipei route accounts for 15% of their revenue, but 25% to 
30% of earnings," said Christine Lee, who follows the airline for Barings 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Flights to and from Japan accounted for 20% of revenue, the airline reported 
last year. Flights to Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok and other Southeast Asia 
cities accounted for 42%. 
</P>
<P>
 Taipei has said it will consider Hong Kong a special region of China after 
1997, and will attach special conditions to dealing with Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Taiwan's legislators will need some fancy footwork to maintain 
the myth of no direct transport links with China while allowing CAL and other 
carriers to fly into Hong Kong after 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 They will also have to get around the current ban on official talks if they 
are to negotiate with China on landing rights for Hong Kong after 1997, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lo said Hong Kong plans to extend the current landing rights, due to expire in 
1995, until 1997 only. The crucial post-1997 rights for Taipei will have to be 
hammered out with Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these rules have to be untangled and we have to find a way through," Lo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Paradoxically, behind the bleak prospects in Hong Kong lies a tantalizing 
scenario: Taiwan may open up direct links with Chinese cities on the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 Some tentative steps in this direction have already been taken, with Taipei 
commissioning non-government reports on the subject. CAL has sent teams to 
survey facilities at airfields in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chengdu, Lo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Up-and-coming rival EVA Airways, a subsidiary of the huge Evergreen shipping 
group, is also positioning itself for a shot at what promise to be highly 
profitable direct mainland routes, analysts said.

 Beef Exports Go Begging: Australian Primary Industries Minister Bob Collins 
said a recent scare about contaminated Australian beef in key foreign markets 
had, as of last week, cost the industry millions of dollars. Australia is the 
world's largest beef exporter, with beef ranking third among the nation's 
exports.The United States, Japan and South Korea banned imports of Australian 
beef after the Australian government said that residues of chlorfluazuron had 
been found in some meat. The pesticide is used to kill caterpillars in cotton. 
Because of widespread drought in Australia, cotton byproduct from ginning has 
been used as cattle feed. Collins said the practice, which affected about 1% of 
Australian cattle herds, has been stopped. No contaminated beef is believed to 
have been shipped overseas, he said.

ISLAMIC MILITANTS TARGET ARAB INTELLECTUALS, ARTISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rifaat Said used to be one of Cairo's best-loved men-about-town, a man who 
relished nothing better than a good argument. As head of Egypt's leftist Tegamu 
Party, he could always be counted on to step out prominently on behalf of 
Egypt's abundant ranks of the disinherited and to ridicule, with his sharp pen, 
the excesses of Muslim fundamentalism. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Said started getting anonymous messages in the mail, like the one he 
received only a few weeks ago: 
</P>
<P>
 "You dog," it said. "I'll kill you, you atheist. But I will not shoot you. 
I'll cut you with my knife, and I'll throw your flesh to the dogs to eat, so 
you won't contaminate holy ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Said's life changed dramatically after such vengeful missives from Islamic 
militants started pouring in. Now he travels nowhere without his six 
machine-gun-armed bodyguards. His daughter ducked out of his car at a traffic 
light the last time she rode with him to school, overwhelmed by the gun barrels 
bristling out the back window that every once in a while the guards would 
click, tic-tic-tic , into firing mode. 
</P>
<P>
 Now when Said shyly lifts up his jacket, there's a gun in a holster underneath 
it. He doesn't go to parties anymore. He has nearly eliminated his lecture 
schedule at the American University of Cairo. He doesn't do weddings. 
</P>
<P>
 Like an uneasily growing number of intellectuals and artists threatened by 
Islamic extremists around the Arab world, Said is on the run, but he's not 
hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they assassinated Farag Foda (a prominent Egyptian secularist gunned 
down after engaging in heated public debates with fundamentalist leaders), many 
people stopped writing. I was the only one who continued attacking them," Said 
said with a little grin that seems startling under the circumstances. "Of 
course, I feel sympathy for my wife and my children. But what shall I do?" 
</P>
<P>
 While militant threats against writers, singers, actors and intellectuals have 
been a way of life in the Islamic world since the late Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini's death decree against British author Salman Rushdie, the last few 
months have seen a dramatic increase, reflecting the growing schism between 
Arabs committed to Islamizing society and those equally bent on maintaining 
free and open public discourse. 
</P>
<P>
 The knife attack last month on the Nobel Prize-winning novelist Naguib Mahfouz 
pointed up many of the debates that increasingly are polarizing Muslims at a 
time of traumatic political change in the Middle East: Mahfouz was attacked as 
an apologist for Zionism, as a protege of America and the West, as a symbol of 
Egypt's controversial cooperation in the peace process with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The target of the assailants was not the person of Mahfouz but rather the 
image of Egypt in the international community," commented Cairo's leading daily 
newspaper, Al Ahram. "His international standing and persona are symbolic of 
the secular orientation of the Egyptian and Arab intelligentsia." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side, Cairo cleric Sheik Mohammed Ghazali, while deploring the 
violence against Mahfouz, lashed out at the decision to publish for the first 
time this month -- against Mahfouz's own request -- the author's "Children of 
Gebelawi," a 1959 allegorical novel about the prophets banned by Islamic decree 
for two decades in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 The book was published in full in a special edition of the Tegamu Party's Al 
Ahali newspaper that sold like wildfire shortly after the attack on the 
83-year-old writer. Al Ahram, the voice of the Egyptian government, waived the 
copyright that it has held dormant for 20 years and announced its own plans to 
serialize the book. 
</P>
<P>
 "We question ourselves about people who hate God dearly, detest Islam 
completely and quarrel with inspiration everywhere," Ghazali lamented of the 
publishers. "I know of those who never had the privilege of kneeling before 
God, who on the contrary are happy when they hear about a new bar opening, feel 
sad if a new mosque is built and feel the Earth is getting narrow around them. 
The state destroys itself by leaving them to bark against Islam's caravan." 
</P>
<P>
 Security analysts fear that the attack on Mahfouz, in which a man holding a 
bouquet of flowers approached the writer on the sidewalk as if to shake his 
hand and then stabbed him in the neck, reflects the new kind of savagery 
witnessed in militant fundamentalist attacks in Algeria against intellectuals, 
some of whom have had their throats slashed in front of their families. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two dozen journalists have been assassinated in Algeria, which is 
locked in an increasingly violent clash between Islamic fundamentalists and the 
old regime. In recent months, attacks like these have escalated. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Algerian Berber singer Lounes Matoub -- who has declared himself as "neither 
an Arab nor a Muslim," openly professed his love of whiskey and dedicated a 
recent record to a fellow Berber activist assassinated by Islamic militants -- 
was kidnaped by militants Sept. 25 and held for two weeks. When he was released 
unharmed, he had a message from the Armed Islamic Group, Algeria's most violent 
Islamic faction: "The villagers must understand that we are not against them 
but that we are fighting an illegitimate regime," it declared. "We are asking 
them to help us and not to greet us with hunting rifles when we appear in their 
villages." 
</P>
<P>
 * Four days after Matoub's kidnaping, Algerian pop singer Cheb Hasni was shot 
and killed in the western city of Oran after religious leaders reportedly 
issued a fatwa, or religious ruling, ordering the death of any singers 
considered vulgar. 
</P>
<P>
 * A knife-wielding man believed to be an Islamic militant stabbed popular 
Sudanese singer Khogali Osman to death and wounded two other artists at a union 
club in Khartoum on Nov. 11, an unexpected attack in a country that already has 
an Islamic fundamentalist government. The Sudanese government condemned the 
killing and affirmed the state's respect for the status of artists. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin is under the protection of 1,200 police 
officers assigned for her visit to France following her flight from Muslim 
fundamentalist death threats at home earlier this year. Nasrin has been ordered 
to stand trial Dec. 10 for blaspheming Islam and has said she will eventually 
agree to serve a prison sentence if convicted on condition that the government 
can guarantee her safety in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim of such attacks by militants does not seem to be to target the 
individuals' lifestyles, political analysts say, but rather to curb the ability 
of these intellectuals to move the body politic in a more secular direction, 
either through their music, books, newspaper columns or films. 
</P>
<P>
 A common complaint of Muslim organizations is that access to the mass media in 
most Arab countries is limited to the government and government-approved 
organizations, most of which are essentially secular. (Secularists in Egypt, 
however, complain that the government airwaves have grown too religious in an 
attempt to meet the demands of the militants.) 
</P>
<P>
 "These people (intellectuals) do have an important secularizing influence, 
though in a very diffused manner," said Saad Eddin Ibrahim, a prominent 
Egyptian writer and professor who has written extensively on the Islamic 
movements. 
</P>
<P>
 "That has become very clear, I think, in the last seven or eight months, when 
the artistic community rose up through its own creative work against the 
fanatic extremist Islamists," Ibrahim said. The writer cited a recent film by 
one of Egypt's most popular actors -- on a terrorist black list -- ridiculing 
Islamic militants and special anti-fundamentalist television programming during 
the holy month of Ramadan earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "These programs have tremendous impact on public opinion. It actually isolated 
the extremists, and if there was a lull or downward turn in violence, it was 
mostly due to these kinds of programs, not the government's security measures," 
Ibrahim said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ibrahim himself has become a target of the extremists, most notably when he 
tried to organize a conference on Egyptian minorities in Cairo a few months 
ago. The Muslim Brotherhood-dominated biweekly newspaper Al Shaab issued a call 
to "use any means" to block the conference, which was to raise the 
controversial issue of relations between Egypt's Muslims and Christian Copts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The words 'any means' always translate to violence. That was a public 
invitation to any Islamist to take the law into his own hands," said Ibrahim, 
who at the government's request moved the conference to a neighboring country, 
Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
 No Islamic groups have claimed responsibility for the Mahfouz attack, and 
indeed, some have condemned it, although government officials say some of the 
perpetrators arrested or killed are linked to the outlawed Gamaa al Islamiya, 
or Islamic Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Islamists have praised Mahfouz for refusing even from his hospital bed to 
sanction the publishing of "Children of Gebelawi." But Egypt's notorious Sheik 
Omar Abdel Rahman, the spiritual leader of the Gamaa al Islamiya who is 
awaiting trial in New York in the World Trade Center bombing case, said in 1989 
that Mahfouz and Rushdie were alike: "Apostates, as are all of those who speak 
of Islam as evil. The judgment upon them is repentance, and for he who does not 
repent, death." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahfouz apparently still takes the threat seriously. His associates say the 
author considers republication of the book an invitation to "a second 
assassination attempt." 
</P>
<P>
 Mainstream Islamic figures seem willing to give Mahfouz the benefit of the 
doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Naguib Mahfouz made a mistake 35 years ago with the novel, but he also had 
very respectable accomplishments since then," said Mohammed Abdel Quddous, a 
well-known Islamic writer in Cairo and son of the famed late novelist Hussein 
Abdel Quddous. 
</P>
<P>
 Quddous said the roots of the violence against intellectuals can be traced to 
the violence that Arab regimes have directed at the Islamic trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should not ask people who are not getting their freedom to respect other 
people's freedom. The intellectuals in Algeria, for example, have an anti-Islam 
position, and they have welcomed the (January, 1992,) cancellation of the 
elections" in which fundamentalists would have scored a victory, Quddous said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The murder of Farag Foda was by a group that has always been chased by the 
government. They were not allowed freedom of expression, so it was not such a 
strange thing that they would react like that," he said. "If there were freedom 
of speech, there would not be the need for guns. . . . But how do you expect 
stability to reign when there is no freedom?" 
</P>
<P>
 In a cluttered apartment in the posh Cairo district of Zamalek, Said Ashmawi, 
a former chief security court judge and outspoken writer against Islamic 
fundamentalism, sits with his drapes drawn during the day and with an armed 
guard sipping tea on a chair outside his door. Another guard, connected by 
walkie-talkie, sits in the apartment lobby downstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashmawi's name is enough to draw a snort from even the most moderate Islamist. 
How could they have hit Mahfouz and not touch Ashmawi, steamed one Islamic 
intellectual, who asked not to be identified by name. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashmawi responds with writings on his computer, producing new treatises in 
which he turns fundamentalism on its head, usually by probing ideological and 
theological holes in the arguments of the fundamentalists. In a recent series 
of articles, he analyzed the traditional Koranic justification for Muslim women 
covering their heads with a veil and argued that it was unfounded. A Saudi 
magazine, Al Tawhid, responded angrily, calling him anti-Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, Egypt's highest religious authority branded Ashmawi an apostate, 
which he has regarded as the equivalent of a death sentence. Although Ashmawi 
continues to publish, the strain is evident. He is nearly always angry and 
becomes vituperative when the issue of human rights for the Islamic followers 
is raised. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have they human rights and I haven't?" he fumed. "After 14 years, these 
people (at Al Tawhid) are repeating all this again and saying there's a fatwa 
against me. This article is justification for any militant to execute me! 
Should these people have the right to attack decent and liberal people like me, 
when they are unable to answer what I write?" 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Ashmawi evidently relishes the role of attacker and says he has no 
plans to stop writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm living in this dangerous situation since 1980, and I believe I have a 
mission, and anyone who is looking to fulfill his mission or to enlighten Islam 
and Muslims' ideas will be subject to something like that," he said. "I believe 
I have to go on. And if I am murdered, my death could be a part of my mission." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahfouz himself has spoken only sparingly from his hospital bed, calling on 
the world not to confuse Islam with terrorism. But in his regular column for Al 
Ahram last month, he hinted that there is more than enough blame to go around. 
</P>
<P>
 "People seem to have grown intolerant of discussion and unforgiving of 
difference. Each person who presents a view feels that he is an authority on 
the matter and that his view is the only one and should be unanimously accepted 
by all. Those who object should not go unpunished," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 He concluded: "Long years of totalitarian rule have left their scar. We need a 
process of salvation that touches our very spirits."

FLESH-EATING BACTERIA KILLS VENTURA EDUCATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 What appears to be California's first death from the so-called flesh-eating 
bacteria was recorded Sunday here, where the popular chancellor of the Ventura 
County Community College District died a few days after complaining of a severe 
sore throat. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas G. Lakin, 50, died Sunday afternoon at Los Robles Regional Medical 
Center. Ventura County Senior Deputy Coroner Mitch Breese confirmed that the 
cause of death was necrotizing fasciitis, which has been dubbed flesh-eating 
bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 The ailment is caused by a virulent, sometimes deadly strain of streptococcus 
and other germs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although friends said Sunday that Lakin had complained of a severe sore throat 
as early as last Wednesday, he did not seek medical treatment until Friday, 
they said, when he went to the Los Robles emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 He was treated at the hospital for symptoms of strep throat, but was released 
hours later, said Jeff Marsee, vice chancellor of the college district. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin was admitted to the medical center when he returned to the emergency 
room Saturday after a sharp pain began in his leg and his throat failed to 
improve, Marsee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were focusing on the pain in the leg area," said Marsee, who spent most 
of Saturday night and Sunday at the hospital with Lakin and his family, while 
doctors tried to stop the bacteria from spreading. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this is a very rare bacteria," Marsee said. "When it goes, it goes like 
wildfire." 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin, the highest-ranking African American official in Ventura County, whose 
population is about 2% black, was president of Los Angeles Southwest Community 
College for five years before taking his Ventura County post in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin's is the fifth case of flesh-eating bacteria reported in Ventura County 
in the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians who treated the chancellor over the weekend declined to discuss 
details of the case, citing a family request for privacy. Hospital officials 
also declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Breese said the diagnosis was made after exhaustive tests at the hospital 
to see whether the chancellor had any other health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did CAT scans, all the tests and it all came up negative," Breese said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite recent news media attention, the problem is not new or even more 
widely reported than in the past, medical experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Its name -- necrotizing fasciitis -- comes from the words necrosis, meaning 
death of tissue, and fascia , the tissue that binds skin to muscle. The ailment 
is caused by a dangerous strain of the common germ known as Group A 
streptococcus. In 1990, the most recent year such fatalities were officially 
counted, Group A strep accounted for 2,000 to 3,000 deaths in the nation, up to 
half of those from the necrotizing fasciitis strain. 
</P>
<P>
 The condition develops when the body succumbs to a series of bacterial 
infections and can flare up with either a cut in the skin or a lapse in the 
immune system. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no other fatal cases are known in California, a 51-year-old Denver 
woman died in July after her legs below the knees, an arm and a breast were 
amputated because of the bacteria. A 72-year-old San Antonio man and a 
33-year-old Michigan man also died in June from the disorder. The disease has 
claimed at least 11 lives in Britain and cases have recently been reported in 
New York, Florida, and Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
 All five of the Ventura County cases were treated at Los Robles Regional 
Medical Center. The hospital says it treats about eight cases of the bacteria 
every year, including patients from Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Bernard Donner, a 35-year-old Santa Barbara triathlete, 
lost most of the flesh on his leg to the bacteria. He was treated at a Sherman 
Oaks Hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin's death shocked Ventura County college officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm floored by this. . . . I'm just shell-shocked," said Gary Morgan, an 
instructor at Oxnard College who knew Lakin. "It sounds more like a horror 
movie than real life." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who worked closest to Lakin said Sunday that he was known throughout the 
county for his fiscal acumen and passion for higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin was hired by the Ventura County Community College District in 1991, in 
the midst of a budget crisis that continues to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was well-known for his abilities to manage money and districts that were 
in financial problems and bring them into financial solvency," said Pete E. 
Tafoya, one of the governing board members who hired Lakin. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a wonderful boss and leader," said Barbara Buttner, a district 
official who worked directly under Lakin. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the special things I think about Thomas was that he had confidence in 
the people he put into positions of responsibility," she said. "He gave you an 
assignment and then left you free to be creative and soar as high as you 
could." 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin was a product of California schools, having graduated from high school 
in Los Angeles in 1961. He earned a bachelor's degree, a master's and a Ph.D. 
in education by 1972 -- all from UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1977, he was becoming a highly recruited administrator, and was hired as 
dean of instruction at Los Angeles Mission College, while teaching economics 
courses at Loyola Marymount University and Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin became a vice president at Los Angeles Trade Technical College in 1980, 
and was named president of Los Angeles Southwest College in 1986. He spent five 
years in that spot before accepting the chancellor position in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife, Karen, and two daughters, Ashley, 9, and Evin, 6. 
He also has two daughters from a previous marriage, Lesa and Lori, both of Los 
Angeles.

CALIFORNIA LEADS U.S. IN HOLIDAY BUYING KICKOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA K. H. WALTERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Californians pulled credit cards, checks and even some cold cash out of their 
wallets this past weekend, leading the country in the rousing start of the 1994 
holiday shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoppers around the state who used checks to pay for their purchases spent 
nearly 10% more Friday than they did a year ago. It was the largest increase of 
any state in the nation and is strong evidence that California is headed for a 
second straight season of higher sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers also said their California stores rang up strong sales, indicating 
that the state is continuing its rebound from the recession. And Southern 
Californians outspent their counterparts in the northern part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 If consumers in California and the rest of the country continue to give the 
Grinch the heave-ho throughout the monthlong shopping season, retailers said, 
1994 could be their best year since the national recession began eating into 
retail industry profits. 
</P>
<P>
 For California, the initial reports are a strong sign that consumers, if not 
entirely optimistic about the economy, are more confident about their ability 
to cope, said Richard Giss, a retail consultant in Los Angeles with the 
accounting firm Deloitte & Touche. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most retailers won't have solid numbers to report until today or 
later in the week, Deloitte & Touche's survey showed that shoppers Friday were 
"a little more loose with the purse strings," Giss said. 
</P>
<P>
 That confirms a study the firm did in October, in which California consumers 
reported feeling more secure in their jobs than a year ago. Holiday sales in 
California rebounded last year after three years of declines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a rotten economy for a while now, and people now feel they can deal 
with it," Giss said. 
</P>
<P>
 TeleCheck, a Houston-based company that is the world's largest 
check-authorizing firm, said sales by check rose 12.5% in San Diego on Friday, 
9.3% in the San Francisco Bay Area and 8.5% in the Los Angeles area over the 
same day last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 western states, with a 7.5% increase in sales, led all other regions, 
according to TeleCheck, even though sales were nearly flat in Colorado and 
Washington and down 7.5% in Hawaii. Sales for the entire nation were up 5.7%, 
the company said, matching most retailers' and analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual coincidence of Sunday evening's start of Hanukkah with the 
traditional Thanksgiving weekend introduction to the Christmas shopping period 
helped lift sales, as did markdowns and promotions by stores, credit card 
companies and shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
 For retailers, the holiday season is the goose's golden egg; it can account 
for more than half their entire year's sales. Generally, the weekend after 
Thanksgiving draws as many lookers as spenders, especially when it comes as 
early in November as it did this year. With a monthlong shopping period before 
Christmas, the stores' expectations for the weekend were modest. Many still 
believe that their highest single-day volume will come late in the season, as 
consumers continue the trend of waiting for last-minute markdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers have been doing all they can to counter that trend and offered 
treats and other incentives to early birds. And shoppers have responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Dayton-Hudson, which operates the Mervyn's and Target chains as well as 
higher-priced department stores, did "slightly better" in California than 
elsewhere, with hundreds of customers at several stores in the state lined up 
early in an imitation of Mervyn's "Open! Open! Open!" commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 In colder areas of the country, "outer wear benefited from a blast of cold 
air, and was a hot item," at Dayton-Hudson's department stores, company 
spokeswoman Gail Dorn said. She added that nationally, shoppers seemed to be in 
a jolly mood, buying items with holiday themes. 
</P>
<P>
 The lure of discounters continues to be strong. Consumers made poorer but 
wiser by the recession continue to hunt bargains even as they return to the 
clothing and home furnishing departments they slighted during harder times. 
</P>
<P>
 With many more discounters accepting plastic this year than last, credit-card 
sales have surged. Sales using MasterCard rose 36% to $763 million on Friday 
over the same day last year, and sales with that card increased 79% in the 
discount segment. Steve Apesos, spokesman for MasterCard International, said 
Visa and other credit card companies were registering similar gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Throngs of customers invaded I. Magnin stores, which are being liquidated as 
part of R. H. Macy & Co.'s emergence from bankruptcy and its merger with the 
Federated Department Stores chain. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 5,000 customers were reportedly awaiting the opening of the historic 
I. Magnin store on Union Square in San Francisco on Friday. When it did open, 
only 300 shoppers at a time were allowed in. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales for the entire Thanksgiving week were up about 7% over last year at 
stores operated by Macy, Chairman Myron E. Ullman III said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 High-ticket items such as jewelry and wide-screen televisions were among the 
strong sellers at stores in the giant Sears, Roebuck & Co. chain. John 
Costello, Sears' senior executive vice president for marketing, called the 
Friday-Saturday combination the best in the company's history.

AUDITS CAST SHADOW ON CHARTER SCHOOL'S FUTURE; EDUCATION: SPENDING CRITICIZED 
AT L.A. CAMPUS THAT ENROLLS DROPOUTS. BACKERS SAY PROBLEMS CAN BE FIXED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 While teachers lacked textbooks and supplies, the principal of Los Angeles' 
only charter school for dropouts drove an expensive school-leased sports car 
and staff members spent $7,000 on a secret retreat to Carmel, according to two 
outside audits. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics on the Los Angeles Unified School District board, which is to review 
the audits of Edutrain Charter School today, say documents provide ample 
evidence that it's time to abort the experiment, which started in July, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 If Edutrain closes its Grand Avenue doors, it will be the first charter school 
in the nation to fail since Minnesota enacted legislation to free some of its 
public schools from the bonds of their parent districts in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters say the management and financial audits merely detail severe 
growing pains, some of which they blame on vague and confusing state 
legislation. In hopes of persuading the Los Angeles Unified board to continue 
funding the school, Edutrain officials recently proposed an extensive 
reorganization that includes replacing both its top administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made some mistakes. The school made some errors in its first year of 
operation," Winston Doby, president of the Edutrain Board of Governors, told 
school board members earlier this month. "What we are asking you is to put the 
kinds of actions that occurred last year in perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 Edutrain's charter called for luring dropouts back to school and keeping them 
there by offering part-time classes and individualized instruction. At first it 
seemed wildly successful: Enrollment spiked to 500 students last spring and 68 
former dropouts graduated in a gala June ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Edutrain faltered, struggling awkwardly to keep pace with the rapid 
growth amid mounting internal turmoil and outside scrutiny. This fall, only 100 
students showed up for classes, and in October two dozen teachers and staff 
members were laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a financial audit by KPMG Peat Marwick Co. has found the school is nearly 
$1 million in debt and owes at least $240,000 more to Los Angeles Unified for 
students it anticipated in the fall but who never enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, no one is alleging intentional wrongdoing at Edutrain. But questions 
abound about how the school spent its money and whether it has the 
administrative and financial fortitude to resurrect itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial audit indicates that the school's future depends on persuading 
Los Angeles Unified to accept its reorganization plan and on more than doubling 
its student enrollment within the next two months. 
</P>
<P>
 In past meetings, the school board has been divided, lauding Edutrain's 
efforts to salvage dropouts but expressing concern with the apparent lack of 
oversight and general disorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there was any malice, but I can't say we should continue to 
spend public funds on a school that has had this many problems in such a short 
time," Los Angeles Unified board member Leticia Quezada said during a Nov. 14 
special meeting. "In the charter school movement . . . it's going to be very 
critical that the community schools are above reproach." 
</P>
<P>
 Edutrain is one of the state's first 100 charter schools, allowed under 1992 
legislation to operate independently with the permission of local school 
boards. Los Angeles Unified is responsible for granting charter contracts 
within its boundaries and ensuring that the schools live up to their own 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified board members plan to review information from the two 
Edutrain audits today, then decide next Monday whether to let the school 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Their ultimate decision is complicated by Edutrain's debt -- much of which is 
owed to UCLA for start-up costs -- because state charter school legislation 
does not clearly delineate who would have to repay that money if the school 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a factor that should be taken into account in granting them additional 
time, because it's a way to get them to pay off that debt," said Rich Mason, 
general counsel for Los Angeles Unified. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the spending decisions questioned in district excerpts of the management 
audit by K. H. Consulting Group -- which have not been publicly released -- are 
perks Edutrain provided to administrators that far exceed benefits offered 
other public school administrators. Among them are the lease of a $39,000 
sports car for school President Keith Turnage, payment of $500 a month toward 
the rental of his Mt. Washington home and the hiring of a bodyguard to protect 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 The management audit also questioned the wisdom of a $7,000 Carmel retreat for 
a select group of 13 staff members and the $22,000 cost of last year's 
graduation ceremony -- held at the Los Angeles Convention Center -- which 
amounted to about $325 per graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 Edutrain board members have defended the price of staging an elaborate 
graduation and said they have been unable to confirm that the Carmel retreat 
took place. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have acknowledged that they erred in agreeing to furnish Turnage a 
fancy car and offset some of his rent to compensate him for housing students 
and holding school events in his home. They said they reversed those decisions 
in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Several respected educators and business people sit on Edutrain's board, 
including Doby, who is vice chancellor of student affairs at UCLA; Darick 
Simpson, project director for the L.A. Minority Business Development Center; 
restaurateur Jean-Claude Sakoun, and Virgil Roberts, a record company executive 
and board member for the LEARN school reform movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Los Angeles Unified board members have said they consider many of the 
expenditures excessive, particularly when Edutrain teachers told the auditors 
that they had to make do without sufficient textbooks and other essential 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used our own books in our classrooms, ones we brought from home," said one 
former teacher who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Several current and former teachers told The Times that the school frequently 
ran out of toilet paper and the telephones were disconnected once because the 
bill had not been paid. 
</P>
<P>
 The management audit also asked why Edutrain had spent nearly $30,000 on 
furnishings. At the Nov. 14 board meeting, Doby said that the money had 
purchased desks and chairs for the school. Some teachers, however, said they 
and their students were left with used chairs and ripped curtains while 
administrators worked in top-floor offices filled with new desks, wall-to-wall 
carpeting and vertical blinds. 
</P>
<P>
 District board member Jeff Horton described the spending on administrators as 
"just self-serving 'I wanna act and be rich.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Also troubling to the district board are allegations in the management audit 
that underage students were housed in four school-funded apartments and in 
Turnage's own home, and that in some cases girls and boys were allowed to live 
together without supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Nov. 14 meeting, board President Mark Slavkin said Edutrain should have 
asked permission from Los Angeles Unified to "deviate from the charter . . . 
and provide overnight housing." 
</P>
<P>
 The school responded that the housing was reserved mostly for students over 
the age of 18 and then only in extreme situations, such as when they became 
homeless, were being abused at home or when their parents traveled out of their 
parole area. About 15% of Edutrain's students are on parole and at least 85% 
have arrest records. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some students interviewed by the auditors charged that the school 
housing and accompanying clothing allowances were doled out based on a system 
of favoritism, not need, and that the apartments were widely known as party 
pads. 
</P>
<P>
 Allegations of favoritism extended to hiring decisions as well, according to 
the management audit, which described Edutrain as "nepotism heaven." Nearly a 
fifth of the employees were related, the auditors found, and staff members 
reported that job descriptions were sometimes crafted to match the skills of 
desired hires. 
</P>
<P>
 A core group of teachers, many of whom helped found the school, were paid 
$70,000 annual salaries -- more than twice what other Edutrain teachers 
received. One top administrator allegedly received nearly half his salary as 
expense reimbursement in an apparent attempt, the audit said, to prevent the 
money from being tapped for child support payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the relative autonomy of charter schools meant that Los Angeles Unified 
only learned of the troubles at Edutrain after a random visit last May by a 
state financial analyst who was curious about how the school had designed its 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Pillsbury, an analyst with the state Department of Finance, found far 
fewer students in classes and roll books than the number for which Edutrain was 
being funded. Pillsbury brought his discovery to the attention of Los Angeles 
Unified administrators, whose initial investigation turned up conflicting 
answers and sloppy roll-book keeping. 
</P>
<P>
 The auditor with K. H. Consulting Group reported a similar experience when 
seeking financial records, saying they were incomplete and in disarray. 
</P>
<P>
 A former teacher, who requested anonymity, charged that Edutrain 
administrators became "power hungry" but that no one outside the school knew 
because Edutrain lacked oversight: The school's own board met once a month or 
less and Edutrain is the only Los Angeles Unified charter school where teachers 
agreed not to be represented by a union. 
</P>
<P>
 That lack of outside eyes left crucial decisions in the hands of a few top 
administrators, the teacher said, none of whom had ever managed their own 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Doby, the Edutrain board president, conceded that key administrators were not 
qualified to manage a school as large as Edutrain. But he has consistently 
maintained that it was an overzealous entrepreneurial spirit seeking to meet an 
unexpected demand, not a thirst for power, that dragged the school down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it reveals some of the weaknesses of the charter school movement," 
said Los Angeles Unified board member Horton. "Namely, that some kind of 
entrepreneurial spirit is sufficient to meet the needs of students. This, to 
me, is a proof that it isn't necessarily."

 Caught pinching a $100 pair of earrings for the first time in Orange County? 
The typical punishment: a day in jail, three years probation, a $150 fine and a 
criminal record. Commit the same crime in Los Angeles County? You could attend 
an eight-hour petty theft school and get the charges dropped. And in Sacramento 
County, keep your record clean by completing a correspondence course. 
</P>
<P>
 Provide sex for cash in Sacramento, and go to prostitute school. In Ventura, 
go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexually abuse a son or daughter in five Northern California counties and you 
might keep it off the record books by attending a program for child molesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Most everywhere else: state prison and registration as a sex offender. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to California's crazy quilt of court diversion programs, where the 
path to justice can meander through the mail as well as through jail. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the traffic schools of the '90s, where an overburdened justice 
system increasingly farms out its first-time petty thieves, drug offenders, 
spouse abusers, flashers and barroom brawlers. 
</P>
<P>
 The private, largely for-profit programs are spottily regulated and largely 
unproven. Access to them varies from judge to judge, sometimes in the same 
courthouse. Yet the programs increasingly are viewed as the only alternative to 
overcrowded jails and overworked probation staffs -- although some judges admit 
they often have no idea who's running the programs or if they work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fairly disgusted with a lot of these programs, because they don't do any 
good," said Orange County Municipal Judge Margaret Anderson. "We really don't 
have any control over them." 
</P>
<P>
 In most counties, there is too little funding and too few personnel to give 
the programs and their owners more than a cursory once-over. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1979, California's Penal Code Section 1000 has allowed use of diversion 
programs for drug users, spouse abusers and some child molesters. Some 
prosecutors have expanded that list to include a range of misdemeanors from 
resisting arrest to maiming animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Four counties now allow petty thieves, drug offenders, embezzlers, vandals and 
others to avoid jail through a correspondence course run by a couple in Sandy, 
Utah. In Sacramento, cock-fighters can keep their records clean by completing 
the company's 40-page workbook, which has the tough crime-busting theme: "If 
you want to soar with the eagles, you can't flock with the turkeys!" 
</P>
<P>
 And short-staffed probation departments often rely on the offenders to confirm 
their own eligibility for the programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Many counties don't -- or can't -- keep track of how many people are in 
diversion classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just as screwed up as it appears to be," said Suzie Cohen, executive 
director of the association that represents California's probation, parole and 
correctional officers. "If somebody doesn't show up (for counseling) and the 
program doesn't notify us, it could be months before the probation officer 
knows" to inform the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Although state law says that only first-time offenders are eligible, programs 
often contain repeat offenders or those who have been through diversion, both 
clients and program providers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, smart defense attorneys are finding ways to shoehorn more dangerous 
assault suspects into programs designed for first-time spouse abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some attorneys and judges contend the disparity in punishment from county to 
county also amounts to unequal justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you take a serious offense, an assault case, and in one county the person 
gets diversion and in another county he gets two years in the state prison, 
that's not right," said Dick Iglehart, ex-Alameda County chief deputy district 
attorney and now chief counsel for the Assembly's Public Safety Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the programs designed to teach petty crooks to mend their ways have 
their roots in the formerly big-money world of traffic schools. That 
freewheeling boom went bust in 1992, when a new state law forced offenders to 
pay both the ticket fine and the traffic school fee. Offenders could still keep 
their records clean by going, but it wasn't cheap. Attendance plummeted by 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 Big traffic school operators, such as National Traffic Safety Institute -- 
based in Salem, Ore., and also known as the National Training Systems Institute 
-- focused on new moneymakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the company, which pioneered the Saturday traffic school in Santa Clara 
County in the mid-1970s, not only offers traffic classes, but ones for drug 
users, petty thieves, child safety belt offenders and batterers. Last year the 
company -- with 800,000 students nationwide -- made an estimated $30 million to 
$40 million, a manager said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't make it just on traffic school anymore," said Jim Brierly, National 
Traffic Safety Institute's Southern California regional manager in Santa Ana, 
whose job includes networking with judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Often taught by former traffic school teachers, the multi-service, 
multi-county programs -- tucked into business parks and mini-malls -- counsel 
drunk drivers next door to spouse abusers next door to men who exposed 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 As in traffic school, if offenders complete the programs -- which can range 
from 52 weeks for domestic violence classes to an eight-hour marijuana school 
-- the charges are dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorneys, judges and probation officials admit that rarely does 
anyone check on the instructors' qualifications or whether the programs 
actually work in changing behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of it is really a shot in the dark," said Los Angeles Municipal Judge 
Andrew C. Kauffman, who nevertheless favors diversion as the only alternative 
to the vacuum created by shrinking probation resources. "We don't know which 
programs are good." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, more than 400 people accused of petty crimes in Sacramento County are 
serving their time by watching a video and completing workbook exercises at 
home. So are dozens of people in Yolo, San Bernardino, San Luis Obispo and 
Santa Clara counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of spending a Saturday in a classroom, these offenders must complete a 
correspondence course run by Western Corrections, the Utah mom-and-pop company 
launched as a traffic school 14 years ago. The company has workbooks for 148 
offenses, said founder Jeff Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on their crime, offenders send in $125 or $225 for a workbook heavy 
with the jargon of self-esteem and a home movie-quality video of a class 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 Sample workbook questions: Why is it important that you avoid committing a 
crime? When it comes right down to the bottom line, who is responsible for your 
actions? Indicate what the chances are that you will commit another crime: 
definitely, maybe or never. 
</P>
<P>
 A workbook exercise asked offenders to "list the positives and negatives of 
crime." A 22-year-old pizza parlor manager who had shoplifted listed "money" 
and "cool" under the positives and "fear," "no money" and "frustrating" under 
the negatives. 
</P>
<P>
 A Northern California mother of two attributed her shoplifting to 
antidepressants. To the question, "What are the steps you can take to avoid 
stealing again?" she answered, "No. 1. Not take Zoloft." 
</P>
<P>
 Many program providers say the issue isn't whether the programs are good, but 
which have the sweetest sales pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all politics," said Linda Polinsky, director of Auburn, Calif.-based 
Pacific Educational Services, which started out as a traffic school in 1979 and 
runs classes for everyone from prostitutes to child abusers. "It doesn't matter 
if you're a good program or a bad program." 
</P>
<P>
 In today's courtrooms, some judges said, they only have time to perform 
triage, deciding quickly which cases belong in the justice system and which 
don't. Diversion is the Band-Aid placed on those considered to be minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Thompson, Sacramento County's chief deputy district attorney, said his 
office faced the Hobson's choice of the criminal justice process: Use programs 
such as the Utah correspondence course, or abandon prosecution of many 
misdemeanor cases altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does it work?" asked Thompson. "Compared to what? Compared to paying a $100 
fine for petty theft? I think it does. It's certainly more effective than the 
option of nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Thompson and other diversion supporters say, the penalty of attending 
the programs often is much harsher -- both financially and timewise -- than the 
one a misdemeanor offender would have received from the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 After a drunken spat with his wife, a 30-year-old armored car guard named 
Leroy was shocked to find himself in a yearlong domestic violence program that 
cost $1,300. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Tuesday night, he joined 10 men at California Diversion 
Intervention Foundation's West Los Angeles office. Goaded by the sharp tongue 
of counselor Priscilla Roulet-Jones, the men talked about their attempts to 
communicate with their wives. 
</P>
<P>
 One tattooed former gang member and heroin addict spoke of how he used to come 
home late, afraid his wife would be lying in wait to stab him. Now, he said, 
before the yelling starts he tells his wife, "Priscilla said we should talk." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the program is "tough, but it's made my marriage better," Leroy 
said. "Everybody's got the same problems. That really helps." 
</P>
<P>
 But diversion program instructors said the criminal justice system often 
allows people into the programs by reducing their charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "They plead them down to get them in," Roulet-Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men who shot at police officers have recently completed her "domestic 
violence" class, she said, as have two people who got in a fight at work, and a 
man who punched a supermarket cashier. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino County Deputy Dist. Atty. Gordon Isen said prosecutors are 
sometimes pressured to revise the charges to allow for diversion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen where assault with a deadly weapon on a wife or girlfriend is 
modified to allow for a diversion program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a scathing 1990 study of California's domestic violence programs, Kurt R. 
Sjoberg -- the state auditor -- said the quality of the programs and the types 
of people referred to them ranged from the responsible to the absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was most troubling that a batterer could be (diverted from) the 
criminal justice system and basically do nothing to change his criminal 
behavior," he said recently. "We had incidents where they'd go to class and 
leave. They didn't confront their behavior at all. But they avoided the 
penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 Program providers say some people try to buy their way out of attending. 
Roulet-Jones said a movie producer came to a drug diversion class last year 
loaded with ringing cellular phones and beepers. When she told him that he'd 
have to leave the hardware outside, the man framed her face with his hands and 
said, "You look so great. I've got a role for you in my new movie." 
</P>
<P>
 But Roulet-Jones and other operators said probation departments and the courts 
have begun to require increasing numbers of reports to ensure compliance by 
both offenders and providers. 
</P>
<P>
 Like everything else in court diversion, fees vary widely. 
</P>
<P>
 At National Traffic Safety Institute, petty theft school costs $45 for a 
single eight-hour class. At California Diversion Intervention Foundation, with 
seven offices in Los Angeles and Orange counties, an accused petty thief must 
attend eight 1 1/2-hour sessions at a cost of about $200. Some Northern 
California petty thieves can complete a workbook for $125. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term programs for serious offenses, such as domestic violence, can cost 
much more. 
</P>
<P>
 An 18-year-old from Fullerton ended up in California Diversion Intervention 
Foundation's domestic violence class after a hair-pulling, face-slapping battle 
with her mother. The tab: $800 for 32 sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 After being arrested at a Sav-On Drugs in Orange for forging a prescription 
for a powerful painkiller, Debra Magedman, 39, ended up in the company's 
Thursday night drug diversion class. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost: $25 a week for 20 weeks, $50 for each missed session, and random 
drug tests at $37.40 apiece. Grand total: roughly $700, not including any bail. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cost is relative, said Magedman, a spiky-haired blonde who drives a 
Mercedes and was wearing a mink-edged sweater when she was arrested. "I was 
facing six months (in jail). After my program is done, it will be taken off my 
record," said Magedman, who credits the program with forcing her to kick 
painkillers. 
</P>
<P>
 Had she shopped around, she might have gotten a better deal from Virginia 
Florez-Kelly's Second Chance Diversion across town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am the lowest-charging program in the county," said Florez-Kelly, a 
Riverside County social worker who moonlights running the one-woman drug 
diversion program. But still, she said, it's a "moneymaker." 
</P>
<P>
 At Second Chance, Magedman could have completed the program for $270. And 
instead of attending every week -- which most counties require -- she could 
have done the course in a couple of weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't make them come once a week because I don't come once a week," 
Florez-Kelly said. "That's the way I set up my practice -- the hours I want to 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Diversion program supporters and critics say that recently enacted laws could 
correct some of the problems. A law that becomes effective Jan. 1 will put drug 
diversion programs under the eye of county health care agencies. And 
legislation that took effect five months ago calls for more oversight of 
domestic violence diversion programs by county probation departments. 
</P>
<P>
 But judges and probation officials concede that without more staff it will be 
tough to carry out their new responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if we monitor providers, we're lucky if we can do that once a year," 
said Kathy Miller, an Orange County Probation Department official. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her office can't even fulfill some of the responsibilities it 
shouldered in the past. The department used to complete pre-sentence reports to 
determine if people were eligible for diversion, but "a couple of years ago we 
said we couldn't do that anymore. I don't know what information the court gets 
before they send them to diversion." 
</P>
<P>
 One coordinator, who asked that her name not be used, said that when probation 
officials do come to check the programs, "They tell us when they're coming. 
You'd have to be a complete moron if you were doing something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Different counties have different standards for teachers. In Orange County, a 
domestic violence program instructor must have a graduate degree or be 
supervised by someone with a counseling degree. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, one year's field experience is required but educational 
background is not, said Jane Clausen, a Los Angeles County probation official. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she knew of no agency that monitors programs for such things as petty 
theft, minor sexual offenses or child abuse, and no lists of approved programs 
are maintained. "We don't really have the expertise to review them." 
</P>
<P>
 In cases such as petty theft, Clausen said, people can find their own program, 
complete it and report back to probation officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in the justice system say that, for better or worse, the future might be 
similar to the system in Sacramento County, home of the state's only prostitute 
and "john" diversion programs, and one of the few places that allows people who 
molest young family members to receive counseling in lieu of prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Thompson said Sacramento County turned to diversion 
programs when budget cuts threatened one-third of his staff of misdemeanor 
prosecutors, and "we did not want to abandon the prosecution of misdemeanor 
crimes." But his office also embraced diversion because misdemeanor offenders 
seldom ended up doing time, even when they were prosecuted, "because there was 
no room in the jails." 
</P>
<P>
 Prostitutes and their customers arrested for the first time now can avoid jail 
by attending school: a 24-hour, two-weekend, self-esteem workshop for the 
prostitutes and a 12-hour school for their customers. In other counties, a 
prostitute would typically get 30 days in jail for a first conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Polinsky, director of the Pacific Educational Services program, said about 
half the prostitutes and 100% of the johns show up. In the last three years, 
500 prostitutes and 1,500 johns have been through the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Polinsky said diversion is appropriate for "victimless" crimes such as 
prostitution, and just might stop a cycle before it starts. 
</P>
<P>
 But does she know if her programs work? "No. I wish I did."

GINGRICH OFFERS A COMPLEX VISION OF AMERICA'S FUTURE; POLITICS: HIS VIEWS ARE 
LIKELY TO DRIVE POLICY DEBATES. BUT SOME WONDER IF HIS BELIEFS CAN BE 
TRANSLATED INTO LAW. 
</P>

<P>
 "I've always told all of you I was not nearly as radical as some of my 
friends," Rep. Newt Gingrich said in a post-election speech in which he backed 
away from a colleague's proposal to scrap the federal income tax in favor of a 
national sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
 But the very next day, the Georgia Republican who is in line to become Speaker 
of the House took a strikingly different tack. He talked nonchalantly on a 
television program about slashing half a trillion dollars from federal 
spending; dismantling the Americans With Disabilities Act, an ornament of the 
George Bush Administration, and removing low-income single mothers from the 
welfare rolls, leaving them dependent on the beneficence of private charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the 51-year-old Gingrich really the radical conservative his critics see or 
a self-described moderate one? Or is the former West Georgia College history 
teacher in a category all his own? 
</P>
<P>
 The questions are more than rhetorical. In the aftermath of the Republican 
takeover of Congress -- of which he was a primary orchestrator -- Gingrich has 
emerged as the politician of the moment. His views on a host of crucial 
subjects -- from the value of work to the meaning of family -- have recently 
overshadowed those of both President Clinton, with whom he has refused to 
compromise on matters of principle, and Senate Republican leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.), whom he long ago dismissed as "the tax collector for the welfare 
state." 
</P>
<P>
 His wide-ranging vision of America is almost certain to drive public-policy 
debates during the next Congress and perhaps the 1996 presidential campaign and 
beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know him best attribute Gingrich's world view in large part to his 
life as the stepson of an Army officer in the rural South and as an academic in 
a small Southern college that gave him the freedom to roam intellectually. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich himself recalls a boyhood visit to the World War I battlefield at 
Verdun, France, as a experience that impressed on him the potentially enormous 
consequences of decisions made by those who wield political power. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Eisenach, head of the Progress and Freedom Foundation, a think tank 
that works closely with Gingrich, put it this way: "Newt's outlook is the 
result of a remarkable intellect combined with an Army brat who has seen the 
connection between action and results." Whatever the reasons, he has gone 
farther than most of his peers in developing a network of ideas both broad and 
detailed." 
</P>
<P>
 "His big thing is the big picture," said Republican strategist Kevin Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich contends that the breadth of his beliefs is not just a virtue but a 
necessity if they are to be fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 "An opportunity society requires a dynamic, expanding vision of freedom and 
the future," he wrote in "Window of Opportunity," the book he published in 1984 
and which he still draws on heavily for his public utterances. "If people . . . 
see a vision powerful enough, they will commit themselves to a thousand-mile 
march. Without that vision, they are unlikely to move at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The most conspicuous evidence of that vision during the midterm election 
campaign was the GOP's "contract with America." But this compendium of such 
Ronald Reagan-inspired ideas as a balanced-budget amendment to the 
Constitution, congressional term limits and tax cuts -- all of which Gingrich 
has pledged to take up in the new Congress' first 100 days -- represents only 
the tip of Gingrich's ideology. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a brief look at the main pillars of Gingrich's deeper thinking, based 
on his utterances and on his book. 
</P>
<P>
 Back to the future: Literally defined, "futurism," one of Gingrich's favorite 
buzzwords, is a point of view that seeks life's meaning in the future, rather 
than in the present. But Gingrich, who calls himself a "conservative futurist," 
takes a somewhat different approach, relying on his faith in the future to 
recapture the best of the past and redirect the present. Harking back to the 
GOP's role as the nation's dominant and activist party in the closing years of 
the 19th Century, freshman Rep. Gingrich told an interviewer: "I'm a modernizer 
who is suggesting (that) we leap back an entire span and claim our own heritage 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking ahead, Gingrich is dazzled by an abundance of "high-technology 
options" that he argues can help rid American society of the decadence 
inflicted upon it by more than half a century of liberal Democratic hegemony. 
He is particularly engaged by futurist writer Alvin Toffler's concept of 
"triliteracy," combining the traditional three R's of learning with the mass 
media and computer technology. Once Americans have mastered triliteracy, 
Gingrich claims, "there will be a tremendous increase not only in America's 
productivity but also in each individual's creativity as people learn to 
retrain themselves in order to find their own paths to wisdom and knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 One path favored by Gingrich is to require the House to file all its official 
documents electronically, making them generally available by computer and 
producing, he contends, a better-informed and more active citizenry. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual empowerment: By freeing Americans from big government and high 
taxes, Gingrich hopes to unleash the energies of individual enterprise and 
ambition. Like Charles Murray, author of "Losing Ground" and "The Bell Curve," 
and other critics of the welfare state, Gingrich argues that breaking the back 
of the welfare bureaucracy would benefit not only middle-class taxpayers but 
the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich contends that the current federal approach to welfare is based on 
what he calls redistributionist economics and counterculture values, and he 
argues that the inevitable result is to "ruin the poor" and "create a culture 
of poverty and a culture of violence which is destructive of this 
civilization." 
</P>
<P>
 The poor stand to gain the most, Gingrich says, if the paralyzing culture of 
poverty can be replaced with the opportunity for productivity. Meanwhile, 
middle-class Americans would also get a chance at greater self-fulfillment by 
being encouraged to work years past the so-called "prime" through the 
relaxation of current limits on retirement income. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Gingrich's new world, opportunity carries with it an enlarged burden of 
civic responsibility. "You cannot hire a teacher to teach your child and walk 
off and then blame the teacher," he said. "You cannot hire a policeman to 
protect your neighborhood and then walk off and blame the police." Citizens who 
want to reduce the power of Washington "have to take more responsibility back 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional values: Certainly the most emotional and probably the most 
compelling item in Gingrich's ideological inventory is his emphasis on the 
restoration of traditional values. Nothing less than the survival of America 
depends on the success of this effort, he said in his first major address since 
the election. "It is impossible to maintain civilization with 12-year-olds 
having babies, with 15-year-olds killing each other, with 17-year-olds dying of 
AIDS and with 18-year-olds ending up with diplomas they can't even read," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gingrich puts some of the blame for social decay on federal policies 
and programs, notably welfare, he also condemns what he calls the dominant 
liberal culture, which he complains has put more emphasis on material goods and 
systems than on "the power of the mind and the spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the results he lists are more schoolchildren cheating on tests, more 
taxpayers cheating on their 1040 tax forms and "more freedom to read 
pornography," but "less satisfaction from our personal relationships." 
</P>
<P>
 To revive the nation's neglected soul, Gingrich calls for a religious 
renaissance -- one reason a constitutional amendment allowing prayer in schools 
is high on his legislative agenda. Gingrich also contends that time is on the 
side of boosting moral standards, suggesting that as the baby boomer generation 
grays, its members, recognizing "the failure of both radical hedonism and 
economic materialism" will swell the congregations of the country's churches. 
</P>
<P>
 New internationalism: Gingrich sees the need for the United States to assert 
its interests abroad more effectively, particularly in the field of 
international economics. Americans must understand, Gingrich says, that only by 
achieving the world's highest levels of productivity can they be rewarded with 
the world's highest standard of living. Accomplishing this, he declared in a 
recent speech, requires a sweeping and uncompromising reassessment of 
government along with the rest of society. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to literally rethink the assumptions that grew up in a self-indulgent 
national economy and recognize that litigation, taxation, regulation, welfare, 
education, the very structure of government, the structure of health, all these 
things have to be re-examined," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich did not make clear how much of a role he would want government to 
play in intensifying the nation's efforts to compete abroad, and most analysts 
doubt that he would support much direct involvement along the lines of the 
industrial policy approach favored by some liberal economists. 
</P>
<P>
 But University of Wisconsin political scientist Charles O. Jones, who is 
familiar with Gingrich's thinking, said he believes that the lawmaker would 
favor having the government "facilitate" efforts to bolster U.S. global 
competitiveness through such measures as selective tax breaks at home and trade 
agreements abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 A redoubtable Cold Warrior all his years in Congress, Gingrich also has long 
sounded the alarm about international terrorism. It remains a grave threat to 
the nation's security in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union, he 
contends. In "Window of Opportunity," he warned: "A free, open society cannot 
survive by trading violence for violence. If we kill an Iranian extremist every 
time Iranians kill an American soldier, we will lose the struggle." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Gingrich called for the United States to develop the capacity to 
strike back directly at the leaders of terrorist movements in a manner that 
would be so effective it would make them avoid attacks on Americans out of fear 
for their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
 How much of what Gingrich believes can be translated into law will depend on a 
multitude of factors, some outside his control -- such as the strategic 
thinking of the Democratic opposition in the House and Senate, the Democratic 
President in the White House and dissenters within his own party. 
</P>
<P>
 Much will also depend on his ability to master the skills required of a 
majority leader. Critics and even some supporters question whether he can curb 
his tendency to indulge in distracting rhetorical outbursts. They need not 
search far for an example. In the closing days of the midterm campaigns, he 
suggested that the case of the South Carolina mother accused of drowning her 
two young sons demonstrated the sickness of society and a reason to vote 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 After he was roundly criticized for the remark, Gingrich claimed that he was 
quoted out of context. A longtime colleague, former Minnesota Republican Rep. 
Vin Weber, attributed the lapse to Gingrich's zeal in finding evidence to 
support his ideological approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gets up and reads the paper in the morning and everything that's in it 
fits into his world view," Weber said. "He's very sincere, but his mind makes 
leaps and other people can't make the connections he does." 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts contend that even if Gingrich can pass much of his program, his 
success may do him and his party more harm than good. On the values front, he 
may be building up expectations for change that cannot be accomplished by any 
statute. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's talking about a series of problems with which national government has 
never been directly involved and about which the national government finds it 
very hard to do anything constructive," said University of North Carolina 
historian William Leuchtenburg, referring to Gingrich's lament about teen-age 
illiteracy, pregnancy and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 On the economic front, GOP strategist Phillips contends that the 
balanced-budget amendment Gingrich is pushing "has the potential to turn into 
the Republican equivalent of Clinton's health care." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to sound good when you start out with it," Phillips said. But he 
predicted that support would "drop sharply as soon as people find out it's 
going to cut into their Social Security or benefits or raise their taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever happens, some who know Gingrich believe that he is flexible 
enough to handle it. To reach the pinnacle of power in the House he has already 
traveled a long and circuitous road. 
</P>
<P>
 This national spokesman for militant conservatism broke into the politics of 
what is now his home state in 1968 as a supporter of the presidential candidacy 
of then-New York Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, the chief spokesman for liberal 
Republicanism and the Republican conservatives most loved to hate. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a year when my first choice, Ronald Reagan, wasn't running," 
Gingrich recalled in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first races for Congress, Gingrich was regarded as a moderate for his 
positions on race and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Even today, after nearly two decades of his fighting the right's fights on 
Capitol Hill, some conservatives question his dependability. "I think he's more 
of a political strategist than an ideologue," said David Keene, chairman of the 
American Conservative Union. "He is not a consistent conservative in the 
traditional sense. I think his conservatism is more strategic in orientation. I 
think he would be far more likely to use government if he thought government 
could do the right things." 
</P>
<P>
 But for all these misgivings, Keene is content to have Gingrich in his present 
position. "To Gingrich's credit, he was the only person who saw this (GOP 
victory) coming. He built for it and was prepared for it. This election result 
was really a tribute to two people -- Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton."

FISSURES EMERGE WITHIN GOP OVER 'CONTRACT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The opening bell of the 104th Congress will not ring for another six weeks, 
but Capitol Hill's bookmakers have already reached one conclusion about the 
odds that the House Republicans' ambitious "contract with America" will be 
enacted into law: 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to political contracts, not all promises are created equal. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-point contract commits House Republicans to a series of up-or-down 
floor votes on a wide range of tax cuts, spending reductions, welfare reforms 
and constitutional changes in the first 100 days of the new legislative 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 Drafted by likely incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia and endorsed 
by many GOP lawmakers, the contract contains much that Republicans agree on. 
But it is also studded with a number of provisions on which there is anything 
but a consensus within GOP ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, some Republicans are talking privately about trying to split the 
contract's agenda into two parts. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, there are the things that we really need to try to pass and get 
enacted into law with (President) Clinton's signature," said a senior 
Republican source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "And then there are 
the things that we need to vote for, but that some of us won't be terribly 
upset to see the Democrats kill, or Clinton veto, so they can take blame for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 A constitutional balanced-budget amendment, the line-item presidential veto, 
welfare reform and some mix of tax cuts are clearly in the first category of 
what Republicans regard as must-pass legislation. Although it is not in the 
contract, voluntary school prayer is another highly popular item that the 
Republicans promise to push early. 
</P>
<P>
 The new GOP committee chairmen, who face the delicate task of reconciling 
intraparty differences with the rest of the agenda, will determine which 
initiatives are shifted to the second category: too hot to handle on a fast 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 One provision that clearly seems headed in that direction is a limit on how 
many congressional terms members of Congress may serve. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republicans face a real dilemma over term limits," said Larry Sabato, a 
political scientist at the University of Virginia. "Most of them don't really 
want to limit their terms, but on the other hand, many Republicans made term 
limits a top issue in their campaigns, and it is one of the most popular issues 
that they endorsed." 
</P>
<P>
 The new GOP leadership in the House discounts these emerging fissures by 
noting that Republicans will have no choice but to support the contract's main 
themes if they want to remain in the majority two years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't make good on the contract . . . if we just conduct ourselves 
around here like it's business as usual, then we will meet with the same demise 
that the Democrats met this time," warned Rep. Jim Nussle (R-Iowa), who heads 
the House GOP transition team. 
</P>
<P>
 "A contract is a contract," said William Schneider, a political analyst with 
the American Enterprise Institute. "The voters have delivered on their end of 
it," he said, and Republicans "must at least now make a sincere effort to carry 
out their promises." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if Republicans would support a constitutional amendment to limit their 
terms now that they were in the majority, Gingrich noted that the GOP contract 
promised only to put the issue to a vote. It does not, he said, commit members 
to vote for limits. 
</P>
<P>
 And even if a constitutional amendment achieved the necessary two-thirds 
majority in the House, it would be unlikely to do so in the Senate, where the 
Republicans' partisan advantage is only 53 to 47. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure that term limits will pass the House, but if it does, there are 
a lot of us who will have voted for it on the assumption that the Senate will 
save us," a senior GOP lawmaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats, still nursing their wounds from the electoral drubbing that will 
put Republicans in charge of both the House and Senate for the first time in 
four decades, plan to exploit any such divisions in the GOP ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like we did before them, the Republicans are about to learn that keeping a 
promise is often a lot harder than breaking it," said a senior Democratic House 
aide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone agrees that we have to fulfill the contract because we will have set 
ourselves up for a major political fall in two years if we don't pass it," said 
a senior House GOP aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all Republicans, for instance, are on record as supporting tax 
reductions. But the specific cuts called for by the contract do not enjoy 
universal backing. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP deficit hawks are arguing privately that the arithmetic of passing a 
capital gains tax cut, enacting a $500-per-child tax credit for families and 
repealing the "marriage penalty" in the existing tax code simply does not 
square with the GOP's promise to increase defense spending and a congressional 
commitment to keep the federal budget deficit under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, there is broad support within Republican ranks for education 
reform. But the incoming GOP chairman of the House Education and Labor 
Committee has already declared himself to be strongly opposed to the contract's 
key proposal for school vouchers that students could use to buy education at 
public or private schools of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp differences are also emerging over the GOP leadership's plan to 
reorganize and reduce the number of congressional committees and cut back the 
size of committee staffs by at least one-third. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans are committed in principle to streamlining the congressional 
bureaucracy, but a number of incoming GOP committee chairmen are chagrined that 
their new fiefdoms are about to be shrunk even before they get the keys to the 
castle. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr. (R-Va.), the likely chairman of the House Energy and 
Commerce Committee, has indicated he will fight plans to sharply narrow his 
jurisdiction. A source close to the transition efforts conceded that GOP 
resistance could force Gingrich to settle for more modest changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the pledge to reorganize and shrink Congress will probably prove easier 
to keep than some of the other promises outlined in the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 A pledge to bar U.S. troops from participating in U.N. peacekeeping missions 
that are not under American command is expected to run into opposition from 
Republicans on both sides of the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign-finance reform faces its own set of hurdles. In the last two years of 
the George Bush Administration, Democrats pushed through their version of 
reform legislation, safe in the knowledge that Bush would veto it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last Congress, a weaker version of the same bill had a much tougher 
time passing because House Democrats knew that Clinton would not veto it. In 
the end, many Democrats reluctantly voted for a bill that they secretly hoped 
Senate Republicans would kill, which they did. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Senate Republicans, who did not sign the contract, might perform the same 
service in the new GOP-dominated Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The composition of the GOP transition teams illustrates the differences 
between the House and Senate. The House team includes eight incoming freshmen 
who embraced the contract and campaigned for radical change; the three-member 
Senate team is composed of lawmakers with nearly 35 years of Senate service 
among them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to have a coordinated and coherent legislative strategy," said Sen. 
Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), the leader of the Senate team, adding that the Senate 
might not endorse every item in the House GOP agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our rules are different here in the Senate than they are in the House . . . 
," he said. "And on some of the issues, welfare reform for example, we don't 
all agree." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Republicans support tax cuts, added Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.), but 
they do not necessarily embrace all those enumerated in the House contract 
because "we also want to be responsible. . . . We don't want to increase the 
deficit and we want to cut spending at the same time." 'Contract With America'

U.S. SEES NO HOPE OF STOPPING SERBS' TAKEOVER OF BIHAC; BALKANS: PERRY SAYS 
NATO STRIKES WOULD BE USELESS, SIGNALS SEA CHANGE IN AMERICAN STANCE ON BOSNIA. 
REBELS ADVANCE; U.N. PEACEKEEPERS BEGIN MOVES TO LEAVE COUNTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a pessimistic assessment of the Bosnian conflict, Defense Secretary William 
J. Perry said Sunday that heavily armed Serbian rebels advancing on the 
teetering city of Bihac are unstoppable and that further NATO air strikes would 
be useless. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry's comments came as Serbian gunmen continued to shell and burn their way 
across the 32-square-mile "safe area" of Bihac, prompting beleaguered U.N. 
peacekeeping troops to begin moves toward withdrawal from Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent bombing raids by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization against the 
determined rebels and a succession of U.N. Security Council orders for an end 
to attacks on the U.N.-protected area have failed to halt or even slow the 
Serbian thrust against Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 Signaling a sea change in the Clinton Administration's previous support for 
the Muslim-led Bosnian government, Perry said he sees "no prospect" of its 
recovering the 70% of Bosnian territory lost to the Serbian nationalists during 
their 32-month-old rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Serbs have demonstrated military superiority on the ground," Perry said 
on NBC's "Meet the Press," conceding that the rebels could overrun the city of 
Bihac whenever they want. 
</P>
<P>
 "Air strikes cannot determine the outcome of the ground combat," the defense 
secretary said. "They can punish the Serbs, but they cannot determine the 
outcome of the ground combat." 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations has generally declined to ask for air strikes by NATO 
planes for fear that the Serbs would seek revenge against the 23,000 U.N. 
peacekeeping troops in Bosnia. Perry said he too opposes more strikes because 
that "would . . . drive the . . . U.N. forces out of Bosnia; it would lead to a 
widening of the war; it would lead to more violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said it would take "several hundred thousand troops with heavy weapons . 
. . involving significant casualties" to reverse the course of the fighting and 
defeat the Serbian rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the 2,000 Marines headed toward the Adriatic Sea coast are being 
positioned only for possible help in rescuing U.N. forces or downed NATO pilots 
and would not set foot on Balkan soil as peacekeeping troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, also appearing on "Meet the 
Press," denounced the U.N. Protection Force in Bosnia as a "classic failure" 
and called for the peacekeeping mission's withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be time to get the United Nations Protection Force out of there," Dole 
said. "They're not doing their job, and they're in harm's way. . . . Let's get 
them out of the way. Let's lift the arms embargo (on Bosnia). And let's at 
least let the Bosnians defend themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 He said U.N. resolutions creating safe havens in the war-torn country have 
become meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who cares what the U.N. does?" Dole asked. Saying the new Republican majority 
in Congress would take a "hard look" at U.S. financial support for the United 
Nations, he added, "The President is going to have to stop relying on the 
United Nations and start looking at whether we are going to be a part of NATO." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at U.N. mission headquarters in Zagreb, Croatia, said a 
"reconfiguration" of troops is already under way to concentrate them in 
better-defended compounds for potential evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have been asked to gather at military and command posts, to facilitate 
safety in the first place," said mission spokesman Michael Williams, adding 
that the consolidation could also be "preliminary" to evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
 There were also indications that some U.N. troops in vulnerable areas of 
Bosnia are trying to withdraw or reduce their numbers but are being taken 
hostage by Serbian gunmen as they move through rebel territory. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. sources in Zagreb said one convoy carrying 43 British soldiers out of 
Gorazde was taken hostage by Serbian gunmen once it left that U.N.-protected 
zone and that another convoy trying to carry British military engineers into 
the rebel-encircled pocket was blocked before it could enter. 
</P>
<P>
 One U.N. official conceded that the group trying to get into Gorazde may have 
been carrying arms and protective gear that British and Ukrainian peacekeepers 
in the embattled town would need to survive a retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 Those detentions and the disappearance of other U.N. troops headed into or out 
of besieged eastern Bosnian enclaves illustrated what mission officials fear is 
a rapidly escalating campaign of harassment by the confident Serbian rebels 
designed to drive away what little protection the United Nations affords those 
civilians still loyal to the Bosnian government. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 400 U.N. peacekeepers are now missing or held hostage by Bosnian 
Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. sources also disclosed a brutal and humiliating attack on British 
soldiers near Gorazde, some of whom were handcuffed by gloating Serbian gunmen 
and beaten with rifle butts. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. commander for Bosnia, British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, told reporters 
in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo that his forces might have to withdraw soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the thing gets much worse at the military level, then I suspect that the 
peacekeeping mission would find it very difficult to continue," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
 The acceleration of Serbian rebel aggression and Perry's comments Sunday 
created an atmosphere of defeat and impending doom at U.N. mission headquarters 
in Zagreb. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, Mr. Perry has now set policy," one U.N. official said of the 
defense secretary's statement that further use of air power to protect Bihac is 
pointless. "Everybody is breathing sighs of relief now that they don't have to 
get involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Rose succeeded in winning Bosnian government support for a cease-fire and 
demilitarization of the Bihac safe area, but there was no immediate indication 
that the advancing Serbs are prepared to stop their unfettered onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs have previously said that their compliance with a cease-fire in 
Bihac would be contingent on the government forces halting all offensive 
actions throughout Bosnia, which would amount to the Sarajevo government's 
capitulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Joseph, a U.N. official reached by telephone in Bihac, said it is clear 
to everyone in the embattled region that the Serbian gunmen are intent on 
"completely neutralizing" the Bosnian government army there. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are exceedingly close, virtually in the town," Joseph said of the Serbs 
advancing from both Bosnia and Croatia. "There really shouldn't be any 
impression that the crisis and the threats to the town have been abated." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph described the nearly 70,000 people crowded into the designated safe 
area, as well as the 100,000 or so living elsewhere in the violence-racked 
Bihac pocket, as "desperate." But he said few are fleeing the Serbian advance 
for lack of any more secure area to run to. 
</P>
<P>
 "How could they go somewhere else which did not even have the paper status of 
a safe area?" he asked. "They know they're not protected. They're prepared to 
die." 
</P>
<P>
 In his comments Sunday, Perry tried to absolve the Administration of blame for 
failing to stop the fighting. He said that the United States had successfully 
defended its own national interests in the Bosnian conflict. "Our national 
interests are to stop the spread of war and to limit the violence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the war spread outside Bosnia to other of the former Yugoslav republics, 
Perry said, "we would consider more substantial actions than we've taken now." 
The United States now has a few peacekeepers in Macedonia in a U.N. mission 
that is regarded as a form of "preventive diplomacy." In addition, U.S. 
officials have long warned Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic against armed 
repression of the majority Albanian people in the Serbian province of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry, however, refused to say how far the war would have to spread before the 
Clinton Administration would feel that U.S. national interests were endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to draw a line in the sand, and we're not going to state 
precisely what hypothetical situations would cause it," Perry said, "but it is 
very clear that stopping the spreading of the war is the major national 
interest that the United States has today." 
</P>
<P>
 Some U.N. officials in Zagreb speculated that with the greater accomplishment 
of scaring off U.S. support for the government and further punitive air 
strikes, the Serbian nationalists might accept the demilitarization of Bihac 
and turn their sights toward a settlement acknowledging the government's 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 One official in Zagreb predicted that the five-nation Contact Group, whose 
earlier plan for dividing Bosnia between the Serbs and the government was 
spurned by the rebels, would produce a revised offer this week that is more to 
the nationalists' liking. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiators of the Contact Group, which consists of the United States, Russia, 
Britain, France and Germany, are to meet Friday to consider how to respond to 
the latest developments in the conflict.

ANAHEIM DREAMS AS IT ASSESSES PROSPECTS; DEVELOPMENT: A NUMBER OF AMBITIOUS 
PROJECTS COULD BOLSTER THE CITY'S STANDING AS A TOURISM AND SPORTS CENTER. 
INVESTMENT, ESPECIALLY BY DISNEY, IS SEEN AS CRUCIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The time has come for dreams to become decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Disneyland, the Convention Center and Anaheim Stadium transformed the 
city's image a generation ago, Anaheim's destiny may forever be shaped over the 
next few months by an assortment of crucial decisions and fanciful projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the Walt Disney Co. build its massive resort? Will the Los Angeles Rams 
skip town? And the most important question: How can the city maintain its 
coveted reputation as a tourism and professional sports mecca? "This is 
definitely a key time for the city," Assistant City Manager Dave Morgan said. 
"These types of decisions probably only come around every 30 years or so and 
can change the direction of a city for generations." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever Disney and the Rams decide, it's clear the city won't be passive 
about its future. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are studying whether to build a lavish sports complex that 
would convert the Big A to a football-only stadium, include a new ballpark for 
the Angels, add restaurants, stores and a virtual-reality entertainment center 
and connect them around a park-like setting of canals and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials aren't entirely sure how they would make the ideas work, or even if 
they're feasible. But to Anaheim's dreamers, the plans are anything but 
far-fetched. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything we accomplished in the past could have been looked at as pie in 
the sky, and look at what's happened," said Irv Pickler, a just-departed city 
councilman. "Anaheim hasn't scratched the surface yet. . . . There are so many 
things we can do in this city." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you're going to see some dramatic changes in Anaheim in the next 60 
to 90 days," said Bob D. Simpson, whose term as councilman also ended this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other options the city is considering: 
</P>
<P>
 * Handing over the management and operations of its 27-year-old Convention 
Center to a private operator and giving the dome-shaped landmark a massive 
renovation and enlargement before the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 * Creating a sports authority to oversee the Pond and the two stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
 * Linking the Disneyland area to the proposed sports complex by a light-rail 
or monorail system. 
</P>
<P>
 The city already has set into motion a $172-million urban face lift of the 
area surrounding Disneyland, which will include lush landscaping, wider 
streets, underground utility lines and uniform signage. Now, city officials say 
they are focusing on the property around Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal, they say, is to convert that area from floundering office buildings 
to a thriving sports and entertainment playground that will be directly linked 
to Disneyland and the city's profitable convention center market. City 
officials say that their plans are extremely preliminary and conceptual. More 
important, city planners have not figured out how to pay for such daunting 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 But investment from the private sector, especially Disney, would seem to be 
key to success. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hope that Disney executives will not only move forward on the 
$3-billion Disneyland expansion, but also will see the potential financial 
opportunities if they became partners with the city in the sports complex 
concept. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney Chairman Michael D. Eisner said he expects to make a decision 
"very soon" on the expansion plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But some are growing frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Elfend, a City Hall lobbyist who represents hotel developers in the 
Disneyland area, said "there is a growing sense in the community that something 
has to happen, thumbs up or thumbs down" on the Disney project. Hotel 
developers are waiting with plans to expand if Disney does, but are tired of 
waiting -- upward of two years now -- for a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials certainly haven't given up on Disney, or on its connection to 
the stadium area. They envision an Anaheim where tourists check into local 
hotels for days, visit Disneyland, attend a Mighty Ducks hockey game one night 
and Rams football game the next, filling time in between by shopping in local 
stores and dining in local restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an exciting idea," said Jeff Farano, president of the Anaheim Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a scenario may not be all that far-fetched for Disney, which has 
Disneyland and the Mighty Ducks to anchor the ends of the ambitious project. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials say that the Ducks have exceeded expectations, both 
financially and in their performance on the ice, and that the company is 
interested in pursuing new team sports. The officials say they haven't closed 
the door on participating in the sports complex development, which could also 
include hotels and a restaurant row. 
</P>
<P>
 If Disney doesn't get involved in the sports complex, some city officials say 
privately that the opportunities could then be offered to a Disney competitor, 
such as Universal Studios or MGM. 
</P>
<P>
 But even before city officials line up developers and partners for the sports 
complex, they have to make sure there will be professional teams to fill the 
stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, they are struggling to put together a deal to prevent the Rams from 
fleeing the city. Part of that deal involves remodeling Anaheim Stadium for 
football only. 
</P>
<P>
 Most city officials expect the team to make a decision by the end of the year, 
but even if the Rams leave, city officials believe they could attract another 
National Football League franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the city is in the middle of negotiations with the California 
Angels to extend the team's lease and build the team a new baseball-only 
stadium, probably in the parking lot of the current stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have said stadium projects could be financed with the help of 
redevelopment funds, which were made possible after the stadium area was 
declared a redevelopment district because of damage sustained during the 
Northridge earthquake. The city is also apparently considering other financing 
methods, such as a surcharge on sporting event tickets.

THE WRITE STUFF; PROFESSOR DISPENSES ADVICE ON ENGLISH USAGE OVER A HOT LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Millions of people out there carry the private shame of the grammatically 
challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-shrifted by their public schools, or simply baffled by their mother 
tongue, they suffer the torment and sometimes public embarrassment of poor 
spelling, bad grammar and awful punctuation. 
</P>
<P>
 But in those moments of deepest despair -- when they are stumped trying to get 
pronouns to agree with antecedents, or trying to divine the difference between 
'affect' and 'effect' -- one Michael Strumpf and his Grammar Hotline are there 
to help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hello, Syracuse," Strumpf says into the phone after the caller identifies 
herself as Mary, a former school teacher in that city. "No, no, it's nothing to 
be embarrassed about. Go ahead and read me the sentence." 
</P>
<P>
 And so it goes. Strumpf sets the woman straight, bids her farewell and goes on 
to his regular work -- grading English papers at Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
 Piled high on his desk are essays from about 100 students assigned to his 
three introductory writing classes. Each student will write seven essays over 
the semester, and Strumpf will go over the essays one-on-one with each student. 
The workload grows even greater as he demands that the papers be rewritten when 
they don't measure up. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to explain every comma," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the hundreds of essays he grades every semester. Strumpf, 60, 
answers about 300 calls a week from all over the country on the 20-year-old hot 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 After a recent news article circulated nationwide about his service, calls 
poured in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unbelievable! We've had 317 calls today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an epidemic of calls -- Monitor Radio, the Canadian Broadcast System, 
CBS Radio, KNX, the Boston Herald," he said. "And you know the one question 
they all asked me: 'How much do you get paid?' They can't believe anyone would 
do this for free. But that's the reason we're alive, right? To help other 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just about helping other people, though. Strumpf, a self-styled guru 
of grammar, is on a mission to rid the nation of sentences slovenly strewn 
together with a careless disregard for proper English. 
</P>
<P>
 He sees this as a national issue. He dreams of a "Literacy Corps" -- an 
organization modeled after the Peace Corps, in which volunteers would answer 
questions of grammar and punctuation for any American who cared to inquire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't get me wrong," he said. "America is the greatest country in the world. 
But I travel to other countries, and people there are speaking and writing 
properly. Why can't we?" 
</P>
<P>
 For Strumpf, bad grammar is just another symptom of the societal decay that he 
sees demonstrated by increased crime, drug use, political corruption and the 
decline of the American family. 
</P>
<P>
 Strumpf faults the public school system for graduating students who lack basic 
skills in their own language. And he has some radical ideas of how to reform 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get rid of the boards of education, all the administrators and the fat that 
doesn't have anything to do with teaching kids," he said, beginning a short 
list of quick fixes for the country's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Start testing teachers; make sure they are professionals," he said. "Get rid 
of tenure; bad teachers hide behind it and good teachers don't need it. Start 
paying classroom teachers more; they should be the second most important focus, 
next to students." 
</P>
<P>
 Strumpf himself ended his quest for a doctorate in English at USC just one 
year short of the degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ph.D. stands for 'Piled Higher and Deeper,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A teacher for the past 38 years, Strumpf supplements his college work with 
tutoring and consulting for corporations. He has also worked as an expert 
witness in legal cases that hinge on the grammatical interpretation of 
contracts. He swears he was an expert witness on a case that hinged on the 
implication of a single semicolon. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also managed to write several non-fiction books and is working on two 
novels and a play. He said he developed his devotion to language growing up in 
New York City, learning Greek and Latin at school and the art of conversation 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
 His love for words and how they are used can lead to tough criticism for those 
who misuse them. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently fired off a harsh missive to the Moorpark College newspaper, for 
example, after he found a news page rife with errors. Showing the offending 
page, he pointed out a misspelling in a headline and the misuse of the word 
"due." 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't spell 'do,' " he said in disbelief. "This is college we're talking 
about here." 
</P>
<P>
 Strumpf does not fault the students. For him, the mistakes are another example 
of a failed educational system. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can't teach these kids properly in 12 years, something is terribly 
wrong," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On other fronts, he said, our language is constantly being ravaged by pop 
culture. He singles out sports stars in particular, shaking his head when he 
mentions the damage that he says they have wreaked upon the English language. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants professional sports teams to require their players to attend a 
weekend seminar on proper grammar. 
</P>
<P>
 "A weekend would be enough," he said. "Just give me a weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 More and more students coming into his classes struggle with simple English 
expression, a problem his school shares with major universities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Students) are not dumber today. But they've taken more punches to the head, 
and they're having a hard time standing up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not all the schools' fault, Strumpf said. 
</P>
<P>
 So Strumpf does what he can. He has the hot line that takes calls Monday 
through Friday from 8 a.m. until 1 p.m. And every Monday night he hosts a 
meeting at a local restaurant for any student struggling with grammar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want them to know I'm on their side," he said, "but there are rules." 
</P>
<P>
 He starts each of his college classes by shaking hands with all his students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We then have a sort of contract to get down to work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When he addresses students, he will preface their names with "Great," as in 
"Great Mary, do you have a question?" And he likes to refer to his students as 
"scholars in training." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he is no pushover. He drops students who miss more than five classes 
and regularly gives out D's and F's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students need to know there is a right and wrong," he said. "They don't mind 
being told they've done something wrong. They just need reasons. That's why 
people call the hot line; they don't just want answers, they want to know why." 
</P>
<P>
 The people who call range from executives and journalists to parents and 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Strumpf's message for those trying to remember lessons from English classes 
long ago is simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can help," he says. "All you have to do is call."

LEGISLATURE LEAPS INTO LAPTOP COMPUTER AGE; CAPITOL: WITH SUCH A DEVICE AT EACH 
DESK IN CHAMBERS, LAWMAKERS WILL HAVE VOLUMES OF DATA AT THEIR FINGERTIPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Senate, where tradition retreats only grudgingly, is about to 
surrender to that trendy symbol of the Cyber Age, the laptop computer. 
</P>
<P>
 New laptops known as "think pads" are expected to greet the members when the 
senior chamber of the Legislature convenes Dec. 5 to organize its 1995 
legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to modernize," said first-term Senate leader Bill Lockyer 
(D-Hayward), a self-described computer nerd who has gently phased in a series 
of efficiency reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 The laptops are designed to enable members to accomplish at their Gold 
Rush-era, hand-carved desks virtually everything they could do during the Paper 
Age, except vote. Lockyer said that as the transition occurs over the next few 
months, written bills, amendments and other printed documents gradually will be 
abolished. 
</P>
<P>
 With a simple tap on the screen, senators will be able to call up the text of 
a bill, an analysis of its contents, its history, previous votes and 
amendments. The same volume of information now consumes tons of paper and many 
dollars in printing costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the information will be in the computer," Lockyer said. He expects 
members to embrace the change. 
</P>
<P>
 The senators will have to attend a computer class for operating instructions, 
but the break-in period is expected to go smoothly. "We tried to come up with 
something that is idiot-proof," said a legislative technician. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Senate and the Assembly have maintained computerized information 
systems for several years. But arrival of the laptops will, for the first time, 
put computers in the hands of decision-makers during critical floor sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly also plans to shift from paper to member-operated laptop 
computers Dec. 5, but the change there is viewed more as a logical evolution 
than a revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, the 80-member Assembly has used an electronic tote board to 
instantly record votes cast from push buttons at members' desks. Assembly 
members also have had access to high-tech kiosks in the chamber to check on the 
status of a pending bill or a roll-call vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, change is slower in the Senate. Tradition dictates, for example, 
that men, including visitors, must wear a coat and tie during floor sessions -- 
even during Sacramento's scorching summers. The Assembly abolished the dress 
code years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, members of the Senate formally address one another with the 
honorific title "senator." In the laid-back Assembly, first names are commonly 
used, even during the angriest of debates. 
</P>
<P>
 However antiquated, one Senate tradition is not soon to be tampered with: the 
time-consuming vote by voice roll call, in which all 40 senators' names are 
read aloud, whether or not the member is present. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer and fellow computer enthusiast Sen. Bill Leonard of Big Bear, chairman 
of the Republican caucus, agree that while calling the roll may be a tedious 
and inefficient throwback to low tech, it is important to preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 They say verbal roll calls provide for a mature decorum not found in the 
Assembly, where members commonly violate the rules by "ghost voting" for their 
friends or race en masse to their desks in order to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the abuses in the Assembly," recalls Leonard, a former assemblyman. "In 
the Senate, I don't have to dive over to my desk to vote. In the Assembly, it 
is like constantly running through the airport and dodging people to push the 
button." 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer said the methodical, name-by-name roll calls in the Senate give 
members time to analyze how their colleagues are voting and make their own 
tactical decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a purpose to a tradition that makes current sense, there is no 
reason to change it just because there is an electronic gizmo at hand," Lockyer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Total cost of the laptop project, including wiring the chamber and software 
purchases, is estimated at about $1.5 million, according to Cliff Berg and Bob 
Connelly, chief staff officers of the Senate and Assembly rules committees 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 They said each laptop, purchased from IBM for the Senate and from NEC for the 
Assembly, cost about $7,000. They acknowledged that the price appears high but 
said the equipment will contain a huge memory and other "high-end" 
special-order features that will make them compatible with the Legislature's 
existing computer system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we would have liked to buy (a discount-store) model for $999," 
Berg said. "But to handle the Legislature's current computer system, you have 
to have a very high memory capacity."

2 CHURCHES FEUD OVER ADVERTISING; RELIGION: AMERICAN CATHOLIC BRANCH ATTRACTS 
PEOPLE WHO WISH TO REMARRY, BUT ROMAN CATHOLIC DIOCESE SAYS IT IS MISLEADING 
PEOPLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The local newspaper advertisements aim at divorced Roman Catholics who, 
because they were once married, are barred from remarrying in their church. 
</P>
<P>
 "Want a Catholic Wedding but Cannot Be Married in Your Roman Catholic Parish? 
Call the Priests of Saint Matthew Church. An American Catholic Community." 
</P>
<P>
 Such marketing has lured a booming wedding business to St. Matthew, a tiny 
church in Orange where priests say they officiate at about 300 marriages a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But St. Matthew's advertising, which targets "unhappy or disenfranchised Roman 
Catholics," its founding pastor says, has spurred an ongoing feud with the 
Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Msgr. Lawrence J. Baird, the diocese spokesman, contends that the priests at 
St. Matthew are trying to deceive Roman Catholics that theirs is a Roman 
Catholic church when it is not. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Matthew's designation as a Catholic Church, albeit American rather than 
Roman Catholic, in itself is confusing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clear that St. Matthew is being disingenuous in regard to appealing to 
Roman Catholics," Baird said. "The issue is deceptive advertising." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of complaints from some Roman Catholics who were misled, Baird said, 
the official diocesan newsletter last year ran a warning that marriage 
attempted before priests or deacons of St. Matthew would be invalid in the eyes 
of the Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Baird said that at the urging of the diocese, most Roman Catholic parishes in 
Orange County over the last 12 months have placed similar alerts in the 
bulletins they distribute at Sunday Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 The diocese has angered Father Peter E. Hickman, founder of St. Matthew, who 
said the accusations falsely impugn the reputation of his church. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a campaign to discredit St. Matthew," he complained. It worries 
him, he said, because "the Roman Catholic Church is a moral force that carries 
a big punch." 
</P>
<P>
 Hickman said he was insulted by a letter that a Roman Catholic priest in 
Riverside sent to the parents of a prospective bride in September, alleging 
that those running St. Matthew were "posing" as Roman Catholic priests. The 
Riverside priest refused to forward the bride's baptismal certificate to St. 
Matthew in preparation for the marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickman, whose 400-member congregation meets in a converted office building 
close to the Orange Freeway, said he is eager for the church to grow. He 
attributed his missionary zeal in part to his training as a Southern Baptist 
minister before his conversion to Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
 He is recruiting Roman Catholics who, because of divorce and remarriage or the 
practice of artificial birth control, are no longer welcome to receive the 
sacraments in the church of their youth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickman said his congregation consists largely of baby boomers between 30 and 
50 for whom St. Matthew's Mass and sacraments offer comfortable familiarity. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Troianello, 44, of north Tustin said she had been brought up Catholic 
but after finishing parochial school and leaving home, went to church only when 
her mother visited her. 
</P>
<P>
 She sought Hickman six years ago when she wanted to marry a divorced man. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really for my mother so she wouldn't be disappointed," Troianello 
said. The couple also decided it would be "beyond hypocrisy" to apply to the 
Roman Catholic church to have his former marriage annulled, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Troianellos said Father Peter, as his parishioners call him, never 
claimed that St. Matthew was Roman Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickman said he tells newcomers that St. Matthew is part of the Old Catholic 
Movement, which broke off from Roman Catholicism more than a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A brochure describing St. Matthew says that unlike a Roman Catholic church, it 
does not accept the teaching of papal infallibility. Among other differences, 
its priests may marry, divorced parishioners may remarry without having their 
former marriages annulled, and the use of artificial contraception is 
permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 But Old Catholicism's similarity to Roman Catholicism also makes it attractive 
to fallen-away Roman Catholics, Hickman said. Most important, he said, the 
ordination of Old Catholic priests, like the ordination of Roman Catholic 
priests, can be traced in unbroken succession to the Apostles. Moreover, he 
said, some Old Catholic priests, including two at St. Matthew, were ordained in 
the Roman Catholic Church but left to marry. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Gregory Coiro, director of public affairs for the Roman Catholic 
Archdiocese of Los Angeles, acknowledged that because the "apostolic 
succession" has been preserved in some Old Catholic churches, the Roman 
Catholic religion would consider their sacraments, such as Holy Communion and 
penance, to be valid in those churches. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added that it would be sinful for a Roman Catholic to knowingly attend 
a church separated from Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Coiro said Roman Catholics may receive sacraments from an Old Catholic priest 
only in an emergency, such as a last confession when no Roman Catholic priest 
is available. 
</P>
<P>
 Msgr. Daniel Brennan, judicial vicar at the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange, 
added that special church laws governing marriage stipulate that no clergy but 
the priests of the couple's parish may perform a marriage for Roman Catholics 
unless the bishop approves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Roman Catholic Church seeks to tightly control the lives of its members," 
Hickman said. "By providing an alternative, we are undermining their control." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Callahan, a bishop in the Old Catholic Church who oversees St. 
Matthew, said he believes an "economic issue" lies at the heart of the diocesan 
warnings: concern about the prospect of losing income that churches obtain from 
marriages and other sacraments. 
</P>
<P>
 Callahan said there are about 20 churches in Southern California with Old 
Catholic roots, of which St. Matthew is one of the largest and most active. He 
said less active churches with Catholic in their name have avoided the 
attention of the Roman Catholic hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 One such church, St. Francis-By-The-Sea American Catholic Church, has operated 
quietly in Laguna Beach since 1933. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not heard anything from the Diocese of Orange," said Bishop Simon 
Eugene Talarczyk. He said the church has done very little advertising and 
performs weddings "by way of referral." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles said they became 
aware of another church in the Old Catholic tradition, St. Augustine Old Roman 
Catholic Church in East Los Angeles, after news last summer about a scandal 
involving a priest there. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda Anaya-Eckdahl, a spokeswoman for the archdiocese, said that when 
stories about the priest's conviction for child molestation stated he was not 
Roman Catholic, the archdiocese was flooded with calls from St. Augustine 
parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
 She said St. Augustine "had been appealing to newly arrived immigrants, and 
they thought they were receiving sacraments from the Roman Catholic Church." 
The pastor of St. Augustine, however, contends he tells all his members that 
the church "is not under the jurisdiction of the Pope." 
</P>
<P>
 Baird, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange spokesman, said his church is 
simply trying to prevent its own members from being misguided, to exert a form 
of "quality control." 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested that in Orange County, St. Matthew should reach out to the 
"unchurched" people and leave Roman Catholics alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very concerned about lapsed Catholics, and both priests and lay people 
in the parishes have really been trying to do whatever they can to bring people 
back," he said. "There are heroic people living happy lives as Roman Catholics, 
and we don't need St. Matthew to assist with the evangelization of those born 
Roman Catholic."

SPILL LENDS A BARNYARD FLAVOR TO RUSSIAN CITY; POLLUTION: FARM DUMPS THOUSANDS 
OF TONS OF COW MANURE INTO RIVER SUPPLYING MOST OF DRINKING WATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Anatoly Olosov woke up, washed his hands, sat down to breakfast and began to 
wonder where that awful stench was coming from. 
</P>
<P>
 "I smelled and tasted the food, and it was normal," said Olosov, a 60-year-old 
pensioner. "Then I smelled my hands. And I thought, 'Thank God I didn't brush 
my teeth.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Vladimir, a 12th-Century town that is a favorite site for pilgrims 
and tourists, has suffered an ecological accident of a most embarrassing kind: 
a massive spill of cow manure into the Nerl River, which supplies most of 
Vladimir with its drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
 A collective cattle farm upstream from Vladimir, unable to dispose of its 
manure, dumped about 120,000 tons of manure and water directly into the Nerl 
early last week, said Galina D. Minayeva, chief of the water resources 
department of the Vladimir Region Ecology Committee. Estimates vary as to how 
much manure was spilled, and some officials say they'll never know the exact 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a day, the smell of the tap water was unspeakable. The city declared a 
state of emergency and organized convoys of milk and beer trucks to deliver 
clean water to kindergartens, schools and hospitals, said Deputy Mayor Vladimir 
P. Brashnikov. 
</P>
<P>
 By Saturday, the smell had mostly abated, but hundreds of city residents were 
still standing in line for up to five hours in a bitter cold to draw clean 
water from a city well. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ridge above them, the golden onion domes of Vladimir's ancient 
cathedrals seemed to glow warmly in the icy mist. But the miserable people in 
line below were more preoccupied with their frozen feet. Old women and children 
trudged away lugging their heavy haul of clean water. Others strapped their 
bottles to luggage carts or dragged them home on children's sleds. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said Saturday that Nerl water, though foul smelling, is safe to 
drink. But the angry citizens in line for well water were not convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came home, opened the tap in the kitchen, and immediately the whole place 
started to smell like a pigsty," said Russian army Lt. Col. Vasily Donskov, 37, 
who had been in the water line for three hours and was still far from the 
wellhead. "We heard on the radio the instructions to boil the tap water. So we 
boiled it, and it stank even more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't trust the authorities any longer," Donskov said. "I'd rather 
spend four hours or more here in the cold than have my kids drink that filth 
and be poisoned." 
</P>
<P>
 Russians are painfully experienced in ecological calamity, from the 1986 
Chernobyl nuclear accident to this autumn's huge oil spill in the Arctic region 
of Komi. Even so, a massive manure spill is a novelty, and some Vladimir 
residents managed to laugh about it -- through clenched teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 The spill is not nearly as ecologically harmful as a chemical disaster would 
have been, and it did not kill many fish in the partly frozen Nerl, ecologist 
Minayeva said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it will worsen the already poor water quality in the Nerl and in the 
Klyazma River, which is fed by the Nerl and also supplies drinking water to the 
370,000 residents of Vladimir, about 100 miles east of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Klyazma runs through the Moscow region, which is one of the most 
industrial in Russia, before it comes here," Minayeva said. "It runs past 13 
sewage outlets before coming to our water-collection point." 
</P>
<P>
 The Petrovsky collective farm and a nearby vodka factory have been polluting 
the Nerl with impunity for years, she said, and even before last week's manure 
spill a third of all the water samples taken in Vladimir did not meet state 
water standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The condition of the Nerl River is becoming worse and worse every year," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A plan to switch to underground water supplies was approved by the Soviet 
Council of Ministers in 1969, and construction on a pumping station began in 
1983, but the project is still nowhere near completion, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Vladimir prosecutor general has opened a criminal investigation 
of last week's spill. It is still not clear whether the manure was dumped in 
the river out of stupidity or desperation, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail of the spill leads 63 miles up the Nerl River to the tiny village of 
Morozovo, where the Petrovsky collective farm has about 10,000 head of cattle 
and swine. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignoring complaints from the villagers, the farm has for years been dumping 
manure into a huge pond on the bank of the river that was originally built to 
hold fresh water. Only a simple floodgate separates the pond from the river, 
and villagers said anyone could have opened it easily. 
</P>
<P>
 The people of Morozovo have been protesting the manure dumping for years, but 
to no avail. In summertime the stench is unbearable, and whenever the level of 
the pond rises, the water in Morozovo's drinking wells begins to smell foul, 
said Lyudmilla I. Savelyeva, 42, the leader of the village of 400 families. 
</P>
<P>
 Vladimir officials said they had been told that the cash-strapped Petrovsky 
farm simply could not afford the gasoline to run the trucks that should have 
removed the manure from the pond and spread it on the fields. 
</P>
<P>
 But Savelyeva charged that the collective farm had allowed the manure to build 
up even when cheap gasoline was available. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easier for them to dump it into the river than take it away," she said. 
"We can't understand why they keep doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Collective farm offices were closed Saturday, and officials could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Vladimir officials said the river water that supplies their city will improve 
within a few days. But Savelyeva said Morozovo's wells still smell, even after 
she dosed them with chlorine. She believes that the water poses a health hazard 
but said authorities have ignored her pleas for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have nowhere else to go to get clean water," she said.

UPDATE; VIOLENT IMAGE STILL A DARK CLOUD OVER FLORIDA TOURISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CLARY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of course, the tourism delegation Miami dispatched to London and Frankfurt, 
Germany, earlier this month talked up the $5.6 billion being spent to renovate 
hotels, replenish the beaches and improve the highways here. And the group 
passed out plenty of brochures featuring palm trees, tropical drinks and fun in 
the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps most important -- and most unusual -- in the delegation's pitch to 
European travel writers and tour operators was the presence of John S. Farrell, 
who is one of greater Miami's top cops. His job: Assure prospective British and 
German visitors that a vacation in Florida need not be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't leave your common sense at home," advised Farrell, who then cited 
statistics showing robberies of tourists down by 56% this year compared with 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime and safety are the No. 1 issue," said Mayco Villafana of the Greater 
Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau. "We need to put it behind us, and I think 
we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, tourism officials throughout Florida agree that the outlook 
remains gloomy. Florida's $32-billion tourism industry is still reeling from a 
series of highly publicized assaults on foreign visitors, including the murder 
of Briton Gary Colley in September, 1993. The number of visitors from Germany 
and Britain plunged by as much as 50% last winter, and this year Florida 
tourism in general is flat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business is extremely soft, and it's going to continue," said Bill Sims, who 
runs several central Florida theme parks and chairs the state Tourist 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 While crime and a weakened European economy are cited as the major reasons for 
the drop in Florida visitors, many feel that tourists also are forsaking 
Florida for fresher attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Florida hoteliers and others in the tourism industry backed casino 
gambling as a way out of the doldrums. But despite a $16-million advertising 
campaign, 60% of state voters on Nov. 8 rejected a proposal to open 47 gaming 
parlors around the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The gambling issue did win the favor of southern Florida voters, and the 
Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau supported it as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gov. Lawton Chiles and his Administration opposed it. Florida Commerce 
Secretary Charles Dusseau called the ballot measure "an attempt at a hostile 
takeover of Florida's . . . tourism industry by outside gambling interests." 
</P>
<P>
 A third of the $1.6-million anti-casino effort came from Orlando's Walt Disney 
World, which reportedly has its own visitor problems. Attendance has declined 
by almost 5 million a year, to 28.9 million, from a peak four years ago, 
according to the Orlando Sentinel. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop-off at Disney World, by far the single most popular draw among 
Florida tourists, reflects the statewide trend. In 1993, a record 41 million 
tourists -- both domestic and foreign -- came to the Sunshine State. This 
year's total is expected to be half a million less. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, Florida unveiled a new ad campaign centered on the slogan "Return 
to your senses in Florida," which focuses on the restorative benefits of lying 
on the beach. But the $4.2-million cost of the campaign, consisting chiefly of 
TV spots in Northern markets, eats up almost two-thirds of the state's annual 
advertising budget of $6.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Florida is being outspent by other states, by Mexico, by countries in the 
Caribbean," said Gary Stogner of Florida's Division of Tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tourist Commission, an advisory board of people in the industry, has 
suggested a $40-million ad campaign to redefine and sharpen the state's image. 
</P>
<P>
 "Image is still a problem," Stogner admits. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. The day after the Miami tourism delegation left for home, for example, 
the London Sunday Telegraph published a story on the Floridians' visit that 
made reference to the murder of Colley. That shooting took place at a highway 
rest stop outside Tallahassee, which is 470 miles north of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 The headline on the article: "City of crime tries to woo back British."

RABBI KILLED, ISRAEL POLICEMAN HURT IN WEST BANK ATTACK BY GUNMEN; MIDEAST: A 
RADICAL ISLAMIC GROUP IS SUSPECTED IN THE AMBUSH ON MT. HEBRON. THE WOUNDED 
OFFICER WAS HITCHING A RIDE. 
</P>

<P>
 A rabbi was killed and an Israeli policeman wounded Sunday when two gunmen, 
believed to be members of a radical Islamic group, ambushed their car on Mt. 
Hebron in the occupied West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Amiram Olami, 36, head of a religious school in the small Israeli 
settlement of Otniel, south of Hebron, apparently was struck by several bullets 
when two gunmen opened fire with AK-47 assault rifles from the roadside, but 
military sources were uncertain whether Olami died from the shots or the 
subsequent crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Policeman Ehud Yitzhak, who had hitched a ride with Olami, returned the 
gunmen's fire. Grazed by two bullets in the ambush, Yitzhak was reported in 
good condition in Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 State-run Israel Radio reported that an anonymous telephone caller said the 
military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement, known as Hamas, carried out 
the ambush. "We will continue the attacks," the caller declared, speaking in 
Hebrew. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gen. Ehud Barak, the Israeli military chief of staff, warned the Cabinet 
during its regular Sunday meeting that further attacks -- increasingly 
sophisticated, deadly and difficult to prevent -- are likely from Hamas and 
other extremist groups opposed to Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-one people have been killed over the past two months in a series of 
such attacks by Muslim radicals, according to Israeli officials. There is now 
fear that extremists are preparing to repeat the deadly ambushes they carried 
out late last year, coinciding again with the Jewish festival of Hanukkah, 
which began at sunset Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the 120,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank blamed the attack on 
government plans to expand Palestinian self-government in the region and pull 
Israeli forces out of most Palestinian towns and villages in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a direct result of the prime minister's proposal for removing the 
army from city centers," the Council of Jewish Settlements in Judea, Samaria 
and Gaza said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, this is the hundredth victim since the accord was signed," 
council spokeswoman Yehudit Tayar added, referring to Israel's September, 1993, 
agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization on self-rule. "If this is 
what happens when the army is here, we can only nightmarishly imagine what 
would happen if they are not on the spot." 
</P>
<P>
 Other settlers said that the army had recently reduced its patrols in the 
area, apparently as part of the planned pullback, although two Israelis were 
killed about half a mile from there early this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are dangerous killers in this area," said Roni Shechner, head of the 
regional council of settlements in the Mt. Hebron area. "But the army is 
thinning its forces here, not reinforcing them." 
</P>
<P>
 The gunmen fired more than 30 bullets at Olami's car, military sources said, 
and the automobile flipped over as Olami lost control. His body was removed 
later from the crushed vehicle. A passing Palestinian motorist took the wounded 
policeman to a nearby Israeli settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli soldiers searched fields along the road after the attack, taking about 
10 Palestinians in for questioning.

JORDAN, ISRAEL SET DIPLOMATIC TIES, PLAN ENVOY EXCHANGE

 Jordan and Israel announced Sunday that they are establishing diplomatic ties, 
a month after the two countries signed a peace treaty ending a 46-year state of 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 A joint communique issued in Amman and Jerusalem paved the way for exchanging 
ambassadors and opening embassies in Amman and Tel Aviv by Dec. 10, as set out 
in the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan thus became the second Arab country to open diplomatic ties with the 
Jewish state after Egypt, which signed a treaty with Israel in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 A party of Jordanian schoolchildren were to go to Israel today to attend 
celebrations in Haifa, becoming the first group of Jordanians to formally enter 
Israel since Nov. 14, when both countries opened the way for visits, border 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Israeli tourists have flocked to Jordan in the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint statement said that both countries hope the move will promote 
comprehensive peace, development and cooperation. They will now formally 
exchange letters nominating ambassadors. 
</P>
<P>
 King Hussein personally chose Marwan Muasher, 38, Jordan's former Middle East 
peace team spokesman and an affluent U.S.-educated computer entrepreneur, as 
Jordan's first envoy to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan's Cabinet appointed Muasher, a Christian non-career diplomat, as 
ambassador and is expected to send his papers to Israel soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel has yet to name an envoy to Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 A Jordanian delegation from the Foreign Ministry will visit Israel Thursday to 
choose a site for the embassy and homes for diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the short time until Dec. 10, Jordanian officials have not ruled out the 
possibility that the two sides might rent hotel suites in Amman and Tel Aviv as 
temporary embassies and staff housing, creating security headaches in both 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Each mission will have at least four diplomats and more than 10 locally hired 
staff members.

 London said it will open direct talks with Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican 
Army's political wing, this year as planned, despite delays to Northern 
Ireland's peace process. The fall of Ireland's government two weeks ago has 
upset the timetable for the fragile peace process and left Britain, less eager 
than Ireland to move ahead, in charge. But Michael Ancram, junior minister 
responsible for the province, said talks with Sinn Fein and Protestant 
paramilitary groups will start by the end of the year.

EX-POW GETS SOUVENIR BRICKS AT 'HANOI HILTON' DEMOLITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Workmen on Sunday knocked through a wall of a prison nicknamed the Hanoi 
Hilton by U.S. servicemen held there during the Vietnam War. A luxury hotel is 
to be built on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 One former POW, retired Navy Capt. Cole Black, carried away a few souvenir 
bricks from the prison, a place of pilgrimage for returning veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 Black, 62, of Escondido, and his wife, Karen, along with other American 
tourists on a bus tour, peeked in the front gate at the intact cellblocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "They liked to put people in irons -- medieval-type punishment," Black 
recalled. "The treatment was very bad." 
</P>
<P>
 At the rear of the structure, workers with a backhoe and sledgehammers opened 
a hole big enough for trucks to enter. 
</P>
<P>
 The prison, whose real name is Hoa Lo, was built by the colonial French 
government and held Vietnamese nationalists and Communists during the 1940s and 
1950s. The first wife of Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, commander of the guerrilla forces 
that drove French forces out of Vietnam in 1954, died there in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 After the United States began sending troops to prop up non-Communist South 
Vietnam against the Communist North, the prison became notorious for holding 
American POWs, who coined the nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 The prison's last residents, young Vietnamese convicts, were transferred to 
another facility earlier this year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton Engineering of Singapore and the Hanoi Construction Co. plan a 22-story 
luxury hotel at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Vietnamese are eager to replace the city's wartime relics with the modern 
trappings of economic development. Hanoi authorities already have cleared the 
wreckage of a downed American B-52 bomber from Lenin Park to make way for 
another foreign hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Black was unsentimental about his visit to the prison where he was held on and 
off for seven years until being released in 1973 after the United States and 
North Vietnam made peace. He was shot down and taken prisoner about 60 miles 
northeast of Hanoi on June 21, 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 Black said the visit was mostly at the urging of his wife, who is writing a 
fictionalized account of his war experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no special feelings about it," he said. "I never really had a good look 
at it from outside. Any time I'd been taken in or out I'd been blindfolded."

HOPE RISES AMONG WEARY SRI LANKANS FOR CIVIL WAR'S END; ASIA: EVEN IN DISTRICT 
WHERE 57 WERE KILLED IN ATTACK BY SUSPECTED SUICIDE BOMBER, 'A GOOD TIME HAS 
COME.' CREDIT FOR OPTIMISM GOES TO NEW PRESIDENT.

<P>
 On the streets of Grandpass, the scruffy district where vendors hawk wriggling 
fish plucked from the Indian Ocean and boys square off in the hot sun for a 
pickup game of cricket, hope has come again. 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't been a frequent visitor of late. This is the working-class 
neighborhood of Colombo, after all, where a few weeks ago, as best the police 
can determine, a woman strapped explosives tightly to her body and detonated 
them at a nighttime political rally. She snuffed out 57 lives, blowing off her 
own head in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was then, and this, people in Grandpass tell you, is now. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good time has come," plump, white-haired Narayani Gopalan, 71 and missing 
her two front teeth, said one recent morning with total and simple conviction. 
"God has opened his eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Sri Lanka's educated, ruling elite use more complex explanations. 
But, in general, they concur: Their island, whose ancient name of Serendip was 
refashioned by a whimsical 18th-Century Englishman to denote the facility of 
stumbling across something wonderful by chance -- "serendipity" -- may be 
having a run of luck itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, reasons for caution remain, the politicians, observers and journalists 
note. But at no time over the past 11 years have hopes been so high that a 
peaceful end could be brought to one of the world's longest-running civil wars, 
the armed struggle by some of Sri Lanka's minority Tamils for a homeland of 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
 An obscure, exotic conflict for the rest of the world, the ethnic dispute has 
traumatized this lushly beautiful land that unfurls across the dark waters to 
the southeast of India like an emerald leaf. 
</P>
<P>
 The country's integrity has been broken, with the rebels of the Liberation 
Tigers of Tamil Eelam controlling tracts of the north and east. A quarter of 
revenue collected by the Colombo government is expended on fighting them, one 
minister says. The belligerents have battled to a stalemate, and the population 
as a whole appears to have had enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're now in a situation where the vast majority of the people in Sri Lanka 
-- Sinhalese, Tamil, Muslim -- are looking for peace," said Jayadeva Uyangoda, 
senior lecturer in political science at Colombo University. "It wasn't so a 
year ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Proof incarnate of this change, as well as one of the causes, is the ascension 
of a dark-eyed widow and single mother to the highest office in the land. 
Shattering a political taboo, Chandrika Kumaratunga declared that the use of 
force to suppress the insurgency has failed and that it is time to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
 To the astonishment of many, such frankness struck a chord with most Sri 
Lankans, including members of the Sinhalese majority, who have grown 
increasingly impatient to see an end to the bloodshed in which, by varying 
estimates, 30,000 to 50,000 people have died. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 9, just 1 1/2 years after Kumaratunga first stood as a candidate in a 
provincial election, her people made her the country's president by a historic 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
 The day she took office, she mixed what sounded like Kennedyesque New Frontier 
rhetoric with lyrics from the old Broadway musical "Man of La Mancha" to hold 
out the possibility of a brighter tomorrow. "Let us together climb those 
unreachable heights, let us realize that difficult but beautiful dream," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neelan Tiruchelvam, a lawyer and human rights activist who represents a 
moderate Tamil party in Parliament, observed of Kumaratunga, "She believes very 
much that this is her moment in history and that it needs to be grasped with 
firmness and resolution." 
</P>
<P>
 But such sunny optimism could vanish as quickly as the southwest monsoon blows 
in each May to blanket the sky with rain clouds, because the new president is 
dealing with an uncertain interlocutor. 
</P>
<P>
 She wants to end the war. The goals of the Tigers, who are led by a ruthless 
guerrilla and Clint Eastwood fan who just turned 40, are still a matter of 
speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio intercepts indicated that after Kumaratunga's election, Tiger leader 
Velupillai Prabhakaran ordered his units to observe a weeklong truce unless 
attacked. But he and his men have generally kept their opinion of the island's 
new leader to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is that the Tigers don't want peace," said Regi Siriwardena, a 
veteran Colombo journalist. "After all, they now have a de facto state. Why 
give it up?" 
</P>
<P>
 This modern-day parable of the lady and the Tigers is especially dangerous for 
the lady. If Kumaratunga doesn't make significant concessions, the Tigers will 
dismiss her promise of "peace and prosperity" as campaign rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 If she seems too conciliatory, or the Tigers give nothing in return, she risks 
a backlash among the Sri Lankan people and the army. 
</P>
<P>
 And if she can't deliver the improvement in the situation that people 
throughout the island are intensely hoping for, she will see public support 
melt away. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have large expectations, you have to fulfill them quickly or there 
will be a reverse movement fairly rapidly," said Ajith Samaranayake, editor of 
the state-run Observer and Sunday Observer newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 The bloody events of Oct. 24 in Grandpass underline the need for caution. The 
suicide bomber, a young woman in her mid-20s who most Sri Lankans believe was 
an agent of the Tigers, wiped out the main opposition candidate for president 
and other leaders of his United National Party. Significantly, this massacre 
came after, and not before, preliminary talks had begun between envoys sent by 
Kumaratunga, who was then prime minister, and the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came, they talked, and they killed," Uyangoda of Colombo University 
summed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Kumaratunga and her government avoided pinning the blame on the Tigers as the 
election approached. But if a police investigation finds that the rebels were 
responsible, or if more bombing and terrorist attacks occur, she will face 
mounting doubt and hostility among the Sinhalese, the predominantly Buddhist 
group to which she and nearly three-quarters of Sri Lanka's 17.2 million people 
belong. Some are already downright suspicious of her "peace process." 
</P>
<P>
 "Tamils have absolutely no right here as a separate entity or group," said 
Sinhalese hard-liner Harishchandra Wijayatunga, who ran in the presidential 
election as candidate of the nativist Sons of the Soil. "If any Indian wants to 
go home, fine. If he wants to stay, he has to be part and parcel of our 
culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Kumaratunga has held out the carrot of "extensive devolution" of power and the 
possible redrawing of provincial borders to tempt the Tamil rebels to lay down 
their arms and accept something less than Tamil eelam -- a Tamil nation. In 
light of her country's long history, those are weighty concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Federalism in Sri Lanka is a political four-letter word," Uyangoda said. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason, perhaps the main one, lies in the national mythology. Throughout 
the centuries, Buddhist monks doubling as historians portrayed Sri Lanka as the 
last bulwark of Buddhism against the rising tide of Hinduism. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Sinhalese were transplants from India themselves and the Tamils 
are believed to have begun arriving no later than the 3rd Century BC, or about 
the same time that Buddhism reached these shores, they went down in the 
chronicles, still used in classrooms today, as invaders and profaners. 
</P>
<P>
 British authorities further muddied the demographic picture of the tea-growing 
colony they called Ceylon by importing even more Tamils from India in the late 
19th Century to work the plantations in the central highlands. Today, Tamils 
make up about 18% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 Arabs, Malays, Muslims from India and Portuguese and Dutch colonists also 
arrived over the centuries and put down roots. The desires of the Muslims, 7% 
of the population, also must be part of Kumaratunga's calculations, because 
many of them live in the eastern lands where the Tigers operate. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many other ethnic protest movements, the Tigers actually hold territory 
that they have transformed into an economic and military power base. On the 
northern Jaffna peninsula, they effectively control administration, courts and 
taxation. They may be the only guerrilla force in the world to boast a navy. In 
their prisons, they hold an estimated 4,000 prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a guerrilla force in mountains somewhere," human rights activist 
Tiruchelvam said. "This is a de facto state." 
</P>
<P>
 Little wonder, then, that Kumaratunga's proposal of a more federalist Sri 
Lanka has elicited no ringing public endorsement from the Tigers' Prabhakaran 
and his subordinates. "They're already in power," said Siriwardena, the Colombo 
journalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, unlike the Irish Republican Army or the Palestine Liberation 
Organization, the Tigers have not yet made any dramatic gestures to open the 
door to peace. It is true that they might have, had talks about a cease-fire 
gone ahead as scheduled. Kumaratunga broke off those contacts within hours of 
the Grandpass explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Monday, Sri Lankan officials said Kumaratunga sent a message to the 
Tigers regarding a new date to resume peace talks. The guerrillas offered a new 
truce in exchange for an inquiry into the mutilation of one of their top 
intelligence agents, who was beheaded after being shot by security forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Government troops also went on red alert as the Tigers launched "Heroes' 
Week," the annual commemoration of their thousands of comrades in arms slain in 
the protracted battle for independence. 
</P>
<P>
 While the hesitation waltz toward the negotiating table continues, 
Kumaratunga's intention seems to be the winning of the hearts and minds of the 
civilian population. Her government has already softened an economic embargo of 
Jaffna to allow shipments of milk, food, gasoline, cement and other commodities 
to reach the Tigers' beleaguered haven. The electricity grid is being repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers scoff at the apparent naivete of attempting an end run around 
the Tigers. The joke has been that civilians in Jaffna are allowed by the 
tough, disciplined rebels to open their mouths for only two reasons: to brush 
their teeth or yawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Tamil people want peace. But they can't be allowed to have it by the 
Tigers," said Daham Wimalasena, an official in the United National Party. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the government and rebels held serious peace talks, ending in 
1991, the Tigers used the 14-month lull to rearm and regroup. When the peace 
talks collapsed, they went back to fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 The country's president, Ranasinghe Premadasa, was blown to bits on May Day of 
last year in a bombing much like the Grandpass attack. The Indian prime 
minister who dispatched a peacekeeping force here, Rajiv Gandhi, was also 
killed by a woman wearing a concealed explosive charge as he campaigned in 
1991. The Tigers are blamed for both assassinations, but deny responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Kumaratunga and her supporters are clearly betting that on the other side of 
the lines in Jaffna, there are many people who share their desire for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will take a long time," Tiruchelvam predicted. "But we believe that there 
is probably a new generation emerging in Sri Lanka who want to look at problems 
differently, who feel the previous government made mistakes and who -- dare I 
say? -- are more tolerant of diversity. They don't feel diversity is an 
impediment to nationhood, and I think Chandrika (Kumaratunga) symbolizes that 
new generation."

PROJECTIONS: SANGUINETTI TO LEAD URUGUAY; SOUTH AMERICA: THE FORMER PRESIDENT 
WINS CLOSE VOTE. ELECTION IS FIRST IN WHICH THIRD GROUP HAS SERIOUSLY 
CHALLENGED TWO TRADITIONAL PARTIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former President Julio Maria Sanguinetti won the presidential election in a 
close, three-way contest Sunday, according to projections based on incomplete 
official returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanguinetti, 58, and his traditional Colorado Party defeated the governing 
National, or Blanco (White), Party and the leftist Broad Front coalition, the 
polling firm Cifras declared. Its projections gave the Colorados 33.5% of the 
vote against 31% for the Blancos and 30% for the Broad Front and its allies, 
who ran as the Progressive Encounter. 
</P>
<P>
 In declaring Sanguinetti the winner early today, Cifras said the trend was 
"irreversible." Projections by another firm, Equipos Consultores, confirmed 
Sanguinetti's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanguinetti will take office March 1, five years after ending his first term. 
The veteran political insider previously served as a congressman, minister of 
industry and commerce and minister of education and culture. He will succeed 
President Luis Alberto Lacalle of the Blanco Party. 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, Sanguinetti portrayed himself as a social democrat. He 
criticized Lacalle for rushing into the Mercosur free-trade agreement with 
neighboring South American countries without adequately preparing Uruguay for 
foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today we are all workers in the foundry of Uruguayan democracy," Sanguinetti 
said in a short victory speech to cheering supporters. "I simply say I assume 
this responsibility understanding that I must be the first in effort." 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 20 presidential candidates ran. Sanguinetti's closest rivals were 
lawyer Alberto Volonte and former Interior Minister Juan Andres Ramirez of the 
governing National Party, and Socialist Party physician Tabare Vazquez of the 
Broad Front coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 The race marked the first time that a third political force has seriously 
challenged the Colorado and Blanco parties, which have dominated Uruguayan 
politics for 158 years. The Broad Front coalition includes Vazquez's Socialist 
Party, the Communist Party and former Tupamaro guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, when Tupamaro violence shook Uruguay's political foundations, the 
armed forces shut down the Congress and imposed a harshly repressive regime. 
Sanguinetti, elected in 1984, was the first civilian president after military 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanguinetti's Colorado Party lost power in 1989 elections, and Lacalle took 
office in March, 1990. The constitution bars presidents from running for 
successive terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broad Front won 21% of the vote in 1989, nearly 18 percentage points 
behind the winning Blancos. Analysts attribute the growth of the Broad Front 
partly to Vazquez's popularity in Montevideo, where he was mayor until July. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters also have grown impatient with Uruguay's slow economic recovery under 
Colorado and Blanco administrations after decades of stagnation and decline, 
the analysts say. Many young Uruguayans, less steeped in the two-party system 
than their parents, voted for the third force. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington Aguirre, 19, said he voted for the Broad Front because he wants to 
try something different from the Colorado and Blanco administrations he has 
seen. "I didn't like them," Aguirre said. "It's always the same, always 
traditional. They don't change things." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's balloting was also for mayors and members of Congress. The next 
president will face the challenge of getting legislation through a Congress in 
which an array of opposition parties will hold an overwhelming majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Another challenge for the five-year administration will be adjusting Uruguay's 
small economy to Mercosur, which eliminates import tariffs beginning Jan. 1 
among Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
 The market of 200 million people offers new opportunities for Uruguayan 
industry and agriculture but also opens them up to competition from stronger 
and more advanced producers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Uruguayan constitution allows more than one presidential candidate from 
each party, and each party's first-place candidate gets all his party's votes. 
The Colorado Party had four presidential candidates; the Blanco Party, three; 
and the Broad Front, one.

MAJORITY SUPPORT STEPS TO DIVERSITY IN THE WORKPLACE, TIMES POLL FINDS; 
EMPLOYMENT: DESPITE REPORTS OF FRICTION, MOST BACK EFFORTS TOWARD EQUAL 
OPPORTUNITY. MORE THAN 80% SAY RACE RELATIONS AT THE OFFICE ARE GOOD. 
</P>

<P>
 You are black, Latino, female. These are grand days of opportunity in the 
American work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe not so grand. 
</P>
<P>
 And white males trying to climb the career ladder? Your timing is rotten. But 
you still hold all the best jobs, don't you? 
</P>
<P>
 "The only sin which we never forgive in each other," said Ralph Waldo Emerson, 
"is difference of opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 For a generation, Americans worked under a loose-knit addendum to our social 
contract called "affirmative action." Now affirmative action has evolved into 
"diversity." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are we claiming that we want to pry open the doors of opportunity, 
but we are all being asked to appreciate our racial, gender and cultural 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensuing social friction showers us with hot sparks: Million-dollar legal 
judgments for workplace harassment. Demands and boycotts; counter-demands and 
backlash. Income disparities by color and gender. Anger met by rage. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it's enough to make us ask: Is diversity a great American flop? 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, no. 
</P>
<P>
 In a national survey of 987 American workers conducted last summer, the Los 
Angeles Times Poll found more agreement over workplace diversity than news 
headlines might suggest. And the poll found that a large majority either 
supports current efforts or is willing to do more to push toward equality of 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked, 83% of respondents said race relations were good to excellent at 
their place of employment, and this included 52% of African Americans surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Among blacks, 46% said they had suffered discrimination on the job in the last 
five years. An equal number said they had not. 
</P>
<P>
 As for workplace relations between men and women, 88% of the respondents said 
things were good to excellent, including 91% of the women. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 18% of the women surveyed said they had been subjected to gender 
discrimination in the workplace during the last five years, versus 10% of the 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 Have we gone too far in the quest for diversity? 
</P>
<P>
 In the poll, 30% of respondents said the nation has gone overboard with 
attempts to guarantee minorities a fair shake in the workplace, but 26% said 
more effort is needed. And 39% put themselves in the middle, agreeing that 
enough is being done. 
</P>
<P>
 Blacks and whites, however, view America differently: 66% of blacks want more 
aggressive efforts, while only 19% of whites want to go faster. 
</P>
<P>
 How about efforts to equalize opportunities for women? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Only 16% of respondents were in the backlash category of saying 
America is going overboard. Another 31% said they want more effort. And 48% 
were in the middle, saying enough is being done now. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll found that female and black respondents were more eager to speed up 
the process, while whites and men were more likely to say they are content with 
the pace of diversity efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 In this regard, polls are tricky. Reword the questions slightly and the 
numbers can shift. And people respond differently to the same questions, 
depending on their race and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent lecture on racism, Houston attorney Xavier Lemond explained: 
"White people look at discrimination from an individual point of view. White 
people come up to me and say: 'My parents taught me never to be prejudiced -- 
look at our maid, Suzie, she's like one of the family.' . . . Blacks look at 
discrimination from a societal point of view -- whoever does it to the least of 
my brethren does it to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, at the very time when America depicts itself -- and is depicted abroad 
-- as a country divided, a large majority of Americans seem to support 
workplace diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 And even in the polarized politics of the 1990s, 57% of respondents who 
describe themselves as politically conservative say they favor current efforts 
to guarantee fairness in the workplace -- or want even more done. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews conducted across the nation, a common theme emerged: Americans 
regard diversity differently than other social movements. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it touches our lives and ambitions as directly as any matter of public 
policy. The goal itself reflects a remarkable turn of human events, a society 
striving to make good on the high-minded promise of justice sounded in its 
Constitution and Declaration of Independence. 
</P>
<P>
 But diversity lacks the exultation that has sustained America through other 
struggles. 
</P>
<P>
 Few workers among us rejoice at being part of a noble cause. No leader stands 
up to inspire us, no martyr lays down sacrifices we can follow, no call to 
action is lofty enough to be recorded in Bartlett's Familiar Quotations. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the process of diversity is bureaucratic, its vernacular legalistic, 
its victims and beneficiaries often dehumanized as mere fine print in this new 
social contract. Our politicians and business managers cling to a stubborn 
contradiction: Diversity is not a matter of quotas, oh no. But how else can 
progress be measured except to count the numbers? 
</P>
<P>
 For the worse, and for the better, diversity has altered our concepts of 
merit. And it comes at a time when the nature of employment itself is 
undergoing broad change. 
</P>
<P>
 So we confront diversity as a personal matter. We are not crusading. We are 
coping. 
</P>
<P>
 We drink society's medicine, and we decide ourselves if it comes from a glass 
half full or half empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Robinson sells cars in Denver. He strides confidently on the lot. He is 
the only African American at the dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoppers, he says, "expect to see a guy in a tie who is white. And if they see 
a black guy, it can create more anxiety. Even black customers have a tendency 
not to want to deal with black salesmen." 
</P>
<P>
 Angry? Sometimes. Hurt? Yes. Resigned? Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he learned the trade from an African American who humiliated him and 
made his life miserable. "He taught me the guy who takes the most makes the 
most." He taught the young man to cope. 
</P>
<P>
 So Robinson teams up with a white salesman sometimes. The partner softens the 
buyer and then Robinson is introduced into the deal as the supposed "floor 
manager." It's the old good-guy, bad-guy routine. But because Robinson is 
introduced as someone with power over the deal, he is given respect. "As soon 
as they perceive me as someone who can give them what they want, color isn't an 
issue anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes prejudice explodes in his face, and a manager or customer utters a 
racist jape. That only hardens his resolve. "If a guy comes in and treats me 
like ---- and calls me a lowlife . . . that's the guy I'm going to make all my 
money on. I go to the bank and say: 'I've got $3,000 of that guy's money in my 
pocket.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's circumstance falls short of the American ideal. But he measures 
progress. It's a job, not a life, he said. "I took a lot of abuse to get where 
I am in car sales. I look at it victoriously at the end of the month when I get 
my paycheck." 
</P>
<P>
 Onetime Los Angeles area gang member Anna Gill now works in Houston. A Latina, 
she perhaps typifies the incomplete but incremental progress America has made. 
</P>
<P>
 In moving from one job to another, she has gone from hopelessness to hope. 
That itself is a great distance. But Gill feels it is further still from hope 
to reality. 
</P>
<P>
 She remembers her job as a fund-raiser at New Orleans Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very chauvinistic and racist. When they hired a young white male, 
younger than me, I had to train him. I said, that was it. I knew what his 
salary was. It was more than mine. I knew where his job was going, which was 
higher than mine. They didn't really believe in me. They saw my race, they 
didn't see me." 
</P>
<P>
 Now she is an alumni fund-raiser at the University of Houston. And she says 
she has hope because of a supervisor who is committed to having a diverse work 
force, to promoting minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're moving ahead," Gill said. "But not fast enough. . . . Racism is here 
forever, in one form or another, I'm sorry to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Because workplace diversity is so personal, our feelings are often ambivalent, 
sometimes contradictory. 
</P>
<P>
 If asked, we're apt to say anything, including the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the nation, any number of companies congratulate one another for 
progress in diversifying work forces, and their efforts are held up as examples 
in their communities. But a good number of these companies would rather leave 
it there. Big firms like the Bank of America in Los Angeles and Corning Glass 
in New York, and smaller ones like Quark Inc. in Denver, all refused requests 
by The Times to explore their diversity programs firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
 An exception is the Atlanta Marriott Marquis Hotel. Come over and you'll see 
all kinds of diversity, a manager offered. 
</P>
<P>
 No tally sheet was necessary. Not only could you see diversity at the hotel, 
you could feel it. 
</P>
<P>
 David Hill lost both of his legs to a land mine in Vietnam. He started his 
career at the Marriott as a furniture repair specialist. From his wheelchair, 
he could easily refinish wood. But to advance, he needed a way to operate a 
sewing machine so he could repair upholstery too. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill and his supervisor put their heads together. For less than 50 cents, they 
devised what Hill calls his "foot" -- a simple rod and wooden block that 
enables him to operate the sewing machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy," he says, rolling through the lobby to his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Griffieth has the skeletal disease scoliosis. He had been a custodian 
when he joined the hotel staff as a trainee two years ago through a program 
sponsored by Goodwill Industries. His small, frail body was not up to that job. 
</P>
<P>
 Today he is guest services coordinator. "I really didn't have any idea I would 
get that far," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diversity is personal, but its actualization is not. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffieth nods to the computer at his desk. "I didn't have a lot of experience 
dealing with technical equipment. But I enjoyed people. I look at some of the 
associates I work with who have college degrees and see myself here without a 
degree. And they're anxious to help me and educate me." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it helps that the hotel's human resources director did not come from a 
university business school but up from the ranks of waitresses. 
</P>
<P>
 And if it matters -- and it probably does in a story about diversity -- Hill 
and Griffieth are African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll asked Americans their views of diversity training at the 
workplace -- a phenomenon that has swept across businesses nationwide. 
Sixty-two percent of respondents said they believe that these sessions are 
worthwhile in raising sensitivities to race and gender differences. 
</P>
<P>
 One company that offers such consultation and training is Gamma Vision of 
Seattle. For a round-table discussion, it gathered workers and managers from 
two of its public-works clients, Puget Power and Pierce County Transit. The 
purpose: to explore views on diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 On some points, these front-line employees shared a consensus. As practiced at 
the workplace today, diversity can shape conduct but not always attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people's minds will never change. But you can at least let them know 
certain kinds of behavior are not acceptable at the workplace," said Stephanie 
Ostmann, a human-resources trainer for the transit system. 
</P>
<P>
 They also agreed that progress was being made, but not secured. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're downsizing. . . . And we're going to end up losing a lot of the people 
we worked really hard to move into the crafts," said Barbara Revo, manager of 
labor relations for the power company. 
</P>
<P>
 In her frustration, she joined in a conversation about technology and 
diversity. Maybe that's the answer to all our prejudice. Put everybody behind a 
computer screen at home. Filter our contact with each other until everyone 
assumes the digitalized shape of their software program. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't tell a person's color, you wouldn't know whether they were tall 
or short or fat or thin," she remarked. 
</P>
<P>
 That offered little consolation to bus driver Ronda Barfield. "I don't think 
any time soon we're going to find a computer to drive the buses." 
</P>
<P>
 So like millions of other Americans, Barfield copes. 
</P>
<P>
 She is a beneficiary of this epic struggle for justice. Only within her 
lifetime have women gained the peacetime opportunity to operate buses in Pierce 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 But she is still its victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day as the shifts change, drivers gather to gossip and gripe at the 
dispatch center. "The lobby experience," they call it. And the male-dominated 
culture of the past clings to its traditions: The banter is raw and salacious. 
</P>
<P>
 Barfield avoids the dispatch lobby and sits alone in her car each day until 
one minute before her shift begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason, I personally happen to be the topic of conversation. The 
less they see me, the less they talk about me." 
</P>
<P>
 Times researchers Doug Conner in Seattle, Lianne Hart in Houston, Ann Rovin in 
Denver and Edith Stanley in Atlanta contributed to this story. How Americans 
View Diversity Efforts 
</P>
<P>
 A national survey of 987 working Americans found that many believe efforts to 
promote fairness for minorities are adequate. But there are many discrepancies 
between how various groups view such efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 MAJOR GAPS IN WHAT THEY SEE 
</P>
<P>
 Believe more effort is needed to guarantee racial minorities fairness in the 
workplace: Whites: 19% Blacks: 66% * 
</P>
<P>
 Have been discriminated against in the workplace because of race or ethnic 
background in last five years: Whites: 11% Blacks: 46% * 
</P>
<P>
 Believe race relations at their workplace are good or excellent: Whites: 87% 
Blacks: 52% * 
</P>
<P>
 Believe more effort is needed these days to guarantee that women get fair 
treatment in the workplace: Men: 26% Women: 38% Numbers do not add up to 100% 
because all responses are not shown.

 President Clinton and his family returned to the White House on Sunday after a 
four-day stay at the snow-covered Camp David presidential retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a brown sweater and matching jacket, Clinton bounded off Marine One 
with a smile, clapping his hands together once. Returning with the Clintons and 
their daughter, Chelsea, were his stepfather, Richard Kelley, and the First 
Lady's mother, Dorothy Rodham. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House said Clinton spent a quiet Thanksgiving weekend in the 
Catoctin Mountains in Maryland.

SNOW SHUTS TWIN CITIES AIRPORT; WEATHER: MACKINAC BRIDGE IN UPPER MICHIGAN IS 
CLOSED TO TRAFFIC BECAUSE OF HIGH WINDS. TORNADOES IN TENNESSEE SPUN OFF BY 
THUNDERSTORMS KILL TWO.

<P>
 A blustery snowstorm shut down the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport 
for part of the afternoon Sunday, one of the busiest travel days of the year, 
and canceled about 100 airline flights. 
</P>
<P>
 Thunderstorms along the storm's southern edge spun off tornadoes in Tennessee, 
killing two people. High wind in Arkansas killed several cattle and pitched 
their carcasses into treetops. 
</P>
<P>
 The snowstorm ended a relatively warm, dry autumn in the upper Midwest. It was 
the latest date for Minnesota's first significant snowfall of the season in 
about 20 years, according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mackinac Bridge in upper Michigan was closed to traffic Sunday evening 
because of high winds. People in the Upper Peninsula were advised to stay off 
the roads because of blowing snow and decreasing visibility. 
</P>
<P>
 About six inches of snow fell in two hours at the airport in the Twin Cities 
suburb of Bloomington, reducing visibility to just one-eighth of a mile, 
airport spokesman John Ostrom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flights during the morning were delayed and the airport was forced to shut for 
about 90 minutes in the afternoon, Ostrom said. One of the two main runways 
opened after the wind died and visibility improved. 
</P>
<P>
 About 32,000 people were scheduled to fly through Northwest Airlines' 
Minneapolis hub Sunday, said airline spokesman Jon Austin. About 10% of those 
travelers were affected when an estimated 100 Northwest flights were canceled, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In western Tennessee, tornadoes touched down in Crockett, Fayette, Weakley and 
Shelby counties, said Dan Pitchford, spokesman for the state Emergency 
Management Agency. One person was killed in the town of Friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 A second person died when two tornadoes touched down in the Memphis suburb of 
Germantown, according to the Shelby County Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind gusted between 50 and 60 m.p.h. in parts of Arkansas. A mobile home was 
carried 20 yards and dropped upside down, Sharp County sheriff's office 
dispatcher Donna Middlebrook said. The three people inside were treated for 
cuts and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three cows were killed. It put them up in some trees," Middlebrook said. 
"We've got a johnboat about 30 feet off the ground in some pine trees." 
</P>
<P>
 In the region of snowfall, more than 100 traffic accidents, mostly 
fender-benders but some with injuries, were reported in the Minneapolis area, 
said Lisa Dockery, a dispatcher at the Hennepin County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures dropped as low as 8 below zero in Butte, Mont., and Rollinsville, 
Colo., had a wind-chill equivalent of 41 below. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nebraska, snow and ice brought down power lines.

 A priest wanted in the sexual assault of a 13-year-old New Jersey girl was 
arrested as he prepared to board a plane for Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Level Eliscard, 28, was arrested Saturday at John F. Kennedy 
International Airport, officials said. He was charged with aggravated sexual 
contact and endangering the welfare of a child, according to police in Hamilton 
Township, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliscard apparently realized he was a suspect and tried to leave the country, 
police allege. A tip from a member of his predominantly Haitian parish led 
police to the airport.

O.C. PRECINCT TYPIFIES LATINO VOTER APATHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Poor, undereducated and struggling with the everyday pathos that plagues 
immigrant communities such as theirs, residents of a mostly Latino neighborhood 
in central Santa Ana have had little reason to hope for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 They live in a world fraught with worry about making the next rent payment or 
about crime on the streets just outside their crowded houses. Their experience 
with government is at best nonexistent and at worst a nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 So the notion that their lives might be made better by casting a ballot is as 
fanciful as winning the lottery. They don't vote in this neighborhood, Precinct 
68302, just south of the Civic Center. What's the point? 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks before the Nov. 8 election, Democrats and Latino political 
activists surmised that this year would be different, that if there was ever an 
election that gave Latino voters a reason to go to the polls, this was it. 
</P>
<P>
 One draw for Latino voters in Santa Ana, the political pundits guessed, would 
be the mayoral ballot, where five of the eight candidates had Spanish surnames, 
among them Councilman Miguel A. Pulido Jr., himself an immigrant. In addition, 
debate was raging over Proposition 187, the anti-illegal immigration measure 
that surely was resonating in neighborhoods such as this one. 
</P>
<P>
 But the political experts were wrong. Latinos in Precinct 68302, as in the 
rest of the state, generally decided to sit out this election, even after the 
Democrats pumped more than $85,000 and volunteers into Santa Ana and parts of 
Anaheim to register new voters and get out the vote on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, the sleeping giant remained in a deep slumber. 
</P>
<P>
 Long talked about in national politics as having the potential to influence 
public policy because of their increasing numbers, Latino voters, including 
those in Precinct 68302, seemed untouched by political campaigns and issues 
that were striking close to home. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, when the nation elected a new President, only 45.4% of the 
registered voters in Precinct 68302 cast ballots, compared to a countywide 
total of 73%. It was the lowest turnout for any precinct in the heavily Latino 
69th Assembly District, which itself has one of the lowest numbers of eligible 
voters in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the voter turnout in this neighborhood was lower -- 30.8% compared 
to 66% countywide. The voter apathy was even more pronounced in view of the 
fact that there were seven other precincts in the 69th Assembly District with 
even lower voter turnouts than Precinct 68302. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Latinos made up only 5% of the total Orange County vote on Election 
Day, no change from the June primary, according to a Los Angeles Times Exit 
Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 "What actually happened on Election Day is a mystery to me," said Roderick 
Castro, a 22-year-old Westminster resident who worked on the campaign for 
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown. He was charged with 
organizing the 34 central Orange County precincts targeted by the Brown 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was such a great movement of new people who were claiming they were 
going to get out to vote for the first time," Castro recalled. "It's going to 
take me a while to get over it. . . . The amount of indifference and ignorance 
was absolutely incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 The indifference is rooted in residents like Maria, a 52-year-old grandmother 
who said she has been a citizen for 18 years but has never voted. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing outside the Camile Street home where she cares for two grandchildren, 
Maria, who asked that her last name not be used, folded her arms across her 
chest as she admitted her disinterest in voting. Her life does not intersect 
with the world of politics, and she was unaware that the election had already 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Is she worried about taxes? "Sure, one worries, but . . . " she said, her 
voice trailing off as she shrugged. Did she pay attention to the debate over 
Proposition 187? "It's only for those who don't have papers, right?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The voter cynicism was painfully obvious to Rocio Fregoso, a 17-year-old high 
school senior who was in charge of getting out the vote in Precinct 68302 for 
the Brown campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the talk (about Proposition 187) and school walkouts, we thought 
people were going to get the hint" and vote, Fregoso said. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Election Day, as she called on voters -- not just one time, but two, 
three and even four times -- she heard a common refrain: "Kathleen Brown is not 
going to win anyway, so why should I bother? Why should I waste my time?" she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fregoso said she discovered that for all the hype, some neighbors were 
uninformed about the ballot measures, including Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was one man who lived two houses away from where the voting poll was 
and he said he did not know it was Election Day," Fregoso said incredulously. 
"He said, 'I'm kind of embarrassed to go. I don't know what to do.' So I told 
him I would take him and help him." 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of neighborliness is an uncommon trait these days in Precinct 68302, 
which is bounded by Myrtle, Flower and Bristol streets and McFadden Avenue. It 
has gone from a predominantly white, owner-occupied neighborhood to a mostly 
Latino enclave of renters living in housing owned by absentee landlords. 
</P>
<P>
 Tidy homes with manicured lawns are interspersed among properties that show 
the wear and tear of a community in transition. Iron fences and bars on windows 
are found on many of the ranch-style homes and scattered apartment buildings. 
Residents eye strangers warily and say they don't know their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the state of her neighborhood, Virginia Knudtson, a 69-year-old 
Democrat, said flatly, "The Mexicans have taken over Santa Ana." 
</P>
<P>
 The changing demographics of the neighborhood -- which is now largely 
immigrant and transient -- proved to be a big challenge for the Brown campaign 
workers who set out to find Democrats who had voted in the 1992 presidential 
election but not in the 1990 gubernatorial race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably the biggest problem we had that we could not overcome was that most 
of the voters were unidentifiable," campaign worker Castro said. "It's a 
transient precinct. We didn't have voting history on a large number of voters. 
Most of the people that we had on our voters list who voted in 1992 had moved 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 Fregoso said that many voters on her list did not have working telephone 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The boundaries of Precinct 68302 had changed slightly from 1992, and some new 
voters had been added as a result of an intensive voter registration drive 
directed by state Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and the California Democratic 
Party. By Election Day, Latinos made up 72% of those registered to vote in the 
precinct. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the precinct's new voters were Olga and Josie Fernandez, 19-year-old 
twin sisters who said they would have sat out the election had it not been for 
their anger at Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think immigration was the major issue of Proposition 187," Josie 
Fernandez said. "They're always attacking the Mexicans." 
</P>
<P>
 While the turnout was low, the results in Precinct 68302 showed definite 
tendencies among those who did vote. 
</P>
<P>
 * All of the Democrats solidly beat their Republican rivals. Among Democrats, 
Brown received the largest number of votes, followed by state Sen. Art Torres 
in his unsuccessful bid for state insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among Republicans, Rep. Robert K. Dornan of Garden Grove was the top 
vote-getter for his party in aggregate votes, followed by state 
Assemblyman-elect Jim Morrissey, who heavily courted the Latino vote, and Gov. 
Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 * Proposition 187 was voted against by 63% of the precinct's voters. 
</P>
<P>
 * A candidate with a Spanish surname was likely to pick up votes even if not 
from a major party. For example, in the race for lieutenant governor, Peace and 
Freedom candidate J. Luis Gomez finished only four votes behind Republican 
Cathie Wright. The Green Party's candidate in the secretary of state race, 
Margaret Garcia, finished three votes behind Republican Bill Jones. In both 
those races, the Democrats beat the Republicans by about 2-to-1 ratios. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three Santa Ana City Council races, Ana Y. Vasquez beat Robert L. 
Richardson; Tony Espinoza got more votes than Alberta Christy; and Noemi C. 
Romero received more votes than her four Anglo-surnamed opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 And of the 12 Supreme Court and appellate court justices who were running 
unopposed, five received more "no" than "yes" votes. The seven who got positive 
ratings scored between 52% and 58% of the vote, except for one -- Appellate 
Court Justice Manuel A. Ramirez, who garnered 81% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 * The proposed commercial airport at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, 
which was touted by proponents as a creator of jobs, was approved by 58% of the 
voters in this precinct. 
</P>
<P>
 John Palacio, the local leadership director for the Mexican American Legal 
Defense and Education Fund, said the results from Precinct 68302 typify the 
Latino vote elsewhere in the state: Latinos tend to vote Democratic, but they 
will cross party lines if they believe a Spanish-surnamed candidate can 
represent them better. 
</P>
<P>
 "Latinos have a greater tendency to split party votes than any other ethnic 
group," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Palacio also noted the efforts of the Morrissey campaign, which broke 
Republican precedent by campaigning directly to Latino voters even though 
Morrissey strongly supported Proposition 187. Morrissey received 37% of the 
precinct's vote -- a good number for a Republican in that area -- and went on 
to win the 69th Assembly District seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrissey's campaign consultant, Mark Q. Thompson, said internal polls showed 
support for Proposition 187 throughout the district, even among Latino voters. 
So the campaign ran English- and Spanish-language telephone banks and searched 
for voters who had witnessed the demographic changes in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "The long-term members in the community were the ones who were scared about 
crime, saw illegal immigration as a problem, not as a Latino problem but a 
problem as a whole, and who were worried about jobs and the economy," Thompson 
said. "And those were the people who were going to get out to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 However, while the politicians did not ignore the Latino vote, the turnout 
suggests that Latino voters continue to ignore the political process. Despite 
the promise of an emerging political power based on their large numbers, 
Latinos here remain nearly invisible from a political standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino activists say that results partly from the young age of the ethnic 
group and partly because many are still in the process of becoming citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 But Castro said there is also a feeling among Latinos that their votes do not 
count, that their interests are not going to be represented even if they vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The less represented you are (by a politician), the less reason there is to 
believe that anything you do is going to trickle down to your doorstep," Castro 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Stiens, a Democratic campaign consultant who has run campaigns in Santa 
Ana but did not work here in the November election, said Democrats face a 
tremendous challenge if they want to mobilize the Latino vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have a lot of work to do," Stiens said, "not only in registering 
Latinos, but giving them a reason to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Ken Ellingwood contributed to this report. Portrait of a 
Precinct 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana's Precinct 68302 is an example of poor Latino voter participation. 
U.S. Census tract 749.02, which substantially overlaps this precinct, estimated 
the Latino population at 7,278 as of January, 1994. Almost two-thirds of the 
population in the tract is estimated to be of voting age. A look at the 
precinct's participation in 1994:

NEWS ANALYSIS; ASSEMBLY LIKELY TO REVIVE VALLEY BID TO LEAVE LAUSD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new Republican dominance of the state Assembly will probably spark a fresh 
legislative attempt to break San Fernando Valley schools away from the massive 
Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The shift of political dynamics also seems certain to reawaken the efforts of 
gun advocates to undermine the assault-weapons ban authored by outgoing state 
Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys). 
</P>
<P>
 These are just two of the Valley-based issues that may emerge in the wake of 
the Republican sweep and the possible ouster of longtime Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
 It has been Brown's vehement opposition -- and his fierce allegiance to 
teachers unions -- that hopelessly stalled the perennial effort by LAUSD 
critics to secede from the mammoth district. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with Republicans holding a 41-39 edge in the Assembly and Brown 
vulnerable to a takeover by Assemblyman Jim Brulte (R-Rancho Cucamonga), new 
support for the school district breakup movement is one of several scenarios 
likely to result. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at some of the people and issues that stand to gain -- or lose 
-- in the Valley delegation if Republicans seize control for the first time in 
a generation after the Assembly reconvenes next Monday: Paula Boland 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Paula Boland (R-Granada Hills) is a favorite to inherit the 
chair of the Assembly Public Safety Committee, the clearinghouse for crime 
bills and gun-control legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 As the ranking Republican on the committee, Boland has served as vice 
chairwoman of the eight-member panel and has carved out a reputation as an 
advocate for victims' rights. Awarding Boland the chair would bolster her 
chances of getting more anti-crime legislation passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Boland declined to speculate on whether she might be elevated to the 
prestigious post, but said she had full faith that Brulte would wrestle the 
Speaker's job from Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe Jim Brulte will be Speaker, and he'll make those decisions when 
he's elected," she said, noting she "might be interested" in accepting such a 
responsibility if asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The heightened stature -- combined with the possibility of Brown's removal as 
Speaker -- would improve the outlook for Boland's legislation paving the way 
for Valley reformists to seek autonomy from the LAUSD. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Boland has submitted a bill for the new session opening next week. 
The measure mirrors another one she had last year that faltered in the face of 
Brown's accusations that the breakup attempt was little more than veiled 
racism. 
</P>
<P>
 Boland pointed to the LAUSD's lawsuit challenging Proposition 187 as the 
latest example of the need to split away from the larger Los Angeles district. 
</P>
<P>
 "The audacity of this school board," Boland said, "to have heard the voice of 
the voters and turn around and use taxpayer education dollars to file a lawsuit 
when there were ample suits filed. 
</P>
<P>
 "And this, when they say they don't have the money to educate kids and hire 
nurses," she said. "It's another sign that they have got to be broken up and 
somebody's got to put a stop to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Boland said her office phones have been "ringing off the wall" with calls from 
school breakup supporters heartened by reports of change afoot in Sacramento. 
Gun Control 
</P>
<P>
 The gun-control legacy of Sen. Roberti could come under fire in the new 
Assembly as pro-gun groups rally legislators in an anticipated attempt to 
weaken the 1989 Roberti-Roos Assault Weapon Control Act. 
</P>
<P>
 According to John Stoos of Gun Owners of California Inc., which backed last 
April's attempted recall of Roberti, the organization will not go so far as to 
try to repeal the assault weapon ban. 
</P>
<P>
 But it will attempt to muster up the 46 pro-gun votes it now calculates it has 
in the Assembly to remove certain semiautomatic weapons from the bill's 
provisions -- in effect, "cleaning up" the law's definition of assault weapons, 
Stoos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, pro-gun forces counted solid support among 37 Assembly members. 
Stoos said the new, larger vote margin will also allow his organization to push 
for new legislation allowing people to legally carry concealed weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, however, Stoos said only 18 members consistently favor his 
group's position on loosening up gun-control laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Any attempt to water down the Roberti-Roos Act would probably face stiff 
opposition in the Senate, where Roberti -- who is retiring this year due to 
term limits -- is remembered fondly. Bill Hoge 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Bill Hoge (R-Pasadena), who represents the Sunland-Tujunga area, 
also stands to benefit from the Assembly's switch to a Republican majority and 
anticipated selection of a GOP Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge is mentioned as a possible chairman of the Assembly Governmental 
Organization Committee, a panel that serves as gatekeeper for gambling, 
racetrack, liquor and lottery legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of the committee for the past two years, Hoge -- already the 
assistant Republican Whip in the Assembly -- often advised other Republicans on 
the panel when it came to voting on bills. 
</P>
<P>
 An ascension to the chairmanship, however, may serve to again focus attention 
on Hoge's ties to gambling interests -- horse racing in particular -- that 
contributed $140,000 to his campaigns since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the issue surfaced in the campaign, Hoge captured a larger percentage 
of the vote -- 53% -- than he did when first elected in 1992 with the backing 
of 51% of the electorate. His anti-crime, tax-cutting, pro-business platform 
stands more of a chance at producing results with fellow Republicans in power. 
James Rogan 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman James Rogan (R-Glendale) is the successor to Assemblyman Pat 
Nolan, who went to prison on a political corruption charge. Rogan is likely to 
gain a firm toehold in a Republican-dominated Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarded as a bright, amiable colleague by members on both sides of the 
partisan aisle, Rogan is mentioned as a candidate to head the Assembly 
Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he says he is not campaigning for the position, Rogan concedes that 
his background as a former Glendale Municipal Court judge and prosecutor could 
make him a natural contender. 
</P>
<P>
 With nothing set in stone, Rogan's resume could also help him outdistance 
Boland should an open contest erupt for the chairmanship of the Public Safety 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, Rogan has an agenda of his own that he hopes to push in the wake 
of the power shift -- reforming the rules for lawmaking at the Statehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a Republican majority, I'm very optimistic that some of the legislative 
reform concepts I've been working on will see the light of day -- that the 
leadership will help get those to the floor for a vote," Rogan said. 
</P>
<P>
 To Rogan's eye, too little time is allotted for legislators to study up on the 
complex proposed laws they vote on every day. And too many of those measures 
lack merit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see the rules of the house changed so legislators have more 
opportunities to cast more informed votes," Rogan said. "I'd also like to see 
the rules changed so there is less frivolous legislation." Richard Katz 
</P>
<P>
 As for those vulnerable to losing critical committee chairmanships should a 
Republican Speaker win control of the lower house, Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar) leads the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if his longtime stewardship of the Assembly Transportation Committee 
panel would be endangered by a changeover to a Republican Speaker, Katz was 
blunt. "It's not in jeopardy -- it's gone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, Katz predicts an erosion in the Valley's clout in the 
competition for state transportation funds. "In terms of the Valley," he said, 
"it will certainly hurt our ability to complete sound-wall projects and get 
money at budget time." 
</P>
<P>
 During his tenure as head of the transportation committee, Katz has taken on a 
watchdog's role when it has come to monitoring Caltrans. He has delved so 
deeply into transportation issues that last year it was rumored the Clinton 
Administration sought him for a position with the U. S. Department of 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz fears that the activist course he set for the transportation committee 
will unravel in the hands of Republicans should they take over the reins of the 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Republicans take over, for one thing it means that the effort we've 
made to hold Caltrans accountable on earthquake retrofitting problems will 
probably stop," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 At any rate, Katz said, he doubted that Brulte would scrape together enough 
votes to displace Brown -- a cunning politician who is at his best when his 
leadership is challenged. Even though Republicans now command 41 seats -- 
enough to elect a new Speaker -- not all GOP members fall in lock-step behind 
Brulte, Katz maintains. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the Republican sweep, Katz did not deny speculation that he's 
considering a run for the Los Angeles City Council. "One of the things my wife 
and I are doing now is assessing the future," he said. "I haven't closed any 
doors at this point."

CAMPAIGN AIDE GETS A CITIZENSHIP LESSON; ELECTION: RESIDENT ALIEN SERVES AS 
BROWN VOLUNTEER IN LARGELY LATINO SANTA ANA PRECINCT AND IS SHOCKED TO SEE THE 
DEPTH OF VOTER APATHY. SOON TO TAKE HER OATH, SHE PLEDGES TO MEET HER 
RESPONSIBILITIES.

<P>
 It wasn't an altruistic impulse that led Rocio Fregoso last month to the Santa 
Ana campaign headquarters of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Fregoso was there to fulfill a high school government class assignment. She 
figured she would work for one day and then leave. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Brown campaign needed volunteer workers, and the 17-year-old student 
wanted to earn extra credit for her class. She was persuaded to stay on and 
help find Brown supporters in her predominantly Latino neighborhood, Precinct 
68302. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost overnight, the campaign became an avocation for this new precinct 
captain who had paid little attention to politics before. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Fregoso had been old enough to vote in the Nov. 8 election, she still 
would have been ineligible. She is a resident alien who is in the process of 
becoming a U.S. citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time the election was over, she had witnessed the unwillingness of 
her neighbors to vote and in the process gained an even stronger appreciation 
of the right to participate in an election. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are a citizen, then you should vote," Fregoso said. 
</P>
<P>
 When she first joined the campaign, she said, she was anxious about the 
prospect of telephoning voters or knocking on their doors. "I was embarrassed 
at first," she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 But she forged ahead, becoming her neighborhood's expert on who were the 
occasional voters and who had moved away. Fregoso and others also called the 
few voters on their list who had working telephone numbers, and she handed out 
campaign brochures to neighbors with her name and number in case anyone had any 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she discovered that many voters in her neighborhood did not want to be 
bothered -- a feeling she picked up almost as soon as she set out on the rainy 
morning of the election to get out the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all the effort we were putting forward contacting them, on the day of 
the election they said they didn't have time," Fregoso said. "A lot of people 
said, 'I don't have time to vote,' or this and that. Others were like: 'Don't 
bug me no more. I will go when I have time to vote.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Her campaign supervisor told her not to give up. "He said, 'Keep going and bug 
them and bug them,' Fregoso said. "But a lot of people didn't know it was 
Election Day." 
</P>
<P>
 It was exasperating for Fregoso, who, like other campaign workers, thought the 
presence of Proposition 187 -- the illegal immigrant measure -- would draw more 
Latino voters to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends at school were talking about student walkouts to protest the measure, 
and some neighbors shared the worry that rioting would break out once the 
initiative was approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the day before the election, Fregoso's brother came home from his 
elementary school frightened, she said. He had heard that Proposition 187 would 
force his family -- although in the country legally -- to go back to Mexico and 
leave him behind in Santa Ana because he is the only U.S. citizen out of the 
eight members of the family. 
</P>
<P>
 However, for all the interest in the election, the results showed that it was 
mostly talk and little action. 
</P>
<P>
 On Election Day, Fregoso called many voters several times to remind them to 
vote. But she said they usually responded with the question: "Why should I 
waste my time?" 
</P>
<P>
 "We were trying to pep them up so they would go vote, and it was hard," the 
young campaign worker recalled. "I told them, 'You never know, anything could 
happen.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Disappointed by the low voter turnout, Fregoso said she was nonetheless 
enlightened by the experience and now looks forward to the day when she can 
vote. She expects to become a citizen in about three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes a difference whether people vote or not," she said. "After what I 
have been through . . . I learned it's worth voting and learning (how) to be 
heard."

NEVER SAY TOO OLD; LAW ENFORCEMENT: LAID-OFF DEFENSE WORKER EDWARD OLIVARES, 
59, TRAINS HARD AND SETS AN LAPD AGE RECORD AS A NEW OFFICER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 By age 59, most people are looking forward to retirement, to a time when they 
can reap the benefits of their life's work and reflect on the strange twists 
and turns along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 But at that age, rookie police Officer Edward Olivares has caught a second 
wind and is looking forward to the strange twists and turns that still lie 
ahead: 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, he took the first step of his second career, becoming the Los 
Angeles Police Department's oldest rookie ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out that LAPD was hiring and that my age was not a barrier, and I 
said to myself, 'This is something that I can be proud of for the rest of my 
life,' " Olivares said Sunday as he lifted weights before his first patrol 
shift in the Foothill Division. 
</P>
<P>
 His graduation last week from the Police Academy was the culmination of two 
years of physical training to transform himself from an overweight, laid-off 
defense worker to what he calls a "lean machine." 
</P>
<P>
 Since he left aerospace in December, 1990, Olivares has shed 65 pounds of fat, 
replacing at least part of it with 20 pounds of muscle. In between, the West 
Point graduate finished a cooking course at the famed Cordon Bleu school in 
Paris, but found chef jobs even scarcer than positions in aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
 His workout Sunday was overrun by reporters, photographers and even a few 
fellow officers who stopped by just to witness the news media spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just watched him up in the weight room and it was impressive," said 23-year 
veteran Sgt. Al Yarbrough, the station's day watch commander. "People are kind 
of in awe of this guy because we went through the academy in our 20s, and it 
was tough." 
</P>
<P>
 It was tough for Olivares too. He failed the self-defense skills test and a 
hearing exam the first time, but passed both on his second try. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to make it," he said. "There was never a time when I felt like 
quitting." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, in the first few weeks of his 28-week academy training, Olivares told 
his classmates that no one could quit until he did. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivares' new career is possible because a 1992 decision by the city's Police 
Commission abolished the department's age limit of 34 for new recruits. The 
change was made to comply with federal anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
 But Olivares was a determined man long before then. 
</P>
<P>
 After he was laid off from his job as an aerospace project leader, Olivares 
began working out. He slowly built up his endurance until his daily workout 
included a five-mile run, 20 laps in a 30-foot pool at his Calabasas condo, and 
lifting weights for 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The rookie officer is careful to point out that he is not a power lifter, that 
he trains more for endurance and conditioning than for the physiques developed 
by "gym rats." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm way past the time of being Mr. Universe," he conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest obstacles to becoming a police officer was his wife, 
Barbara. Not that she wanted to stand in the way of his dream, but she was 
concerned for his safety in the job -- particularly after the death of Christy 
Lynne Hamilton, the 45-year-old rookie who was shot and killed on duty in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivares said his wife acquiesced when he explained that the statistical odds 
of dying in a freeway crash were higher than being killed as a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three weeks, Olivares has ridden along with veteran officers to 
get a feel for the streets. Once, he drew his weapon, but only in a backup 
role. 
</P>
<P>
 On another ride-along, he and his partner answered a domestic violence call at 
a house set apart on a hill. Aware of the risks, and without cover or backup, 
the officers clung to a brick wall as they approached the house. Olivares' 
partner then made a 30-yard dash to a nearby tree while the new officer served 
as lookout. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turned out to be a non-event," he said. "The wife was the only one home." 
</P>
<P>
 Olivares is a 1957 West Point graduate who spent three years in the Army, then 
remained in the reserves with the rank of captain. As he did in his other 
working life, he plans to move up quickly in the ranks of the Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't expect to be on patrol in the streets for that long," he said. "I 
want to try to get into detectives as soon as the department allows. I want to 
use my analytical and report-writing capabilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Others think he will succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the guy should get a fair shot," Yarbrough said. "Probably about 
one-third of the people who make detective or sergeant have only four or five 
years on the job. It's a reasonable expectation."

KEEPING THE HANUKKAH LIGHTS ALIVE; JUDAISM: STUDENTS AT HEBREW ACADEMY IN NORTH 
HOLLYWOOD LEARN THAT MAKING HOLIDAY MENORAHS LINKS THEM TO A 2,100-YEAR-OLD 
TRADITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ISAAC GUZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the first day of Hanukkah, an international class of 11 students from the 
Emek Hebrew Academy gathered a few hours before Sunday's sunset to light for 
the first time their hand-crafted menorahs -- the products of simultaneous 
lessons in woodworking and Jewish law. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the tutelage of Rabbi Eleazar Eidlitz, the Orthodox students at the 
North Hollywood school spent the past week putting the finishing touches on 
their menorahs, some of which carry political and personal messages. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve-year-old Pejman Behboudikha, who grew up in Iran, had attached an inert 
World War II hand grenade and two machine gun bullets to his menorah as a plea 
for world peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "It represents (a hope) that they will stop the wars all over the world," said 
Pejman. "It's my idea of peace." 
</P>
<P>
 After removing the grenade from the menorah's pedestal and displaying its 
empty innards, Pejman explained that Rabbi Eidlitz had bought it for him at an 
army surplus store. 
</P>
<P>
 Akiva Greenfield said he, too, hopes to send a message of worldwide 
brotherhood with his menorah, shaped like a peace symbol with the word "shalom" 
-- peace in Hebrew -- engraved in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathan Kostant said the black-and-white marbled finish of his menorah was a 
statement of racial harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 Other boys placed the name of a family member on each of the eight branches of 
the menorah, a sign of the importance of family in Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanukkah is an eight-day festival that commemorates the retaking of the Jewish 
temple in Jerusalem in 165 B.C. The lighting of the eight candles of the 
menorah, one for each day of Hanukkah, harks back to the story of the 
Maccabees, who kept their lamps lit during the rededication of the temple for 
eight days, even though they had only enough oil for one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember that you are part of a tradition that has a nonstop link from more 
than 2,100 years ago," Rabbi Eidlitz told his students before they lit their 
candles. "You directly represent that link that has not been broken. (The 
Maccabees) were not allowed to practice or study their religion, and we have 
that as we have students from Russia now whose parents have had the same 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 That sense of community was evident among the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has made a menorah and everyone was helping each other," said 
Gregory Kalmanovich, from the country of Uzbekistan, a former Soviet republic. 
"The menorahs just weren't made by one person." 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Moore watched proudly as his son, Jason, stood behind his menorah. He said 
he was inspired by Rabbi Eidlitz to make his own menorah when he was 18, at a 
rabbinical school in the Bay Area. He still has the menorah and said he planned 
to light it Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The magic of Rabbi Eidlitz is really his ability to teach the boys so that 
they not only learn the laws of how to properly build a menorah so that it's 
kosher, but they also learn to work together as a team," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the menorahs were lit and the boys chanted a traditional prayer, Rabbi 
Eidlitz gave them some parting wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish you a great deal of success in the loot you will collect from your 
parents," he said, "but I hope that you will remember the Torah connection."

STREET SMART / RICH SIMON: SIGHTSEEING ON THE PHANTOM FREEWAYS OF THE SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking for a new way around town? Hop on the Reseda Freeway. Or the Beverly 
Hills Freeway. Or the Industrial Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't go flipping through your Thomas Guide looking for them; they're among 
the freeways that were envisioned, but never built. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 years ago, when the city of freeways was first conceived of, 
engineers imagined a crisscrossing of the Los Angeles region with a 1,500-mile 
dream system of freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 No neighborhood was to be more than four miles from a freeway. But the plans 
were drafted long before the words environmental impact report became the 
customary greeting from communities to construction crews in orange vests and 
hard hats. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the freeways were ultimately built -- or at least partly built. One is 
the Slauson Freeway, which became the Richard Nixon Freeway and then, after 
Watergate, the Marina Freeway. It was supposed to run from Marina del Rey to 
Orange County. But, like Nixon, it ran short of expectations, extending only 
about two miles instead of the planned 40. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 527 miles of freeways have been built in Los Angeles County, although 
they may bear little resemblance to the early plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone knows the Arroyo Seco Parkway became the Pasadena Freeway. But how 
about the Olympic Freeway -- now the Santa Monica, also known as the 
Christopher Columbus Transcontinental Highway? The Los Angeles River Freeway -- 
you know it better as the Long Beach. The Ramona Freeway, now carrying the name 
San Bernardino; the Allesandro, now the Glendale, or Frank Lanterman, Freeway 
(don't ask), and the Sepulveda -- rechristened the San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Highway Commission (which changed its own name to become 
Transportation Commission) decided that the new names, sometimes less 
picturesque, would help motorists figure out where they are going. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the Ventura Freeway began life as the Riverside Freeway, because the 
route is near the Los Angeles River, not because it has anything to do with the 
city of Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 The 91 Freeway, known as the Riverside Freeway in Orange and Riverside 
counties, is the Artesia Freeway east of the Long Beach Freeway in Los Angeles 
County. It was the Redondo Beach Freeway west of the Long Beach Freeway, but a 
few years ago, it became the Gardena Freeway. Caltrans did not make an 
announcement of the name change, according to a memo, because "except for a few 
people in Redondo and Gardena, most people don't care." 
</P>
<P>
 But many other freeways still exist only on yellowing maps, such as the Laurel 
Canyon Freeway, Pacific Coast Freeway (highway officials even talked about 
building an off-shore "causeway" -- on stilts), Reseda-to-the-Sea Freeway, and 
the Whitnall-Malibu Freeway, which would have run through the middle of the San 
Fernando Valley through Malibu Canyon to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember the Beverly Hills Freeway? It was to run from the Hollywood Freeway 
to the San Diego Freeway, generally following Santa Monica Boulevard. Caltrans 
even bought up property along the route into the early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills Freeway, like others that were never built, was scratched 
because of inadequate funding, community opposition, environmental concerns and 
strong appeals for rapid transit systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Take that big chunk of land that sits between the north- and southbound lanes 
of the Hollywood Freeway near Vermont Avenue. It was set aside for a massive 
interchange of the Hollywood, Glendale and Beverly Hills freeways -- one that 
was never built. 
</P>
<P>
 Given all that, the Century Freeway -- opened last year -- will in all 
likelihood be the last freeway built in the Los Angeles area. (Caltrans isn't 
giving up a decades-long fight to extend the Long Beach Freeway through South 
Pasadena.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Century Freeway, originally dubbed the El Segundo-Norwalk Freeway but 
officially the Glenn Anderson Freeway, after the former longtime congressman, 
cost $2.2 billion and was finished only after a decade of litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The joke about its current name is that it took nearly that long to build it. 
The project, which was to have taken no more than 10 years, consumed 23. The 
freeway also was dramatically scaled down from 10 lanes running for 51 miles 
between San Bernardino and the coast, to an eight-lane freeway 17 miles long. 
</P>
<P>
 The Auto Club several years ago called for reviving the Southern California 
freeway building program, including building a South Bay freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal drew little support except from one letter writer to The Times, 
who said: "Let's use those billions of dollars to double-deck or triple-deck 
our freeways and not waste it on a rapid transit system that will have as much 
effect on unclogging our freeway mess as one rain drop does at irrigating the 
Mojave Desert." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the state's approach to easing freeway congestion is a mix of concrete 
and microchips. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans (in addition to pursing a costly program to strengthen freeways to 
withstand earthquakes) is intent on expanding the capacity of existing freeways 
by adding car-pool lanes and instituting "traffic management" programs, such as 
100 more of those freeway message boards like the one you saw chatting with 
Steve Martin in "L.A. Story"; these more ordinary models alert motorists to 
traffic conditions. Hundreds of video cameras also will be placed on freeways 
to permit Caltrans to identify and respond more quickly to problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, the biggest freeway projects under way are construction of the 
$500-million, elevated 50-foot-high bus and car-pool "transitway" on the Harbor 
Freeway (officials insist it will be safe in an earthquake), the $1-billion 
widening of the Santa Ana Freeway through Orange County, and the extension of 
the Foothill Freeway east into San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans is looking at broadcasting continuous radio traffic reports, as is 
done for travelers at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "The advantage of radio is we can give a longer message than we can squeeze on 
the message signs," said Greg Damico, a senior transportation engineer for 
Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately, we would like to develop a system so that computers that are 
sensing the flow of traffic can generate a digitized computer-voice message 
telling what the problem is." 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, for those Easterners who think that we call 'em freeways because 
they're free of tolls -- wrong, wrong, wrong! According to the California 
statutes, a freeway is simply a highway "to which the owners of abutting lands 
have no right or easement of access to or from their abutting lands. . . ."

 In the crisp chill of autumn, hundreds of thousands of Southern Californians 
ushered in the holiday season with marching bands, poetry-reading brides and 
even a few impassioned doses of politics Sunday at three annual parades held in 
the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hollywood, celebrity and glitz marked the night at the city's 63rd annual 
Christmas Parade. In Pasadena, irreverence was the rule at the Doo Dah Parade, 
a two-decade-old ritual that was reconfigured this year after a wave of bad 
reviews. And on the Eastside, a decidedly Latino flavor characterized the 20th 
annual East L.A. Christmas Fantasy Parade. 
</P>
<P>
 For thousands, the parades set off a headlong rush into the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the beginning of Christmas as far as I'm concerned," a beaming Louis 
Gossett Jr., grand marshal of the Hollywood parade, told reporters before 
heading out with his son and a bodyguard in a 1956 Buick convertible. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with some three-quarters of a million people lining Hollywood streets, 
not everyone could be there, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Zsa Zsa Gabor said she wanted to ride in the parade on her show horse, Silver 
Fox, but the horse -- and Zsa Zsa, for that matter -- just weren't up to the 
trek. "The poor thing was tired, and I just got back from Europe, dah-ling," 
Gabor explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Zsa Zsa had to settle for being driven along the route in a 1935 Auburn 
boat-tail speedster -- not her notorious Rolls Royce from a cop-slapping 
traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
 By evening, temperatures in Hollywood had dipped into the low 50s. But police 
estimated that more than 750,000 people -- a possible record for the event, 
organizers said -- braved the windy chill to see more than four dozen floats 
and vintage cars, carrying a cavalcade of actors, athletes and celebrities, 
make their way west along Sunset to Highland, up to Hollywood Boulevard, and 
then, east again, 3.2 miles in all. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Illingston of Los Angeles, who bundled her three children in scarves, 
gloves and hats for the event, said she hasn't missed a Hollywood parade in 
five years. "Too cold? Never, not for this. I would never miss this parade . . 
. even if it were snowing." 
</P>
<P>
 "I really like this parade," said Olympic gold medalist boxer Oscar de la 
Hoya, riding in a radio station's van and waving to fans, "because most of all, 
kids from all over come to see it. That's a good feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Eastside and Pasadena events, opponents of Proposition 187 who were 
part of the parade took time out from the festivities to call for unity in the 
wake of passage of the state ballot measure that would deny many public 
services to illegal immigrants. The measure, approved overwhelmingly by voters 
earlier this month, is now being contested in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of work to do. We will continue the fight," Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Gloria Molina said at the Eastside parade. "We are all going to move 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eastside event sought to offered a bit of culture for everyone -- from 
traditional floats and drill teams to Aztec dancers and stars from 
Spanish-language "telenovelas, " or soap operas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and a happy New Year," said Rep. 
Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles), decked out in a bright red blazer as she 
waved to the crowd from a 1950s-era classic sky-blue Thunderbird convertible. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an azure sky, the throngs lined the sidewalks in rows up to five people 
deep as the procession moved down Whittier Boulevard through the heart of the 
East Los Angeles commercial district. 
</P>
<P>
 Children held colorful balloons and toddlers perched on their fathers' 
shoulders to catch a glimpse of the passing show. Street vendors did a lively 
business hawking everything from ice cream to pupusas , a Salvadoran turnover. 
</P>
<P>
 About 157,000 people flocked to the 1.5-mile parade route, according to Los 
Angeles County sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything went really nice. The weather was beautiful, and the crowds were 
really enjoying the parade," said Lt. Lynda Castro of the East Los Angeles 
sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
 The bands, floats and drill teams came from areas ranging from Wilmington in 
the Los Angeles Harbor area to Rubidoux in Riverside County. Participants 
included the Brooklyn Elementary School drill team, the Banning High School 
Band and the U.S. Vietnam Veterans of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pasadena, meanwhile, the Doo Dah Parade returned to Colorado Boulevard on 
Sunday as a scaled-down but still irreverent celebration of wackiness. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The latest version was more like its early years, before the bizarre spoof of 
the annual Rose Parade became an institution itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The shortened Doo Dah included such entries as the BBQ and Hibachi Grill Team, 
a group of marching human billiard balls and a flock of fluttering brides 
reciting poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade began in 1978 as a sendup of the city's stately Tournament of 
Roses, mimicked by one group of Doo Dah participants as the "Torment of Roses." 
The annual spoof proved popular, but that in turn brought crowd-control 
headaches, especially after onlookers started a tradition of tossing tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, organizers tried to cut down on the rowdiness by charging a $10 
admission fee and enclosing the parade in a gated area around City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 But that brought small crowds and complaints that the spoof had lost its 
spunk, so organizers on Sunday returned the event to Old Pasadena and once 
again made it free to the public. Hoping to add more of a family atmosphere, 
they also threw out some of the more risque elements -- like a display of 
pregnant nuns and a Macho Dog exposing himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by attendance, the changes may have worked. Pasadena police estimated 
the crowd at up to 20,000 people -- a tenfold increase over last year.

L.A. SCENE THE CITY THEN AND NOW 
</P>

<P>
 She was one of Los Angeles' more colorful judges, performing marriage 
ceremonies on Saturdays outside the locked courthouse, and dramatizing her 
points by such tactics as destroying evidence -- burning a Nazi flag on the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
 And her appointed successor decorated her chambers in pink, wore miniskirts 
and kept a pet Chihuahua at her feet as she sat in judgment on accused 
wrongdoers. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when women judges were virtually nonexistent, these two filled the 
spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Depression to the Space Age, Municipal Judge Ida May Adams -- the 
third woman elected to the Los Angeles municipal bench -- was a tiny, familiar 
figure whose personality, if not her stature, filled the oversize black robe 
she wore in civil and criminal courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Adams ended her controversial career in 1962, she had become legendary 
for conducting marriages on the courthouse steps -- and perhaps for collecting 
big fees from the happy couples. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As an attorney, she had a reputation for outspokenness. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending a client accused of disturbing the peace, Adams, a 1920 USC Law 
School graduate, was admonished by a judge who shook his finger at her, saying: 
"Don't get excited, young lady, I know something of the facts in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the judge found her in contempt of court moments later, Adams retorted: 
"Courts are supposed to base their actions on evidence, and not on what facts 
they may know themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 After she was elected judge in 1931, Adams was repeatedly in the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days of Prohibition, she battled the parole board, the sheriff and the 
district attorney, accusing them of "working diametrically opposite to the 
judiciary" for granting early parole to a bootlegger she had sent to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gentlemen, he was a fugitive from justice with a trunkload of gin bottles. 
May I ask how the people of Los Angeles County can expect the judiciary to 
enforce the law if its district attorney and sheriff are working against me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her outspokenness -- or perhaps because of it -- 36 fellow judges 
endorsed her for reelection in 1937. Many others believed it was inappropriate, 
though not illegal, for a judge to endorse a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Bar Assn. began to interview the 36 judges. One said he 
supported Adams because she had not run against him as she had threatened. 
Another said he didn't have the heart to refuse after she "burst into a fit of 
weeping." And yet another judge said, "She is a judge, and judges should stick 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 But not all judges agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 They objected to Adams often spending more time defending herself than she 
spent on the bench. And some opposed her for not paying a $40 advertising bill, 
for being delinquent on a $126 department store account and $37 worth of law 
books -- not to mention receiving several traffic tickets and being involved in 
a few accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 She still was reelected. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1941, shortly before the country entered World War II, Adams began a war of 
her own, burning a small Nazi flag that was evidence against an American 
sailor. The sailor admitted stabbing a woman he had met in a bar after becoming 
"infuriated" at the sight of the Nazi flag in her apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 From the bench, Adams grabbed the flag and put a match to it, saying, "I think 
this emblem should be burned up before it might cause some more serious 
crimes."  
</P>
<P>
 The Germans protested and the governor ordered an investigation, but Adams 
declared that she had no apologies to make. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy returned in 1958, when she became a target of a state legislative 
committee trying to determine whether marriage ceremonies were interfering with 
judges' trial work. Their solution: close the courthouse on weekends, 
ostensibly for economic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 For one year, Adams defied the rules and continued performing marriages, but 
on the steps outside the locked building. 
</P>
<P>
 But the committee had more serious concerns. The report found that Adams was 
receiving about $10,000 a year in marriage fees, and even paid elevator 
operators and other county employees to direct couples to her courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she gave the gratuities to a school she had opened for retarded 
children. As a result of the investigation, a 1959 law made it a misdemeanor 
for a judge to perform a marriage for a fee or any other compensation on 
weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she continued to preside with wit and humor. When the U.S. Supreme 
Court outlawed prayers in New York schools in 1962, Adams announced that she 
always opened court with a prayer and intended to continue. She then bowed her 
head and said, "God bless the Supreme Court and let it be shown the error of 
its way." 
</P>
<P>
 She retired that year, three months before the end of her fifth term, and she 
died in 1965 at the age of 79. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams' successor proved to be a match for her: Noel Cannon, whom the 
California Supreme Court removed from the municipal bench after 12 years of 
bizarre behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Cannon, a graduate of Stanford University and its law school, ordered the 
incarceration of defense attorneys who made her angry, gave a demonstration of 
weapons women could carry to protect themselves, and threatened to give a 
police officer a ".38-caliber vasectomy" after he stopped her for excessively 
honking her horn in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 When the officer appeared in court, she greeted him with, "You've been a very 
naughty boy," and sent him on his way with some religious pamphlets.

'SANTA': ALLEN'S HOLIDAY COMEDY STILL FLYING HIGH; THANKSGIVING IS NO TURKEY 
FOR DISNEY'S 'SANTA'; BOX OFFICE: THE FAMILY HIT IS LEADING THE PACK WITH AN 
ESTIMATED $27.5 MILLION OVER THE NEAR-RECORD HOLIDAY, FOLLOWED BY 'STAR TREK' 
AND 'INTERVIEW.' SCHWARZENEGGER'S 'JUNIOR' PLACES FOURTH.

 Comedian Tim Allen gobbled up a new generation of "Star Trek" as well as the 
likes of Tom Cruise and Arnold Schwarzenegger over the weekend. The TV star's 
Yuletide-cheery "The Santa Clause" led the pack over a near-record Thanksgiving 
weekend with an estimated $27.5 million for the five-day holiday, followed by 
"Star Trek: Generations" (a projected $20.6 million), "Interview With the 
Vampire" ($17 million) and Schwarzenegger's "Junior" ($14 million). 
</P>
<P>
 The urban shamus film "A Low Down Dirty Shame" also got off to a good start 
with $11.4 million in five days, but Macaulay Culkin wasn't enough of a lure 
for audiences to sample the largely animated "The Pagemaster," which took in 
only $5.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thanksgiving record of about $140 million, set in 1992, is still safe, 
according to John Krier of Exhibitor Relations. But with nearly $135 million 
estimated for the five days ending Sunday, this year's holiday was no turkey 
and will finish well ahead of last year's rather scrappy $107 million. More 
important for the movie industry, the strength of current business virtually 
guarantees that 1994 will be the best year yet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The Santa Clause," Allen's runaway hit for Disney, is the clear family 
favorite with $27.5 million on 2,269 screens -- more than $12,000 a theater. 
Its three-week take of $72 million to $73 million surpasses the film's budget 
and marketing costs combined, meaning there'll be no coal in Disney executives' 
year-end bonus envelopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Studio distribution chief Richard Cook said the movie could overtake its 
family division's current leader, "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," which did more 
than $130 million. He also boasted that the studio's three current releases 
accounted for 40% of the business of the top 10 films: "A Low Down Dirty Shame" 
starring another TV personality, Keenen Ivory Wayans, ranked fifth in its debut 
with $11.4 million on 1,379 screens; and right behind, "The Lion King" 
continued to bellow with $8.1 million on 1,516 screens and $282 million so far. 
(It's now only $12-million shy of "Forrest Gump," the biggest grosser of 1994, 
with $294 million. "Forrest" bench-pressed almost $2 million over 
Thanksgiving.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Star Trek: Generations" slipped into second gear but with plenty of fuel to 
spare. The holiday brought an additional $20.6 million on 2,681 screens. In 10 
days, "Trek" has tallied $50.5 million, reviving the hearty franchise. At this 
rate, the seventh "Trek" has a shot at $100 million, which would make it only 
the second of the series to reach that plateau. ("Trek IV" took in almost $110 
million.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Interview," while impressive, is somewhat hampered by its high-gore content; 
small-town America isn't responding. But big cities, with larger theaters and 
better overall attendance, are carrying the film to a reported $17 million in 
its third weekend. Next week begins the normal seasonal slump, and though 
"Interview" has already copped about $83 million, the general consensus is that 
it won't reach the $150 million-or-so level of Cruise's last two movies, "The 
Firm" and "A Few Good Men."  
</P>
<P>
 The pregnant-with-possibility comedy "Junior" had been tagged as one of the 
season's sure-fire hits by industry insiders, thanks to the re-teaming of 
"Twins" co-stars Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito. But audiences, particularly 
males, would rather see Schwarzenegger terminate than germinate. "There was 
some resistance, but that's why we did sneak previews last weekend," says Tom 
Pollock, chairman of Universal Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the help of a firestorm of advertising, initial indifference was 
overcome. In its first five days, "Junior" appeared moderately fecund with $14 
million on 1,749 screens. And Pollock is now talking best-case scenario, that 
"Junior" follows in the footsteps of other Schwarzenegger comedies, such as 
"Kindergarten Cop" and "Twins," both of which started slow and developed into 
substantial grossers. 
</P>
<P>
 MGM/UA got a holiday boost from the seventh-ranked "Stargate," which deposited 
another $6.4 million toward its $60 million to date. 
</P>
<P>
 But 20th Century Fox is crying bah-humbug -- and with good reason: Disney 
scrooged away most of the family audience with "Santa" and "Lion," leaving 
"Pagemaster" with a meager $5.5-million debut on 1,803 screens and "Miracle on 
34th Street" without hope, with $5.2 million on 1,191 screens despite its 
money-back guarantee to moviegoers. 
</P>
<P>
 In between the two Fox films, in ninth place, "The Professional" did as much 
business over the past five days as it did in its first three, $5.3 million.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: TELEVISION; CAN ABC'S NOBLE EFFORTS GIVE ANY LIFE TO 'LIFE'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's refreshing to see ABC buck tradition and extend the season of one of 
prime time's least popular series. Rarely has a network been so high on a 
series so low. 
</P>
<P>
 The beneficiary here is "My So-Called Life," a weekly drama tracking the bumps 
and grinds of a fitful, moody, self-conscious, self-obsessed -- in other words, 
quite typical -- 15-year-old, an inside-out account of middle-class adolescence 
presented mostly from her own perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "My So-Called Life" is capable of greatness. Its recent Halloween-fantasy 
episode was one of the season's highlights. And Thursday's episode appealingly 
finds the virginal Angela (Claire Danes) trying to hold back a libido landslide 
when her clunky boyfriend pressures her to "do it" with him. Although praised 
by many critics as one of the best and most original and distinctive series in 
prime time -- and blessed with TV's best teen-age actress -- "My So-Called 
Life" has endeared itself to relatively few viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Its so-called ratings since its fall debut? As one of its teen-age characters 
might say with a grimace: Ooooh!  
</P>
<P>
 Of 103 prime-time shows measured by the A.C. Nielsen Co., "My So-Called Life" 
is a tiny blip, ranking a barely visible 95th for the season. Assuming the 
unaccustomed role of lenient parent, however, ABC recently ordered four 
additional episodes of the series for a total of 19, just three shy of a full 
season. What's going on here? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This network act of faith in the face of withering commercial failure is not 
unprecedented. NBC renewed the famed "St. Elsewhere" after an opening 1982-83 
season in which it ranked 86th out of 98 shows, for example. Although never a 
true hit, it endured five additional seasons, joining the great "Hill Street 
Blues" (another lethargic starter) in heaping prestige upon NBC when it most 
needed it. And this season brought Fox's surprising full-season embrace of 
"M.A.N.T.I.S.," a first-year series presently ranked last in prime-time 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fox denies it, pressure from the Rev. Jesse Jackson and other black 
activists may have persuaded it to tighten its hug on "M.A.N.T.I.S.," a series 
whose superhero is African American. "St. Elsewhere" had on its side NBC 
Chairman Grant Tinker, an executive known for exercising patience with 
low-rated shows, and the kind of upscale demographics especially prized by 
advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the core audience of the Winnie Holzman-created "My 
So-Called Life" is essentially adolescent. Nor does today's ABC have a 
reputation for tolerantly sparing low-performing series, as did Tinker's NBC. 
Plus no one, aside from some of its own sparse audience, perhaps, has intensely 
lobbied the network to extend "My So-Called Life," whose executive producers, 
Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, also created the memorable 
"thirtysomething," an ABC series whose own so-so audience totals were balanced 
by gleaming demographics. 
</P>
<P>
 Zwick agrees that ABC's support of "My So-Called Life" has been 
"extraordinary" in light of its ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Is it really possible that ABC -- one of those vast, cold, faceless corporate 
edifices that determines the fates of programs and careers based solely on a 
fiscal bottom line -- is thinking with its heart instead of its head when it 
comes to "My So-Called Life?" 
</P>
<P>
 "We really love it," said Stuart Bloomberg, whose job as executive vice 
president, ABC Entertainment, puts him in charge of the network's program 
development. "For me, the prospect of not being a part of these characters' 
lives on a weekly basis is something that I don't look forward to. There is 
such a small handful of drama producers whose series constantly excite you and 
keep you off balance. These people (the "My So-Called Life" team members) don't 
write with a safety net."  
</P>
<P>
 Yet networks do program with safety nets. "I guess one thing is that our 
schedule is doing OK in most areas," said Bloomberg, "so we have been able to 
keep this on, even though it doesn't do too well. It could reach a point where 
we can't, but we want to stretch that line." 
</P>
<P>
 Although "My So-Called Life" may not be everyone's taste, the depth of its 
ratings abyss seems almost inexplicable given its overall quality. Why is it 
unable to attract many viewers? 
</P>
<P>
 * Theory 1: The series is a victim of its own accurate reading of youth, at 
times creating such a painful mirror-image of adolescence that many present and 
former parents of teen-agers can't bear revisiting the discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want (the producers) to show some of the highs as well as the lows," 
Bloomberg said. "They are finally adding some joy. There's a ray of sunshine in 
Angela's life, and we are encouraging more of that." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Zwick said the producers received "no directive" from ABC to lighten 
the series. "If things seem lighter now, maybe that's coincidental." 
</P>
<P>
 * Theory 2: Some believe that there's room on the networks for only one 
"smart" show per evening, and on Thursdays, NBC has that slot nailed down with 
its 8 p.m. hit comedy, "Mad About You." On the other hand, you could argue that 
"Friends" and "Seinfeld," the two NBC comedies that directly follow "Mad About 
You," are "smart" shows too. 
</P>
<P>
 * Theory 3: "My So-Called Life" is too ill-suited to its 8 p.m. time slot to 
ever draw much of an audience at that hour. When ABC tested a rerun of the show 
at 10 p.m. earlier in the season, its ratings rose dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomberg acknowledges that 8 p.m. is not ideal for the oft-sophisticated 
storytelling of "My So-Called Life," and Zwick agrees. ABC "understood going in 
just how difficult the time slot will be," Zwick said. "But they didn't have a 
10 o'clock or 9 o'clock time slot to give it. When 'thirtysomething' first came 
on, ABC had a much less strong schedule, and therefore the ability to put us 
anyplace where we would be best served." 
</P>
<P>
 Just where "My So-Called Life" is best served, or whether it will be served at 
all, remains to be seen. "I don't think we are going to run past January," 
predicted Zwick, who believes that ABC at that point will banish the series to 
limboland -- better known as "hiatus" -- and not make a decision on its fate 
for next season until May, when it will know the new time slots it will have 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a series as good as "My So-Called Life" merits more than just a faint 
hope, given its ratings, it's fortunate to have any hope at all.

 "Northern Exposure" has always been the story of a fish out of water. 
</P>
<P>
 For five hit seasons on CBS, the eccentricities of Cicely, Alaska, have been 
refracted through the eyes of Joel Fleischman, a confirmed New Yorker 
reluctantly stuck in the isolated Alaskan town to repay the state for his 
medical scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Morrow, the actor who plays Fleischman, was similarly bound to his TV 
contract. But over the summer he successfully fought to get out in order to 
pursue film roles. When last seen two weeks ago, Fleischman had abandoned his 
obsessive ways and moved up river to hang loose with natives in a primitive 
village. 
</P>
<P>
 So what do you do when the fish gets away? 
</P>
<P>
 You haul out a couple more from the drink. In tonight's episode, comedian Paul 
Provenza and actress Teri Polo are introduced as Dr. Phillip Capra and his 
wife, Michelle, an urban couple who are sick of city life. Capra gives up his 
flourishing practice in Los Angeles to search for paradise lost on the frozen 
tundra. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than lament the departure of Morrow, the producers and cast of 
"Northern Exposure" seem downright effusive over the rare opportunity in 
episodic television to change course. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ironically, now that Rob's leaving, it's helped the show," said Janine 
Turner, who plays Maggie O'Connell, Fleischman's off-and-on-again romantic 
interest. "Before, the show almost seemed to be written episode to episode. 
This year, they're having to give some thought to character arcs, and they had 
to really think about how to get Fleischman off the show. So the scripts are 
more zany and exciting and full of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleischman isn't gone yet. The character will appear in every episode of the 
series until his final farewell during the February ratings sweeps. For the 
next several weeks, he will remain in the small fishing village as different 
characters take pilgrimages to visit him and say goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trouble with television is that characters can't change and don't 
change," said executive producer David Chase. "This is a good opportunity for 
us to have Joel change, so all this hasn't been for nothing. And in the same 
way, the show can possibly change." 
</P>
<P>
 "Northern Exposure," while still quite successful, could nonetheless use a 
slight transfusion. Its ratings are down about 11% this season, and fans have 
been complaining for more than a year that the characters have stopped 
developing. The writing had its moments, many said, but the episodes became 
darker and moodier, with less of the eclectic music that was the show's 
trademark (two record albums have been released with songs used on the series). 
</P>
<P>
 "They still pull an ace out of their hat on occasion. But those occasions are 
getting further and further apart," one fan, Gerry Ashley, wrote on a "Northern 
Exposure" computer bulletin board recently. "This is precisely why I feel that 
the end of the Joel and Maggie plot line (as sad as it is for some of us) 
offers a chance for the show's rebirth. Sure it won't be the same show. But the 
way it's been lately, that's good news." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, O'Connell was mostly a counterpoint to Fleischman, as well as a 
periodic romantic entanglement. With Morrow leaving the show, the producers 
finally had a chance this season to bring them together -- they got engaged -- 
only to realize they were simply too different to cohabitate. O'Connell's 
spurning of Fleischman sent him off on his journey of self-discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have an episode with him right out of 'Heart of Darkness,' where I travel 
the river to find him and have an encounter with him that is really profound on 
me," said Provenza, who was last seen hosting "Comics Only" on Comedy Central. 
"His departure is really integral to the show -- not just serviceable." 
</P>
<P>
 In Morrow's wake, Turner lobbied the producers, the studio and the network for 
a return to her old, quirky, headstrong character, and she got it. (One fan on 
the Prodigy computer service referred to the character of the last few seasons 
as "Maggie Lite.") 
</P>
<P>
 In coming weeks, O'Connell will become mayor of the town and a major player to 
rival Maurice, thanks to a financial inheritance she receives. There are also 
plans for a romance with the philosophical deejay Chris Stevens, played by John 
Corbett, who grows suddenly attracted to her upon seeing a gavel in her hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner said she now feels "refreshed and inspired" going to work, compared 
with last season when she felt "repressed and trapped." In the past, most of 
Turner's scenes were with Morrow, who reportedly gained a difficult reputation 
on the set. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before this, I haven't had much of a chance to work with (Corbett)," Turner 
said. "I've never had more fun on the set. It's kind of like getting out of a 
bad marriage -- you don't know how good it can be till you leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner was angry at first when she learned Morrow was quitting without having 
told her. He is in negotiations to play a public defender representing Sharon 
Stone on Death Row in "The Last Dance," to be directed by Bruce Beresford. Like 
Morrow, who has been fielding film offers since appearing in director Robert 
Redford's "Quiz Show," Turner became a movie commodity after starring opposite 
Sylvester Stallone in "Cliffhanger." But, out of loyalty, she decided to remain 
with the series until her contract runs out after next season, provided her 
role was beefed up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the town of Cicely will now be treated by a new doctor, whose 
wife is a travel writer for in-flight magazines. The producers regularly 
explored Fleischman's Jewishness; now they will delve into Capra's Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
 And, while the characters of "Northern Exposure" are no longer fresh to 
viewers, they will be fresh to the two newcomers, who can provide perspective 
and commentary, the producers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning, the audience was oblivious to the town of Cicely, and Rob's 
character was a sort of liaison, going into this world we don't know," Provenza 
said. "Now everyone knows the world so well, and my character is the one who is 
discovering it. The audience is in on it more than my character, so they're 
watching my reactions to what they have grown to know and love. The reason my 
character needs a wife is because there's nobody else for me to connect with 
and share my thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
 These fish differ from the earlier one in another significant way. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to be in Cicely," executive producer Diane Frolov said. But, in 
other respects, she added, it's still "Northern Exposure": "Joel was our eyes, 
and basically these new characters will fulfill that function. The fish out of 
water is still the premise of the show." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Northern Exposure" airs Mondays at 10 p.m. on CBS (Channels 2 and 8).

CALL THE COPS MAKES HOLLYWOOD LOOK REAL; MOVIES: THE COMPANY FORMED BY THREE 
LAPD MEMBERS CONSULTS WITH FILMMAKERS SO THAT POLICE WORK WILL APPEAR 
AUTHENTIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM CUNNEFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sitting in a Studio City coffee shop, LAPD SWAT officer Randy Walker holds a 
still from this summer's smash movie "Speed," showing Keanu Reeves' character 
being honored for his police heroics. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one has ever looked more real getting the Medal of Valor," Walker says 
proudly. "From the actual medal and the stripes on his uniform to his badge, 
ribbons and buttons, when they look like that, we've done our job." 
</P>
<P>
 His other job, he means. When he isn't storming barricaded armed suspects or 
rescuing hostages, Walker moonlights (or daylights, depending on his shift) as 
a technical adviser to Hollywood. He calls his side business, which also 
includes his former SWAT partner Ed Arneson and Ed's brother Mark, Call the 
Cops, appropriately enough, and that's exactly what the makers of "Speed" -- 
and a host of other films and TV shows -- have done to make their works as 
authentic as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keanu in particular relied on them," says executive producer and production 
manager Ian Bryce. "For the medal scene, he really wanted to know how he should 
move, so he and Randy discussed how it should be done with military precision." 
</P>
<P>
 When the little details are real, audiences are much more likely to buy action 
scenes and plot lines that strain credulity. In addition to looking over 
scripts for correct dialogue and terminology, the threesome also advise 
production designers and prop masters and train the actors in the use of 
firearms and police tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, they showed Reeves and co-star Jeff Daniels the proper "low 
ready" position for carrying MP-5 assault weapons (angled toward the ground 
with the trigger finger along the frame) and how to enter a room with a handgun 
(the gun always moves in sync with the eyes). 
</P>
<P>
 "They worked us pretty good on how to actually do what cops would do," Daniels 
says, noting how every tactic, even the simple act of going around a corner, is 
based on safety and caution. "They take a lot of the gung-ho hero stuff -- 
bursting into a room and 75 bad guys open fire and the hero's still standing -- 
right out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Most mistakes occur, they say, when the filmmakers rely on cliches gleaned 
from TV. Just as there are no doughnuts on the table in front of Walker and Ed 
Arneson (Mark Arneson is on the set of their latest movie, James Cameron's 
"Strange Days," which is due out next year), real cops would never hold a gun 
up by their face. "We call that the 'Cagney & Lacey' stance," says Walker, 46, 
a Jeff Daniels look-alike with a thick build and a deep voice. 
</P>
<P>
 And they would never have sampled narcotics as Wesley Snipes did in "Rising 
Sun." Even though they consulted on portions of the script, they were never 
shown a scene in which Snipes does a taste test of some dope. "That's something 
they did in films 25 years ago," scoffs Arneson, 45, furrowing the considerable 
crows feet that have built up around his friendly eyes after 20 years of sizing 
up suspicious types. "Would you do that? I wouldn't know what cocaine or heroin 
tastes like." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The filmmakers, they suggest, should have used a much more visually 
interesting -- and realistic -- drug-testing device called a Narcoband kit, 
which changes colors with a hit and a shake. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not to say that Walker and the Arnesons aren't flexible enough to 
allow a little artistic license. So that Reeves could be an all-encompassing 
hero, for example, they looked the other way when his character tried to defuse 
a bomb, which a SWAT officer would never do. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times what works in real life and is tactically correct doesn't work 
for them on film," Walker notes, chomping down into a burger. Adds Arneson, in 
between bites of ham and eggs: "Directors have certain things in their mind 
they want to show on camera." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker was inspired to create Call the Cops in 1988 after a producer and 
writer came to visit the SWAT unit one day. He recruited his partner Ed 
Arneson, and Ed's brother Mark, a South-Central homicide detective, joined them 
in 1992. Not long after mailing out 2,000 flyers, they were hired for a TV 
pilot called "Protect and Surf." Director Richard Benjamin then used them on 
his 1990 buddy-cop film, "Downtown." They've since advised on eight other 
movies, including "Point Break," "Terminator II" and "Point of No Return." 
</P>
<P>
 It beats security work, they agree. "It's a way to make extra money in a way 
that's not another threatening experience for us," says Ed Arneson, who 
obviously doesn't know Hollywood yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they have the LAPD's permission for their off-duty work, there are 
some tactics they won't reveal, such as hostage negotiation strategy. "That's a 
mind thing," Arneson says. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a situation they know all too well. Both men were awarded the Medal of 
Valor for rescuing two female hostages after a 14-hour ordeal at a mid-Wilshire 
District medical center in August, 1983. They are reluctant to give too many of 
the details because they are turning it into a screenplay, but each saved one 
of the hostages while the gunman was simultaneously shot to death by two other 
SWAT officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a true-life Dennis Hopper," says Walker, referring to the villain in 
"Speed." "He was an intelligent bad guy who knew the tactics of the police." 
</P>
<P>
 While that was one of their proudest moments in the line of duty, their most 
satisfying Hollywood experience has been "Speed," not surprisingly. 
(Ironically, they get the same amount of money for both -- $30 an hour.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the portrayal of police officers was positive, and that was kind of 
nice," says Walker, who says he is one of only three L.A. SWAT officers to have 
been wounded in action since the unit's current inception in 1972. "They looked 
good, they had haircuts. Sometimes that drives us nuts. There are extras on a 
set in police uniforms and they have shoulder-length hair. And we're like, 
'Wait a minute. . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
 For Daniels, the ultimate test of Call the Cops' advice came when a couple of 
SWAT officers he knows back home in Michigan saw his performance. "I didn't 
want them to go, 'Huh, that was cute. That's not what happens when I get to 
work at midnight,' " says the appropriately coiffed actor. "They said, 'Yeah, 
you did it right.' "

SCR GETS SURPRISE GIFT FOR SOLIS' 'POSADA'; STAGE: LILA WALLACE-READER'S DIGEST 
FUND WILL AWARD $80,000 TO HELP FINANCE 'LA POSADA MAGICA' PREMIERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "La Posada Magica," a Latino Christmas play to open next month at South Coast 
Repertory, has been awarded $80,000 by the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund to 
help finance the world premiere, theater officials announced last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Written by Octavio Solis, with a score by Marcos Loya, "La Posada Magica" 
tells the story of a teen-age girl who no longer feels the Christmas spirit but 
who finds a surprising renewal of hope. The play is loosely based on the Latin 
American tradition of the posada , a neighborhood procession to commemorate 
Mary and Joseph's search for an inn on the night she gives birth. 
</P>
<P>
 The windfall comes on top of an earlier $40,000 grant from the fund. That 
money was used to underwrite commissions for the script, the original music and 
development of the material supervised by Jose Cruz Gonzalez, head of SCR's 
Hispanic Playwrights Program, who will be directing the play on the troupe's 
Second Stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The latest grant is a great boon," Solis said upon learning of the award. "We 
would have had only two weeks of rehearsal without it, and frankly I wouldn't 
have been able to do what needs to be done. More time has freed up greater 
avenues for creativity. We've only been in rehearsals a week, and I'm already 
making a tremendous amount of revisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Solis, 36, a playwright based in San Francisco, has had two plays developed 
through the Hispanic program: "Man of the Flesh," which received its 1990 
premiere on the SCR Second Stage (mounted since then in Dallas, Chicago, San 
Francisco and San Diego), and "La Illuminada," which SCR commissioned but did 
not produce. His "Scrappers" has toured secondary schools in Orange County as 
part of SCR's community outreach program. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Solis will direct another of his plays, "El Paso Blue," at San 
Diego Repertory. And in April, the Dallas Theatre Center will produce his 
"Santos & Santos," which recently won an incentive grant from the Kennedy 
Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'La Posada Magica' requires a childlike imagination to buy into it," Solis 
said. "There's something at work, a kind of magic, that takes us all by 
surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the religious imagery, he said, he has aimed for a secular tone. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a play for people who feel they've been left behind by Christmas . . 
." he said. "There's such pressure at this time of year to be joyous, it's not 
a healthy thing. Terrible things still happen. Some families don't get along. 
Some people are lonely. Some don't have the money to buy presents. This is a 
play for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Loya, a Los Angeles composer, has written 10 songs (with lyrics by Solis) for 
"La Posada Magica." He will perform them with guitarist Lorenzo Martinez and 
other members of the company. Loya's music combines Latin and jazz influences 
and has been featured in various films, including "Stand and Deliver," "The 
Waterdance" and "Born in East L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 The production will be designed by Cliff Faulkner (scenery), Shigeru Yaji 
(costumes) and Lonnie Rafael Alcaraz (lighting). 
</P>
<P>
 * "La Posada Magica" previews begin Dec. 9 on the South Coast Repertory Second 
Stage, 655 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. The regular run is Dec. 14 - 24. $14 
(Dec. 9-11); $15-$19 (Dec. 13-18); $18-$22 (Dec. 20-24). (714) 957-4033.

MONTANA GOES OUT, AND CHIEFS GO DOWN; AFC: QUARTERBACK REACHES 40,000-YARD MARK 
BUT IS INJURED DURING 10-9 LOSS TO SEAHAWKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After Joe Montana left the field with a foot injury, almost everything went 
wrong for the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 And things could get worse if Montana's injury turns out to be serious. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seattle Seahawks scored 10 points in the fourth quarter Sunday to defeat 
Kansas City, 10-9, dropping the Chiefs two games behind San Diego in the AFC 
West. 
</P>
<P>
 The lone positive for Montana and the Chiefs was that, with 163 yards passing, 
the 38-year-old quarterback surpassed 40,000 career yards, only the fifth NFL 
quarterback to do so. The others are Fran Tarkenton, Dan Marino, Dan Fouts and 
Johnny Unitas. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, the Chiefs were tight-lipped about the seriousness of 
Montana's injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you anything at this time," Coach Marty Schottenheimer said 
before boarding a bus to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana didn't make himself available to the media, and the Chiefs' public 
relations director, Bob Moore, did not get off the bus to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs (7-5) initially said Montana had a sprained left foot, but that was 
before X-rays were taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana apparently was injured with about six minutes gone in the third 
quarter when he threw an incomplete pass on a third-and-11 play. He was hit by 
three defenders and fell hard to the AstroTurf. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana came back out the next time the Chiefs had the ball and ran one play 
-- a handoff. After Steve Bono replaced him with 5:04 left in the quarter, the 
Chiefs' trainers looked at Montana's foot and sent him to the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle's winning points came on John Kasay's 32-yard field goal with 1:42 to 
play, giving the Seahawks their second consecutive come-from-behind victory 
after six losses in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Chiefs' lasts possession, Lake Dawson fumbled after catching a pass 
with 1:01 left, and Robert Blackmon recovered and returned it 17 yards to the 
Kansas City 15. Rolling Up the Yardage 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Montana surpassed the 40,000 yard passing mark Sunday. The Top 10 all 
time: 03,16,18,08 Player Team Yards Fran Tarkenton Minn.-NYG 47,003 *Dan Marino
