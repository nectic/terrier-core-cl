 COLD WAR RELIC: The folks at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library are 
expecting a hot shipment today -- a nuclear missile. . . . Once deployed in 
Europe in 1983 during Reagan's defense buildup, the ground-based cruise missile 
was removed after Reagan signed the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 
1988 with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. . . . The 22-foot-long missile will 
become part of the library's permanent exhibit. Said spokeswoman Linda Schuler: 
"It has been stripped of its warhead, obviously, and has had its guidance 
systems removed." 
</P>
<P>
 DUAL ROLE: Usually, it's not hard to pick sides in a lawsuit when you're named 
as a defendant. But county supervisors find themselves supporting those who are 
suing them. . . . In a case that resumes today in Superior Court, the 
supervisors are being sued by Ojai and Ventura to knock the Weldon Canyon 
landfill initiative off the November ballot. A majority of supervisors put the 
measure on the ballot to force such a lawsuit. In court papers, they side with 
their opponents, calling the initiative "a fraud on the voters." 
</P>
<P>
 ALL ABOARD: Fillmore leaders hope to ride the rails to prosperity. . . . The 
Fillmore Chamber of Commerce sponsored a dinner train ride Saturday night that 
town leaders want to repeat as a weekly event for tourists with deep pockets 
(B1). . . . During its short but romantic route, the Short Line Railway stopped 
for a dinner dance at picnic tables and a wooden dance floor assembled in the 
middle of an orange grove. 
</P>
<P>
 COOL COUNSELOR: To Ventura city officials, Roberta Payan is a gang 
intervention specialist. But to the tough kids in west Ventura, she's someone 
they can talk to (B1). . . . "She grew up in the same place I did, so she knows 
what I'm growing up with," said 15-year-old Ulises Lopez. . . . As director of 
the Westpark Recreational Center, Payan is credited with transforming the 
sleepy recreational center into a bustling local hangout that keeps kids out of 
trouble.

MORNING BRIEFING: REACH OUT AND TOUCH TACKLE'S HAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Randall Cunningham, the often misunderstood Philadelphia Eagle quarterback, 
just wants a little togetherness. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Eagle offense bogged down in an exhibition game against the New York 
Jets, Cunningham was asked by Mark Eckel of the Trenton Times if the offense 
needed to be more unified. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you looked over at the Jets' huddle, you saw everyone holding hands," 
Cunningham said. "It's like a theme going out . . . it's like saying, 'Give me 
love. I need you there with me.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Herschel Walker says that in meetings sometimes. Then he came in the huddle 
and said, 'C'mon, I need a little love.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of us grabbed hands. But some guys didn't. That might be an indication 
that we're not there in terms of needing to be on the same page. If we all grab 
hands, that will show we're all together." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: The Boston Celtics recently acquired Pervis Ellison, who was 
taken No. 1 overall by the Sacramento Kings in the 1989 draft. Who was the last 
No. 1 overall pick to play for the Celtics? 
</P>
<P>
 Numbers game: Picking a uniform for New York Yankee players and coaches can be 
a little difficult, since 13 Yankee numbers have been retired, including No. 8 
for both Yogi Berra and Bill Dickey. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the Village Voice asked Manager Buck Showalter how he chose his No. 
11. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, they say that long thin numbers are slenderizing, so maybe that has 
something to do with it," Showalter said. "But you know Billy (Martin) wore No. 
1, and I certainly would never even think about asking for that, and 11 is 
about as close as I could get. Numbers are far and few between." 
</P>
<P>
 Plays of the weak: First, Mike Powell beat Carl Lewis to the world long jump 
record, breaking Bob Beamon's mark with a 29-foot, 4 1/2-inch leap in 1991 when 
everybody assumed that the man destined to smash the record was Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Powell is beating Lewis up verbally for pulling out of a recent showdown 
between the two best long jumpers in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carl should be out there jumping with me," Powell said at a news conference 
after winning the event at the Pan-African-USA track and field meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carl says his back is sore or, 'It's too cold today, so I won't jump.' That's 
not a champion. . . . He's the defending Olympic champion and he won't even 
compete against the best in the world. That's weak." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Bill Walton, who was the No. 1 overall pick out of UCLA in 1974 
and joined the Celtics 11 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: New England Patriot Coach Bill Parcells on his tendency to acquire 
large running backs and put them behind large offensive lines: "I believe in 
physical football. I'm not a finesse guy. If that makes me a Neanderthal, call 
me a Neanderthal." TIM KAWAKAMI

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That was quite an exhibition the Raiders put on Saturday night at Anaheim 
Stadium. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, they had all the comforts of home. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Go Raiders! Just Win, Baby" read the streamer behind a small plane flying 
above the stadium just before kickoff. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 They wore black jerseys. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 To make them feel even more at home, several fights broke out in the stands. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 The partisan crowd of 50,315 cheered them on to a 29-20 victory over the Rams. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 This probably will become commonplace for the lame ducks of Orange County -- a 
resounding defeat in front of a large percentage of spectators who are rooting 
for the visiting team. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's game was not as close as the score. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It was 20-3 at halftime before the reserves took over. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It should be noted, though, that the Raiders have become stronger in the 
backfield during the exhibition season when they've substituted Harvey Williams 
for Tyrone Montgomery at tailback and Tom Rathman for Napoleon McCallum at 
fullback. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Raider philosophy is not unlike that of a college team at the start of 
fall practice. The seniors are given the starting jobs automatically and the 
newcomers, no matter how talented, are told they will have to earn their way 
into the lineup. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 However, look for former San Francisco 49er Rathman to start against his old 
teammates in the opener Sept. 5 at Candlestick Park. Former Kansas City Chief 
Williams should be there too. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The salary cap has robbed most NFL teams of depth, but the Raiders are so deep 
at wide receiver that it is easy to forget that Rocket Ismail, who caught five 
passes against the Rams, does things besides return kickoffs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise this summer has been Daryl Hobbs, who led L.A. City quarterbacks 
with 26 touchdown passes his senior year at University High. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 After developing into a top wide receiver at Pacific, he spent 1992 on the 
Raiders' developmental squad and didn't make his NFL debut until the wild-card 
playoff victory over Denver last season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to worry about whether I was lining up right or running the right 
route," said Hobbs, who caught four against the Rams and dropped one."Now I 
feel comfortable." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 About the only Ram making things uncomfortable for Raider receivers was Toby 
Wright, the safety who was drafted out of Nebraska on the second round and is a 
devastating hitter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Sign of the times and the new rules: The Rams returned seven kickoffs for 176 
yards. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 With former Oregon Duck quarterback Chris Miller at the controls for the lame 
ducks, maybe their offense should be known as the quack attack. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I like the box in the upper left corner on Fox's telecasts that gives viewers 
the score and, more important, the time remaining in the quarter. It's small 
enough not to be a distraction. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The report from Miami is that Dan Marino's mobility isn't what it was before 
his Achilles' tendon surgery, but that his arm might be stronger than ever 
because of the rest. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Hate to say it, but Deion Sanders is worth all the fuss. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The only unbeaten teams in the NFL so far are Cleveland, Indianapolis, New 
England and Chicago. And the Bears play at Kansas City tonight. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Preseason state of Florida ratings: 1. Miami Dolphins. 2. Florida. 3. Florida 
State. 4. Miami Hurricanes. 5. Tampa Bay. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Reader Chuck DeBus of Santa Monica says that, according to his power ratings, 
the Golden State Warriors will have the best starting team in the NBA next 
season. He has the Orlando Magic and Phoenix Suns tied for second. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it about time that the Mighty Ducks signed Paul Kariya?. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 HBO made a great choice, George C. Scott, for the role of Cus D'Amato in the 
movie "Tyson" that will be shown next spring. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This could be the year that a 3-year-old, Holy Bull, wins the Eclipse Award 
for horse of the year despite finishing 12th in the Kentucky Derby and not 
participating in the Preakness, Belmont Stakes or Breeders' Cup. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Al Michaels, who used to broadcast San Francisco Giants games, believes Matt 
Williams would have broken the home run record this year because September is 
normally a productive month for right-handed power hitters at Candlestick Park. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 I'm surprised Barry Bonds didn't charge the judge for his autograph.

MOTOR RACING ROUNDUP; BODINE FIGHTS GRIEF, WINS MICHIGAN RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ernie Irvan was never very far from Geoff Bodine's thoughts Sunday as Bodine 
won the GM Goodwrench Dealers 400 at Brooklyn, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every lap I could see the wall over there in turn two, I would see those skid 
marks and Ernie came to mind," Bodine said of his critically injured NASCAR 
competitor. "It's hard (to race), but it's just something you have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 With Irvan on life support in an Ypsilanti hospital about 50 miles away after 
being injured in a crash during practice on Saturday, it was difficult for many 
of the drivers to concentrate before the 400-mile race at Michigan 
International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Jeff Burton, who was involved in an eight-car crash on the first lap, 
seemed almost relieved his racing day was over early, saying: "All of us out 
there are thinking about Ernie. I almost wish we didn't have to race today. 
What we went through out there isn't nearly as hard as what he's facing." 
</P>

 Al Unser Jr. led another high speed replay of Penske domination by winning the 
Slick 50 200 when teammate Emerson Fittipaldi lost a fuel gamble on the final 
laps at Loudon, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
 Fittipaldi led by more than 20 seconds but did not have enough fuel to finish 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
 He stayed on the track until the last minute, hoping for a caution flag. When 
it didn't come, he was forced to come in with five laps to go, coasting into 
the pits as the gas gauge went to zero. 
</P>
<P>
 Unser won by 0.89 seconds over another teammate, fast-closing Paul Tracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Fittipaldi, the pole-sitter, wound up third, 1.75 seconds back on the one-mile 
oval at the New Hampshire International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 Fittipaldi lost the lead in the 47th lap when he had to make an unscheduled 
stop for a blistered right tire. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was Unser's seventh in 12 races this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1-2-3 finish also was the fourth this season for the Penske team. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Australian Michael Doohan won the world championship motorcycle Grand Prix 
title in the 500cc category with his victory at Brno, Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Shinichi Itoh of Japan was second and Italian Luca Cadalore finished third. 
Cadalore had earned the pole position with the fastest practice time. 
</P>
<P>
 In winning the 118.668-kilometer race, Doohan continued his domination of the 
500cc competition this season. He has won eight of the last nine races. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Don Prudhomme scored his 48th career victory, winning the top fuel title at 
the Champion Auto Stores Nationals. It was his first victory at Brainerd 
(Minn.) International Raceway.

<P>
 John Force won the funny car title for his fifth consecutive victory and 
eighth of the season. Jim Yates won the pro stock competition for his first 
career victory.

 Ron Hornaday Jr. won the NASCAR Winston 200 on Saturday night at El Cajon to 
break a seven-year losing streak at Cajon Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 Hornaday, who started second in the 18-car field, finished ahead of P.J. Jones 
as the 200-lap Winston West Series event ended under a yellow flag after Jeff 
Davis' accident with two laps remaining.

GOLF ROUNDUP; DRAMATIC RALLY GIVES LOWERY FIRST VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Lowery, earning his first victory in seven seasons on the PGA Tour, used 
two dramatic eagles on the back nine to vault into a tie and then beat Rick 
Fehr in a playoff Sunday to win the International at Castle Rock, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery, as many as 10 points off the pace after two bogeys in his first five 
holes, eagled both of the par-fives on the back nine -- worth five points 
apiece under the modified Stableford scoring system used in this unusual 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery and Fehr both overtook Ernie Els late in the round and tied for first 
with 35 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery was four points behind third-round leader Keith Clearwater to start the 
final round and showed no early indications of being a factor. Through 13 
holes, Lowery had 25 points -- one fewer than when he started -- and was still 
seven points behind Els. 
</P>
<P>
 But he dramatically boosted his standing with the five-point eagle at the 
par-five 14th hole, getting to plus-30. Then he eagled the par-five 17th, 
hitting his approach to within two feet of the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery, 33, prevailed on the first hole of a playoff when Fehr drove into a 
pond on the right side of the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking a drop, Fehr hit his next shot into a greenside bunker and 
blasted out his fourth shot several feet from the cup. Lowery, meanwhile, made 
a routine par to win the $252,000 top prize. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Rick hit his tee shot into the water, I honestly thought I still would 
have to make three to win," Lowery said. "I thought he would hole the bunker 
shot. When he didn't, I just said, 'Please let me two-putt.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just my time to win. When it's your time, nothing can get in the way. 
I've had people all over the country who've been pulling for me for so many 
years. It's such an accomplishment to finally overcome the mental barrier and 
win." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dave Stockton made golf history at Coon Rapids, Minn. He almost made it twice. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Stockton stood on the 18th green at Bunker Hills Golf Course and 
watched Jim Albus miss an eagle putt. That gave Stockton a one-stroke victory 
in the Burnet Senior Classic and made him the only senior player ever to post 
consecutive million-dollar seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton then stood in the media tent and watched on television as his son, 
Dave Jr., pulled into contention late in the International. But Stockton Jr. 
hit into the woods on the 17th, and the Stocktons lost a chance to become the 
first father-son combination to win PGA events on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your first win on the regular tour is very important," said Stockton, whose 
third victory of the year and ninth as a senior gave him 20 tour victories in a 
30-year professional career. "It would be worth way more to Junior, obviously, 
than this one is to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that this one wasn't worth a lot -- both financially and historically -- 
to Dave Sr. He earned $157,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning more than $1 million in consecutive years "was in the back of my mind 
starting this year," said Stockton, whose 13-under 203 included rounds of 68 
and 66 before Sunday's 69. "Winning is the name of the game. I'm going to make 
Trevino play a little bit more because I'm going to play most of the 
tournaments." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Trevino has won $1,176,866 this year compared to $1,059,045 for Stockton. 
Trevino is the only senior with three million-dollar seasons (1990, 1992, 
1994). 
</P>

 Jane Geddes birdied five of the last seven holes on the way to a five-under 67 
and a three-stroke victory over Dale Eggeling and Robin Walton in the LPGA 
Chicago Challenge at Naperville, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Geddes won the 11th title of her career by completing 72 holes at 272, 16 
under on the 6,256-yard White Eagle Golf Club course. 
</P>
<P>
 Geddes, tied at 12 under with Eggeling, began her winning run with a birdie on 
the 12th hole. After parring 13, she birdied 14 and 15 to push the margin to 
three strokes. A bogey at 16 cost her a stroke, but she closed with birdies on 
17 and 18 to draw clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably one of my more important wins I would say in the last two or 
three years," said Geddes, who hadn't won in more than a year. "Because I've 
worked at it, and because as I said, I had rededicated myself and really wanted 
to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was crucial. I just wanted to finish. I didn't want to make the money. I 
wanted to win and work under pressure. I just wanted to come from behind. I 
wanted to make birdies. I wanted to do all the things I did when I was playing 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was my goal for the next month or so. It's like a relief. It worked when 
I wanted it to work." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Colin Montgomerie made a 10-foot birdie putt on the final hole for his first 
victory on British soil, winning the English Open by one stroke at Coventry, 
England. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomerie, of Scotland, shot a final-round 69 for a 14-under total of 274 to 
beat Englishman Barry Lane, who led by two strokes with two holes to play.

SMITH LEADS COWBOYS OVER BRONCOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Emmitt Smith, making his first appearance since an MVP outing in the Super 
Bowl, took up where he left off by scoring a touchdown, setting up another, and 
rushing for 110 yards in 21 carries in the Dallas Cowboys' 34-10 exhibition 
season victory Sunday night over the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith sat out the first three exhibitions, resting the right shoulder he 
injured in last year's regular-season finale against the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the Broncos, he rushed nine times for 30 yards on the Cowboys' first 
possession, caught two passes for nine yards, and scored on a one-yard run. Of 
the 17 plays on the 85-yard drive, Smith touched the ball on 11. He rushed for 
44 yards in five carries on Dallas' second drive and had 16 the next time the 
Cowboys had the ball before losing a fumble on the Denver 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas' Troy Aikman completed 15 of 23 for 156 yards.

BEACH VOLLEYBALL; TWO EARLY BIRDS OVERCOME MORNING BLAHS, BAG TITLE

 Karolyn Kirby and Liz Masakayan said it was tough getting up at 5:30 a.m. to 
play in an 8 a.m. winners' bracket final at the $40,000 World Championships in 
Manhattan Beach on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Things got off to a bad start, they said, because their nearby hotel didn't 
serve breakfast at 6:30 a.m. as promised and the Jacuzzi, which they use to 
loosen up before competing, was out of order. 
</P>
<P>
 And the rough morning took a toll on Kirby-Masakayan, the tournament's 
top-seeded team and defending champion. Both women got off to a slow start 
before finally pulling out a 15-9 victory over third-seeded Dennie Knoop and 
Deb Richardson in the early morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11 a.m. final, however, was a different story. Kirby and Masakayan came 
out firing and easily defeated second-seeded Barbra Fontana and Lori Kotas, 
15-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was pathetic," Kotas said. "We played not to lose and that's the type of 
team you can't do that against. They kind of ran us over." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby and Masakayan have a 25-4 record against Fontana and Kotas, including a 
9-1 mark this season. They have teamed up to win 11 of 12 events on this year's 
Women's Professional Volleyball Assn. tour and will split $9,400 for Sunday's 
victory. Fontana-Kotas will divide $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final, Kirby and Masakayan jumped out to a 4-1 lead, then at 8-3 scored 
five unanswered points for a 13-3 edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Masakayan, a former UCLA All-American who played on the 1988 U.S. Olympic 
team, was unstoppable. She had an array of spectacular blocks and powerful 
kills at the net. She also served for nine of her team's points and played 
flawless defense. Kirby served for her team's last two points, the final one an 
ace down the line.

ERVINE'S FOUR GOALS HELP SPLASH MOVE CLOSER TO WESTERN DIVISION TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dale Ervine matched a team high by scoring four goals Sunday to help the 
Splash defeat Pittsburgh, 11-6, in front of 2,816 at the Civic Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Splash's fourth victory in five games on the team's seven-game road 
trip and reduced the magic number to win the Continental Indoor Soccer League's 
Western Division title to three. The Splash (17-6) lead second-place San Diego 
(16-8) by 1 1/2 games. The Splash has five games left and the Sockers have 
four. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas (20-3) has already clinched the Eastern Division title.  
</P>
<P>
 "I still think we have the toughest schedule out of San Diego, Las Vegas and 
Sacramento," Splash Coach George Fernandez said. "Not one of our games is going 
to be easy, and I think San Diego has the easiest schedule left. We play 
Washington (9-11), then go back-to-back with Vegas (14-9) and Sacramento 
(13-11) without Ralph Black and Denis Hamlett (because of suspensions), and 
then we play Dallas without Ralph. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to hope San Diego loses more than one or two games, but we own our 
own destiny. If we play the way we can, we should be able to win three games." 
</P>
<P>
 Ervine's four goals matched Raffaele Ruotolo's output against Monterrey June 
24. Ervine, who also had an assist, has scored a goal in 11 of his last 13 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruotolo scored a goal and had one assist; he has an assist in a CISL-record 24 
consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash jumped to a 7-0 lead 2 minutes 7 seconds into the third quarter 
before the Stingers (12-12) rallied to pull within 9-6 at 1:10 of the fourth. 
Ervine scored twice after that, giving him 31 on the year, and overtook Ruotolo 
(30 goals) for the team lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played the first half like a clinic," Fernandez said. "We played crappy in 
the second half. It was like night and day. 
</P>
<P>
 "For our talent, giving up six goals is embarrassing. (Pittsburgh) didn't even 
sniff the goal in the first half, and to give up six in the second is totally 
uncalled for." 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Neely scored two goals and had one assist since moving from defender to 
midfield to replace the injured Armando Valdivia. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamlett had a goal and two assists, and Rod Castro a goal and one assist. 
Shane Hickson and Paul Ratcliffe also scored; Ratcliffe's goal was short-handed 
and proved to be the game-winner. Paul McDonnell had an assist. 
</P>
<P>
 Goalkeeper Ruben Fernandez had 15 saves and improved to 2-1.

U.S. WOMEN'S SOCCER TEAM DEFEATS CANADA

<TEXT>
<P>
 The defending world champion U.S. women's national soccer team Sunday gave 
Coach Anson Dorrance the going-away present he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 By defeating Canada, 6-0, in Montreal, the U.S. team clinched first place in 
the CONCACAF regional qualifying tournament for next summer's FIFA Women's 
World Championship in Sweden and earned the right to be one of the top seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's game was the last for Dorrance after nine years in charge of the 
American team. His record of 65-22-5 includes a world championship in China in 
1991 and three CONCACAF championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been a wonderful ride," Dorrance said. "Coaching my final match was 
not as emotional as the night I announced to the team I was leaving. I really 
appreciate everything this team has done for me over the years." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant coach Tony DiCicco will take over today from Dorrance, who will 
continue to coach the perennial NCAA champion North Carolina women's team.

NEWSWIRE: SANCHEZ VICARIO OVERCOMES RAIN DELAYS, GRAF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Second-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario withstood four rain delays and four 
match points Sunday to defeat top-seeded Steffi Graf, 7-5, 1-6, 7-6 (7-4), and 
win the Matinee International women's tennis tournament at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was worth $150,000 to Sanchez Vicaro. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf, who has seven tournament victories in 11 appearances, earned $60,000. It 
was Graf's first loss on hardcourts this season after 32 consecutive victories. 
</P>
<P>
 The four rain delays lasted a combined five hours, the first a 90-minute delay 
before the match. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf lost the first set after being broken in the 11th game but came back 
strongly to break Sanchez Vicario three times in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf, who is 24-7 against Sanchez Vicario, was on the verge of another victory 
in the 10th game of the third set. She led, 5-4, 40-15, only to see Sanchez 
Vicario overcome four match points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had two match points against me, but never four," Sanchez Vicario said. 
"Steffi had two match points against me at Hamburg and I came back to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Graf, bothered by a sore back off and on in the last year, said the injury 
flared up at the end of the first game in the second set. She stretched out on 
the sidelines and went back on the court wearing a corset-like brace. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Boris Becker completed his sweep through the Volvo International by defeating 
seventh-seeded Marc Rosset, 6-3, 7-5, in the final at New Haven, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker, seeded third, didn't drop a set in the tournament, which was plagued 
by numerous rain delays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really had a dream week here," he said. "Too bad we only had two days of 
good sunshine." 
</P>
<P>
 Becker, a three-time Wimbledon champion and former No. 1 player, was true to 
his old form all week on his way to his 41st title and third this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth, over the whole week, none of my opponents have reached 
six games (in a set)," Becker said. "In all of my 41 titles, I don't remember 
it happening before." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Seventh-seeded Wayne Ferreira, who had to wait more than seven hours because 
of rain during a semifinal match on Saturday, needed only 59 minutes to defeat 
Olivier Delaitre in the final, 6-2, 6-1, to win the RCA Championship at 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second-fastest final match on the ATP Tour this year. 
</P>
<P>
 A light rain hit the Indianapolis Tennis Center stadium court during the first 
set, but the match continued without interruption. 
</P>
<P>
 The unseeded Delaitre, who did not lose a set and saw his serve broken only 
three times in five previous matches, was broken four times by Ferreira, who is 
ranked 15th. Ferreira took advantage of 22 unforced errors by the Frenchman, 
who was seeking his first tour title and had not faced a seeded player before 
the final. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Kyle Spencer of Rancho Palos Verdes defeated seventh-seeded Brian Patterson of 
Falmouth, Maine, 6-2, 6-2, in the final of the USTA Junior Grass Court 
Championship at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 In the girls' doubles final, Traci Green of Philadelphia and Amanda Augustus 
of Rancho Palos Verdes defeated top-seeded Lilia Osterloh of Columbus, Ohio, 
and Bonnie Bleeker of Indianapolis, 6-0, 6-3. Osterloh defeated Green in the 
girls' singles final Saturday. Track and Field

 Dennis Mitchell won the 100-meter dash in 10.13 seconds at the Telekom 
Sportfest Grand Prix meet in Cologne, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow American Jon Drummond was second in 10.17, while Osmond Ezinwa of 
Nigeria placed third in 10.28. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans swept the sprints when Gwen Torrence beat double European 
champion Irina Privalova of Russia in 10.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Privalova was second in 11.03, while Zhanna Tarnopolskaya of Ukraine was third 
in 11.14. Boxing  
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services were held for Jerry Nathanson, whose membership on the 
California State Athletic Commission was the longest-running in its history. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathanson, 83, chaired the state's boxing overseeing body in the 1980s. 
Nathanson died Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the elder statesman for the commission," said Bill Eastman, CSAC 
chairman. "Jerry really was our link to another era -- in fact, probably a 
couple of eras." 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina's Julio Cesar Vasquez handed American Ron (Winky) Wright his first 
defeat, scoring a 12-round unanimous decision to retain his WBA junior 
middleweight title in St. Jean de Luz, France. Miscellany

SHOP TALK: WORKER WANTS TO GIVE UP REST BREAKS FOR LONGER LUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Do you have a question about an on-the-job situation? If so, please mail it 
to Shop Talk, Los Angeles Times, P.O. Box 2008, Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626. Or 
call (714) 966-7873 and leave a voice mail message. Questions of general 
interest will be answered in this column on Mondays. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: I am a non-exempt employee who gets two 15-minute breaks and a half 
hour for lunch. Can I combine my breaks and lunch time to take a one-hour 
lunch? 
</P>
<P>
 -- A.B., Westminster 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The California wage orders require rest periods for non-exempt 
employees whose total daily work time is at least 3 1/2 hours. The orders 
mandate the rest periods, "insofar as it is practicable," be in the middle of 
each work period. The rest period must also be at the minimum rate of 10 
consecutive minutes for each four hours or major fraction thereof. Remember, 
the employee's rest period is indeed paid by the employer, while the lunch 
period is generally not paid. 
</P>
<P>
 The wage orders also generally prohibit employers from employing a non-exempt 
employee for a work-period in excess of five hours without a meal period of at 
least 30 minutes. There are several exceptions, however. One exception provides 
that an employee may voluntarily agree (preferably in writing) with the 
employer to waive the right to a meal period provided the employee does not 
work more than six hours in a workday. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a few occasions when an employer may obtain an exemption from the 
division of labor standards enforcement, but generally the employer must comply 
with the rest and meal period requirements. To answer your question, it is not 
permissible to "tack on" the rest periods to the unpaid meal periods to create 
a 60-minute meal period without pay in an effort to circumvent the rest period 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Elizabeth Winfree-Lydon, senior staff consultant The Employers Group 
</P>
<P>
 Question: My daughter had worked four years for an architectural firm and was 
recently laid off. She was given two weeks' pay, which seems rather meager. Is 
there anything in the law that defines what severance should be? 
</P>
<P>
 -- H.S., Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: There is no law governing or even requiring an employer to provide 
severance pay. However, if an employer has a policy -- either in practice or 
explicitly in an employee handbook -- that provides for severance pay, it must 
be applied equally to all employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The severance package offered by the employer may be increased by an employee 
asserting other claims, such as discrimination, retaliation for whistle-blowing 
or defamation. 
</P>
<P>
 If an employer requires an employee to sign a general release as a condition 
to receiving severance pay, a full evaluation of all possible rights should be 
obtained through an attorney. If an employer does not require a general 
release, an employee can informally try to increase the severance amount and 
then pursue the employer for more, if justified. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don D. Sessions, employee rights attorney Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How do you handle the sticky issue of securing job references from 
your current employer? Most prospective employers want to speak to your 
immediate supervisor, but I don't want my current bosses to know I'm looking 
for a job. Any suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
 -- R.P. Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Communicate the situation to the prospective employer. Perhaps other 
references, from earlier employers, colleagues and personal sources will 
suffice. Often, a prospective employer will put off contacting your current 
employer until after it is fairly certain that you will be coming on board -- 
using your current employers reference as only a "final check." 
</P>
<P>
 If the prospective employer insists on a reference from your current 
supervisor, you might want to inform your supervisor beforehand that you are 
exploring other job possibilities and that he or she will be contacted. It can 
be a sticky situation, but in today's work world, most employers recognize that 
many employees are exploring other career possibilities. If you are valuable to 
your current employer, that employer could make an offer to try to retain you. 
The situation could work out to your advantage either way. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ron Riggio, professor of psychology Cal State Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 Question: I work for a company that schedules overtime on the weekend. For a 
long period of time, we would normally work from 8 a.m. to noon on Saturday. 
All of a sudden, it changed from 8 to 11 a.m. Is there a mandatory minimum 
amount of time an employer has to have you come in for? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The wage orders of the California Industrial Welfare Commission, which 
covers most (but not all) California employers, require that if you are 
scheduled to work and show up for work but your employer does not have enough 
work to employ you for your full scheduled shift, you are entitled to be paid 
for half your scheduled shift or two hours, whichever is greater. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no requirement that employees be scheduled for more than two hours, 
however, and nothing legally prohibits your employer from cutting your Saturday 
schedule from four hours to three. 
</P>
<P>
 -- James J. McDonald Jr., attorney, Fisher & Phillips labor and employment law 
instructor, UC Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Is there any law that gives a working mother the right to bring her 
newborn to her job during regular working hours? 
</P>
<P>
 -- F.P., Lake Forest 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: There is no such law. While employers must give working mothers up to 
12 weeks of unpaid leave in connection with the birth of a child, there is no 
legal requirement that they provide child care. For help in finding a child 
care provider, try the Orange County Child-Care Assn. at (714) 960-7370 or the 
Kid Care Hot Line of the Children's Home Society at (714) 543-2273. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Calvin House, attorney Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P. adjunct professor, 
Western State University College of Law 
</P>
<P>
 Question: I have been working for my employer for close to a year. When I was 
hired, I was to receive a 25-cent raise after 90 days of employment. My manager 
told me she was too busy to give me my review at that time and that I would be 
given full retroactive pay from the date it was due. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was given my review, more than six months after it was due, my manager 
said that my raise was denied. I have the paper they gave me about their policy 
on raises and I asked my manager about this. She lied to me and made up 
something about it pertaining to something else. I am mad. I want my money. 
Twenty-five cents is not a lot, but it adds up. From Oct. 26, 1993 (which is 
when I should have been given my raise), until May, 1994, they owe me about 
$200. What can I do? 
</P>
<P>
 -- H.L., Garden Grove 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The answer depends upon what you were told when you were hired. If the 
company's policy conditions the increase on the employer's evaluation of your 
performance and the employer maintains that there were problems with your 
performance, then you probably have no recourse. If the policy provides for 
automatic increases, or you were told that you would automatically receive an 
increase without regard to your performance, then you probably would have a 
claim, which you could pursue with the state labor commissioner's office in 
Santa Ana.

HOT JOBS: FOOD SERVICE IS A FAMILY MATTER, MANAGER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE L. JONES

<TEXT>
<P>
 As Chuck Morales sees it, the food business is primarily a people business. 
That's how he approaches his job as food service manager at the Western Digital 
and Motorola cafeterias. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales, 46, works for ARA Services, which provides food and catering services 
at corporate cafeterias and other institutions. He supervises a staff of 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is to make sure the chemistry of the 'family' is correct and that 
everyone is making a team effort to provide good service," said Morales, who 
arrives at 5:30 a.m. each day to help begin the day's preparations. 
</P>
<P>
 For Morales, who owned his own pizza parlor for 18 years, being a food service 
manager has allowed him to remain in the business without the headaches of 
ownership. "I loved seeing everyone in my restaurant having a good time and 
watching the customers' kids grow up and start bringing in their friends. Food 
and people go together," Morales said. "But I also got tired of banging my head 
against the wall during a tough economy." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Morales closed his restaurant and joined ARA. In addition to 
supervising the staff, he orders supplies and plans menus with the chef. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this job there is an interesting combination of food, people and 
technology," Morales said. "I use a computer to track costs, plan recipes and 
keep track of inventory. It's indispensable since we serve between 800 to a 
1,000 meals a day and this requires careful planning." 
</P>
<P>
 His future projects include adding rotisserie chicken and blended health 
drinks to the menu. "I think the drinks would be popular in the mornings and 
late afternoons when people need something healthy to keep their energy up." 
OCCUPATION: Food service manager 
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: Supervising cafeteria and catering operations at company 
cafeterias, airports and institutions such as hospitals and schools; overseeing 
kitchen staff, food servers and cashiers; ordering supplies and conducting 
menu-planning sessions with cooks and chefs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualifications: Most have culinary school or restaurant background. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: By 1998, the number of food service managers in the county is 
expected to increase 10.6% to 2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: $30,000-$45,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: Working in a people-oriented environment and responsibility for 
motivating staff to provide good service and food. Managers are the official 
point of contact with customers and often work to incorporate their suggestions 
into the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: Beginning work as early as 5:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement: May advance to regional or area manager, in charge of several 
operations. Administrative options include research and development and 
marketing positions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "My job requires a fluid management style and the ability to respond 
quickly to a variety of situations." -- Chuck Morales, ARA Services

O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW; WHAT PRICE GLORY FOR OFFSPRING?; IRVINE CONCERT IS A 
DANDY BUT LEAVES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STATUS OF PUNK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Something is happening and I don't know what it is. 
</P>
<P>
 The Offspring, who hail from Orange County, returned from their 
platinum-plated road trip Saturday night and played most of their 
million-selling album, "Smash," in UC Irvine's packed, steamy Crawford Hall. 
The band played well on its homecoming, had some fun, and even managed to get 
the best of the echoey gym and its miserable acoustics. Most of the songs were 
nifty. The crowd of more than 2,000 people went generally bonkers. But I'm 
confused. 
</P>
<P>
 Were we seeing the triumph of punk rock, and, in particular, the fruition of 
Orange County's distinguished, 15-year contribution to it? Or were we 
witnessing punk's death knell? 
</P>
<P>
 Hasn't punk rock always been music that lives in opposition to the mainstream, 
a music of outcasts and misfits shouting warnings, mockery and vilification at 
the comfy, self-satisfied majority? How does that jibe with an album that sells 
a million copies in four months, with who knows how many units still to move? 
</P>
<P>
 Wasn't punk rock supposed to be music that required a special commitment on 
the part of its audience as well as the band? Then why were some fans -- not a 
lot, but more than a few -- heading for the exit after the Offspring played its 
career-making hit, "Come Out and Play," as the ninth song in a 13-song set? 
</P>
<P>
 (Simple good sense, you say: Who wouldn't want to get out of those sweaty, 
airless precincts? Yes, but since when did punk fans, those slam-dancing 
zealots, let good sense get in the way of their devotions? Just three nights 
before, nobody had budged from the even more packed and humid Troubadour in 
West Hollywood as Social Distortion, an original Orange County punk band still 
a step short of massive commercial acceptance, played a stirring concert with 
several hundred overheated human sardines straining to take in every last 
note.) 
</P>
<P>
 Why did the maniacal response to "Self Esteem," the second Offspring song to 
get substantial airplay on KROQ, seem so discomfiting? And don't such 
misgivings put me uncomfortably close to some of the most narrow-minded, 
contemptibly clubby college-rock tastemakers, who will repudiate good music for 
the sole reason that it can be appreciated by more than a small coterie of the 
superior elect? Shouldn't we be rejoicing that the music-industry machinery is 
finally grinding in favor of a worthy local band and an important, unfairly 
neglected style? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the crowd's response to "Self Esteem" was just a normal reaction to an 
exceptionally crunchy, catchy song, rather than a programmed response to radio 
programmers' king-making. 
</P>
<P>
 I know, this is supposed to be a concert review offering not confused 
questions but ostensibly illuminating observations. So, before we sink back 
into confusion, a few direct comments on Saturday night's proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic elements of the Offspring's success are not that baffling. Young 
rock fans have always loved loud, aggressive music that they can sing along to. 
Bryan Holland, the band's singer-songwriter, has been honing his ear for melody 
over the course of the three albums the Offspring have released since 1990. 
"Smash" marks his full-blown maturation, and with his leathery, foghorn yelp, 
with a touch of anxious reediness on top, he has a memorable, insistent 
instrument for putting that catchy stuff across. "Self Esteem" (coming soon to 
your living room via MTV) isn't the only song that sounds like a hit successor 
to "Come Out And Play." "Gotta Get Away," "Nitro (Youth Energy)" and maybe 
"It'll Be A Long Time" are also strong candidates. With punk suddenly, 
improbably salable, "Smash" could turn out to be the "Rumours" of the genre. 
</P>
<P>
 With bassist Greg Kriesel's backing vocals accenting the melody, Ron Welty 
drumming with the concentrated look of a jazz player, and guitarist Kevin 
"Noodles" Wasserman pogoing himself into a sopping sweat, the Offspring played 
cohesively and energetically. 
</P>
<P>
 The set lasted just 55 minutes, and, even given punk's hit-'em-quick and 
hit-'em-hard ethic, the band should have extended itself more. Why not play the 
lighter, ska-flavored "What Happened To You?" for an off-beat change of pace? 
Where was the Nirvana-ish "Dirty Magic," a highlight of the band's 1992 album, 
"Ignition?" What about the irresistible anthem, "Smash?" Maybe the Offspring 
think that playing the song, with its sure-fire, obscenity-laced, 
crowd-rousing, fist-throwing chorus, would be unfair play, like shooting fish 
in a barrel. On the other hand, including "L.A.P.D.," a routine piece of 
hard-core thrash, was a waste of time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Offspring once more showed their pride in local punk tradition, as Holland 
took time to invoke such Orange County precursors as the Adolescents, T.S.O.L. 
and the Vandals. Later, after noting that the band is sometimes mistakenly 
identified as a Los Angeles act, he led the audience in a cheer of "F--- L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the occasional cussword, Holland came off as the sweetest-natured 
front man in punk history, a tall, fresh-faced, fair-skinned, smiling fellow 
who, if not for long blond hair worn in braided cornrows for a touch of the 
exotic, would look exactly like the prototypical All-American kid. In the 
gritty world of punk rock, these would seem debits rather than assets. Musical 
value is behind the Offspring's ascent, not a fashionably dark or obstreperous 
image which, if Holland attempted it, would make him and the band look 
ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest is questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasn't punk always self-destructed in the face of mass-acceptance? That's what 
happened to the Clash, soon after it became the first punk band to score a 
million-selling album (1982's "Combat Rock"). And, with more finality, it's 
what happened to the late Kurt Cobain, who may not have played punk per se, but 
who embraced punk ideals. Suicide is an ineffably complex and, in the young, an 
ultimately inscrutable act. But Cobain's inability to truly accept that music 
can be both artistically uncompromising and massively popular was an apparent 
factor in his unhappiness. 
</P>
<P>
 The Offspring have not shown any signs of a dark side that will sabotage their 
success. On the surface, the biggest threat would come if Holland should get a 
hankering to return to the USC and the Ph.D research in microbiology he had to 
set aside in May when fame and fortune began to beckon. With set-for-life 
riches a real possibility (in true punk fashion, bless them, the Offspring 
spent just $20,000 to record "Smash," a mere 10th of what major labels consider 
a routine price for an album), Holland might decide to go back to his test 
tubes. Does this guy sound like a punk? 
</P>
<P>
 Very much so, if you pay attention to his lyrics, which he claims to knock off 
casually at the last possible minute before the Offspring record them. 
</P>
<P>
 The songs are intelligent, outraged about the present, guarded about the 
future, confronting the world with a combination of anguish, irony and sardonic 
humor. Amid deep disillusionment there is a determination to have fun, and to 
press on, as "Nitro" puts it, "like there's no tomorrow." Morose defeatism is 
for grungenicks. Musical and thematic hyperbole, coupled with displays of 
titanic instrumental prowess, is for metal bands. Good punk music is about 
everyday reality, and everyday survival skills, as filtered through the minds 
and talents of players who stay close to everyday living, yet catch a special 
creative spark. 
</P>
<P>
 Rock stardom on a massive scale eventually robs musicians of their ability to 
connect with everyday concerns. The often-hollow lyrical charading of the 
Rolling Stones' latest album is one example. John Lennon opted out of the 
machinery, saved his sanity, and restored his creativity. Neil Young, bless 
him, has always done something to throw a spanner into the machinery's works, 
switching styles in a way that keeps his popularity from growing too massive 
or, as he has with his new album, simply refusing to have any part of the 
touring or promotional limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 Can punk rock survive massive success? The proposition has never been fully 
tested, and the partial returns say it can't. 
</P>
<P>
 But we have hit a moment of great national nervousness, in which anger and 
suspicion run high, along with uncertainty over whether the promise of American 
life envisioned by the Progressives of a century ago is being irretrievably 
broken. Most of the original Orange County punks of 1979-80 were an openly 
disgusted, worried minority of malcontents living in a place where most people 
seemed to be secure, comfortable and self-satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 Times have changed. The world is a scarier place for individuals and their 
immediate communities. The most widely heard punk voice of the moment is that 
of Bryan Holland, the honors student, the dimpled, good-looking All-American 
kid from the epitome of suburbia, whose career-making hit is a sour account of 
the unstoppable insanity of reflexive street-violence, whose most recurring 
theme is distrust of leaders and their verities and pieties. In his 28-year 
lifetime those pieties haven't come close to measuring up to the punkers' 
reality test.  
</P>
<P>
 More than a million copies are in circulation of the Offspring album that 
contains this refrain, and most of its buyers are probably nodding as they sing 
along: 
</P>
<P>
 When will the world listen to reason?  
</P>
<P>
 I have a feeling it will be a long time.  
</P>
<P>
 When will the truth come into season?  
</P>
<P>
 I have a feeling it will be a long time.  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the question isn't whether punk rock can survive success, but what we 
can do about an America in which anxiety and disillusionment are so widespread 
that punk rock can succeed as never before. Punk rockers have always told us in 
the most stark terms that something is happening, and we don't know what it is. 
Perhaps it is a good thing that they have finally gotten through.

DANCE REVIEW; L.A. CHAMBER BALLET JOINS LO-CAL ENSEMBLE IN PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After several seasons of obsessive navel-gazing and desperate eclecticism, Los 
Angeles Chamber Ballet rediscovered its sense of purpose in a modest but highly 
promising collaboration with the Lo-Cal Composers Ensemble at the Japan America 
Theatre on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Formed in 1981, Chamber Ballet came to prominence in a series of distinctive 
projects that caught the look, sound and energy of the local art scene with an 
immediacy that made most other resident regional ballet companies look 
pathetically out of touch. 
</P>
<P>
 That sense of connection to this city and this moment informed new ensemble 
ballets by Laurence Blake and Raiford Rogers on Saturday, with Lo-Cal Composers 
Murielle Hamilton, Carlos Rodriguez and Christopher Guardino also presenting 
effective premieres of their own without choreographic enhancement. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Chamber Ballet didn't enlist any local visual artists for this 
event, so all its dances looked scenically bare and utilitarian. However, the 
Lo-Cal Composers managed to add a dimension of theatrical splendor to each of 
its segments and the level of performance remained impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Greene String Quartet seated on the left, Blake's "Delta Dervish" 
developed playful juxtapositions of classicism and vernacular motion for seven 
dancers that adroitly paralleled the building blocks of Roger Neill's jaunty 
score. Both music and dance reveled in speed, stabbing accents and bold changes 
of landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers' septet "Cabin Fever" began and ended like yet another installment in 
his familiar sleep-dancing series. However, Sandra Tsing Loh's lush, breezy 
concerto for piano and invisible (phantom?) orchestra clearly inspired him to a 
bracing, wide-awake showpiece punctuated by bursts of mass swooping and 
teetering -- plus splashy opportunities for such paragons as Daniel Kirk and 
Pallas Sluyter. 
</P>
<P>
 Enhanced by swirling light effects, Hamilton's "shed, swoon & skank" began in 
a moody wash of textures and then explored contrasts between the metallic 
percussion of MB Gordy and Joel C. Hamilton's bowing and fingering gambits on 
bass. Soon, however, their duet grew conventionally melodic and even jazzy, as 
if somehow pulled back in time. 
</P>
<P>
 Nostalgia also dominated Christopher Guardino's lush "Two Songs" for mezzo 
Stephanie Vlahos. In the first -- "Entry, October 15" to a poem by Walter 
Benton -- she sang unaccompanied, reclining on the floor as she reflectively 
invoked feelings that seemed heartfelt. In "Amour d'ete" (text by Guardino's 
father), she leaned against a piano and sang in a mannered cabaret style, as if 
feelings were merely another glamorous enhancement of her performing image. 
</P>
<P>
 On a stage strewn with luminous Ping-Pong balls, Marcus N. Eley played Carlos 
Rodriguez's "Crazed Corollaries" for amplified and processed clarinet. 
Manipulated by foot switches, the sound of the instrument could resemble 
everything from a train whistle to a whole woodwind section -- capabilities 
explored with wit and virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
 Completing the program: a revival of Blake's 1992 dance-drama "Tunnel" to 
music by Eric Ruskin. Powerfully danced by an 11-member cast led by the 
tireless John Funk, it provided a reminder of what Chamber Ballet looked like 
at its most pointlessly grandiose, with all the claptrap of contemporary 
European Neo-Expressionism imposed on a generation of American dancers born for 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 If the company truly has stopped straining for weight and scale in this manner 
-- and has returned for inspiration to the other creative artists of this city 
-- this special collaborative event will have proved not merely successful but 
redemptive.

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: THE REAL CITY CAN BE FOUND 'BEYOND THE FREEWAYS'

 Traversing television . . . and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 You're hot and irritated. You're driving (barely) south on the 405 through the 
Sepulveda Pass, mind-locked and gridlocked, a steam-spewing stall-out impeding 
northbound traffic to the left of you, two crashes blocking traffic ahead of 
you. And you know that when you finally do reach your LAX destination, merging 
with the other city mice and urban ants, more crowds will be waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 This "dystopia," as historian Leonard Pitt calls Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 This packed confluence of freeway motorists, joining in a "wordless creed" 
that writer Joan Didion says is "the only secular communion Los Angeles has." 
</P>
<P>
 This blankety-blank city. 
</P>
<P>
 But wait. Is Los Angeles only a vastness crisscrossed by traffic jams? Is it 
only O.J.? Menendezes? Rodney King? Paparazzi ? Hollywood hype? Gangs? Drive-by 
shootings? Racism? Riots? Kinkiness? A smoggy wilderness of earthquakes, earth 
slides, rock slides and wildfires? 
</P>
<P>
 That's the line we get day after day from the news -- relentless negativity 
that solidifies an image of a totally dysfunctional city characterized by 
misery and devoid of any joy or cultural richness. In fact, rarely on 
television anywhere is Los Angeles celebrated in ways that inspire pride -- the 
exceptions being the occasional "Life & Times" segment and Huell Howser's 
affectionate profiles of city life, both on KCET-TV Channel 28. 
</P>
<P>
 And, oh yes, one more exception comes to mind: the pieces (titled "Beyond the 
Freeways") that Sam Hall Kaplan has been doing the last six months for the 10 
p.m. Saturday newscasts on KTTV-TV Channel 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Way, way beyond the freeways is more like it, for Kaplan's vibrant stories are 
distinctively witty and literate for Los Angeles television, the only pity 
being that they're not available to a wider audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vision we present to many is indeed that of a wasteland, a network of 
sterile streets, overlooked by overblown houses and edged by an insular 
industrial complex," he began one segment. "But down a side street off of 
Jefferson Boulevard, amidst seemingly lifeless buildings, culture flourishes." 
In fact, it was flourishing in a small corporate gallery featuring sculpture 
and poetry readings. 
</P>
<P>
 In another piece, a straw-hatted Kaplan touted an exhibition of American flags 
at the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood -- Old Glories made of wood, 
pencils and even newspapers; flags as posters, as postcards, as cigar boxes, 
even as cigar wrappers. Refreshingly, here was something that L.A. chauvinists 
could really puff on. 
</P>
<P>
 As they could on Kaplan's Charles Kuraltish video essay capturing opening day 
for a kids' T-ball league in Santa Monica, his piece toasting Little Tokyo, 
another on the sculptures that have made downtown Los Angeles "a museum without 
walls," and a notably aromatic tribute to Southern California's wildflowers, 
the camera capturing a resplendent carpet of yellow. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep it up. If only more TV communicators would exchange freeways for side 
streets, stop to smell the wildflowers and explore the city's gardens of 
culture instead of wallowing in its stink holes. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 HE OWES US?: Advanced by Joe Morgenstern in an Op-Ed piece in The Times last 
week, it's an exotic theory indeed that actor David Caruso has somehow betrayed 
a public trust by deciding to give up his co-starring role as Det. John Kelly 
on ABC's acclaimed hit "NYPD Blue." 
</P>
<P>
 He seduced us, made us fall in love with his character and his show, and now 
is leaving us in limbo like some stinker of a guy sneaking away from his wife 
and kids in the middle of the night? Pooh on him because our lives will be 
enormously diminished if his successor, Jimmy Smits, is less appealing and 
endangers the future of the series? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that's life. No one ever said prime time was "Divorce Court." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does the Major League Baseball strike metaphor apply. Caruso is in no way 
analogous to rich players and richer owners suspending the national pastime 
because of a conflict over money. 
</P>
<P>
 For whatever reason, Caruso decided to quit. If viewers hadn't watched his 
show in sufficient numbers, ABC would be quitting him. That, too, is the way 
the game is played. Whether he's an actor or a plumber, all that Caruso owes 
anyone is his best effort. And his Emmy nomination for "NYPD Blue" suggests 
that that has not been a problem. 
</P>

 HARDHEADED: The most spectacular commodity on CNN these days is anchor Linden 
Soles' hair, an indestructible granite-like edifice (currently dark brown) that 
hasn't budged in months. He could get a hernia just carrying it on his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly as arresting, though, is Mary Tillotson's excellent work as host of 
"CNN & Company," the spirited half-hour chat show about issues (8:30 a.m. 
weekdays) that she took over after the departure of Catherine Crier. A former 
Capitol Hill reporter for CNN, Tillotson is a whiz at speedily processing 
information on the air. It helps that she is always prepared, always informed 
and always aggressive, rarely letting her guests (typically three women with 
contrasting views and political agendas) answer a straight question with a 
polemic. Don't mess with this woman. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, with Tillotson at the levers, "CNN & Company" on even its so-so days 
generates more light than CNN's better-known, noisier and older "Crossfire" 
(4:30 p.m. and midnight weekdays), which has become a predictable self-parody 
in its dotage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 THIS JUST IN: Don't be fooled by "The Home-Based Business Special Report," a 
deceptive newscast look-alike featuring a sober, businesslike female/male 
anchor team. It's a half-hour infomercial for a home-business product, and the 
number of disclaimers it carries and their prominence is up to each station 
that airs the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The anchors sit behind a desk on what appears to be a news set, introducing 
stories in the field as if this were an authentic news program instead of an 
advertisement. Anchor: "These next stories are about real people who are going 
out there and making it happen with a home business." 
</P>
<P>
 However, there's one giveaway that tips you that this is not a real newscast:

 TOXIC MENU: Cable's somewhat new TV Food Network is pretty tasty now and then. 
Easily its most indigestible item, though, is one of its main hosts. He's the 
ever-grating Robin Leach ("Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"), featured here 
as an interviewer of celebrities, most of whom appear to have only one 
connection to food: They eat it. 
</P>
<P>
 The network obviously cooked up Leach and his celebs in hopes that they would 
provide an early audience for this fledgling operation. Like some dishes, 
however, a tiny sampling of him goes a very long way.

THE LION KING AND HIS COURT; 7 FILMS ARE EXPECTED TO PASS $100-MILLION MARK 
THIS SUMMER 
</P>

<P>
 With no "Jurassic Park" on the horizon, there was little hope that this summer 
would match last year's record-breaking $2.1-billion box-office bonanza. But 
that's not what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no dinosaurs this year. But there was a lion named Simba, who 
grossed well more than $200 million, and a lamb named Forrest -- who approached 
that figure this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other films have hit $100 million and two more should hit the mark by 
Labor Day, the official end of the 15-week summer cycle that began Memorial Day 
weekend. All told, summer '94 should inch ahead of last year with an estimated 
$2.1-billion to $2.2-billion final total. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first summer in which seven movies are expected to exceed $100 
million. (There were five each in 1993 and 1989, the two other $2-billion 
summers.) Those seven films are responsible for about half the movie tickets 
sold this summer. However impressive these numbers, they're just numbers. They 
render the audience faceless, ageless and sexless. They don't tell us who went 
to the movies and how often, or if there was an actual rise in attendance or 
simply that tickets prices were higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts Art Murphy of the Hollywood Reporter and John Krier of 
Exhibitor Relations calculate the season somewhat differently. Both say that 
ticket prices have remained relatively stable (averaging about $4.14) since 
last year. Thus, any dollar gain indicates that more tickets were sold. 
According to Krier, sales this summer should be between 516 million to 530 
million tickets, compared to 513 million tickets sold last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Who bought those extra tickets? People who go to the movies went more often, 
says Murphy. The summer release pattern may have helped. The studios avoided 
competing head to head by opening higher-profile movies on successive weekends. 
Week after week a steady stream of films opened. Movie fans didn't have to 
scrounge around for something new. (It helped that many of the big movies 
satisfied too.) The infrequent filmgoer made at least one extra visit to 
theaters, according to Murphy. Every summer, infrequent filmgoers (who see two 
to six films a year) catch one high-profile film, and usually another at 
Christmas. This summer they saw at least two -- likely "The Lion King" and 
"Forrest Gump." 
</P>
<P>
 "Lion King" was an event even before it happened. Its popularity as a family 
pleaser was anticipated, if not at such Gargantuan levels. Disney's 
"unscientific" breakdowns, says a studio spokesperson, indicate that 70% of 
admissions have been adults -- either accompanying a child or on their own. If 
30% seems low for kids' admissions, it's because Disney's estimates include a 
formula that doesn't count repeat visits by kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount's oddly titled "Gump" infatuated the public perhaps in a way that no 
other adult-oriented drama ever has -- albeit with more than a dollop of 
"E.T."-style sentimentality and special effects. (Virtually every one of the 10 
top-grossing movies of all time, including "Star Wars" and "Batman," have been 
"event" entertainments aimed primarily at families or younger audiences.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Gump" attracted everyone -- teen-agers, adults, males, females, adults from 
urban and suburban -- and has done scads of repeat business. 
</P>
<P>
 Early previews had demonstrated the nostalgic music-laden film's wide appeal, 
especially as a trip down memory lane for baby boomers, one of whom cites it as 
"My Life's Greatest Hits." No one foresaw the strength of its appeal to other 
segments of the audience, particularly to teen-agers, according to Paramount 
Chairman Sherry Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
 The title character, played by Tom Hanks, epitomizes teen-agers' sense of 
awkwardness as adolescents. Says Lansing: "Every kid feels he's not the 
smartest or the best looking or the best liked." It also worked as an 
entertaining history lesson. Many teen-agers saw the movie several times, which 
accounts in part for its amazing resilience at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 Another lucky break for Hollywood -- though not for baseball fans -- has been 
the strike. Arriving in August, when box office begins a steady descent as 
schools gradually reopen, the test of wills between baseball owners and players 
helped stem the erosion. "Gump" got a late summer push from the millions of 
males who never got off their duffs while the season was going. 
</P>
<P>
 So did Paramount's early August release, "Clear and Present Danger," starring 
Harrison Ford, which hit theaters just as the strike was announced -- in part 
explaining why it's expected to out-gross its Tom Clancy predecessor, "Patriot 
Games." 
</P>
<P>
 Females also flocked to "Gump," even as the film industry continues to 
under-exploit that half of the population. Lacking a "Sleepless in Seattle" 
this year, women discovered "The Client" and even "Speed." A rare direct 
attempt to reach women, "I Love Trouble," didn't work, says one studio chief, 
because the target audience didn't buy a 26-year-old Julia Roberts falling for 
Nick Nolte, a man more than twice her age. That's a male fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one significant picture, "The Mask," was targeted primarily at the 
teen-age market -- a segment to which Hollywood was once enslaved. They're 
still present in sufficient numbers to boost that film over the $100-million 
level, according to New Line marketing head Chris Pula. The film also pleases 
slightly older males, but it's the teen-agers who are making up the bulk of 
return business, the factor that carries a film above $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Adults over 25 weren't enough to elevate "Maverick" and "The Client" to $100 
million -- again because they usually don't go to movies more than once as 
younger viewers do, according to Warner Bros. distribution head Barry Reardon, 
whose studio released both films. 
</P>
<P>
 But the over-25ers are the largest demographic bulge and they alone will carry 
"Maverick" and "The Client" into the $90 million-plus range, with an outside 
chance that both will squeak into nine-figure land. 
</P>
<P>
 While Hollywood continues to underrate segments of the audience, the obsession 
with the male action market may be exaggerated. By itself, the group is not 
proving significantly larger than other demographics. (That's true in the 
United States; overseas they're the biggest audience, which is why action films 
are in no danger of extinction.) 
</P>
<P>
 The summer's two big action movies, "True Lies" and "Speed," did well with 
core male viewers. But it was female attendance that gave them the box-office 
edge, says 20th Century Fox President Bill Mechanic. After targeting men early 
on, Fox altered its advertising strategy to feature Jamie Lee Curtis and Sandra 
Bullock, the respective co-stars of "True Lies" and "Speed."  
</P>
<P>
 Also exaggerated is the death of the sequel. Audiences felt that "City 
Slickers II" and "Beverly Hills Cop III" were more of the same. But there are 
other kinds of "sequels," or those films that have a built-in recognition and 
expectation. "Maverick" was, for the over-30 crowd, essentially a big-screen 
continuation of a once popular television series. Universal's "The Flintstones" 
and "Little Rascals" were kid movies marketed by courting the adults who were 
familiar with the titles, according to Universal Chairman Tom Pollock.  
</P>
<P>
 Disney has created a "tent-pole" -- films that can be relied on to perform -- 
without having to revert to conventional sequelitis, in the process broadening 
the interest and acceptance of animation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've broken through the prejudice some adults had against animated films," 
says studio marketing head Bob Levin. "Now audiences accept them simply as 
movies." The success of "Lion King" -- following "Aladdin" and "Beauty and the 
Beast" -- is the best advertising for next summer's animated arrival, 
"Pocahontas." 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount, with Harrison Ford, has hit into a similar skein with the Tom 
Clancy series. And John Grisham adaptations ("Client," "The Firm" and "Pelican 
Brief") are now three-for-three. With each new film, studios try to build on 
the core audience and work to make inroads with different demographics. 
</P>
<P>
 As happened last year, some industry sages are saying this year's summer 
record is likely to stand for a while. Others are already dusting off the 
national pastime's motto: "Wait till next year." TOP 10 FILMS OF SUMMER '94

POP MUSIC REVIEW; NGO TURNS LIBRARY INTO DANCE HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County nightclubs would have to start lending out a lot of mighty fine books 
to offset the musical competition they're being given lately by the San Juan 
Capistrano Regional Library. 
</P>
<P>
 For several seasons the library's Performing and Visual Arts series has 
brought a diverse range of performers to its stage, but this summer organizers 
seem to have turned up the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 The range of music they've presented is truly global, and the library's 
viability as a medium for music was more than cemented in June by a stunning 
performance by bluesman John Hammond, in which the singer-guitarist delivered 
what may have been his most emotional and fulfilling show ever in these 
environs. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is the library's courtyard a fine concert space, but Saturday night 
under a full moon, Samba Ngo and his band proved the locale also doubles 
splendidly as a Zairian dance hall. For both of the evening's two packed 
performances, those in the audience who weren't dancing in their seats were 
taking advantage of the lawn at both sides of the stage to dance nonstop to the 
physically transporting music. 
</P>
<P>
 The first show began, humbly enough, with Zairian-born Ngo (pronounced in-Go ) 
soloing on likembe , a Congolese variant on the kalimba thumb piano made from a 
gourd. He then proceeded to get more musical variety out of a Samuel Adams 
bottle -- blowing over its top -- than one would have thought possible. After 
that, he switched to his main instrument, a chrome-plated electric guitar, and 
started to churn.  
</P>
<P>
 Ngo and his six-piece band play soukous music, which translates to "having a 
good time." An apt appellation, as the music has a remarkable bounce and sense 
of celebration to it, mixing Congolese tradition, Western pop and soul and 
Latin and Caribbean influences. Ngo's instrumentation could be that of any rock 
band: two guitars, bass, drums, keyboards, congas and a dancer-percussionist. 
But the instruments are played in a decidedly non-Western manner. Like the 
popular music of other African climes, the guitars are finger-picked in 
rhythmic patterns that mimic the thumb piano. They and the other instruments 
mesh in a weave that creates a mood of timeless constancy, all the while 
flowing and changing in ways both subtle and overt. 
</P>
<P>
 The members of his interracial band come from both Africa and the United 
States, where Ngo has been based for several years in Santa Cruz. His second 
guitarist, Danjuma Adamu, hails from Nigeria, where he formerly played with 
political-musical firebrand Fela Kuti. He took some inventive solos but was 
even more remarkable in the way he and Ngo locked into propulsive grooves. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Ngo plays and sings within a cultural context, he doesn't sacrifice 
personality. He is an ebullient, quirky performer. His guitar soloing often 
seemed conversational, by turns emphatic and emotional or full of musical 
jests, unexpected rhythmic twists and dissonant chords.  
</P>
<P>
 Vocally he was even freer: yodeling, emulating the growly throat singing of 
South African groaners , soul shouting and crooning. And, regardless of the 
three languages (Lingala, French and English) he sang in, the lyrics reached 
out to listeners. Without seeming contrived, he also was an electric showman, 
with riveting, athletic stage moves and seemingly a different facial expression 
to accompany each note he played. Sometimes he got down on his knees to play 
directly to the children gathered in front of the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 As in much African music, there were morals woven into the songs. He 
introduced the number "Malonga" as being a musical trip to his village, but 
afterward explained that implicit also in that notion of community was the 
understanding of self respect and respect for others, and how without 
communication it is impossible to grow.  
</P>
<P>
 In "Mambu," one of his few forays in English, he related, with sympathy and 
humor, an exchange he'd had with a friend who'd vowed never to fall in love 
again. "But if you no love somebody, you're going to live life like a zombie," 
he declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Ngo's hourlong first show was a brief affair by most African standards, 
his second show stretched over two hours, and it truly was a stretch. Compact 
numbers from the first set tripled in length, growing like some organic thing 
drawing energy from the dancers (which included series director Jose Aponte, 
who is one funky librarian). Introducing one song, Ngo said, "Let's dance now, 
who knows tomorrow? The truth is the music." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps so. It was jubilant, enthralling stuff -- as musically complex and 
free-flying as it was rooted in irrefutable rhythms -- which allowed a listener 
scant time to disengage from it, but when one did and looked around the 
courtyard, it was to realize " This is what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
 In a world that's spiraling out of control, where greed and violence appear to 
be the prime movers, it so often now seems that differences in culture, race 
and age serve as walls instead of bridges between us all. But it sometimes only 
takes a small, simple moment to show it doesn't have to be that way, and that 
there are other forces at work. 
</P>
<P>
 One such simple moment was seeing the row of small children drawn by the music 
to the foot of the stage, their wide eyes fixed on Ngo throughout the 
performance in a rapt manner no TV show could command. Another was on the 
grassy dance floor, where all ages made room for each other, so between the 
children and senior citizens there were some six decades of footwork at play. 
</P>
<P>
 This is simple, basic stuff, and shouldn't be profound, because it should be 
commonplace. But such moments of shared culture and community are a rare thing 
in our strip mall landscape, and they need to be nurtured. 
</P>
<P>
 The library charged $3 admission for the show, half of what it costs just to 
park at some of the county's bigger music venues. Not surprisingly, the series 
is in need of sponsors and supporters. For information on future shows, call 
(714) 493-1752.

 Paramount Leaders: This weekend's box-office race ended in an apparent tie for 
first place between "Forrest Gump" and "Clear and Present Danger." The two 
Paramount films each earned about $11.2 million at the box office, according to 
early industry estimates. New Line's "The Mask" took third place with $7.3 
million. In fourth, Disney's "Color of Night" starring Bruce Willis, which 
opened to negative reviews, drew a disappointing $6.6 million. And at No. 5 was 
20th Century Fox's "True Lies" with $5.1 million. New Line's "Corrina, Corrina" 
played well in limited release. The movie starring Whoopi Goldberg averaged 
$10,000 per screen in 22 theaters. The weekend also brought some good news for 
Disney: The company broke the box-office summer record for a single studio with 
a total $400-million gross, beating the $393-million record set by Warner Bros. 
during the summer of 1989. The success of "The Lion King" helped with the 
lion's share of Disney's summer take -- the movie hit the $250-million mark 
this weekend, surpassing Warners' "Batman" to become the seventh most 
successful domestic movie ever.

 Penn Inks Deal: Sean Penn has signed a deal with Miramax Films to write, 
direct and produce movies. The three-year, exclusive first-look agreement was 
announced by Miramax co-chairmen Harvey and Bob Weinstein. The new relationship 
builds on Penn's current project for Miramax, "The Crossing Guard," which stars 
Jack Nicholson, Robin Wright and Anjelica Huston. The film, about two men whose 
lives collide, is currently in post-production and is set to be released later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaded: David Caruso, who's leaving the hit ABC show "NYPD Blue," reportedly 
has signed a $2-million deal to star in the Paramount movie "Jade." Caruso will 
begin working on the film after finishing four episodes of the police drama 
this fall, according to Sunday's New York Daily News. In "Jade," he'll play a 
San Francisco D.A. who investigates the murder of a socialite. The twist: his 
character is the former lover of the suspect. The movie's script was written by 
Joe Eszterhas; William Friedkin is set to direct. TELEVISION

 The Doctor Is In: Rob Morrow has waved off a report that his Dr. Joel 
Fleischman character was being written out of the coming season of CBS' 
"Northern Exposure" as retribution for his demanding a raise two seasons ago. 
Morrow corrected the rumor in a statement issued by a spokeswoman.

 Out on a Limbaugh?: Tonight's episode of "Entertainment Tonight" will look 
into the war of words between TV-radio commentator Rush Limbaugh and the new 
ABC sketch comedy show "She-TV." On last week's premiere of the show, cast 
member Nick Bakay did a parody of the newly married Limbaugh, in which he joked 
about Limbaugh's wedding being performed by Supreme Court Justice Clarence 
Thomas. Limbaugh was not pleased with the way he was portrayed on the show and 
had his attorneys file a complaint with ABC. On "ET," Limbaugh explains that 
the skit angered him because it made him appear to be racist. "She-TV" producer 
George Schlatter tells "ET" (KNBC Channel 4, 7 p.m.) that there will be no 
apologies from ABC or the show, and that this Tuesday's episode will include 
yet another Limbaugh parody. STAGE

 Jason and Julia in Westwood: Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus will be 
performing together on a Thursday night in something other than an episode of 
NBC's "Seinfeld." The "Seinfeld" co-stars team up on Sept. 8 at the Westwood 
Playhouse to give readings of a two-person dialogue based on the friendship 
between former "Saturday Night Live" writer Alan Zweibel and the late comedian 
Gilda Radner. The readings are based on the upcoming book "Bunny Bunny," which 
features memories of conversations with Radner written by Zweibel as a way of 
coping with his friend's death from ovarian cancer five years ago. Proceeds 
from the readings will benefit Gilda's Club, which will provide free 
psychological and social support for people with cancer and their families. The 
first such club is set to open in New York this winter. Alexander and 
Louis-Dreyfus will give one reading at 4:30 p.m. and another at 8 p.m. Tickets 
go on sale today. POP/ROCK

 Rod Stewart Sues Tabloid: Raspy-voiced Rod Stewart says his throat is fine, 
and he's suing a British tabloid for saying it isn't. Stewart seeks at least 
$40 million in the lawsuit filed Friday in Los Angeles against News Group 
Newspapers Ltd., which publishes The Sun. A Feb. 22 article said Stewart 
suffered from inflamed throat nodules and was unfit to perform. It also said 
the problem eventually would destroy Stewart's singing career. BETH KLEID

UNREALITY OF 'MI VIDA LOCA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Critics Shouldn't Dictate 'Loca's' Artistic Content" by Allison Anders 
(Aug. 15): 
</P>
<P>
 When the movie "Mi Vida Loca" came out, I was very excited to see a movie 
being filmed about gangs from our culture, Latino. I told myself that, finally, 
they are focusing on Latino gangs and depicting the problem to come up with a 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, I never went to see it because my youngest sister went to see 
it. I had called her, told her that this movie was out and it was a good movie, 
so I heard. I thought it would be a positive thing for her. 
</P>
<P>
 I had asked my sister how the movie was. She said it demeans our culture and 
that's not the way it is. Also, she indicated the movie just revolves around 
fighting for a guy who is in jail. It never revolved around the core of the 
problem: why young kids join gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was well-intentioned by Anders, and maybe this is a steppingstone to 
giving more attention to this problem within our people. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, then we must give credit for bringing out the problem so solutions may 
be put into play.

 Although Anders may have meant "Mi Vida Loca" to be an impassioned look at 
gang life, it disturbed me. If I didn't know any Mexicans, never had any 
contact with a gang member and lived in some area of the United States remote 
from both, I might conclude that all gang members are degenerates and 
pathological killers. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel this movie did more to stereotype than generalize. If the movie's 
purpose was to document, educate and entertain, it lost me in all three areas. 
The barrio may be where gangs fester, but it also harbors decent teen-agers who 
deplore violence, who don't constantly mouth four-letter words or jump into bed 
with every cholo . 
</P>
<P>
 I teach predominantly Mexican students. We have young Mexicans who have 
dignity, character and a sense of decency far beyond any stereotype attributed 
to them. And we have gangbangers and teen-age mothers who manage to graduate 
and go on to college. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than typify any ethnic group, we'd do better to highlight their 
achievements and look to the reasons why any kid goes astray: the breakdown of 
the family, lack of parenting due to absent working parents, insecurity brought 
on by a government people no longer believe in, decaying neighborhoods and, 
yes, violence in movies and on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 We might do well to provide more jobs and recreational activities for high 
school students and look for ways to help students build self-esteem and 
resolve conflicts without violence.

POP REVIEW; CUBA'S LOS MUNEQUITOS DELIVERS A VIBRANT DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LOPETEGUI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 "Can you hear it from there?," Rafael Navarro asked moments before the doors 
were opened Friday night for the group's Los Angeles debut by the Cuban-based 
rumba group Los Munequitos de Matanzas. 
</P>
<P>
 Navarro, a member of the acclaimed 14-piece ensemble, was speaking to a sound 
engineer at Pasadena City College's Sexson Auditorium, where the group also 
performed Saturday. When the engineer nodded approval, Navarro said, "That's 
it, then. We don't need no more tests." 
</P>
<P>
 He was right. 
</P>
<P>
 All that the outstanding group needed -- on only its second U.S. tour ever -- 
was some space, a few microphones and a willing audience. The Munequitos' 
magnetism and musical mastery did the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the case of all Cuban-based artists, Los Munequitos are allowed to 
perform in the United States only as a cultural act and paid on an 
expenses-only basis. The show was sponsored by the Institute of Cuban Folkloric 
Studies of Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as the most important representatives of rumba -- the main root of the 
many branches of Afro-Cuban rhythms utilized in salsa and countless other 
styles of Latin dance music -- Los Munequitos offered an intense but not solemn 
opening set consisting of religious santeria chants and ceremonial dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second set, the focus was on the three types of rumba -- ancient rural 
yambu (a mid-tempo approach in which a female dancer seduces a male); the 
urban, contemporary guaguanco (a faster beat during which the man pursues the 
woman) and the also rural columbia (an interaction between the dancers, 
drummers and vocalists). 
</P>
<P>
 Closing the second set, Los Munequitos offered a festive conga popular 
callejera that earned a standing ovation from the rumba-crazed crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 There was so much activity onstage during the two-hour event that it was hard 
to keep up with all the elements, even though the only sounds from the stage 
except the drums were from the fierce harmonies of six vocalists. The potent 
solos by the singers demonstrated where the great soneros, or top-notch salsa 
singers, learned their trade. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire evening was a rare and valuable examination of the spiritual and 
technical structure of Afro-Cuban music, all performed by dancers who sing, 
singers who dance and drummers who are among the most treasured exponents of 
their art. 
</P>
<P>
 Little on Friday night was conventional. The two male dancers didn't just 
dance in traditional ways, but added color and commentary to their moves by 
frequently injecting moments of delightful miming. Barbaro Ramos, one of the 
dancers, moved with the frantic gestures of a break-dancer, while the other 
dancer, Ramos' father Diosdado, added a flash of humor through shadowboxing and 
other visual punctuation. 
</P>
<P>
 Living up to its years of acclaim, Los Munequitos finally showed Los Angeles 
audiences that the group is today's rawest and most unadulterated 
personification of all the essentials that make us love Afro-Cuban music.

MOVIES REVIEW; 'BLANKMAN' APTLY NAMED CARTOONY BUMBLING HERO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Coming to Save Your Butt!" blare the ads for "Blankman." Whose butt are we 
talking about here? Not my butt. 
</P>
<P>
 Damon Wayans plays Darryl, a cretinous would-be super-hero -- a cross between 
Jerry Lewis in "The Nutty Professor" and Spike Lee's Mars Blackmon from "She's 
Gotta Have It" -- who rescues his city from the stranglehold of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl has no superpowers but he's a great inventor: He concocts Rube Goldberg 
crime-fighting contraptions. Clunky but game, he goes up against the local mob 
boss (Jon Polito) and saves the day. 
</P>
<P>
 This terrible little movie -- directed by Mike Binder and co-written by Wayans 
and J. F. Lawton -- does have a teensy fascination. As with Robert Townsend's 
"Meteor Man" last summer, "Blankman" posits a cartoony bumbling super-hero as 
the way out of inner-city misery. That misery, even in a goofball nothing of a 
movie like this, is so much more harrowing than the loopy attempts to fight it 
that the effect is almost poignant. 
</P>
<P>
 David Alan Grier, playing Darryl's brother, has a few fine low-comic moments, 
and Robin Givens, as a TV newscaster, keeps flashing a smile that could shatter 
the Hope diamond. But the all-too-aptly-named Blankman probably won't make it 
as a sequelized movie hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayans may intend him as a sweet-souled avenger, but he comes across less 
child-like than imbecilic. He's a fey geek. Can this be what the filmmakers had 
in mind? 
</P>

COUNTERPUNCH: IF FILM'S WORTH SEEING -- WE'LL COME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON MANN, Don Mann is a writer and producer who lives Malibu. He is working 
on two feature film projects. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So the executives in Hollywood are now blaming the moviegoing public for their 
poor performances at the box office ("A Squeeze Play Tags the Summer Box 
Office," Calendar, Aug. 2). I just won't accept that excuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount chairman Sherry Lansing says: "There was only room for the home runs 
this summer. Audiences rejected everything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Jerry Bruckheimer says: "Viewers seem to be returning time and again 
to their favorite films and have no interest in other releases." 
</P>
<P>
 Do they believe that a viewer would rather see "Lion King" three times than 
view the Disney film once and then take in two smaller films? If you make a 
good film, we will come. (However, good doesn't necessarily mean expensive. We 
will stay away from big films too. Remember "Days of Thunder"?) 
</P>
<P>
 As a screenwriter, I have learned that a good film has two characteristics 
necessary for broad-based appeal: empathy for the main characters and 
plausibility for the particular circumstances they are in. 
</P>
<P>
 If these two criteria were adhered to more closely, there wouldn't be as many 
flops. Rob Reiner has his first flop with "North." Why? Obviously few 
moviegoers in middle America had the desire to get a new set of parents, as 
Reiner's main character did. It wasn't plausible. The result? Poor box office. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the other busts of summer: 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount's "Beverly Hills Cop III" failed because no one wanted to see Eddie 
Murphy and Bronson Pinchot in that same old shtick a third time. "Baby's Day 
Out" is a rehash of a tried and true John Hughes formula that is totally 
implausible and plain worn out. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney tried to get us with "I Love Trouble," a love story about two 
reporters. Do you love trouble? I could not empathize with these two 
characters. No one else did either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Renaissance Man" had a business executive coming to the aid of the Army. I 
just don't believe it. "City Slickers II": While the original film had a very 
good premise concerning a man in a midlife crisis, the second has this same 
guy, who now has a cow for a friend, and he's going off to discover a lost gold 
mine. Maybe I'll see it on video. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasn't "The Cowboy Way" originally titled "McCloud"? By any name, it just 
wouldn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Little Big League" and "Angels in the Outfield" are formulaic baseball 
fantasy films, forcing us to relate to unempathetic spoiled kids. I can 
remember back before "Bull Durham" when Hollywood execs said you can't make a 
successful baseball movie. Now we know you can, if you have the right story to 
tell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wyatt Earp" has only grossed about $24 million to date. Why? Because 
moviegoers have already seen the story -- in "Tombstone." How much has 
"Tombstone" made? I think you need to combine the box office of these two films 
to get an accurate take on their popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the winners? They all had fresh, original plots with empathetic 
characters and enough plausibility to make them intriguing. Other films from 
other seasons bear out the "magic" of this formula. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason Steven Spielberg has been so successful is his radical divergence 
from the tried and true. "Jurassic Park" was the first dinosaur movie in 20 
years. Even a film with as dark a subject matter as "Schindler's List" scored 
big, not because of its budget or director but because of its empathy and 
plausibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Indecent Proposal" proved that it doesn't matter when a picture is released 
as long as the story is good. And so on. 
</P>
<P>
 If Hollywood seriously thinks that mid-range pictures can't possibly compete 
with big-budget films, I wonder why Disney would spend so much to acquire a 
company like Miramax Films, which has only been known for its success with 
smaller pictures. Quality product, fresh ideas and believable stories -- not 
somebody's track record -- are what make good films. 
</P>
<P>
 If there were 10 good smaller-budget pictures out this summer, as opposed to 
one "True Lies" mega-budget film, I would bet the returns at the box office 
would be comparable. What audiences won't sit still for is an industry that 
keeps raising ticket prices and then expects people to sit through banal films 
that have the exact same plot as half a dozen other movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Reardon, Warner Bros.' distribution chief, says there will be a lot of 
pictures this summer that will lose money. If the studios refuse to concentrate 
on quality product and go on giving green lights to pet producers with 
ridiculous projects, just for the sake of making them happy, then yes, there 
will continue to be a lot of losers. But then, that's Hollywood!

COUNTERPUNCH: WHO PLAYED THE LAST ACTION HEROINE?

consultant, motivational speaker and author of Life: A Laffing Matter. She is

<P>
 In looking over the summer movies, once again I find a preponderance of little 
boy films. In recent years, while attention focused on the "Home Alone" farces 
starring Macaulay Culkin, "Free Willy" (with a boy co-star) and even a dreadful 
film with Arnold Schwarzenegger and a little boy, I ran to see "My Girl." But 
even though it was about a girl, played very well by the talented Anna 
Chlumsky, all the publicity was about Culkin. Yes, there was a sequel, but how 
many other recent films have starred girls? Come to think of it, not much 
differs when it comes to women. But look who's running the film capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Just glimpse at what's out now: "Angels in the Outfield" and "Little Big 
League." There would be nothing wrong with a girl baseball movie -- couldn't 
any of those have had a sex change? (Especially after the success of "A League 
of Their Own"?) 
</P>
<P>
 And another slew of boy films is upon us: I realize "The Client" is based on 
John Grisham's book but. . . . And couldn't "Lassie" star a girl this time 
around? It wouldn't hurt my childhood memories of Tommy Rettig or Jon Provost a 
bit. Well, at least Lassie's a girl (although played by males). 
</P>
<P>
 Also trotting around the track now is "Black Beauty." Couldn't this 
incarnation be about a horse and the girl who loved her? How about a little 
girl trying to find the perfect parents in "North?" And here comes the '90s 
version of "Little Rascals" -- yes, there's a cutie-pie new Darla, along with 
eight boys and a dog. 
</P>
<P>
 I am looking forward to seeing Tina Marjorino, a 9-year-old actress who has 
major roles in two new releases, "Corrina, Corrina" and "Andre." This could be 
the start of a big career -- and I'll certainly welcome it. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up, when it came to heroines, I had few to none. Saturday mornings 
brought only one, "Annie Oakley," and I wanted so badly to be her. She was the 
sole oasis in a desert of males. 
</P>
<P>
 And Saturday matinees brought forth 17 cartoons, a newsreel and yes, more male 
films. Despite a crush on "The Lone Ranger," I knew I couldn't have adventures 
like his, or "Captain Midnight's" or even like those on any of the prime-time 
shows, which pretty much also starred men -- Westerns, cop shows, slick private 
eye guys. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing's changed much in Tinseltown, even with us female types fighting for 
liberation and equality in past decades. Men still run Hollywood. Testosterone 
rules filmland -- male-hormone-laden films starring clothed men and 
not-so-clothed women for adult boys; charming cute boy films with boy heroes 
for the younger set. 
</P>
<P>
 I admit to sometimes enjoying films like "Die Hard," and I am pleased that 
sweet films are earning big bucks these days too. And having strong female 
hormones, I still turn up for anything starring the talented and still gorgeous 
Paul Newman. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, I acknowledge a higher percentage of TV shows starring girls and women 
(I'm talking quantity here, not quality -- that's another issue), but I'm 
looking forward to seeing more films and TV with women both behind and in front 
of the camera, as well as writing the scripts, with lots of little girl 
vehicles for my niece to enjoy, so she can accept her future as a winner -- and 
not just cartoons where the heroine changes the beast or gets to fly on a 
carpet with the hero.  
</P>
<P>
 It's not that I want to do away with boy films, I just want an increase in 
vehicles for girls. And, interesting concept -- what about films where the 
girls and boys are equal stars and protagonists? 
</P>
<P>
 Every summer my dander gets up about the same thing; with this summer's 
releases, I'm putting it out there. It's time Hollywood woke up and realized -- 
and here's the bottom line you producers can understand -- how profitable 
catering to the 50% of ticket buyers who are females of all ages can be.

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; A LULLABY ON 'BROADWAY' NIGHT AT THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Hollywood Bowl Orchestra continued its soporific stroll toward September 
on Friday and Saturday nights with a "Broadway Blues in the Night" program that 
was, too often, a guaranteed cure for insomnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, conductor John Mauceri included "World Premiere Concert 
Performances" of works which had minimal orchestral substance.The first, a 
Mauceri arrangement of themes from Stephen Sondheim's "A Little Night Music," 
did little to enhance the original melodies and failed to even remotely recall 
its alleged model, Ravel's "La Valse." 
</P>
<P>
 "Free and Easy," like other recent Mauceri "World Premieres," was simply a 
collection of show tunes, in this case composed by Harold Arlen, with easily 
forgettable orchestrations by Quincy Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Mauceri's non-premiere items were much more appealing choices, including the 
Leonard Bernstein "Mambo" from "West Side Story" and Richard Rodgers' 
"Slaughter on Tenth Ave." 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra's best work emerged in a stylish rendering -- with an added jazz 
band concerto grosso -- of three movements from Ellington's "Night Creature." 
</P>
<P>
 Nell Carter -- a last-minute replacement for Jennifer Holliday -- was most 
effective when she was belting songs from "Ain't Misbehavin'." But her 
idiosyncratic articulation and unfocused vocal timbre never quite managed to 
get in sync with an earlier set of Gershwin tunes that clearly were 
orchestrated with Holliday in mind.

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; ZZ TOP FLESHES OUT ITS BODY OF BOOGIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The blues-rock boogie of ZZ Top cries out for just one thing: near-naked women 
to dance around the guys onstage. Or that's the impression the veteran Texas 
trio left at the Forum on Saturday, mixing its raw riffing with a leering stage 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 ZZ Top was perfectly willing to enlist the use of taped saxes and 
synthesizers, but couldn't do without the help of six women dancers in thongs 
who were more visible onstage than drummer Frank Beard. These female 
caricatures came to the aid of a band now a quarter-century-old that still 
seems to have more faith in crass showbiz than its own music. 
</P>
<P>
 It's always been ZZ Top's commitment to the roughest sort of white-boy blues 
that mattered, not the bearded cartoon characters they became with their 
discovery by MTV. At their best, guitarist Billy Gibbons, bassist Dusty Hill 
and Beard coalesced at the Forum into an unstoppable, alluring rock force. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Gibbons and Hill kept their matching, black, leather jackets on for the 
duration, beards swaying, as they marched in step across the stage and mixed 
old hits ("La Grange") with songs from their new "Antenna" album. The band also 
did "Viva Las Vegas" -- the worst version yet, but another good excuse to bring 
out the dancers again. This time they were in glittery Vegas show outfits, with 
feather boas and top-heavy headdresses, as if Gibbons' ribald fretwork didn't 
say enough already. STEVE APPLEFORD

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; JAZZ EXPLOSION BURSTS WITH TEXTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a name like Jazz Explosion Superband, you kind of expect musicians to 
jump through hoops of fire to give you a thrill. But when bassist Stanley 
Clarke, guitarist Larry Carlton, woodwind player Najee, drummer Billy Cobham 
and guest keyboardist Brian Simpson held forth at the Greek Theatre on 
Saturday, they delivered a fairly straightforward look at contemporary jazz 
with scant show-boating. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some of the numbers -- which explored such realms as pop jazz, R&B, 
jazz fusion and straight-ahead -- were pretty wild. Take the evening's major 
band showcase, a very modified version of Clarke's 1976 hit, "School Days." 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-minute number started with Clarke and Cobham stage front, the drummer 
holding a portable synthesized drum machine. The pair played a duet, Clarke 
feverishly slapping his bass strings as Cobham hit his machine with his hands, 
creating a musical hailstorm. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Clarke soloed, coaxing out wiry notes as glowing as a red-hot electric 
coil. Najee added electronic wind instrument tones that were as soft as a cat 
creeping across a carpet, and Carlton offered thick chunks of sound you could 
almost chew. 
</P>
<P>
 Most tunes were calmer. On the soothing "All Blues," Carlton's tones smeared 
like colors in a fading sunset. Cobham's "Pleasant Pheasant" found Najee 
playing notes on tenor sax that were like caramel candies with nuts inside -- 
firm on the outside, hard in the center. ZAN STEWART

MUSIC REVIEW; ALTMEYER'S GRAND RETURN GRACES STRAWBERRY CREEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As she had four years ago when she sang opposite a chamber-sized orchestration 
in Malibu of Brunnhilde's Immolation, American soprano Jeannine Altmeyer 
returned to Southern California to grace a concert organized by the 
still-struggling Strawberry Creek Music Festival on Saturday night in Thorne 
Hall at Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
 With similarly grand results as those reported in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in her mid-40s, Altmeyer remains in healthy Wagnerian voice, and she 
displayed that voice strongly in three groups of lieder by Brahms, Wagner and 
Richard Strauss. She did not journey above the staff, yet the high notes she 
did venture -- G-sharps, A-flats and an A-natural -- filled this hall with 
resplendent sound. She can make an auditorium ring. 
</P>
<P>
 On this occasion, a benefit for the festival, she made it ring often -- and, 
gowned in Grecian simplicity and celadon-green, she looked as heroic as she 
sounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite special moments when a glowing dramatic intensity combined with vocal 
splendor -- as in Wagner's "Im Treibhaus" and "Schmerzen," and Strauss' 
"Heimliche Aufforderung" -- Altmeyer did not invariably connect with her texts 
or color every syllable with meaning. Still, given the quality of resonance she 
achieves -- and it is a quality to be found in very few places in the 1990s -- 
to demand more and fancier detailing would be pedantic. 
</P>
<P>
 She was assisted capably by pianist Val Underwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Preceding the soprano's appearances on both halves of this program were 
Beethoven performances by younger members of the Strawberry Creek academic 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 A very gifted violinist, Nurit Pacht, joined pianist John Blacklow for a 
promising but largely half-baked run-through of the G-major Sonata, Opus 30, 
No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the Strawberry Creek Woodwind Ensemble -- oboist Ian Dahlberg, 
clarinetist William Wellwood, bassoonist Carolyn Lockhart and hornist Teag 
Reaves -- combined with pianist Blacklow in an over-exuberant, jolly reading of 
the Opus 16 Quintet. Sometimes, the most appropriate response to such quality 
overplaying is a broad smile.

SCREEING ROOM: TARKOVSKY'S SUBLIME VISIONS OF LONGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The New Beverly Cinema, 7165 Beverly Blvd., will screen the late avant-garde 
Soviet filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky's "The Mirror" (1978) and "Nostalghia" (1984) 
Wednesday and Thursday. The title of the shimmering, enigmatic "The Mirror" 
could easily refer to art itself in its eternal function of holding up a 
reflection to human nature so that we may see ourselves in it. With Tarkovsky, 
however, there's always a desire to see beyond this world into others -- in 
this instance the past, evoked through memory, imagination and dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarkovsky shifts between black-and-white and color, between past and present, 
in so intensely a personal way that it becomes beside the point -- and also 
futile -- to try to make distinctions. It's best to go with the film's gorgeous 
flow, connecting with it emotionally rather than rationally. "The Mirror" is 
above all an expression of longing for the past, specifically for a mother's 
love (and trying to find it in a wife), and a return to a Garden of Eden-like 
existence. But this is also a film with a double vision: While expressing that 
childhood desire for security that seems to remain in us always, it perceives 
its people from an adult perspective, and for all its luminosity, some of its 
memories are fear-laden and tragic. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarkovsky's films invite us to experience what we're seeing, to perceive a 
universe in which the line blurs between the natural and the supernatural. This 
radiant, sublime dream of a film begins with a televised scene of a therapist 
in the process of curing a stuttering young boy. If we are to take this scene 
as a metaphor, then "The Mirror" can be regarded as the work of a man who has 
found his voice and learned to express himself in his own powerful way. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarkovsky felt that nostalgia has a richer, more complex meaning to Russians 
-- "one that mixes the love of your homeland and the melancholy that arises 
from being far away." Although the film is a profound expression of Tarkovsky's 
own exile longings, it gives way to larger concerns when its poet-hero (Oleg 
Yankovsky), during an Italian odyssey, meets a "madman" (Erland Josephson) who 
protests against the disjointedness of society and professes the need to return 
to a simpler form of life. Above all, "Nostalghia" gives intense visual 
expression to the poet's increasingly desperate search for meaning and for a 
reconciliation of past (Russia) and present (Italy). In its stately, measured 
way "Nostalghia," in its culminating spirit of affirmation, becomes akin to a 
religious experience.

<P>
 The Evils of War: John Woo's "Bullet in the Head" (1990), a powerful, dynamic 
variation on "The Deer Hunter," returns Wednesday to the Monica 4-Plex for a 
one-week run. At once an epic adventure, war picture, gangster melodrama and 
buddy movie, it features three petty Hong Kong crooks who in 1967 take off for 
Vietnam, where wartime dangers are equaled only by the opportunities to acquire 
illicit fortunes; their fate symbolizes the evils of the war itself. 
Information: (310) 394-9741. 
</P>
<P>
 Senegalese Duo: The Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center, 681 Venice Blvd., 
Venice, will present Ousmane Sembene's "Black Girl" (1966) and "Borom Street" 
(1964) on Saturday at 8 p.m. What is so overpowering about both films is the 
understated matter-of-factness with which Sembene shows the casual cruelties 
and routine injustices that are the result of whites' ancient oppression of 
blacks. Both have been made with unflinching directness and simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first, a beautiful young Senegalese woman (Nbissine Therese Diop) is 
hired in Dakar by a French couple to care for their three children. 
Unfortunately, she accompanies the family back to France, where she becomes a 
virtual slave, and her employers simply forget that she is a human being. It is 
Sembene's major achievement that everything that happens is totally credible -- 
that the French couple could be so thoroughly monstrous and exploitative 
without realizing it for a second. 
</P>
<P>
 "Borom Street," a devastating portrayal of the evils of apartheid, will bring 
to mind "The Bicycle Thief." In this 19-minute film, Sembene's first, we meet a 
Senegalese cart man (Ly Abdoulaye) on his daily rounds. His troubles begin when 
he lets another black man persuade him to transport the man to the forbidden, 
magnificent white section of Dakar.

ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH / A SPECIAL REPORT: HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Foster and Jason H. Reid 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 KICKOFF: Most Orange County high school football players begin two-a-day 
practices today, putting in the hours they hope will lead to success. "It's the 
time for the kids to put away those suitcases, vacation is over," Sunny Hills 
Coach Tim Devaney said. "They have to get their bodies ready to do things they 
have never done before." . . . Marina High of Huntington Beach will open the 
season Sept. 1 against a Hawaiian team in the Shawn Akina Memorial Classic at 
Honolulu's Aloha Stadium, but play begins for most teams the following weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 GAUNTLET: Sunset League teams had better be on the ball this season -- after 
realignment, there are no easy games in league play. Edison, Fountain Valley, 
Huntington Beach and Marina, the league's top four teams, remain and are joined 
by powers Esperanza and Los Alamitos. The six schools have been in 17 section 
championship games since 1980. Said Edison Athletic Director Lyman Clower: "At 
the end of the season there is going to be a last-place team that could have 
done pretty good in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 REUBEN, REUBEN: One player who will be closely watched is Anaheim High's 
Reuben Droughns, who is on pace to set the county career rushing record. 
Droughns, a junior, gained 2,039 yards last season, seventh most in county 
history. If he keeps it up, he could pass Valencia's Ray Pallares, who gained 
5,396 yards from 1983-85. "It's going to be a little harder for Reuben this 
season because teams will be laying for him," Coach Allen Carter said. "But 
he's a little bigger, a little faster and a little stronger this year." 
</P>
<P>
 TONNAGE: Senior tackles Josh Beckett and Kris Farris of Santa Margarita High 
will make things difficult for opposing defenses. Beckett's 6-foot-5, 305 
pounds; Farris is 6-8, 275. Coach Jim Hartigan hopes they will help control the 
offensive line, but can Hartigan control the buffet line? "Those two have 
definitely increased our food budget," Hartigan said. "I told the person who 
runs the team meals to beef up the food this year. I don't want those two big 
guys mad at me."

<P>
 Harold Dobbs, a longtime San Francisco supervisor who challenged Joseph Alioto 
for mayor and co-owned the prototype restaurant for the movie "American 
Graffiti," has died after a lengthy battle with leukemia. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
 Dobbs, known for his devotion to the city, died at his home Aug. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a man who would forgo his own business and personal life to serve the 
city," said former Mayor George Christopher, who served on the Board of 
Supervisors with Dobbs. "His death is a great loss to San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Rosell, N.J., Dobbs served as supervisor from 1952 to 1964. He ran 
for mayor in 1963, 1967 and 1971, finishing second behind Alioto in his final 
race. Dobbs campaigned against the popular Alioto using the slogan "Have you 
had enough?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dobbs was also a successful corporate lawyer, bowling center operator and 
restaurateur. With partner Mel Weiss, he established the original Mel's 
Drive-In restaurant in 1947, which later became a chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The original served as the centerpiece for the movie "American Graffiti." 
</P>
<P>
 Time magazine named Dobbs among its "100 Young Leaders of Tomorrow" when he 
was in his 30s. 
</P>
<P>
 Dobbs is survived by his wife of 53 years, Annette Dobbs; four children and 
many grandchildren.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Call them temporary workers, part-timers, freelancers, contractors or 
contingent workers. Whatever they are called, most experts agree, they are the 
fastest-growing segment of the American work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, even the government agency that is supposed to compile the numbers -- the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics in Washington -- can't say exactly how many people 
are working outside the traditional job market that guarantees a full-time 
salary and health, vacation and retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The best indicator, says bureau economist Randy Ilg, is to look at the growing 
numbers of agencies offering part-time or temporary help. In fact, recent 
figures indicate that the nation's largest private employer is the 
Milwaukee-based temporary agency Manpower Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Since there is such a broad spectrum of workers taking on temporary employment 
-- secretaries, computer programmers, janitors, writers, engineers and graphic 
designers, to name just a few -- it is nearly impossible to draw overall 
conclusions about this growing trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are pluses and minuses," says Barry Glassner, chairman of USC's 
sociology department. "Many people who in other times would have had full-time 
employment with promotion possibilities and benefits can now only find 
temporary work where none of those goodies are included. "On the positive side, 
temporary work has made it possible for people to make major career transitions 
and move out of a work situation with which they are unhappy," says Glassner, 
author of a book (titled "Career Crash") on Baby Boomer employment crises. 
</P>
<P>
 In a new Voices feature, Working People, temporary employee Philip Leslie 
talks about the negatives of temporary work: the indignity of providing a 
service without full-time benefits, the lack of respect from fellow workers and 
the lack of appreciation from employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Those negatives appear to be most visible for people, mostly women, who 
provide secreterial or janitorial services, the experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "People employing temporary workers will tell you this is the greatest thing 
for women in the workplace because it offers them flexibility and a job where 
they make money right away," says Maripat Blankenheim, spokesperson for the 
Milwaukee-based advocacy group Nine to Five. "In actuality, studies show the 
majority of women working as temporary workers do so because there is nothing 
else they can get," Blankenheim adds. "There is no job security, health care 
benefits, paid sick care or vacation. How many people are going to be happy 
with that?" 
</P>
<P>
 There is little doubt that the numbers of temporary workers will keep growing, 
partly to reduce employee lawsuits and the burden of protective laws that often 
don't apply to contractors or temps. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more legislation you have to protect employees, the more there will be a 
move toward using contractors," says Jone Pearce, a management professor at UC 
Irvine's Graduate School of Management. "A lot of companies are seeking to free 
themselves from those legislative constraints."

 The rebuilt Los Angeles Central Library is more than the city's treasury of 
books and literature: Along with the adjacent Robert F. Maguire Gardens and 
nearby Spanish Steps, it is considered a "catalytic" project -- one that can 
accelerate improvements in an area -- in this case, rejuvenating the heart of 
Downtown. The library strategy serves as a model for 16 catalytic projects 
aimed at improving other parts of the city's central core included in the 
Downtown Strategic Plan adopted by the City Council Aug. 2. The strategic plan 
is the result of five years of work by 60 public officials, business leaders, 
architects, planners, economists and housing and social service providers. 
Charged with creating a vision of what Downtown will be like in 2020, the plan 
attempts to retain and attract business, while balancing needs for open space, 
social welfare, a homeless policy, housing, transportation and historic 
preservation. STEPHANOS POLYZOIDES 
</P>
<P>
 Lead consultant on Downtown Strategic Plan, Moule & Polyzoides Architects & 
Urbanists 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you make a city? We suggest catalytic projects. You begin from the 
place that's most complete and extend out from there. The project for the 
expanded Central Library with the Maguire Gardens and the Spanish Steps was a 
kind of consolidation. It reinforced pedestrian use, connected Bunker Hill 
southward to the redesigned Pershing Square and has been wildly successful. You 
can walk to a museum and the Music Center and the Civic Center is five minutes 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Downtown Strategic Plan, we reinforce the idea that buildings make 
streets and propose projects that reinforce the notion of walking supported by 
transit. Public spaces have to be formed along with buildings. Whether it's 
Paris, New York, Mexico City or Tokyo, the character of cities has less to do 
with buildings and more to do with the nature of open space."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: CONVERSATION WITH 
GORGONIO SANCHEZ AND MARCINE SHAW; COMPTON: 'OUTSIDERS ARE COMING HERE, MAKING 
ACCUSATIONS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Compton has undergone some rapid demographic changes in the last few decades, 
from mainly white to mainly African American to about evenly split between 
Latino and African American. Recent events, particularly the beating of a young 
Latino suspect by an African American police officer and the indictment of a 
former mayor on bribery charges, have made the region aware of the strains 
caused by these changes.  
</P>
<P>
 GORGONIO SANCHEZ is a member of the Compton Unified School Board and is the 
only current Latino citywide elected official. MARCINE SHAW is a member of the 
Compton City Council. They talked separately with Trin Yarborough for Voices 
about a city where the population is changing faster than city government.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: How is Compton responding to the Latino population that in the past 10 
years has come to number more than half the city's residents? 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw: Compton is going through major growing pains. I moved to Compton in 1973 
and lived in the same house until four months ago, when we moved two blocks 
away and turned that first house over to our son and daughter to set up a group 
home for teen boys on probation. In 1973 my neighborhood was 60% black and 40% 
white; by 1978 it was 90% black; by 1985 half black, half Latino; and since 
1989, 90% Latino. It eventually became a place for transients and gangbangers. 
People said, "Why don't you move?" But it didn't bother me because I was still 
the baddest one on the street! And I don't believe people should run, 
especially if it leaves neighborhood kids with no one to set an example. 
</P>
<P>
 Now with the major explosion of people newly arrived in America, about 30% of 
Compton Latinos could be undocumented. When you look at the voter rolls you see 
the only way a Latino can be elected is with the support of blacks. Yet some 
people are trying to use this population they know has so many undocumented to 
claim it's so large that it should be in charge of the city. The group that's 
hollering about discrimination knows it's not true. Their hidden agenda is they 
want to take over. 
</P>
<P>
 I was a deputy for (the late) County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn for 17 years, and 
after I retired I was elected to the Compton City Council in June 1993. Under 
our civil service merit system you pass tests to get hired, so the city can 
only do so much with its hiring. I worked on an affirmative action plan adopted 
by Compton in 1982, not just for blacks and Latinos but also for Samoans, 
Asians, Anglos, everyone. For the past three years you can hardly even apply 
for a job in this county unless you're bilingual. Then too, Latinos and Asians 
are seldom hiring blacks. Also, Compton has had a hiring freeze for two years 
but soon will hire seven to 10 firefighters, at least half Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez: When I came to Compton in 1955 it was mostly white. We were the 
second Latino family on our block, with no African Americans. Then the whites 
moved out and African Americans moved in, and now Latinos have moved in. Like 
with everything else, after you have been head of something and run it a 
certain way for years, and then a lot of new people come in who don't 
understand the system -- especially when that happens so rapidly -- it's very 
difficult for both sides. The problem is lack of communication, lack of 
understanding of one another's customs, and lack of respect. To get respect you 
have to give respect. Less than a year ago, on Nov. 2, I became the second 
Latino ever elected to office in Compton, though less than 8% of the voters 
were Latino. I anticipate that more Latinos will be elected in the future, but 
a lot of hard work must be done first. Right now we don't have many Latinos 
eligible to vote. We don't deny that many of them are undocumented. But I think 
the majority are legal residents since the (1986) amnesty (under which 
undocumented immigrants became eligible to apply for legal residency), and many 
will become citizens by 1995. Even if people are not legal residents this 
doesn't mean they should have no services. Government is of and for the people 
-- all the people. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you hear people in your own community say about the present 
situation? 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez: The Latinos are saying they are not being treated equally. They say 
the police and schools discipline Latino youths more severely than the blacks. 
And when they see one of two groups doing things for their own group, and not 
for yours, it's disturbing. For example, Compton celebrates one Mexican 
holiday, May 5, but has a whole Black History Month, and then claims there is 
not enough money left to celebrate more Mexican holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw: People feel bad about the accusations of discrimination because they 
feel they're not true. They're concerned that Compton is getting a black eye 
when it's been doing so much to improve its image. Latinos and blacks who have 
lived in Compton a long time are holding each other's hands saying: "What the 
heck's going on?" All of a sudden a lot of outsiders are coming here making 
accusations and demands when before, you couldn't even pay them to come to 
Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What should each side do to be sure the various government agencies deal 
with the changing situation in the best way possible? 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw: We need a system to help Latinos learn how to take and pass the civil 
service exams. We need to teach Spanish as a Second Language, not just English 
as a Second Language (ESL). We could give cultural awareness training to the 
Compton police and fire departments and to our city employees. And we should 
work with our youth because adults get die-hard in their thinking, but all the 
kids could grow up as true brothers and sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos should be friendly, should make a big effort to learn about and 
understand any new community they move into. Those of us already here have to 
understand that new people are going through major changes, feeling afraid, not 
knowing how they'll be accepted, worrying about their kids in school. I 
remember how I felt just coming to California from Texas when I was 14. 
</P>
<P>
 When you look around and find yourself in a situation that's changed so much 
so fast, you're probably doing more reacting than planning. When all this 
recent clamor dies down there are many people in Compton who are truly 
concerned about the citizens -- no, I should say the residents -- of Compton. 
Whether they were born here or just got here, they're here in Compton now. 
We'll all talk together and work this out. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez: Latinos need to understand that they must fight for what they need. 
If you want to be successful, you must do what is required, no matter if it is 
hard. Those who can vote should vote. Those who can register should register. 
In addition there is a group, Union of Parents and Students United, through 
which Latinos -- citizens or not -- can express their feelings. I am a 
fourth-generation U.S. citizen, born in Eagle Pass, Texas, and when I was 
growing up Latino kids there were segregated in school. Now right here today in 
California, Latino kids feel they don't have total respect and don't have equal 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino parents not only have to get involved in their childrens' schools, they 
need to try to get their kids into the mainstream. My four children all went to 
school in Compton. I would never let them be in a bilingual program. Kids need 
to know English as soon as possible. When you look for a job you are seldom 
given an application in two languages. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the people in power should be more understanding. In America you are not 
elected to serve only some of the people. When you take your oath of office you 
are swearing to represent everyone.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: WORKING PEOPLE; 
UNAPPRECIATED TEMPS: 'WORK FORCE LEPERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP LESLIE, Philip Leslie is on assignment as a permanent temp. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "You're a temp, aren't you?" 
</P>
<P>
 The receptionist addressed me with darting eyes when I presented myself one 
morning to start an assignment for a brokerage company. Answering yes, I 
expected at the least to be offered a seat while I waited. But she resumed 
answering calls, and I found a seat myself, watching while other arrivals were 
warmly greeted with offers of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 It was this occasion, just one of many, that explains why the word "temp" 
makes my skin crawl. 
</P>
<P>
 In the "old days," many temps were poorly skilled. But thanks to the "new 
days" of takeovers, downsizing and economic recession, there now exists a large 
pool of highly qualified, professional and well-educated workers to service the 
needs of corporate America. You can find everyone from stenographers to chief 
financial officers, medical technicians to physicians, even scientists with 
Ph.Ds. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of corporate America heralding this largess, we are still treated like 
lepers in the work force. We are often expected to come into an assignment and 
within minutes fix whatever was broken before we came in. We wear dozens of 
hats each workday, all of them "to please the boss nine ways to Sunday." Yet 
our pay and the way we are treated never reflect this. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of our level of experience or education, we are usually shunted 
into the smallest of cubicles and desks. An associate, a man with an MBA and 
CPA, started an assignment as a chief financial officer for a large retail 
operation. His work area was an open desk by the employees' kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 One mean-spirited global entertainment company I worked for removed the 
telephones from the cubicles of its temp workers, even though there was no 
evidence that unwarranted personal calls were being made. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, an office manager at one large corporation who needed a place to 
dump some filthy old file boxes waiting to go into storage eventually found the 
space in the very clean and well-organized cubicle of a bright woman I know who 
had been temping for the firm quite a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Another trend I've seen is the consolidating of all of the mundane, tedious 
and unpleasant work on temps. I once had an assignment doing nothing but bank 
reconciliations eight hours a day, five days a week, while four staff 
accountants played with their new computer programs. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's the appreciation factor. I worked on housing accommodations 
for a nationwide insurance company after the Northridge quake. On my 
initiative, I discovered an angle allowing the company to save over half a 
million dollars. A feeding frenzy developed among my "permanent" supervisors, 
all of whom wanted to take credit for my idea. I never received one cent by way 
of appreciation. Not even a formal thank you from the client or the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent article extolled the virtues of working temp, describing the flexible 
hours, great pay and even the chance to learn new skills. The truth of the 
matter is that the flexible work hours are usually only what suits the client; 
pay is generally half of what the client is billed, and new skills are whatever 
the client will teach. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as ever getting permanent jobs, many agencies hope this never happens 
even though most hawk both lines of business. Once they find out you'll work 
temp, you'll virtually never be sent on interviews for permanent jobs. The 
phrase in the business is "turning out," as though temps were prostitutes. I 
wonder if this is what the writer of the article meant when she talked about 
"carving a lucrative career from temping." 
</P>
<P>
 But one thing is certain: We are rapidly growing in number. It is conceivable 
in the very near future that temps will make up 20% of the American work force. 
A fact, no doubt, that will cause pounding of hearts among the agencies. But it 
also means one-fifth of the work force is "in transit," on hold without 
benefits or a defined career path, subject to the constant and daily whims of 
capricious employers. 
</P>
<P>
 So say "hello" to that temp in the cubicle next to you. It might really make 
someone's day. After all, temps are human beings, too. Besides, with the way 
things are going in corporate America, you might be one of us a lot sooner than 
you think.

 Orange County leads the state in toll roads, with three publicly developed and 
two privately developed such roads planned or under construction. But not 
everyone likes the idea. The San Joaquin Hills tollway, which would run from 
Newport Beach to San Juan Capistrano, has been the subject of litigation. Some 
people concerned with the projects offer their views: ROBERT POOLE, President, 
Reason Foundation, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Toll roads have come to California and Orange County is the leading edge. 
There are no current proposals for toll roads in Los Angeles County. Most of 
the routes that make sense already have freeways on them. The question for this 
county is whether we should convert some of our freeway capacity to toll roads. 
A lot of people would be willing to pay for premium access to one or two lanes 
that went at regular highway speeds, say 55 m.p.h., during rush hour. MARK 
CHAMBERLAIN, Photgrapher, Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
 The (San Joaquin Hills tollway) is going to be an environmental disaster. It's 
going through some very delicate environment, violating some of the last 
relatively fresh open territory -- the only vernal, spring-fed lakes in Orange 
County are immediately adjacent to it. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea that the toll road is being sold to the general public as a traffic 
solution -- all you have to look at where it's going to go to realize that it's 
not a solution at all. It's a means of accessing additional land for building 
-- to open territory for development which will further exacerbate the 
environmental problem. We are now rivaling Los Angeles in poor quality of air 
once you get away from the ocean. If the idea was to solve traffic then all 
they would have to do would be to take care to the bottlenecks that already 
exist; and we have to recognize that some form of mass transit is going to be 
necessary for all of us. CAROLYN WOOD, 26-year resident of Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
 I don't have any problem with toll roads if they fulfill what they're supposed 
to -- an alternative that would get you from Point A to Point B quicker and 
safer.  
</P>
<P>
 However, the San Joaquin Hills toll road, was planned a long time ago. The 
idea was to take people from San Juan Capistrano to, say, the 405 in Costa Mesa 
and bypass the El Toro "Y," which has for many years been a bottleneck. In the 
meantime the El Toro "Y" is going to be completed as a 23-lane interchange a 
year before the toll road's going to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the employment centers have moved and the massive development in the San 
Joaquin hills is no longer going to be built, will the toll road really be an 
advantage? MICHAEL STOCKSTILL, Director of public affairs, Transportation 
Corridor Agencies, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 The TCA is a public agency that will operate three public toll roads in Orange 
County. It's made up of the county and 12 cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The current toll roads have been in the planning since 1986. The principal 
benefit, obviously, is traffic relief and better air quality because the roads 
will reduce congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 What the public is getting are roads that otherwise wouldn't be built for 
decades because of the continuing lack of funds at the state and federal 
levels. There are toll-road projects throughout the United States that are 
being considered largely based on what's happening in California. GERALD 
PFEFFER, Managing director, California Private Transportation Co. 
</P>
<P>
 CPTC is a limited partnership which holds a franchise awarded by the state to 
finance, design, build and operate a 10-mile, four-lane toll-road improvement 
to the existing Route 91, the Riverside Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no free roads. Since World War II we've relied heavily on gasoline 
taxes to pay for our road system; but increasingly gasoline taxes aren't 
sufficient either to pay for new facilities or, in some cases, to maintain the 
roads we've got. Tolls are, by their nature, the fairest method of financing 
needed roads because only the users have to pay.

 Kwang-Fu, newly arrived from Taiwan, moves in with the Quinn family to learn 
English. The first day, he warms a metal pot in the microwave and overloads the 
washing machine.Kindly, his hosts caution him to ask for instructions before 
using the appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Mrs. Quinn prepares a special family meal. She places a beautifully 
roasted chicken in front of him, but notices that he only seems to pick at the 
food. She asks, "Didn't you enjoy my cooking?" 
</P>
<P>
 He answers, "Yes, it was delicious, and I will leave here just as soon as I 
find another place to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Quinn is dumbfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 Incredulous, Mrs. Quinn asked Kwang-Fu why he wanted to move. He explained 
that in Taiwan, when a person is not welcome, the host places a chicken with 
its head facing the unwanted party. Mrs. Quinn had placed the chicken in front 
of Kwang-Fu with the neck cavity facing him. He interpreted this as her request 
for him to leave. Mrs. Quinn reassured him that this was not an American 
custom.  
</P>
<P>
 During a New Year's meal, a Taiwanese boss may inform an employee he wishes to 
fire him by facing a chicken toward the unfortunate worker. If no one is to be 
fired, the boss faces the bird toward himself.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MAKING A DIFFERENCE; 
VISIONARY CARE FOR THOSE WITH POOR SIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many people think that those who are legally blind see only darkness. In fact, 
76% of those who are legally blind have some sight. Since 1978, the Santa 
Monica-based Center for the Partially Sighted has worked with visually impaired 
people to give them the vision aids, day-to-day living skills and counseling 
they need to make the most of their remaining vision and to stay independent. 
The center is the only low vision rehabilitation facility in Southern 
California that provides comprehensive services in one location for partially 
sighted people. The average cost for services at the center is between $500 and 
$800, but no one is ever turned away for lack of funds. Some Tips For The 
Partially Sighted 
</P>
<P>
 Some low-tech vision aids--talking clocks and calculators, large-print 
telephone number pads and playing cards, and raised-print checks--are quite 
inexpensive. These are available through the center's store and by catalog 
order. The center's staff also suggests no-tech adaptations that enhance 
independence at home: 
</P>
<P>
 Use rubber bands to identify cans: one around vegetable cans, two around 
fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Increase visibility of pots and pans by striping their handles with 
contrasting color plastic tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Indicate commonly used settings on household items such as toasters, stoves, 
radios, measuring cups using Hi Marks, a fluorescent gel that dries leaving a 
brightly colored raised mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Drape a contrasting color towel over the edge of the tub to make it easier to 
see the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Float a brightly colored toy in the bathtub to check the water height during 
filling. High-Tech Future 
</P>
<P>
 The Low Vision Enhancement System or LVES (pronounced "Elvis") will be 
available by prescription in October through the Center for the Partially 
Sighted in October. The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine developed 
the goggles in collaboration with NASA and the U.S. Department of Veterans 
Affairs. Cameras project video images through two miniature television screens 
housed in a wrap-around headset. Users of the $5200 unit see images that "look 
like you're sitting four feet from a 60-inch big screen television" according 
to its maker, Minnesota-based Visionics Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Moveable magnification camera enlarges images up to 9 times to read signs at a 
distance or pick up facial features. 
</P>
<P>
 Small video cameras mounted in front of each eye provide a 50-degree 
horizontal field of view at normal magnification. 
</P>
<P>
 Battery pack worn on waist allows user to adjust image's focus and contrast, 
switch between normal and zoom lenses, and zoom the magnification camera in and 
out. The unit can be hooked up to a television or computer to project video 
images directly into the goggles. Offering Help 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid guessing or worrying that you'll do too much or too little, the 
center's staff suggest that you simply ask partially sighted persons if and 
what type of help they'd like. A few general guidelines: 
</P>
<P>
 Identify yourself verbally each time you greet the person and when you enter 
or leave the room, as facial recognition may be impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 When accompanying persons into an unfamiliar room, escort them to a reference 
point like a chair or table. Don't leave them standing alone in the middle of a 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 To help someone into a car, guide the person's hand to the door handle. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of pointing or gesturing, use descriptive references like "It's two 
feet in front of you" and "The office is the first door on your right."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: YOUTH OPINION; 
ANOREXIC TEEN: 'WE NEED HELP, NOT INSULTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By 'SARAH DOE', An estimated one in 200 young women between the ages of 13 and 
20 worldwide have anorexia nervosa, according to Dr. Michael Strober, head of 
the eating disorder program at UCLA's Neuropsychiatric Institute. A Southern 
California teen who has the illness tells how it has affected her life. She 
requested anonymity. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm 15 years old and have anorexia nervosa. I'm not going to tell you that I'm 
recovering because I'm not. Sure, I'm seeing a psychologist and nutritionist, 
but I'm still firmly in the grip of this awful disease -- still focused on 
eating little and losing weight. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of months ago, a girl wrote in this column about her worry over a 
friend who wasn't eating. I'm sure that must be very scary for her, but she has 
no idea about how scary it is to actually be that person. 
</P>
<P>
 Every morning, I wake up and tell myself, "This is stupid. Today, I'm gonna go 
and eat an ice cream or I'm gonna have a nice juicy hamburger." But, no. I 
usually end up having a small peach for breakfast, a Cal 70 yogurt for lunch, 
and something like a bowl of rice or a baked potato for dinner. My "snack" is 
usually a handful of puffed wheat or a couple of pretzels. 
</P>
<P>
 I jog a couple of miles a day to try and burn off some of those calories. But 
it's getting harder to run. I'm getting tired more easily and get the weirdest 
dizzy spells. It scares me how incredibly hungry I am. And every once in a 
while, I lose control and eat "too much," which is more than 600 calories. 
(It's nice to know that I can depend on my Ex-Lax to rid me of the awful food.) 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think of anything except food all day. I purposely look through 
magazines with pictures of food in them, watch cooking shows and bake 
delicious-looking goodies for my parents. I'm not going to tell you how it 
started or when because I'm not really sure. I don't know how this thing is 
going to turn out, but I want you to try and understand, that's all. 
</P>
<P>
 I've dieted myself from 135 pounds to 105 pounds. At 5-feet-6 tall, I'm not 
looking too good. I have dark circles under my eyes and I'm pale. Everyone's on 
my case, and I still think I look fat. As miserable as I am, I still want to 
lose weight. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm asking those of you reading this to understand that it's not our fault we 
have this disease. We are not stubborn, nor are we trying to hurt anybody. We 
can't "ust eat." Know that we need help and support, not insults or pleadings. 
If you are a victim yourself, know that you're not alone. There are support 
groups out there that really help. Sixty percent of those with anorexia nervosa 
overcome the major symptoms, UCLA's Strober says.  
</P>
<P>
 Thank you for reading this and to my fellow sufferers, good luck.

 If Linus C. Pauling had never existed, it is possible that it would have been 
inconceivable that there could ever be anyone like him. He was a unique and 
controversial figure, not only to colleagues in whom he inspired the greatest 
respect and to professional rivals in whom he triggered complex emotions, but 
also to America's serious and dedicated chemistry students, who understood him 
as a great chemist, a great political crusader and inspiration. If America 
itself is sometimes thought of as a nation and society that is larger than life 
and unique to history, then perhaps this extraordinary scientist in some 
respects was a quintessential American legend. 
</P>
<P>
 As a chemist he made staggering contributions. His 1939 book "The Nature of 
the Chemical Bond" was regarded as a landmark in the history of science and his 
work on the molecular structure eventually led to his receiving the Nobel Prize 
for chemistry, in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 As a citizen of the world concerned about the terrible power of nuclear 
weapons, he was no less the towering figure. An outspoken critic of the spread 
of nuclear weapons, by the 1950s he was a most prominent proponent of the view 
that nuclear weapons should never even be tested. He crusaded tirelessly for 
that view and was rewarded, not only in 1962, when he won his second Nobel 
Prize (this one not for his contributions to chemistry but to world peace), but 
also in 1963, when the world's major nuclear nations inked the international 
test ban treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauling's passionate and at times extreme views were filled with a surpassing 
certitude that sometimes inspired emotions considerably the opposite of love 
and affection. In the politically tendentious atmosphere of the McCarthy era 
his anti-nuclear crusade made him a convenient figure for attack by 
anti-communists; and his highly original advocacy of massive dosages of Vitamin 
C for an astonishing variety of ailments and diseases struck many scientific 
colleagues as speculative at the most charitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, whether tilting at nuclear arsenals or the common cold, Pauling was 
undoubtedly a national treasure. His years at Caltech were the most thrilling 
and productive of his long and brilliant career. On Friday Pauling, 93, died. 
He spent his last years at his beloved ranch near Big Sur in Central 
California, but for his many admirers here he will alway be thought of as a 
Southern Californian treasure.

CLEAN AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan deserves congratulations for standing up to 
the Air Quality Management District and environmentalists and pushing for a 
delay in the new smog rules (Aug. 10 and 13). 
</P>
<P>
 Just like Minnesota has winters and Florida has hurricanes, Los Angeles has 
smog, and always did, even in the days of the Indians when it was called the 
"bay of smokes."The bureaucrats have been trying to clean our air for years, 
but nature won't let them. We're at a point now where the new smog plans from 
AQMD and EPA will cripple what's left of our economy and destroy a lot of 
individual freedom, but do hardly anything to improve the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Every politician running for office this November, from Kathleen Brown and 
Pete Wilson on down, should be forced to commit themselves like Riordan has. 
Will they stand with the ordinary people of Los Angeles and the basin and fight 
the regulators and environmentalists? Or will they cave in and let the 
clean-air junkies make a disaster area of L.A. for the sake of air quality 
standards that nature won't let us meet?

 How distressing to read that Mayor Riordan's cynical, tired plan for economic 
growth in Los Angeles is to wage war on clean air. Here's another idea. Let's 
start with the premise that Angelenos are entitled to clean, nontoxic air. 
Period. Then let's create the strongest economy we can while continuing to have 
clean, nontoxic air. 
</P>
<P>
 If the mayor believes we can't have a strong economy and a healthy 
environment, then let's replace him with a mayor who thinks we can.

HEAT WATCH; DON'T UNPLUG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When authorities found Cynthia Blaire dead from heat exhaustion in her Palm 
Springs home in June, the temperature in the apartment was a brutal 110 
degrees. A week earlier Southern California Edison had turned off the 
apartment's power because Blaire, 68 and infirm, had failed to pay a $40 
electricity bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Public Utilities Commission (PUC) allows companies to disconnect 
power if a customer fails to pay a bill after a 15-day delinquency term and a 
48-hour notification period -- contact that usually occurs by phone or mail. No 
personal contact is required. And in Blaire's case, none was made. 
</P>
<P>
 Utilities do have third-party notification and low-income assistance programs. 
But sometimes people still fall between the cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics charge that the PUC collection guidelines do not properly address 
extenuating circumstances such as extreme weather conditions. Judging by the 
outcome in the Southern California Edison case, the critics may be correct.  
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to Blaire's death, Edison officials have wisely decided to change 
their disconnect policy during extreme weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, if the mercury rises above 105 degrees or falls below 25 degrees utility 
representatives will attempt to contact customers in arrears in person instead 
of over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, the PUC should reassess rules governing collection in severe 
cold or heat. In our opinion, it is utterly wrong to shut off anyone's 
electricity when temperatures can be fatal.

IS THIS ANY WAY TO RUN GOVERNMENT?; DMV'S COMPUTER BOTCH-UP IS A $50-MILLION 
LULU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Department of Motor Vehicles bungled a computer project, violated 
contracting laws and squandered $50 million in the process. As a result, 
California has nothing to show after seven years of trying to merge the state's 
massive driver's license database and its motor vehicle registration 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no wonder that for so many the DMV has come to symbolize all that's wrong 
with government these days -- waste, inefficiency, too much bureaucracy. 
Everyone has a DMV horror story. When opponents of President Clinton's health 
care reform wanted to denigrate the notion of government running health care, 
they pointed to -- what else? -- the DMV. 
</P>
<P>
 TROUBLE GALORE: The DMV's computer debacle was cited earlier this year by the 
legislative analyst's office as one of 11 troubled state computer projects. All 
were riddled with cost overruns, mismanagement and oversight failures that have 
cost California a total of $1.3 billion, or $1 out of every $23 spent on state 
operations. The nonpartisan office recommended that the Wilson Administration 
enact legislation or take specific actions to address these problems, but 
little, even in light of the DMV problem, has been done. 
</P>
<P>
 The DMV started out in 1987 with the good intention of using computers to 
modernize its antiquated system, improve service and create better tools for 
law enforcement. In the wake of its miserable failure comes the question of 
accountability. Three agencies were involved in the ambitious computer project, 
yet state administrators repeatedly ignored early warning signs. Instead, they 
continued to pour money into the project, often bypassing rules and regulations 
designed to curb runaway government costs, according to a state audit. They 
went so far as to allegedly circumvent state criminal laws by falsifying 
$46,000 in invoices to pay consultants. Spending finally ended last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit stopped short of identifying those responsible. Four lower-level 
bureaucrats, who were not named, have been disciplined as a result of the 
audit. Well-documented in that report were the actions of two top 
administrators, also not identified. Elsewhere they were disclosed to be state 
Lottery Director A. A. (Del) Pierce, who headed the DMV during the early, 
critical phases of the project, and Steve Kolodeny, director of the Office of 
Information Technology. The current DMV director, Frank Zolin, eventually 
stopped the computer project but only after putting more money into it, trying 
to salvage the program. 
</P>
<P>
 FOUL INHERITANCE?: Gov. Pete Wilson claims he inherited the DMV fiasco from 
Gov. George Deukmejian and says he is "disappointed the department was not more 
aggressive in surfacing the issue." He is dumping responsibility on Business, 
Transportation and Housing Secretary Dean Dunphy to review the audit findings 
for possible disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of action so far in the DMV case is as troubling as the waste of $50 
million. This can only contribute to declining confidence in government. 
Doesn't anyone in Sacramento ever get angry about something like this?

ENTITLEMENTS GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So, Jon Cowan and Rob Nelson think that senior citizens are getting much more 
out of government than what they put in (Commentary, Aug. 7). Evidently, Cowan 
and Nelson were shortchanged on their educational training. (I wonder, did not 
the over-35 crowd pay for most of that?) Their mathematics and economics skills 
are pathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 They claim that when Social Security began, there were 50 workers to pay for 
each retiree, but by 2025 the ratio will be 2 to 1. The assumption is that this 
is due to longevity, yet there is no mention of declining birthrates or 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 They further whine that the average 72-year-old will receive $98,600 more in 
benefits than he or she paid in. No mention of the debt owed to parents, 
teachers and others who fed them, taught them, protected them, changed their 
diapers, fought for this country in two world wars and more. 
</P>
<P>
 To repay what one cannot put a price on, Cowan and Nelson would slash their 
Social Security and Medicare and leave many of our elderly destitute.

 One of the problems of politics today is that many participants are more 
interested in fighting than in accomplishing something. They look for issues 
that can be exploited rather than problems that can be solved. 
</P>
<P>
 This bias shows when the directors of a group called Lead or Leave attack the 
composition of the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform because 
the young aren't adequately represented. 
</P>
<P>
 So they unfairly attack me and my Republican colleague, Rep. Bill Archer, as 
"entitlement warhorses" who will never make the tough decisions they think are 
required to reduce the deficit. Like many critics, they're ignorant of history. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, I've been moving in the same direction as Lead or Leave. I am seen 
as the godfather of the 1990 budget deal that made the first significant dent 
in the deficit in more than a decade. I created something called the 
Rostenkowski challenge, which called for reductions in anticipated Social 
Security benefits and other entitlements. George Bush responded with a proposal 
that we gradually turned into a $500-billion deficit reduction program, 
although neither Bush nor my colleagues in Congress would accept the Social 
Security changes I suggested. Last year, I led the battle for President 
Clinton's deficit reduction plan, which also aimed to cut the anticipated 
deficit by $500 billion over five years. It appears it will surpass that goal. 
And, earlier this year, I put forth a Social Security reform proposal that 
restricts benefits and raises taxes to guarantee the solvency of Social 
Security for another century.  
</P>
<P>
 If Lead or Leave thinks my plan is deficient, they should debate it and come 
up with a plan of their own.  
</P>
<P>
 The facts are simple. The deficit must be reduced. Entitlements must be 
brought under control. The young can't get the job done themselves. By joining 
with others who share their views even if they are members of another 
generation, they have a fair chance of getting the job done.

 Two Aug. 9 articles: 1) Special congressional task force indicates that 
existing entitlement programs, including Social Security and Medicaid, if left 
unchanged, will soon absorb all federal tax revenues to the exclusion of 
national defense, public safety, environmental protection, etc.; and 2) the 
Administration and congressional leadership are proposing to create the 
largest-ever, new entitlement with their revised health-care system. Do any of 
these people ever talk to one another? Where will the money come from?

 Re "Kurt Waldheim: Papal Knight?" editorial, Aug. 12: 
</P>
<P>
 As a Catholic, I am just elated that the Pope has finally seen fit to give 
ex-Nazi Kurt Waldheim a knighthood. How soon we forget the fun had by all in 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nazis gave our boys the opportunity for an all-expenses-paid trip to see 
Europe close up, from Omaha Beach to climbing up the steep hills of Italy and 
participating at the exciting Battle of the Bulge. 
</P>
<P>
 And the European Catholics had even more fun killing each other all over 
Europe. As a special boon, German Catholics and Lutherans got an 
all-expense-paid tour of neighboring Catholic countries and a winter vacation 
in Russia. Who can forget that! 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, who can forget those nasty German Catholic students and their 
priest who let it be known they had profound disagreements with the Nazis. 
Then, too, there was a distinguished German theologian who also disagreed. The 
adults were hung with a narrow cord and the students beheaded. The Nazis 
certainly knew how to handle those miscreants. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes. Now is just the right time for Catholics everywhere to celebrate the 
likes of Waldheim. How easily we forget what the Nazis did.

 The current furor (Aug. 11) concerning a very expensive new headquarters for 
the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) calls to mind the wise counsel of C. 
Northcote Parkinson in "Parkinson's Law." 
</P>
<P>
 He notes that organizations flourish in shabby, far-flung, inefficient 
facilities when their function is important. By contrast, the creation of a 
single, perfectly planned, plush central facility is a certain signal that the 
organization is no longer needed, and at the point of collapse. His evidence is 
compelling; e.g., Great Britain ran its empire effectively for centuries out of 
back rooms and cubbyholes scattered all over London. All this changed when the 
magnificent Empire House was dedicated in 1947, the same year India was granted 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
 The NRO was a creation of the Cold War and its performance was critical to our 
intelligence effort to track and predict Soviet actions. Does this new 
$310-million marvel of efficient centralization foretell a somewhat less 
productive role for the NRO in tracking unrest in Haiti, massacres in Rwanda 
and oil worker strikes in Nigeria? The Cold War is over but it appears that 
fact has escaped the NRO. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does Parkinson's wisdom concerning the relationship between perfect 
structure and obsolete function apply, but his warning in the Law of 
Extravagance is equally relevant: "Expenditure rises to meet income -- and 
tends to surpass it." Alas, he is right again!

</P>
<P>
 Who is responsible for the CIA's total independence, not answerable to anyone? 
It's time for the CIA to be accountable to the people who pay them!

 With the country's terrible financial condition, we must begin to research 
where funds are being misspent. Perhaps we can then find the needed funds to 
see that all Americans have health coverage . . . Perhaps we can even see to it 
that all libraries stay open.

SHOULD WITNESSES BE ALLOWED TO SELL THEIR STORIES BEFORE THE TRIAL?; YES: THERE 
IS INSUFFICIENT CAUSE TO OVERRIDE THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND BAN THE SELLING OF 
STORIES FOR PROFIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERWIN CHEMERINSKY, Erwin Chemerinsky is Legion Lex professor of law at the 
USC Law Center. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Legislature is now considering a bill that would make it 
illegal for a witness to a crime to sell his or her story to the media until 
after the trial is completed. Although this measure is inspired by the noble 
ideal of preserving a fair trial, it interferes with freedom of speech and 
should be adopted and ultimately upheld as constitutional only if it can be 
shown that the ban really is necessary. At this point, there is little evidence 
that witnesses selling their stories pose a threat to the fair administration 
of justice. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, introduced by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, obviously is a response 
to several instances in which witnesses in the O.J. Simpson case received 
payments from the tabloid press. In one instance, the prosecution apparently 
abandoned the use of a witness at the grand jury after she received money from 
the television show "Hard Copy" to relate her story. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the bill argue that witnesses who sell their stories to the 
media will lack credibility before a jury. Guilty individuals might be 
acquitted if key prosecution witnesses are not believed. Conversely, there is 
the chance that an innocent individual might be convicted if important defense 
witnesses are compromised by selling their stories to the press. 
</P>
<P>
 These are very important concerns, but in analyzing them it is essential to 
recognize that a law prohibiting witnesses from selling their stories restricts 
freedom of speech. An analogy can be drawn to a 1991 Supreme Court decision 
invalidating a New York law that prohibited crime perpetrators from profiting 
by selling stories. The so-called Son of Sam law also was motivated by 
important concerns: a widely shared view that it was wrong for a crime 
perpetrator to profit from the crime and a belief that such money should be 
given to crime victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court unanimously declared the New York law unconstitutional. The 
court explained that the law restricted speech based on its content. A crime 
perpetrator could sell a story to the media and profit unless the content of 
the story was about the crime. The court held that such a restriction of speech 
based on its content would be allowed only if it was necessary to achieve a 
compelling interest. The court concluded that the New York law failed to meet 
this test. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the proposed California law would limit witnesses' speech based on 
content: A witness can sell a story to the media before the trial about 
anything except the crime that was seen. Moreover, the public is informed when 
witnesses talk to the press, and the proposed law could lead to less 
information being conveyed if fewer witnesses speak to the media. The legal 
issue, therefore, is whether the law really is needed to achieve the compelling 
goal of ensuring a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 At this stage, there simply is no evidence that such a bill is necessary. The 
proponents assume that a witness who sells a story will lack credibility before 
a jury. Yet this is hardly obvious because countless witnesses retain 
credibility even when they are profiting enormously from their testimony. For 
example, in criminal cases, accomplices and participants in the crime often 
make a deal where they get immunity from prosecution or a great reduction in 
sentence in exchange for testifying. Inevitably, defense attorneys use this to 
impeach such witnesses. Nonetheless, juries often believe witnesses who testify 
with immunity, and thousands of individuals are in jail as a result of such 
testimony. Another example is expert witnesses who get paid to testify and yet 
are routinely believed by juries even though they, too, have a financial 
incentive to testify in a certain manner. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no reason why the jury will disbelieve a witness just because money 
was received for the story, especially if there are other indications that the 
story is reliable. For instance, if the witness told the same story to the 
police before selling it to the press, the jury is unlikely to think that the 
story was fabricated or embellished for profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, jurors often will sympathize with a witness who took money from the 
media to describe what was seen or heard. Many jurors will think that they 
probably would have done the same thing if they were in the position to make a 
large sum of money by describing what they have already told the police and 
will say in court.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps proponents of the bill can demonstrate that payments from the media 
causes witnesses who otherwise would be highly credible to lose that 
credibility. But up until now, the support for the bill is based on conjecture 
and is fueled by a dislike for the tabloid press and its checkbook journalism. 
The First Amendment demands that restrictions on speech be justified by more 
than a hypothesized harm and distaste for some of the media's practices.

SHOULD WITNESSES BE ALLOWED TO SELL THEIR STORIES BEFORE THE TRIAL?; NO: THE 
PROSPECT OF INSTANT RICHES FOR A SENSATIONALIZED VERSION OF EVENTS CREATES A 
GRAVE RISK OF MISRECOLLECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE FEIN, Bruce Fein, a former general counsel of the Federal 
Communications Commission, is a lawyer in Great Falls, Va., specializing in 
constitutional law. He testified on behalf of Brown's bill in Sacramento. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown deserves honors for writing a bill that would 
generally prohibit probable witnesses at criminal trials from being paid for 
media previews of their testimony. The bill, which is headed for a speedy 
enactment, is both a fair-trial and free-speech gem: It promotes reliable 
verdicts and it protects the search for truth in the public domain. Its 
constitutional moorings are sound, notwithstanding the lonely protests and 
fertile imaginations of the American Civil Liberties Union and some news 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, in Branzburg vs. Hayes, the Supreme Court held that the public 
generally has "a right to every man's (truthful) evidence," and that a 
journalist's First Amendment privileges do not extend to withholding from a 
grand jury the identities of confidential informants implicated in or otherwise 
knowing of crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's bill fits the Branzburg reasoning like a glove. The government's 
interest in all truthful testimony is compelling. But the prospect of instant 
riches for recollecting a more sensationalized version of events than fits the 
facts creates a grave risk of witness misrecollection, such as a subconscious 
or calculated embroidery of the truth. Typically, people come to believe in 
their false recollections after they have been publicly avowed. As Shakespeare 
taught, the wish is father to the thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Monetary payments for previewing testimony thus interferes with the 
truth-finding function of criminal trials, even if the witness is exposed to 
cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
 The allure of a fee for testimonial previews may also impair or scuttle the 
prosecution's case. As has already occurred because of the O.J. Simpson media 
extravaganza, a prosecutor may decline to present witnesses at trial who have 
received handsome sums for pretrial renditions of their stories because of the 
likelihood of withering impeachment of credibility on cross-examination. Jurors 
are likely to be skeptical of tales -- incriminating or exculpatory -- that 
have been purchased. But withholding witnesses denies the jury exposure to all 
pertinent evidence, and thus obstructs its truth-finding task. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, some might contrive false accusations of crime if they could be 
commercially rewarded by the media for pretrial retailing of their falsehoods, 
notwithstanding subsequent acquittals. 
</P>
<P>
 In sum, Brown's legislation deserves plaudits because it erects an important 
safeguard against monetary corruption of the truth-finding objective of the 
criminal-justice system. Moreover, the prospect of compensation and its 
vitiation of truth wars with an overarching purpose of free speech: the 
discrediting of falsehoods. In any event, the impending law accomplishes its 
objective with only a trivial impact on free speech. It would not circumscribe 
uncompensated interviews regarding testimony at any time. And the compensation 
prohibition unfolds only when the individuals have reason to believe that they 
will be called as witnesses in a criminal case. Finally, the prohibition lapses 
after judgment is rendered or on the first anniversary of the crime if 
prosecution has yet to commence.  
</P>
<P>
 There is no constitutional right to profit from expected participation as a 
witness in a criminal trial, which is a common obligation of citizenship. And 
the suggestion that a witness' story is inherently valuable rings hollow; its 
market value stems from the government's intent to prosecute, not from its 
originality and independent newsworthiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents object that the prohibition inhibits free speech; that without the 
prospect of compensation, some people will be discouraged from telling their 
story at all. Perhaps, but that would be their choice, not an external 
infringement of constitutional rights. The effect of Brown's bill is supported 
by precedent in this regard. Federal law, for instance, puts a ceiling on the 
outside income that judges, executive officials and members of Congress may 
earn by speaking, writing or otherwise. Not even free-speech enthusiasts would 
have the effrontery to claim that the ceiling is an unconstitutional inhibition 
of orations or opuses that might otherwise command a price. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's bill will have a significant affect only on the handful of 
sensationalized criminal dramas that arise in California. But public perception 
of criminal justice is largely forged from that handful, and confidence in its 
fairness suffers when checkbook journalism is afoot.

PERSPECTIVE ON MEXICO; A GREEN REVOLUTION IN POLITICS; FOR THE FIRST TIME, 
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, IMPORTANT TO THE RICH AND POOR, ARE BEING ADDRESSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RODRIGO J. PRUDENCIO and MARTIN EDWIN ANDERSEN, Rodrigo J. Prudencio is a 
trade specialist for the National Wildlife Federation. Martin Edwin Andersen, 
formerly on the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, writes about 
Latin America. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The electrifying competitiveness of Mexico's presidential election is but one 
of the sea-changes transforming public life south of the Rio Grande. This year, 
for the first time, environmental issues are taking a front rank in the 
country's political discourse. 
</P>
<P>
 The attention that Mexico's three major political parties have given to the 
"green agenda" is a direct result of the heightened awareness about 
environmental concerns that surfaced during the debate on the North American 
Free Trade Agreement, which went into effect on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Ernesto Zedillo, candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary 
Party (PRI) that has ruled Mexico unchallenged for the past six decades, issued 
a comprehensive 10-point environmental platform. In presenting the document, 
Zedillo pointed out that the contamination of the country's air, water and land 
has cost Mexico billions of dollars in treating preventable illness alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo's platform proposed the creation of a fund to capitalize and attract 
investment for sustainable development projects; a virtual revolution in mass 
transit; the installation of strong controls on smokestack industries and more 
attention to sewage treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Action Party (PAN) of the other front-running presidential 
contender, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, proposed to amend the constitution to 
include the right to a healthy environment and the concept of sustainable 
development. He also would mandate environmental impact statements to heighten 
community awareness on proposed development projects, and make existing 
environmental prosecutors' offices independent of the executive branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez's program forms part of his party's support for increased foreign 
investment and economic liberalization. According to environmental writers 
Enrique Provencio and Gabriel Quadri, the PAN's approach is influenced by 
international opinion that "the limitless power of technology" can be used to 
resolve the contamination crises; it proposes a greater transfer of technology 
from the developed world. 
</P>
<P>
 The Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD) of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who lost a 
1988 presidential bid in a bitterly contested election, linked its 
environmental program to issues of poverty, development and the creation of a 
New World Order but lacked specific proposals for action. 
</P>
<P>
 Provencio and Quadri say that the Mexican political community's tardy 
awareness of the environmental disaster in their midst is due in part to the 
fact that ecological issues did not fit neatly into the parties' traditional 
themes, which were narrowly focused on competing economic interests or 
political ideologies. 
</P>
<P>
 The increasing gravity of Mexico's environmental crisis has forced the 
politicians to focus their platforms on concrete proposals for its remediation. 
For example, although separated by an almost bottomless chasm of education and 
opportunity, the one political issue capable of striking a common chord between 
Mexico City's very rich and despairing poor are the many days that both are 
forced by air pollution to keep their children home from school. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, even President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's reformist government 
largely limited its environmental activism to the important but incomplete work 
of creating parks and protected areas. The contribution of NAFTA was to empower 
Mexicans to talk about their own environmental experiences and to call upon all 
levels of government to be more accountable and to take on more responsibility. 
NAFTA's promise of economic growth, of being in the "big league" of economic 
powers, required Mexico to give more attention to both social and environmental 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 This call to responsibility has had results both big and small. In the past, 
non-governmental organizations issued daily air quality reports from the 
smog-choked Mexican capital; today that is done by the city government. 
Newspapers and magazines are devoting far greater space to environmental 
issues, including exposes of wholesale dumping of hazardous wastes in heavily 
populated areas. The attorney general for the environment, although not 
independent from the executive branch, has stepped up enforcement mechanisms 
and is accessible to complaints from average citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican revolution in environmental consciousness also comes at a time of 
a broader demand for professionalization and decentralization of government 
power. Throughout Mexico, state and local governments are independently taking 
more activist roles in environmental protection. In the state of Sonora, for 
example, heavy emphasis has been placed on environmental problems posed by the 
low-wage maquiladora industries on the border. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent composition of a trinational commission on environmental issues, 
made up of Mexico, the United States and Canada, should also contribute to 
greater accountability of the Mexican government's environmental programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the news from Mexico's environmental front is encouraging. For 
example, in July the Chamber of Deputies approved reforms of Mexico's 
environmental laws prohibiting the importation of hazardous wastes, but not 
until an amendment was added at the insistence of industrialists, the Mexican 
Commerce Secretariat and the PAN to allow for discretion in cases considered 
"exceptional." 
</P>
<P>
 The best news, of course, is that the criticism, as well as Mexico's 
environmental progress, are now part of the mainstream of the political debate.

JACK SMITH: WITH 'FANS' LIKE THESE, WHO NEEDS ENEMIES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am often criticized in letters to the editor, which, if not published, are 
sometimes sent to me. If I do not quote them, the complaints go unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 This hardly seems fair to the readers who work so hard to abuse me. For 
example, Daniel Rightmayer calls my recent column on the CSICOP (Committee for 
the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal) convention in Seattle 
"bilge" and suggests to my editors: "Fire him." 
</P>
<P>
 He says, "Jack Smith is a phony. He is a vacuum. He has failed to live up to 
the basic responsibility of a journalist to know and tell the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 That seems aimed specifically at the award I received from CSICOP for 
"responsibility in journalism." 
</P>
<P>
 He calls my column "a pathetic attempt to lump recovered (or traumatic) 
memories of abuse with the claims of quacks and kooks." Actually, I did not 
express any disbelief in recovered memories; I merely quoted Elizabeth Loftus, 
author of "The Myth of Repressed Memory," who addressed the convention on that 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
 My attitude toward repressed memories is that unless they can be proved they 
should not be allowed to ruin lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Rightmayer wonders why I "revel in" the "In Praise of Reason Award" given 
Loftus "by a group of basically ignorant, self-important 'scientists'? Because 
he is as corrupt and ignorant as they are. Yet this callous, uninformed joke of 
a columnist passes himself off in your pages as a 'skeptical' thinker." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the meanest thing I said about the CSICOP members was that they 
dressed like "carwash employees." That was unfair. It would have been more 
accurate to say that they dressed as if they were skeptical of fashion. 
Actually their clothes were casual, comfortable and charming. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the abuse was aimed at my disbelief in UFOs. Of course UFO means 
Unidentified Flying Object, and almost any flying object I see in the skies is 
unidentified by me. I don't know one aircraft from another. But in the parlance 
of believers, UFO means a flying object from another planet, or a flying 
saucer. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't doubt that there are other planets with civilizations perhaps advanced 
enough to land flying objects on the Earth. I just don't believe it's happened. 
All the eyewitness stories of "flying saucers" and other visitors sound phony. 
We are a gullible species. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems odd to me that these visitors never make themselves known to anyone 
important. They always land in the boondocks somewhere and kidnap country 
bumpkins. I'm waiting for one of them to land on the White House lawn or in the 
Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Lloyd Larson writes: "I think UFOs exist, that they have visited the 
Earth and various continents for over 40 years, that they have an advanced 
technology and knowledge not yet attained by humans, that they are simply 
waiting and watching in case of a man-made disaster or crisis or nuclear war 
between Earth nations so that they can intervene in order to stop the war, and 
establish peace and order on Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me their benign intervention is already long overdue. If they've 
only been around 40 years or so, they arrived too late to do anything about 
World War II and the Holocaust. But certainly they could bring some relief to 
Bosnia and Rwanda. And with their advanced technology they ought to be able to 
cure AIDS too. What are they waiting for? 
</P>
<P>
 Several readers are troubled by my report that at the outset of the 
convention, someone asked how many delegates believed in God and not one hand 
was raised. (I was not present when that question was asked.) 
</P>
<P>
 Larson believes that UFOs are in fact the angels described in the Bible: "They 
seem to be here for a purpose not yet grasped or understood by us." 
</P>
<P>
 Larson suggests that the delegates declined to show that they believed in God 
because they hesitated to admit such a belief in front of so many nonbelievers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people in the audience at CSICOP were not willing to brave any ridicule 
or catcalls if they raised their hands and said (as we Americans have a 
historical and legal right to do) they believed in God. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in God," he says, "and I have a legal and historical right to say 
so -- because if we couldn't do this we would all be living under a communist 
or atheistic government. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Hawking, the brilliant British physicist, has good reason not to 
believe in God, or at least not to love him, since Hawking is cruelly disabled 
by the devastating Lou Gehrig's disease. Hawking says man may soon know how the 
univer s e began (or already does) -- "but I still don't know why it began." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, let us all -- believers and nonbelievers alike -- muddle over that one 
for a millennium or two.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; VOICES OF RAGE, PAIN AT WOUNDED KNEE PIERCE THE HEART; 
BULLET HEART BY MICHAEL DOANE ; ALFRED A. KNOPF $23, 316 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HARRIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What do we remember of Wounded Knee? Not the battle in 1890 that was later 
recognized as a massacre, but the confrontation with American Indian Movement 
activists on the Pine Ridge Sioux reservation in South Dakota in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 We remember that two FBI agents were killed, that AIM leaders were imprisoned 
and that Native Americans were still agitating years afterward for their 
release. That's about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Doane brings those faded news clippings back to life in "Bullet 
Heart," a novel that tells the story of Wounded Knee and related conflicts 
through the voices of white people and Native Americans alike, then dares to 
leave the apparent climax in the middle and go on to trace its effects on the 
lives of participants and witnesses two decades later. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullet Heart is the name of a boy wounded in the Bones War before he is even 
born. His mother, Delores Her Many Horses, is Sioux; his father, Tyrone Little, 
is a white sympathizer distrusted by members of the tribe.  
</P>
<P>
 Her Many Horses leaves the fictional Clay Creek reservation; Little finds her 
in a bar in a neighboring town with a man named Harold Bad Hand. Bad Hand tries 
to pull a gun and Little shoots him. The bullet passes through him, hits the 
pregnant woman and lodges next to the unborn baby's heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Doane pauses here. We don't know who Bad Hand is, why Little shot him, why Her 
Many Horses left Little, or whether the victims lived or died. We backtrack to 
an account of the Bones War, which begins when developers of a golf course next 
to the reservation town of Choteau dig up a pioneer cemetery. Bones of whites 
are ceremoniously reburied, but the bones of a Sioux girl are declared state 
artifacts and taken away. 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrations at Pierre, the state capital, achieve nothing. Native American 
anger mounts. On the reservation, AIM militants and "traditionals" square off 
against supporters of Bureau of Indian Affairs rule. Drunken men in pickups 
roam the dirt roads with rifles. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, across the line, on hundreds of thousands of acres that belonged to 
the reservation before whites nibbled them away, young Gaetan Avril allies 
himself with Little and Sioux leader John Fire Smith as a way of dismantling 
his father's empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Isaac McCaslin in Faulkner's "The Bear," who refused to inherit land 
tainted by slavery, Avril broods over records showing that his father snapped 
up 19,000 acres from Native Americans during the Depression. The former 
landowners live on the government dole, in trailers and tar-paper shacks 
surrounded by weeds and junked cars, drowning their despair in alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 As Her Many Horses says: "There's a black hole we're always staring into and 
after a while we just jump in." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bones War terrorizes but reinvigorates Choteau. Noah Lame, a college 
graduate who tried and failed to live in the white world, sees his skin "turn 
red again." Lame's son, Herman, builds a sweat lodge and becomes a spiritual 
leader. Old men and women relive the tortured past; young people discover their 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Doane describes the violence through multiple points of view, as if in 
fragments of a broken mirror. When it's over -- when two FBI agents and two 
Native Americans, including Herman Lame, are dead; when Smith and Little are in 
prison -- we know some things. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, we know that Bad Hand, who shot one of the agents, is a killer 
who was paroled in return for agreeing to spy for the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 But major questions remain. We still don't know who Little is, where his true 
sympathies lie or why Avril gave him a farm and a house to live in. Nor do we 
know why Avril, aside from the land-grabbing issue, hates his father and his 
father's friends so intensely. 
</P>
<P>
 A documentary would have to stop here, though, because the shooting is over. 
At most, it would add a brief epilogue. Doane risks another 100-plus pages. 
He's betting on the power of Little's and Avril's stories. They are powerful, 
even melodramatic, although his shifting back and forth in time and his 
fragmented way of telling their stories tends to play down the melodrama. Most 
of all, he's betting on the voices. 
</P>
<P>
 He wins. Doane's voices -- terse and eloquent, bitter and authoritative -- are 
a triumph of imagination. The sweetest of them is the voice of Joseph Her Many 
Horses, a.k.a. Bullet Heart, who has indeed survived to mow the fairways of the 
golf course where yet more Native American bones lie buried. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullet Heart's eventual meeting with Little and Smith only confirms what his 
very existence has suggested: that Wounded Knee was less an end than a 
beginning.

FERGUSON NEARS END OF BATTLE IN ASSEMBLY; POLITICS: COLORFUL NEWPORT LEGISLATOR 
HAS RESPECT OF FOES AS WELL AS CONSERVATIVES WHOSE CAUSES HE ZEALOUSLY 
PROMOTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the political jungle of Sacramento, some state lawmakers duck for cover 
when the going gets tough. Then there's Gil Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
 During a decade in the Assembly, the Republican from Newport Beach has 
consistently performed in the same gung-ho, damn-the-odds manner he employed as 
a combat-tested U.S. Marine. 
</P>
<P>
 Be it taking on archfoe Tom Hayden or pushing a resolution justifying the 
internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, Ferguson has demonstrated 
a ready zeal to wave the conservative flag and charge uphill against the 
Democrat enemy -- sometimes with only a few GOP foot soldiers behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 But now such battles beneath the Capitol dome could be coming to an end. 
Ferguson, 71, is retiring from the Assembly this month, and though he is 
plotting a run next year for the state Senate seat being vacated by Marian 
Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), he'll likely face tough competition from two 
Republican Assembly colleagues. As the Legislature winds down to its Aug. 31 
close of session, these could be Ferguson's final days. 
</P>
<P>
 His departure would leave Sacramento bereft of one of its most loquacious and 
colorful orators, a veritable foghorn for the ideological right. 
Ultra-opinionated, forthright almost to a fault, Ferguson has been drubbed by a 
legion of critics who have called him a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, 
anti-environment and anti-government. 
</P>
<P>
 Love him or loathe him, Ferguson is no standard-issue lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gil says what he thinks," Assemblyman Bill Jones (R-Fresno) said. "I don't 
agree with him all the time, but you always know where he stands." 
</P>
<P>
 Even die-hard liberal opponents concede a grudging respect for a man they 
consider one of the Capitol's true characters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fergie is Fergie," said Assemblyman John Burton, a Democrat from San 
Francisco, which Ferguson calls "Sodom and Gomorrah" during floor debates. 
"He's got his own point of view and he has fun sometimes with his hyperbole. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too late in life to change him." Rankling the Liberals 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson has managed to push his share of bills through the 
Democrat-controlled Legislature, including one that established a Caltrans 
office in Orange County, several aiding war veterans and another that tightened 
child pornography laws. 
</P>
<P>
 But he will be best remembered for staking out controversial positions that 
rankled liberals and for going down to a series of flaming defeats. 
</P>
<P>
 There was his proposal to castrate repeat rapists, which never got out of 
committee. His effort to block free condom distribution to teen-agers angered 
AIDS activists, who dumped 140 pounds of manure at his district office's front 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson has also made a career of attempting to ban the sale of sexually 
explicit tabloids from sidewalk news racks. That idea has repeatedly been 
squelched by lawmakers claiming it would violate First Amendment guarantees of 
free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some of his biggest failures have proven prophetic. Ferguson takes credit 
for proposing the state's first term-limits law. It lasted, he recalls, just 35 
seconds in its first committee hearing before lawmakers voted it down. But the 
idea was picked up for a state ballot measure and became law in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson's brand of politics clearly has appealed to his constituents. Voters 
in his coastal district, one of the wealthiest and most Republican in the 
nation, have routinely reelected him by large margins. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a basic floor he lives on, things he absolutely believes in, and he 
stands by them," observed Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange), Ferguson's 
closest ally. "There are very few people around here who are willing to stand 
up and voice their principles the way Gil Ferguson has at the risk of being 
called racist and anti-this or anti-that." 
</P>
<P>
 But some fellow Orange County Republicans act as though they'll be glad to see 
Ferguson go. Although he was once part of the inner circle of conservatives 
known during the 1980s as the "cavemen," Ferguson is left out of key political 
decision-making These days. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of his erstwhile buddies declined to talk publicly, but some privately 
confessed they have grown to consider Ferguson a bit of a blowhard, braggart 
and back-room bully -- a nuisance who rubs cohorts the wrong way during 
leadership battles and the election season. 
</P>
<P>
 With characteristic bluster, Ferguson consigns the infighting to the ash heap 
of political history. He came to Sacramento as an iconoclast, and that's the 
way he'll go out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got an agenda, and I don't fit that agenda," Ferguson said. "A lot of 
their waking time is spent strategizing about power, how to gain more power. My 
time is spent with the issues of the day and trying to do what we can to move 
things back toward ideological Republicanism." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson arrived in the Capitol carrying a resume filled with achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Marine, he served in three wars, was wounded three times and became a 
much-decorated combat officer. Ferguson was hit by shrapnel from a hand grenade 
on the tiny island of Tarawa during a World War II battle that proved to be the 
bloodiest in Marine Corps history. He rose through the ranks during Korea and 
Vietnam, mustering out as a lieutenant colonel after a career that lasted a 
quarter-century. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved on to private enterprise, first as an executive with the Irvine Co., 
then running a firm with his wife, Anita, that developed luxury homes. The 
building company was a success, then faltered during the real estate slowdown, 
but has since recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Ferguson, a USC graduate, wrote a book about his experiences on 
Tarawa, dabbled in oil painting and maintained a power boat, which he docks 
near his Balboa Island home and uses for deep-sea fishing. Favorite Uncle 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson first attracted the attention of Orange County conservatives during 
the early 1980s with a coalition he formed to push for better protection of 
property rights. With the help of conservative lawmakers, he mounted an 
underdog campaign for Assembly in 1984 against the son of powerful Capitol 
lobbyist Dennis Carpenter, a former state senator from Orange County, and eked 
out a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take long for Ferguson to make his mark. With his dapper suits and 
his jocular manner, Ferguson evokes the image of anyone's favorite uncle -- 
until he stands to deliver a speech. 
</P>
<P>
 In one memorable address during his freshman year, Ferguson tearfully blasted 
Hayden -- the Vietnam-era anti-war protester who represents the liberal bastion 
of Santa Monica -- as a traitor because Hayden had visited Hanoi during the 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the beginning of what would become a cause for Ferguson. Egged on by 
veterans groups, he pushed the Legislature to dump Hayden from office. Like 
many of his quixotic quests, the anti-Hayden campaign proved unsuccessful on 
the floor. But it reaped Ferguson other rewards: a mother lode of campaign cash 
and nationwide attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden and Ferguson haven't spoken since. But after the attack on Hayden, 
Capitol colleagues paid heed when Ferguson stood to speak. A legislative Rambo 
wielding a microphone like an M-16 automatic, Ferguson earned the nickname 
"Gilbo" for the deadly rhetoric he fired at Assembly Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even that nickname didn't do him justice," recalled Assemblyman Stan Statham 
(R-Oak Run), a Ferguson admirer. "When he first arrived, Gil didn't hit town -- 
he attacked it. He doesn't have that ramrod posture for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden wasn't the only politician to get caught in Ferguson's line of fire. 
From the beginning, the assemblyman pursued causes blatantly inimical to those 
in the legislative business. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, he sponsored an unsuccessful bill to put state lawmakers in the top 
tax bracket, reasoning that legislators should endure the burden of a new tax 
bracket they had imposed on the wealthiest Californians. More recently, he 
championed legislation that would have required lawmakers to resign from one 
political office before running for another. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I found when I arrived was men and women who had been here for decades," 
Ferguson said. "They were more interested in their power than they were the 
people's business. After 20 years, some of them 30 years, they think this 
building is theirs and they think this government is theirs." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson has also shown a penchant for taking on populist causes. He battled 
mightily against the new state law requiring motorcyclists to wear helmets. 
Closer to home, Ferguson has thrown his support behind elderly mobile home park 
residents and has stood up to the Orange County tollway agency on behalf of 
angry Newport Beach motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 A prolific letter writer, Ferguson also has become well known for his poison 
pen, dashing off caustic missives to the high and mighty across the land. In 
1990, he bashed George Bush for breaking a vow not to raise taxes. Other 
letters have unloaded on the chief justice of the United States, Republican 
Party leaders and Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
 Equivocation isn't in Gil Ferguson's dictionary, and sometimes it causes 
trouble. He once wrote a letter to a San Diego newspaper blasting 
then-Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-Chula Vista) for opposing a Ferguson bill. 
Peace confronted him in a Capitol hallway, and the pair had a shouting match 
that remains legendary in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 In another episode in 1990, Ferguson called a group of gay-rights activists 
"faggots" after they picketed a speech he was delivering. He later said he did 
not realize the word was derogatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden, the assemblyman's chief target, said that Ferguson has been virtually 
ineffective as a legislator. "He's attacked civil rights, affirmative action, 
gay rights, Hayden, environmentalists, and it must be frustrating for him, 
because as far as I can see, he hasn't gotten anywhere," Hayden said. "He's 
just kind of made his point." Breaking Ranks 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his rigid conservative views, Ferguson has occasionally proved 
unpredictable. Last week, for instance, he broke ranks with many Republicans by 
supporting a Democrat's bill to legalize the use of marijuana for medicinal 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 A veteran abortion foe, Ferguson has received campaign support from Operation 
Rescue and sponsored a bill to prevent police from using pain compliance 
techniques on protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the drubbing Republicans enduring during the 1992 presidential 
elections, Ferguson declared it was time for his party to stop dividing itself 
over futile battles such as abortion and gay rights. The stand shocked 
anti-abortion stalwarts and outraged many Republicans, who called him disloyal. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of this episode, among others, a gulf has opened in recent years 
between Ferguson and the rest of the Orange County delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 The rift can be attributed in large part to the anomaly of Orange County 
politics. Because Democrats are largely irrelevant in the region, the fiercest 
fights occur in GOP primaries, and bitter feelings can linger between the 
combatants. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Ferguson lost a close special election for a Senate seat to 
then-Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier), who was convicted this year on 
political corruption charges. Most of the Orange County delegation backed Hill 
or remained neutral, irking Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, his colleagues were stung when Ferguson agreed to become Assembly GOP 
caucus chairman under Jones, a moderate who had helped dump Orange County 
Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-Fullerton) from the Republican leader's chair. 
</P>
<P>
 But the situation really turned nasty when Ferguson and his onetime buddies 
backed opposing candidates in the 73rd Assembly District primary in 1992. The 
same thing happened again this year in the primary to choose Ferguson's 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Present-day political niceties also play a part in the feud. Most of the 
Orange County legislators are allied with Johnson, who is expected to move into 
Ferguson's district to challenge for the Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson's critics complain that he isn't a team player. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always looked down on the younger members of the Legislature," said one 
opponent. "Because he was a decorated officer, he always felt he should be the 
one calling the shots." 
</P>
<P>
 But what Ferguson's Orange County brethren view as disloyalty, some call 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of his Orange County colleagues are legislators as a chosen career," 
Statham said. "They're terribly interested in political ladder-climbing. That's 
not Gil's motivation. He's not going to sit around with them and plot and 
scheme." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Ferguson will always see himself as on the ramparts, leading the 
charge, waving the flag. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Roman legions, they had men in each company who carried the standard," 
the lawmaker said. "He'd rush among the enemy to plant it in the ground. All 
the other men would fight toward the standard to rescue him. That was his job. 
I view that as my job." Gil Ferguson: A Profile

MTA HUNTS FOR LEAK BUCKLING HOLLYWOOD BLVD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four blocks of Hollywood Boulevard remained closed Sunday as Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority engineers tried to find the source of a water leak 
that caused the street to buckle and the earth above two unfinished Metro Rail 
tunnels to sink -- in one spot, by as much as nine inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction crews were busy shoring up the two subway tunnels with steel 
reinforcements, while engineers searched for a burst or leaking water main that 
is believed to have loosened the soil under the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews also used jackhammers to remove 27 Walk of Fame stars -- including those 
of Carol Burnett, Melissa Gilbert and Jim Nabors -- to protect them from the 
construction work and buckling sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials said they hope to have the boulevard between Cahuenga Boulevard 
and Cherokee Avenue reopened this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The 45 residents evacuated from an apartment building Saturday were allowed to 
return home briefly and under official supervision to retrieve a few personal 
items Sunday afternoon, but were soon shuttled back to a nearby Holiday Inn, 
where they were staying at MTA expense for the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to minimize the inconvenience as best we can," said Edward 
McSpedon, MTA's executive construction officer. 
</P>
<P>
 All the commotion, however, has angered business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might as well close up and go home," said Pino Mohabber, who owns a 
minimarket on Hollywood Boulevard near Cherokee Avenue. "Sundays are usually my 
busiest day. But now, nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Sal Marsiano, one of the residents evacuated from the Hill View Apartments, 
also criticized the MTA for the inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, I couldn't get to my job for three days because of the MTA bus 
strike," said Marsiano, who works as a security guard on the Westside. "And 
now, because of the MTA, I can't get into my apartment. Yeah, I'm frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
 City building inspectors were checking the apartment house, which was severely 
damaged in the Northridge earthquake, to see whether the foundation was sound 
enough for the residents to return, possibly today. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, structural problems in the four-story brick apartment building 
forced officials to evacuate the tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems started Thursday, when construction workers noticed an unusual 
amount of water in the tunnel. After the MTA informed the City Council of the 
trouble Friday, the council ordered a halt to all tunnel construction in the 
area until workers could determine where the water was coming from. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to go any further until we know what caused this," said 
Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who represents the Hollywood area. "If you don't 
know why it happened, then how can you prevent it from happening somewhere 
else?" 
</P>
<P>
 According to MTA officials, the ground has sunk by as much as nine inches near 
the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Hudson Avenue. But at no time was 
the area in danger of collapsing, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have put in steel columns and horizontal bracing there and we are 
extending it east of that point about 200 feet under Hollywood Boulevard," said 
Bill Heard, an MTA spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the project said the damage to the street is nothing short of a 
catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've just been doing shoddy work," said Bob D'Amato, a member of the Los 
Angeles Transportation Whistle Blowers in Favor of Congressional Enquiry. "They 
are just in a hurry to get the work done." 
</P>
<P>
 He said his group wants the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to conduct an 
assessment of the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, you can't trust who is down there," D'Amato said. "We need an 
outside person to come in and check it out."

CHIAPAS VOTERS CONQUER FEARS TO TEST DEMOCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Early Sunday morning, the village leader here sounded an aged bull's horn 
summoning townspeople to the first elections ever held in this tiny hamlet deep 
in Zapatista rebel territory. 
</P>
<P>
 They came, scrambling over narrow, muddy paths, down hillsides covered with 
corn patches, and waited hours to cast the mysterious ballots that they hope 
will change their hardscrabble lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I voted for the Zapatistas!" said a 55-year-old woman in a floral-print dress 
as she left the makeshift polling station. Presumably, hers was a vote for the 
left, since the rebels do not appear on the paper ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 "And why not? Let's see what they can do for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Here in the cradle of Mexico's remarkable political revolution, thousands of 
Indians throughout the jungle-covered valleys and mountains of southern Chiapas 
rose before dawn and walked for miles to participate in a tense test of 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots more people voting because we want clean elections this time," 
whispered a nervous Roberto Monroyo, 30, as he stood in a long line outside a 
thatched-roof school in another Chiapas jungle village, Balboa, where votes -- 
legitimately or otherwise -- have always favored the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiapas was the scene of a New Year's Day rebellion by guerrillas of the 
Zapatista National Liberation Army, whose demands for justice and rights for 
Mexico's ignored Mayan masses resonated the world over. The uprising left 145 
people dead and irrevocably shifted a national political agenda just months 
before Sunday's crucial elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Though not much of a fighting force, the Zapatistas were able to take nominal 
control of nearly half of this backward state's sparsely populated territory. 
They quickly forced the government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari into 
peace talks that have won the rebels numerous concessions, including electoral 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Zapatista pressure, the government agreed to the highly unusual practice 
of allowing civilian activist groups to take a role in organizing and 
overseeing Sunday's elections throughout the so-called conflict zone, where 
Zapatista influence is strongest. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, the Zapatista army agreed to withdraw into distant forests to allow 
the elections to take place. The rebels had threatened to retaliate if the 
voting is rigged but now say there will be no "immediate military response" if 
fraud is evident. 
</P>
<P>
 "As unusual as it is to allow elections (with the activist groups in charge), 
it is a way to keep the peace," said a senior Mexican army officer in the 
Chiapas town of Ocosingo, one of several seized by the Zapatistas on New Year's 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual number of potential voters in the area is about 30,000 -- minuscule 
in a pool of 45.7 million nationwide. But the way the elections are carried out 
and the hope, or frustration, that peasant voters take with them will help 
determine the future strength of Mexico's political opposition, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the rhetoric and high hopes, democracy was having a few problems in 
the conflict zone Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Zapata, a town in Chiapas' southeast corner that appears on few maps, only 
about 60 people had voted by noon because of delays and confusion. Some could 
not find their names on the voter registration list, which seemed to contain 
names of people who had left long ago; others did not have their required 
voting credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Cristobal de las Casas, the second-largest city in Chiapas and one that 
was also briefly overrun by rebels Jan. 1, anger over a shortage of ballots 
triggered a raucous protest by more than 1,000 frustrated voters who filled the 
central plaza and shouted, "Fraud!" witnesses said. There, as in other parts of 
the country, a polling station designated for voters who cannot reach their 
home district ran out of ballots, stranding scores of people. The absentee 
ballots are of particular importance in Chiapas because violence has displaced 
large numbers of people from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Chiapas capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez, police fired tear gas to disperse 
several hundred people protesting a similar shortage of special ballots. Three 
people were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, military checkpoints continued to stop Mexicans, journalists and 
foreign election observers traveling into the war zone. Public transportation 
seemed nonexistent, forcing many to walk for hours to their polling stations. 
And fearing violence or renewed guerrilla attacks, scores of people abandoned 
their towns in the week leading up to the election and sought refuge in larger 
cities or refugee camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in Zapata, in other tiny villages along the San Quintin Valley and in 
larger towns on the edge of the war zone such as Ocosingo, Altamirano and San 
Miguel, initial reports indicated that voter turnout was substantial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are voting to change the government and make it democratic," said Gildardo 
Jimenez, 48, one of Zapata's first settlers, who came here in search of land 16 
years ago. "We want a government that does things for the people. The 
governments have been treating peasants like a father who abandons his children 
without food or a roof. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now we know (the government's) tricks, and if this (the election) doesn't 
work, then we have to go back to war. There will be no peace." 
</P>
<P>
 In Zapata, husbands were helping their illiterate wives vote. Filemon Gomez 
showed his wife, Elba Lucia, where to place the X for the leftist Democratic 
Revolutionary Party (PRD). As a reporter and photographer observed with 
interest, the local PRD representative rushed over to explain that Lucia and 
the other women are simply being assisted in expressing their own political 
decisions, that no one is telling them whom to vote for, simply how to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ocosingo, several thousand Indians, uniformed soldiers and other Mexican 
citizens filled the central plaza, under palm trees outside a freshly 
whitewashed Roman Catholic church, waiting to vote. Women opened umbrellas 
against the blistering sun. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at this plaza during the January uprising that five Zapatista fighters 
were found dead, shot in the head and their hands tied behind their backs, in 
what was widely reported as an incident of Mexican army abuse. A government 
investigation cleared the army of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite clear support for the PRD in Zapatista strongholds like Zapata, many 
Indian voters seemed frightened and reluctant to express their political views. 
And many, whispering among themselves in Tzeltal, simply did not understand the 
process, nor could they decipher the political party symbols on the ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, voting in Indian villages was controlled by political bosses, 
or caciques, who delivered a unanimous vote in favor of the ruling 
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). The caciques in exchange received 
perks and economic benefits from the government, which rarely trickled down 
into the village. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will vote for the PRI because my parents vote for the PRI and my (town) 
votes for the PRI," said an 18-year-old woman who gave her name as Mariana and 
who had walked for two hours from her village, Nuevo Jerusalen, to vote in the 
war-zone village of San Quintin.

 The PRI was also expected to do well among its local power base of wealthy 
ranchers and landowners, especially after the Zapatista rebellion inspired 
numerous peasant takeovers of thousands of acres of land. Chiapas history has 
been marked by violent land disputes and human rights abuses.

 "Everyone wants the security that we already know, and that security is called 
'PRI,' " said Jose Luis Coria, 47, a merchant in San Cristobal de las Casas. 
"We are not Central America, and we do not want to be."

<P>
 With the January Indian rebellion captivating the world's imagination, Chiapas 
is host now to an unusually large contingent of national and foreign observers. 
About 2,000 volunteers were making the rounds of a limited number of Chiapas 
towns and cities to help ensure clean balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 The non-governmental activist groups who, with the government's Federal 
Electoral Institute, shared responsibility for the elections in the conflict 
zone turned in a spotty performance. While they helped voting go smoothly in 
some areas, they failed to show up in others.

 "What beasts our civil servants are!"  
</P>
<P>
 -- Nikolai Gogol, "Diary of a Madman" 
</P>
<P>
 In this birthplace of V. I. Lenin, the most noxious reminder of the Communist 
past is not the giant bald statue still towering above the Volga River, or the 
ration coupons still doled out for meat and butter. It is the fact that many 
people still live in fear. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't fear the KGB, they don't fear the Communist Party; those days are 
truly gone. They fear their own local leaders, the men who hold livelihoods in 
their hands, and the petty officials with rubber stamps and metal seals who do 
their bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 "In essence, we live under an overblown form of bureaucracy," an Ulyanovsk 
businessman said. "This power is still extremely strong; it still has the 
ability to repress and control." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he asked that his name not be used, for fear his business would suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 As if the entire country didn't recognize the phenomenon he was describing at 
its most extreme. As if the president himself had not recently growled publicly 
about "nasty little officials." In the old Soviet Union, the Communist Party 
controlled nearly everything, and "the apparatus" carried out its orders. In 
the new Russia, the ideological component is gone, but the overweening power of 
officialdom remains, embodied in the bureaucratic obstacle course that even the 
simplest of transactions can often still entail, and in the nearly unchecked 
power of local bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 Where else does a woman need a note from a gynecologist confirming her 
feminine health to get a driver's license? Where else does the recipient of an 
overseas parcel end up standing in 16 different lines at the airport customs 
office to pick it up? 
</P>
<P>
 It is a more subtle affliction, this bureaucratic yoke, than the old 
monolithic Communist tyranny, but it is one of the main reasons -- in addition 
to the generalized lawlessness and old habits of thought -- why it will take 
Russia so very long to make its new society run Western-style. If it ever does. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very strong bureaucracy and a weak state," author Alexander I. 
Solzhenitsyn concluded recently after a two-month odyssey across Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Solzhenitsyn would have particularly noticed officialdom's might in the 
backwaters he passed through. The Kremlin may proclaim privatization and free 
trade and land reform, but if it then takes years to implement those decrees, 
it is because greater power than ever lies in the hands of officials "in the 
places," as Russians refer to their far-flung provinces. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the local level, there is dictatorship," said Nikolai Povtarev, former 
head of the regional council in Ulyanovsk. "If a person suddenly takes a 
different position, and, say, he's the director of an enterprise, suddenly he's 
being checked by the fire inspectors, by the tax inspectors, construction is 
frozen and so on." 
</P>
<P>
 If, during the perestroika era, the bureaucracy was blamed for "braking" 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms, now it is reviled for pursuing its own venal 
interests rather than advancing Russia's transition to a civilized free-market 
system. In the popular perception, it is slowly giving up its death grip on 
state property only in exchange for a river of bribes. 
</P>
<P>
 The main difference between the old bureaucracy and the new, said Alexei 
Golovkov, former chief of the Russian government apparatus, is that now, along 
with the simple pleasure of power, bureaucrats have a tremendous new incentive 
to keep procedures tangled and difficult: money. 
</P>
<P>
 "A class of people have appeared who are ready to pay for everything," 
Golovkov said, "and if, before, a bureaucrat had a few little privileges, now a 
normal bureaucrat can afford 10 times more than he did 10 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 The great challenge of painstakingly building a normal civil society, one in 
which people know and defend their rights, hinges in part on whether Russian 
democracy can stamp out the trait known as proizvol -- arbitrariness, rogue 
power, clout wielded irresponsibly. 
</P>
<P>
 Rooted deep in Russian life, official proizvol is perhaps best depicted in 
literature by the 19th-Century tragicomic genius Nikolai Gogol. In his classic 
story "The Overcoat," a timid clerk named Akaky Akakievich is given such a 
merciless dressing-down by an "Important Person" that the trauma, coupled with 
the loss of his overcoat, kills him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where do you think you are?" the Important Person demands of Akakievich. 
"Don't you know how things are conducted here? It's high time you knew that 
first of all your application must be handed in at the main office, then taken 
to the chief clerk, then to the departmental director, then to my secretary, 
who then submits it to me for consideration. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Soviet founder Lenin ran into what is ironically referred to here as "the 
deathless bureaucracy" when he returned to work after a four-month illness and 
found that his 16 government committees had metamorphosed into 120. 
</P>
<P>
 And President Boris N. Yeltsin has run up against a similar phenomenon. He has 
repeatedly demanded cuts in the government staff and publicly berated his 
administration chief, Vladimir Kvasov, but to little avail. The newspaper 
Kuranty disclosed this month that the Russian government is actually supporting 
an administrative machine that costs proportionately half again as much as its 
Soviet counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
 No one gives up power voluntarily, Ernst Cherny notes in the Kuranty article, 
which carries the headline, "The Official Can Devour Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 In Ulyanovsk, an aviation and agricultural region renowned as possibly the 
most Old Guard bastion in Russia, no one seems to give up power at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Local journalists and officials cite a game of political musical chairs that 
results in a permanent stasis: The former head of the regional Communist Party 
is now the regional governor; the city Communist Party head is now a deputy 
governor; a former second secretary of the city party now heads Ulyanovsk's 
biggest commercial bank; former ideology chieftains now handle the region's 
foreign economic ties (what few there are) and its pension fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the 1991 coup there was such euphoria that now there would be a new 
life," said Alexander Kuznetsov, editor of Skify, or Scythians, a business 
newspaper. "Nothing of the kind. The bureaucrats all act as they did. Only the 
ideological character is different; what was under an ideological cover before 
-- Lenin, the party -- is now revealed as pure power, pure officialdom. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last 10 years, the country has changed phenomenally," he added. "But 
as for bureaucratic principles and orders, they don't change as fast as many 
would like." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially in Ulyanovsk. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the old Soviet Union, Ulyanovsk, home to 1.5 million people, is still a 
place where you feel as if just about anything can happen to you. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrepreneur Oleg Berlent got the best restaurant in town up and running, 
doing all the renovation and investment to make the Registan a luxurious 
watering hole the likes of which Ulyanovsk had never seen. 
</P>
<P>
 And may never see again. As local journalists and politicians tell it, Berlent 
somehow got on the wrong side of the Ulyanovsk administration and was informed 
that his restaurant would have to be turned over to the local police station to 
be used in an expansion of its detention cells. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar fate befell many of the city's kiosk owners, who were suddenly 
informed last spring that they would have to relinquish their licensed spots at 
the center of town or close down. And vendors at Ulyanovsk's main "Thing 
Market" -- a flea-market-like institution common to most Russian cities -- were 
abruptly moved to a remote spot near the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there were the entrepreneurs who shipped 8 million rubles -- about $4,000 
-- worth of candy and cookies from a neighboring region, only to be told they 
would have to pay 2 million rubles for an Ulyanovsk "certificate of quality." 
They ultimately avoided the certificate, but it required a month of running 
from official to official. 
</P>
<P>
 The examples go on and on. The victims of proizvol are not totally without 
recourse. They can appeal to a new system of arbitration courts; they can sue; 
they can bribe. In the extreme, they can try to get help from Moscow reform 
chiefs, and sometimes the Kremlin will intervene, as it did when it leaned on 
recalcitrant Ulyanovsk leaders to privatize more shops and enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moscow is far away, and the real power in Ulyanovsk is Yuri Goryachev, the 
backward-looking governor who still believes universal ration coupons are the 
best defense for the poor and still makes whistle-stop tours of farm towns like 
the Communist chiefs of old. 
</P>
<P>
 When Georgy Stupnikov, Yeltsin's official representative in Ulyanovsk, calls 
Goryachev on their special government line, Goryachev often just hangs up when 
he hears Stupnikov's voice, Stupnikov said. So much for Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite repeated requests, neither Goryachev nor several top Ulyanovsk 
officials would agree to even a brief interview with The Times. So much for 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it would be unfair to say Goryachev and the Ulyanovsk apparatus resist 
reform full force. 
</P>
<P>
 Their attitude, said Kuznetsov of Skify, is: "Go ahead, own something, but you 
should know that if I decide I don't like it, I'll close you down with a decree 
or a resolution or taxes or some other way." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in his modest office, Kuznetsov, a sizable, mop-headed man with a 
friendly, bespectacled look, mused aloud: "If they shut us down tomorrow . . . 
" 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd be sad, but we wouldn't make a fuss," finished his general director, 
Nikolai Frolov. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd look for something else to open. . . ," Kuznetsov said. Like the kiosk 
owners, they would not go to court because local officials could always find 
some violation of tax laws or the building code or some other excuse to justify 
the closing. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuznetsov and Frolov, though they are natural entrepreneurs, have a long way 
to go before they can fit Yeltsin's vision of a Russia composed of "a million 
owners, instead of a few millionaires." 
</P>
<P>
 An even more disturbing product of Ulyanovsk bureaucracy is Sergei Kruglov, 
who runs a small commercial store in the center of town. The store is a 
hole-in-the-wall, with the usual shoddy mix of shoes and radios and doodads, 
and Kruglov does not plan to fix it up or expand it because he cannot own the 
space it occupies. He can only lease it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I invest money, and tomorrow they say, 'It's not yours,' " he said as a 
saleswoman looked on disapprovingly and hinted at the trouble he could get into 
for speaking out. "Why should I invest? Even if they give you something for 20 
years, they can take it away." 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Kruglov had started up a similar small store in a medical clinic, 
stocking it and investing about $300 -- then the equivalent of six months' 
salary. After two months, a decree came out prohibiting shops in "social and 
cultural buildings" such as clinics, and he was kicked out with no 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 He could have fought the officials who did it, he said, "but that means you go 
here, you go there, you may find the truth, but you'll lose your health." 
</P>
<P>
 Without basic security regarding what they own, it is hard to expect Russians 
to invest the work and money needed to make things better. And investment is 
what economists say Russia now needs most. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution, Russian politicians hope, is a new civil code that will finally 
regulate most commercial transactions and contracts, giving citizens a better 
idea of what rights they can brandish when they face overbearing bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main principles of the sacrosanct nature of private property are 
reinforced in the civil code," said Sergei Alexeyev, one of its authors and 
main advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there are plenty of pretty rights codified in Russia's new 
constitution, passed last December, but that charter has proved of little help 
in Ulyanovsk. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, believes former Russian government administration chief Golovkov, 
what will change the bureaucrats of Ulyanovsk -- and their counterparts around 
the country -- is the dawning realization that by maintaining too tight a grip, 
they are only hurting themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In a year or two, he said, Ulyanovsk bureaucrats will look at the prosperity 
of their progressive counterparts in Nizhny Novgorod or Chuvashia and 
understand that when business is allowed to flourish, the entire region can 
prosper with it. "And then they'll face a choice," Golovkov said: "to live as 
they are or to live like their neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 That may be questionable, however; former council chairman Povtarev said that 
many Ulyanovsk officials are creating "state commercial structures" that let 
them use the local government's virtual monopoly on trade, commerce and 
property to turn healthy profits for themselves. Many bureaucrats also openly 
charge exorbitant rates to give permits or licenses in a reasonable amount of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ask them, 'Tell me one thing: What jurisdiction are you, state or private?' 
" Povtarev said. " 'If you're commercial, why do you have governmental 
functions?' 
</P>
<P>
 "The apparatus is becoming an owner," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Golovkov noted that Parliament is also beginning to pass laws that take effect 
rather than act as declarations that need follow-up rulings by ministries and 
local administrations -- the spaces between the lines that allow for proizvol 
-- to come into force. 
</P>
<P>
 But chipping away at the bureaucratic empire takes time -- months, even years. 
Povtarev compared officialdom to a hydra; others call it a swamp or a virus. 
</P>
<P>
 The activists of Ulyanovsk's Anti-Bureaucratic Center, a small group of former 
anti-Communists who remain a focus of the weak anti-Goryachev opposition, 
rejoice that the Communist Party is more or less dead but see officialdom as 
the great remaining block to freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially in Ulyanovsk, with our mentality, officials will be ruling for a 
long, long time," history professor Vladimir Zerkalov said. "That it's 
accomplished its first task is a start, but I won't live to see the day that 
the Anti-Bureaucratic Center can be dissolved." 
</P>
<P>
 NEXT: How Russians are slowly mustering the independence of mind that is the 
key to real self-rule. Opening a Company, Russian-Style 
</P>
<P>
 Opening a bicycles business in Russia can mean going through a bureaucratic 
maze than can take entrepreneurs a month to five months to complete. Here are 
the steps involved in starting a business: 
</P>
<P>
 1) GATHER NECESSARY DOCUMENTS 
</P>
<P>
 Protocol Sobraniya (meeting protocol): The document confirming intention to 
start a company. It includes a list, complete with addresses, of directors and 
general director of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Ustav (charter): The document specifying what your firm will do. It's very 
lax: A limited liability company can sell bananas or build missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial Statement: A letter stating, among other things, that the firm has 
raised at least half of its founding capital. Separate documents are needed to 
certify that all applicable dues and charges have been paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Landlord guaranty letters: Three original letters from the landlord where the 
company will maintain its legal address. Also, the landlord must provide 
written proof of the right to lease the premises. Landlords often charge 
substantial fees for providing these documents, and there is sometimes more 
than one person claiming the right to lease premises. 
</P>
<P>
 2) GET TEMPORARY REGISTRATION 
</P>
<P>
 An application for must be filled out at the Registration Chamber of the 
administrative region. 
</P>
<P>
 An official will give the application and other required documents to a lawyer 
who works at the Registration Chamber. The lawyer informs the applicant what 
mistakes have been made in the documents. 
</P>
<P>
 If an error is found, a new set of documents must be made. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents are brought back to the chamber and a small fee is paid for a 
temporary registration. 
</P>
<P>
 About a week later, the Registration Chamber issues a card officially 
proclaiming the temporary registration. The applicant now has 30 days to 
complete the registration process. 
</P>
<P>
 3) GO TO POLICE 
</P>
<P>
 Permission from the local police is needed to obtain an official stamp. No 
document in Russia is considered legitimate without a stamp. 
</P>
<P>
 4) GET REGISTRATION NUMBER 
</P>
<P>
 The State Statistics Committee will issue a "code," which is like an official 
registration number of your company. They put your code in a computer 
containing the numbers of all firms. 
</P>
<P>
 5) GET STAMP 
</P>
<P>
 With permission papers from the police, a printing company will agree to make 
the company's stamp. It will take about a week to make the stamp. 
</P>
<P>
 6) NOTARIZE SIGNATURE CARD 
</P>
<P>
 To open a bank account, a signature card is needed with the signatures of all 
co-founders attested to by a notary public.  
</P>
<P>
 7) OPEN BANK ACCOUNT 
</P>
<P>
 Choose a bank and open an account.Some banks will not open an account without 
proof of a tax registration (see step 9). 
</P>
<P>
 8) REGISTER WITH PENSION FUND 
</P>
<P>
 The company must be registered with a pension fund and be given a document 
attesting to the fact that you registered. 
</P>
<P>
 9) REGISTER WITH TAX AUTHORITIES 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid tax evasion, Russia requires that all businesses register with the 
Tax Inspectorate. Also, some banks will not let you open an account without 
proof of tax registration. 
</P>
<P>
 If steps 3-9 are not completed in 30 days, the temporary registration expires 
and the company will have to go through the process again. 
</P>
<P>
 10) GET PERMANENT REGISTRATION 
</P>
<P>
 All accumulated stamps and documents must be taken back to the local 
Registration Chamber, where they are examined. If everything is in order, the 
company is issued a permanent registration certificate. 
</P>
<P>
 Congratulations. You can now sell bicycles.

HOUSE OKS CRIME BILL, KEEPS ASSAULT GUN BAN; CONGRESS: THE REVIVED MEASURE IS 
TRIMMED TO $30 BILLION. CLINTON CALLS 235-195 VOTE A 'GREAT VICTORY FOR ALL 
LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS.' BUT A GOP FILIBUSTER COULD AWAIT IN THE SENATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a roller-coaster ride to the end, President Clinton's anti-crime bill 
finally squeezed through a surly and exhausted House on Sunday night after 
Democrats made major concessions to win enough Republican votes to overcome 
fierce opposition by the gun lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Stripped of nearly a third of its spending for the social programs opposed by 
Republicans but with its ban on the sale of assault weapons intact, the 
$30-billion measure was approved, 235 to 195, after what both sides agreed was 
one of the fiercest legislative battles in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oval Office remarks shortly after the vote, President Clinton lauded 
passage of the bill as "a great victory for all law-abiding Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the way Washington ought to work, and I hope it will work this way in 
the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton praised House Republicans for helping to save the bill, saying that he 
was "very grateful" for their aid. A major victory for him, the election-year 
struggle over the crime bill had come to represent a portentous trial of the 
Democrats' ability to govern. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in a warning that at least one more hairpin curve lies ahead on the 
crime bill's tortuous legislative course, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee said that he expects Republican senators to try to filibuster the 
package when it goes to the upper chamber this week. "They will filibuster, and 
it's going to be tough, but I think we'll get enough votes to pass it," Sen. 
Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) said. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation provides for hiring as many as 100,000 police officers over 
six years, building new prisons, funding crime prevention programs, banning the 
sale of certain assault weapons, expanding the death penalty and mandating life 
in prison for three-time violent offenders. For the moment at least, the White 
House and its Democratic allies on Capitol Hill were both exultant and relieved 
that they had brought the crime bill this far with its assault weapon ban 
intact, despite tenacious opposition by the National Rifle Assn. and other gun 
lobbying groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who hate guns are in the majority right now," said House Judiciary 
Committee Chairman Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), admitting that he and about 50 other 
pro-NRA Democrats had waged an unsuccessful campaign to kill the weapon ban. 
</P>
<P>
 They almost succeeded when they joined forces Aug. 11 with Republicans to 
block the House from considering the original bill on a narrow procedural vote. 
Stunned by a defeat orchestrated in part by members of its own party, the 
Clinton Administration began negotiating with moderate Republicans, who agreed 
to support the bill after winning about $3.3 billion in spending cuts and 
stiffer penalties for some offenses in a marathon round of weekend talks ending 
early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP moderates delivered 42 votes, more than enough to allow Clinton to 
prevail, 239 to 189, on the procedural vote the second time around Sunday. But 
another hurdle loomed when opponents sought to send the bill back to the 
drafting table with instructions to incorporate alternative provisions that 
would have dropped the assault weapon ban and cut even more of the spending 
that many Republicans had derided as "pork." 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly fearful that it would be unable to hold its narrow bipartisan 
coalition together on that motion, the White House waged an eleventh-hour 
lobbying blitz. The Democratic leadership warned its members that with their 
votes rode the fate of far more than just the anti-crime bill, one of Clinton's 
legislative priorities in this election year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been telling them that, more than any other vote this year, the crime 
bill is a test of party loyalty," a senior Democratic strategist said. "We've 
been telling them that the way they vote could affect the health care debate 
and even the party's chances of retaining control of the House next year." 
</P>
<P>
 The NRA also lobbied furiously, flooding congressional offices on Sunday with 
leaflets and letters that warned members to beware of "the incredible voter 
anger brewing outside the (Washington) Beltway" and its consequences for their 
reelection efforts in November. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, however, the White House strategy worked as Clinton held on to the 
votes of 31 of the 38 members of the Congressional Black Caucus in spite of 
their opposition to the anti-crime bill's expanded death penalties and the 
steep spending cuts in crime prevention programs favored by liberal lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to attract the caucus' votes, the GOP leadership dropped the 
death penalty provisions from its alternative bill, which was hurriedly drafted 
late Saturday by Reps. Duncan Hunter (R-El Cajon) and Bill Brewster (D-Okla.). 
</P>
<P>
 But even though the Black Caucus favored the anti-crime bill itself, 24 to 11, 
most of its members stuck by the Administration on the second procedural vote 
that marked the defeat of the gun lobby and cleared the way for final passage 
of what Clinton hailed as the "toughest" anti-crime legislation ever to clear 
the House. 
</P>
<P>
 On the second vote, which both sides agreed was the key to final passage, 201 
Democrats and 30 Republicans sided with the Administration, while 51 Democrats 
and 146 Republicans voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, said Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.), was still "the most balanced 
approach to crime that this country has seen in a long time," even though the 
weight of its provisions had been shifted to "an ounce of prevention (for) a 
pound of punishment." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the compromise negotiated with the GOP moderates led by Reps. Michael N. 
Castle of Delaware and John R. Kasich of Ohio, the measure that moves to the 
Senate this week includes $30 billion in funding over six years for a broad 
array of law enforcement and crime prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Financed by a trust fund fed by the savings that are expected to accrue from 
the anticipated elimination of 270,000 federal jobs over the next few years, 
the crime bill would provide $13.45 billion to hire more police and beef up the 
budgets of law enforcement agencies, $9.85 billion for prison construction, 
$5.9 billion for prevention programs, such as midnight basketball leagues and 
other after-hours activities for troubled youths, and $1 billion to establish a 
program of alternative sentencing and treatment for drug users. 
</P>
<P>
 Other key provisions include a 10-year ban on the manufacture and sale of 19 
types of assault weapons, expansion of the death penalty to include more than 
60 federal offenses, new regulations to help protect women against stalkers and 
spousal abusers, stricter registration requirements for paroled sex offenders 
and the "three strikes and you're out" law mandating life imprisonment for 
three-time convicted felons. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the changes negotiated with the GOP moderates centered on the crime 
prevention side of the package. A $650-million youth job training program was 
eliminated while other prevention programs like midnight basketball were either 
cut by 10% or rolled into block grants. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise also permits charges of previous sex offenses to be admitted 
into evidence when accused sex offenders are tried in federal courts, requires 
police to notify communities when convicted sex offenders move into their areas 
and significantly restricts the original bill's provisions on the early parole 
of nonviolent drug offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 With the momentous floor fight over, exhausted lawmakers grabbed their bags 
and literally fled out the doors, eager to get home to their districts to begin 
a long-delayed summer recess. 
</P>
<P>
 For Clinton, the main plus was in preserving the assault weapon ban -- an 
accomplishment that allowed him to claim final victory even though he was 
forced to accept steep cuts in crime prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But his victory came after so much agony and partisan conflict that it 
appeared Pyrrhic -- confirming his tenacity as a fighter but doing little to 
erase the impression, after days of apocalyptic press coverage, that he is a 
weak President. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans, for their part, were clearly elated with their ability to 
demonstrate that Clinton no longer can ignore them, even in a Congress 
nominally controlled by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the spending cuts they negotiated allowed them to claim that they 
had made a "bad bill better," in the words of GOP Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), 
many Republicans were quietly acknowledging that the bill may have been the 
wrong issue on which to draw their own highly partisan line in the sands of 
election-year politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Upset that Clinton was upstaging them on crime -- an issue on which they 
traditionally have appeared stronger than Democrats -- the Republicans 
repeatedly attacked the bill as a pork-loaded measure that was too soft on 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Criminals need arraignment, not entertainment," said Rep. Jack Kingston 
(R-Ga.). 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, several GOP lawmakers privately voiced concerns that they had 
succeeded only in portraying themselves as partisan obstructionists and allies 
of the opponents of gun control -- an issue on which they were at odds not only 
with public opinion but many of their own mayors and governors and nearly every 
major law enforcement agency in the country. California Delegation's Votes

 Democrats not voting -- Tucker Crime Bills Compared 
</P>
<P>
 Here is how the $33.2-billion crime bill defeated by the House on a procedural 
vote Aug. 11 compares to the $30-billion legislation it passed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 CRIME PREVENTION 
</P>
<P>
 Original -- Authorizes $7.4 billion in grants to set up after-school programs 
for children, midnight sports leagues, job training and other measures. 
Includes $1.8 billion for the Violence Against Women Act, a measure featuring 
grants to reduce domestic violence and other gender-related crimes and to train 
law enforcement officials in dealing with violence against women. 
</P>
<P>
 Compromise -- Cuts $2 billion from prevention measures, with an 
across-the-board 10% reduction in all the measures and more severe cuts in 
some. It combines some individual grants into a $379.7-million block designed 
to give localities more authority in determining how the money would be spent. 
</P>
<P>
 DEATH PENALTY 
</P>
<P>
 Original -- Extends the death penalty to more than 50 newly created or 
existing federal offenses, such as treason, drive-by shootings and murder of a 
federal law enforcement official. 
</P>
<P>
 Compromise -- Same. 
</P>
<P>
 ASSAULT WEAPONS 
</P>
<P>
 Original -- Bans manufacture of 19 named military-style assault weapons and 
"copycat" models and ammunition magazines with more than 10 rounds. Prohibits 
sale of firearms to anyone subject to a family violence restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
 Compromise -- Same. 
</P>
<P>
 PRISONS 
</P>
<P>
 Original -- Authorizes $8.3 billion for construction of prisons and boot 
camps. Of that money, 60% would go to states that demonstrate improvement in 
making violent criminals serve long sentences. The remaining 40% would be set 
aside for states that adopt truth-in-sentencing laws, which can mandate that a 
certain percentage of a sentence must be served. 
</P>
<P>
 Compromise -- Authorizes $9.8 billion for prison construction and boot camps. 
Of those funds, 50% would go to states that have already passed 
truth-in-sentencing laws, while the remaining half would be used on a 
discretionary basis. Most of those funds would be distributed to the states 
according to a government formula. 
</P>
<P>
 POLICE HIRING 
</P>
<P>
 Original -- Authorizes $10.7 billion for state and local law enforcement, 
including $8.8 billion to hire 100,000 new police officers over six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Compromise -- Authorizes $13.45 billion to hire more police and beef up the 
budgets of law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 TRUST FUND 
</P>
<P>
 Original -- Most of the bill would be financed by a $30-billion trust fund 
made up of money saved by the White House's "reinventing government" 
initiative, which is designed to reduce bureaucracy. About $3 billion would 
come from tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Compromise -- The legislation's programs would be paid for solely by the trust 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
 SEXUAL OFFENDERS 
</P>
<P>
 Original -- The names of sexual predators -- people who commit sex crimes 
against children or adults -- must be registered with law enforcement agencies 
for 10 years, subject to annual verification. 
</P>
<P>
 Compromise -- Sexual predators must be registered for 10 years, subject to 
annual verification. Some sexual predators involved in more violent acts must 
be registered permanently and would be subject to quarterly reporting. The rule 
also provides for notifying communities that a sexual predator lives in or is 
moving to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES 
</P>
<P>
 Original -- The legislation exempted retroactively some nonviolent, first-time 
drug offenders from federal mandatory minimum sentences of five and 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Compromise -- Limits the retroactivity of the exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
 ADDED PROVISIONS 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise legislation includes some measures not in the original bill, 
including new rules of evidence, such as allowing admission of prior sex 
offenses as evidence at trial, effective after a five-month review by a panel 
of federal judges. If the judges approve the change, it would become effective 
30 days afterward. If they do not approve, it would become effective in five 
months unless Congress acts to block it.

CUBAN BLOCKADE SUGGESTED IF FLOW OF REFUGEES PERSISTS; IMMIGRATION: PANETTA 
HINTS AT STRONGER MEASURES AS EXODUS CONTINUES. GUANTANAMO DETENTION CAMP 
FILLING UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta said Sunday that the Clinton 
Administration would consider imposing a blockade of Cuba if measures adopted 
in the past few days fail to stop the exodus of refugees from the island. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's obviously one of the options that we would look at in the future as we 
see whether or not Castro begins to make some legitimate movement toward 
democracy," Panetta said on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
 The vague talk of a blockade came as Administration officials appeared to be 
increasingly worried about the consequences of a continuing flood of Cubans 
leaving the island. "The outflow does not appear to be slowing," one White 
House official acknowledged Sunday. "It's going to take a few days to have it 
sink in (to Cubans) that after 30 years, you can no longer come to the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the changes announced by President Clinton on Friday, Cuban refugees, 
who in the past were admitted without question into the United States, are now 
being picked up at sea, kept out of this country and taken to the Navy base at 
Guantanamo, Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the new curbs, hundreds of Cubans attempting to make their way to 
America were again plucked out of the Florida Straits by the U.S. Coast Guard 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Guard officials in Key West, Fla., said at least 1,058 were picked up 
Sunday. On Saturday, 1,189 refugees were picked up, the most in a single day 
since 1980, when 125,000 Cubans sailed to Florida in five months during the 
Mariel boat lift. 
</P>
<P>
 The unabated exodus raises the prospect that Guantanamo -- which is already 
housing Haitian refugees -- will soon be filled with more Cubans than it can 
handle. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past few days, the Administration has been quietly searching for 
other countries in the Caribbean willing to accept some of the Cuban refugees. 
But so far it has not been able to find any nation willing to say publicly that 
it will take some of the Cubans. "We are making progress, and we hope to have 
something to announce within the week," insisted one U.S. official. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thrust here is to try to demagnetize, obviously, the flow of 
refugees that are coming toward this country," Panetta said in the ABC 
interview. "We were successful in doing that with the Haitian refugees. It took 
about a week to get the message across. Hopefully, we'll be successful in doing 
this with the Cubans." 
</P>
<P>
 Later Sunday, White House officials sought to downplay the importance of 
Panetta's comments about a blockade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he was foreshadowing anything," one Administration official 
told The Times. "I don't know of any discussions about a blockade." Another 
Administration official said Panetta's remarks were merely "a theoretical 
answer to a hypothetical question. . . . It does not reflect any ongoing 
planning or options under discussion." 
</P>
<P>
 Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles, whose personal intervention with the President 
last week helped prompt the changes in U.S. policy toward the Cuban refugees, 
said on Sunday that he would favor a blockade of Cuba if nothing else works. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Castro continues to escalate, continues to push the rafters out, other 
steps could follow. That's the feeling I get," said the Democratic governor, 
who met with Clinton in Washington on Saturday. ". . . I think the next one 
would be a blockade." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Solis, the vice director of the Transit Center for Cuban Refugees, 
which has served as a way station for rafters who made it to the United States 
over the last two years, applauded the idea of a blockade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that after 35 years, the best thing to do is to take a strong stand 
against Castro's tyranny," he said. "The conditions in Cuba are right. If they 
really enforce the blockade, Cuba will be free soon. We've been waiting for 
this for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials have justified the tougher immigration policy, in 
part, as a means of increasing the political pressure on Castro inside Cuba. 
The hope is that those who are forced to stay behind will work for political 
change on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past few years, the U.S. government has developed a classified 
contingency plan, called Operation Distant Shore, to stop a massive flow of 
refugees from Cuba to Florida, and this plan includes a naval blockade of the 
island. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate the idea of people being picked up in boats," Moynihan said. ". . . 
Listen, those camps in Guantanamo are not going to be pretty." 
</P>
<P>
 Solis' group and other Cuban Americans say they are worried that the Coast 
Guard may be ill-equipped to save the hundreds of Cubans in the Straits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are desperate about them," he said. "We know that while hundreds are being 
saved by the Coast Guard, many more are dying in the Florida Straits. They 
don't have enough ships or manpower to save everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to those brought to Guantanamo, at least one raft with a man, 
woman and child aboard made it all the way to Key West, and dozens more Cubans 
landed in the United States on cruise or cargo ships that had picked them up at 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
 These refugees were taken to the Immigration and Naturalization Service's 
Krome Detention Center near Miami, where they are being held indefinitely, 
according to Amy Otten, a spokeswoman for the INS in Miami. In all, there were 
408 men, women and children at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "They might have a better chance eventually of staying in America" than their 
fellow refugees who are being taken to Guantanamo, Otten said, "although we are 
holding them in detention indefinitely, they may be able to claim asylum 
later." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to tell what will happen to any individual," she added. "A lot 
of these decisions are being considered at the highest level and have not yet 
been made." 
</P>
<P>
 Families of the refugees were able to visit them Sunday. The women and 
children were staying in dormitories and the men in tents at the facility. 
</P>

COLUMN ONE; MIAMI HAS WARY EYE ON CASTRO; THE REFUGEE CRISIS SHOWS AGAIN THAT 
THE CUBAN COMMUNITY HAS NOT ESCAPED HIS SHADOW. TIGHTENING OF U.S. POLICY 
SPARKS HOPE, FEAR AND CONFUSION AS CITY AWAITS HIS NEXT MOVE.

<P>
 They rightly talk here about the talcum-soft sand of the endless beachfront 
and the creamy-colored buildings that line the boulevards like so many 
multitiered birthday cakes. Hurricanes have come ashore dead-on, flattening 
huge neighborhoods in a single hour of bluster. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing -- not the landscape nor the architecture nor the natural 
disasters -- has shaped the character of this city more than a bearded old 
buzzard who has not set foot here in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami is Fidel Castro's communist revolution turned inside out, the capital of 
a Cuban diaspora that has managed to turn a dowdy, one-season tourist town into 
a U.S. gateway for Latin American profit-making. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami and Havana stare at each other across the Florida Straits -- Cubans 
here, Cubans there -- one heart with two opposing brains. As if in some bizarre 
time warp, the Cold War lives on in the moist, subtropical air. 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely has this been more true than in the past two weeks. Castro has once 
again opened the exits for his disenchanted, allowing thousands to flee the 
island in makeshift vessels. Some of the tiny craft are no more than a wooden 
plank atop two inner tubes strung together with twine. The impromptu sailors 
aboard them have come to be called balseros , or the rafters. 
</P>
<P>
 Their haphazard crossing presents too chaotic an exodus for America's orderly 
immigration policy. This is very much as Castro wants it. For a generation, the 
United States has tried to choke his revolution with a trade embargo. He owes 
Uncle Sam no favors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the resulting havoc, President Clinton has issued an extraordinary decree. 
Arriving Cubans will no longer enjoy the special status that long has given 
them automatic asylum. In fact, the U.S. Coast Guard now intercepts the 
balseros and delivers them to Guantanamo, the U.S. naval base in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's decision is a source of trauma and confusion for the 560,000 Cuban 
Americans in Miami, so ready to welcome their freedom-seeking brethren, so 
cautious about the tricks of a wily nemesis that many here mythologize. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wait and see, Castro will outsmart Clinton," said Rafael Penalver, a Miami 
attorney and Cuban activist. "This has all been a Castro show designed to get 
Clinton to the negotiating table and toss Fidel a lifeline. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within a few weeks, Castro will announce some meaningless elections. It will 
tempt Clinton with a chance to look tough and claim a victory, as if he stopped 
the exodus and led Cuba down the path to democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no evidence to support such a theory, but this grand theme of a sly, 
all-powerful Fidel recurs here always, constant as the palm fronds and the 
palmetto bugs. Castro, the evil genius. Castro, history's great survivor. 
</P>
<P>
 It is presumed that U.S. presidents are no match for him. The inexperienced 
John F. Kennedy is still blamed for failing to support a refugee brigade with 
air power during the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. For a time, Ronald Reagan 
was singularly thought to be Fidel's equal. Cubans here called him El Machaso 
-- the great macho. But Reagan came and went and Castro remained. 
</P>
<P>
 So what is crafty Fidel up to this time, with the balseros ? Cubans here do 
not want a repeat of 1980. Back then, Castro opened the Mariel harbor. Miami's 
exiles rushed over there in boats, ferrying some 125,000 new refugees away in a 
ragtag armada of skiffs, racing sloops, sailboats and shrimpers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the simplicity of that exultant spring, the armada was called the "freedom 
flotilla." In a flurry of affection, the refugees were dubbed the Marielitos . 
</P>
<P>
 But, slowly, Castro's trick became apparent. Along with the poor, huddled 
masses he had sent a few thousand criminals. The poor needed schools, shelter 
and medical care. The criminals required guns, drugs and victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami's earlier Cubans had come to pride themselves on their 
up-by-the-bootstraps prosperity. They had been model citizens. Suddenly, with 
the Marielitos , Miami was the host city to an en masse Cuban prison break. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people from Mariel were also generally darker-skinned and not so 
well-dressed and not so well-educated," said Arturo Villar, who does market 
studies specializing in Cuba. "There was a negative reaction." 
</P>
<P>
 The endearing term Marielito was soon used as a slur. So, these past few 
weeks, with hundreds of Cubans arriving on rafts, local concerns were obvious. 
How many balseros were coming? And just who was it that Fidel was sending? 
</P>
<P>
 As these latest refugees were plucked from the sea, it was hard to greet them 
with anything but admiration. They had cast their fates to the Gulf Stream in 
perilous journeys that had taken one to 10 days. They emerged gaunt and 
sun-dried, their skin cracked with sores and burns. They looked like human salt 
sticks, their bodies stiff from hanging on as they bobbed. 
</P>
<P>
 One 8-year-old boy, Daniel Bussot, was rescued alone, clinging to a piece of 
wood. A squall had swamped his boat just after his mother gave him the only 
life jacket aboard. His parents died in the cruel pitch of the waves. "I 
hollered for my mom and dad, and they didn't turn up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adis Sedeno, a 22-year-old mother, told a common story after seven days at 
sea. "Imagine what it is like now in Cuba," she said of the reasons for risking 
her life. "Medical care, clothing, food -- there is nothing there. There is 
nothing of everything." 
</P>
<P>
 In her arms was her 1-year-old, Gustavo Antonio, his buttocks blistered with 
sunburn. "There were 29 of us, seven of them children. We had to breathe the 
fumes from the motor. Everyone was vomiting all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremias Rangel, 24, set out with nine others. It was their seventh attempt to 
leave. On earlier tries, their rafts broke apart in the surf. Eventually, they 
launched from a swampy, mosquito-infested spit of coastline. Rangel's wife was 
left behind. He thought she should wait for a better boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, under Clinton's new policy, it is unclear if she can ever come to 
America. He phoned her from a friend's house, west of Miami. Her father 
answered. "Forgive me for leaving her," pleaded Rangel, a tall, angular man 
with a sharp chin. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife got on. "I'll do anything to get there," she said in sobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, don't jump on just any boat!" 
</P>
<P>
 "I will!" 
</P>
<P>
 "No, if God wills it, we'll see each other soon." 
</P>
<P>
 The connection was impossibly bad. The phone clicked silent after three 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 With the telling of each remarkable, wrenching tale, the complicated feelings 
of Miami's Cubans grow ever more addled. One emotion leapfrogs another. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the more recent arrivals, such as the Marielitos , demand outright 
acceptance of the balseros , the more the merrier. They are likelier to have 
relatives among the rafters. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Cubans, on the other hand, suggest it is better for the balseros to stay 
on the island. They say that if the end of Castro's 35-year-old regime is in 
sight, the disaffected could speed his downfall as foot soldiers in a 
counterrevolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, that is an immoral position, easy to propose by Cubans here who 
are comfortable and well-fed," said Maria Christina Herrera, an outspoken 
college professor in Miami. "Let them live there and say it." 
</P>
<P>
 By the nose-counting of pollsters, the majority of Miami residents agree with 
Clinton's new Cuban refugee policy. It has the support of city and state 
officials, as well as the benediction of the Cuban American National 
Foundation, a powerful lobbying group whose chairman, Jorge Mas Canosa, has 
commended himself as a fitting successor to Fidel. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, nearly all Cubans blanch at the idea of fugitives from Castro 
being held behind barbed wire in U.S. custody. Some balseros have already been 
taken to the Krome Detention Center, at the edge of the Everglades. They were 
photographed in familiar orange jumpsuits as protesters rallied at the gate. 
Thousands of others will doubtlessly end up at Guantanamo. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of treatment most commonly has been observed here with Haitian 
refugees, themselves desperate, impoverished boat people, nearly 15,000 of whom 
have been amassed at Guantanamo since July 5. Last week, mobs of the frustrated 
detainees pelted their U.S. guards with rocks and bed frames. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitians' dilemma has never been a great passion of Miami's Cubans. In 
fact, the idea of the two refugee groups detained together summons some deep 
prejudices. "We don't want our people in Guantanamo with a bunch of Haitians 
who are full of AIDS," said Juan Lopez, 23, who came on the Mariel boat lift. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, the mingling of the two refugee groups also has provided Cuban 
Americans with a kind of middle ground, a way to agree with the President's new 
policy and to condemn it at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Clinton wants to treat Cubans like Haitians, then let's equate the entire 
situation," said Julio Sanchez, a truck driver. "He should get the United 
Nations to blockade Cuba, just like with Haiti, and he should threaten to 
invade unless Castro steps down." 
</P>
<P>
 That sentiment has been repeated time and again at small demonstrations around 
the city. A petition is being circulated along Calle Ocho, the main street 
through the neighborhood known as Little Havana. Protesters gather near a 
memorial for those refugees killed at the Bay of Pigs. 
</P>
<P>
 On some handmade signs, the 'C' in Clinton is represented with a hammer and 
sickle. Hunger strikers have forsworn any sustenance but cigarettes and Cuban 
coffee. Children chant, " Cuba si, Castro no !" A woman with a candle strays 
down the street and lights it before a statue of the Blessed Mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Every so often, the crowd of 75 blocks traffic for five minutes or so. Drivers 
do not seem to mind. "We are all balseros ," one of them, Julio Cesar, said 
with considerable statesmanship, as if announcing: "Ich bin ein Berliner. " 
</P>
<P>
 Once, late in the day, the crowd began to argue about which flag -- America's 
or Cuba's -- ought to be flown higher. It was an interesting question. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you this," said Manuel Coll, at age 60 a pot-bellied, overheated 
man. "If Clinton gets rid of Castro, I guarantee you that Miami will turn 
American again. We Cubans will all go back." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, surveys show that only 5% to 10% would return for good. Cuban roots 
have sunk deep in Miami. A generation has grown up with memories of Super Bowls 
and Bruce Springsteen and suburban malls. 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, Havana had been like Miami's older half-brother, a place of 
rumbas and rum, gambling and sin, where a guy like Sky Masterson could bring a 
doll for a torrid weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Havana is austere, hungry, wanting: a pitiable, woebegone relative. 
Miami is flush and glamorous, with foreign tourists poking their toes in the 
ocean and fashion models posing under the street lamps. 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos are in the majority here, with the percentage going up. Slightly more 
than half of the nation's Cuban Americans live in greater Miami, according to 
Thomas Boswell, a geographer at the University of Miami. Cuban Americans make 
up 39% of the city's population of 350,000, according to the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Latinos flock here as well. There are 74,000 Nicaraguans, 69,000 Puerto 
Ricans, 54,000 Colombians, 23,000 Dominicans, 23,000 Mexicans. Of late, these 
other groups have been arriving the fastest. In 1970, 83% of Dade County's 
Latino population was Cuban; in 1990, it was 59%. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the Cuban Americans who wield the power, in business and culture and 
politics. They have three representatives in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Well-established now, their community has had time to mature. A younger 
generation is not as scarred by exile, as torn between worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 Extremism in the defense of libertad is now a vice. Moderation has begun to 
emerge. It is even possible to urge negotiations with Castro without fear of 
violent reprisal. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so few communist countries left, and the U.S. has come to terms 
with the others, why not Cuba?" said Herrera. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, her home was bombed after she made similar statements. Such 
intolerance was once the practice. In 1976, a car bomb blew off the legs of 
popular radio newscaster Emilio Milian. He had dared to criticize anti-Castro 
terrorist bombings that had swept the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, and again in 1982, bombs blasted through the walls of a cigar factory 
owned by Orlando Padron, who had earlier visited Cuba to negotiate the release 
of political prisoners. The cigar maker was photographed handing a stogie to 
Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 Such memories seem somehow distant now, from some blurry time when communism 
was fully potent and red predators appeared to be nibbling at the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still limits, however. And there always will be as long as Castro 
stays in power. In April, Miami lawyer Magda Montiel Davis went to Havana, 
attending a three-day conference called Emigration and the Nation. On a widely 
circulated videotape, she is shown at a reception greeting Castro with a kiss 
on the cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, back here, her life was threatened. Crowds gathered outside her 
home in protest. Six secretaries at her firm -- all Latinas -- quit in protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Some things remain unforgivable, like kissing that demon Fidel, the face that 
launched a thousand rafts.

MILLIONS OF MEXICANS TAKE HOPES TO POLLS; ELECTION: NEAR-RECORD NUMBERS TURN 
OUT FOR WATERSHED BALLOTING. VOTE IS PEACEFUL. EXIT SURVEYS FAVOR ZEDILLO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Early unofficial returns and preliminary exit-poll projections today gave 
Mexico's ruling party presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo a wide lead in 
crucial national elections Sunday that were billed as a watershed of Mexican 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition candidates challenged the early results after a day in which tens 
of millions of Mexicans discarded their suspicions and fears in favor of hope 
and poured into polling stations in record numbers. One of Zedillo's leading 
opponents, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, called for a mass demonstration in the heart of 
Mexico City at noon today to "make an intransigent defense of the citizens' 
vote." 
</P>
<P>
 But Zedillo's other principal challenger, conservative candidate Diego 
Fernandez de Cevallos, struck a more conciliatory tone in a speech televised 
just after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Change has barely begun, but it has begun," he declared, stressing that he 
will wait to make any declaration on the result until after the newly elected 
Congress and an official election tribunal rule on the outcome of the polls. 
"Even though the system resists dying, it is virtually dead." 
</P>
<P>
 The figures that appeared to bolster the chances of the party that has 
governed Mexico for the past 65 years came in the form of untested quick counts 
and exit polls released well in advance of official election returns. 
</P>
<P>
 The quick counts that were made public after midnight under an agreement with 
the official election commission, which had yet to announce any official 
results, indicated that Zedillo and his governing Institutional Revolutionary 
Party (PRI) would win with about 50% of the vote over about 26% for Fernandez 
and 18% for Cardenas. 
</P>
<P>
 Those tallies were based on actual returns reported unofficially to various 
groups from a random selection of polling places throughout the country. They 
came on the heels of two exit polls that projected Zedillo would win by similar 
margins. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-place Cardenas denounced the polls and quick counts as "part of the 
montage to condition public opinion" at a news conference soon after they were 
released, and the candidate of the Democratic Revolutionary Party released his 
own exit poll that showed him winning with 38% of the vote, Zedillo with 32% 
and Fernandez with 22%. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first election in which the government has permitted quick counts 
and exit polls, and several analysts said they were as unproven as the opinion 
polls that showed Zedillo far ahead 10 days before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 The national election commission had announced that its first official returns 
from the crucial poll for a new president and a 628-seat National Congress 
would be made public only after they tallied at least 15% of the vote, which 
was not expected until early this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, all three major parties, including the long-governing PRI, appeared 
to agree in the early morning hours on just one major result of Mexico's 
historic election day: Voter turnout appeared huge, with long lines snaking 
through suburban neighborhoods, slums, rural towns and jungle villages. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez's National Action Party unofficially placed the turnout nationwide 
at 75%, and ruling party sources confirmed that they believed the vote would be 
a record. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been amazed by the enormous participation, which is unprecedented in 
Mexican history," said Salvador Ordaz Montes de Ochoa, director of the National 
Assn. of Election Observers, one of several umbrella groups that fielded tens 
of thousands of Mexican poll watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts had speculated that a large turnout would probably favor the two 
leading opponents of Zedillo. But the 42-year-old Yale-educated Zedillo, 
meeting a handful of American journalists in his campaign office as the polls 
closed, said the turnout favored his governing party. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like it helped us a lot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The balloting was largely peaceful, although there were persistent reports 
throughout the day of potentially serious irregularities. In particular, there 
were severe shortages of ballots at special polling places set up for 
registered voters who were away from their home districts. 
</P>
<P>
 But many voters with credentials whose names did not appear on the official 
voters list, which the government touted as a $730-million investment in clean 
elections, also were sent to the special polling stations, some of which ran 
out of ballots before noon. 
</P>
<P>
 In other cases, citizens watchdog groups reported that polling places opened 
hours late, particularly in the state of Yucatan, a stronghold of the 
opposition National Action Party. In Michoacan, the stronghold of the other 
major opposition, the Revolutionary Democratic Party, observers saw several 
cases of "taco" voting, when a voter slips one ballot inside another, then 
stuffs both into the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear whether the irregularities would affect the final tally, and 
none of the nine political parties nor the many election observers reported 
systematic or massive fraud before the counting began Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Party officials and the two leading opposition candidates added, however, that 
they planned to watch closely as the ballots were counted through the night. 
"Up to now, my only certainty is I'm voting," said Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, 
candidate of the conservative National Action Party (PAN), grinning and puffing 
on a cigar as he prepared to vote in one of Mexico City's wealthiest 
neighborhoods. "Later in the night, we will have an opportunity to assess it." 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles away in the middle-class neighborhood of Polanco, Cardenas of the 
left-leaning Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) had a similar view. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll see what happens during the night," he told scores of journalists who 
mobbed him during the half-block walk from his high-rise apartment building to 
the local polling station. After he cast his ballot, Cardenas told reporters he 
didn't vote for himself. As a symbolic gesture he cast a write-in vote for 
Rosario Ibarra de Piedra, a veteran human rights activist and a symbol of the 
populist struggle for democracy in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas overwhelmingly won the vote in Mexico City during the last 
presidential elections in 1988 -- taking 60 of its 66 districts -- and many of 
his supporters believe he won nationwide as well. They contend he was cheated 
out of the presidency through massive fraud after the government's central 
computers crashed while tabulating the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the ruling party victor in those 
elections, has sponsored a wide array of political reforms and spent $2 billion 
on new electoral safeguards that he has promised will make Sunday's poll 
Mexico's cleanest, fairest and most transparent this century. 
</P>
<P>
 Many voters appeared to share Salinas' optimism in interviews at dozens of 
polling stations throughout Mexico -- from the Tijuana site of the March 
assassination of PRI candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, to the southern rain 
forest in Chiapas, site of a guerrilla uprising in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Many voters who said they supported opposition candidates also said they 
expected Zedillo to win. Several cited the ruling party's vast electoral 
machine nationwide. Others said they did expect fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Zedillo will win because the PRI has worked on so many campaigns," 
said 61-year-old Leobardo Navarro, who arrived from Chicago just in time to 
cast a ballot he hopes will bring change. "The change, I'm afraid, will have to 
come from inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, most voters' hopes were tempered by the history of fraud and 
corruption by the ruling party -- especially in Mexico's countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 A National Action Party official in Baja said bluntly, "It is in the hands of 
the dinosaurs (the PRI old guard). If they realize that things have changed, 
then things will be OK. If they think they can get away with what they have 
done in the past, then this is going to be a real mess." 
</P>
<P>
 In the mountainous state of Guerrero, where extreme poverty and rumors of 
guerrilla movements abound, seven truckloads of soldiers took up positions in 
the hills above the town of Tototepec on Saturday night. As in most areas of 
the country, turnout there was high but the mood tense. 
</P>
<P>
 In the district capital of Tlapa, anti-riot police were out in force, and 
Cardenas supporters said they were accumulating reports of irregularities. But 
local PRD leaders said they had not decided whether to formally protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Early, unscientific returns from three polling stations in the heart of Tlapa 
appeared to confirm Merino's assessment. There, counting ended early in the 
evening and showed the ruling party with a 3-to-1 edge over Cardenas' 
second-place PRD. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of Tlapa's chapter of the Civic Alliance, an activist organization 
that has fielded election observers nationwide, summed up the feelings of many 
in Mexico's countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ideal result for us would be for the voting to be clean and for people to 
accept it," said Joaquin Flores. "But I guess that's a little utopian." 
</P>
<P>
 Times researcher Susan Drummet in Mexico City and special correspondent Joel 
Simon in Guerrero contributed to this report.

CURBSIDE LABORERS STILL IN BUSINESS DESPITE ORDINANCE; POLICY: D.A. CAN'T 
AFFORD MANPOWER TO ENFORCE LAW THAT APPLIES TO UNINCORPORATED AREAS OF THE 
COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly seven weeks after the enactment of a county law criminalizing curbside 
job solicitation, no day laborers or employers have been arrested, and groups 
of job seekers continue to gather on street corners throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it is likely that no one will ever be prosecuted, largely because 
Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti openly refuses to devote limited resources to charging 
violators. But in some parts of the county, the mere threat of prosecution -- 
however remote -- appears to be at least temporarily deterring potential 
employers from hiring day laborers and pressuring job seekers to move 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, enacted July 1, makes curbside job seeking in unincorporated areas a 
misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and/or a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar 3-year-old Agoura Hills ordinance -- the model for the countywide 
law -- has been so ineffective that city officials have given up on enforcing 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Ladera Heights and La Mirada, sheriff's deputies are distributing 
written warnings about the county ordinance to job seekers and potential 
employers, a strategy that seems to scare both parties away, at least as long 
as deputies are on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's be candid here," said Lt. Gary Schoeller, commanding officer of the 
Marina del Rey Sheriff's Station, which patrols Ladera Heights. "We're not 
going to fix the day-laborer problem or illegal immigration with this law. At 
best, all we can hope for is to move it to another location." 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming that result is achievable, it could satisfy those homeowners who 
regard throngs of day laborers as unsightly. But the tactic could land the 
Sheriff's Department in court because the American Civil Liberties Union and 
immigrants-rights groups consider it illegal harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal battle has been playing out regularly on street corners and in front 
of home-repair stores in some unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 At Home Base in the Ladera Heights neighborhood north of Inglewood, four 
sheriff's officials spent part of one morning last week warning shoppers about 
the ordinance and videotaping day laborers. The purpose of the tape, they said, 
was to frighten off the workers and document the deputies' innocence in case 
laborers allege in court that they were manhandled. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of six day laborers approached Sgt. Homer Castille to complain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to work to feed our families," said Juan Carlos Ruiz."With a lot of 
cops here, the contractors don't stop." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the point," Castille said. "Maybe it's best if you find another place 
to find a job. I sympathize with your plight, but the way we interpret the 
ordinance, any time you solicit for work is a violation."  
</P>
<P>
 "You don't understand the ordinance," Ruiz said. "We're staying." 
</P>
<P>
 "Then we'll be seeing a lot of each other," Castille said. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Mike Antonovich and other opponents of illegal immigration 
envisioned a different result when they championed the law in the spring. They 
proclaimed that it would rid neighborhoods of day laborers and even stem the 
influx of undocumented workers into Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "This empowers the community to protect itself and its public rights of way," 
Antonovich said on May 24, when the Board of Supervisors approved the ordinance 
3 to 1. "And it eliminates the incentive for people to break the law by coming 
to this country to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration 
Reform: "If the federal government won't do its job and control its borders, 
we'll have to do it on the local level." 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich still defends the law, blaming its shortcomings on Garcetti's 
refusal to enforce it. The supervisors cannot force Garcetti to uphold the law 
because he is an elected official, leaving it up to voters to register their 
dissatisfaction at the polls, Antonovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti, who declined to comment on the issue last week, had said in the past 
that he would not enforce the new ordinance but would continue to prosecute day 
laborers who violate previously existing laws, such as that forbidding public 
urination. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have limited resources," he said in May. "Not only that, but it would be 
difficult for me to prosecute someone for simply trying to get a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti's stance has drawn the anger of the Ladera Heights Civic Assn., whose 
protests about day laborers helped fuel the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day-laborer situation is the same as it was, or worse," said Ronnie 
Cooper, the group's president. But the group is withholding judgment on the 
merits of the law in hopes that the sheriff's leaflet campaign will work. 
</P>
<P>
 The demand for day laborers' services works against the enforcement effort. 
Even as deputies issued the written warnings last week, some customers of the 
fast-food restaurant next to Home Base were defiant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see anything wrong with the day laborers here. At least they're out 
to make an honest buck, not stealing," said Irvin J. Lynch, a computer company 
manager who lives nearby. "I use them quite frequently." 
</P>
<P>
 In Agoura Hills, residents say their local ordinance has proved to be a paper 
tiger. Day laborers now congregate in slightly fewer numbers at the corner of 
Agoura and Kanan roads but only because competition has forced them to gather 
at four additional sites in the city of 20,300 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're disappointed in the law," said Darlene McBane, a former councilwoman 
and staunch supporter of the ordinance. "It certainly hasn't done a whole lot." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the city blamed a day laborer's death on the traffic disruption 
caused by men rushing up to vehicles and contended that a law prohibiting 
curbside job solicitation was needed to prevent additional accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 In a compromise, the city also set up a telephone job bank to help day 
laborers find jobs, but the service has barely been used, linking only seven to 
15 day laborers a week with employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies cited about 50 day laborers and employers in August, 1991, 
the first month after the law was enacted. But even before Garcetti was 
elected, the district attorney's office had refused to file any charges, said 
Lt. Jim Pierson of the Lost Hills/Malibu Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 "The D.A. looked at it like a vice operation and said we have to actually hear 
the solicitation to make a case," Pierson said. "Another option would be to put 
an undercover officer out there, but . . . it comes down to resources, among 
other things." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the ACLU and immigrants-rights groups sued, arguing that the law 
violated the constitutional rights to speech, assembly and travel. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, the 2nd District Court of Appeal ruled that the city has the right 
to regulate the activity of day laborers as it relates to local traffic safety 
standards. Buoyed by Agoura Hills' victory in court, the county adopted a 
similar ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 But the victory was a hollow one for Agoura Hills because of the district 
attorney's stance and the difficulty of proving that solicitation occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they'd give us a law that works, we'd use it," Pierson said. "The Board of 
Supervisors pacified the (Ladera Heights) neighbors when they passed this law, 
but that's all they did."

A TRANSFORMED LIFE SETS AN EXAMPLE; YOUTH: ONCE A GANGBANGER HERSELF, A PARK 
DIRECTOR BRINGS PROGRAMS, ENERGY, GUIDANCE AND CARING TO ONE OF VENTURA'S 
ROUGHEST NEIGHBORHOODS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Some have spent time in juvenile hall. Others have a reputation around the 
neighborhood for smooth talking and fast living, experimenting with gang life 
and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Many make some adults nervous because of the colorful street slang they use 
and the baggy jeans they wear. 
</P>
<P>
 Life can be tough for many of them. And when it gets tough, the tough kids who 
live around Ventura Avenue go to Roberta. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberta Payan, director of a community park in one of Ventura's roughest 
neighborhoods and a city expert on gang prevention, knows how to talk to the 
"homies" because she was once one herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Mouth going a mile a minute, moods swinging faster than a second hand rounds a 
clock, Payan spends her days on the harsh streets where she grew up, 
representing the authority she devoted her teen-age years to trying to defy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to make a dent with these kids, you've got to go out on the 
streets and talk to them," she said one breezy afternoon, the "Do Not Disturb" 
sign on her office door all that stood between her and the ever-pressing deluge 
of adolescent visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if you don't deal with these kids now, they will deal with you later." 
</P>
<P>
 Payan, 38, presides over her corner of the Ventura Avenue neighborhood from a 
cluttered office at Westpark Recreational Center. Outside her door, men play 
basketball in the gym, children screech in laughter as they barrel down the 
playground slide, and part-time staff aides dart back and forth, organizing 
daily programs and keeping a watch on neighborhood troublemakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Children and teen-agers constantly barge in on Payan as she tries to get 
through her work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, Roberta, got change for a $20?" one asks, as Payan scrounges through her 
purse. "I want to buy a Coke from the machine." 
</P>
<P>
 "Roberta, my boyfriend's in trouble, and I don't know what to do," cries 
another, pulling up a chair by her desk. 
</P>
<P>
 The older teen-agers and adults who grew up in the neighborhood say the park 
wasn't always such a community hub. 
</P>
<P>
 Lydia Lovio, 22, a native of the neighborhood, said Payan transformed a sleepy 
recreational center into a buzzing, bustling local hangout when she started as 
director in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, it was like: 'OK, we offer this, this and this. If you want to do it, 
fine,' " said Lovio, who joined the center staff one month after Payan. "But 
when she started, it was like a tidal wave of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 The staff -- Payan and a cluster of part-time workers -- initiated Friday 
night movies for the teen-agers who might otherwise hang out curbside and stir 
up trouble. They helped organize a boxing club and arranged a counseling 
program for troubled families. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd do anything we could to keep kids here and keep them busy," said Lovio, 
who works at the center part-time. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of all her other duties, Payan has been designated a gang intervention 
specialist by the city of Ventura. The title has helped drive her to apply for 
and receive a host of grants, including $14,000 from the county to combat drug 
and alcohol abuse among Avenue youth. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants, which Westpark shares with other social service agencies, have 
paid for colorful murals on neighborhood walls and will fund a study to 
determine if the Avenue community has more than its share of liquor stores. 
</P>
<P>
 But the daily activities at Westpark aren't limited to any one grant or 
program. Payan says she wears "17 different hats." And life at Westpark 
includes formal day camp sessions, summer job activities and a wide range of 
other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of all this bustle and activity, the once shy and withdrawn Lovio 
has found her own self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roberta helped me develop my personal skills," she said. "She gave me 
self-confidence. I couldn't deal with stuff, but now I deal with the public 
almost every day." 
</P>
<P>
 If Payan did not promote the summer jobs program as vigorously as she does, 
Ulises Lopez, 15, would probably be spending this summer aimlessly hanging out 
on the streets of the Avenue neighborhood. Instead, he is supervising 
schoolchildren in a recreation program at the area's public housing complex, 
Westview Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Ulises doesn't trust many adults with confidences of any sort. But Payan, he 
said, is different. 
</P>
<P>
 "She grew up in the same place I did, so she knows what I'm growing up with," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Payan spent her youth hopscotching back and forth between the Avenue 
and the east side of Ventura, returning to the tough neighborhood of her early 
childhood when she entered high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a little bit on the strong-willed side," said her father, Antonio 
Payan, 68, laughing. "She did her own thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Often that included scuffles with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I just wanted attention, and you earned attention by being fearless," 
Payan said. "By today's standards, I wasn't a gangbanger. But then I was." 
</P>
<P>
 Chuckling, Payan combed through her file cabinets at the office and produced a 
glossy scrapbook chronicling her adolescence. An inside page displays a 
yellowing news clipping from the 1970s of a teen-age fight that erupted at the 
county fair. Next to the police account of the incident is a black-and-white 
picture of Payan being arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 She assaulted the police, she said, but only after an officer started 
scuffling with one of her friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, it's like, the fact that you are not one of us makes you a potential 
victim," she said. "Then, you fought for a reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Payan said she also received misdemeanor convictions for petty theft and 
violation of probation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1970s, however, she decided she wanted to change her life. Since 
then, her only trouble with the law has been a drunk-driving arrest in October, 
1993. Still on probation today, Payan had to attend a drunk-driving program, 
spend a night in jail and pay fines of more than $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Distressed by the arrest, Payan said the incident shows that, like the kids 
she works with around the Avenue, "I'm not perfect, either." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Payan's supporters, however, see her as being about as close to 
perfect as they could hope for in a community leader. They speak of her as a 
model for the neighborhood children, a success story who has been honored as 
one of the county's top Latino leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Payan's days begin as early as 5 a.m. and can end late into the evening. 
Single and childless, she pours her emotional and intellectual energies into 
the troubled youths of the Avenue. For many of them, she is part mentor, part 
buddy, part mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roberta's the kind of person who cares so much and wants to make a difference 
so much," said Jenise Wagar, a specialist in resource development for the city 
of Ventura who offered Payan her position. "Her job is her life." 
</P>
<P>
 Three years into the job, however, the fear that lurks at the edge of Payan's 
mind is that no matter how much she does, nothing is really going to get 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like you've got your finger in a dike," she said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Police Capt. Jim Cubbitt runs the storefront police station in the 
neighborhood, and he approaches the local youth-at-risk problem differently 
from Payan. He doesn't work as closely with kids fresh out of juvenile hall and 
looks with a skeptical eye on "former gang members" promising to reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Tight-lipped and stern-faced, Cubbitt said he guesses that Payan "fills a 
need" in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's necessary to deal with gang members and wanna-bes in this community," he 
said. "If somehow, through her counseling, she's prevented one stabbing, one 
burglary, then she's done something." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have worked for and with Payan would insist that she has 
accomplished much more. 
</P>
<P>
 "She'll give you a chance when nobody else will," Lovio said. "I was 
considered high-risk. I could've been in jail, on drugs. But, no, I stuck with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because she was, like, 'No, don't ever give up.' "

STUDENT DIED 'TRYING TO DO RIGHT THING'; CRIME: ROBERT SAPINOSO WAS KILLED 
WHILE RECORDING THE LICENSE NUMBER OF A SUSPICIOUS VAN. HIS FRIEND RECALLS 
HORROR OF THE ATTACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Robert Sapinoso's buddy said the two of them were merely "trying to do the 
right thing" when they followed a van whose occupants they believed were 
responsible for vandalism in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just trying to get a plate number," the friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 What they got instead Wednesday was a hail of bullets into their car, which 
left Sapinoso, 19, slumped behind the wheel, fatally shot. 
</P>
<P>
 As police continued searching for two people who drove off in a van, the 
20-year-old friend, who asked that his name not be used, Sunday recalled the 
harrowing experience that claimed his friend, a computer whiz who was studying 
engineering at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 They were tinkering on their cars at the friend's house about 6:45 p.m. 
Wednesday when they spotted a passing silver Toyota van that matched the 
description of one used by vandals there the previous weekend. They hopped into 
Sapinoso's Honda CRX to follow it, the friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 With Sapinoso at the wheel, they managed to get all but one digit of the 
license plate on the van, which pulled over two blocks away, his friend said. 
But on their way home, as the pair stopped at a traffic light, a passenger 
emerged from the van and strode toward them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The light was red. I told Robert, 'Run it, Robert!' By that time, the guy was 
coming up to the car," the friend said. "I thought he was going to kick the 
car. Then he pulled a gun from behind his back and started shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 The friend, a student at Cypress College, huddled near the floor of the tiny 
car amid a thunder of gunfire and splintering glass. Sapinoso doubled over too, 
but was blocked by the steering wheel from diving low. When the shooting ended 
moments later, the friend was unhurt. He said he called to his buddy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go, 'Robert, are you OK?' I looked at his face and his chest and he looked 
OK. Then he said, 'Ed,' and his eyes rolled back in his head," the friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 When he spotted the wounds in Sapinoso's back, the friend jumped from the car 
and screamed for help, but "there was no one out there or anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapinoso's friend decided that it would be quickest to take him to a hospital 
a mile away. He wrestled Sapinoso from the driver's seat and, with the shot-up 
driver's door flapping, sped to Vencor Hospital Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 When they arrived, the friend's cries for help drew a nurse who began 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation. "I was just praying, 'Hold on, Robert. Hold on,' 
" his friend said. "I thought, 'Oh God, this isn't happening.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But at 7:16 p.m., Sapinoso was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Police described the killer as Asian and aged 17 to 21. The gunman was 
bucktoothed and acne-scarred, Sapinoso's friend said. "If I saw him again, I'd 
know it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the weekend, Sapinoso's friends and relatives gathered around a 
simple gray casket and remembered him as a bashful and generous young man. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good Samaritan guy. He just wants to help anybody who needs help," 
said his father, Dan Sapinoso, flipping though a photo album for the pictures 
of Robert and the friends who were forever tinkering on the beloved white 
Honda. "That's the reason he got killed."

BILL LIMITING LAWYERS' TV ADS NEARS PASSAGE; LAW: BACKERS SAY THE HEAVILY 
AMENDED MEASURE TARGETS MISLEADING COMMERCIALS OF PERSONAL INJURY ATTORNEYS. 
OPPONENTS SAY IT THREATENS FREE SPEECH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sandwiched between the soaps and talk shows, commercials for attorneys 
saturate California television with an implicit message: Simply call the 
toll-free number on the screen and you are on your way to easy cash. 
</P>
<P>
 In one, a motorcyclist claims his lawyer got him "$175,000 even though the 
police report said I was totally at fault." In another, an accident victim 
happily reports that his lawyer came "to my hospital bed and less than a year 
later he got me $550,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Legislature appears ready to put the brakes on what critics call 
false or misleading TV commercials that are pitched to unsophisticated 
consumers without regard to the circumstances of particular cases. 
</P>
<P>
 If the bill becomes law, "blood on the street" commercials will vanish, 
predicts David Allen, a personal injury attorney who advertises on television 
in Northern California and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are not going to see a guy in a Hawaiian shirt drinking a mai tai and 
saying so and so got me $500,000," said Allen, who supports the measure. "He'll 
also have to tell you that he can never walk again or that his medical bills 
were over $1 million." 
</P>
<P>
 Until a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 1976, advertising by lawyers was 
essentially prohibited. Since then, ads have evolved from mundane but 
straightforward pleas for business in newspapers and telephone directories to 
full-blown, professionally produced television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed restrictions are contained in a heavily lobbied bill sponsored by 
the influential California Trial Lawyers Assn. It grew out of complaints of 
members in the fertile television marketing areas of Los Angeles and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas K. deVries, president of the association, asserts that the public's 
perception of justice has eroded to an "image of accident victims calling 
attorneys through toll-free numbers before calling their doctors and loved 
ones." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of this family fight among personal injury attorneys are 
lawyers who defend their advertising as an important service to low-income 
Californians who have legitimate claims but may not know how to obtain legal 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 These lawyers say the restrictive legislation threatens their constitutional 
right to free speech and that, although it is being advanced as a safeguard for 
consumers, it is really a grab by competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry H. Parker, a lawyer who frequently advertises on Southern California 
television, says the trial lawyers association wants to "eliminate competition 
under the guise of attempting to protect the consumer. These country club 
lawyers don't like guys like me taking cases from them." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker accused the association of targeting television advertisers for 
discriminatory treatment while ignoring virtually identical lawyer messages in 
the telephone directory Yellow Pages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people may say some of my ads are distasteful. Some will say they are 
great," Parker said. "The problem is, you cannot ban 1st Amendment rights (on 
the basis of taste). . . . If the consumer doesn't like the ad, they can turn 
the channel." 
</P>
<P>
 The measure (AB 3659) by Assemblyman Paul Horcher (R-Diamond Bar) has passed 
the Assembly. It is undergoing negotiation in the Senate and is expected to be 
approved before the Legislature adjourns Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, the bill was more restrictive. It would have essentially banned 
lawyer commercials from television, including those of divorce, bankruptcy and 
other attorneys. One version would have restricted commercials to a 
line-by-line scrolling on the screen of the lawyer's name, address, telephone 
number, date of birth and other objective but dull information. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bill was substantially amended by the Senate Judiciary Committee in 
the face of heavy opposition from attorneys who advertise, including Parker and 
the nationwide law firm of Jacoby & Meyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), himself an attorney with 
long political ties to the trial lawyers association, said he sponsored a pair 
of "gruesome" negotiating sessions between the two sides in an effort to reach 
a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I agree with the general view that the high mark for lawyers was when they 
wrote the United States Constitution and it has been mostly downhill ever 
since," he said. "So, I think efforts by lawyers to try to clean up their 
profession are laudatory." 
</P>
<P>
 The amended bill says a commercial "taken as a whole" must not be false, 
misleading or deceptive and that the lawyer must factually substantiate the 
veracity of the message. 
</P>
<P>
 The portrayal of certain issues, including references to money or the outcome 
of a case, would be presumed to be false or misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspected violators could be reported to the State Bar by anyone. Depending on 
its findings, the State Bar could recommend shelving the commercial, although 
it would not have the authority to pull the ad. 
</P>
<P>
 If lawyers refused to take ads off the air, they could be sued in court by the 
person who made the initial complaint. Violators would be subject to a civil 
penalty of up to $5,000 per broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker argues that such suits actually would be filed by competitors -- not 
consumers -- and that the advertisers could be endlessly tied up in court 
defending themselves. Proponents maintain the bill has safeguards against 
harassment suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Current law requires truthfulness in all advertising. But proponents of AB 
3659 argue that more is needed to cover lawyers who advertise on TV. Changes 
made in the Senate appear to have mollified most of the bill's detractors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the emphasis of the bill changed from essentially prohibiting lawyer 
advertising to prohibiting false and misleading advertising, that was fine with 
us," said Steve Meyers of Jacoby & Meyers, which switched from opposing the 
bill to supporting it. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker, himself a former official of the trial lawyers association, agreed 
that compromises in the bill have eliminated some of his objections, but says 
it still contains some "ugly stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 The association's deVries dismissed Parker's contention that the measure 
discriminates against television advertisers as opposed to those who advertise 
for clients in the Yellow Pages. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted, for example, that most law firms who fought the early versions of 
the bill now support the compromise. "There is only a small segment of 
advertising lawyers, specifically Parker, who at this point continue to 
object," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a truth-in-advertising law specific to attorney advertising," deVries 
said. "It aims only at attempting to assure that the public will not be 
bombarded by false, misleading or deceptive advertising."

NEWS ANALYSIS; BROWN HAS LEAD, BUT ALSO HAS PROBLEMS; POLITICS: DESPITE HER 
ADVANTAGE, THE CHALLENGER FACES A TOUGHER TASK THAN GOV. PETE WILSON. ATTACKING 
THE INCUMBENT WON'T BE ENOUGH. MORE VOTERS MUST THINK FAVORABLY OF HER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As a steamy summer slouches toward Labor Day, Democrat Kathleen Brown faces a 
nettlesome truism of politics in her quest to become the 37th governor of 
California: "You can't beat something with nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 That rule says a challenger has to do more than just attack the record of an 
incumbent to defeat him or her, even an incumbent who has been as unpopular as 
Brown's foe in the Nov. 8 general election, Republican Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Although recent polls have given her a small lead over Wilson, political 
experts believe the challenge remains for Brown, the 48-year-old state 
treasurer, to convince voters that she is a more acceptable alternative than 
another four years of Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown insists the groundwork has been laid and the process is under way. And 
she has 2 1/2 months left to work with. Many prospective voters will only begin 
paying attention in September or later. 
</P>
<P>
 But the burden unmistakably rests on Brown at the moment. Wilson aides believe 
all their candidate has to do is to continue doing what he has been doing -- be 
the dogged governor working in the trenches, and avoid any major errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran California pollster and analyst Mervin Field put it this way: "If the 
public was voting on Wilson today, it would be 2-to-1 'no.' He'd be out. But we 
don't elect or unelect candidates that way. It comes down to an alternative. 
And so far, they're voting 'no' on Wilson, but not yet voting 'yes' on Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem of defining herself to voters is a complex one for Brown. She has 
broad name identification as the daughter of one former governor, Edmund G. 
(Pat) Brown, 1959-67, and the sister of another, Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., 
1975-83. Her father is remembered fondly by older voters, but brother Jerry is 
still often derided by critics as the liberal "Gov. Moonbeam." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, most Californians don't know much about her, and her own public 
service -- five years on the Los Angeles school board and a term as state 
treasurer -- has not made her a commanding presence in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years after she began campaigning for governor, and national reporters 
began writing about the continuation of a Brown political dynasty, many 
Californians still tend to think of her as Pat Brown's daughter or Jerry's 
sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide candidates generally introduce themselves and define themselves to 
voters during the primary election campaign. Ideally, it should be done before 
the opponent does the defining with attack ads. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, the candidate says through words or pictures, or both: "This is who 
I am. This is what I've done. This is what I stand for. And this is my vision 
of what I want for California." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson did this in 1990 by projecting himself as a compassionate moderate, by 
outlining a series of preventive programs that would pay big dividends from an 
initial investment. One example was universal prenatal care for pregnant women. 
Another proposed giving all children health screening and services from their 
first days in public school for early detection of problems that might impair 
their education later on. 
</P>
<P>
 His Democratic opponent in 1990, Dianne Feinstein, was familiar in Northern 
California as the former mayor of San Francisco, but less known in the south. 
She overcame that largely by running the now-legendary "grabber" ad on 
television early in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forged from tragedy," the narrator intoned as newsreel footage showed a Board 
of Supervisors President Feinstein solemnly announcing the assassination of San 
Francisco Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk. 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial then talked about how Feinstein took charge of a troubled city 
as the new mayor, but also how she related to ordinary people in need. "Tough, 
but caring," was the message. Feinstein's poll standing rocketed. She won a 
tough Democratic primary election by a surprisingly large margin. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown did not face that kind of challenge and has not done the sort of 
detailed biographical commercial -- usually a full-minute ad -- that 
challengers typically run. While breezing to a Democratic primary victory, she 
ran one 30-second biographical ad, but it was overshadowed by a flurry of 
negative commercials the week before the June 8 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the primary, Brown's television campaign has consisted largely of a 
relentless attack on the Wilson record. It was only last week that Brown began 
to air a positive message, and began to sketch in her background, in two ads 
that promise to restore to Californians "the fair share that middle-class 
families deserve." 
</P>
<P>
 Pollster Field said that Brown's celebrity status and "incredible media focus" 
early in the campaign may have done her a disservice. 
</P>
<P>
 "She may have suffered from being so far ahead and thinking it was easy. It's 
not so easy," Field said. 
</P>
<P>
 The full Brown-definition phase is still to come, Clint Reilly, Brown's 
campaign manager, has said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pending that, the political wisdom in California this month has been that 
Brown needed a "spark" of some sort to draw attention to her campaign and 
generate support. Brown contends that the process is well under way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe they're looking for the spark in all the wrong places," Brown said in 
an interview last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said her effort will build incrementally between now and Election Day 
rather than burst forth like an explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a prairie fire," Brown said last week with a grin and a lusty 
laugh, alluding to a newspaper report that likened some of her themes to those 
used by Republican Ronald Reagan in 1966 to drive her father from the 
governorship. Reagan had likened his campaign to a prairie fire of change 
sweeping across California. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, one well-connected Sacramento Democrat who asked not to be identified 
said, "I think she's in deep trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason, this expert explained, is that Brown allowed herself to be lured 
into a one-on-one battle this summer with Wilson on crime issues -- a struggle 
that many think Brown cannot come close to winning. 
</P>
<P>
 "He baits her and she takes the bait," the official said. "She's got to stop 
doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 Field disagrees. Crime is one area in which the public still believes 
government can be effective, he said, adding that "she can't yield" on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said she believes she has effectively neutralized any Wilson advantage 
on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best shot he can take," she said. "If this is the best he's got 
and he can't whip me in August. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Recent polls rate the governor's race as basically neck and neck. At one point 
last year, Brown enjoyed an illusory 23-point lead over Wilson. The shift in 
fortune has made Brown into a seeming underdog. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, reporters were challenging Wilson's campaign manager, George 
Gorton, to tell them just how he planned to save Wilson's political skin in 
November, 1994. Now they call to ask what Brown could do to win, or what sort 
of Wilson miscue could cause him to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a change in conversation a year makes," Gorton said with a happy sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's main task now is to keep plugging away as governor, to do what he has 
been doing without making a major mistake, Field and others said. Wilson has a 
reputation as a gritty, dogged campaigner with a veteran staff not prone to 
making mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sacramento Democrat who believes Brown is in trouble said Wilson 
increasingly is being seen "as a sympathetic figure who has been trying hard" 
in spite of recession, riots, fires, floods and earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 To counter that sort of thinking, said William Schneider of the American 
Enterprise Institute in Washington, Brown must convince voters that under 
Wilson, California has fallen into general decline -- in the economy, education 
and other areas of life -- but that there can be good times again with the 
proper leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has to be upbeat," Schneider said. "Challengers don't get very far 
talking about how awful things are. The way she has to do it is talking about 
pride in the state and determination to turn the direction around." 
</P>
<P>
 That, in fact, is what Brown has begun to do. In speeches and in her most 
recent television ads, Brown lamented middle-class families not "getting their 
fair share" under Republican leadership. She promised to cut the bureaucracy, 
reduce welfare benefits and better safeguard the taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, she added, "I'll use the savings for better schools and colleges, job 
creation and police -- the fair share middle-class families deserve." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson aide Gorton contends that this broad appeal is a strategic mistake. 
Brown needs to solidify her natural liberal Democratic base first before 
reaching out to voters in the center and toward the right, he said. But then, 
the Wilson strategy is to tar Brown as a liberal and to turn the contest into 
the sort of ideological struggle a Democrat cannot win. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats doubt that liberals will vote for Wilson. But there is concern those 
voters might stay home on Nov. 8 unless motivated. Bill Press, Democratic state 
chairman, said the party has budgeted $30 million for an unprecedented drive to 
get potential Democrats to register to vote and to field a vote-by-mail 
campaign and a massive get-out-the-vote drive on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats had virtually no such effort in 1990, when Feinstein lost to Wilson 
by 3.5% of the vote. One target, Press said, will be an estimated 1.4 million 
Democratic women who voted in 1992, but not in 1990 or in the 1994 party 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, Brown also recalled positive aspects of the governorships of 
her father and her brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Her family ties have been something of a wash for Kathleen Brown. Republicans 
will concede her the residual good feelings about her aged, ailing father, but 
not without trying to stain her with the flaky reputation of Jerry Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in Ventura last week, Brown proudly recalled her father as a builder 
for California's future and for the middle class -- schools, the colleges and 
universities and the freeways. Indeed, she acknowledged, her brother put a stop 
to that and proclaimed the era of limits. But the Jerry Brown Administration 
also should be remembered as one that brought diverse groups of Californians 
into the political process for the first time and empowered them to solve 
problems, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And my job," she added, "is the job of bringing and weaving together those 
traditions in the spirit of the limits of our resources, whether they are 
natural resources or fiscal resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to manage them differently . . . to be able to ensure that our kids 
get a good education, that our people have the opportunity for good jobs, and 
that once again we can call our communities safe and reclaim them for ourselves 
and our children. And that's what this campaign is all about."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: 20 YEARS AFTER PROP. 9, REFORM STILL ELUSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This year marks the 20th anniversary of the voters' enthusiastic approval of a 
ballot measure they were told would make the state safe from political 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right. Proposition 9, we were assured, would "put an end to corruption 
in politics and (make) politicians directly responsible to the people -- not to 
purchased demands of special interests." 
</P>
<P>
 So much for noble goals. The 14 convictions generated by an FBI sting 
operation attest to the fact that political corruption festered at the Capitol 
long after Jerry Brown, Ralph Nader and other reformers persuaded 70% of the 
electorate to approve Proposition 9. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, some of Proposition 9 has been a success, mainly the requirement 
of campaign finance disclosures. One feature has been a joke: the $10 monthly 
limit on what lobbyists can spend entertaining a legislator -- "enough for two 
hamburgers and a Coke," Brown said back then. 
</P>
<P>
 But most significantly, two essential elements -- spending limits for 
statewide campaigns and a ban on lobbyist contributions -- were thrown out by 
the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem in campaign finance," notes University of Virginia professor 
Larry Sabato, "is that we want completely clean elections with no tainted money 
-- and we want full and unfettered rights of free speech and association. You 
cannot have both. If you're not going to tinker with the 1st Amendment, you 
have to accept the fact that you can't dam the flow of political money." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps not dam, but control. In recent years, legislators and reformers have 
wrestled with proposals aimed at cleaning up what former Atty. Gen. John Van de 
Kamp in 1990 called "the Sacramento swamp." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Voters have indicated they're not fussy about how politics is cleaned up -- 
just do it. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, they approved a sweeping reform measure, Proposition 68, authorizing 
partial public financing of legislative campaigns. On the same ballot, they 
approved Proposition 73, which specifically banned public financing. Because 73 
got slightly more votes, it prevailed. But a federal court, basically on a 
technicality, stripped Proposition 73 of its key feature limiting campaign 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Partial taxpayer financing of local campaigns, together with limits on 
contributions and spending, have been authorized by voters in Los Angeles and 
Long Beach. Voters also have imposed contribution limits in six other major 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 But statewide, voters have been whipsawed and confused. And 20 years after 
Proposition 9, there still are no limits on contributions or spending in state 
or legislative races (except in special elections) and no public financing. 
</P>
<P>
 That brings us to today in the Capitol, with 60% of the legislators' campaign 
bills being footed by special interest PACs. Another 15% comes from political 
parties and legislative leaders, who also rely on PACs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It is time to put the B.S. aside," veteran Assemblyman John Vasconcellos 
(D-Santa Clara) told his colleagues last week during a floor debate. "Money 
poisons politics and corrupts this place. Public financing is the key to 
reform." 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic politicians generally buy that, but most Republicans don't, 
including Gov. Pete Wilson. The governor says there are better ways to spend 
tax money than on politicians' campaigns. That has a nice ring, but ignores the 
reality of special interests outbidding the public for political influence with 
their big contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Political self-interest also weighs heavily. Republicans tend to favor 
limiting the size of contributions because they have many wealthy friends who 
can write checks. Democrats don't, so they like the idea of public subsidies. 
Incumbents of both parties like spending limits because they crimp little-known 
challengers, but the Supreme Court has ruled they're only allowable with public 
financing. The reform issue is heating up again as legislators scramble to 
adjourn their 1994 session. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate leader Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) is sponsoring a bill that would affect 
only fall legislative races. It runs the gamut: partial public financing with 
limits on contributions and spending. There would be extra public funds for 
candidates whose rich opponents refuse to abide by the limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill passed both houses and is in a conference committee. It is backed by 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and also Senate GOP leader Ken 
Maddy (R-Fresno). If signed by Wilson, it would go on the 1996 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a chance," predicts a Wilson adviser. Perhaps next year when he's free of 
reelection jitters. 
</P>
<P>
 Or when Kathleen Brown -- Jerry's sister -- is governor. She's a strong 
supporter of public financing.

CHINESE MANEUVER TO SUCCEED AILING LEADER; ASIA: AS DENG XIAOPING TURNS 90, 
NATION FACES UNCERTAIN FUTURE. JIANG ZEMIN SEEN AS SUCCESSOR, BUT FIELD IS 
CROWDED. 
</P>

<P>
 In the 45 years since the creation of the People's Republic of China, only two 
men have held undisputed power over this vast land of 1.2 billion people. 
</P>
<P>
 Communist China's founder, Mao Tse-tung, died in 1976. His ultimate successor 
at the helm, Deng Xiaoping, frail and no longer capable of speaking in public, 
turns 90 years old today. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite several years of rumors that he is dead or dying, Deng stubbornly 
clings to life. Several unofficial reports have him celebrating his 90th 
birthday in the company of other senior leaders at the seaside resort of 
Beidaihe, 100 miles east of Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, Deng's birthday has been noted by the release of his collected 
works in several languages and the sale of bronze plaques of the 5-foot, 2-inch 
leader in government bookstores. A new eight-volume work, "Deng Xiaoping: A 
Great Man and His Century," was released earlier this month by the People's 
Liberation Army Cultural Publishing House. 
</P>
<P>
 Politically, however, China has already entered into what Columbia University 
scholar Andrew Nathan has called "pre post-Deng maneuvering." The 
behind-the-scenes battle for succession was accelerated by Deng's last public 
appearance in February, when the Chinese leader seemed mentally lost and 
confused as he clung to the arm of one of his daughters at a Shanghai hotel 
reception. 
</P>
<P>
 Deng's birthday has produced little public fanfare in the capital, but his 
advanced age has produced the inevitable comparison with Mao. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deng is not as great as Mao," said a 20-year-old university student who 
identified himself only as Liu. "Mao was the Great Helmsman. Deng is like a 
paternalistic powerful boss of a multinational corporation. He cannot give 
people belief, but he knows how to do things and deal with people. These are 
the qualities of the entrepreneur." 
</P>
<P>
 Others face the post-Deng era with apprehension. 
</P>
<P>
 "The longer he lives, the more we will be in balance," said Xioa Jin, 31. "No 
society is totally stable. He is the one who holds the scale. . . . After his 
death, the possibility of instability is 50%. Hard to say who will replace him. 
China is a very strange country because it is impossible to predict what 
happens tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Most China watchers name President and Communist Party General Secretary Jiang 
Zemin as Deng's logical successor. Jiang, 68, who also holds the important 
position of chairman of the Central Military Commission, has spent the past 
several years attempting to consolidate his position by developing close 
relationships in the all-important Chinese military Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 In his effort to woo the military, Jiang has traveled frequently to key army 
posts and recently promoted 19 new generals, presumably loyal to him. In May, 
he made a strong statement in support of the army's controversial role in 
crushing the 1989 democracy movement that is certain to please hard-line 
factions of the military. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that Jiang Zemin is much better positioned than he was a few years 
ago," said Michael D. Swaine, a RAND Corp. expert on the Chinese military. 
"Also, many of the senior officers simply don't see a good alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 Jiang also is said to be Deng's personal choice. But in Chinese history that 
is not always a blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 In this regard, Jiang suffers from what some describe as the "Hua Guofeng 
syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
 Hua was Chairman Mao's handpicked successor. "With you in charge, I'm at 
ease," Mao reportedly said to Hua. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hapless Hua lasted less than two years after his patron's death before 
fading into obscurity as Deng took power, by some recent accounts through a 
military-backed coup d'etat . 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, in 1986 Deng told foreign visitors that his chosen successors were 
reform-minded Communist Party leaders Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang. "If the sky 
falls, they will hold it up," Deng was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hu, then the party general secretary, was forced out in 1987; Zhao, hero 
of the liberal economic reformers and Hu's successor as general secretary, was 
stripped of his duties after the 1989 protests. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting in the wings for Jiang to fail are a host of pretenders, including 
hard-line Chinese Premier Li Peng, 66. Among oft-mentioned candidates are 
economic reformer Zhu Rongji, 66, and powerful military figure Yang Shangkun, 
86, one of the last living veterans of the "Long March" that led to Communist 
control of the entire mainland in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 A favorite dark horse is Qiao Shi, 70, chairman of the National People's 
Congress. Qiao's background as head of the secret police and overseas 
intelligence makes him a possible compromise candidate, favorable to the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Zhao, 75, the party reformer who was placed under virtual house arrest 
following the 1989 crackdown on Tian An Men Square, is not out of the picture. 
Zhao recently toured Sichuan, Deng's home province, and has been seen 
increasingly in public. 
</P>
<P>
 Commented one Western diplomat in Beijing recently: "For a man who was 
supposed to be a political corpse, Zhao Ziyang is still very much alive." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Prof. Richard Baum, author of a political biography of Deng, predicts 
that "elder statesmen" such as Yang Shangkun, Qiao Shi or Wan Li, 77, will play 
a key role in determining the post-Deng ruling order. Formerly head of the 
National People's Congress, Wan now holds only ceremonial positions. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . 'Elder statesmen' like Yang, Qiao and Wan are likely to play key roles 
in the new lineup," Baum said. "As to who their likely successors would be . . 
. all I can say is that Jiang Zemin and Li Peng are not likely to remain in 
office for more than 12 months after Deng dies."

WASHINGTON OUTLOOK: CLINTON MUST STILL SEARCH FOR WAYS TO BREAK GRIDLOCK; CRIME 
BILL POINTS UP PROBLEMS OF TRYING TO BUILD BIPARTISAN COALITION IN THE CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Along with the spectacle of senior legislators pulling a string of 
all-nighters like so many procrastinating college students, the rise, fall and 
apparent resurrection of the crime bill over the last 11 days also points to a 
fork in the road for Bill Clinton as he tries to revive his beleaguered 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first four days after the House rejected the crime bill on a 
procedural vote Aug. 11, President Clinton fired rhetorical missiles at 
Congress, especially Republicans, whom he painted as tools of the gun lobby. 
Then last Tuesday, he shifted gears, reached out to moderate Republicans and 
tenaciously hammered out the deal that carried the bill through the House on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, in a little over a week, Clinton displayed both of his options for 
dealing with a Congress increasingly resistant to his major initiatives. He can 
style himself as a modern Harry S. Truman -- crisscrossing the country to lash 
the do-nothing Congress. Or, he can sit down with moderate Republicans and make 
a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 That's essentially the choice Clinton faces on health care reform. As the 
prospects dwindle for the sweeping changes he would prefer, his options come 
down to accepting the substantially slimmed-down reforms that bipartisan 
coalitions of moderates are offering in both houses or to rejecting anything 
that fails to meet his goal of universal coverage and then taking his case to 
the country. He may face the same choice on virtually all other issues after 
November, if Republicans make the gains in the midterm elections that now 
appear likely. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton chooses to work with Republicans, he may first need to consider 
what went wrong on the crime bill, which was supposed to demonstrate his 
ability to build a bipartisan coalition in the center. Instead, it became the 
textbook example of how excessive partisanship and ideological rigidity in 
Congress -- and miscalculations in the White House -- have prevented Clinton 
from surmounting Washington's culture of perpetual polarization. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton began the crime debate with a good idea: to break the longstanding 
gridlock between left and right by advancing ideas favored by both. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as with previous crime bills, not enough people on the left or the right 
were willing to meet in the middle -- especially once the bill arrived in the 
House after the Senate passed it overwhelmingly. House liberals stalled the 
bill for months and sapped its momentum by pushing a provision easing the way 
for prisoners on Death Row to challenge their sentences as racially biased -- 
an amendment that amounted to a poison pill. Conservatives advanced ideas that 
they understood to be anathema to liberals. 
</P>
<P>
 "This partisan leadership on both sides took an issue where there was a 
bipartisan consensus and turned it into a polarizing fight," said Al From, 
president of the Democratic Leadership Council. 
</P>
<P>
 As the crime bill laboriously proceeded through the House, Clinton's kernel of 
insight about funding both prevention and punishment got bloated almost beyond 
recognition. By the end, the Administration and Democratic congressional 
leaders were trying to pass the bill the old-fashioned way: by stuffing in 
projects and programs designed to buy off every dissenting faction. 
</P>
<P>
 So what began as an attempt to transcend tired ideological arguments about 
crime became business as usual in a more profound sense: a bidding war that 
inflated the bill from $22 billion over five years in the Senate, to $27 
billion in the House, to $30 billion (over six years) in the final measure. In 
the process, Clinton sacrificed the rudder of fiscal restraint necessary to 
govern from the center. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when all other domestic spending was ground under the boots of 
spending caps, the crime bill magically had wings. Inevitably, everyone jostled 
to get on board. In relative terms, Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), who slipped in 
$10 million for a university in his district, was a chiseler. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest offenses came from House liberals seeking money for crime 
"prevention." That's not to accept the crude conservative argument that all 
attempts to reduce crime through social programs constitutes make-work for 
social workers. In fact, the bill funds several narrowly targeted programs that 
have wide support from community leaders in troubled neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was that House liberals, with White House acquiescence, also 
lathered into the bill a stack of large, vaguely defined grant programs for 
cities. Thus there would be "ounce-of-prevention" grants at $100 million; youth 
employment skill grants at $550 million; "model intensive" grants to cities to 
experiment with coordinated crime-prevention programs at $895 million; and $1.8 
billion in Local Partnership Act grants to low-income cities -- a thinly 
disguised revival of revenue sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than say no to the left on prevention, no to the right on prisons, or 
scale back his own promise of 100,000 police officers, the President agreed to 
extend the bill to a sixth year and raise the overall price tag to $33.2 
billion. No choices would have to be made, no priorities established. No one 
would leave the table feeling cheated on dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 Except that under the weight of all the deals and promises, the table 
collapsed. Excessive spending may not have been the principal reason for votes 
against the bill from Republicans unwilling to give Clinton a victory, or 
Democrats afraid to buck the National Rifle Assn. But excessive spending was 
the argument that struck a chord with the public -- and diluted the pressure on 
legislators that Clinton once hoped would save the original bill. Though the 
new synthesis of punishment and prevention that Clinton promised remained at 
the bill's core, it had become obscured by the thicket of tangential programs 
he could have pruned back long before Republicans had him at the point of a 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
 At his press conference last Friday, Clinton suggested that the bipartisan 
negotiations on crime could offer a model for alliances across party lines on 
other issues, especially health care. (He could help along the process by 
remembering his campaign promise to appoint Republicans to the Cabinet as a way 
of encouraging inclusion.) In Democratic ranks on Sunday, there was widespread 
agreement that the moderate Republicans, led by Rep. Michael N. Castle 
(R-Del.), bargained reasonably and in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the final bill arguably improved on the conference report by reducing 
some of the bill's redundant social programs and imposing stiffer reporting 
requirements on released sexual offenders. Reaching out to centrist Republicans 
allowed Clinton to pass the bill with the assault weapon ban -- something he 
could not have done if he had relied solely on Democrats, as the House 
Democratic leadership urged. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime legislation still has to run another gantlet in the Senate, where 
conservative Republicans have threatened another assault. But the changes that 
attracted bipartisan backing in the House should give the bill a firmer 
foundation to withstand those gales in the upper chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton desperately needs a victory on the crime bill. But congressional 
leaders in both parties may also need progress more than they recognize. In a 
Time/CNN poll released Sunday, more than 9 of every 10 Americans polled 
expressed little faith in Washington's capacity to cope with the country's 
major problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more strikingly, the percentage who told pollsters that they would prefer 
a candidate for Congress this fall who belonged to neither party roughly 
equaled the number who preferred Democrats or Republicans. Those numbers can 
only rise -- and provide more tinder for an independent challenge against both 
parties in the 1996 presidential race -- if the encouraging bipartisan 
agreement on Sunday proves just a momentary calm in the capital storm.

'94 CRIME BILL IS FIRST IN 5 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congress has not passed a major crime bill since 1988, when it expanded the 
death penalty to major drug traffickers and placed restrictions on plastic 
guns. Since then, frustration and deadlock have ruled: 
</P>
<P>
 1989 -- President George Bush unveils a $1.2-billion crime bill in May, 
calling for increased law enforcement and prison construction and tougher 
sentencing.Democrats criticize the package for limiting Death Row appeals and 
not banning semiautomatic assault weapons. After the two sides fail to reach 
consensus, Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) requests a postponement until early 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 1990 -- Bush signs the Crime Control Act, a remnant of his original proposal, 
after House and Senate conferees strip away the major aspects of the bill: an 
expanded federal death penalty, limits on appeals and restrictions on 
semiautomatic assault weapons. The final bill increases penalties for child 
abuse and adds funding for local law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 1991 -- Senate Republicans kill an anti-crime bill with a filibuster after it 
clears the Democrat-controlled House. The final bill would have greatly 
expanded the federal death penalty and imposed a waiting period for handgun 
purchases. Bush and the Republicans complain that the bill does not go far 
enough in restricting Death Row appeals and loosening curbs on illegally seized 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 1992 -- Sen. George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) attempts to reintroduce the measure 
filibustered in 1991. But after Democrats and Republicans failed to resolve 
their differences, GOP senators filibuster again -- and Democratic efforts to 
close debate fail. The measure dies. D'JAMILA SALEM

DINGELL QUITS NRA BOARD, VOTES FOR CRIME BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) quit the board of the National Rifle Assn. on 
Sunday as he prepared to vote for the crime bill, which bans 19 types of 
assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Dingell said in a letter to NRA President Tom Washington: "I find the conflict 
between my responsibilities as a member of Congress and my duties as a board 
member of the National Rifle Assn. irreconcilable." 
</P>
<P>
 In a House speech, Dingell said he strongly opposed the crime bill's assault 
weapon ban as an infringement of gun owners' rights. But he said he was 
nevertheless supporting the $30-billion bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The NRA strongly opposed the bill, and supporters of the measure said it had 
mounted an eleventh-hour campaign to try to kill it.

DECISION IN MEXICO; TIJUANA VOTERS RECALL ASSASSINATED CANDIDATE; BAJA

 The Lomas Taurinas neighborhood sprawls across an urban canyon, a natural 
amphitheater that was the stage for the crime that changed Mexican history in 
March -- and cast a shadow over the presidential election Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Five months after an assassin emerged from a crowd in a dirt plaza here and 
gunned down ruling party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, Lomas 
Taurinas confronted history again. Solemn voters lined up at outdoor polling 
places in a dusty, impoverished landscape dominated by tributes to the fallen 
Colosio: signs, a larger-than-life statue, a shrine marking the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all my heart, I wanted him to win," said Emilia Arangure, an elderly 
woman dressed in black who stopped at the shrine to kneel in prayer. 
"Unfortunately, death came first. I came to vote for him in spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 Also paying her respects was Maria Teresa Asencio, a 20-year-old landscaper, 
who recalled how on March 23 she shook Colosio's hand at the fateful campaign 
rally, then later watched in shock when he was brought down by two gunshots. 
Like many residents of this neighborhood, a stronghold of the ruling 
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), Asencio said she voted for Colosio's 
replacement, Ernesto Zedillo, describing him as the candidate most capable of 
fighting crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel the most secure with him," Asencio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Politically charged violence has created fear and uncertainty in Baja 
California. In addition to the Colosio assassination, Baja has been hit by the 
ambush murder of the Tijuana police chief and shootouts and scandals involving 
drug lords and corrupt police. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the crisis does not typify life in the border state, and election 
day appeared to be shaping up as peaceful, if occasionally disorganized. 
</P>
<P>
 Baja's well-educated, civically active population has consistently registered 
the highest voter turnout levels in the nation: almost 80% in local elections 
in 1992. Compared to rural regions where PRI domination produces apathy, vote 
fraud and election-related strife, Baja's political culture has grown more 
democratic after five years of rule by the opposition National Action Party 
(PAN). 
</P>
<P>
 "We are advanced in the culture of political tolerance," said Tijuana Mayor 
Hector Osuna Jaime, a member of PAN. "We are accustomed to the alternation of 
power, to different political parties in the government." The question Sunday 
was whether the opposition would finally wrest the presidency away from the PRI 
-- and what role this small but crucial state would play in the struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 All three candidates are considered competitive here. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas is 
much stronger to the south, Cardenas won Baja in his 1988 presidential bid. 
Zedillo, who during campaign visits reminded audiences that he grew up in 
Mexicali, has led polls conducted locally. As for Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, 
he has drawn on the PAN's historical base of support along the length of the 
urban, independent-minded border area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there could be a surprise," said Jorge Perez, a Lomas Taurinas 
factory worker, who said he planned to vote for Fernandez. "Zedillo doesn't 
convince me. Diego has more character." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez was interviewed as he watched churchgoers crossing a tattered bridge to 
the polling station in front of a row of multicolored shops. They lined up 
silently, intent on the voting ritual, taking refuge from the sun beating down 
on the plaza where bulldozers had been hard at work on a new park in recent 
weeks. Some residents dismissed the project as an unsubtle effort by the 
government to win votes for the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in Tijuana, government officials and election observers reported no 
major incidents or problems at the majority of polling places. The most common 
complaint was the failure of some election officials to begin the voting on 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, an observer working for the state human rights commission said he 
had observed some breakdowns in the much-publicized security measures promised 
by the government. For example, a late start caused some officials to neglect 
to sign the ballot forms as required and others did not check the thumbs of 
voters for the indelible ink indicating they had already cast ballots, said the 
observer, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 The most urgent problems, however, arose at eight special Tijuana polling 
places designated for "voters in transit," a category encompassing Mexicans 
residing in the United States but eligible to vote in Mexico. The sheer number 
of voters overwhelmed the system in Tijuana, as it did throughout the nation; 
at the airport, the bus station and the main post office in the downtown 
tourist district, lines stretched for blocks, causing five-hour waits and angry 
grumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problems at the special polling places are very serious," said Javier 
Gonzalez Monroy, a city council member and state president of the PRD. "There 
is a general lack of organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez pointed out that support for Cardenas is particularly strong among 
Mexicans in the United States and that the PRD could suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 Emilio and Adriana Santos, a factory worker and nurse from South Gate, 
accompanied a cousin from Jalisco to Tijuana hoping to vote, then realized they 
did not possess current voting credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his 15 years living north of the border, Emilio Santos said he remains 
engrossed in Mexican politics and hopeful for a clean and fair election. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want a change," he said. "The people will not accept more lies and 
stealing. We want the truth."

MEXICANS IN U.S. DO THEIR CIVIC DUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Sunday's presidential election in Mexico was so important to Los Angeles 
seamstress Irma Montoya that she car-pooled to Tijuana to cast her ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I live in Los Angeles, what goes on in Mexico affects me because 
my family is still there," Montoya, 26, said Sunday afternoon after returning 
from the border city. 
</P>
<P>
 Montoya, a Mexican citizen and a legal Los Angeles resident since 1983, was 
enjoying soft drinks with her young American-born children under a tree in 
MacArthur Park as she often does on Sunday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
 She had left for Tijuana on Saturday in a van with 11 other residents of the 
Pico-Union area, leaving her children with their father, her ex-husband. The 
group spent the night in the border town and voted first thing Sunday in one of 
the eight polling places set up there for Mexican citizens living outside the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Montoya said she voted for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party 
candidate, Ernesto Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a vote for stability," said the native of Mexico City -- even though 
her heart was with conservative National Action Party (PAN) candidate Diego 
Fernandez de Cevallos. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the PRD (Democratic Revolutionary Party) or any other party but the PRI 
wins, there would be violence and I would be afraid for my family," said 
Montoya, who sends money to relatives in Mexico City but plans to stay in Los 
Angeles because, she says, life is easier here for women alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Montoya said she saw several police officers at the border, and before she was 
allowed to vote, election officials carefully checked the photo ID card she had 
obtained at the Mexican Consulate in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Other U.S. residents were not so lucky. After traveling south of the border to 
do their civic duty, many were turned away because their voting credentials had 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting near Montoya at the park, construction worker Antonio de Jesus said he 
had little interest in the presidential politics in his native country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no preference -- they're all same to me," said De Jesus, who comes 
from the state of Guerrero. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he didn't vote because it was too much trouble to get an ID card, then 
drive to the border to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Across town, at the PRD headquarters in Alhambra, everybody was talking about 
the election; the party set up this headquarters during the 1988 presidential 
campaign to inform expatriate voters. 
</P>
<P>
 A huge Mexican flag fluttered in the breeze outside, and the converted former 
garage was festooned with pictures of presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas and slogans that said "Change Is Security" and "Democracy Now!" 
</P>
<P>
 Next to one somber photo of Cardenas was a streamer that said: "Something More 
Than a Smile." Cardenas, son of the 1930s Mexican president Lazaro Cardenas, 
has said he will not smile until he is elected president. 
</P>
<P>
 Many here and in Mexico believe that widespread fraud cheated Cardenas out of 
the presidency in the 1988 election, in which PRI candidate Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari was declared the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 All day Sunday, Spanish-language television and radio stations blared election 
news from Mexico City. It would be a long night, but supporters here expressed 
confidence that their candidate would win. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Gonzalez, a 49-year-old tool-and-die maker living in East Los Angeles and 
an official of the PRD, said Cardenas is likely to win because this election 
was expected to be the fairest in his nation's history. And he dismissed polls 
predicting otherwise, saying they were all tainted. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gonzalez admitted he was angry that the Mexican government made it so 
difficult for Mexican citizens living abroad to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know Los Angeles is a bastion of PRD support. That's why they don't let 
us vote here," he said. Gonzalez did not go to Tijuana to vote; he opted to 
work in PRD headquarters here.

BOY WHO REFUSED LIVER TRANSPLANT DRUGS DIES; MEDICINE: FLORIDA 15-YEAR-OLD 
DRAWS LAST BREATH IN HIS MOTHER'S ARMS TWO MONTHS AFTER COURT LET HIM STOP 
TAKING ANTI-REJECTION MEDICATION. 
</P>

<P>
 He endured two liver transplants for the chance at life, but 15-year-old 
Benito Agrelo found the anti-rejection drugs made him so sick that the battle 
just wasn't worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 Benito died at his Coral Springs, Fla., home in his mother's arms early 
Saturday, two months after going to court for the right to stop taking the 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mami, hug," Benito said just before he died, opening his eyes and raising his 
arms to his mother, Armanda Agrelo, who had kept a bedside vigil. The two 
embraced, Benito smiled and took his last breath, his sister said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few day ago, my mom told him that he was going to see Jesus before she did, 
and that when he sees him to give him a big hug for her," said Benito's sister, 
Ava Senra Agrelo. "That was his hug." 
</P>
<P>
 Benito had fallen into a coma two days before his death and only awoke to say 
goodby to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 He won the right to stop taking his medication in June, after the Florida 
Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services forcibly hospitalized him for 
three days -- until a judge intervened. 
</P>
<P>
 Benito said he couldn't stand the medicines' side effects -- fierce headaches 
and irritability -- and wanted to die in peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Broward Circuit Judge Arthur Birken ruled the boy could go home and could not 
be forced to take the anti-rejection medications. 
</P>
<P>
 His ruling came after a long visit with Benito that included four hours of 
testimony from doctors who had treated the teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 Benito said at the time that he had thought about the decision for three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired of living in pain. I'd rather stay at home and live as close as I 
can to a natural life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Benito received his first new liver when he was 8 and his second in December, 
1992, but he decided last summer to cut back on anti-rejection medicine. Last 
October, he quit taking the medicine altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everything was meant to happen exactly the way it happened," Ava 
Senra Agrelo said. "I was raised to believe that everything happens for a 
reason. I know it through so many different things that have happened through 
the past few months, through things that Benny said and did."

CHAVIS MAY FORM GROUP TO RIVAL NAACP; CIVIL RIGHTS: OUSTED LEADER WELCOMES 
FARRAKHAN, 60 OTHER BLACK ACTIVISTS AT SUMMIT THAT THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION 
HAD SAID WAS POSTPONED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FULWOOD III, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ousted NAACP head Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. rebounded Sunday from his firing by 
embracing controversial Nation of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan at a black 
leadership summit. At the same time, there was speculation that Chavis is 
organizing a new, grass-roots organization to challenge the nation's oldest 
civil rights group. 
</P>
<P>
 As the NAACP board began its search for a new executive director, Chavis 
welcomed Farrakhan and about 60 other black activists to a summit that included 
representatives of community organizations, fraternities and sororities, and 
religious groups. 
</P>
<P>
 In doing so, Chavis contradicted NAACP Chairman William F. Gibson, who had 
informed reporters after Chavis' dismissal Saturday night that the summit had 
been postponed. The 2 1/2-day series of private strategy sessions and public 
town hall meetings was relocated from the NAACP headquarters to two black 
churches here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to move forward," Chavis said in his opening address at the 
National African American Leadership Summit. "We're not going to let what 
happened yesterday pull us back." 
</P>
<P>
 Describing Chavis' conduct during his 16-month tenure as "inimical to the best 
interests" of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, Gibson 
declined to say precisely why the board -- for the first time in its 85-year 
history -- fired its executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 The phrasing of the board's resolution, however, was broad enough to cover a 
range of complaints against Chavis, including his use of NAACP money to pay a 
former employee $332,400 to settle her threatened suit charging him with sex 
discrimination and wrongful discharge, as well as his attempts to redirect the 
group to appeal to younger, more confrontational members. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis' remarks immediately after being fired Saturday night and a day later 
at the summit suggested that he is laying the foundation for a new group aimed 
at "mobilizing the masses" of young and poor blacks who supported him as NAACP 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good," Chavis shouted to the summit participants, sounding like soul 
singer James Brown. "As I reflect back now . . . I recall my election (as NAACP 
executive director) took place on Good Friday in 1993. Now there's been a 
crucifixion, but today we celebrate the resurrection." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Orange, president of the Baltimore chapter of the NAACP and one of 
Chavis' strongest supporters within the organization, said he sensed that 
Chavis was testing his support for a rival group. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange said the NAACP board would respond to such a challenge by "deciding 
what role it wants to play with respect to the grass roots. Once things settle 
down, I think they would have to get involved with that process. They have 
wanted to do that all along, but they were concerned with how Dr. Chavis was 
doing it and how fast he was doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 In a news conference immediately following his dismissal, an emotional but 
defiant Chavis promised he wouldn't fade from the civil rights spotlight even 
if the NAACP no longer wanted his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 And he added: "This is unity time. We'll stay together come hell and high 
water." 
</P>
<P>
 The leadership summit that began Sunday is a follow-up to a similar meeting 
held last June and was one of the more controversial NAACP programs during 
Chavis' leadership. Many board members objected to Chavis' invitation to 
Farrakhan, fearing his presence would cast a negative light on the more 
mainstream civil rights organization. The Nation of Islam leader is perceived 
by some blacks and whites as anti-white and anti-Semitic. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chavis scoffed at such concerns, arguing that the NAACP under his 
leadership would not be told what to do. As Farrakhan beamed with obvious 
satisfaction, Chavis repeated that pledge Sunday, saying: "As you heard me say 
at the conclusion of the last summit, never again would we allow forces outside 
of the African American community to dictate to us whom we should meet with, 
when we should meet and what we should meet about." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis said all of the participants of the previous summit were invited back, 
but many of the better known black figures who had attended the previous 
meeting -- including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.) and 
Harvard University professor Cornell West -- were not present at the opening 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the next 2 1/2 days we have a lot of hard work to do," Chavis said, 
noting the attendees would focus on black economic development, youth 
employment and moral development of the African American community. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis said that since he is no longer being held back by the NAACP board, "I 
feel a little liberated right now. I do not have a straitjacket on."

CIRCUS ELEPHANT GOES BERSERK, IS SHOT AFTER KILLING TRAINER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A rampaging circus elephant killed a trainer and injured a groom before she 
was shot down in the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The 21-year-old African elephant named Tyke went berserk just before she was 
to perform with four other elephants in Saturday's matinee. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyke picked up William Beckwith, a groom, and threw him down, then tried to 
stomp his head. A trainer, identified by a circus official as Allen Campbell, 
37, was crushed by the animal as he tried to help Beckwith. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen people were injured as they fled. 
</P>
<P>
 The elephant broke through the main exit and led authorities on a chase of 
several blocks. She was cornered in an industrial area and shot repeatedly 
until she crumpled to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers from the Honolulu Zoo gave her a lethal injection at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The carcass was removed with a crane and taken to the state Department of 
Agriculture for a necropsy. The other elephants were quarantined, said attorney 
Roy Yempuku, who represents Circus International. 
</P>
<P>
 John Cuneo, president of Illinois-based Hawthorne Corp. and owner of the 
elephants, said Sunday that Beckwith had been working with the elephants for 
just over a month and likely startled Tyke by walking behind her. 
</P>
<P>
 He was in fair condition Sunday at The Queen's Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The circus went ahead with its Saturday evening show.

PENTAGON ORDERS SERVICES TO PLAN FOR CUTS IN NEW WEAPON SYSTEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MINTZ, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pentagon's top leadership has ordered the military services to plan for 
the possible cancellation or delay of nearly every large new weapon system in 
the planning or development stages. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memorandum Thursday, Deputy Defense Secretary John M. Deutch asked the 
Army, Navy and Air Force to draw up specific alternatives for the major weapon 
programs planned by the services. The cost savings would pay for "improvements 
in other areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Deutch's memo alarmed the military services and defense contractors, who said 
such cuts could weaken the nation's defenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The memo was intended by Deutch to be "a huge wake-up call" to the military 
services that they will have to delay or eliminate hardware programs or face 
deep cuts in other areas, a Pentagon official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deutch is "telling people to take notice because we have very tough decisions 
coming," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Pentagon officials received the memo Friday, and a number of military and 
industry officials expressed distress when they learned about it over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to hear a lot of screaming" by Air Force officials over the 
proposed delay of up to four years in producing the F-22 jet fighter, an Air 
Force official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deutch, with the support of Defense Secretary William J. Perry, is searching 
for budget cuts because the Pentagon lacks funds to carry out its missions. 
Last month, the General Accounting Office said the Defense Department has 
underestimated its costs and exaggerated its savings, and will find it is $150 
billion short over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The memo doesn't say how much money Deutch wants to save, so it cannot be 
determined how many programs could be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Deutch spared no military branch, and his list includes some of the services' 
most treasured gems: 
</P>
<P>
 The Army was ordered to "develop a program alternative that terminates" the 
only new programs under development, such as the Comanche helicopter and the 
Advanced Field Artillery System. It means the Army will have to settle for only 
upgraded versions of the Apache helicopter and the Paladin artillery system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force, Deutch said, should prepare for possible cancellation of the 
Tri-Service Standoff Attack Missile as well as for a four-year delay in the 
F-22 fighter and a seven-year delay in its Joint Primary Aircraft Training 
System. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy was told to submit plans for slowing production of Arleigh 
Burke-class destroyers and new attack submarines, as well as for canceling the 
Marine Corps's V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft.

VETERAN STUNTMAN CRITICALLY HURT IN FALL AT KNOTT'S SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A veteran stuntman was critically injured in a fall when he missed a padded 
landing spot during a show at Knott's Berry Farm in what officials said Sunday 
was the first serious injury to a performer in the history of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The stuntman, Jay Mead, 29, suffered unspecified injuries Saturday after 
falling 25 feet from a water tower in a mock gunfight during the 2:30 p.m. 
performance of the Calico Square stunt show, officials said.He underwent 
emergency surgery Saturday at UCI Medical Center and remained in critical 
condition in the intensive care unit Sunday, said Bob Ochsner, a Knott's 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Mead was an eight-year veteran of stunt shows at Knott's and had performed the 
fall "hundreds of times," Ochsner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty typical stunt show, and this was just a routine fall," Ochsner 
said. "Stunt work is dangerous, and any fall is somewhat dangerous, but this 
was considered routine." 
</P>
<P>
 During the mock gun battle, several of the performers are "shot" and fall into 
a backstage area out of view of the audience, Ochsner said. The stunt 
performers are supposed to fall in a safe landing area, but Mead apparently 
missed it and fell to the ground, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochsner said this was the first serious injury to a Knott's Berry Farm 
performer in the "50-year-plus history of stunt shows at the farm." 
</P>
<P>
 The Calico Square show was suspended pending the results of an investigation 
into the incident, Ochsner said.

 The pilot of a light private plane that ran out of gas made an emergency 
landing on a Simi Valley street and slammed into a car carrying two Northern 
California tourists, Simi Valley police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Both tourists suffered moderate cuts and bruises but the 18-year-old student 
pilot was uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilot Scott Howard of Big Bear left Palm Springs Airport about 7:30 p.m. 
Saturday to return to Big Bear, but became lost and ended up in Simi Valley, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After running out of fuel, Howard managed to land the Cessna 172 safely on the 
northbound side of Stearns Street, just south of Cochran Street about 10:20 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 But the aircraft struck an oncoming car driven by Janett Kline of Concord, who 
was traveling with her husband, Harvey Kline. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Janett Kline, 32, and Harvey Kline, 41, suffered moderate cuts and 
bruises and were transported to Simi Valley Hospital. She was treated and later 
released, and her husband was listed in stable condition Sunday, officials 
said.

STREET SMART: DON'T CONFRONT PERSON MISUSING HANDICAPPED SPACE, CHP SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: What should motorists do when they see what appears to be a 
physically fit person parking in a handicapped-only parking place using the 
placard placed in their dash? I was in the Pavilions parking lot in Fullerton 
recently and saw a man in a white Honda Accord LX put the blue placard on the 
dash and walk briskly into the store. A short time later, he came out pushing a 
shopping cart with his purchases. I know all handicaps are not readily visible, 
so is there anything a person can do in this situation? 
</P>
<P>
 I have also been puzzled by some old license plates I have seen on relatively 
new cars. The plates are blue background with gold letters and numbers. Some of 
the cars have been new enough to have an anti-collision light in the rear 
window. Can you explain? 
</P>
<P>
 Robert E. Huff, Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding seemingly able-bodied drivers using reserved spaces, Steve Kohler, a 
spokesman for the California Highway Patrol, said the first thing to remember 
is . . . don't confront them. "It's not an individual's duty to enforce the 
law," he said, "but to bring it to the attention of those whose duty it is." 
Citizen confrontations, he said, can sometime lead to violence. And certain 
legitimate disabilities, such as arthritis or heart conditions, might not be 
visible. 
</P>
<P>
 If you suspect someone of faking a handicap, jot down the license number and 
report it to the Department of Motor Vehicles or your local law enforcement 
agency, he said. They will check to see whether the placard or license plate 
designating a handicapped driver is being used legitimately and, if not, take 
appropriate action. Although law enforcement officers cannot cite someone for 
an infraction they didn't witness, Kohler said, they can write letters to the 
registered owners of the vehicles in question informing them of the abuse and 
warning them to desist. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the old license plates on the new cars, Kohler said, these are often 
personalized plates that owners may legally transfer to succeeding cars.

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 My question concerns the diamond lanes on the freeways. What, exactly, do the 
assorted lines separating these lanes from the general traffic mean? I have 
seen the following markings buffering me from the general traffic: broken white 
line, double yellow line and double double yellow line. 
</P>
<P>
 I can figure out the first one, except that some have signs indicating entry 
and some are noted for exiting. I assume I am allowed to perform either act 
without penalty, is this true? 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Bettwy, Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 You may cross a solid double line to move in or out of the lane, but not to 
pass another car, according to Caltrans. You may not cross a double double 
yellow line under any circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 A broken white line, as anywhere else on the freeway, means you may cross when 
it's safe. If signs also are posted, though, their instructions take 
precedence, CHP spokesman Kohler said. If a sign says to exit or enter, cross 
the line only for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Your reply to the inquiry about tinted windows in the Aug. 8 issue brings up 
another question. You stated that out-of-state cars may be cited if they 
violate California restrictions against tinting. Does this extend to the smog 
equipment also? That would mean that any out-of-state car could be cited. How 
is this resolved? 
</P>
<P>
 Also, several years ago California passed a law against pickup trucks that are 
raised to excessive heights. I notice quite a few on the road that the hood of 
my car would slide under in an accident. Why are they not cited when they are 
so obvious? 
</P>
<P>
 John L. Smith, Lake Forest 
</P>
<P>
 Out-of-state cars that do not meet California smog emission standards may be 
driven here as long as they meet federal emission standards, which are lower, 
and as long as the owner has not established legal residency in California. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, people in California on vacation or business may drive their 
own cars without being cited. 
</P>
<P>
 Once they establish legal residency, however, they have 10 days in which to 
register their cars in the state, a process that includes bringing it up to 
California emission standards, Kohler said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the second question, drivers of jacked-up trucks are not always cited, 
Kohler said, for reasons of time and resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't be everywhere at once," he said. "Law enforcement officers have 
many other things to do besides citing big pickups." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the California Vehicle Code, the bottom of a passenger car cannot 
be more than 23 inches from ground and the back of a truck up to 4,500 pounds 
cannot be more than 27 inches from ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "If an officer sees a vehicle exceeding that," Kohler said, "he can definitely 
stop and cite it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a word regarding the county's "smart street" program. The public is 
invited to a series of forums beginning Tuesday to learn about and comment on a 
plan to improve Imperial Highway. The plan includes widening the road, 
coordinating its traffic signals, raising its medians and adding sound walls 
and bus turnouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The first forum will be from 5 to 8 p.m. at Imperial Middle School, 1540 S. 
Schoolwood Drive, La Habra. A second is scheduled for the same time Wednesday 
at the Travis Ranch Activity Center, 5200 Via de la Escuala in Yorba Linda.

 Dear Street Smart: Woodman Avenue between Vanowen and Nordhoff streets is in 
deplorable condition. I think it is the worst street in the San Fernando 
Valley. I was wondering if there were any plans in the near future to resurface 
Woodman? 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Barton, Van Nuys 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: Funny you should ask. Within the next week or two, a 
$1.16-million improvement project along Woodman Avenue between Vanowen Street 
and Roscoe Boulevard is scheduled to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Project engineer Mike Palardy said work should take about six months to 
complete. The worst parts of the road -- about half -- will be torn up and 
rebuilt from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole two-mile stretch, though, will be resurfaced, so you should expect 
smoother driving sometime around next Valentine's Day. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: My question is about the two-way left-turn lanes that are 
part of most wide streets. To my understanding, the center lanes are intended 
to ease the flow of traffic and reduce a lot of hazards that contribute to 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet these lanes are often used by big-rigs as their own private preserve for 
loading and unloading of cars and building equipment. It reduces the flow of 
traffic considerably. 
</P>
<P>
 These big vehicles get in the center lane and then have to move their goods 
across the street to the business, even though there is ample parking on the 
side of the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, I see a police car drive by and do nothing. So maybe this is legal. If 
it is legal, why can't other drivers park in the center lane like big-rigs? 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Weinberg, Van Nuys 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: You are indeed correct that the center lane is intended to reduce 
accidents. The California Vehicle Code permits use of that center lane only for 
the purpose of beginning a turn -- or of passing on a three-lane highway. It is 
not intended as a center parking median. 
</P>
<P>
 While there is no special code pertaining to tractor-trailers and their use of 
this lane, Officer Mel Scholl of the Los Angeles Police Department's Valley 
Traffic Division said it is not uncommon for them to use the lane to unload 
unwieldy cargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is it uncommon for police officers to turn a blind eye to the practice. 
The reason, Scholl said, is safety. He said it is safer to park a rig in the 
middle of the road than to block a traffic lane by parking on the side of the 
street -- especially when unloading large cargo such as automobiles or heavy 
machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this assumes that the auto dealership or company receiving the shipment 
does not have a loading facility of its own and that the rig is unable to 
maneuver to a safer place. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Scholl said, the practice would not be wise in an area where 
motorists frequently use the lane to make turns, say in front of a bank or a 
supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 As to your question about whether ordinary drivers also can use the lane for 
loading and unloading, Scholl said they could as long as there was no other 
safe way to unload their cargo. Those situations -- unless the family car is an 
18-wheeler -- are pretty uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: You would be doing a great public service by starting a 
campaign reminding drivers of the importance of using turn signals. There is no 
doubt in my mind that many accidents could be prevented by improving 
communication between drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Katz, North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: Consider the campaign begun. Your suggestion is good common 
sense, but, sadly, many drivers don't follow it. However, most drivers we see 
are quite adept at communicating. Why just last week, a driver let us know that 
she thinks we are No. 1 -- or at least that's how many fingers she held up -- 
when she thought we were driving too slow on the Ventura Freeway.

 Anyone can take a look at the area around Disneyland in Anaheim and say "NITA

else, such as someplace where the unemployment is high.

 Watch out for Disney, they always want the local entity to supply half the

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; PUBLIC DESERVES ALL THE DETAILS ON EL TORO LAND SWAP 
PROPOSAL; DEVELOPMENT: THE IRVINE CO. MUST PROVIDE MANY ANSWERS AND ASSURANCES 
BEFORE THE IDEA IS ALLOWED TO PROCEED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK P. PETRACCA, Mark P. Petracca of Irvine is an associate professor of 
social science at UC Irvine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before too much enthusiasm is generated for the proposed land swap involving 
undeveloped Irvine Co. land near the Cleveland National Forest and the El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station some very important issues need to be raised and 
questions answered. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important question for South County residents is what does the Irvine 
Co. plan to do with the El Toro base if it obtains it in a land swap? So far 
the company has feigned "absolute neutrality" on the development of a 
commercial airport at El Toro. This, as though a company that is known for 
planning every day down to a single blade of grass hasn't already decided what 
it would like to do with El Toro. Give me a break. The company's "neutrality" 
ought not to be permitted to last much longer. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents of Irvine, Tustin, Lake Forest, Laguna Hills, Laguna Beach and 
Mission Viejo deserve and should demand a forthright answer from the company as 
to its plans for the Marine base before any land swap is agreed to. It is 
impossible to believe that the company hasn't reached at least a preliminary 
decision on land use for El Toro when it claims interest in swapping 10,000 
acres of undeveloped land for it!  
</P>
<P>
 Next, the environmentalists proposing the swap, the Interior and Defense 
departments, and all impacted South County cities should obtain a complete and 
honest appraisal of the two land parcels in question. The agricultural, 
residential and commercial development potential of the El Toro base far 
exceeds value of the Irvine Co.'s land adjacent to the Cleveland National 
Forest, which is already restricted by environmental considerations. The public 
is entitled to know if a land swap is a fair deal for the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, taxpayers currently own the El Toro Base. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond assessing the value of the exchange, the public and elected officials 
must be assured that the Irvine Co. isn't going to sell some portion of the 
Marine base back to the county and its taxpayers for use as an airport. This 
would be a classic Irvine Co. move -- obtain the land, sell it back to the 
county for a big profit and then let county supervisors or members of the reuse 
planning authority take the political heat for development of a commercial 
airport that the company favored all along. Whether or not an airport is built 
at El Toro, county taxpayers should not have to pay for it twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the residents of South County cities should be guaranteed a role in 
any future land-use decisions involving the El Toro base before surrendering to 
the development ambitions of the Irvine Co. This won't be easy to do, since the 
company is a highly skilled advocate. Elected officials rarely say no to Irvine 
Co. executives; even the opposition of community groups can be easily 
neutralized by effective lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
 No decision involving future land use at the El Toro site should be made 
without the full and direct involvement of the public. Our elected municipal, 
county, state and federal officials should demand no less than this on the 
public's behalf.

INDEPENDENTS' DAY AT THE BALLPARK; BOTTOM RUNG OF MINOR LEAGUES IS LAST-CHANCE 
STOP FOR PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER and MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Smedes wasn't going to waste this opportunity when the call came a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 " Outfield? Yeah, I can play the outfield. Like Willie Mays, I can play the 
outfield. "  
</P>
<P>
 OK, he lied. Smedes had never strolled past the infield dirt in his entire 
baseball career. He was a first baseman and pitcher at Laguna Hills High School 
and Oklahoma. A fly, to him, was something you swatted with a rolled-up 
newspaper. But the guy on the other end of the phone didn't know that. 
</P>
<P>
 The caller was a coach for the Duluth-Superior Dukes, an independent team in 
the Northern League. He needed an outfielder and Smedes needed a team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was on the phone every day with scouts and coaches," Smedes said. "Here was 
one who called me. If they wanted an outfielder, then sure, I was an 
outfielder." 
</P>
<P>
 Smedes would do anything to stay in the game. He got his chance with an 
independent team. Today, he is a right fielder -- and a decent one -- for the 
Erie Sailors, one of eight independent teams in the Frontier League. 
</P>
<P>
 To many, this is the bottom rung of professional baseball. Teams made up of 
castoffs and wanna-bes, all just a swing-and-a-miss from slow-pitch softball. 
</P>
<P>
 But to those involved, that is a misconception. Independent teams, which are 
not affiliated with a major league franchise, offer a chance to play and have 
some fun. Maybe even a chance to be seen by a scout and -- dare they say -- get 
picked up by a major league organization. That's a golden opportunity, one 
players have to shoot for, even it means playing outfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a mess out there last season," said Smedes, one of 10 Orange County 
products currently playing for independents. "One time a ball was hit and I was 
sure it was over my head. I turned around and ran. When I looked back, it 
landed 20 feet in front of me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, it was a struggle. But as long as I'm playing, the dream is still 
alive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it's a dream. Sometimes it's a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Duane Page was pitching for the St. Paul Saints and who steps up to the plate 
but Pedro Guerrero. The Pedro Guerrero, former Dodger, now designated hitter 
for the Sioux Falls Canaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared," said Page, a graduate of Ocean View High School. "I was 
thinking, 'Wow, I'm pitching to Pedro Guerrero. This guy was good enough to bat 
.300, hit 20 home runs and drive in 90 runs every year.' I was a little 
intimidated. He lined a single on the first pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 Page then thought things over. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came up again and I realized he may have had major league talent once, but 
now he was on the same level as me," Page said. 
</P>
<P>
 Page struck out Guerrero the next three times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the talent level depends on who's pitching that day," said Page, 
who was released by St. Paul and picked up by the Thunder Bay Whiskey Jacks 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the two pitchers have rookie league experience, then the talent is that of 
rookie league. If they have triple-A experience, then the talent will be equal 
to triple-A." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are some "name" players. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Cub Leon Durham plays in the Northern League, for the St. Paul Saints. 
Former Boston Red Sox pitcher Oil Can Boyd was with the Sioux City Explorers 
before an injury forced his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the likes of former Cal State Fullerton outfielder Chris 
Powell. A year ago, he was tearing up a Fullerton slow-pitch softball league. 
Now he's with Sioux Falls and leading the Northern League with a .376 batting 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have guys here like Pedro, who just love playing baseball," said Gary 
Weckwerth, Sioux Falls general manager. "Then you get a guy like Chris Powell, 
who was snubbed by the draft." 
</P>
<P>
 They were all found through tryouts, personal contacts and, of course, the 
waiver wire. Independent teams leave no stone unturned in the search for 
talent. Marty Neff, a graduate of Magnolia High, was released by the Pittsburgh 
Pirates during spring training, then answered a cattle-call tryout at 
Pepperdine, which drew 300 players. Neff was signed by the Sioux City 
Explorers. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't take much to make a team, just a little talent and luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Rancho Santiago pitcher Paul O'Hearn was not drafted in June, even 
after going 9-1 at North Alabama last spring. Nor was he looking to play 
professionally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was planning to get a part-time job and hang out at the beach this summer," 
said O'Hearn, a Saddleback High graduate. "I was going to enjoy myself." 
</P>
<P>
 He's enjoying himself, all right. 
</P>
<P>
 In Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ogden Raptors held a tryout in Long Beach in May. A North Alabama teammate 
came west to participate and stayed with O'Hearn. On the third day, he told 
O'Hearn to come out. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told the manager about me and said that I was better than any of the guys 
they had," O'Hearn said. "I struck out six consecutive batters and broke the 
bat of the seventh guy. They offered me a contract right there." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hearn is 7-3 for the Raptors, the only independent in the Pioneer League. 
The Raptors are two games behind the Helena Brewers in the Southern Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be great if we win it," O'Hearn said. "Guys from other teams try to 
big-league us. They are with an organization, so they think they're better than 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those guys all make more money than us, but we can play with them." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hearn made that clear recently by shutting out the Great Falls Dodgers, 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Independent teams have had some success financially. Enough, anyway, that more 
have popped up. A year ago, the six-team Northern League was the only 
all-independent league. This season, the eight-team Frontier and eight-team 
Texas-Louisiana leagues were formed. Next season, a league is planned for 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent teams also dot the standings of many minor leagues with affiliated 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "People here were a little skeptical of us first," said Pat Brown, general 
manager of the Erie Sailors. "Once they gave the team a chance, it snowballed. 
They saw the quality of play and the promotions we were doing and they came out 
to the park." 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance at Northern League games is booming as well. St. Paul, which is 
co-owned by Bill Murray, fills its 6,000-seat stadium almost every game. This 
for a team that is playing .500 ball. 
</P>
<P>
 If they don't come for the team, they at least come for a massage. A big crowd 
favorite is Sister Rosalind, a Roman Catholic nun who doubles as a masseuse. 
Fans can get a back rub while watching St. Paula, the team pig, carry baseballs 
in a pouch to the home plate umpire. 
</P>
<P>
 Silly, yes. But what do you expect from a team whose president is Mike Veeck, 
son of shameless promoter and former Chicago White Sox owner Bill Veeck? 
</P>
<P>
 All teams in the league are averaging 2,000 fans or better. Winnipeg's 
Goldeyes, the first-half champions, draw 5,800 per game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We succeeded beyond anyone's imagination," Weckwerth said. "We're on a pace 
to hit 1 million fans for six teams in our second year. Everybody looked to see 
what we did." 
</P>
<P>
 What they did best was keep things cheap. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Powell is living the good life these days, making $1,025 per month -- a small 
fortune by independent team standards. He also lives rent-free with what he 
describes as a well-to-do family. Everything he makes, he pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a three-story house and a van they let me use," said Powell, who 
helped Fullerton reach the 1992 College World Series championship game. "All I 
have to do is baby sit their kids once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone has it so sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm at the whim of anyone who has a car," Page said. "If someone is going to 
eat, I have to go with them, even if I'm not hungry. It may be my only chance 
to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 The competition and expectations may be high, but the budgets are low. Some 
teams, in fact, are downright democratic when it comes to money. Everyone at 
Ogden makes $650 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northern League operates under a salary cap of $76,000 per team -- are you 
listening out there Donald Fehr? The money -- about two-thirds the major league 
minimum salary -- is divvied up according to experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero makes $2,000 per month. Page, with only one year of rookie league 
behind him, makes $650. It can be a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was earning frequent flier miles with Western Union there for a while," 
Page said. "I was calling home for money quite a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 "After taxes, I take home $290 every two weeks. With that I have to take care 
of rent, food, cable . . . all the necessities." 
</P>
<P>
 Cable? A necessity? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no money for going to the movies," Page said. "You play baseball, eat 
and watch TV." 
</P>
<P>
 At least there's money for food. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, you eat a lot of Taco Bell 59-cent value meals," Page said. "Toward the 
end of the month, you have to do without a few personal items, like deodorant 
and toilet paper. It can get a little rough." 
</P>
<P>
 But Page roughs it. He was released by the Seattle Mariners' organization 
during spring training. But, no matter how difficult it gets in Thunder Bay, he 
is playing professional baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I sit back and think about leaving," he said. "You could go home 
and make more money working at a fast food joint. Then I realize what's 
important to me and that's to play baseball and try to get back in an 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are those looking to jump-start a career. Then there is former Cal State 
Fullerton shortstop Kevin Farlow. 
</P>
<P>
 Farlow, 25, has had his fill of affiliated teams. He has been released by the 
San Diego Padres and Angels, but has found his niche with Sioux City. He earns 
a little cash during the summer and attends college. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have rookies who didn't get picked in the draft and they're hungry," said 
Farlow, a member of the Titans' 1990 College World Series team. "Then you have 
guys like me, who had our taste of organized ball. We're just out here to have 
fun and win a championship. We're here because we love the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Weckwerth: "We're not here to develop players. We want to put winners on 
the field and provide winners for communities. We could care less about scouts, 
player directors and agents." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, management has its agenda. Players have theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can spot a scout in the stands easy," said Smedes, who was an eighth-round 
pick out of high school. "We're all hoping." 
</P>
<P>
 Those hopes have been realized in the past. Major league teams will pick up 
talent from independents and, once in a while, those players make it. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Fortugno was cut by Philadelphia in 1989. He had a wife and a child. 
Still, he kept pitching for the Reno Silver Sox, then an independent, for $500 
a month. 
</P>
<P>
 A Milwaukee Brewer scout spotted him and liked his stuff. The Brewers 
purchased Fortugno's contract for $2,500 and 12 dozen baseballs. Fortugno 
eventually made it to the major leagues with the Angels and is now with the 
Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 So perhaps there's hope for the likes of Zack Raney, an Amarillo 
(Texas-Louisiana) pitcher who was recently traded to Beaumont for three dozen 
baseballs and a bat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've bought players from independent teams in the past," Angel General 
Manager Bill Bavasi said. "We don't scour those leagues, but we watch for 
talent." 
</P>
<P>
 That slim chance keeps a lot of players playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of guys want to go on to be a fireman, a policeman or something," Neff 
said. "They're just looking for that one last chance. I'd like to catch 
somebody's eye." 
</P>
<P>
 It might happen. Then again, it might not. Either way, they play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just go out and have fun," Powell said. "What else can you do?"

A RETURN TO OBSCURITY; UCLA'S SCHMID GOES BACK TO COLLEGE COACHING AFTER HIS 
MOMENT IN WORLD CUP SUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How easy it would have been, how predictable and how wrongheaded for him to 
allow himself to believe what so many others hoped would come true. That the 
American sporting public, exposed to world-class soccer for the first time 
during this summer's World Cup, would at last embrace the planet's most popular 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Sigi Schmid is far too careful to have invested in that. Even with his 
first-hand observation of the recent soccer boomlet, as an assistant coach for 
the U.S. World Cup team, Schmid knew that his beloved game would soon be 
accorded the same lowly status it has mostly enjoyed in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Schmid knew that after experiencing the what-can-we-do-for-you? attitude 
toward the U.S. World Cup team when he returned to his job as head coach of the 
UCLA men's team, it would be back to: What do you want? Business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming back was a little bit like coming back from vacation," Schmid said. 
"You had a great time. All of a sudden you come back and it's like, wow, real 
life sets back in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a greater awareness of soccer than there was, but I didn't 
expect that I'd get back to UCLA and I'd get into line ahead of (Jim) Harrick 
or (Terry) Donahue to see (Athletic Director Pete) Dalis. I know I'm in line 
behind them, and maybe a couple of others. I have to be realistic that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Trained as a certified public accountant, Schmid is a realist. Entering his 
15th year as coach at UCLA, he has compiled a 231-45-32 record, winning 80% of 
his games and two NCAA titles. With the certainty gained from coaching a minor 
collegiate sport, Schmid knows that in his best season, his team will gain less 
attention than the football team during its worst. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was exciting, if only for a month, to live in a world in which your 
team and your sport were major and the rest minor. Like a parallel universe 
where, instead of being a futbol coach, he had the status of a football coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the World Cup, you walk into a hotel and you're the thing," Schmid 
said. "You have dinner with a sponsor or whoever, and you are the person they 
want to talk to. Now, you realize that's not the case anymore. When we go on 
our first road trip and show up at the hotel, people aren't really going to 
care who we are. I've still got to check the bags on the plane." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA began its practices last week and the glamour of the World Cup quickly 
faded as Schmid settled into the anonymity and grind of another season. 
Forgotten was the drudgery of paperwork mandated by the NCAA and the lack of 
individual attention from university employees who are also swamped with work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you what does get boring, coming back into UCLA and dealing with a 
letter from the NCAA that says the stripes on the adidas uniform are not legal 
to the NCAA standard. Is this really an important issue?" Schmid said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a public school there is more red tape and more road blocks. The World Cup 
was a unique experience because you almost didn't have to ask about things. If 
you thought about it, you ended up getting it. That's not going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 If Schmid, 41, admits to being slightly spoiled as a World Cup coach, he's 
smart enough to have put some World Cup lessons to use at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Working under the impetuous Bora Milutinovic was always challenging for 
someone as highly organized as Schmid. But Milutinovic's skill at motivation 
and his intuitive handling of the team off the field were important lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I will also be more comfortable altering the lineup than before," 
Schmid said. "Bora was always changing the lineup. It takes you outside your 
comfort zone, and that's good." 
</P>
<P>
 Schmid is now back to full-time college coaching after splitting his time for 
two years. Schmid took his first trip with the national team in the fall of 
1992, a swing through Germany that caused him to miss the first six days of 
UCLA's practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if that was a problem for the team or school administration, Schmid 
shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always had a philosophy here that we let our players go to the national 
team and try and release them if we can possibly do it," he said. "I told my 
players: 'If you guys had the opportunity to go with the World Cup team right 
now, you'd go.' They didn't want to deny me the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Schmid, who was born in the former West Germany, impressed Milutinovic on the 
trip with his fluency in the language and his comprehensive knowledge of 
European soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 In January of 1993, Schmid spent a month with the national team as the 
training center in Mission Viejo opened. Two weeks into that, Bill Nuttall, 
then the team's general manager, told Schmid that Milutinovic wanted him as an 
assistant. Schmid then embarked on a grueling split shift -- two days a week at 
Mission Viejo and three days a week at UCLA. After the college season, Schmid 
joined the World Cup team full time. 
</P>
<P>
 Did he reach the point of diminishing returns with both jobs? Did the UCLA 
program suffer, even in the off-season, with Schmid not around to make 
recruiting calls? 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of recruiting, parents are more comfortable sending their son or 
daughter to the the school with the coach they talked to most and who has the 
most interest and concern," Schmid said. "In order to do that you have to have 
the time available to be seen and be on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last six or seven months it's definitely hurt a little bit. (The 
national team) is something that I'll continue to be involved with, a trip here 
or there where it's feasible. It's probably in the best interest of the 
national team and UCLA for me to make a choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to be as active as I can in both but I have to pay respect to where 
my paycheck comes from. I've got to feed my kids. But I've always been the sort 
of person who, in order to do the best job I can do, I need to be motivated. In 
order to be motivated I have to be challenged." 
</P>
<P>
 The argument can also be made that Schmid brings more attention to UCLA as an 
assistant on a national team than as head coach of the college program. With 
UCLA's record of representation on Olympic and World Cup teams -- six players 
on the 1992 Olympic team, four on the 1990 World Cup team and five on the 1994 
team -- the school must benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Since national teams are the ultimate goals for soccer players in the United 
States, players tend to want to go to schools that seem to be able to place 
them there.  
</P>
<P>
 Even if Schmid was not as active in recruiting as he had wished, it wasn't as 
necessary this season, with about 75% of his players back from last year's 18-3 
team. Those players flock to UCLA because of its tradition and its coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We train with intensity," Schmid said. "We try and teach our players to raise 
the level of their training so they can raise the level of their play. We do 
not accept mediocrity." 
</P>
<P>
 After seeing what he has seen, after living in a world where soccer is 
everything, Schmid will have even a lower tolerance than ever for anything less 
than the best. Even if it is a dream.

VISITING ROYALTY; ALTHOUGH ONE OF THE RAINIEST PLACES ON EARTH, QUEEN CHARLOTTE 
ISLANDS ARE A FISHING PARADISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fishmaster flings his harpoon, but fails to deliver the death blow. 
</P>
<P>
 Only grazed, the big fish goes berserk and high-tails it below.  
</P>
<P>
 The fisherman, his knuckles rapped by the uncontrollable spinning of the 
reel's crank, sighs heavily. 
</P>
<P>
 Still hooked up, he's back at square one with this monster, face contorted and 
arms aching, trying as he has for the better part of an hour to keep his rod 
tip up, though it remains bent in a giant loop, dipping into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fishmaster, and another fisherman aboard the little boat, there is 
little to do but take another look around. 
</P>
<P>
 The setting is surreal. 
</P>
<P>
 The creaking of the boat as it rocks gently over the slow-rolling swells. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearby skiffs with their fishermen silhouetted by the sun, which rests on 
the horizon, using the wispy clouds to paint fiery streaks across the sky. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an occasional flash of silver, meaning another king salmon has 
reached the end of the line. 
</P>
<P>
 It's 10 o'clock at night, for crying out loud! What kind of place is this? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These are the Queen Charlotte Islands, located 60 miles off British Columbia 
just south of the Alaskan Panhandle, pointing in a southerly direction for 
about 150 miles. More immediately, this is the rugged and remote west coast of 
Graham Island, the largest and northernmost of the Queen Charlottes, where the 
sun rises at 4:30 a.m. and doesn't set until 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Charlottes are not about sunshine as much as they are about wind and 
rain. One of the stormiest places on earth -- the region is often referred to 
as the Mother of Storms -- it is also one of the wettest, with nearly 200 
inches of rain falling on the west coast annually. 
</P>
<P>
 And because of this, the Charlottes are one of the more beautiful places on 
earth, with meandering waterways, pure and rich, amid forests of velvet. 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest draw of the Charlottes are the salmon that visit the shores. 
The Chinooks, or kings, are the first to arrive in the spring. Then Coho show, 
followed by the sockeye, chum and pink. The kings stay all summer, averaging 
15-20 pounds in May and 30-50 pounds in August and September. 
</P>
<P>
 "In August, you have the opportunity to catch all five species," says Dan 
Sewell, 45, of Sewell's Marine Group in Vancouver.  
</P>
<P>
 You can also catch halibut so big and strong that you'll need a harpoon to 
subdue them and a crane to lift them. Rockfish in all sizes, shapes and colors 
are so plentiful they are considered pests. 
</P>
<P>
 Access to the west coast of Graham Island is limited, which is why Sewell and 
Derek Rendle bought the Charlotte Explorer a few years back. A former seismic 
research vessel, the sleek, 190-foot black ship is spending this summer 
anchored in Nesto Inlet, a narrow finger-shaped bay minutes from some of the 
best salmon fishing in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship has been converted to a floating lodge, complete with maid service, 
lounges and sun decks, and fitted with everything -- including a fleet of 
18-foot outboards -- necessary to tackle some of the tastiest fish in the sea. 
The outboards enable the anglers to fish on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Ulveland, 38, a hospital administrator from Ponoka, Alberta, has been to 
the Charlottes four times. Being able to fish without supervision is what 
attracted him to the Charlotte Explorer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to go halibut fishing, you go halibut fishing," he says. "They've 
even got the little book organized that tells you where the hot spots are. They 
tell you where they're getting the strikes and that's where they're at!" 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Adams, another fisherman from Alberta, has a different reason for coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just so awed by the wilderness," he says. "You're up here with nothing. 
There's nobody around or nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 So after shelling out $1,500-$2,000 for trips of varying lengths, fishermen 
can leave the world as they know it and visit what seems another, almost 
mystical world. Where bald eagles are perched like sentinels in their tree-top 
lofts. Where huge black bears and little deer sometimes peer through the forest 
to see what all the commotion is about. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among those aboard the Charlotte Explorer, besides Ulveland, are Nigel Malkin, 
a dry cleaner from West Vancouver, and his sidekick, Pete Hayes; Art and Scott 
Whittlesey, father and son from Bellevue, Wash., and Robert and Gary Wales, 
father and son from Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 They and most of the 20 others are standing at the stern of the ship. The deck 
is littered with salmon, halibut and rockfish after the first full day of 
fishing.  
</P>
<P>
 Toby Barrett is fileting fish and plopping luscious red slabs of salmon and 
white slabs of halibut on a conveyor belt. Mike Mahoney is down the line, 
vacuum-sealing the fillets as they come off the belt. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Whittlesey, 10, is trying to hold up his first two fish of the day -- 
king salmon weighing 17 and 30 pounds. With his right hand in the gills of one 
and the left hand in the gills of the other, he lifts with all his might, but 
the tails of the fish don't make it off the deck. 
</P>
<P>
 "These fish are too big," Whittlesey says between breaths, his father watching 
with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Malkin, a thin 30-year-old with a British accent, is clutching a beer and 
watching Barrett turn his 46-pound halibut, two 21-pound salmon and a 14-pound 
lingcod into freezer meat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a bloody supermarket out there," he says. "Three times we had 
double hookups, but we'd get them to the boat and say, 'Naw,' and let them go. 
But I got a couple of pounds of fish today, 102 pounds of fish in one day. 
</P>
<P>
 Malkin is particularly proud of the halibut, the biggest he has ever caught.  
</P>
<P>
 But Martin Paish, a Sewell's employee and designated fishmaster on the 
Charlotte Explorer, says the fish is barely a keeper.  
</P>
<P>
 "Last year we had a couple catch a 263-pounder," Paish says. "It took them two 
hours to get it up, but it had to be lifted aboard the ship by crane." 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett, still slicing away, interrupts with a story about another group that 
hooked a halibut that was probably closer to 300 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it came up to surface they harpooned it once and it sucked the (attached 
buoy, an inflated ball) back down for about 10 minutes," Barrett says, waving 
his knife. "The ball popped back up and they put another (harpoon) through it 
and it went down and came back up five minutes later. They put a third harpoon 
ball through it and it went down again -- and it never came back up." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the fishermen, worn out by a long day on the water, have retreated to 
their berths. Malkin and Hayes are drinking beer.  
</P>
<P>
 Rock D'Acquisto, a lure maker from Port Townsend, Wash., and his companion, 
Chris Meyer, are the last ones in, having caught and released about a dozen 
king salmon with the lures D'Acquisto makes, keeping a few 25-pounders and two 
large halibut, one that dwarfs Malkin's, tipping the scale at 47 and 73 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you one thing," Meyer says, his face reddened by the wind and rain. 
"These fish sure fight better in the saltwater." 
</P>
<P>
 How quickly the passengers seem to have forgotten how fortunate they are, that 
in the days leading up to their arrival the Mother of Storms was busy tossing 
the Charlotte Explorer around as though it were the S.S. Minnow and making life 
hell for passengers and crew. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All of Graham Island had been basically shut down. The passengers -- they are 
normally flown from Vancouver to Sandspit, a small town on the east coast of 
Morseby Island, then ferried by seaplane the short distance to the ship -- had 
to be ferried aboard a school bus from Sandspit to the east coast of Graham 
Island and driven in a driving rain for two hours on a logging road to a 
deserted beach on the west coast.  
</P>
<P>
 Light aircraft were grounded because of 87-m.p.h. winds so the Charlotte 
Explorer had to pick the group up, which was fine with Captain Michael W. Scott 
because the ship couldn't hold anchor in the rough seas, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we were in blinding rain . . . we couldn't see anything," Scott said 
later. "I was just trying not to touch the rocks." 
</P>
<P>
 Crewmen Mahoney and Bill Brown were left behind at the portable dock, with 
orders to try to keep the skiffs secure. They tried to sleep in the bottoms of 
the open boats, but the wind and rain that raged over them was too much. They 
were soggy and cold.  
</P>
<P>
 Brown got out of one boat and scrambled to a barrel used to burn trash. The 
barrel, full of coals, was still smoldering but offered little relief from the 
cold. Brown added some gasoline and started stirring, creating an explosion 
that blew him into the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown made it out OK, but was scared and shivering when the ship returned. Two 
of the 18-foot skiffs were torn from the docks and blown about 500 yards, 
coming to rest near the end of the inlet. 
</P>
<P>
 The winds continued the next day, so fierce that huge walls of water and mist 
-- called spindrifts -- blew across the narrow bay. The passengers tried 
between squalls to fish, but only managed to get out a few times, catching a 
few salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm didn't let up until it was time for the group to leave. It was flown 
by helicopter to the same beach from which it had been picked up. The new 
group, having taken the same yellow bus instead of the seaplanes and fearing 
the worst, was there to greet them. 
</P>
<P>
 "An absolute nightmare," says one of the men, his face red and unshaven, his 
hair a mess. "When I get home I'm going to write a book about this. . . . I'm 
not kidding. It was an absolute disaster ." 
</P>
<P>
 In groups of four, the new group was ferried through the mist to the Charlotte 
Explorer. A steady rain was pelting the ship. The Mother of Storms was having 
her say.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is a new day on the ship. Life has become as routine here as it is back 
home. But then there is no stress associated with rigging a herring for bait or 
casting a lure. Or having your knuckles rapped by the cranks of these darned 
free-wheeling salmon reels. 
</P>
<P>
 Trolling around Hippa Rocks across from Hippa Island, or exploring the coast 
of the island itself, has become a way of life. It's warm and sunny one minute, 
cold and rainy the next. But the rain isn't a problem -- they give you thick 
rubber suits and boots. And if the wind is bothersome, shelter is usually close 
by. 
</P>
<P>
 By 7 a.m., dozens of salmon, from 15-35 pounds, have already been landed. A 
large one is giving Gary Smith a run for his money, leaping out of the water 
while trying to shake the hook. But the fisherman from Arlington, Wash., 
maintains a tight line and soon has his fish to the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Whittlesey has the hang of things and no longer needs his father's 
assistance. He spots a school of fish on the meter, drops one of D'Acquisto's 
lures, hooks a fish and fights it solo for 20 minutes. His father nets the 
plump salmon and young Whittlesey high-fives and hugs his father. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Acquisto and Meyer, having proved to be the most experienced anglers of the 
group, are off on their own, having a field day with salmon and halibut. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are exploring the island, its sheltered coves are so pristine it is as 
if the explorer is also the discoverer. Gliding silently over a glassy sea that 
mirrors the steep peaks and craggy outcroppings, one can easily see amber 
strands of kelp rising from the ocean floor, nearly as lush as the green 
forests of firs and spruce on land.  
</P>
<P>
 Some are fishing slightly beyond the wreck of the Clarkesdale Victory, a 
freighter that was broken in half when it ran aground during a storm in the 
winter of 1947, killing more than 30 sailors. Nearly half of the masted ship is 
still intact, a ghostly reminder of the severity of Queen Charlotte winters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's getting late and many of the fishermen have returned to the ship, 
exhausted. But one can't return. He remains hooked up to a big fish that more 
than an hour ago got a glimpse of what the world above the waterline is all 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the pressure is getting to the fish, it also appears to be getting to 
the fisherman. He is breathing heavily, arms quivering. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally the fish begins to rise, as it did before. The fishmaster grabs the 
harpoon and checks the tip to make sure the pointed barb is loose. The big fish 
now seems to have lost its will to fight. It comes into view -- a big, brown 
hulk -- and is soon back at the surface.  
</P>
<P>
 The fishmaster flings his spear, striking the fish behind the head -- a 
perfect shot. The fish dives, breaking the fishing line and taking the pink 
inflated ball over the rail. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball pops back up immediately, floating but not moving. The fish, it 
seems, has escaped for good. The fisherman can't believe it. A hand reaches 
down to grab the ball and begins to pull the rope to which it is attached. But 
the rope is ripped from the hand and the ball is sucked back down and out of 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 10 minutes pass with no sign of the ball. The sun is finally setting 
and the sky is pink. Finally, the ball surfaces, again at the bow. A hand 
reaches to grab it, but this time there is no fight. A huge halibut is pulled 
to the surface and gaffed by the fishmaster.  
</P>
<P>
 The fish is safe on the boat, the fisherman is more relieved than anything. 
The fishmaster fires up the engine and heads back to the ship. There's still a 
small crowd on the deck. The fishermen watch as the fish tips the scale at 84 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "That one's a keeper," Paish says.

CUTTING THEM OFF WITH THE PASS; THE POSSE, LAS VEGAS' CFL FRANCHISE, COMES UP 
SHORT WITH ITS FIELD -- BUT HAS BEEN LONG ON CONTROVERSY 
</P>

<P>
 Oh, Canada, did they get letters. 
</P>
<P>
 They came by fax, cable, express mail. Some were cryptic; others official 
denouncements double-spaced on parliament parchment. 
</P>
<P>
 G.E. Alexander, Regina, Saskatchewan: " 'O Canada' is NOT sung to the tune of 
'O Christmas Tree. . . .' 
</P>
<P>
 Alice G. Burrows, Coquitlam, British Columbia: "I must protest the 
bastardization of the Canadian Anthem. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Abbott, member of Parliament, Kootenay East: "I was absolutely disgusted 
with the pitiful insulting performance of the Canadian National anthem on 
television on Saturday night. . . . If we continue to exhibit a lack of pride 
in Canada, the greatest nation on earth, and passively allow the absolute 
butchering of our fine national anthem, we deserve to be the laughingstock of 
the United States, and I for one won't stand for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Noreen Main, Regina: "Well, you people have done it again. First, it was the 
flag upside down at the World Series. Now we have a singer who cannot carry a 
tune, who sings the Canadian national anthem to his tune and his words. What an 
insult to all Canadians." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Meade gathered the stack of letters from his desk and returned them to a 
file. After a distinguished career in newspapers and public relations, Meade, 
66, had retired to Minnesota to write a novel when he was called back to head 
up publicity for the Las Vegas Posse, one of three 1994 expansion franchises 
awarded the United States by the foundering Canadian Football League. 
</P>
<P>
 Meade had not planned to become the Red Adair of public relations 
fire-fighting. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The CFL crossed the border into Sacramento last year and this season put down 
stakes in Baltimore, Shreveport, La., and Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Self-respecting Canadians turned their heads for last December's official 
naming of the Las Vegas' franchise. For the team's unveiling at the Lady Luck 
Hotel, a bare-bottomed magician known as Melinda -- First Lady of Magic -- was 
shot out of a cannon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Posse, purchased last July for $3 million by Ohio businessman Nick Mileti, 
held training camp at the Riviera Hotel, which tore up a parking lot and built 
the Posse a practice field adjacent to its casino. During camp, the team's 
assistant equipment manager won $2,200 in jackpots over two days. 
</P>
<P>
 Coached by NFL-savvy Ron Meyer, the Posse does not have a Canadian-born player 
on its 37-man roster. Canadian-based teams are required to have at least 20 
"non-imports" on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of size limitations at Sam Boyd Stadium, the Posse does not play on a 
standard CFL-sized field. The end zones are 15 yards deep, five shorter than 
regulation, and the playing width is two yards narrower than the standard 65 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes for cramped quarters. One opposing team complained the Posse's 
showgirls were distracting players on the sidelines during the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Mileti encourages gambling on his team and was thrilled when local bookmakers 
began posting betting lines. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Posse -- one of the few publicly held sports franchises -- has 
proved a good bet. At the team's stock offering, 650,000 units sold out in 
minutes. With the $7 million raised, Mileti paid off his debts and began the 
season $3 1/2 million in the black. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Game-time temperature for the team's June 29 exhibition opener against 
Edmonton was 115 degrees, 146 on the artificial turf. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an 8 p.m. start. 
</P>
<P>
 "The heat is highly overrated," Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an opposing viewpoint, Edmonton Eskimos quarterback Damon Allen said 
afterward it felt like "the Devil was breathing fireballs at me." 
</P>
<P>
 That was Canadian bacon compared to the Posse's July 16 regular-season home 
opener against Saskatchewan, when Dennis Casey Park of Fullerton stepped to the 
microphone and let fly "O Canada." 
</P>
<P>
 Park mangled both tune and lyric. 
</P>
<P>
 The singer, in fact, had been a last-minute anthem replacement for the 
step-son of John Chura, a Posse assistant coach. Apparently a late-night 
television psychic intervened and demanded a more accomplished singer to pair 
with Dionne Warwick, who sang "The Star-Spangled Banner." 
</P>
<P>
 Park came billed as a seasoned pro, son of a circus acrobat. He had been in 
show business since age 3, once toured with Bob Hope and sang a medley before 
112,000 fans at the opening ceremonies of the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, 
South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Park had also played Vegas before, but does not subscribe to the stereotype. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a Vegas singer," he said recently from his home in Fullerton. "I'm 
not a lounge singer. I'm not Wayne Newton." 
</P>
<P>
 That night, Park sang like Nate Newton. Wailing a cappella, he made a 
monumental mistake by not properly gauging the delay and distortion of his 
voice's echo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get the first two or three notes out, then right back in my ear I heard all 
those old, used, no-good notes coming back," he said. "I just wish I had an 
identical twin to blame it on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Park couldn't get out of town fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the people who were insulted, I let them know it was unfortunate, that I 
was sorry,' Park said. "I understand completely. I knew where they were coming 
from." 
</P>
<P>
 Mileti says Park will never again attempt a high-C at Posse games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not so much that he was a 'Vegas' guy, but I think he didn't know the 
song," said Mileti, who wrote a letter of apology to the Canadian prime 
minister. "It was a nightmare. Embarrassing. Everything about it was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 What could be worse? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, there were those horse droppings on the playing field. The Posse mascot 
is an equestrian group called the Posse Nine, which entertains during pre-game 
and halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Referee: "OK, Saskatchewan, which goal do you want to defend?" 
</P>
<P>
 Saskatchewan: "The one up wind." 
</P>
<P>
 Roughrider Coach Ray Jauch feared the horses were going to trample his 
players. "Get those damn horses away from us," he kept yelling. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheerleaders posed another problem. Because wider Canadian fields mean less 
sideline room, Posse showgirls often ended up too close to the opposing bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our guys are young, and they were hot and sweaty," Jauch told the Toronto 
Globe and Mail. "Naturally, they're going to look at the young ladies and take 
their minds off the game for at least a few seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 Once, the cheerleaders had to be chased out of the end zone during play. 
</P>
<P>
 Saskatchewan filed a complaint with the CFL. 
</P>
<P>
 As if that wasn't enough, the Posse can't draw horseflies to their games. The 
team averaged 11,025 fans for its first three games in a 32,000-seat stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce, a waitress at the Hotel San Remo and a big football fan, summed it up 
when asked if she would be attending that night's game between the Posse and 
Baltimore CFLers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell, no," she said. "It's too damn hot." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the football fallout had since settled in the Nevada desert. 
</P>
<P>
 After considerable barnstorming, Dennis Park made his peace with outraged 
Canadians. Park served penance by granting 70 mea culpa interviews with radio 
and television stations, and Canada called off the dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 July 28, Park was invited to Hamilton, Ontario, to made amends before a 
Tiger-Cat game against Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 He was escorted by limousine to the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe so they could have a running car waiting for me," Park joked. "I just 
wanted to go do it and do it right." 
</P>
<P>
 This time, backed by a keyboard, Park knocked the crowd dead with a rousing 
performance and received a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was almost worth going through just to go to Canada," said Park, whose 
career might have actually been aided by the publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Live and learn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Posse finally got a handle on its horse problem. First, the horses' diet 
was regulated before the games. Second, in what has turned out to be a 
publicity coup, the team commissioned a cleanup crew since dubbed the "Posse 
Pooper Scoopers" who, for $5 an hour, scamper onto the field, do their job and 
even cleanse the carpet with an anti-bacterial solution. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Pooper Scoopers" have played to rave reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 To solve the cheerleader dilemma, the team constructed platforms in the stands 
on which they now cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 And the players? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm from Chicago," said Len Williams, a street-wise rookie quarterback. "But 
everything here is 24 hours a day. You can get sucked in. But I think we've 
handled it well." 
</P>
<P>
 Practices, for one, were moved from evening to morning, a ploy Williams 
believes was deliberate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think coach changed because guys were staying out all night, waking up at 2 
p.m. and coming in sluggish." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said he knows of only one Posse player who has lost his paycheck to 
gambling. Fortunately, CFL players, who average about $30,000 in salary, have 
little disposable income to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 The publicity department proudly reports no Posse player arrests or DUIs to 
date. 
</P>
<P>
 "The distractions don't bother us," Posse Coach Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recognizable player on the roster is former Colorado star Darian 
Hagan -- and he is only the third-string quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Vegas lost three in a row after a 2-0 start, but few doubt Meyer, 53, is 
the man to lead the Posse (3-4) through the desert. Meyer is a local hero, 
having resurrected the UNLV football program in the early 1970s. He has fielded 
winning teams at every stop since: at Southern Methodist from 1976 through '81; 
with the NFL's New England Patriots from 1982 through '84, and with the 
Indianapolis Colts from 1986 through '91. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer also says he has something to prove, having been fired by two of the 
NFL's most eccentric owners: Bill Sullivan of the New England Patriots, who has 
sold the franchise, and the bumbling Bob Irsay of the Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God I never worked for Bill Bidwill," Meyer said of the Arizona 
Cardinal owner, not noted as an NFL visionary. "That would have made it a 
trifecta. It was never my idea to leave the sidelines. I love coaching, I love 
the game. I think I'm good at it. . . . A little bit of this is 'I told you 
so.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After his 1991 ouster, Meyer went into private business and worked as an NFL 
analyst for CNN. 
</P>
<P>
 Working for Mileti took some adjusting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never see him," Meyer said, smiling. "He stays out of day-to-day 
operations. I love that." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of his deal, Meyer had to fill his staff with coaches who had previous 
CFL experience who could help Meyer through the game's nuances. The CFL plays 
with 12 men instead of 11, and on a wider and longer field. 
</P>
<P>
 While there has been some old-line resentment to American expansion in the 
CFL, Meyer believes U.S. teams will ultimately save the league. Thirty cities 
have submitted bids for four available CFL U.S. franchises next season. 
</P>
<P>
 The future of the CFL, most experts agree, is south of the Canadian border. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer contends the high-scoring Canadian game will eventually offer an 
alternative to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can be a godsend, if we don't Americanize the game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I miscalculated," Mileti said as he rooted his team on from the 55-yard-line 
bleacher seats high above the field. It was late in the third quarter of a game 
between minutes-old CFL rivals Las Vegas and Baltimore. "I thought we'd sell 
out the first game. I was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The Baltimore game drew only 10,122. 
</P>
<P>
 "I underestimated the heat's impact, psychologically," Mileti said. 
</P>
<P>
 The temperature at game time was 112. Mileti said it is difficult convincing 
fans that, once the sun sets, the weather is tolerable. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was baseball or volleyball or tennis, you'd say, 'Well, it's hot,' " 
Mileti said. "But football is Notre Dame and Michigan and crisp fall winds. 
Football and 112 degrees do not wash." 
</P>
<P>
 Fans who come are devout. Mileti spends much of the game in the stands, 
getting to know them. He has been known to hand deliver birthday requests to be 
announced over the public address system. 
</P>
<P>
 Mileti, 63, has long been associated with longshots. The Ohio-born businessman 
ignored the naysayers in the 1970s and built the Richfield Coliseum outside 
Cleveland. Mileti is a former owner of the Cleveland Barons of the American 
Hockey League, the Crusaders of the World Hockey Assn. and, for 10 years, the 
NBA's Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mileti was retired and living in Rome when he got the bug to acquire a CFL 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 He knew Las Vegas was the place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually, we will sell out and be the hottest ticket in town," Mileti said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mileti puts his faith in the town's expanding population and the eventual 
credibility of his product. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have excitement in a bottle," he said. "We have Sinatra here." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the NFL, which has tried to fight gamblers off with a stick, Mileti 
welcomes the action. Local bookmakers report betting on the CFL has increased 
significantly since the Posse joined the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big, big, big factor," Mileti said. "You can bet $2 and then come 
watch the game. I'm too old to be a hypocrite." 
</P>
<P>
 Mileti says it is folly the NFL denies its obvious multi-billion-dollar 
association to gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's embarrassing," he said. "It's legal. Damn right I'm being honest about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mileti has one other trump card. The CFL desperately needs him. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to make or break it," said Doug McConanchie, who covers 
Saskatchewan for the Saskatoon Star-Phoenix. "Why do you think they let Vegas 
in with a field 10 yards shorter and two yards narrower? Can you imagine the 
NFL doing that? Horses racing up and down the field, those are minor faux pas. 
"

LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES; 'QUAKE KIDS' FACE MEDIA AVALANCHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bleary-eyed from a day of travel and a 7 a.m. wake-up call Sunday, Northridge 
Little League players braced themselves for about 6.8 zillion questions about 
the Jan. 17 earthquake that will forever be associated with their city. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 members of the media have been credentialed to cover the 
eight-team Little World Series, which begins today. Northridge (17-0), 
representing the Western Region, will face Brooklyn Center, Minn., the Central 
Region champion, at 4 p.m. (PDT). 
</P>
<P>
 With about two reporters for every player, interesting angles are in demand. 
Brooklyn Center, for example, has a girl, Krissy Wendell, playing catcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge has an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many parents wear T-shirts declaring the team, "The Earthquake Kids," 
they are reluctant to recount the hardships they endured -- and continue to 
endure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to make a big to-do about it because so many people suffered," 
said Pat Cunningham, mother of catcher Matt Cunningham. "Baseball sign-ups were 
two weeks after the earthquake, and I guess that provided therapy for the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids were able to focus on something they love, and that was good. They 
don't seem troubled in any way." 
</P>
<P>
 Putting the pieces back together after the temblor brought some families 
closer together. Right fielder Spencer Gordon has seen a lot more of his mother 
and father, attorneys who practice together. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric and Bonnie Gordon's Warner Center office has yet to be reopened, so they 
practice out of their Northridge home. A home that remains severely damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom drove me back and forth to practice this year," Spencer Gordon said. 
"They both saw more games than usual, and everybody's home for dinner." 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball provided a more immediate saving grace for others. Four Northridge 
players weren't home during the earthquake because they were playing in an 
Amateur Athletic Union baseball tournament in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were staying in the San Bernardino Hilton when it hit, and we didn't think 
much of it until we turned on the TV and saw the fires," said Jack Fisher, 
father of shortstop Matt Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to my house and it was like the 'Poseidon Adventure,' " he said. "All 
the windows were blown out and the downstairs was destroyed. I only stayed 10 
minutes, that's all I could handle." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in Williamsport, they are still having to deal with nature. Rain on 
Sunday morning rendered the practice fields unplayable until late afternoon. 
Opening ceremonies Sunday night were moved from Howard J. Lamade Field indoors 
to the nearby Williamsport Community Arts Center because of the wet grounds.

MEETING ON GROUND RULES SET BEFORE TALKS RESUME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Fehr, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Assn., will 
meet today with Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief negotiator, to establish 
ground rules for the resumption of collective bargaining on Wednesday, when 
Ravitch will be joined by five owners and club officials selected by acting 
commissioner Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
 "I assume this means we'll be arguing about the shape of the table," Fehr said 
of today's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal mediators will join the two sides on Tuesday, with Wednesday's 
negotiating session being the first since the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr was not optimistic about the resumption of talks, having seen no 
evidence, he said, that the owners intend to change their position regarding a 
salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "They set out to have a strike, and they'll negotiate to end it when they want 
to end it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig, meanwhile, is expected to reveal a pool of 10 to 12 owners today, from 
which five will attend the negotiating sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although sources indicate otherwise, Selig denied Sunday that he has been 
under pressure from owners to change his initial list, but he said it has 
undergone "a fair amount of tinkering" over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial list included Selig's daughter, Wendy Selig-Prieb, the Milwaukee 
Brewers' vice president-general counsel; Chicago White Sox owner Jerry 
Reinsdorf; Philadelphia Phillie executive vice president David Montgomery; 
Minnesota Twin general manager Andy MacPhail; Toronto Blue Jay president Paul 
Beeston; Houston Astro owner Drayton McLane; Colorado Rockie owner Jerry 
McMorris; Seattle Mariner CEO John Ellis; Atlanta Brave president Stan Kasten, 
and Boston Red Sox owner John Harrington.

INJURED IRVAN STILL CRITICAL, REMAINS ON LIFE SUPPORT; AUTO RACING: SURGEON 
SAYS VITAL SIGNS ARE STABLE BUT CAN'T PREDICT A RETURN OF SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS.

 Race driver Ernie Irvan remained on life support and in critical condition 
Sunday, a day after a crash at Michigan International Speedway left him with 
severe head and chest injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "His vital signs over the past 24 hours have been stable and his blood 
pressure, pulse and vital functions remain on life support, which includes a 
ventilator for his breathing," said Dr. Errol Erlandson, trauma surgeon on the 
medical team treating Irvan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The area of the injury to his lungs remains severe but improved. His 
oxygenation has improved," Erlandson said via telephone hookup from St. Joseph 
Mercy Hospital at Ypsilanti. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see some increase in improvement on his chest X-ray examination, certainly 
no worsening. Specifically, there were no areas of hemorrhage of the brain. 
There was no sign of increasing pressure in the brain. And we see no areas of 
the brain that have suffered irreversible injury. However, I would point out 
that the injury is still severe." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if there is a specific period of time critical for the 35-year-old 
Irvan's chances of recovery, Erlandson said, "I wish I could give you a time 
frame for improvement, but when we're dealing with severe neurologic injury, 
certainly stabilization is very, very important. But, in terms of return of 
specific functions, it would be fruitless for me to predict." 
</P>
<P>
 The driver has remained unconscious since the crash.

WORLD SPORTS SCENE / RANDY HARVEY; TOP SECRET: NEXT U.S. REPRESENTATIVE ON IOC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 LeRoy Walker's best-kept secret, perhaps the only secret the amiable and 
usually forthcoming U.S. Olympic Committee president has chosen to conceal from 
the media, has been revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 On behalf of the USOC, the four men he recommended to fill the 2 1/2-year-old 
vacancy on the International Olympic Committee reserved for a second U.S. 
member are former United Nations ambassador Andrew Young, outgoing USOC 
executive director Harvey Schiller, USOC vice president Michael Lenard and 
international swimming federation vice president Ross Wales. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 24 hours after Walker confirmed that those were the names he 
presented to IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch during a meeting in Los 
Angeles on the day of the World Cup soccer final, the list was expanded to 
include three international sports federation presidents: Jim Easton of 
archery, George Killion of basketball and Don Porter of softball. 
</P>
<P>
 Anita DeFrantz, president of Los Angeles' Amateur Athletic Foundation, said 
last week that she and Samaranch have agreed upon the person who will join her 
as the IOC's other representative to the United States and that the name will 
be formally announced on Sept. 5 at the conclusion of an IOC session in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for inquiring minds, neither she nor Samaranch -- the only ones 
certain to know the name -- are willing to reveal it. But DeFrantz did say the 
nominee was not necessarily among the USOC recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 So why was Samaranch so insistent that the USOC be active in the process? 
</P>
<P>
 Those familiar with his thinking say he is sincere when he regularly 
pronounces the USOC the world's most important national Olympic committee and 
he did not want to ignore its interests. For example, when the USOC reacted 
negatively after he floated the name of his favorite candidate, Peter 
Ueberroth, Samaranch looked elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, he was repelled by the USOC's inability to arrive 
upon a consensus choice after Robert Helmick resigned from the IOC in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Samaranch trusted DeFrantz more than others among the USOC 
leadership. That does not mean that she was allowed to make the choice, but the 
new member will have her approval. 
</P>

 The USOC's male athlete of the year might have emerged last week in cycling's 
World Championships at Palermo, Italy. After becoming the first U.S. man to win 
a world championship in the match sprint since 1912 on Wednesday, Marty 
Nothstein became the first American to win two world titles in the same year by 
adding a gold medal Saturday in the keiren. 
</P>
<P>
 Intrigued while watching the cycling competition on television from his home 
in Pennsylvania during the 1984 Summer Olympics, Nothstein, 23, felt it was 
more of a calling than a coincidence when a small velodrome was constructed 
three years later next to his grandmother's Lehigh County home. 
</P>
<P>
 With three other medals on the track, the United States had already achieved 
its most successful world championships before the road competitions began 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The other theme from the first week at Palermo related to the fall of the 
Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their second place in the medal standings behind France, the Germans 
competing as one team were far less formidable than were the East Germans when 
they competed alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the reunification of the two Germanys, all the structures of the former 
East Germany were abandoned for purely economic reasons," German sprinter 
Michael Huebner said.

 The International Amateur Athletic Federation, which governs track and field, 
will investigate the fight between sprinters Dennis Mitchell of the United 
States and Olapade Adeniken of Nigeria that occurred in the lobby of a Zurich, 
Switzerland, hotel early Thursday. But the IAAF's director of competitions, 
Sandro Giovanelli, said the federation probably will not act because the fight 
appears to have been instigated by a personal matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell and Adeniken had to be separated the previous weekend at the 
Raleigh-Durham, N.C., airport after the Nigerian allegedly harassed Mitchell's 
mother and girlfriend at the check-in counter. Adeniken denies that, but an 
unconvinced Mitchell, in the company of his brother and masseur, reportedly 
confronted him again in Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Adeniken, a martial arts expert, more than held his own against the 
three men, he returned to his home in Austin, Tex., later that day with two 
stitches over his eye and a mild concussion. Mitchell's face was bloodied, but 
he was unbowed, finishing second in the 100 meters less than 48 hours later in 
Brussels, Belgium, and winning Sunday in Cologne, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said he had been advised by the IAAF, the governing body of track and 
field, and his association not to discuss the fight, but added that he would 
release a statement in the future. 
</P>

 The IOC hopes for a more peaceful resolution to the differences between its 
two Australian members, Kevan Gosper of Melbourne and Phil Coles of Sydney. 
Coles reportedly worked behind the scenes against Melbourne in its bid for the 
1996 Summer Olympics so that Sydney would be a viable candidate for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Coles says he has been falsely accused. But he remains suspect in Melbourne, 
which lost its campaign to Atlanta. Sydney won for 2000.

 Free-agent cornerback Deion Sanders is scheduled to be in Kansas City tonight 
to watch the Chiefs, who are interested in signing him, play the Chicago Bears. 
Next he is supposed to talk with the Atlanta Falcons, who already had a 
$2.88-million, $169,400-a-game offer rejected.Then it's on to New Orleans on 
Thursday. "It's early right now on the Deion world tour, and we're just one of 
the stops," said Jim Miller, the Saints' executive vice president of 
administration. "But if he wants to play here, we'll find the money somewhere." 
. . . Miami Dolphin linebacker Dwight Hollier will be sidelined for at least 
two weeks after injuring his left knee in Saturday night's 29-14 exhibition 
loss to Tampa Bay. . . . Pieces of a construction crane that collapsed in the 
Kingdome last week, killing two workers, were lowered and laid out on the 
stadium floor Sunday by investigators searching for the cause of the accident. 
Officials had hoped to reopen the stadium in time for the Seahawks' 
regular-season home opener Sept. 18.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; GILBERT, ROBINSON JOIN INJURED LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams, already without defensive end Fred Stokes for at least another week 
because of a knee injury, lost defensive tackle Sean Gilbert (injured knee, 
ankle) and defensive end Gerald Robinson (ankle) in the first half of a 29-20 
loss to the Raiders on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Coach Chuck Knox was most concerned about the condition of Gilbert, 
who will probably sit out Thursday's game against the San Diego Chargers.Knox 
said the ankle injury was Gilbert's most serious.  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know how long Sean will be out," Knox said. "Sometimes it takes as 
long as 10 days." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said Gilbert would not undergo an MRI exam on the knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson will also sit out practice today and is doubtful for the Charger 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the standing defensive linemen were in bad shape. Defensive tackle Jimmie 
Jones has a sprained wrist and might be held out of the Charger game, Knox 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect to go in there with (Marc) Boutte and (David Rocker) and see what 
they can do," Knox said. "We've had some injuries and we're getting them at one 
position." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the injuries mounting, Knox said the Rams might make a move this week. 
The team had former Washington Redskin Charles Mann in for a workout Wednesday 
and former Seattle Seahawk Jeff Bryant followed on Thursday. Knox said, of the 
two, the team would lean more toward signing Mann, who is a defensive end. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann has had nine knee operations, two in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff Bryant could play (defensive end) but he's a better inside player," Knox 
said. "We have not made a decision yet. (Today) might be a little too soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Teams cut their rosters to 60 on Tuesday, meaning more defensive ends will be 
available. CHRIS FOSTER

SOCCER / JULIE CART; FOCUS ON ROTHENBERG AFTER UGLY REELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The recent U.S. Soccer Federation elections did little to support the claim 
advanced by soccer insiders that the sport's national governing body has 
finally risen above petty politics and factional infighting. Quite the 
contrary: The politics of deal-making and manipulation only rose to a more 
sophisticated level. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer America magazine devoted an unprecedented amount of space to the 
election, calling it soccer's "quadrennial weekend of bloodletting." It turned 
out to be an apt description of the activities at a resort hotel in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue at hand: Would the delegates reelect Alan Rothenberg to another 
four-year term, thus affirming his stewardship of both the federation and the 
World Cup, or would they choose USSF treasurer Richard Groff and steer clear of 
Rothenberg's apparent conflict of interest as president of the USSF and head of 
the proposed new professional league? 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates bludgeoned voters with literature filled with personal attacks 
and charges of impropriety, utilizing the now-standard technique of leaving 
reams of position papers on hotel tables and in hallways. Much was made of each 
man's refusal to shake the other's hand. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all silly except that it was so important to the future of the game in 
this country and the question of whether soccer's leaders will be able to 
capitalize on whatever exposure and momentum remains from last month's World 
Cup. Things got out of hand when FIFA President Joao Havelange showed up to 
throw his considerable weight behind Rothenberg. It was difficult to determine 
if, for example, the director of youth soccer in central Oklahoma was impressed 
or offended by the blatant electioneering and FIFA's bald attempt to influence 
the election of a member federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg said FIFA asked to attend and his camp debated whether Havelange's 
heavy hand would be an asset or liability. As it had been in 1990, FIFA's 
interference in the USSF election was wrong. As messed up as the USSF is, it at 
least has a right to self determination. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg's campaign rhetoric took an interesting turn during the weekend, 
and the focus was Major League Soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of conflict of interest between his potential positions as head of 
the USSF and MLS was often raised and Rothenberg always noted that while MLS 
needed the support of the federation, the two entities were separate and 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, many times during his last-minute campaigning in San Diego, Rothenberg 
suggested that if not reelected, MLS would fail. Suddenly the connection 
between the USSF and the pro league was wholly necessary for the future of 
professional soccer in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 After that thinly veiled threat was tossed into play, delegates who might not 
have otherwise been disposed to vote for Rothenberg had to set aside their 
dislike for the candidate and give primacy to the need to support the proposed 
pro league. Faced with that kind of choice, they cast their votes for MLS, not 
Rothenberg. Hardly a ringing endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 There is another problem with the MLS-election connection: When the USSF 
awarded Rothenberg's group the right to organize a first-division outdoor 
league, it presumably did so in good faith, with an expectation that the group 
would make every effort to make MLS a viable league. The USSF turned down other 
earnest bidders and entrusted the pro league to Rothenberg's group. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt the other bidding groups would be dismayed to hear Rothenberg's 
attitude toward that trust. It seems that the MLS group's first obligation is 
to go about finding investors and getting the league off the ground, thus 
confirming U.S. Soccer's trust and World Cup's $5-million "loan." MLS has no 
business getting involved in USSF politics. Many in San Diego viewed the 
connection inappropriate, at best. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Conflict and alienation are not minor concerns for the USSF. It is important 
for Rothenberg to act to heal the wounds from the last four years and whatever 
injury caused by the recent campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Rothenberg needs to be more sensitive to conflict-of-interest concerns 
and to hold himself to a high standard of conduct whenever the USSF considers 
MLS matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the membership of the USSF made the right choice. Rothenberg 
argued that, for his organization of the World Cup alone, he should have been 
reelected. He's right. World Cup's organizational know-how left a legacy of 
international respect that should accrue to the U.S. federation. Rothenberg and 
his staff are responsible for that. 
</P>
<P>
 But without the goal of the World Cup, can Rothenberg maintain interest in the 
mundane chores of running soccer in the United States? Will he have time to 
devote to anything other than getting his league running? Can he work fairly 
with the other pro leagues? What will he do for player development, the issue 
that most soccer insiders believe is the most pressing.

LATE-BLOOMING SURFER FINDS NEW LIFE ON OCEAN; LONGBOARDING: WANDA LANGE 
DISCOVERED WAVES, AND WITH THEM, A NEW CLOSENESS WITH HER FAMILY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She drank quite a bit, dabbled in recreational drugs, and when it came to 
health and fitness, Wanda Lange was as lost as a piece of driftwood at sea. 
Then she discovered surfing 10 years ago, and she has been riding a new wave of 
energy since. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like I totally woke up," said Lange, a 38-year-old mother of four. "I 
have an addictive personality, but getting in the water and surfing 
re-channeled my addictive behavior. I can get an adrenaline rush in the water 
getting a big or long wave. I can get a rush naturally from the beauty out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Lange seems to draw her strength from the waves, and looking at her hectic 
schedule, she would seem to need a few 14-footers to start each day. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to raising her three sons and a stepson, ages 9 to 18, Lange works 
four nights a week as a waitress at a Los Alamitos restaurant, takes afternoon 
classes at Long Beach City College and competes in Professional Longboard Assn. 
events up and down the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
 She's also active in the Surfrider Foundation, a San Clemente-based 
environmental group, and somehow finds time to serve as team mom to her sons' 
youth soccer, baseball and basketball teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm overwhelmed all the time with kids, family, working and going to school," 
said the effervescent Lange, a 1974 graduate of Kennedy High School in La 
Palma. "But surfing in the morning relieves all that stress. I'm 38, but I feel 
like I'm 25. In fact, these are the better years of my life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was into drugs and things like that when I was younger -- I grew up in an 
age when everyone was doing that. But now I'm really healthy and into my family 
and husband. I used to get teased because I was so skinny, but paddling a 
surfboard has built up my shoulders. I look better now than I've ever looked in 
my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Lange's husband, Gray, and oldest son, Marcus, 18, can attest to that. The 
family's surfing vessel, a beat-up, green 1977 Dodge Van with the "Surf Costa 
Rica" logo, is well-known along the Pacific Coast Highway between Long Beach 
and San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone honks because they know us," Wanda said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, and when they pull up and see me, they're disappointed," said Gray, 49, 
a Long Beach middle school teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Lange has also heard her share of pick-up lines from teen-agers in the surf. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day, my oldest boy came in the house laughing his head off," Lange said. 
"He said his friend thought I was his sister and wanted to ask me out." 
</P>
<P>
 Such flattery might have never come Wanda's way had it not been for an odd 
exchange between Gray and a landscaping client 10 summers ago. Gray, who has a 
summer tree-trimming business, traded some yardwork for an old longboard so he 
could get back into surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 Wanda took that as a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was either sit on the beach with the kids or go out and learn how to 
surf," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 So Wanda bought a longboard. She brought it to Seal Beach, where the male 
surfers seemed happy to give her tips and let her drop in on waves, and soon 
she became quite proficient. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried a short board once, but when you're learning to surf, it's easier on 
a longboard, because they're easier to balance and stand up on," Lange said. 
"Paddling is so much harder on a short board. I didn't want to fight for waves. 
On a long board you just take a couple strokes, get up and you're on." 
</P>
<P>
 Noticing she was usually the only woman catching waves, Lange began entering 
Women's International Surfing Assn. events seven years ago so she could compete 
with more women. She had several first-place finishes in the novice division 
and usually placed among the top six after moving up to the women's longboard 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 When WISA disbanded four years ago, Lange began surfing in the PLA, which 
holds monthly club contests. Lange now surfs for the Newport Beach-based 
Blackie's Longboard Crew and has been sponsored by Wind And Sea Surfboards of 
Huntington Beach for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLA doesn't rank women's longboarders, but Lange reaches the semifinals 
(top eight) of most events and has won her share of prizes such as bathing 
suits and wet suits. 
</P>
<P>
 More important than the competition has been the impact surfing has had on 
Lange's family. Surfing events are turned into family vacations, with the 
Langes loading the kids in their RV and heading for surf spots such as 
Oceanside or Malibu. And the Langes surf together almost every morning during 
the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of families go to church together; this is our tradition," Lange said. 
"The kids learn a lot of new things, and it gives us something to talk about. I 
think they're really proud to have a mother out there who can rip and surf." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the most conventional lifestyle, but Lange says it's working. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeing the way kids are raised now and all the gangs, I mean, where are the 
parents?" Lange said. "The more you're involved with the kids, the more you do 
with them, the more open they are. 
</P>
<P>
 "My 18-year-old still tells me what he does every day. I'm not only their 
mother, I'm their friend. If you're with them, active with them, they don't 
have to tell all their stories to their friends, they can tell me. I want an 
open, active communication with them, and this is the way to do it."

Q & A: ASSESSING THE HOME-BUYING MARKET; HEAD OF REALTORS GROUP WARNS THAT 
ANOTHER INTEREST RATE INCREASE COULD STALL ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve's move last Tuesday to raise short-term interest rates 
sparked some alarm among potential California home buyers. Uncertain whether to 
buy now before interest rates rise further or to wait for rates to drop, more 
home shoppers may just decide to do nothing. Given the severity of the real 
estate downturn in recent years, the housing market in California is especially 
vulnerable should rising rates depress home sales.  
</P>
<P>
 But Pat Neal suggests the Fed rate hike will not significantly deter home 
sales. Neal, a Garden Grove realtor for 22 years, is president of the 
California Assn. of Realtors, which represents 104,000 members in the nation's 
largest housing market.  
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with Times staff writer Debora Vrana, Neal noted that several 
major lenders cut rates on fixed-rate mortgages last week while raising the 
rates on adjustable loans, a move that could prompt a comeback in fixed-rate 
mortgages, which have recently lost ground to adjustable rate mortgages with 
their lower initial rates. Fixed mortgage rates slipped last Wednesday to 8.75% 
from an average of 8.79% the week before, while adjustable loans climbed to 
5.81% from 5.76% the previous week. However, Neal predicted that any further 
spike in rates this year could mean trouble for the real estate industry and 
California's fragile economic recovery.  
</P>
<P>
 Question: The hike in interest rates last week has alarmed many potential home 
buyers, possibly causing some to shelve purchase plans, at least temporarily. 
What impact will this have on home sales in California? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The first time they increased interest rates in February, it had a 
dramatic impact on the market. People who were sitting on the fence trying to 
decide whether to buy or not took the plunge and bought. Since then, every time 
they've done it, we haven't seen that type of an impact. 
</P>
<P>
 So, I don't think we're going to see a dramatic impact on sales from interest 
rates. I think it's just the time of the year when sales get a little sluggish. 
People are getting their children ready to go back to school.  
</P>
<P>
 Everything is changing. It's the dog days of August. So, while the momentum 
may drop now, I don't think it is as a result of the interest rates, because 
historically we still have good rates. I think what we will see is that 
fixed-rate mortgages will stay pretty steady, they may even go down. But 
adjustable rates will go up. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What will be the impact on the state and Orange County if rates rise again 
this year? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It will slow the recovery. We have been seeing a recovery in housing at 
least since the last quarter of 1993 and we've seen housing leading California 
out of a recession. In part, because there are so many things you have to buy 
when you buy a house -- appliances, drapery, carpet, furniture, flowers, 
plants.  
</P>
<P>
 And 51% of our home sales in this state have been to first-time home buyers, 
and they tend to need more things. And that helped the recovery in California. 
Another rise in rates will impact Orange County very much. We were not ready in 
Orange County for the type of recession that we've been in. We just really did 
not think it would happen to us. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What advice would you give to a potential home buyer right now? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think I'd buy something now, while prices are still good. We've seen the 
prices firming and I think we've seen the bottom in prices. So I would say if 
they were going to buy, they had better hurry. The lenders are very anxious, 
because they don't have the refinancing market they did (last year). So, it is 
to the benefit of someone who is considering buying to seriously look at this 
market now.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: You have been a realtor in Orange County for more than two decades. How 
have you seen the local housing market change and where do you see it going? 
</P>
<P>
 A: One of the things I see happening that is positive is that we are much more 
affordable now. Something that worried many of us in the industry was when we 
became so unaffordable, with only 11% of the population at one point able to 
afford a home here. We were locking out our own children who might want to live 
in Orange County. We were locking out young families with children. Now that 
things are more affordable, we are seeing these young people come back into the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are home buyers telling your members these days? 
</P>
<P>
 A: They are concerned about the overall stability of the California economy. 
They are looking at houses as shelter and a long-term investment rather than as 
a speculative investment, as people were in the late 1980s. Back then, buyers 
would ask us if they could sell a home in a year for a big profit and get 
something else. And we're not hearing any of that now, which is healthy.  
</P>
<P>
 Today's buyers are concerned about schools, whether the neighborhood is safe. 
They are more concerned about quality of life rather than the size of the 
house. They want convenience and comfort. The house is a haven now. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you think of the rising popularity of so-called high-density 
detached housing, where as many as seven or more single-family homes sit on a 
single acre of land?  
</P>
<P>
 A: What we found out years ago is that first-time buyers want a house like mom 
and dad had, a "Leave It to Beaver" house, but if they could not afford that, 
they would take a condominium and as soon as they could get into a house, they 
would. So now we're finding, because in many instances both members of a couple 
work, they want the house, but they don't want to do the yard work. So a house 
without common walls that doesn't have a big yard does appeal to young 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why is your trade group backing legislation to change the way home 
inspections are handled in California?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We found, over the last several years, due to the tremendous liability that 
is attached to selling a home, that it is in the best interest of the consumer 
and the realtor to have an inspection. Realtors are not trained to do that, 
they can only point out what they can see, such as a spot on a ceiling. So home 
inspections from our point of view are good for the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
 The drawback has been that home inspecting companies have not wanted to accept 
any liability or responsibility for what they have pointed out (or fail to 
detect). And from our point of view that didn't make a lot of sense, because 
buyers rely on their information. Our proposed legislation, (AB 2780) calls for 
them to take responsibility for what they have inspected -- they're the 
experts.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: FIGURING THE FUTURE OF TECH STOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a symbol of investors' rejuvenated interest in technology stocks, not much 
beats the hot streak of IBM Corp. shares in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-ailing computer giant's stock surged $1.875 on Friday to a 20-month 
high of $68.125, helped by upbeat comments from two well-known Wall Street 
analysts. Measured since the end of June, IBM's share price is now up 16%. 
</P>
<P>
 Many IBM buyers are focusing specifically on the prospect of faster computer 
sales growth overseas, as the economies of Europe and Japan pick up speed. The 
summer rebound in tech shares generally, however, seems driven more by a 
realization that the vicious spring selloff in these stocks was overdone. 
</P>
<P>
 In dumping tech issues during May and June, investors were responding to fears 
that sales and earnings would be victimized by a slower U.S. economy (courtesy 
of the Federal Reserve Board). But in July, many or most tech companies' 
second-quarter earnings reports put those fears to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week, electronics leader Hewlett-Packard and software producer 
Autodesk both reported results for their quarters ended July 31, and the 
numbers were so surprisingly strong that Hewlett's stock immediately leaped 11% 
and Autodesk's rocketed 17%. 
</P>
<P>
 The resurgence of tech shares overall this summer has already been powerful 
enough to lift a key tech-stock index back into positive territory for the 
year-to-date. The 200-stock tech index compiled by San Francisco brokerage 
Hambrecht & Quist, which dove 13% between the end of February and the end of 
June, now is up 3.6% for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the Standard & Poor's 500 index of blue chip stocks is down 0.6% 
year-to-date. 
</P>
<P>
 Beating the S&P so far this year is a continuation of an important trend for 
tech investors: Despite hair-raising volatility in the stocks, the H&Q index 
has posted bigger price gains than the S&P every year since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 That contrasts vividly with the 1986-89 period, when the H&Q badly lagged the 
S&P in three of four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet tech stock bulls complain that Wall Street still treats the computer 
business as if the plug could be pulled at any minute, without appreciating how 
large, how global and diverse an industry it has become. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it's certainly true that the tremendous speed of technology product 
cycles means there is high risk in owning any single tech stock, the greater 
risk may be in failing to own a piece of a diversified tech portfolio in the 
'90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Efficiency, after all, is what the world economy rewards most highly today, 
and efficiency is what technology promises. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, three tech-stock veterans explain their optimism about the industry and 
where they see the greatest potential for investors: 
</P>
<P>
 * Michael Murphy, editor, California Technology Stock Letter, Half Moon Bay, 
Calif. A bear on the stock market overall, Murphy is bullish on the tech sector 
for a simple reason, he says: "Valuations on technology-driven companies are no 
higher than 'other' companies, even though (tech companies') real growth rates 
are three or more times as high." That disparity "can't last," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy believes Wall Street is just beginning to realize the true value of 
tech companies' franchises. Why now? In large part, he says, it's because so 
many investors now are part of the tech revolution via personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology, Murphy says, "has been demystified" by its spread. So the old 
argument against investing in tech stocks -- "Don't buy what you don't 
understand" -- is no longer valid, he says. "People have not only lost their 
fear of the unknown in technology, they are actively embracing it." 
</P>
<P>
 More important, the global growth potential in computers and related 
equipment, telecommunications, biotechnology and other tech sectors remains 
spectacular, Murphy says. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, whereas there are 150 million personal computers in the world, he 
estimates that there are 250 million people who have the skills and income to 
buy a computer today but haven't yet done so. 
</P>
<P>
 The semiconductor industry alone, Murphy says, will invest $100 billion in new 
plants and equipment over the next five years to meet the world's burgeoning 
demand for computer chips -- now standard equipment even in the lowliest 
household appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Intel Corp. -- the premier name in chips -- is a mere $63 stock. At that 
price, Murphy notes, it sells for just 11 times this year's estimated earnings 
per share. The S&P 500 index, in contrast, is priced at 15 times estimated 1994 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The point, Murphy says, is that tech stock prices as a group don't come close 
to discounting the industry's future growth. That makes this a must-own 
business, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Intel, his "core" tech holdings include disk-drive giant Seagate 
Technology, work-station maker Sun Microsystems, and Vitesse Semiconductor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Roger McNamee, money manager, Integral Capital Partners, Menlo Park, Calif. 
Like Murphy, McNamee finds the still-depressed prices of many tech stocks quite 
at odds with the companies' outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 The average computer company, McNamee says, does about half its business 
overseas. With the dollar weak (thus lowering prices of U.S. goods abroad) and 
Europe and Japan in recovery mode, the stage seems set for healthy growth in 
the near term, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But McNamee is less sanguine than Murphy that the market will begin treating 
tech stocks with due respect anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The profile of the average tech investor is a manic-depressive," McNamee 
says. The industry is bigger and more complex than ever before, but few money 
managers have time to dig deep into the fundamentals, he says. So when the 
market perceives a problem in any part of the business, the typical manager's 
reaction is to bail. 
</P>
<P>
 McNamee figures that extreme volatility will remain a hallmark of tech stocks. 
The savvy investor must learn to use that to his or her advantage, buying the 
stocks when they periodically plunge, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But not just any tech issues. McNamee focuses on the major product cycles in 
the business -- the innovations that generate massive new sales and create 
their own momentum. "As an investor, that's where I want to be," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft Corp.'s expected 1995 rollout of "Chicago," the successor 
personal-computer software to the blockbuster Windows program, is perhaps the 
most exciting major product cycle on the horizon, McNamee says. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft itself is the obvious way to play that cycle, he says, but many 
other tech firms will also benefit as "Chicago" lures new computer buyers and 
encourages others to upgrade. McNamee likes Cirrus Logic, for example, as a 
chipmaker with strong franchises in computer graphics and multimedia. 
</P>
<P>
 Another major cycle underway, McNamee says, is the development of the 
infrastructure for wireless communications worldwide, and the shift in 
telecommunications from analog to digital. Motorola remains a key way to play 
this cycle, he says, along with Mobile Telecommunications Technologies, the 
leader in paging services. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, McNamee sees opportunity in the suppliers of equipment for 
interactive TV systems and other new wired communications networks. Alantec, a 
hot new designer of a telecom switching hubs, is one idea. 
</P>
<P>
 * Paul Wick, manager, Seligman Communications & Information stock mutual fund, 
New York. As well as tech stocks have performed over the last few years, Wick's 
fund has done even better: up 55% in 1991, 17% in '92, 36% in '93 and 10% so 
far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 He still is extremely enthusiastic about two tech sectors in particular: 
semiconductors and makers of machinery used by semiconductor producers. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise of computer networking alone, Wick says, is fueling a heavy demand 
for chips that isn't likely to be sated soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Among niche chip players, he likes Xilinx and Altera Corp., both of which make 
high-density programmable logic chips. The idea there, Wick says, is that 
computer makers and other end users of chips can buy blank, programmable chips 
from Xilinx and Altera instead of footing the bill for custom-designed chips. 
</P>
<P>
 Wick also sees great potential in three major producers of memory chips: 
Cypress Semiconductor, Alliance Semiconductor and Integrated Device Technology. 
As computers learn to do more and at ever-faster speeds, they naturally require 
more memory capacity, he notes. 
</P>
<P>
 As the chip makers themselves expand, meanwhile, manufacturers of equipment 
used in chip factories also are booming. Applied Materials is one of the 
best-known equipment makers, but Wick favors some lesser-known firms, including 
FSI International, which he says has picked up some large orders in recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 FSI is the kind of bargain Wick is most comfortable with: The firm should earn 
$1.35 a share next year, yet the stock's price is $15.50, or about 11 times 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, despite tech stocks' gains in the '90s, Wick says he still finds 
plenty of reasonably priced issues. 3Com Corp., for example, is a low-cost 
computer networker "that seems to be taking market share in all areas," he 
says. At 24 times 1994 operating earnings per share, the stock must look 
undervalued to 3Com management, because the firm has been buying back shares, 
Wick says. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Parametric Technology, a leader in software used in mechanical 
design (Ford Motor is a big customer) "is the most profitable public software 
company in the world," Wick says. 
</P>
<P>
 But thanks to the spring plunge in tech shares, the stock -- now at $27.875 -- 
is priced at just 19 times estimated 1995 earnings, he says. Tech Stocks: 
Winner for the '90s? 
</P>
<P>
 An index of 200 technology stocks tracked by brokerage Hambrecht & Quist was a 
poor performer for most of the late '80s. But since 1991, tech stocks' price 
appreciation has beaten that of the blue chip Standard & Poor's 500-stock index 
every year. Annual price changes: 
</P>
<P>
 H&Q tech index: 3.6% 
</P>
<P>
 S&P 500: -0.6% 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Hambrecht & Quist; Standard & Poor's How Tech Stocks Stack Up 
</P>
<P>
 Some money managers maintain that leading tech stocks are priced too cheaply 
relative to their growth potential. Here are some major stocks, their estimated 
or actual fiscal 1994 operating earnings per share (EPS), price-to-earnings 
(P-E) ratios and estimated annualized EPS growth rates over the next five 
years. 06,19,15,08,09,05,12 1994 Fri. Est. '94 5-yr. est. Company high-low

'J.LEAGUE' SPELLS SUCCESS; SOCCER FAST TO GAIN BUSINESS AND FAN APPEAL IN JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The suburban Tokyo stadium was packed with fans of the Urawa Red Diamonds 
professional soccer team. Some wore the hometown red. Others strung up a 
red-on-black banner marked with a white skull and crossbones and a message to 
the visiting Yokohama Marinos: "Welcome to RED HELL." 
</P>
<P>
 Each time the Red Diamonds attacked or scored a goal, the stadium erupted into 
a cheering, screaming frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Long an obscure sport here -- with an even lower profile than in the United 
States -- soccer has exploded on the national scene in an extraordinary wave of 
popularity, challenging the traditional national obsessions of sumo wrestling 
and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in the middle of its second season, the 12-team, Japan Professional 
Football League -- known as the "J.League" -- is also a remarkable financial 
success for many individual players and their teams' corporate sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 Games are sold out long in advance. And flamboyant foreign and domestic soccer 
stars -- having surpassed baseball stars -- are ubiquitous in television, print 
and billboard advertisements for everything from sausages to long-distance 
telephone services. 
</P>
<P>
 Products licensed to carry J.League emblems range from windbreakers and 
accessories to Kodak film that comes with attached glossy souvenir photos of 
soccer stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Annual sales of items for which the league draws royalty payments are running 
at $1.5 billion. The total J.League-related market is boosted another $600 
million by television broadcast fees, payments for the advertising in which 
players or logos appear, corporate sponsorships, food and beverages sold at 
games, ticket sales and other activities. All this is happening even though 
most of the league's stadiums can accommodate no more than 15,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The secret to the popularity of the J.League is merchandising," said Kazuki 
Sasaki, the J.League's public affairs manager. "We decided to copy the American 
model of sports business." 
</P>
<P>
 Promotion has been brilliant. But success came because the sport hit a 
responsive chord in younger Japanese attracted to its speed and freedom, which 
contrasts sharply with the stoic discipline of Japanese baseball and the 
quasi-religious rites of sumo wrestling. Soccer's emergence as a major national 
sport reflects the changing values of a generation that knows only affluence 
and wants something beyond hard work. The sport in turn seems capable of 
reinforcing new visions of how life should be lived. 
</P>
<P>
 The free spirit of Japanese soccer is symbolized by players like Kazuyoshi 
Miura of the Verdy Kawasaki team, a handsome star who after scoring displays 
his joy by performing what has become known as the "Kazu dance" -- a comical 
arm-waving, prancing routine that fans love. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball players are the more serious type," commented Takuya Jinno, a player 
for the Yokohama Marinos. "There are lots of interesting soccer players. I 
guess it's because there's more freedom in soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most wildly popular players is Alcindo Sartori, 26, a Brazilian 
superstar who displays a luxurious cascade of shoulder-length hair, surrounding 
a prominent bald spot on the top of his head. He is a flashy player who never 
hides his emotions, and Japanese fans affectionately have nicknamed him 
"Kappa," after bald-domed river spirits of Japanese mythology. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's top two wig makers realized almost simultaneously that a long-haired 
real-life kappa sports star could be an advertising treasure. Aderance Co. beat 
out its rival Art Nature in a bidding war for his services, snagging him with a 
reported $300,000 contract. The deal allowed him to doff the wig for games, 
maintaining his popular bald-pated image for sports fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball inherits long Japanese traditions like waend (harmony) or bushido 
(the samurai way)," said Yutaka Hosokawa, 30, a telephone company employee and 
soccer fan. "It's characterized by attitudes of 'Don't stick out. Don't talk. 
Get results.' Soccer doesn't have that, because it was born just last year . . 
. Alcindo is doing well in games. He's scoring goals. . . . So they don't tell 
him, 'Live modestly, don't be so flashy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Far from trying to crush individualism and force players into a mold, J.League 
management seems to exult in the creation of a new sports culture for Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 J.League chairman Saburo Kawabuchi, in a speech to the Foreign Correspondents 
Club, compared baseball to kabuki , a form of Japanese drama with pauses 
between scenes. Soccer, he noted, is more like rock-and-roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer players "can have long hair or pierced ears," Sasaki said. "Young 
people look up to them because they are looking for freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Sasaki added, however, that the audience last year "was more individualistic, 
like Americans." He lamented that some spectators at this year's games have 
started to follow informal cheerleaders:"When they lift their left hand, they 
follow. When they lift their right hand, they follow." He viewed this as a sign 
that deep-rooted traditions may corrode even the free spirit of soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japanese are brought up at school with a stress on unified behavior," he 
said. "It's the idea that 'If everyone crosses the street together, it's not 
dangerous.' " 
</P>
<P>
 This tendency toward conformity makes it difficult for anyone to judge with 
certainty whether the popularity of J.League soccer marks just another passing 
fad or the permanent entrenchment of a major new national sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term global ambitions are reflected in the league's use of the word 
"football" in its official English name, even though the sport in Japanese is 
referred to as sakka , derived from American usage. League and government 
officials have already proclaimed a desire to host the 2002 World Cup finals. 
The bid itself should help entrench soccer by encouraging construction of 
bigger stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
 J.League coaches and officials are watching now with a mixture of hope and 
trepidation for signs of how the recent World Cup championships in the United 
States will affect soccer's future here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most frightening thing is that everybody has been watching the world's 
top competition," said Hidehiko Shimizu, general manager of the Yokohama 
Marinos. "When they see fantastic games on television and compare it with 
J.League, they may feel there's a big difference. . . . But it's also the best 
chance for them to understand what soccer is really about. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to long-term popularity, Shimizu said, is to build up the skills of 
professional players so they will impress increasingly knowledgeable fans. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, things have unfolded exactly according to plan -- except even better 
than J.League founders had dared to hope. The mutually supportive interplay 
between product sales and the game itself, the emphasis on youthful freedom, 
the star quality of the players, the low-profile role of corporate owners, the 
stoking of local community pride -- all this was calculated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young people are the ones who create new trends, so we made people around 20 
our targets, especially young women," Sasaki said. "If we can get young women 
interested, and they want to come to the stadium, young men will come with them 
for sure. The products also target women, with fashionable items." 
</P>
<P>
 For an enterprise infused with business smarts, one of the bravest things 
J.League officials did was demand that the corporate ownership of teams be 
downplayed. Some firms resisted, but all eventually went along. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the J.League was created from the country's best amateur teams, which 
usually had company sponsorship, the league banned identification of the 
corporate owner in the newly professional teams' names. Instead, in a bid to 
arouse spectator enthusiasm, it required that they include the name of the 
local community. This had the added advantage of drawing local governments into 
the J.League teams through activities as upgrading stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Fumikazu Yamaguchi, vice president of Saitama Transport, an Urawa taxi firm, 
said his company is happy to help sponsor the Red Diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do it because they're the home team, it's good for our image, and we want 
to share in the good luck of a developing sport," he said. "It differentiates 
us from other taxi companies with the customers, and it encourages our drivers

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE; PARENT OF ADDICTION TREATMENT CENTERS FACES 
SERIOUS AILMENTS OF ITS OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Frawley Corp., which claims its Schick tobacco, alcohol and drug addiction 
treatment centers have restored thousands of patients to productive lives, is 
itself ailing. Its chance of recovery is dubious. 
</P>
<P>
 The Encino-based company has been forced into a tailspin, primarily by the 
push among health insurers to reduce costs. Exacerbating a five-year decline in 
revenue generated by its operating unit has been the collapse in Southern 
California real estate, which is among Frawley's principal holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 Frawley's losses since 1988 -- its last profitable year -- total $12.8 
million. At the end of last year, revenue had declined more than 72%. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in the opinion of its auditors, Deloitte & Touche of Los Angeles, there 
is "doubt about (Frawley's) ability to continue as a going concern," according 
to an April filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 About 70% of the company's stock (it was delisted by the Pacific Stock 
Exchange in 1982 after tumbling to six cents a share) is owned by Patrick J. 
Frawley Jr., its eccentric chief executive, and his family. His son Michael P. 
Frawley is vice president of the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Frawley says he will pull his company out of its hole by selling off 
real estate, jettisoning two of Schick's three addiction treatment hospitals, 
and putting smaller Schick units in acute care hospitals across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Frawley, 71, a millionaire who once chaired the Schick Safety Razor Co., may 
have the wherewithal to succeed, but the odds are long. As of March 31, the 
company owed $4 million in current liabilities -- due within 12 months -- and 
its current assets had shrunk to $2 million. For the quarter that ended March 
31, Frawley lost $689,000 on revenue of $1.82 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're trying as hard as they possibly can to turn things around," 
said Frank Hawrylak, an analyst with Tweedy, Browne Company, a New York 
investment firm that held about 7% of Frawley's stock before unloading it 
earlier this year. "Frawley believes he's got a good product," Hawrylak said. 
"I don't know if he does or not." 
</P>
<P>
 The company's core business has always been its Schick Laboratories unit, 
which has a handful of small addiction treatment centers and, until recently, 
large addiction treatment hospitals in Santa Barbara, Seattle and Ft. Worth, 
Tex. Schick treats addictions by administering small electric shocks or drugs 
that induce nausea while patients are confronted with the substances they are 
addicted to. Patrick Frawley says Schick has a 70% success rate in treating 
alcohol and tobacco addictions, and a 50% success rate treating addictions to 
cocaine and other drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Schick thrived in the 1980s before health insurers noted that mental health 
treatments were the fastest rising area of health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing clout of cost-conscious health maintenance organizations 
accelerated the trend toward a sharp reduction in mental health payments. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past decade, the money HMOs have budgeted for mental health coverage, 
including addiction treatment, has dwindled from $2 per patient per month to 
about 50 cents, said John Edelston, president of HealthPro Associates, a 
consulting firm in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the cost savings has been achieved by curtailing inpatient care in 
favor of cheaper outpatient treatment. Schick has bucked this trend; it still 
requires patients to check in for a 10-day stay, followed by a pair of two-day 
treatment sessions. Patrick Frawley insists that changing the Schick method 
would reduce its effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Schick's price of about $12,000 for treatment is more than twice 
the cost for typical outpatient treatments at other detox centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Schick's high prices have made it difficult for the company to land contracts 
with HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
 Having become increasingly dependent on patients who pay out of pocket for 
treatment, and facing more competition from nicotine patch treatments and other 
alternative products, Schick's business has shrunk. The company treated about 
2,000 addicts in 1988, and Patrick Frawley acknowledged the number "has gone 
down steadily" ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Frawley Corp. has managed to stay afloat largely by selling off Southern 
California real estate that it had purchased with 1980s profits from the Schick 
division. By 1989, the company owned 713 acres of largely undeveloped land in 
the Santa Monica Mountains near Agoura that it had acquired for about $12.9 
million, according to SEC documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past three years, Patrick Frawley said, the company sold 450 acres in 
the Santa Monica mountains and suffered a $3-million loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Frawley and his son Michael have also lent the company $416,000, according to 
SEC documents. 
</P>
<P>
 That Patrick Frawley has dipped into his own pockets reflects his obsessive 
commitment to the business. For the elder Frawley, a former alcoholic, curing 
the nation's addicts has become a personal crusade. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was treated for alcoholism in the early 1970s, Patrick Frawley had had 
a successful career operating businesses and investing in real estate since the 
1940s. Early in his career, he took over a failing ballpoint pen parts maker 
that became the Papermate Pen Co. and later chaired the Schick razor company. 
</P>
<P>
 Frawley launched Schick treatment centers in 1972 after he was impressed with 
the treatment for alcoholism that he received at the Shadel Hospital in 
Seattle. He eventually bought the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting addictions became his life's mission, and often he seems able to talk 
about little else. 
</P>
<P>
 During a series of lengthy telephone interviews, Frawley expounded on the 
personal and social costs of addictions. Asked to discuss the condition of his 
business, Frawley repeatedly resisted. "You're not interested in the guts of it 
-- saving people's lives," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sketching his plan to save the company, Frawley said the first step is to "get 
rid of the bricks and mortar." So the company shut down its 50-bed detox 
hospital in Ft. Worth in May, and Frawley said the building was expected to be 
sold this month for $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-bed Santa Barbara hospital was closed in June, and Frawley hopes to 
sell it for about $2.5 million, he said. The proceeds from the hospital sales 
will be used to pay off debts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospitals will be replaced by a network of smaller treatment centers 
within acute care hospitals across the country, Frawley said. One such unit, a 
13-bed facility at St. Mary Medical Center in Long Beach, opened in November. 
Four others could be in place by the end of the year, Frawley said, though he 
declined to give more details. 
</P>
<P>
 Frawley hopes the Schick unit can cut its costs by sharing administrative, 
clerical and maintenance costs with hospitals. And hospitals, Frawley said, 
will welcome the business because the trend to outpatient care has left many 
hospitals with empty beds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to lower costs as much as we can," Frawley said. "I think we're 
going to be successful eventually." 
</P>
<P>
 But with revenues on a steep five-year slide, the escape hatch for Frawley 
Corp. grows narrower by the minute. That is a problem even the chief executive 
acknowledges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously we can't do it much longer," Frawley said. "We've got to come up 
with some solutions."

FORMER FOX CHIEF MAY GET TOP JOB AT NEW NETWORK; TELEVISION: SALHANY'S CLASH 
WITH RUPERT MURDOCH HAS NOT HURT HER IMAGE AS AN EXECUTIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lucie Salhany, who resigned as chairman of the Fox Broadcasting Co. network 
last month, is in discussions on becoming the head of United Paramount Network 
-- Chris-Craft's and Paramount's joint venture to start a fifth TV network, 
industry sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Salhany, who left Fox after clashing with studio Chairman Rupert Murdoch, 
previously worked at Paramount, helping to develop hits such as "The Arsenio 
Hall Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Her appointment would likely calm fears that the United Paramount Network may 
be on shaky ground. Chris-Craft and Paramount recently renegotiated the terms 
of their joint venture and Paramount is experiencing delays with the production 
of "Star Trek: Voyager," the showcase series intended to anchor the fifth 
network. 
</P>
<P>
 Unforeseen glitches are part and parcel of the television business, but those 
at the United Paramount Network are magnified because the partners are in a 
high-stakes race with Warner Bros., which is launching its own fifth network. 
Both networks want to begin broadcasting two nights of programming early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Salhany's brief tenure at Fox was marred by the high-profile failure 
of "The Chevy Case Show," she nonetheless is highly regarded by local 
broadcasters, who consider her programming instincts, marketing skills and 
salesmanship to be among the best in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Paramount declined to comment. A head for the network is 
expected to be named shortly. If Salhany takes the job at Paramount, then both 
competing fifth networks will be run by former heads of the Fox network. Jamie 
Kellner, chief executive of Warner Bros.' WB Network, was a founder and 
president of Fox Broadcasting Co. As with Kellner, it is expected that Salhany 
would have a financial stake in the network. 
</P>
<P>
 Salhany, however, has also been having discussions with CBS on heading up the 
network's expansion into syndication, and talking with other suitors, people 
close to her said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Paramount, Salhany ran the most profitable syndication division of any 
major studio, producing and distributing hits such as "Entertainment Tonight," 
"Hard Copy" and "Star Trek: The Next Generation." She left the studio to join 
Fox in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowledgeable sources said that Salhany has been courted by Evan Thompson, 
head of Chris-Craft's TV operations, who has been taking a larger part in the 
venture. Kerry McCluggage, chairman of Paramount TV Group, has been overseeing 
the network for the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris-Craft, which through affiliates owns eight TV stations, including 
KCOP-TV (Channel 13) in Los Angeles, is one of the nation's biggest station 
groups. The broadcaster is seen by some as taking the lead in shaping the fifth 
network after Paramount's new owner, Viacom, balked at committing itself. 
Chris-Craft agreed to shoulder more of the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount, however, will still be the main program supplier to the network, 
and has pledged its newest Star Trek sequel, "Voyager," to the venture. The 
three previous Star Trek series as well as the six theatrical features have 
made hundreds of millions in profits for Paramount and are widely considered 
the studio's most valuable "franchise." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Voyager" sequel has been created by veteran "Star Trek" producers Rick 
Berman, Jeri Taylor and Michael Piller. In recent weeks, however, the show has 
suffered casting setbacks and missed two production start dates. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the leading role, originally written for a woman, may be changed to 
a male character. The producers could not come up with an actress who was 
satisfactory to both them and the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 An executive with the show said that six of the nine roles have been cast and 
that enough "padding" has been built into production schedule so that the show 
can still meet its January air date. "We have another week or two to go before 
we get into trouble," the executive said. "We want to find the right person and 
someone we can all agree with." 
</P>
<P>
 The producers are scheduled to see both actors and actresses read for the lead 
role this week.

 Housing Export Accord to Be Signed: An agreement that will be signed Tuesday 
in San Diego by Texas, U.S. and Japanese trade officials as well as home 
builders and suppliers, may speed up the export of finished houses to Japan. 
Because housing in Japan costs 50% more than comparable U.S. units, demand for 
imported houses is increasing.But non-tariff barriers have kept U.S. 
manufacturers out of the Japanese market. Japanese company A-Peras will sign 
agreements with 17 Texas-based home builders and suppliers, including Ryland 
Building Systems, to try to break the barriers with help from both governments. 
If all goes well, A-Peras will offer U.S.-made houses to Japanese consumers at 
28% to 44% below current prices, all with "favorable effects on Japan-U.S. 
relations," the company said.

 Navy Hearing Scheduled: The Navy will hold a public meeting Tuesday at the 
Naval Training Center in San Diego to discuss the environmental cleanup 
required at the center before it can be developed for civilian use. The 
service, which is leaving the 560-acre, prime harbor-side site, plans to turn 
it over to the city, whose mayor, Susan Golding, heads a planning committee 
trying to figure out the best -- and most lucrative -- uses for the 
property.The group is entertaining numerous development ideas from the private 
sector as well as requests from the U.S. Postal Service, the U.S. Immigration 
and Naturalization Service and one tribe of Native Americans for various uses. 
The Navy plans to leave the facility no later than 1999 but could leave as 
early as 1996, when recruit training is consolidated in the Great Lakes 
training center in Illinois.

 Glaxo Considering Lilly Stake: The British pharmaceuticals company Glaxo 
Holdings is considering buying a $1-billion stake in the Eli Lilly & Co. PCS 
Health Systems Inc. drug distribution unit, the Sunday Times of London 
reported.Indianapolis-based Lilly is the sixth-largest U.S. pharmaceutical 
company by sales, and it needs to cut the $2.5-billion debt it is taking on to 
pay for its $4.2-billion purchase of PCS from McKesson Corp. Peter Lang, a 
pharmaceutical analyst at Salomon Brothers, is quoted as saying a Glaxo stake 
in PCS is "a plausible outcome." Lilly shares have climbed more than 14% to 
$57.25 in the past two weeks amid speculation that Glaxo may be poised to make 
an unsolicited bid for the entire company, which analysts value at about $15 
billion.

 Frankwell to Reopen: The firm, whose trading operations in three states were 
shut down by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, plans to reopen within 
the next two weeks. U.S. District Judge Lowell Jensen earlier this week lifted 
a temporary restraining order issued in June and dissolved a receivership of 
Frankwell Bullion Ltd. assets. "This decision confirms our position that the 
raid on Frankwell and the shutdown of its trading activities were totally 
unjustified," said Gary Benton, the Hong Kong-based firm's attorney.Regional 
attorneys for the CFTC were not available for comment. Jensen froze Frankwell's 
assets when the CFTC accused the firm in a civil suit of illegally selling 
contracts that speculated on the future price of gold, silver and foreign 
currencies.

 Savoy, Forte Hotel Groups to Combine Management: Savoy Hotel and Forte, the 
British-based rivals that run some of the world's finest hotels, have agreed on 
a joint venture, London's Independent newspaper reported.It said that 
management of all the Savoy hotels -- including the Connaught and Claridges in 
London and the Lancaster in Paris -- and of some or all of Forte's luxury-class 
hotels will be combined. Three key trusts that hold about 40% of Savoy's voting 
rights reportedly forged the agreement with Forte, which is based on a plan 
offered by Morgan Stanley Bank. Since Forte's unsuccessful attempt to take 
control of Savoy in the late 1980s, Forte has held 42.1% of the voting rights.

 Whirlpool to Sell European-Style Washers in U.S.: The company said building 
the energy-efficient machines for the U.S. market in 1996 will beat new 
government standards by three years.It said it will spend at least $40 million 
initially to convert production for the new model, which tumbles clothes like a 
dryer and uses about one-third of the water and energy that a conventional 
washing machine requires. It did not announce the production site or volume. 
Environmental groups praised the announcement.

 Ninety minutes into what many predicted would be the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange's 
(TASE) "Black Sunday," the government backtracked. It modified the pending 
capital-gains tax so profits can be offset against losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that within several days we will stabilize at a reasonable level that 
reflects the operations and quality of the listed companies," Finance Minister 
Avraham Shohat said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers flooded the market, which had been closed since Shohat announced the 
10% tax on Wednesday. TASE officials said record sell orders of $660 million 
were lodged before trading started. 
</P>
<P>
 The benchmark Mishtanim index fell 18.22 points, or 9.93%, to 165.18. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot recall a day like this in years," said Yerah Nissan of United 
Mizrahi Bank on the tumultuous trading floor of the TASE. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in its 40-year history, TASE lifted a 10% limit on the 
fluctuation of share prices within a single day. Losses on individual share 
prices ranged between 10% and 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel is stock market-mad, even by the standards of industrialized Western 
countries. Even before Sunday, a bull market that had risen since the mid-1980s 
had fallen about 25% this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Tens of thousands of small investors dabble in stocks. The market trades fewer 
than 100 major shares yet supports hundreds of small portfolio managers, 
institutional investors and bank operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the TASE building, disgruntled investors and flag-waving opposition 
politicians called for Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's resignation. He had 
pledged there would be no capital-gains tax on the market this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shohat said he had no regrets about his announcement last week that he 
would kill the cash cow by taxing share profits 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have sat quietly in my office without making any fuss and perpetuated 
a situation where there was a 50% tax on labor in Israel, but share trading was 
tax free," he told Army Radio. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Tel Aviv bank branch, investors gathered to watch their holdings 
plummeting on a monitor. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it goes on like this for another 15 minutes, Rabin should resign," said 
Zvi, an old man who has played the market for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the revised tax proposal, investors can choose two options when buying 
stock. They could pay a flat 10% tax on any profits or take losses as tax 
deductions, subjecting any profits they made on the market to a 20% to 25% tax.

 Novell Earnings Fall Short: The big software company said it will report 
quarterly earnings of as low as 20 cents a share amid higher costs and 
less-than-expected revenue from recently acquired WordPerfect Corp. and Quattro 
Pro. Novell, the world's largest personal computer network-software company, 
"has initiated expense reductions to improve its profitability," though the 
cuts won't help third-quarter results, the company said in a statement.Novell 
is scheduled to report results for its third quarter ended July 30 after the 
stock market closes on Wednesday. Operating results will be as much as 20% 
below securities analysts' average forecast of 25 cents a share, the company 
said. In June, the company completed its acquisition of business software 
company WordPerfect for about $855 million in Novell shares. Novell also 
completed its purchase of Borland International Inc.'s Quattro Pro spreadsheet 
program business for $145 million in cash.

REVLON DISPUTES NEGATIVE STANDARD & POOR'S REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a highly unusual statement, Revlon Inc. disputed a negative report by Wall 
Street credit rating company Standard & Poor's and said its third-quarter 
operating income will rise by at least 100% from the year-ago period amid a 10% 
increase in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Revlon President and Chief Executive Jerry W. Levin said Sunday that the 
Standard & Poor's report issued Friday is "inaccurate." 
</P>
<P>
 "S&P's actions compel us publicly to correct their errors and, departing from 
our usual practice, forecast third-quarter and nine-month results on the basis 
of the company's performance thus far," Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Revlon, a subsidiary of Ronald Perelman's MacAndrews & Forbes Group Inc., is 
known for cosmetic and perfume products. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report on Friday, Standard & Poor's analyst Lucy Patricola said the 
rating company's outlook on $2.2 billion of debt of Revlon Worldwide Corp. and 
Revlon Consumer Products was revised to negative from positive. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricola attributed the revision to a disappointing pace of results since the 
cosmetics company restructured. The revamping began in 1991 with the closing of 
several plants, and continued with changes in manufacturing processes. 
</P>
<P>
 In its news release, Standard & Poor's said Revlon's "pre-depreciation 
operating income declined year over year, raising concerns as to the ultimate 
realization of Revlon's restructuring goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Revlon disputes Standard & Poor's statement. "Contrary to S&P's assertion that 
pre-depreciation operating income declined, Revlon in fact saw a 14% increase 
in that measurement for the first six months of 1994 compared to the same 
period last year," Revlon said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Revlon said that "this misstatement of a key index of Revlon's 
performance casts serious doubt on the validity of the report's conclusions 
regarding the pace of Revlon's growth." 
</P>
<P>
 Revlon said that its operating income rose 30% in the first half of 1994 
compared to that of 1993. Its operating income for the first nine months of 
1994 will increase at least 50% over the same period last year, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are dismayed by the inaccurate aspects of the report and by S&P's failure 
to contact Revlon prior to its publication to verify the data being presented 
to the marketplace," Revlon's Levin said. Patricola wasn't immediately 
available to comment.

STUDENTS WARNED OF PLASTIC PITFALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the next few weeks, millions of college students will buckle down to hours 
of lectures on Russian literature, advanced calculus, sociology and other 
esoteric subjects. What they also need, consumer advocates maintain, are a few 
lessons in the fine art of handling plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recommended there be mandatory personal-finance classes starting in junior 
high -- including credit education," said Ruth Susswein, executive director of 
Bankcard Holders of America in Salem, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, a representative of the consumer group testified before a 
House subcommittee on Consumer Credit and Insurance on the importance of 
educating youth in handling their personal finances. The group has also urged 
credit-card issuers to give some lessons of their own before they dispense 
cards on college campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 College students are getting plenty of exposure to marketing efforts on the 
part of card issuers competing to expand their customer base. The buying power 
of the college-age population is running at about $25 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 As classes resume, college students once again can expect to see stacks of 
applications for cards in book stores, student centers, dining halls and nearby 
businesses.

 Inflation Rate Inches Upward: China's inflation rate rose to 21.4% in July 
from 20% in June, according to retail price index figures from the State 
Statistics Bureau, the official China Daily reported.The newspaper said 
officials blamed the rising prices on sharply increased investment in fixed 
assets such as plant and equipment by state-owned enterprises. Investment in 
fixed assets rose 72.9% in the year to July, compared to 43.5% in the year to 
June. China is seeking to reduce its inflation rate to 13% by the end of the 
year.

 Unemployment Falls to Four-Year Low: New Zealand's unemployment rate fell to 
8.4% at the end of June from 9.0% three months earlier, revised from 9.1%, the 
government statistician said.Unemployment is now at its lowest level since 
September, 1990. The data are adjusted to remove seasonal fluctuations. "It 
(the drop) does sound good. The politicians will probably use it to their 
benefit," said Sean Newman, an economist at Australia & New Zealand Bank. "It 
shows the economy keeps growing." The New Zealand economy expanded 5.3% in the 
year ended March 31.

 Some Chinese Businessmen to Be Invited: Taiwan has decided in principle to 
allow businessmen from China to visit, to curb abuses of permits intended for 
cultural and academic trips, a senior government official said. The move came a 
day after the Cabinet approved a Communications Ministry request for a study of 
technical problems involved in direct transport links with China.Officials said 
that approval did not herald a change in a longstanding government ban on 
direct relations between Taiwan and the mainland. The preliminary decision by 
officials of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), which handles official policy 
toward China, would permit Chinese involved in the agriculture, business and 
communications sectors to visit Taiwan, MAC Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian told 
reporters.

3 DEFENDANTS ADDED TO KOREA BRIBERY SCANDAL

 Daewoo Group Chairman Kim Woo Choong and two other South Korean industrialists 
were indicted over the weekend on bribery charges, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 The others are Dong-A Construction Group Chairman Choi Won Suk and Samsung 
Engineering & Construction Chairman Park Ki Suk.They weren't detained 
physically. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Chung Hun Mok, former chairman of Hyundai Engineering & 
Construction, will be investigated on the same charge when he returns from his 
stay in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials said an extensive probe found that the bribery case, which 
emerged early this month with the arrest of a former cabinet minister, was 
broader than originally thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Samsung and Hyundai were not included in the scandal. But former 
Trade and Industry Minister Ahn Byung Hwa confessed to receiving an additional 
$375,000 each from the two companies in 1992, in exchange for special favors in 
the awarding of government projects, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahn had admitted taking $250,000 each from Daewoo's Kim, Dong-A's Choi and 
former Korean representative of the state-run Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. in 
1991, when was president of the Korea Electric Power Corp.

CONTROVERSY OVER BEAN FUTURES BOILS OVER; CHINA: A SENIOR BEIJING COMMODITIES 
EXCHANGE OFFICIAL DENIES TRADERS' CHARGES OF IRREGULARITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of Chinese futures traders has accused the fledgling Beijing Commodity 
Exchange of irregularities and demanded an inquiry into allegations of fraud in 
the green bean trade there. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior exchange official denied the charges Friday and said the actions in 
question were merely intended to curb speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy highlights the confusing state of the futures industry in 
China. The government is allowing only a few exchanges to stay in business, 
some after merging with smaller markets. Most have been ordered shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 The continuing clampdown is part of a government anti-inflation strategy 
designed to check price rises in key raw materials. Scores of futures contracts 
in commodities have been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Beijing maintains that China's futures have been influenced by price 
manipulators and become a haven for hot money from inside China and overseas, 
and especially from Hong Kong and Taiwan. All brokerages with foreign funding 
have been shut and are not expected to reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shanghai Petroleum Exchange all but closed early this year after Beijing 
capped the price of refined oil products -- ending speculation altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new Beijing flap, a group of commodity traders sent an open letter to 
the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the country's financial watchdog, 
demanding an inquiry into the allegations of irregularities by the exchange 
where they trade. The letter says the Beijing Commodity Exchange made two 
controversial announcements in a span of 100 trading minutes, causing severe 
fluctuations in the price of the January 1995 contract for green, or mung, 
beans. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like an emperor issuing an order in the morning and rescinding it in 
the evening," said one of the traders who organized the protest letter. 
</P>
<P>
 The first notice, issued late Aug. 17, banned compensation for buyers who had 
to take delivery of mung beans older than those specified in their contracts. 
The move sparked a selloff. The second notice early the next day in effect 
reversed the first, restoring compensation for a limited period. Traders, who 
were angered and confused by the move, said the exchange compounded the problem 
by posting the second notice well after morning trading had begun. 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange executive defended its actions, saying the announcements were 
designed to curb speculation and that they did not send conflicting signals. 
</P>
<P>
 "This exchange is not a casino," he said. "Our policy is reasonable and aims 
to prevent speculation. If no announcements had been made, Beijing would have 
become a garbage dump for old mung beans from the whole of China."

WAL-MART TO ENTER HONG KONG; RETAILING: THE DISCOUNT CHAIN TAKES ON AN ASIAN

 Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has announced a joint venture with Ek Chor Distribution 
System Co. under which it will operate discount stores and warehouse membership 
clubs in Hong Kong and China. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bentonville, Ark.-based discount retailer said the deal will enable it to 
open perhaps as many as four Value Club stores in Hong Kong this fall. Value 
Clubs are scaled-down versions of Wal-Mart's Sam's Clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ek Chor Distribution is a subsidiary of Charoen Pokphand Group, the largest 
agricultural and industrial company in Asia and a major foreign investor in 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob L. Martin, president and chief executive of Wal-Mart's international 
division, noted that the company will be expanding outside the Western 
Hemisphere for the first time. "This and other recent expansions into new 
markets are part of an ongoing strategy for the long-term growth of our 
company," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Wal-Mart purchased 122 stores in Canada from Woolworth 
Corp. and announced expansions into Argentina and Brazil. It also has stores 
and clubs in Mexico, through a joint venture with CIFRA SA. 
</P>
<P>
 Wal-Mart did not say how many stores it plans to establish in Asia or give 
definite opening dates. 
</P>
<P>
 It said the new outlets will be similar in concept than those in North 
America.

ASIAN OFFICE RENTS TOP WEST'S, SURVEY SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Office rents in Hanoi and in the Chinese cities of Shanghai and Beijing are 
more expensive than in New York or London, as emerging markets steam past the 
West in prices, according to a survey released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo offices are still the world's most costly, but Shanghai space fetches 
$76.83 per square foot -- $30.97 more than London's City financial area and 
$15.59 more than in Paris -- according to the survey, based on June prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnamese capital of Hanoi also turns out to be more expensive than 
London, Paris, Rome or Frankfurt, said property consultants Richard Ellis, 
which conducted the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Beijing office rents also top the prices in those European cities and in New 
York and Sydney, Australia. Richard Ellis attributed this to a price explosion 
in emerging markets and the opening to international investment, combined with 
shortages of the right kind of accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Shanghai and Beijing, shortages of suitable office accommodation are so 
acute that a number of foreign businesses are operating from hotel rooms," the 
company said.

 Government Moves to Protect Intellectual Property Rights: The lack of legal 
protection for intellectual property in China may have cost companies more than 
$58 billion, the official China Daily reported. Beijing has set up a national 
firm charged with evaluating so-called invisible assets, such as copyrights, in 
order to help curb such losses in the future, the paper said.The report did not 
name companies being defrauded by illegal copying, but American producers of 
computer software and audio-visual products believe that abuse of intellectual 
property rights in China costs them about $1 billion annually. In recent weeks, 
China has taken pains to show the world it is doing something to reduce the 
pirating of products, seeking to head off U.S. economic sanctions and gain 
entry to the World Trade Organization to be formed next year.

ON THE RIGHT TRACK; RAIL EXCURSION OFFERS A TASTE OF FILLMORE'S PLAN TO BOOST 
TOURISM 
</P>

<P>
 The vintage diesel engines pulling a train with nearly 400 revelers to an 
orange grove just west of Fillmore never got rolling faster than 10 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the party animals on board minded. 
</P>
<P>
 People who had met just minutes before clutched cans of beer or soda, hung out 
aging wooden windows, hooted and sang songs together as the train slowly 
chugged the five miles toward a spot beneath the towering San Cayetano 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40-minute trip was no Metrolink run. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a commute," said Rick Swanson, one of several volunteer car 
attendants on board. "This is a chance to kick back and enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
 People from throughout Ventura County and Greater Los Angeles converged in 
Fillmore on Saturday for a dinner-dance billed as "Hot August Nights." Some 
came from points as far-flung as Orange County, Pasadena and Oak View. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Fillmore Chamber of Commerce, the event included a barbecue 
dinner in a citrus grove, followed by dancing under a full moon to '50s and 
'60s music performed by Captain Cardiac and the Coronaries. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real draw, many said, was the circa-1940s diesel locomotives that 
pulled even older cars, including a Pullman sleeper built in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something about trains that just fascinates people," said Ruth 
Wilkerson, a 39-year-old Thousand Oaks woman who came for the ride with three 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a mystique to them. The whistles, the smoke, the cars. It just draws 
you in." 
</P>
<P>
 That is the type of sentiment the city of Fillmore hopes to capitalize on in 
coming months. Working with train concessionaire Short Line Railway, Fillmore 
leaders hope to offer regular dinner excursions by the beginning of next year, 
Councilman Roger Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to lure tourists -- and their tax dollars -- to Fillmore by 
remaking the city's downtown into a turn-of-the century train town, Campbell 
said. Included in the city's ambitious plans are a new city hall and a train 
depot, much like a smaller version of New York's Grand Central Station, with 
restaurants, shops and boutiques. 
</P>
<P>
 All will be built in a 1920s-era theme, complete with period architecture and 
lighting, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the centerpiece of the city's plan will be the trains owned by Short Line 
Railway. The company, based in Fillmore, has five vintage locomotives and 40 
cars in its stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Two steam engines are from the turn-of-the-century and three diesel engines 
are from the 1930s and '40s, spokesman Larry Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rail cars span 20 years, from the 1920s to the 1940s, Jensen said. When 
the dinner runs begin, the railway will be known as the Fillmore & Western 
Railroad, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trains owned by Short Line now are occasionally leased for special events, 
such as the annual fund-raiser by the Chamber of Commerce. The company makes 
most of its money renting the trains to movie crews for filming, Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dinner excursions can't get started until Southern Pacific Railroad 
relinquishes control over the tracks. Ventura County, working with the Ventura 
County Transportation Commission and the cities of Santa Paula and Fillmore, is 
negotiating to buy 39 miles of tracks between Piru and Montalvo. 
</P>
<P>
 That $10-million purchase from Southern Pacific is expected to close by the 
end of the year, Campbell said. After that, Short Line will be free to begin 
dinner excursions along the entire length of track, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said the train excursions could attract people from around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main attraction is the train, but they also come for the ambience of the 
town. What is better than smelling orange blossoms while cruising through the 
Santa Clara Valley aboard a steam locomotive?" 
</P>
<P>
 If Saturday's high-spirited fest is any indication, Campbell could be right. 
</P>
<P>
 With a minimum of advertising, the chamber sold all 350 tickets at $45 each 
for the dinner-dance. Some people even asked to be placed on a waiting list, 
chamber Director Hank Carillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some complained that there was not enough food, that the lines for 
the bar were too long and that the band started too late, people for the most 
part seemed to be enjoying themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Bland, a retired Hollywood resident, bought eight tickets so she could 
take a group of friends to the dance. Bland also rented a white stretch 
limousine for the group, bringing her total tab for the night to $700. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do something really different for them," Bland said. "When I 
heard about this, I said, 'That's it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 While Bland's group led rousing renditions of "Swing Low" and "Sentimental 
Journey" in one of the more modern cars, two couples from Simi Valley peered 
out the window of their Pullman sleeper car. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pullman car features authentic red velvet bench seats that face each other 
and overhead compartments that convert to sleeping chambers. Mimi Norman said 
she chose the Pullman car for her ride after passing over another old car 
filled with white plastic chairs for seating. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman called that one the "Kmart car." 
</P>
<P>
 "It has all those lawn chairs in it," she said. "Tacky. Tacky. This is much 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Car attendant Swanson, a member of the Santa Clara River Valley Railroad 
Historical Society, said his group plans to help Short Line renovate each car 
with period seating and fixtures. But the work is slow because of a shortage of 
funds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen of Short Line said his company also is negotiating to buy dining cars 
so dinner can be served on the train once the excursion runs begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Campbell, he has high hopes for the railway's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just a great little valley for tourism," Jensen said. "It's 
undiscovered and it's so close to Los Angeles. It can become the next Solvang."

VENTURA COUNTY FAIR; THOUSANDS DRAWN TO LATIN-STYLE FIESTA DAY; FESTIVAL: A 
LITTLE BIT OF MEXICO COMES TO EL NORTE AS TROUPES DANCE AND MAKE MUSIC THAT 
RECALLS HOME FOR MANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Thousands of visitors were drawn to Ventura's Seaside Park on Sunday for the 
Ventura County Fair's annual Fiesta Day, a celebration of Latin music and 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only day with Mexican events all day," said Luis Jungo of Ojai. 
He brought his wife, Rosario, and their five children, who range in age from 8 
to 14. 
</P>
<P>
 While some of Jungo's children looked forward to the carnival rides on the 
midway, Luis Sr. came for the music and performances, which remind him of the 
land where he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 The family, he said, would definitely make the afternoon Fiesta Show, a 
Spanish-language extravaganza with eight bands that packs the Grandstand Arena 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel like we are in Mexico" at the Fiesta Show, said Luis Sr., who enjoyed 
Fiesta Day with his family last year as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The activities began with a performance by Grupo Folklorico Cuicapan, a 
children's troupe that offered traditional Latin American dances. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-year-old Daniela Pollard enjoyed the show so much that she danced along 
with the performers from the sidelines, said her mother, Lorena Pollard, who 
was born in El Salvador and moved to the United States 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The family drove up from Glendale at the urging of Pollard's boyfriend, who 
works at a booth at the fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me about all the stuff going on today, and it all sounded 
interesting," Pollard said as her daughter twirled on the grass. "Having all 
this Hispanic entertainment, it's a nice change." 
</P>
<P>
 Over at the Miller Stage, the band Extafis charmed the crowd in the bleachers 
with Spanish-language music lively enough to get some couples off the benches 
and onto the impromptu, hay-strewn dance floor in front of the risers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love Latin music!" exclaimed Joe Pardo of Thousand Oaks, still breathless 
from spinning his wife, Caro, around the dance floor. "We like the beat and 
it's easy to dance to. It's just fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pardos said they try to never to miss a Fiesta Day at the County Fair. Joe 
likes the tempo of Latin music and Caro cherishes the tunes because they remind 
her of Mexico City, where she grew up. The couple were married there 2 1/2 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love (Mexico) and I love my music," Caro said as they ambled off to see an 
exhibit or two before the next performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance figures for Fiesta Day were not available Sunday, but officials 
said it is traditionally the best-attended day of the fair. It also usually 
falls on the fair's last day, although this year the event fell on the fifth 
day. The 12-day festival will end next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall attendance so far is down slightly from the same time last year, 
officials said. As of the end of Saturday's festivities, 73,155 people had 
visited the 1994 fair, 6% fewer than the tally at the same day in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But since entertainment varies from year to year, such comparisons are not 
strictly valid until the fair is further along, said spokesman Devlin Raley. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way to do an apple and an apple out of this," he said. "Here I am, 
comparing attendance for this Thursday, when we had sprint car racing, to the 
first Thursday last year, when we had the Charlie Daniels Band. I'm comparing 
Fiesta Day this Sunday to motocross from the first Sunday last year."

THOUSAND OAKS ALL-STARS WELCOMED LIKE WINNERS; YOUTH: JUNIOR LEAGUE WORLD 
SERIES CHAMPIONS DOMINATED OHIO OPPONENT, DESPITE MUSTACHIOED OUTFIELDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They faced rain, mosquitoes, even 6-foot-tall outfielders with mustaches. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 13-year-old baseball players from Thousand Oaks came home champions 
Sunday, clinching Little League baseball's Junior League World Series the day 
before with a stunning 20-3 victory over an Ohio team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like the best game of the whole year," said Wes Munyon, an outfielder 
for the all-star team, bringing together the best players from different teams 
in the Thousand Oaks Little League. "We all played a good game." 
</P>
<P>
 The flash of cameras and whirl of video recorders greeted the 14 players as 
they returned to Los Angeles International Airport parading their World Series 
banner, the first Thousand Oaks has won. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give me a T!" shouted one woman in the crowd of cheering parents and 
supporters. "Give me an O!" she continued, as a few other enthusiastic parents 
joined the call. 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents had just returned from Taylor, Mich., where they watched the team 
trounce the oversized 13-year-olds from Hamilton, Ohio, on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Heyne, whose son, Jeff, is an outfielder, spent the game on the telephone 
to California, providing play-by-play commentary for a radio station. 
</P>
<P>
 The game had its share of highlights. Shortstop Kevin Howard hit two three-run 
homers in the first two innings. Pitcher Chris Strauser, his hands swollen from 
an allergic reaction to mosquito bites, managed a no-hitter for six of the 
game's seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Wes caught a fly ball at the fence with two outs and two players on base, 
costing Ohio three runs. And 12 of Thousand Oaks' 14 players either had hits or 
scored runs. It was a backup player, Aaron Borenstein, who caught the high fly 
to center field for the final out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our bench was one of the reasons that we got here," said Thousand Oaks coach 
Craig Frazier. "We had the best bench in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches and parents also credit the team's long history together for its 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids have been together since they were 8," Tim Heyne said. "We always 
thought they could win a World Series." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the winners have also played together on other all-star teams over the 
years. Eleven of the 14 members were part of a team that came close to winning 
a division title last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Howard, then playing for a Woodland Hills team, was part of the squad 
that defeated the Thousand Oaks boys last year, ending their World Series 
aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, Thousand Oaks coaches and players persuaded Kevin to join his 
hometown team. His pitching and hitting, including the two homers in the 
championship game, helped clinch the title. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a team that was ready to bust out, and they finally did," said Ed 
Kitchen, the team's manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitchen began working with the players last year, when they were competing in 
tournaments for 11- and 12-year-old boys. He and Frazier kept the team working 
together throughout the winter and early spring, competing with older players 
at times. The parents hired a coach, Mark Davis, to work with the team's 
pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 During this year's regular season, the boys who were later picked for the 
winning all-star team played on six different Little League teams. The same 
group came back together in late June and played their first game as a team in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen games and four tournaments later, they won a place in this year's 
World Series for teams of 13-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks players opened the series with a victory over Puerto Rico, 
whose team won the tournament last year. Thousand Oaks then defeated the 
Florida champions and the Ohio team for a place in the final game. 
</P>
<P>
 There they met the Ohio team again. The skies threatened rain, something the 
manager feared would stump his fair-weather team from Southern California. 
Chris Strauser's hands were puffy from mosquito bites. And the Ohio athletes 
towered over their Thousand Oaks counterparts. Some players said the Ohio team 
had the tallest players they'd seen in the tournament, some even sporting 
mustaches. 
</P>
<P>
 But from the first inning, the local boys dominated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team from Ohio can't play year-round," Kitchen said. "We do. That's why 
we're so seasoned." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the World Series title amazed him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year the odds are 7,200 to 1," said Kitchen, his Windbreaker still 
spattered with mud from the roughhousing after Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitchen took off his cap and revealed the stubble of a newly shaved head. "I 
told the kids if we made it to the World Series, I'd shave my head," he said, 
grinning. He let each player take a turn with the clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 The team can go at it again next year in the competition for 14- and 
15-year-old boys. But in another year, the players could begin joining high 
school teams, too old for Little League. At least two of the team members, 
Kevin Howard and Chris Strauser, hope for professional careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the goal of my life," Kevin said. 
</P>
<P>
 As he talked about his life's goals, teammates hurried him into the waiting 
limousine that would whisk them off to a radio interview at KNJO in Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The team roster also includes Fran Adams, Manuel Apodaco, Ryan Ayers, Ethan 
East, Doug Hutton, Zeke Morrow, Kris Palomares, Matt Rogers and Jon Shepard.

STREET SMART: LONG ROAD AHEAD FOR SEASIDE BIKE PATH AND TRAIL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Once a week I like to ride my bike through Oxnard and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite routes run along the ocean, but there is no continuous beachfront 
route. 
</P>
<P>
 Are there any plans to establish a continuous bike path along the beach? 
</P>
<P>
 Irene Adelson, Oxnard 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 How does a 220-mile-long trail system complete with long beachfront path 
sound? 
</P>
<P>
 As you read this, just such a project is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Blakemore, administrator of the county's Regional Trails and Pathways 
Program, is busy seeking approval from 50 or so government agencies before 
taking the trail proposal to the Board of Supervisors next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal includes a path that would follow the beach near Harbor Drive, 
wind though Mandalay State Beach and continue through McGrath State Beach and 
on to Channel Islands Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be years, however, before the path is actually built. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a mammoth project," Blakemore says. "We're just getting started." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 There is a "no right turn on red" restriction at a Camarillo intersection that 
I think is unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 I frequently drive west on Pleasant Valley Road, turning right onto northbound 
Las Posas Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Right turns on red are not permitted, so I often get stuck waiting until the 
light turns green. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes this so infuriating is that rarely is there any cross traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 I suspect someone from traffic engineering will say the signal restriction is 
intended for late afternoon, when there is a lot of traffic coming from Point 
Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bottom line in my opinion is that the restriction should be removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Murphy, Camarillo 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Camarillo does not share your opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 At least not for now. 
</P>
<P>
 The speed limit on Las Posas north of Pleasant Valley is 50 m.p.h. South of 
Las Posas it is 50 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Because traffic is moving at such high speeds, it would not be safe to allow 
motorists to turn onto Las Posas on a red light, says traffic engineer Tom Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in 1996 the city is planning to completely overhaul the intersection, 
Fox says. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the project, the city is considering a redesign that would allow 
right turns on red. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I wrote in several months ago about a problem with the timing of lights on New 
Los Angeles Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 You responded that the delays were caused by missing or damaged traffic 
detectors. But the timing problems persist. 
</P>
<P>
 Why are the lights on New Los Angeles Avenue still not synchronized? 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes you can get through without hitting a single red light, while other 
times you are forced to stop at every light. 
</P>
<P>
 The way it is now is like living in the dark ages. Is there any reason why the 
traffic can't go smoothly through there? 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Zarky, Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, there is a reason. 
</P>
<P>
 The signals at Park Lane and Liberty Bell Road are timed to change color 
simultaneously, but as you have noted, there is no guarantee this pattern will 
continue farther down the road, namely at New Los Angeles Avenue and Moorpark 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason? High traffic volume and an abnormal traffic signal. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavy traffic flow at that intersection prompted Caltrans to install a 
signal outfitted with several left turn arrows and specially timed green, red 
and yellow lights, says Caltrans traffic engineer Bob Houle. 
</P>
<P>
 What this means is that the signal is timed to function on its own, ensuring 
that traffic gets through the intersection smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 Since this signal does not operate on a "normal" timing schedule, it would be 
impossible to match its green lights with those of others down the road, Houle 
says.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: BANK REPORTS SALE OF SUBSIDIARY CANCELED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County National Bank has announced that the planned sale of its Orange 
County-based subsidiary to Peninsula Bank has been called off because they 
could not agree on a final purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
 VCNB President and Chief Executive Officer Richard Cupp said that Peninsula 
Bank in Palos Verdes was going to buy its subsidiary, Frontier Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 When the sale was first reported in early July, Cupp said the price would be 
$7 million for Frontier Bank, which has assets of $96 million and branches in 
La Palma and Wilmington. Cupp said then that the sale was necessary to meet 
capital requirements for VCNB established last year by the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency following its investigation of the bank's 
management and operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Cupp did not say whether VCNB had other potential buyers for Frontier. MARY F.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; OLD-TIME FUN SHINES DOWN ON SEASIDE FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Griffin and Nicole Williamson spent their first anniversary Sunday pedaling 
down the Ventura Pier promenade in a rented carriage, stopping long enough only 
to take in the sights and sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted something fun to do, so we came to the beach," said Griffin, a 
20-year-old accounting clerk from Ventura. "We just got back from Las Vegas 
this morning, where we got married a year ago today." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of people toured the promenade north of the pier at the weekend 
Summer by the Sea concert and arts fair. The weekend festival series continues 
through Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Music, food and arts and crafts booths lined the promenade, with vendors 
selling everything from snow cones and plaster angels to tie-dyed clothing and 
handmade jewelry. For Kevin Mansfield, the summer fair series is a chance to do 
a brisk business. He tie-dyes shirts, pants and anything else he can think of 
to sell at open markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a hobby that I turned into a career," said Mansfield, 36, of Santa 
Barbara. "People seem to like it, and I get to hang out at the beach. Half the 
fun is watching the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Mansfield, who has sold his wares along the promenade most weekends this 
summer, said the Ventura County Fair, which runs through Sunday, has lured 
customers away. "It's a little slower today than most weekends," he said, "so 
it must be because of the fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob and Lisa Whitney of Simi Valley liked a pair of plaster angels so much 
they spent $17 on a set. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have some really nice stuff here," said Lisa, wrapping up her purchases 
in a day-old newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Whitney said the couple wanted to get away from the east county heat, if 
only for a few hours. After touring the county celebration just north of the 
promenade, they visited the street fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just walking down the boardwalk," said Whitney, also an accountant. "We 
didn't even know this existed. It's nice and cool and the weather's beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Brukiewa of West Hills packed up his 9-month-old son, Jacob, and his two 
teen-age daughters early Sunday and headed west. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's actually a very pleasant experience," said Brukiewa, an engineer, 
slurping snow cones with his family. "People are a lot nicer here than they are 
in L.A." JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER SKATEBOARD PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON GRANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ojai Parks and Recreation Commission will ask the City Council on Tuesday 
to consider building a skateboarding facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Belser, Ojai director of recreation, said the commission has received 
favorable community response to the idea of constructing a skateboard park in 
Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the commission conducted two student surveys this past spring -- one 
at Matilija Junior High School and one at Nordhoff High School. At Matilija, 
46% of those surveyed said they would regularly use a skateboard facility; at 
Nordhoff, 58% said they would use it, Belser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Belser said, a questionnaire sent to local merchants and adult residents 
yielded 174 favorable responses and only two unfavorable comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Singer, assistant to the city manager, said the commission was also 
spurred to consider building a skateboard park because merchants from Ojai's 
Arcade -- an outdoor shopping strip with dozens of stores -- have expressed 
displeasure with youths skateboarding near their stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer said merchants are worried that skateboarders who ride on curbs, 
benches, plant boxes and sidewalks near their stores are disrupting business 
and unintentionally destroying some property. 
</P>
<P>
 Belser said if council members back the idea, the commission will form a task 
force. The task force would first investigate to determine whether enough 
support exists in the community. Funds for a skateboard bowl and/or ramps would 
have to be raised from donations, she said. JASON GRANT

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; 2 HURT WHEN PLANE STRIKES THEIR VEHICLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The pilot of a light private plane that ran out of gas made an emergency 
landing on a Simi Valley street and slammed into a car carrying two Northern 
California tourists, Simi Valley police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Both tourists suffered moderate cuts and bruises but the 18-year-old student 
pilot was uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilot Scott Howard of Big Bear left Palm Springs Airport about 7:30 p.m. 
Saturday to return to Big Bear, but became lost and ended up in Simi Valley, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After running out of fuel, Howard managed to land the Cessna 172 safely on the 
northbound side of Stearns Street, just south of Cochran Street about 10:20 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 But the aircraft struck an oncoming car driven by Janett Kline of Concord, who 
was traveling with her husband, Harvey Kline. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Janett Kline, 32, and Harvey Kline, 41, suffered moderate cuts and 
bruises and were transported to Simi Valley Hospital. She was treated and later 
released, and her husband was listed in stable condition Sunday, hospital 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fortunate that more serious injuries or death were avoided," Simi Valley 
Police Sgt. Arch Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane caught fire after striking the Klines' car, but the blaze was 
extinguished by officers and bystanders at the scene, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, who was not injured in the incident, was described Sunday as an 
excellent pilot by officials at the Aero Haven Flying School in Big Bear, where 
he has been enrolled for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard could not be reached for comment on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the crash. JEFF McDONALD

BETWEEN UPDATES ON CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS . . . ; SIDESHOW: THERE MAY BE AT

FAN'S IN FAVOR OF PUTTING ALL THOSE GUYS IN SILLY SUITS ON WAIVERS.

 A baseball season is a terrible thing to waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Greedy millionaires squaring off against greedy millionaires? That's only 
supposed to happen when movie deals are being made. 
</P>
<P>
 But like every unpleasant, name-calling work stoppage, the baseball strike has 
a silver lining. 
</P>
<P>
 The game has been threatened by an insidious trend that could bring it down 
faster than you can say "Whitewater." That trend? Not the designated hitter, 
not artificial turf, not even organists who play eight bars of "Guadalajara, 
Guadalajara" after every pitch for no apparent reason. 
</P>
<P>
 It's mascots. Guys in chicken suits, parrot suits, generic bird suits, fish 
suits, turtle suits, dinosaur suits. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike means there are no mascots jumping on dugouts, hamming it up with 
terrified 3-year-olds or pretending to sweep dirt on umpires' feet. 
</P>
<P>
 How did these guys get started? you may ask. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it a plot to destroy baseball by the communists, the religious right or 
the National Football League? 
</P>
<P>
 No. It started innocently enough in San Diego as a promotion for a rock radio 
station. A guy whose qualifications included fitting into the outfit was hired 
to put on a furry chicken suit (even though few chickens actually have fur) and 
wander through the stadium, handing out coupons for records. 
</P>
<P>
 Records, of course, were black vinyl discs that played music when spun around 
rapidly on a machine. But that's another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego Padres customarily lose more games than they win, and perhaps he 
was supposed to keep people from noticing that detail. Soon, like an 
infestation of Medflies, the mascot idea spread to Pittsburgh, Montreal, 
Philadelphia, Baltimore and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 In Baltimore, home of the Orioles, the mascot wears a kind of bird suit. In 
Philadelphia, the team is called the Phillies. But because nobody knows what 
the heck a Phillie is, the mascot is just sort of a vague bloblike creature who 
stands on the dugout and keeps people in the front row from watching the game. 
</P>
<P>
 In Montreal, of course, the mascot can be annoying in two languages. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Dodgers don't have a mascot. Neither, to their credit, do the 
New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox, Detroit Tigers and several other baseball 
teams that have what is known as tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig were Yankees. They never had to high-five a guy in a 
bird suit after hitting a home run. Neither did the Dodgers' Roy Campanella or 
Duke Snider. Ted Williams of the Red Sox would have wrung the neck of a guy in 
a chicken suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Piniella is the manager of the Seattle Mariners. They don't have a mascot. 
As long as Piniella is there, they probably never will. When he was playing for 
the Yankees, Piniella once was chosen to play in an All-Star Game. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the game began, the first chicken-suit guy -- the one from San Diego -- 
came up behind Piniella, mimicking his walk and matching him, stride for 
stride, as he walked to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 When he became aware the guy was there, Piniella took off his glove and fired 
it at the creature, hitting him right in the ol' giblets. When a writer 
suggested that Piniella had overreacted, he responded: "If people think a guy 
in a chicken suit is so funny, why don't they dress up nine guys like chickens, 
let them play baseball, and have one man dressed in a baseball uniform so 
people will remember what we looked like?" 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever game highlights are shown on the news, you can count on footage of a 
mascot running around near the dugout, along with a shot of a guy in a tank 
top, holding a sign that says, "MARRY ME, ANGIE." But that great play by the 
shortstop? Sorry, time's up. 
</P>
<P>
 Just maybe, if the strike lasts long enough, those mascots will have to find 
real jobs. Of course, if the players get their way, the owners will be the guys 
wearing the chicken suits.

 If you're suffering withdrawal pangs because of the baseball strike, there's 
no need to throw yourself off the Dodger Stadium scoreboard or bean yourself 
with a Louisville Slugger. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a whole roster of ways baseball addicts can satisfy their craving 
until major league umpires once again call, "Play ball!" 
</P>
<P>
 As the Los Angeles Dodgers' team psychiatrist, Dr. Herndon Harding Jr. usually 
offers advice to troubled players. But he says upset fans are suffering a 
slight form of depression similar to grief. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've lost something important to your life. You've lost people you identify 
with, including some that you know everything about." 
</P>
<P>
 He says exercise will pump up your adrenaline and improve your outlook. 
Participating in other enjoyable activities can also elevate your mood. Some 
people will do the worst thing possible -- pig out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since you've lost something important, you try to replace it by filling it 
up, and some people will try to fill it up by eating," Harding says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's much healthier if you fill it up with minor league games or something 
that will benefit you as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some healthy ways to get your baseball fix. 
</P>
<P>
 --  
</P>
<P>
 Rent a baseball movie: There are lots of classics, old and new, available on 
video. They include: 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Pride of the Yankees" (1942) -- A drama based on the career of New York 
Yankees' slugger Lou Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Damn Yankees" (1958) -- A middle-aged fan sells his soul to the devil to 
become a young player and lead the Washington Senators to the pennant. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars and Motor Kings" (1976) -- Black 
professional players in 1939 start their own team. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Bull Durham" (1988) -- An aging catcher is sent to the Durham Bulls to 
baby-sit a dimwitted up-and-coming pitcher and ends up falling for a sexy 
groupie. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Field of Dreams" (1989) -- An Iowa farmer builds a baseball field in the 
middle of his farm. 
</P>
<P>
 * "A League of Their Own" (1992) -- Women's baseball league is born when most 
of the male players march off to World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 --  
</P>
<P>
 Go see the angels: "Angels in the Outfield" that is -- the Hollywood fantasy 
about a so-so ball team and a kid who sees angels. The new version is showing 
at theaters all over. Or look for the 1951 edition at your video store. 
</P>
<P>
 --  
</P>
<P>
 Read a baseball book: The best of the many baseball novels are "The Southpaw" 
and "Bang the Drum Slowly," both by Mark Harris; "The Natural," by Bernard 
Malamud; "The Great American Novel," by Philip Roth, and "The Universal 
Baseball Assn. Inc.," by Robert Coover, says Prof. Cordelia Candelaria, who 
teaches baseball fiction at Arizona State University. 
</P>
<P>
 Highly regarded nonfiction works include Roger Kahn's "The Boys of Summer," 
Eliot Asinof's "Eight Men Out" and Roger Angell's collections of essays, "The 
Summer Game," "Late Innings" and "Season Ticket." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Get the big picture: Ken Burns' much-anticipated nine-part public television 
miniseries, "Baseball," runs on KCET Channel 28 from 8 to 10 p.m. Sept. 18-22 
and Sept. 25-28.

COMMITMENTS; FALLING IN LOVE IN L.A.; CUPID'S ARROWS PIERCE THE CITY OF ANGELS, 
WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM 'MR. ROMANCE' AND HIS BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Badal, 38, is perpetually mellow, wears mostly jeans and open-collared 
shirts, and has a mustache and full red mane that make him appear positively 
leonine. He rents a treehouse-like duplex in the Hollywood Hills and calls 
himself Mr. Romance, lecturing frequently throughout Southern California on the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas A. Campbell, 65, is an investment banker who wears custom-made suits 
and has short, white hair. He lives in Holmby Hills, where he just had what he 
says is Southern California's largest man-made waterfall built in his back 
yard, with red boulders imported from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Romance and Mr. Finance joined forces after they fell in love with the 
same damsel in distress: Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of their partnership will arrive in bookstores next month, a nearly 
800-page valentine to Los Angeles called "Romancing the Southland" (Romancing 
the West Inc.) -- written by first-time author Badal and backed by first-time 
publisher Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 They hope to reinvigorate Los Angeles as a destination for those who seek 
romance. Their plans include an interactive, CD-ROM version of the 
unconventional guidebook, which Badal spent nine years researching. 
</P>
<P>
 "My love for Los Angeles is what has driven me to do this book," Badal said. 
"I want people to see the odd juxtapositions of L.A. -- such as the flowering 
dogwood next to the urban bizarreness of Melrose Avenue. . . . And nature? 
There's more rare bird sightings in San Diego than any other county and Los 
Angeles is second." 
</P>
<P>
 Among other oddities, the book describes where to find a flock of lesbian sea 
gulls studied by the University of California on one of the Channel Islands, 
and the delights of taking a date to the Air Conditioning Refrigeration Museum 
in Downtown on a hot August afternoon. It also contains entries on the best 
time to see elephant seals mate, where to walk through a petrified forest and 
how to find a Hansel and Gretel-style cottage just off one of Beverly Hills' 
busiest intersections. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way he covers the areas I know very well makes me trust the way he writes 
about places I've never known," said Barbara Mars of the California Map Center 
in Santa Monica, a travel bookstore, after previewing some chapters. "He's 
convinced me that I should visit the Inland Empire." 
</P>
<P>
 Badal has spent the past 16 years giving lectures throughout Southern 
California on topics ranging from flirting to finding a mate. Earlier this 
year, he applied to the U.S. Patents Office for a trademark for the title "Mr. 
Romance." Approval could take two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine years ago, Campbell was dragged reluctantly by a female friend to one of 
Badal's seminars -- "50 Unusual and Romantic Things to Do in Los Angeles" at 
the Learning Annex -- and met his future publishing partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaining a serious backer allowed Badal to realize his dream of putting out an 
unconventional book that combined his two loves -- Los Angeles and, well, love 
. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't need me to tell you where Disneyland is. I always liked it when 
people tell me they've lived here all their lives and didn't know about the 
obscure places I tell them about," said Badal, who was reared in the San 
Fernando Valley. "Where I grew up it was chic to trash L.A., but I hate it when 
people say nasty things about the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Badal's girlfriend is an actress working with a Shakespeare company in 
Northern California. "I tried to enjoy that area of the state, but I need 
something with an edge, someplace with a bit of nastiness," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Campbell and his circle of successful friends, Badal said he has 
gained an appreciation for the entrepreneurial spirit. In the book, he 
highlights individuals who take big risks to promote their unusual restaurants 
or other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a tremendous empathy for someone who puts themselves on the line for a 
little store and I want to see them do well," Badal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Having steeped himself in the region's cultural diversity, he discusses 
Japanese immigration, Cambodian and Armenian festivals, Indian restaurants, 
Persian bakeries and African American art. The Gay and Lesbian Center of Los 
Angeles has invited Badal to give a romance lecture to same-sex couples on Nov. 
19 because he devoted part of a chapter to gay pride events. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want everyone to identify with this book and I don't want to limit this to 
couples, because you can romance the Southland by yourself," Badal said. "I use 
the word romance like sugar so people think it's all sweetness, but I want to 
inspire a bit of regional pride and teach some history." 
</P>
<P>
 The inspiration for the book came one day at the beach when Badal was reading 
"I, Claudius." He looked up in the direction of the Getty Museum and thought to 
himself, "This is Rome, we live in Rome." 
</P>
<P>
 His eclectic views on the art world cause him to mention everything from the 
country's largest Jean Cocteau collection at the Severin Wunderman Museum in 
Irvine to the whimsical pig mural in Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived here since 1968 and I'm overwhelmed at what I am learning about in 
this book," said Campbell, who was born in Canada. "L.A. has had such a bad rap 
with what I call the five Rs: rainfall, riot, recession, raging fires and the 
earthquake -- which I call the rumble. 
</P>
<P>
 "This city has had more problems than anywhere else in the United States and I 
like buying cheap stocks and promoting what's at the bottom. It's got nowhere 
to go but up."

FIRST PERSON: A CURSE ON THOSE TIMES WHEN 'DANG' JUST WON'T DO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE BAWDEN DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One day about a year ago, I stormed into my chiropractor's office after a 
careless driver ran me off the road. Using a torrent of unprintable language, I 
told my doctor exactly what I thought of stupid drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I flopped exhausted into a chair beside his desk and apologized. "Sorry," 
I said. "I'm just upset. Hopefully no one heard me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't worry about it," he said with a laugh. "Cussing is good for you." 
</P>
<P>
 He told me about his 90-year-old mother, who is in "really good shape," and 
that she tells people it is because "I don't drink, I don't smoke, but I cuss." 
</P>
<P>
 That day was an eye-opener for me. Since then, I've come to the conclusion 
that cussing is indeed good for what ails you. When I'm angry, a steady stream 
of four-letter words makes me feel much better. 
</P>
<P>
 Some faint-mouthed souls might suggest I take a bubble bath or meditate 
instead. Sure, that sounds great. But when you're late and caught in traffic or 
someone has just really ticked you off, turning on the tub or stopping to zone 
out aren't really options. 
</P>
<P>
 Cussing is simple to do, can be done almost anywhere, costs nothing and gives 
you immediate gratification. If you worry about upsetting others, you can even 
cuss in your head and offend no one. 
</P>
<P>
 I agree that you should never expose young children to cussing. I have a 
3-year-old daughter, and when I'm with her it's heck, shoot and geez . But when 
she's not around, when I'm in the privacy of my own room or talking on the 
phone to a close friend or relative about something upsetting, the closet 
cusser in me emerges. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't get me wrong. I can go whole days without cussing. When you first meet 
me, I censor my language. I probably won't cuss in front of you for months. 
</P>
<P>
 I also believe that cussing shouldn't be done for cussing's sake. I can't 
stand movies where every other word is a cuss word. I also find nothing amusing 
about a comedian who constantly cusses because he or she has no imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Cussing is like anything else -- if you overdo it, it loses its significance 
and can sound silly. But well-placed, well-chosen cuss words can be quite 
powerful. Just ask my husband, who knows how mad I am by the cuss words I 
choose. When he hears certain words, he knows things are serious. 
</P>
<P>
 I've even taught close friends how powerful and stress-reducing cussing can 
be. Before we met seven years ago, one friend rarely cussed and had never said 
a few of the really "bad" words. After hanging around me for a while that 
changed, to the disbelief of her mild-mannered husband. Now when she starts 
cussing, he'll say, "You've been hanging around Julie again." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than be ashamed of her newfound skill, my friend told me that when 
she's angry, nothing makes her feel better than spouting a few choice words. 
She's found cussing works especially well with her husband. Recently when they 
were visiting relatives and he sat immobile on the couch while help was 
obviously needed, she swept by and hissed an unprintable directive. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our 28 years of marriage," she marveled to me later, "I've never seen him 
move so fast." 
</P>
<P>
 I know many people would never dream of saying certain "gutter" words, but 
frankly, I don't know what the fuss is about. The truth is, words are what we 
make them. People assign significance to "bad" words. We could have easily 
branded phooey or fiddlesticks with negative meanings, but we didn't. If people 
didn't give cuss words such a bad reputation, maybe there would be less shock 
and disappointment when they're used. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd suggest to anyone who feels bad about cussing to cast off the guilt and 
see how much freer you feel when you let loose with a few four-letter words. 
</P>
<P>
 And for those who have led cuss-free lives up until now, don't knock it until 
you try it. The next time you're upset, cuss all alone and see how much better 
you feel.  
</P>
<P>
 You never know. You may find cussing to be a calming influence. If not, I have 
a few things to say about that. But you'll have to use your imagination.

STORAGE-SPACE SCAVENGERS; AUCTIONS: BIDDERS VIE FOR ABANDONED GOODS. THE 
DISCOVERIES CAN BE REWARDING -- OR REPULSIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just a moment before the auction, bidders had begun to shine flashlight beams 
into a 5-by-7-foot rental storage room, looking at the outside of cardboard 
boxes for clues to their contents. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until top bidder Ed Zaharoff had loaded the containers into his van 
that he noticed small, jagged holes in the bottoms of his new boxed belongings. 
And it was not until he started driving that he heard the screeches. 
</P>
<P>
 For $400, Zaharoff had become the proud owner of four boxes of rat families 
and the rags they called home. 
</P>
<P>
 Zaharoff is a storage-space scavenger, one of hundreds who travel from auction 
to auction, their hunting grounds the storage rooms abandoned by owners for at 
least 60 days. The scavengers are willing to bid up to thousands of dollars, 
hoping to find treasures in someone else's leavings. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think they can get rich in this business," said Zaharoff, a six-year 
veteran of the blind auctions. "I'm still working at Ralphs. I haven't found a 
gold mine."  
</P>
<P>
 What Zaharoff did find last week, for $2,300 at an auction of rent delinquent 
storage rooms in Northridge, were three badly decayed human bodies. While 
police continue to try to determine the identities of the victims and how they 
ended up in two steamer trunks and a box, Zaharoff and the other regulars 
continue to scavenge, hoping for luckier breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time, they find boxes filled with odds and ends of people's lives: 
tattered clothing and scratchy dishes, reams of papers and household 
knickknacks. It's the sort of recyclable junk that might fetch a few dollars at 
a swap meet. Enough, the treasure hunters hope, to at least reimburse them for 
their bid. 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes, they do find treasures, such as the crayon box among a room's 
contents bought by Randi Cram of Whittier for $400 that hid a $4,000 Rolex 
watch. 
</P>
<P>
 The storage space auction game requires careful strategy. Magic Marker labels 
can be deceptive; crystal can be a woman's name or it can be the fancy label 
given to regular kitchen drinking glasses packed in newspaper. Boxes with 
factory brand names cannot be counted on to contain those items; gamblers all 
have memories of sealed boxes that promised Sony TVs or Apple computers, but 
turned out to be empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something can look real good and it ends up being the stuff of a bagman or 
something," said Zaharoff, who was refunded the $2,300 he paid when he ended up 
with the three bodies. "Sometimes people don't know the value of something and 
they put it in storage. Happens all the time, that's what we hope for." 
</P>
<P>
 Myths of the trade -- both horrible and grand -- abound. Someone "back East" 
found a severed finger in a bag full of clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone "up North" paid $500 for a room and discovered a priceless painting. 
</P>
<P>
 The storage business owners have their own stories about the things people 
leave behind. Mary Vincent of Personal Storage Garages in North Hollywood 
recalls that one night a worker heard a pained howl coming from a storeroom. 
Someone had locked a dog inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police have tales about uses for the nearly ideal hiding spaces 
too. They regularly seek warrants to search storage rooms and occasionally find 
what they are seeking: drug labs, pornography, counterfeit money and other 
contraband, said Detective Tom Broad.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the regular storage room gamblers -- the ones who daily scour the 
papers for auction listings, subscribe to resellers' newsletters and carry 
flashlights in their pockets and padlocks on their belts -- say they are 
looking only to come out a little bit ahead. From time to time, antiques 
dealers acknowledge, they do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they're going to find a Faberge egg, but I do think the odds 
are pretty good that they'll find something worth $100," said Terry Kovel, 
co-author of "Kovels' Antiques and Collectibles Price List." "But they have to 
be smart enough to recognize it, that's the key, and then know how to sell it." 
</P>
<P>
 Antiques dealers derisively call the scavengers "pickers," because they are 
willing to sift through the take. The bidders prefer to call themselves 
resellers, treasure hunters or gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
 And they have their own hierarchy. They refer to neophyte pickers as "newbies" 
and hope to drive them out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 See someone who doesn't look familiar? Mutter loudly about a worthless room's 
good-looking haul, run the bidding high, and then dump it on the newbie, 
leaving the newcomer with a roomful of junk. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Hickey Jr. of Canoga Park has only been at the blind auction game for 
about six months. He works nights as a printer and saves many of his days for 
bidding, hauling and reselling storage room contents. 
</P>
<P>
 At 9:30 one recent morning, he was ready to bid on the one unit up for grabs 
at a U-Haul self-storage facility in Whittier. The last payment on the 
10-by-10-foot room had been made in May, the storage manager said, and attempts 
to contact the room's renter had been unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickey and about six other treasure hunters gathered around for the 
auctioneer's usual pre-bidding speech. Cash only. Personal photos and documents 
must be returned. No touching the room's contents. No going inside before the 
bidding. No refunds. No guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
 When the manager opened the door, the gamblers gathered around the door, 
training their lights on the booty: an old sewing machine, a rusty 10-speed 
bicycle, a mattress, and the inevitable, but mysterious, boxes. In hopes that 
the crates would contain items worthy of a swap meet, Hickey made the high bid, 
$350. 
</P>
<P>
 Peeking inside one, he spotted gift wrapping. The others would remain unopened 
until he got home, another tenet of the scavenging game. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what you have, somebody will give you something for it, even if 
it's a nickel or a quarter," Hickey said. "It's only worth what somebody will 
pay for it."

GLUM L.A. TEACHERS GO OVER OFFER BY DISTRICT; LABOR: THE PROPOSAL WOULD RESTORE 
7% OF A 10% PAY CUT. THE MEMBERSHIP APPEARS TO FAVOR MORE BARGAINING RATHER 
THAN A STRIKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On a weekend when Dorothy Phillips had hoped to be writing science lessons for 
her new batch of wily middle-school kids, she instead found herself studying a 
teachers' contract offer, so that if she has to, she can rev up her colleagues 
for a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so depressing to be starting another school year not being able to focus 
on what really matters," Phillips, of Van Nuys Middle School, said Sunday. 
"It's like, boom! All the positive things that we are supposed to be feeling 
right now have been cut off." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, as about 500 teacher representatives like Phillips gathered at 
Hamilton High School on Sunday afternoon to hear United Teachers-Los Angeles 
President Helen Bernstein lash the school district's contract offer point by 
point, most in the auditorium were decidedly pessimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is tiring, this is demoralizing," said Rogelio Lopez of Compton Avenue 
Elementary School. "This is what divides us more than anything else you can put 
in a school system. I don't want to see a strike, because it creates hate 
whether you like it or not. But this is a matter of justice for teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 The districtwide meeting offered the first rank-and-file glimpse of how 
teachers are viewing an offer by the Los Angeles Board of Education to restore 
7% of the 10% pay cut that they have absorbed for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Of that 7%, the board is guaranteeing to refund only 4% indefinitely, and 3% 
is a one-year-only giveback. 
</P>
<P>
 For the union, however, the devil is in the details. 
</P>
<P>
 To get even half of the 4% portion of the restoration, the district's other 
unions must agree to use a pooled $42 million in health benefit savings. 
</P>
<P>
 What the teachers are demanding is 10%, no strings attached, or they strike 
soon after most schools open Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "By a series of specious maneuvers and with the most profound cynicism, the 
district has managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory," said 
Bernstein. "This is a 2% guarantee, a 2% maybe and a 3% one-year only." 
</P>
<P>
 If the strength of the crowd's cheers and jeers was an indication of where 
teachers stand, there was clearly more support for the union to bargain for a 
better offer than there was to strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of teachers are looking at this (negotiating process) as posturing 
right now," Phillips said. "But what we are hoping is that the district will 
come back with something that is acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Several teachers said they would accept a one-year contract with a solid 7% 
restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need something solid. To me, this offer does not count," said Mary Pat 
Kaletsky of Micheltorena Street Elementary School in Silver Lake. "For two 
years I've been living with $300 a month less, but I am expected to do the 
same, if not more work. I personally won't tolerate this anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bev Cook of Bell High School: "I was hoping the district would come in 
with a reasonable offer. Mentally this is very hard on us." 
</P>
<P>
 School Board President Mark Slavkin said Sunday that theirs is "the best offer 
available based on the information available to us." He said they may be open 
to changing their stance after a process of fact-finding, in which an 
arbitrator makes non-binding recommendations to both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 That expert has not yet been chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, "there is not a strategic decision on the part of the board to 
hold back and low-ball this offer to have something to give later." 
</P>
<P>
 The district has identified $162.4 million in surplus funds that the district 
can responsibly afford to fund the 7% restoration, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The union is not advocating program or education cuts to fund salaries. It 
says that another $30.5 million is available if the board is willing to dip 
further into liability and workers' compensation self-insurance funds, and to 
be more liberal in their estimates of future Medi-Cal and lottery 
reimbursements. 
</P>
<P>
 The union also believes that fewer teachers than expected will retire, leaving 
more money from unpaid retirement benefits for salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin said the board's independent accountants have advised that at least 
two of these moves could damage the district's credit ratings. And in addition, 
he said, the contract has to stand up to a tough review from Los Angeles County 
Office of Education auditors. 
</P>
<P>
 But after years of adversarial relations with the school board, the rank and 
file are inclined to believe the union-distributed fact-and-figure sheets that 
they held in their hands Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like (the district) stabbed us in the back and now they are pulling (the 
knife) halfway out and saying that's better," said Curtis Peugh of North Valley 
Occupational Center in Mission Hills.

STREET SMART / HENRY CHU: A HARD ROAD FOR THE DISABLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kay Davenport of Reseda has the routine down pat. 
</P>
<P>
 With a cup of steaming hot coffee in one hand and a telephone in the other, 
she rings up a special city-sponsored dial-a-ride service at 8 a.m. sharp. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost always the line is busy -- even just a few seconds into the workday. 
But as someone in a wheelchair who must rely on such service to unlock the door 
to the outside world, Davenport has no choice but to keep punching the redial 
button until she gets through. 
</P>
<P>
 "Always make sure you go to the bathroom before you start dialing," she says 
only half in jest. "You can't interrupt; you don't dare. If you don't get 
through by 8:30, all the rides are filled up." 
</P>
<P>
 In a region where driving seems as necessary as oxygen, Davenport's problem 
illustrates the plight of those who find it difficult, if not impossible, to 
get into a car, much less navigate one. 
</P>
<P>
 Public transport is often the only alternative, but those who are physically 
disabled have their war stories: of the wheelchair lifts on buses that break 
down constantly, of insensitive bus patrons, of harried bus drivers who, too 
anxious about sticking to schedules, shoot past instead of taking the time 
needed for a disabled passenger to board. 
</P>
<P>
 Such slights can spell the difference between seeing a doctor or missing an 
appointment, getting groceries or going hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Transportation is really basic to people," says Gary Lasdon of the 
Independent Living Center, a Van Nuys-based social service agency for the 
disabled. "If people cannot get around, it takes away their independence." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, it often comes down to the kindness of others, personal ingenuity 
-- or just staying home. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to depend on friends and relatives," says Edna Marie Smith, who has 
been in a wheelchair for eight years because of multiple sclerosis. "And it 
leaves us doing a lot of thinking and maneuvering to get places on our own." 
</P>
<P>
 In Beverly Hills, where she lives, Smith takes advantage of a city-subsidized 
van that shuttles residents to their doctors' offices. But beyond that she's 
stuck, especially if she wants to do anything socially in the evenings or on a 
whim. 
</P>
<P>
 "You read the papers and see the places that they have entertainment, and then 
you have to stop and think, 'Transportation,' " says Smith, who has always 
wanted to go to the Hollywood Bowl. "Usually, if it's after 5 o'clock, forget 
it. Even if the places themselves are accessible, you can't get there." 
</P>
<P>
 But adversity breeds creativity. When Smith went on a recent cruise, she 
ordered a specially equipped van to ferry her to the airport, then had her 
hotel in Miami arrange for an ambulance to take her to the docks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to swallow a lot of silly pride," Smith says, "and just determine to 
do what you gotta do." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles offers a special transportation service for seniors 
and the disabled. In operation since last year, the $27-million Cityride 
program allows participants to buy scrip that can be redeemed for dial-a-ride 
service, cab rides or Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus passes. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, 77,000 people have signed up with the program, which has its 
limitations: Dial-a-ride vans are available only 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays; 
both dial-a-ride and taxi service gobble up scrip quickly, and only the MTA bus 
passes allow you to cross the city line. 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport almost exclusively uses the dial-a-ride service, which must be 
reserved 24 hours in advance to guarantee a ride. Spur-of-the-moment activities 
-- running off to the bank, the post office or the local McDonald's -- mean 
taking a cab, which is costly, or standby dial-a-ride services, which are 
chancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no spontaneity at all. It doesn't work that way for us, believe me," 
she says. "The only time I get to go to a fast-food restaurant for a hamburger 
is when I go shopping in the mall and there's a Burger King in the mall." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some transportation is better than none at all, which Davenport is 
quick to recognize. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has made the difference between living and dying. To that extent, I have 
to emphasize that, despite its shortcomings, it's a wonderful service," she 
says. "It enables me to live an independent life and make as normal a life as 
possible. It's very limiting, but at the same time it opens up the world for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 For the severely disabled, or those for whom even wheelchair-equipped buses 
are inaccessible, there is Metro Access, a countywide, multi-agency effort 
funded by the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 The program provides same-day dial-a-ride service for $1.50 each way, 
regardless of distance and virtually around the clock. About 12,000 people are 
registered with the $18-million program, which averages 900 trips a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Metro Access serves the San Gabriel Valley, East Los Angeles, the 
central city area and a portion of the Westside. The entire county should be 
covered by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnie Brody, who has multiple sclerosis, occasionally uses Metro Access. But 
by living close to City Hall, the aide to Los Angeles Councilman Richard 
Alatorre can commute to work in her wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 Brody, who once tussled with a mugger who threw her to the ground when she 
refused to give up her daily planner, has had five years to adjust to life on 
two wheels -- time in which to learn what services are out there and to engrave 
on her brain a map of L.A.'s bus system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was driving a little T-bird and tooling around town like everyone else," 
she says. "But it's survival now." 
</P>
<P>
 For information on Los Angeles' Cityride program, call 808-7433 from anywhere 
in the 213, 310 or 818 area codes. The countywide Metro Access program can be 
reached toll-free at (800) 827-0829 , or, for TDD, (800) 827-1359.

SLAYING SUSPECT HAD VOWED, 'MY DAYS OF CRIME ARE OVER'; CRIME: ROGER BRADY 
SERVED TIME FOR BANK ROBBERY. NOW HE IS BELIEVED TO HAVE KILLED TWO PEOPLE, 
INCLUDING A MANHATTAN BEACH POLICE OFFICER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When he was awaiting sentencing for bank robberies in 1989, the man known to 
FBI agents as the Clark Kent Bandit sent the judge in the case an apology and a 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would just like to say how sorry I am. . . ," Roger Hoan Brady, now 28, 
wrote in a letter to U.S. District Judge Manuel L. Real. "My days of crime are 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 But if what authorities in Los Angeles County and Oregon allege is true, 
Brady's words proved to be a terrible lie. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady, a child of two cultures, the son of a respected but troubled Vietnamese 
and American family who friends say squandered three years of college in an 
addiction to crack cocaine, is suspected of murdering two people. 
</P>
<P>
 One was 29-year-old Manhattan Beach Police Officer Martin Ganz, a popular, 
about-to-be-married cop shot down in December during a routine traffic stop 
while his 13-year-old nephew looked on. The other was Catalina Correa, a 
55-year-old Portland, Ore., registered nurse who was slain Aug. 3 in what 
Oregon police believe was a coldblooded "witness elimination" killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady has not been charged with Ganz's murder; he is being held without bail 
in Oregon in the Correa case. He has not entered a plea and his attorney 
declined to comment on either case. 
</P>
<P>
 People who knew Brady now wonder if there was any way he might have wound up 
differently. Other people wonder why Brady was walking the streets after 
serving less than three years in prison for bank robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he (Brady) had gotten the sentence he should have gotten the first time, 
Martin and that poor lady would be alive today," said Pamela Ham, 29, Ganz's 
fiancee. "This shouldn't have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Brady was born in 1965 in Hong Kong, friends say, but until age 5 he lived in 
Vietnam with his parents. His father is Philip O. Brady, 55, a former NBC 
television correspondent there. His mother, Diep N. Brady, 52, comes from a 
wealthy Vietnamese family. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1970s the Bradys and their two children, Roger and older sister 
Linda, moved into a house on Observation Drive in the Fernwood section of 
Topanga Canyon, now a kind of millionaires-and-bohemians neighborhood featuring 
winding roads, spectacular views and hillside homes ranging from lavish to 
rustic. Phil Brady worked for a variety of TV news organizations, including 
NBC, CNN and KTTV Channel 11. Phil and Diep Brady declined to be interviewed 
for this article. 
</P>
<P>
 Family friends describe Roger Brady as a bright but extremely quiet, reclusive 
child who never made serious trouble -- his worst childhood offense was 
shooting at birds with a pellet gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "That child was always a loner," said Fernwood neighbor Marguerite Cook. "The 
only people he seemed to feel at home with were his Vietnamese relatives. He 
was of mixed race, and I think it must have been a problem for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Brady also became a young man with a drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a good measure of his life, (Roger) has been quite unhappy and 
dissatisfied with himself," Phil Brady wrote of his son in a 1989 letter to 
Judge Real. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is Amerasian and . . . from his earliest years in Vietnam onward, he was 
subject to a good deal of racial discrimination. . . . He has always been 
inhibited from making friends. . . . He sought to combat the deep personal pain 
he felt . . . first by sniffing glue, later smoking marijuana and finally 
ingesting cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
 In the same letter, Phil Brady described himself as an "overbearing," 
frequently absent father who himself "had bouts with alcohol and drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 According to college records, Roger Brady attended Santa Monica College and 
Loyola-Marymount University for a total of three years. He also worked at a 
variety of sales jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But family friends say Brady fell in with a bad crowd and started smoking 
crack cocaine -- a strongly addictive drug that one drug-counseling expert says 
"makes you hostile, aggressive and feel no fear." 
</P>
<P>
 One afternoon in October, 1989, neighbors saw Brady speeding up the street in 
his yellow Volkswagen, with cops in a patrol car and a helicopter hot on his 
tail. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court documents, the bank robberies had started in August, when a 
young Asian man wearing horn-rimmed glasses as a disguise walked into American 
Savings in Santa Monica, pointed a handgun at a teller and robbed him of $680. 
Because of the glasses, FBI agents who viewed surveillance photographs dubbed 
him the Clark Kent Bandit after Superman's alter ego, the bespectacled 
newspaperman Clark Kent. 
</P>
<P>
 Five more bank robberies followed, a week or two apart, in Los Angeles, 
Calabasas, Woodland Hills, Tarzana and Agoura Hills: The total take was about 
$8,600. But at the Home Federal Savings in Agoura Hills the robbed teller got a 
description of the getaway car; a sheriff's deputy spotted it on the Ventura 
Freeway and chased Brady to his home, where he was arrested with the bank's 
$2,053 in his pocket. An unloaded pellet pistol was found in his car. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady faced up to 25 years in prison for each of the six bank robberies. In a 
plea bargain, he pleaded guilty to two of the robberies and was sentenced by 
Judge Real to 41 months in federal prison, with no restitution ordered. He also 
was given five years of post-release supervision, including drug treatment and 
testing. It was a light -- but not unprecedented -- sentence for a bank robber, 
experts say. Although the pre-sentence report in the case is under seal, 
Brady's lack of a prior criminal record probably was the major factor in the 
short sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady spent time in several federal prisons, and with "good time" credits was 
released from Lompoc federal prison on Oct. 1, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In a post-release letter to Judge Real, Brady wrote, "During my incarceration, 
my drug problem gradually abated. I do not want to revert back to the use of 
controlled substances because I fear it will destroy my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Brady returned to his parents' home. Neighbor Cook said he talked about going 
back to college and for a while worked as a car salesman. In October, 1993, the 
Bradys sold their Topanga house for $315,000 and moved to the Malibu area. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady, as part of his sentence, was required to undergo drug counseling and 
testing after his release. Authorities would not say whether Brady had reverted 
to drug use. But police believe that on the night of Dec. 27, 1993, he was 
violating his parole terms in at least one regard that could have sent him back 
to prison: They say he was driving his father's gray 1988 Daihatsu Charade 
through Manhattan Beach with a .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol in his 
possession when he was pulled over by Martin Ganz. 
</P>
<P>
 Ganz had lived a far different life than the man who allegedly killed him, 
friends say. Born in a Garden Grove family of one son and seven daughters, he 
was active in police Explorers and later became a military policeman in the 
Marine Reserve. He joined the Manhattan Beach police in 1989. An energetic, 
ambitious young man, he loved being a cop, friends say. He also hated drugs, 
serving as the D.A.R.E. anti-drug instructor at several local elementary 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 As Ganz approached the car, the man inside started shooting. Ganz retreated 
behind his patrol car; the man chased him, still shooting. Ganz was killed by a 
gunshot wound to the head. The man then pointed the gun at Ganz's young nephew, 
who was on a "ride along" with his uncle. But the man didn't fire. He drove 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first-ever murder of a cop in Manhattan Beach; the community was 
outraged. A 60-detective multi-agency task force started checking thousands of 
leads, armed with a description of the car and a widely distributed police 
composite sketch of the killer from the nephew and another, unidentified 
witness. One of the earliest leads, police now say, was an anonymous tip about 
Roger Brady. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives interviewed Brady at his Malibu home in January, but had nothing to 
link him to the crime. They did not connect Brady to the Daihatsu involved in 
the Ganz case. A few months later, Brady moved with Phil and Diep Brady to 
Vancouver, Wash., just across the border from Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 3, Oregon police say, a ski-masked robber held up a Safeway store in 
suburban Portland, one of a series of store holdups Brady is suspected of. As 
he left the store, police say, the robber shot and killed Catalina Correa 
because she apparently had seen his getaway car -- a 1988 Daihatsu Charade. 
</P>
<P>
 Another witness, however, chased the getaway car and was shot at three times, 
but got the license number. Police traced it to the Bradys' Vancouver 
apartment. A SWAT team surrounded the apartment, and Phil and Diep Brady came 
out; Roger Brady surrendered shortly thereafter. A .380-caliber handgun and a 
rifle were found in the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady was charged with capital murder in the Portland slaying. Los Angeles 
sheriff's investigators say ballistics tests show the .380 pistol is the same 
gun that killed Ganz. The adult witness in the Ganz case picked Brady out of a 
lineup, police say. Murder charges against Brady in the Ganz case probably will 
be filed later this month, police say.

COMPTON RESIDENTS RALLY TO THEIR OWN DEFENSE; CITIES: EMBITTERED BY WHAT THEY 
CLAIM ARE UNFAIR DEPICTIONS OF THEIR CITY, RESIDENTS HOLD A UNITY MARCH TO SEND 
A DIFFERENT MESSAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In Spanish and English, to the hand-clapping rhythm of gospel music as well as 
the more sedate tempo of a song for Our Lady of Guadalupe, 500 Compton 
residents joined a "unity rally" Sunday to insist that portrayals of their 
community as ethnically divided are unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gather together . . . as a declaration of our determined resolve to live 
together in harmony," said the Rev. Reuben P. Anderson, who as the head of 
Tower of Faith Church, one of Compton's most influential black congregations, 
was one of the rally organizers. "We recognize the ethnic diversity among us . 
. . yet we realize we have more in common that binds us together than issues 
that would divide us." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson and other speakers -- appearing at the rally at a sun-baked Martin 
Luther King Jr. Plaza in the city's civic center -- denounced the media and 
outsiders whom they said had overemphasized tensions between Latinos, who make 
up about half the city's 93,500 residents, and African Americans, who dominate 
city government and school district staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Ongoing efforts to mediate the concerns of the two groups suffered a setback 
earlier this month when a Compton police officer, who is black, was videotaped 
beating a Latino teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, some Latino leaders have called for the resignation of Compton's 
police chief and characterized the incident as an example of the neglect and 
mistreatment of Latinos by the city's African American power structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was hardly mentioned on Sunday, however, as speakers sought to 
shift attention from the city's problems with gangs, drugs, corruption and 
police violence to the positive activities of its largely working-class 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been reported that we have 3,000 gang members," said Leroy W. Grayson, 
president of the Compton Chamber of Commerce. "But there are 97,000 
hard-working, neighborhood-loving people . . . in this community, and this . . 
. is the real Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 "While no one person can reverse negative media coverage of Compton overnight, 
the struggle to tell the rest of the story begins today," Grayson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another speaker, Compton Community College instructor Loretta M. Bailes, said 
"to say that people are not frustrated would be a lie." 
</P>
<P>
 But, she said, "we stand together with a commitment that we can solve our 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Father Clif, pastor of Our Lady of Victory Church, which is predominantly 
Latino, said the churches and other civic groups that organized the event will 
continue working together to address local issues, including affirmative action 
in the city's hiring practices to bring in more Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not denying any of the problems, but there is more good news than bad 
news," he said.

STUNTMAN HURT BY FALL IN KNOTT'S MOCK GUNFIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A veteran stuntman was critically injured in a fall during a show at Knott's 
Berry Farm in what officials said Sunday was the first serious injury to a 
performer in the history of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The stuntman, Jay Mead, 29, was hurt Saturday when he fell 25 feet from a 
structure in a mock gunfight during the 2:30 p.m. performance of the Calico 
Square stunt show, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 He underwent emergency surgery Saturday at UCI Medical Center in Orange and 
remained in critical condition in the intensive care unit Sunday, said Bob 
Ochsner, a Knott's spokesman. Neither Ochsner nor the hospital would describe 
his injuries or confirm reports that he had broken his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Mead, a park employee, was an eight-year veteran of stunt shows at Knott's and 
had performed the fall "hundreds of times," Ochsner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty typical stunt show, and this was just a routine fall," Ochsner 
said. "Stunt work is dangerous, and any fall is somewhat dangerous, but this 
was considered routine." 
</P>
<P>
 During the show's mock gun battle, several of the performers are "shot" and 
fall from structures to a backstage area out of view of the audience, Ochsner 
said. The stunt performers are supposed to fall to a safe landing area, but 
Mead apparently missed that spot and fell to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most likely the accident was not seen by the audience," Ochsner said. "I'm 
only speculating, but no one actually sees them land on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Ochsner said it was the first serious injury to a Knott's Berry Farm performer 
in the "50-year-plus history of stunt shows at the farm." He said that there 
have been minor injuries previously, "but nothing serious until this." 
</P>
<P>
 The Calico Square show was suspended Sunday pending the results of an 
investigation of the incident, Ochsner said.

THE PLEASURE IS THE TREASURE; WITH METAL DETECTOR, SHE FINDS COINS, RINGS --

 Pauline Maxwell gets up with the sun each day to start her search. That's when 
it's cool. That's when it's quiet. And there aren't too many people around to 
block her way. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell, a Rossmoor retiree who has been combing county beaches with a metal 
detector for more than two decades, doesn't know exactly what she's looking 
for. She just loves the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say to me, 'What's the best thing you've ever found?' I'm going to 
repeat what a friend of mine said: 'Peace of mind,' " smiled Maxwell, 64, as 
she passed the $600 device back and forth over the sand near the Newport Pier 
early one morning last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then again, finding a gold ring is nice. Anything gold is nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying a lightweight black-and-yellow wand, with headphones strapped to her 
ears and a belt full of equipment and collection bags around her waist, Maxwell 
is one of hundreds of treasure hunters who dot Southern California beaches 
throughout the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 They are a mysterious lot, toting expensive high-tech equipment to uncover old 
pennies and bent bottle caps. But every once in a while they happen upon 
something special. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Maxwell's comrades at the West Coast Prospectors and Treasure Hunters 
Assn. boasts a $5,000 diamond-and-sapphire ring; another has enough gold bands 
to fill a bracelet-sized key ring. Dozens say they collect as much as $150 a 
month in coins buried under the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell herself won the club's monthly "most unusual" prize last winter when 
she uncovered a set of brass knuckles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows how things get lost, but everybody loses things at the beach," 
Maxwell said. "Nothing ever disappears from the beach. It goes down, and it 
goes out, and it comes back. Nothing really is ever lost. It just gets pushed 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 200 members, the group meets monthly so members can display 
their finds to each other. They publish a monthly magazine, Grub Stake, and as 
part of a national network of prospectors' groups, lobby Congress to keep 
public lands public and beaches clean. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a year, there's a picnic in Mile Square Park with a scavenger hunt for 
specially placed coins. And today is "zero-tide day," a pilgrimage to the coast 
by flocks of prospectors taking advantage of the month's lowest tides to search 
sands usually hidden under water. 
</P>
<P>
 People "think we're nuts, but we're not. It's a hobby like any hobby," Maxwell 
said. "People have to do something," she added, pointing to scores of 
beach-goers nearby enjoying the early morning sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, people are riding bikes. They walk down to the water and collect 
shells." 
</P>
<P>
 On this morning, Maxwell meanders slowly along some truck tracks near the 
water, then moves up to the shade by a row of beachfront homes. So far, she's 
found $1.27 -- including a 50-cent piece -- a mangled paper clip, five bottle 
caps, a fishing sinker, a little red pocket knife, one hoop earring (probably 
not real gold) and a paper-covered twist tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufactured by White's Electronics, in Sweet Home, Oregon, Maxwell's metal 
detector weighs about five pounds. The silver disk at the base contains coils 
that create an electromagnetic field, explained Jeb Smith, a senior technician 
at the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever metal is present, the field is altered, sending a "beep" to Maxwell's 
headphones through the control box strapped on her hip. 
</P>
<P>
 Beeps come every few steps, and Maxwell leans down to the sand with her metal 
scoop. She digs a hole, constantly rechecking with the detector to find the 
exact location of the hidden treasure. She moves some sand, then more. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a Kit-Kat wrapper. Oh, well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a little exciting when you dig . . . and you wonder what it's going 
to be," Maxwell said as she leaned over in response to another beep. "Sometimes 
it's a ring, and sometimes it's the top of a can." 
</P>
<P>
 Once it was a lottery ticket. Lots of times it's matchbox cars or picnic 
utensils or soft drink cans, which she collects and gives to the club to cash 
in for equipment, such as coin cleaners. Last week Maxwell found a German coin 
from the 1950s, and a $5 commemorative coin she almost mistook for a game 
token. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, more than one club member has found a single rose, held up by a metal 
wire, under a dusting of sand. Inevitably, Maxwell said, there's a condom 
wrapper -- with its fine metal coating -- a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really much care (what I find," Maxwell shrugged. "It's just fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Born and raised in San Pedro, Maxwell has lived since 1957 in the Rossmoor 
house where she raised two sons and where her husband died after 40 years of 
marriage. Since retiring a year ago, she spends most of her time gardening, 
redecorating, metal detecting and listening to radio shock-jock Howard Stern. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wake up to him every morning. He makes me laugh. This morning he was 
talking about his mother," she laughs, "and he was talking about a chicken he 
used to own named Pecky." 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell began her endless search for hidden metal goodies at age 43, when a 
doctor told her to walk regularly to relieve blood clots. She began on 
weekends, but now she goes nearly every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at some of my contemporaries who have arthritis and I say, 'What the 
hell's the matter with you? Get out on the beach and walk!' " she said. "I have 
great legs. I have good muscles. I can bend better than most 65-year-olds." 
</P>
<P>
 The fancy detector paid for itself -- in coin, of course -- within a year. 
She's not doing it for the money, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always liked to believe in magic, and this is as close as I've come to 
magic," she said as the detector beeped in her ears. "This thing goes over the 
dirt and finds metal things. That's magical to me."

THUNDER OF GUNFIRE, SPLINTERING OF GLASS; VIOLENCE: MAN RECOUNTS HORROR OF BEST 
FRIEND BEING SHOT IN THE BACK AS THEY HUDDLED FOR SAFETY IN THE FRONT SEAT OF 
CAR. GUNMAN STILL AT LARGE.

 Dan Sapinoso wanted to give his son a big party for his 20th birthday this 
December. Instead, Sapinoso and his wife, Josephine, struggled to get on with 
their life Sunday as they prepared to bury the polite, easygoing young man. 
</P>
<P>
 "My only son -- he's my only son. Everything is meaningless now," Sapinoso 
said. "This will be like a tattoo on my heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Sapinoso was slain in a hail of gunfire Wednesday night as he and his 
closest friend followed a van whose occupants, they believed, were responsible 
for vandalism in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just trying to get a plate number, trying to do the right thing," the 
friend, who asked that his name not be used for fear of reprisal, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the weekend, more than 100 of Robert Sapinoso's friends and 
relatives gathered around a simple gray casket at Forest Lawn in Cypress and 
remembered the young man as generous, bashful and innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a Good Samaritan guy. He just wants to help anybody who needs help," his 
father said. "That's the reason he got killed." 
</P>
<P>
 As police continued searching for two suspects who drove off in the van, the 
20-year-old friend on Sunday recalled the harrowing experience that claimed his 
friend, a computer whiz with a 3.8 grade-point average as an engineering 
student at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 They were tinkering on their cars about 6:45 p.m. Wednesday when they spotted 
a passing silver Toyota van that matched the description of one used by vandals 
in the area the previous weekend. They hopped into Sapinoso's Honda CRX to 
follow the van. 
</P>
<P>
 With Sapinoso at the wheel, his friend said, they managed to get all but one 
digit from the license plate of the van, which pulled over two blocks away. But 
on their way home, as the pair stopped at a traffic light, a passenger emerged 
from the van and strode toward them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The light was red. I told Robert, 'Run it, Robert!' By that time, the guy was 
coming up to the car," according to the friend. "I thought he was going to kick 
the car. Then he pulled a gun from behind his back and started shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 The friend, a college student in Orange County, huddled near the floor of the 
tiny car amid a thunder of gunfire and splintering glass. Sapinoso doubled over 
too, but was blocked by the steering wheel. When the shooting ended moments 
later, the friend was uninjured. He said he called to his buddy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go, 'Robert, are you OK?' I looked at his face and his chest and he looked 
OK. Then . . . his eyes rolled back in his head," the youth recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 When he noticed the wounds in Sapinoso's back, the friend jumped from the car 
and screamed for help, but "there was no one out there or anything," he said, 
deciding it would be quicker to race Sapinoso to a hospital a mile away. He 
wrestled Sapinoso from the driver's seat and, with the shot-up driver's door 
flapping, sped to Vencor Hospital- Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 When they arrived, the youth's cries for help drew a nurse who began 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation. "I was just praying, 'Hold on Robert. Hold on. I 
thought, 'Oh God, this isn't happening,' " the friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 But at 7:16 p.m., Sapinoso was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Police described the suspect as Asian, age 17 to 21. The gunman was 
bucktoothed and acne-scarred, according to the friend, who said, "if I saw him 
again, I'd know it." 
</P>
<P>
 That knowledge scares him. He said he now fears that the gunman might try to 
hunt him or his family down -- especially since he gave police a detailed 
description of the assailant. Police refused to release the composite. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're scared because we don't have any protection," he said. "We're really 
scared."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; PLAN COMMISSION OKS NOISE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission has approved the city's first comprehensive noise 
ordinance, passing the modified rules along to the City Council for final 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 After three hours of discussion and public comment last week, the commission 
rejected a proposal to outlaw gas-powered leaf blowers, but restricted their 
use to between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Use of other property maintenance equipment, such as lawn mowers, would be 
allowed from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. weekdays and Saturdays, and 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
Sundays. Complaints would be handled by police. 
</P>
<P>
 That rule may be modified before the ordinance reaches the council, planner 
Patrick Alford said, in light of testimony from residents living near Big 
Canyon Country Club who complained about early morning noise from green 
maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll probably have to look at that again given the testimony we got. . . . 
It may not be the same when it goes to the City Council," Alford said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also modified rules that would require quieter air 
conditioners, particularly on Balboa and Lido islands, by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners had recommended an exemption from the 55-decibel noise ceiling for 
existing units. But since many units on the islands, where lots are narrow, are 
believed to have been installed without permits or in violation of the existing 
noise limits, the ordinance was changed to allow the exemption only to units 
that were legally installed before the noise ceiling took effect in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Exemptions will be allowed for legally installed units that rate 65 decibels 
at the property line, if the property owner gets written consent from all 
affected property owners. The average automatic dishwasher operates at about 60 
decibels. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council passes the ordinance, it will bring together noise regulations 
that previously were scattered throughout ordinances governing other matters, 
such as public nuisances and construction permits. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plan would classify all properties in the city as residential, 
commercial or industrial and assign acceptable noise limits for each. 
Noise-generating activities in commercial or industrial areas would be expected 
to maintain the lower-level standards of residential areas if the sounds carry 
that far. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the regulations, daytime is 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., nighttime is 10 p.m. to 7 
a.m. HOLLY J. WAGNER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; COUNCIL WILL VOTE AGAIN ON SWAP MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than a month after it rejected plans for an indoor swap meet at a vacant 
industrial building, the City Council agreed last week to reconsider its vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Victor Leipzig, in an unusual move, asked his colleagues to 
reconsider the proposed swap meet. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had voted 4 to 2 at its Aug. 1 meeting to turn down the request by 
Frazer Tremblay, an operator of swap meets in other U.S. cities and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 But Leipzig said his vote against the operation, which was to be housed in a 
212,500-square-foot building at 555 McFadden Ave., was a tough decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a painful vote for me because I hate to say no to a new business," 
Leipzig said. The retail operation was expected to provide the city with tax 
revenue of about $200,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Leipzig said that he didn't vote against the proposal because he didn't like 
the idea. "I was concerned about its impact at the particular site," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project drew opposition because of concerns about the problems that the 
retail business might cause in the industrial neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Some industrial business owners and property owners near the proposed site, as 
well as officials from Huntington Beach Mall, oppose the swap meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Mall officials charged that the project would affect existing retailers and 
cause unfair competition. Opponents also expressed concern about littering, 
vandalism, graffiti and parking problems associated with the swap meet 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Leipzig now believes that "some of these issues can be fully addressed and 
completely resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he plans to meet with Tremblay to try to negotiate some concessions to 
alleviate the swap meet's possible impact on its neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have talked to the operator's representatives, and I think there is room 
for negotiations," he said. He declined to elaborate on the concessions he 
would seek. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to reconsider the proposed swap meet, which the 
planning commission had approved, at a mid-September meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Leipzig said that it might be difficult to persuade his colleagues to change 
their votes. In fact, he conceded, he has yet to change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's every possibility that when it comes back to a rehearing, we get 
exactly the same vote we had before." DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; 9 CANDIDATES IN RACE FOR 2 COUNCIL SEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A mix of familiar faces and political newcomers are vying for two seats on the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 One familiar person is Councilwoman Patricia C. Bates, who is running for 
reelection. Bates, 54, has been on the council since the city's incorporation 
in 1989. The other incumbent, Councilman James F. Krembas, is not running 
again, saying he needs a break from politics. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves room for at least one of eight challengers -- former councilman 
Paul Christiansen, Greg Cox, Harvey Holden, Planning Commissioner Linda 
Lindholm, Mary Ann Malamut, Sandy Miller, former council candidate Eddie Rose, 
and Richard Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 The challengers fall into two groups: those who criticize city government and 
those who say the city is being run well. Rose, a 56-year-old engineer, is the 
most vocal council critic, arguing in two past council bids that the council 
members lack "integrity" and that "cronyism and corruption" should be 
eliminated. Rose led an unsuccessful 1990 recall effort against four council 
members, including Bates. 
</P>
<P>
 Christiansen, 43, who sat on the city's first council, has also aggressively 
questioned city positions. The taxpayer advocate said that as a council member 
he would battle the commercial airport initiative for El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Holden, 71, said he believes Laguna Niguel's council members lack 
enough experience to make the best decisions. Holden, who moved to Laguna 
Niguel less than two years ago and advocates more senior citizen activities, 
was on the Walnut City Council for eight years, including two years as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 After retiring as mayor, Holden was fined $2,000 by the state Fair Political 
Practices Commission for not declaring as a gift $10,000 worth of grading a 
developer did on his property. He said the city attorney told him paying the 
fine was not necessary, but that he decided to volunteer the money to put the 
subject to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, a 52-year-old retired conceptual designer, is active in Laguna Niguel 
youth programs and also led a bitter 1990 petition drive for a ridgeline 
protection ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindholm, Malamut and Miller have not made specific criticisms of the current 
council. All three said they would focus on safety and creating more youth 
activities if elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindholm, 42, is a familiar face from the Planning Commission, where she voted 
to approve a proposed Montessori School in the Beacon Hill area that had raised 
community objections about traffic and safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Malamut is a 35-year-old homemaker who is a delegate in the Marine Hills 
Homeowners Assn. Miller, 53, a mortgage loan consultant, said she favors more 
recreation activities for teen-agers and more city support for local 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The other candidate, 46-year-old Cox, is a small business owner who said he 
would focus on building more athletic fields and fighting against converting 
the El Toro Marine base to a commercial airport. LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; CARD CLUB FOES ENDORSE CANDIDATES 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An organization that successfully battled a proposed card club in the city in 
1993 is endorsing two candidates in the Nov. 8 City Council election. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress Citizens Against Card Clubs announced it is backing Mary Ann Jones, a 
businesswoman, and Tom Carroll, a small business owner and retired business 
executive, for two of the three seats to be filled.Jones and Carroll are 
founding members of Cypress Citizens Against Card Clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-card-club group will not be endorsing a candidate for the third seat, 
said spokesman Tim Keenan. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one incumbent, Councilman Walter K. Bowman, is running for reelection 
this fall. Councilwoman Joyce C. Nicholson chose not to seek a second term, and 
Mayor Richard Partin was barred by term limits from seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress Citizens Against Card Clubs organized in 1993, when a ballot proposal, 
Measure A, called for authorizing a card club at Los Alamitos Race Track. The 
organization helped mobilize opposition to Measure A, and it was defeated in 
the June, 1993, election. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, there is no proposal in the city for reviving the card club issue. 
But Keenan said Cypress Citizens Against Card Clubs members believe the threat 
is always present. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER MOVING SCULPTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Newport Beach City Council tonight will consider spending $1,500 to move a 
huge metal sculpture from the lawn in front of the old Newport Center Library 
to a grassy area on the east side of the intersection of Superior Avenue and 
West Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The hulking sculpture, "Metalphor," by Bret Price, was donated to the city in 
1986 by resident Warren Hancock, a fan of Price's work. 
</P>
<P>
 It sat outside Newport Beach City Hall for part of 1986 and 1987, until it was 
moved to the front of the Newport Center Library. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1991-92 fiscal year, the city negotiated a land swap with the 
Irvine Co. in which the city got the site of the new Central Library and the 
Irvine Co. got the Newport Center property. The Central Library, 1000 Avocado 
Ave., opened July 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating that move, to be completed by month's end, the city's Arts 
Commission set up an ad-hoc task force to choose a new site for the sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the task force's recommendation, the new site beneath a bluff and 
within view of a city parking lot won the approval of the Arts, Library 
Trustees and Parks Beaches and Recreation panels. 
</P>
<P>
 Librarian Tom Johnson said library patrons are so fascinated with the new 
building, they don't appear to have noticed the absence of the sculpture. HOLLY

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city will spend $150,000 in consultant fees to determine what kind of 
computer system it should purchase to lead officials into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 AEF Systems Consulting Inc. of Newport Beach has been hired by the city to 
draft a master plan that will include all city departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The consultants will determine what systems we need and in what order we need 
them," said Vince Whelan, the city's communications director. "It will be a 
complete support system for all departments, from the city manager's office to 
public services to safety systems. . . . It's a really big project." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council hired the consultants at its meeting last week. The sole 
protest was voiced by Sid Soffer, a Costa Mesa resident who thought the 
expenditure would be a waste of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guarantee (the system) will be obsolete by the time you get it in place," 
Soffer said during a public hearing, which preceded the council's vote. He 
suggested the city call up another city, ask officials what kind of computer 
system they have, then purchase that one. 
</P>
<P>
 Whelan said Soffer's suggestion to mimic the computer system of another city 
wouldn't work because each city has different needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has also has been trying to get a new computer system in line for the 
last half-decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it seems like a lot," said Genis before the council's unanimous vote. 
"But if we don't get it in order now, it's going to cost a whole lot more." TOM 
RAGAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: VILLA PARK; OFFICIAL OPTIMISTIC ON FIRE PROTECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Councilman Bob Patchin said he is "cautiously optimistic" about the city's 
chances of getting its share of county tax money for fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The county must agree to return tax money before the city can seek a different 
system of receiving fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is currently served by the Orange County Fire Department, which is 
scheduled to be phased into a Joint Powers Authority this fall, but a Villa 
Park City Council majority opposes the proposed new authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Patchin and Councilman Joseph S. Barsa met with county officials last week 
after the council unanimously authorized such negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We met with (Supervisor) Gaddi Vasquez and (County Administrative Officer) 
Ernie Schneider, and they agreed to have their administrative people look into 
this and get back to us in about two weeks," Patchin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council wants to know if county government will give the city the amount 
of fire-protection money proportionately paid on county property-tax bills by 
Villa Park residents. City officials estimate that Villa Park's share of the 
money is about $635,000. 
</P>
<P>
 If the county agrees to return this money, Patchin said, Villa Park could 
investigate other forms of fire protection, such as contracting with the City 
of Orange Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 At a special council meeting Aug. 10, Patchin and Barsa proposed that Villa 
Park "contract for an initial term of 10 years with the City of Orange for its 
fire and paramedic services in return for Villa park's fire-tax funds." 
</P>
<P>
 Patchin and Barsa also proposed that county government give Villa Park an 
existing Orange County Fire Department building near the city limits. The city 
would then be able to lease that building. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county is prepared to give all (its) fire assets to the (authority); why 
not give to Villa Park those assets in which it has built an equity?" Patchin 
and Barsa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park has been the only city to balk at joining the proposed authority, 
which will be composed of representatives of county government and each of the 
cities now served by the Orange County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park opponents of the authority have charged that it is a vague concept 
and may require cities to impose a tax increase. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; APARTMENT UNITS FOR SENIORS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has tentatively approved zoning changes and an amendment to 
Brea's land-use plan to allow construction of a 108-unit apartment complex for 
senior citizens. The project is proposed for a two-acre site on North Brea 
Boulevard near West Central Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote last week was 4 to 0 in favor of the project. Councilman Burnie 
Dunlap abstained because he is the director of insurance services at Brea 
Community Hospital, which is near the proposed apartment site. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the council members expressed concern that only 84 parking spaces are 
planned for the complex. A survey of senior apartment complexes in the area 
indicated that the amount of parking was adequate, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Final approval of the project is expected to be considered at the next council 
meeting on Sept. 6. ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; DANISH CHURCH TO ERECT NEW BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Karl Olsen moved to California from his native Denmark, he lived first in 
Danish-settled Solvang in the Santa Ynez Mountains, where the familiar sounds, 
sights and scents helped curb his homesickness. 
</P>
<P>
 But after moving to Villa Park in 1966, Olsen turned to his church, Emanuel 
Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church. "The church is important to me because it 
makes me feel like I'm at home," he said. "It keeps that part of my past 
alive." 
</P>
<P>
 The congregation has been meeting since 1906 in downtown Los Angeles buildings 
and currently meets in a rented facility in Pasadena. But this fall, the 
congregation will have a new home on Bastanchury Road in Yorba Linda, a central 
location for their far-flung members. 
</P>
<P>
 The permanent home, officials said, should attract fellow Danes to the church, 
which they say is the only one in their faith from San Diego to Solvang. 
</P>
<P>
 When the new church is finished, it will resemble many of the village churches 
in Denmark, said Ernest Nellerman, a member of the congregation who is the 
general contractor for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The red-tiled roof and white walls are typical of a country village church," 
Nellerman said. "The colors are used because they are found in the Danish flag, 
which is white with a red cross." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gothic-style architecture is also the same as that found in many Danish 
churches, Nellerman said. Outside the east entrance of the church is a replica 
of the Runic Stone, a large inscribed rock that King Harald erected as a 
monument to his father, King Gorm. 
</P>
<P>
 Danes consider Gorm, who died in 958, the forefather of the country's 
Christian monarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stone is significant because it represents the beginning of Christianity 
in Denmark," said Carlo Christensen, a member of the church's executive 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Since members come from all over Southern California, Sunday services are just 
the beginning of an all-day affair. 
</P>
<P>
 "After services we have lunch, then many people stay around to socialize," 
said interim Pastor Richard Baglien. "People come from quite a long distance 
and they don't want leave right away." 
</P>
<P>
 The new facility also will have a cultural center. On the first Sunday of 
every month, visitors can hear services in Danish, then attend a cultural event 
that could include visiting Danish speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Church officials have not yet set a date for a grand opening, but they are 
hoping to have some grand guests, including Denmark's Queen Margrethe, who 
attended the church's 75th anniversary celebration in 1981. DANIELLE A.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; CHURCH WORKSHOP TO DISCUSS PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A lawyer and a Franciscan friar will head a special workshop Saturday to 
discuss the rights of immigrants and the impact that a controversial state 
initiative will have on those rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop, entitled "Immigrants Rights: Steps in Confronting Racism," will 
run from 9 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. at Sts.Simon and Jude Catholic Church in 
Huntington Beach. The event is sponsored by the regional office of the 
Franciscan Friars Social Concerns Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Friar Ed Dunn and lawyer Raoul Aroz will discuss the initiative, Proposition 
187, and lead a public discussion of the measure. Spanish translation will be 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 Event spokeswoman Patricia McCabe points out that Cardinal Roger M. Mahony and 
other religious leaders oppose the so-called "Save Our State" initiative. The 
November ballot measure would bar illegal immigrants from attending public 
schools and from receiving social services and non-emergency public health 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a moral standpoint, it's a bad piece of legislation," McCabe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say that if the initiative passes, protracted legal battles would 
result from conflicts with existing laws. In addition, the measure could put at 
risk as much as $15 billion in federal funds now provided to California for 
health, education and welfare programs, according to the state's nonpartisan 
legislative analyst's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the proposition, including the California Republican Party, 
contend that the legislation is necessary because illegal immigrants are 
creating severely negative fiscal and social impacts in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop will be held at the church's Adult Center, 20444 Magnolia St. 
There will be a potluck lunch and a freewill offering. 
</P>
<P>
 For reservations or more information, call (714) 962-3333 or (714) 960-6237.

 City Clerk Carolyn Morris has disqualified candidacy papers filed by 
businessman Josh McIntosh, leaving five people to vie for the mayor's seat in 
the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris said that of the 26 signatures McIntosh had gathered to nominate him as 
a mayoral candidate, only 12 were certified as valid signatures.Twenty 
registered voters' signatures are necessary to nominate a candidate, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris said she always suggests to prospective candidates that they gather as 
many as 30 signatures to make sure that there is a sufficient number after the 
signatures are verified. 
</P>
<P>
 With McIntosh out of the race, five people, including two incumbent council 
members, are competing for the two-year mayor's term. 
</P>
<P>
 They are Councilman Bruce A. Broadwater, 55, an insurance analyst for the 
state Department of Insurance; Councilman Ho Chung, 60, an insurance agent; 
Kelly Sherwood, 28, an engineering assistant; Al Snook, 59, an insurance 
broker; and former Planning Commissioner Bart Blakesley, 53, an engineer.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; SCHOOL UNIFORMS MAY BE ON THE WAY

<P>
 Students may start wearing uniforms by the middle of the school year under a 
policy being considered school by the Westminster School District Board of 
Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is seeking comments and suggestions on the proposed policy, which 
would allow individual schools to adopt uniforms if parents showed interest in 
having them, said district spokeswoman Audrey Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 She emphasized that under the plan, wearing the uniforms would be strictly 
voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents favor the plan, Brown said, "because they're afraid of gangs and 
discipline problems and (worry about) health and safety. Plus, it's a lot 
simpler to choose school clothes, and uniforms could be a lot cheaper because 
you don't have to pay for the designer stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent survey of parents and staff, 1,073 people said they preferred 
having uniforms as an option while 445 opposed the idea, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board will consider adopting the policy in October. If approved, schools 
could begin surveying parents to determine if they desired the uniforms, Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 To offer comments on the proposed board policy, parents should call their 
local schools. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; CITY TO CONSIDER END TO FREEWAY SIGN BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will consider a proposal Tuesday to overturn a 25-year ban on 
freeway billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 The item was slated for a vote last week but was delayed because of the 
absence of Councilman Frank Feldhaus. 
</P>
<P>
 Regency Outdoor Advertising Inc. has proposed putting up 10 new freeway signs 
in the city. Regency has failed four times in the past 10 years to receive city 
approval for new freeway billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Regency proposal calls for scattering the signs throughout the city, but 
concentrating four signs at the junction of the Orange and Riverside freeways. 
The signs would be up to 60 feet above the roadway and would be up to 950 
square feet and at least 500 feet apart. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for approval, Regency would tear down 13 existing billboards on 
smaller roadways in the city. The removal of the "old and unsightly structures" 
would improve street appearances, said Regency President Brian Kennedy in a 
letter to the City Council last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Planning Department has opposed Regency's plan, arguing the roadway 
signs would diminish freeway appearances and could ruin a $1-million 
landscaping project. The planning staff also said the Regency proposal would 
interfere with efforts to enhance the appeal of the city's resort zones. MARTIN

CHURCH PLANS ORPHANAGE IN RWANDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY DIZON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A church group is setting up one of the first American-sponsored orphanages in 
Rwanda since tribal violence there left tens of thousands of children without 
parents or separated from relatives they may never see again. 
</P>
<P>
 Safe Harbor Ministries, with the Calvary Chapel of Rancho Santa Margarita, 
hopes to open the tent city to accommodate about 3,000 children near the end of 
September, said Bob Krantz, acting director. It would eventually work with 
world relief organizations to get the children adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 "These children, many of whom are under 5, . . . have been left to fend for 
themselves," Krantz said. "We want to take them in and give them some relative 
stability." 
</P>
<P>
 Krantz said he believes this would be the first American-organized orphanage 
for Rwandan children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other organizations have brought in food, water and medical supplies," he 
said. "We're pleased that we have the chance to do something more." 
</P>
<P>
 A three-member Safe Harbor delegation traveled to the Rwanda-Uganda border 
this month. It met with an African Presbyterian mission that had indicated it 
would allow Safe Harbor to set up a makeshift orphanage on a parcel of land 
belonging to the mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Krantz said the deal has been made final, and volunteers from medical 
institutions will go there late next month to set up medical, food and living 
tents for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Safe Harbor is accepting donations from hundreds of churches and social groups 
nationwide and from organizations like World Relief, World Vision and Food for 
the Hungry to raise $240,000 to set up the orphanage, Krantz said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are between 100,000 and 180,000 unaccompanied and traumatized children 
in refugee camps along the Rwandan borders with neighboring countries. A truck 
sent by the United Nations Children's Fund, or UNICEF, travels daily across 
eastern Zaire, collecting the abandoned children. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the month, some 7,400 unaccompanied children had been collected in 
Munigi by relief workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Safe Harbor delegation dispensed medical supplies and baby products. Each 
day the camps and African-run orphanages exceed their capacity, and each day 
more children are brought in or wander in to the camps.

REFORMED CON MAN IS MAKING NEW PITCH; CRIME: JOHN T., WHO VICTIMIZED MANY, 
MAKES AMENDS BY HELPING OTHERS AVOID BEING SCAMMED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS RICCARDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many of the dozen or so people in the basement meeting room of the First 
African Methodist Episcopal Church on Harvard Boulevard are taking notes as the 
speaker begins to dissect "the pitch," line by line: 
</P>
<P>
 The caller informs you that you have won one of four prizes in a sweepstakes. 
You're guaranteed at least a $2,000 shopping spree at the mall of your choice, 
and you could win $40,000. How does it feel to be a winner? All you've got to 
do is buy some products. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stop right there," says the sandy-haired man as two members of the audience 
act out the dialogue. That's the con, the man says. 
</P>
<P>
 He should know. He wrote it. 
</P>
<P>
 He calls himself John T. He was raised in Santa Ana and lives in Seal Beach. 
And he is a former con artist who says he made millions in telemarketing fraud 
before reforming and becoming an anti-fraud expert. These days he goes through 
his old tricks for audiences from San Diego to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 His mission: to educate people -- particularly senior citizens, who are most 
vulnerable to scams -- about how to protect themselves against con artists. His 
motto: "The best way to teach you how to outwit a con artist is to teach you 
how to be one." His warning, verified by a federal fraud investigator: Southern 
California is the No. 1 scam target in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where the money is," says John T. "Plus, people in California are more 
likely to take a risk than someone in Illinois or Ohio," and thus more 
susceptible to get-rich-quick pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 John T.'s visit to First AME, Los Angeles' most prestigious black church, is 
his first stop in the vicinity, but he promises to return. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next time I come back here I want the room filled!" he tells the tiny 
audience. Historically, South-Central Los Angeles has been a particular gold 
mine for fraud artists. Crooks, John T. says, covet the savings of many senior 
citizens who stockpile money to help extended families. As a result, the con 
artist causes more pain: "Proportionally, a (South-Central) retiree who is 
helping to support an extended family who loses $30 is the same as a retiree in 
Laguna Beach losing $10,000." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John T. plays well in churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of his talk deals with his own life: his time on Southland streets as a 
juvenile delinquent; his training and career as what two investigators call one 
of the nation's most notorious con artists, and his conversion in Alcoholics 
Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 His voice takes on a subtle Southern twang as he details his fall and rise, 
his tone softening as he talks about the "good Christian family" that took him 
in, hardening when he refers to the alcohol and drugs that numbed his 
conscience, thundering when he tells his audience: "Now, I don't want you to 
enter another drawing or sweepstakes again, because that's where it all 
starts!" 
</P>
<P>
 John T. says he started in the con business after he left Southern California 
in 1978 at the age of 20 and answered an ad in a Las Vegas newspaper for a 
salesman. Soon, he says, he was one of 50 con artists working out of a "boiler 
room," pulling in what he estimates at $23 million a year for the organization, 
keeping hundreds of thousands of dollars for himself. He says he moved around 
the country, selling counterfeit art in New York City, marketing nonexistent 
oil wells in Miami Beach, and running sweepstakes scams in San Diego, where he 
was ultimately busted in March, 1987, for offering contest "winners" a way 
around having to pay a tax on their soon-to-be-shipped prizes -- buying $400 
worth of promotional items. Postal Inspector David Westberg confirmed the San 
Diego scam's demise. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of his defense, John T. blamed his troubles on alcohol and entered AA. 
He credits his high-priced attorney with getting him a mere 70-day prison 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 While he was incarcerated, John T. realized something. "The woman who said she 
loved me, she didn't visit me," he says. Nor did his con artist friends. "Only 
these people from AA came, and they gave me a Bible, and I read it, and 
something sank in." 
</P>
<P>
 After staying with his AA sponsor in San Diego, John T. moved to Lancaster and 
worked as a chemical dependency counselor, attended UCLA and graduated in 1992 
with a bachelor's degree in psychology. (He had never finished high school.) He 
was also reunited with his family, and says they are now closer than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 His 12-step recovery was still in progress, though, and in 1989 he was stuck 
on Step 9, where one is supposed to make amends with those one has wronged. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can I make amends?" he asked his sponsor. "I don't even know all the 
people I've wronged." 
</P>
<P>
 The sponsor told him to pray. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, John T. got a call from Douglas P. Shadel, a fraud investigator 
with the state of Washington who was trying to start an anti-fraud 
organization. He needed help. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the First AME basement, John T. passes around copies of one of the products 
of his partnership with Shadel -- the book "Schemes & Scams," which they wrote. 
He urges his audience to tell their friends and family about fraud prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you get scammed and stay silent, that means they can scam your family, 
your friends and your neighbors," he says. "If you get scammed and tell 
everyone, you're going to help put them out of business." 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to defend yourself, John T. says. Never buy anything over the phone. 
Never buy anything being sold door to door, and especially beware of 
contractors going door to door offering rebated work. 
</P>
<P>
 John T. hopes the stigma surrounding fraud cases will fade as victims realize 
they are not to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 His eyes are set on the day he can stop crusading and start a normal life -- 
he hopes that by 1996 he will have atoned for what he did and have set up a 
network of anti-fraud workers that will continue while he pursues a doctorate 
in psychology. But for now has amends to make. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no excuse for what I've done," he tells his audience. "That's one of 
the reasons I give these workshops."

YOUTH KILLED IN FREEWAY CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 15-year-old boy was killed in a crash on the Riverside Freeway early Sunday 
after the car in which he was riding was struck from behind by another car, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth was identified as John Dilag of Lawndale, said Senior Deputy Coroner 
Larry Esslinger. 
</P>
<P>
 Dilag and three others in the car driven by a 17-year-old Torrance resident 
were eastbound on the freeway east of Gypsum Canyon Road when the accident 
occurred at 12:39 a.m., said CHP dispatcher Deborah Peake. 
</P>
<P>
 The car in which Dilag was a passenger ran off the road and struck a guardrail 
on the right shoulder, Peake said. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP released no other information on the incident Sunday.

WEATHER HELPS FIREFIGHTERS EXTINGUISH 115-ACRE BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE MARQUIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fast-moving wildfire scorched 115 acres of remote, rough terrain Sunday 
before more than 200 firefighters and a marine layer blowing in from the 
southwest stopped it from spreading. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to get any bigger," said Capt. Dan Young of the Orange County 
Fire Department. He estimated that the blaze would be contained by 8 a.m. 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 No injuries were reported to residents or firefighters and no homes were 
destroyed as of late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Arson investigators were on the scene but no cause had been determined for the 
fire, which broke about 3:25 p.m. near Cook's Corner, at the intersection of 
Live Oak Canyon and Santiago Canyon roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire then spread northeast into the Cleveland National Forest, fanned by 
winds off the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze came to within one-eighth of a mile of a handful of homes in the 
area, but no one was evacuated, Young said. He said engine strike teams were on 
hand Sunday night to protect the neighborhoods, but they were expected to be 
called off soon. Fire crews were going to battle the blaze through the night. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was kept at least a mile from the national forest's Modjeska Canyon 
Nature Preserve, a sanctuary for birds and other wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Access was temporarily restricted on roads in the area, including Santiago 
Canyon and Live Oak Canyon, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire drew 210 firefighters, 40 engines, three hand crews, water tenders, 
bulldozers and water-carrying helicopters. At its peak, the blaze was visible 
for more than 15 miles, according to Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters' efforts initially were hampered by rough terrain and a lack of 
fixed-wing aircraft to battle the fire because they were being used against 
other blazes in Southern California or were still in Northern California, where 
they have been needed during the last three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But helicopters helped to douse the blaze and a cool fog layer was expected to 
blow up from the ocean, Young said.

2 ANAHEIM MEN HELD IN CARJACKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two 18-year-old Anaheim men suspected of carjacking were arrested early Sunday 
after a high-speed chase ended with the driver ramming the stolen car into two 
police cars, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Lopez and Carlos Rodriguez Estrada were booked on suspicion of 
carjacking and assaulting a police officer with a deadly weapon.They were held 
in the Anaheim City Jail in lieu of $50,000 bail each, according to a report by 
Lt. J. Flammini. A third suspect escaped during the carjacking, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The car theft victim, who was unidentified, had stopped his 1984 Oldsmobile 
Cutlass at the intersection of Robin Street and Romneya Drive at 2:54 a.m. when 
a rust-colored Honda Accord with three occupants pulled up next to him, the 
report said. The two passengers, one wielding a handgun, ordered the victim out 
of his Oldsmobile, got into the car and drove off. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oldsmobile was spotted at 3:27 a.m. on Harbor Boulevard by Garden Grove 
police. Officers from Garden Grove and Anaheim chased the suspects at speeds of 
more than 100 m.p.h. on four different freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver finally lost control of the Oldsmobile as he attempted to leave the 
eastbound Riverside Freeway at Tustin Avenue, and the speeding auto rammed into 
two Anaheim police cars. 
</P>
<P>
 No police officers were injured, but Lopez suffered cuts to his face and was 
treated at a local hospital, the report said. LEN HALL

LAWSUIT PLANNED OVER INSURANCE PAYMENTS; REBUILDING: VALLEY-BASED GROUP ACCUSES 
INSURERS AND MORTGAGE LENDERS OF TYING UP REIMBURSEMENT MONEY OWED FOR QUAKE 
DAMAGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL BETTNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Accusing insurance companies and mortgage lenders of tying up millions of 
dollars in damage claims owed to quake-battered homeowners, a San Fernando 
Valley-based consumer group is preparing to take the companies to court. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue -- the same one that embarrassed Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi this spring when he first sided with angry homeowners but then 
reversed himself -- is whether mortgage lenders can legally control how 
insurance payments are spent. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage lenders want quake insurance reimbursement checks made out to them, 
as well as the policyholder, so the companies can refuse to release the funds 
unless homeowners and business operators prove that the money will be spent on 
repairing their property -- which is the company's collateral for its loan. 
Many homeowners, burdened with big quake-related expenses, want the freedom to 
decide themselves what to do with the reimbursement payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving a step closer to legal action, the nonprofit Citizens Against Unfair 
Treatment by Insurance and Mortgage Companies plans to hold a news conference 
today to announce that it is sending letters to dozens of insurers and lenders, 
notifying them they will be named in a lawsuit unless they back down. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit would ask the court to award quake victims who have received the 
dual-payee checks both actual and punitive damages, which would involve large 
sums of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well over 100,000 property owners have gotten these checks," said Richard 
Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. and a director of the 
Citizens Against consumer group, which also includes small-business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Insurance companies say they're eventually going to pay out more than $7 
billion in claims" from January's Northridge temblor, Close said. "If you 
figure even as little as 25% has been paid out so far, we're talking close to 
$2 billion." 
</P>
<P>
 More checks are going out every day, he added, as property owners resolve 
their disputes with insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hoping the Department of Insurance would do something, but they did 
nothing," said Close. "Then we hoped the state Legislature would do something, 
but it did nothing. There's no other alternative but to litigate this issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those speaking at the news conference will be State Sen. Tom Hayden 
(D-Santa Monica), who wrote legislation that would have forbidden insurance 
companies to make checks to quake victims jointly payable to their mortgage 
holders. The bill, which was opposed by the mortgage lending industry, failed 
to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Also speaking will be state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the 
Senate insurance committee and Democratic nominee for insurance commissioner in 
the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 The news conference will be staged in front of the red-tagged home of a 
Northridge couple who are fighting with their mortgage holder, Citicorp, over a 
$120,000 insurance payment from Farmers Group. 
</P>
<P>
 The check can't be cashed without Citicorp's endorsement, and Citicorp won't 
sign unless certain repairs are made, says Howard Simsovits, the couple's son. 
</P>
<P>
 Citicorp told him it would release about a third of the money to get started 
on the repairs "and give us the rest upon completion," Simsovits said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the bank has even threatened foreclosure because the family -- 
which has been renting an apartment since the quake -- hasn't been able to make 
mortgage payments as well as pay the apartment rent. 
</P>
<P>
 If Citicorp released the $120,000 check, "it would be simple to make the 
mortgage current," said Simsovits. 
</P>
<P>
 New York-based Citicorp did not return phone calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said he flip-flopped on the problem of dual-payee checks because he 
feared lenders would challenge him in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he warned, insurers might not make any payments to quake victims at 
all until the issue is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders contend that they need control over quake payments because some people 
whose properties were heavily damaged might run off with the money, leaving 
them with property worth less than the loan they made. 
</P>
<P>
 Furious policyholders contend that lenders have no claim to the money, because 
homeowners bought quake policies on their own initiative, not because it was a 
condition of the loan -- as is the case with fire insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurers say they are caught in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we know about a mortgagor's interest in a property, we're obligated by law 
to protect that interest," said John Millen, a spokesman for Farmers Group, the 
state's largest insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, he added, "The Department of Insurance has not asserted that 
insurance companies naming mortgagees (on checks) are in any way acting 
improperly." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners who have sent their checks to banks and mortgage companies to have 
them co-signed have complained that the process takes weeks, especially if 
their lender's headquarters is out of state.

SOLID SUPPORT; COMMUNITY GROUP BRINGS POLICE DIVISION INTO THE COMPUTER AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a decade into the computer age, many Los Angeles police officers 
still hammer out homicide reports on battered, archaic typewriters, suffering 
the indignities of hitting the "K" key and getting a comma, maybe, or the comma 
key when they want a five-space indentation. 
</P>
<P>
 But not at the Devonshire Division in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 There, there are computers on nearly every desk, as well as top-of-the-line 
laser printers and a $3,000 telephone system that dials neighbors when a 
break-in occurs down their street. 
</P>
<P>
 Devonshire officers who finish duty at 3 a.m. and have to be back in court a 
few hours later no longer shiver in jail cells or on a storage room floor -- 
they curl up in Art Deco bunk beds with black and burgundy comforters. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder visiting officers point excitedly around the division and blurt 
things like "Check this out!" 
</P>
<P>
 "People call this place 'The Club,' " said Devonshire Senior Lead Officer Rick 
Gibby. And Devonshire officers call a 44-year-old Granada Hills mother, wife 
and dental office manager when they remember the old days and want to say 
thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 In two years, Becky Lohnes Leveque and her group SOLID (Supporters Of Law 
enforcement In Devonshire) have helped make the division probably the most 
technologically advanced in the city, according to LAPD spokesman Officer Ray 
Sua. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the 60 or so computers -- "You may have one per whole division" 
in other parts of the city, Sua said -- there are cellular telephones, a 
paper-shredder, answering machines and night-vision goggles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're asking (police) to risk their lives for us," Leveque said. "The 
question people should ask themselves is: 'How can we help?' " 
</P>
<P>
 It's a question the energetic mother of three admits she didn't often consider 
until late 1990, when a burglar smashed her dining room window and made off 
with her 16-year-old son's precious collection of baseball cards. 
</P>
<P>
 She was furious. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I thought: 'You have a full-time job. You have three kids. What can you 
do?' " 
</P>
<P>
 By the next spring the same son had encountered prowlers at the house and a 
neighbor's home had been burglarized. Leveque decided she had to do something. 
</P>
<P>
 She organized a community meeting on police issues, delivering invitations 
door-to-door. She expected a couple dozen families to show; 500 came instead. 
</P>
<P>
 As Leveque began rallying her neighbors and forming the coalition that would 
eventually become SOLID, she began meeting with officials at the Devonshire 
Division and seeing how antiquated their equipment was. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people assume that every division is computerized," she said. "That's 
how it is in the movies." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the six senior lead officers at Devonshire -- in charge of community 
policing programs -- shared one phone and one desk. The first one in each 
morning got them both. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers would cannibalize one typewriter to keep another in service. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was ridiculous," Leveque said. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, SOLID was sending out fliers that listed equipment the division needed. 
People would donate $5 or $10 or offer an old desk or file cabinet. One man 
rounded up some 40 personal computers when his company upgraded its system. 
Another donated $3,000 worth of sand for graffiti removal. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, SOLID joined the six senior lead officers as they worked to 
implement community policing programs mandated -- but not funded -- by the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 After just over two years of organizing, there are upward of 11,000 people 
involved in Neighborhood Watch, volunteer surveillance and graffiti-removal 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of SOLID also wash the bedding from the bunk room and pay the 
division's cellular phone bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's effect has been not only to equip us with things we need, but to further 
connect the police with the community," said Devonshire Capt. Vance Proctor. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not an attitude change in the west Valley that has helped SOLID grow from 
an angry brainstorm to one of the most effective police support organizations 
in Southern California, Leveque said. The anger and frustration with mindless 
violence were well-entrenched by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 What was missing was a framework that allowed a working wife and mother of 
three -- and 11,000 other people -- to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't need bigwigs," Leveque said. "Take it to the people."

MAN FOUND DEAD AFTER SHOTS FIRED AT BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 19-year-old man was found early Sunday lying in a street with a gunshot to 
the head just minutes after he and other men fled from a shootout at a local 
bar, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead man was identified as Candelario Quiroz Sosa of Pacoima.Quiroz Sosa 
had been one of the occupants of a van that had been driven away from the Maeba 
Bar in the 13500 block of Van Nuys Boulevard in Pacoima, said Police Sgt. 
Michelle Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers responded to a call at the bar about 12:15 a.m., and were later 
informed that a van that left the bar was found in San Fernando, Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 15 minutes after the incident, a San Fernando police officer found 
Quiroz Sosa's body and the van on Truman Avenue near the intersection of Brand 
Boulevard when the officer responded to a resident's report of an apparent 
hit-and-run accident, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police arrived at the scene and took over the investigation, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sosa was taken by ambulance to a local hospital where he died, Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, police were trying to unravel the crime to determine whether Sosa 
and the men he was with were involved in the shooting at the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a shooting at the bar, yes, but we don't know yet if they are 
suspects or witnesses," said one detective working on the case.

5 TEEN-AGERS SHOT ON FREEWAY; CRIME: VICTIMS WERE ATTACKED FROM A CAR THAT 
PULLED ALONGSIDE THEIR VEHICLE EARLY SUNDAY MORNING. NONE WAS SERIOUSLY 
WOUNDED, AND POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING.

<P>
 Five San Diego teen-agers were injured, but none seriously, in an early 
morning shooting Sunday on the Hollywood Freeway near Universal City, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests have been made in the 3:50 a.m. incident, which occurred between 
Lankershim Boulevard and Barham Boulevard.Police said it was possibly 
gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said one 17-year-old sustained gunshot wounds to the chest or abdomen 
but was treated at a local hospital and released. All of the victims, males 
between the ages of 17 and 19, were hit at least once, police said, but some 
were just grazed. All were treated at local hospitals and released. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police reports, the five teen-agers were traveling south on the 
Hollywood Freeway in a red sports car when a white Toyota pulled up alongside 
and the gunshots began. 
</P>
<P>
 After being shot, the victims got out of the car and scattered on the freeway 
attempting to flag down cars, police said. Police said there were no witnesses 
to the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said between seven and 10 shots were fired from the Toyota while the 
two cars were traveling alongside each other at about 55 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you've got bullets flying around you, it's hard to count," said Sgt. 
Roger Dardarian of the North Hollywood Division of the Los Angeles Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they don't know whether each victim was hit by a different bullet 
or whether several victims were grazed by the same one. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, the victims saw five men in their early to mid-20s in the 
other car but were not able to get a license plate number. Police have not 
located the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the victims ate at a Thai restaurant in North Hollywood before the 
shooting and may have had a dispute with the suspects there.

MAN FACES MANSLAUGHTER CHARGE IN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Mission Hills man who was driving with a suspended license from a previous 
drunk driving arrest was booked on suspicion of manslaughter after his vehicle 
crashed into another car, killing a 42-year-old Sylmar man, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Lopez, 33, of Mission Hills was arrested and booked into the Van Nuys 
Jail on Saturday after failing a sobriety test at the scene of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police reports, Lopez was traveling northbound on Woodman Avenue 
about 6:15 p.m. Saturday and allegedly failed to stop for the stop sign at the 
intersection of San Jose Street. Police said his vehicle slammed into a car 
that was being driven westbound on San Jose by John Pasillas, 42, of Sylmar, 
who died on impact. A passenger who was in his car is in stable condition at 
Holy Cross Medical Center, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness saw Lopez's pickup truck speeding toward the intersection before the 
accident, according to police. Police said Lopez failed a field sobriety test 
and a sample of his blood was taken for analysis. Police said they also found 
beer in his car. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police reports, Lopez was uncooperative when police tried to 
arrest him. 
</P>

ARREST IN LEWD PHOTOS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A 30-year-old Canoga Park woman made a citizen's arrest of a man she said used 
a hand-held mirror and camera to photograph underneath her dress while she 
browsed in a store in the Topanga Plaza Mall, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Chavarria, 29, was booked on suspicion of lewd behavior and is being held 
in lieu of $250 bail, according to Sgt. Dan Mastro of the West Valley Division 
of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Mastro said the woman, who was not identified, pointed out Chavarria to police 
about 8 p.m. Saturday after he allegedly bent down and used a small mirror to 
reflect her underwear and then took a picture of the image with a 35-millimeter 
camera. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who was informed of the man's action by a bystander, called police. 
She and the bystander then followed Chavarria as he entered another store and 
photographed a second woman, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police cannot arrest a suspect for a misdemeanor they did not witness, so the 
woman made a citizen's arrest by asking police to arrest Chavarria for his 
behavior. "He was just leaning down and sticking (the mirror) between their 
legs," Mastro said. "These people are bent over, looking at things, shopping, 
and he slides in behind them." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Mastro said, the division has handled reports of video cameras 
being used for lewd conduct, but never a mirror and camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very unusual," he said. "This is the first time I've heard of it in 18 
years."

PROPOSED GOLDEN STATE OFF-RAMP STIRS DEBATE; BURBANK: CITY SAYS INTERCHANGE IS 
NEEDED TO REVITALIZE REDEVELOPMENT SITE, BUT CRITICS CONTEND THAT THE AIM IS TO 
HELP LOCKHEED SELL UNUSED LAND. 
</P>

<P>
 A proposal to build a $23-million interchange on the Golden State Freeway pits 
some Burbank council members, who say it is needed to deal with traffic 
congestion, against critics who charge it would provide a financial boost for 
the Lockheed Corp., which contributed to their election campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed and the council members deny there is any link between the donations 
and the interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 City administrators say the proposed Empire Avenue interchange would help 
revitalize the huge Golden State Redevelopment Area -- a dormant section that 
once was home to many manufacturing firms. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics contend the project's aim is to help Lockheed sell a 103-acre 
parcel that has gone unused for three years, and they fear Mayor Bill Wiggins 
and Councilmen Robert Bowne and George Battey Jr. will cast the three votes 
needed to pass it. 
</P>
<P>
 In informal discussion at a council meeting June 21, Bowne and Wiggins 
indicated that they might support building the off-ramp. Battey, who recently 
returned to his council duties after a long illness, was absent from those 
discussions and has not yet voiced an opinion, but critics say he frequently 
votes with them to form a controlling bloc on the five-member council. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lockheed has donated to those three, and I firmly believe that this is a 
pay-back," said Jim Gordon, co-founder of the Burbank Flat Landers Home 
Protection League and a 56-year resident. "If it's good for Lockheed and the 
property they want to develop, they should pay their appropriate share. But the 
city wants the good citizens of Burbank to pay for it all." 
</P>
<P>
 According to their campaign finance records, Bowne and Battey received $1,000 
each from Lockheed during their 1991 campaigns, as did Wiggins in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The off-ramp is the second-most expensive capital-improvement project listed 
in the city's 1994-95 budget. The capital projects -- included on what is 
essentially a wish list -- must be debated individually by the council before 
construction can proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although conceptual drawings have been made, the off-ramp plan has not yet 
been been placed on the council's agenda. City administrators, however, said 
the council did set aside $2.3 million to hire engineers to design the project, 
though none of that money has been spent yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Unusual for most such projects, the city has not yet asked Caltrans, the state 
agency that pays for most freeway work, to share the cost, potentially leaving 
the bill entirely to Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Susan Spanos and David Golonski -- neither of whom received 
money from Lockheed in their 1993 election campaigns -- have expressed vehement 
opposition to the off-ramp proposal, expressing the same objections as the 
homeowner group. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a special-interest off-ramp," Spanos said. "From what I understand, 
it would exclusively benefit the Lockheed land and the (Burbank) airport, and I 
have a problem with considering a huge expenditure for such a limited benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lockheed land, a triangular-shaped parcel bounded by Empire Avenue, 
Vanowen Street and Victory Place, was acquired by the company in the 1920s and 
used for a huge military aircraft manufacturing plant during World War II. The 
site remained a major facility until the company moved most of its 
manufacturing jobs to Palmdale and Georgia in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, all that remains is a dirt field. Lockheed executives say they want to 
sell the land to a developer who would build a "retail power center" on the 
site, with one or more large stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has courted several developers in recent years, but so far no 
deals have been struck. Wal-Mart looked into buying the site but lost interest, 
possibly because of the lack of freeway access, city officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Keith Mordoff, a Lockheed spokesman, said last week that the company has 
"absolutely not" asked council members to build a freeway interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, we did contribute to some of the campaigns. Before the last local 
election some of our officials met with all the candidates to discuss their 
views," Mordoff said, adding that the company was looking to support 
"pro-business candidates." 
</P>
<P>
 "But the issue about an overpass never came up, and since the election, 
Lockheed has never had any meetings with the candidates it supported. So I 
think it's unfair to say these people are considering the off-ramp because we 
gave them a campaign contribution." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Wiggins also rejected any suggestion of a pay-back, and accused critics 
of blowing the issue "way out of proportion." 
</P>
<P>
 "The folks that are upset about this are saying that it's imminent, but I 
quite frankly think it's far from imminent," he said. He also said the off-ramp 
may take a back seat to other capital improvements, such as parks, libraries 
and other facilities. If Lockheed cannot find a developer for the property, 
that would delay the need for the off-ramp, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, the development of that land is on the back burner as far as 
Lockheed is concerned. And if it's on their back burner, it's on my back 
burner," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mordoff, however, said Lockheed is "very close" to reaching agreement with a 
builder to make use of the land, but he would not say how soon a deal could be 
expected or what kind of deal it would be. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank administrators insist the Empire Avenue interchange was proposed not 
by Lockheed nor a developer, but by city planners. About two years ago, the 
city hired consultants to determine how to reduce congestion at the heavily 
used "five-points intersection" at Victory and Burbank boulevards, as well as 
in the Golden State project area. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Helvey, Burbank's assistant city manager, said several options were 
studied, including improvements to the Golden State Freeway interchanges at 
Buena Vista Street and Hollywood Way, but a new off-ramp at Empire Avenue "had 
the most promise." 
</P>
<P>
 He said critics assailing the City Council for pursuing the project are 
jumping the gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Depending on your point of view, you can argue that it is or isn't being done 
to help Lockheed. From our position, our motive is to improve traffic flow and 
the vitality of the area," Helvey said. "As for the city deciding to pay for 
it, that may in fact be what we do, but we're just not that far along in the 
process yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Kramer, a painting contractor who ran unsuccessfully for the council in 
1993, said the city should not consider building the off-ramp without demanding 
that Lockheed, Burbank Airport and Caltrans contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's too many other needs in Burbank. The schools are falling apart, the 
sidewalks need fixing. You can't just spend $23 million on an off-ramp," Kramer 
said. "If some developer wants an off-ramp, let them pay for it. It's not an 
appropriate use of the taxpayers' money." 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer compared Lockheed's situation to that of Universal Studios, which in 
1986 sought and won approval from Caltrans to spend $3 million to build on- and 
off-ramps from the Hollywood Freeway to its hilltop theme park in Universal 
City. But Helvey said it would be "highly unusual" for the city to ask Lockheed 
to contribute to the project, because the city's position is that the off-ramp 
is for the city's benefit, not the company's. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Wiggins agreed that a cost-sharing arrangement may be the only way the 
project will win approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's going to benefit Lockheed and it's going to benefit the airport, I 
think they should contribute handsomely to it," Wiggins said. But he said no 
discussions have taken place either with the developer or the airport 
administration. The airport is run by an authority established by the cities of 
Glendale, Burbank and Pasadena and managed by a Lockheed subsidiary, under 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council approves the off-ramp project as a city expense, Kramer 
predicted a voter backlash in March, when the seats held by Bowne and Battey 
will be up for election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they underestimated the outcry from the Burbank citizens," Kramer 
said. "Not one person has come out in favor of this."

VALLEY CHRONICLE: IT'S NOT A SHELL GAME: TURTLEMANIA GRIPS RESEDA HOUSEHOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To the sugar addicted, turtles are nut clusters decorated with caramel and 
chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 To kids, turtle is the family name of a cartoon guy, whose first name is 
mutant ninja. 
</P>
<P>
 To Betty Alice Kinder of Reseda, turtles are family. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to raising two sons, a dog, two cats, some rabbits and a guinea 
pig, she is also den mother to a bale of turtles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's see," says the "Turtle Woman of Reseda," We have several California 
desert tortoises, a Texas tortoise, several hybrid Texas and California guys, 
three box turtles and three red-eared sliders. Most of them were given to me." 
</P>
<P>
 She says her fascination with turtles comes from her mother, who got her first 
turtle at the time the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was building 
the spillway in Castaic for the Los Angeles Aqueduct that would bring water to 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother's father, Sam Arthur, was paymaster on that project when one of the 
workmen found a motherless baby turtle. My grandfather brought it home to my 
mother, who named it Petie," she says. She eventually passed the turtle, and 
her love of turtles, along to me. 
</P>
<P>
 Turtles are perfect pets because they don't chew up shoes, cause noise 
pollution or try to dine out on the neighborhood mail carrier, Kinder contends. 
</P>
<P>
 They can, and will, however, make a meal of any garden flower you happen to 
prize, she warns. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinder also has found they can nonplus your friends and neighbors. One 
particular instance with a particularly large tortoise leaps to Kinder's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once, I was out on the patio with my woman's church group. We were all 
sitting around in a circle with our heads bowed in prayer. Our minister's wife, 
a fine and proper lady, had just finished giving a blessing when she opened her 
eyes and looked into the face of Big Mama. Her 'amen' sounded more like 
ameeEEEEEEK," Kinder says. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinder admits getting her husband, who once suffered from turtle appreciation 
deprivation, hooked on the reptiles, though it took a while. But she has always 
had a way of getting Robert Kinder to change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Van Nuys High School graduates met cute, as they say about movie 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 There were two mothers who looked alike and both shopped at a Hughes market in 
Van Nuys in the late '50s, where the 18-year-old Kinder worked as a box boy. 
The two mothers were amazingly similar. Their two teen-age daughters were not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was your typical blonde, beach-bunny babe and the other girl was a sultry 
brunette type," Kinder remembers. "He asked my mom if she thought I would go to 
the zoo with him that day, thinking my mom was the mom of the sultry brunette." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Kinder did finally get to take out the sultry one; but he ended up 
marrying the perky blonde at the Sherman Oaks Church of the Chimes three years 
after their first date. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert grew to like turtles in proportion to the size of the herd growing in 
his back yard. He is now president of the San Fernando Valley branch of the 
California Turtle & Tortoise Club, which meets in Canoga Park monthly. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife still presides over the family horde of creatures in the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lived in this same house in Reseda for more than 30 years and we've 
always had a yard full of kids, turtles and other animals," Kinder says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kinders say they have been given almost all of their animals by friends or 
people who couldn't keep them, or didn't know how, adding that their 
understanding of turtle needs has come from an adult lifetime of conferring 
with vets, trial and error, and information they've picked up by networking 
with other turtle shelterers in this country and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Alice Kinder says that although tortoises get eaten by wild animals or 
pecked to death by ravens when left in their natural environment, it is man who 
is their worst enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like to go out to the desert and use wild desert turtles for target 
practice. Some go off the road trying to kill them with their cars. You wonder 
who would want to kill one of these lovely, nonaggressive creatures. What kind 
of lives can these people have?" she asks. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, turtles live to be a lot older than humans do, and as for 
survival techniques, we humans could learn a thing or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, Kinder says, she was having some work done around the house and Pinkie, 
who is probably 50 years old, was sealed up under the house for several months 
until he was discovered by a spa repairman. "We had searched everywhere, 
including under the house for him and couldn't find him," Kinder says. "When we 
did, we were amazed he was still alive." 
</P>
<P>
 She says she spent weeks babying him, carrying him around and trying to get 
him rehydrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Old Pinkie made a miraculous recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Pinkie is once again roaming the back yard of the Kinder home in Reseda, 
scarfing all her prized roses. She says she doesn't care. Donor Found in 
Glendale But No One Wants Transplant 
</P>
<P>
 Have you heard the one about the town that wanted to be an organ donor, but 
couldn't find anyone who wanted a transplant? 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately this is not a joke, at least not to the people at the Glendale 
Redevelopment Agency who have been trying to find a new home for a Wurlitzer 
organ that they can't get rid of. 
</P>
<P>
 The organ, built for a San Francisco theater, was bought for a private 
Southern California mansion in the early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowner died and the home was turned into a museum with the Wurlitzer 
still inside. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the good citizens of La Canada Flintridge heard about this organ -- 
which is bigger than a bread truck and has pipes that are taller than a 
four-story building -- the good citizens said no organ performances, Not In My 
Back Yard. 
</P>
<P>
 So, the La Canada Flintridge City Council sold it to the City of Glendale, 
where the preservation-conscious Glendale Redevelopment Agency thought to 
install the organ in the city's restored Alex Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Only problem, according to the agency's Kirk Pelser, was that the organ 
wouldn't fit into the building. "The only way we could have gotten it in the 
theater is to have permanently removed all the theater seats," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale, which has spent many thousands of dollars having the thing 
dismantled, crated, stored and what-have-you, now is not sure just what to do 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jeanne Armstrong, the agency's director, the city has spent many 
hours trying to find a home for the grand old musical lady, who can even 
produce the clomp, clomp, clomp sound of horses' hoofs. 
</P>
<P>
 So, if you are looking for a spectacular item for your club or organization's 
blind auction, does the city of Glendale have a bargain for you. Overheard

HOSPITAL LOOKS FOR A WINNING NAME; HEALTH: MEDICAL CENTER'S CONTEST IS PART OF 
AN EFFORT TO REVITALIZE ITS IMAGE. MORE THAN 300 ENTRIES, MANY IN JEST, WERE 
SUBMITTED, WITH TRIP TO HAWAII THE GRAND PRIZE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A contest to rename Palmdale's only hospital has produced more than 300 
entries, including some that say the center should pay tribute to the area's 
distinctive vegetation or its aerospace pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
 One entrant, however, believes the hospital should honor a celebrity whose 
ties to the Antelope Valley are unclear -- unless he's living locally under an 
assumed name. If that's the case, should Palmdale become the home of "Elvis 
Presley Memorial Hospital"? 
</P>
<P>
 That suggestion and a few other entries, such as "A Stitch in Time Medical 
Center," were apparently submitted in jest. But administrators at Palmdale 
Hospital Medical Center insist that their efforts to remake the facility and 
give it a new name are dead serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "Palmdale Hospital has basically been in, I guess 'turmoil' would be a good 
way to put it, for the past several years," said Carol Fryer, its public 
relations director. "This will be a way of letting the community know we're 
committed to the community and want them to have a first-class hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital, which opened as the 49-bed Swam Memorial Hospital in 1965, grew 
to become Palmdale General Hospital, then the 123-bed Palmdale Hospital Medical 
Center. The hospital's future became uncertain, however, when its last owner, 
Affiliated Medical Enterprises, went bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palmdale facility was purchased last year by Paracelsus Healthcare Corp., 
which also owns nearby Lancaster Community Hospital. Since the purchase, 
Paracelsus has cut the staffing and converted some double rooms to singles, 
reducing the number of hospital beds to 97. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fryer said the company also has done extensive remodeling and is promoting 
specialized services such as an alternative birthing center and a mental health 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 In conjunction with this, the hospital announced a contest last month to 
propose a new name. Employees were eligible to enter, but most suggestions came 
from the public, Fryer said. The winner will receive a weeklong trip for two to 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 341 entries received were several references to the local landscape, 
including "Joshua Tree Community Hospital" and "Desert Breeze Community 
Hospital." The person who proposed "Neil Armstrong Medical Center," preferred 
to emphasize the region's aerospace history. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, a seven-member committee from the hospital staff will trim the entries 
to five finalists. Corporate officials will then make the final choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost a sure bet to lose is "San Andreas Community Hospital," a reference to 
the earthquake fault near Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Fryer pointed out that earthquakes "are a fact of life in California. But I 
don't think you'd want to highlight it."

DRIVER ARRESTED IN DEATH OF PEDESTRIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles man who told sheriff's deputies that he fell asleep behind the 
wheel on Sunday struck and killed a 69-year-old man who was walking on the dirt 
shoulder of the road, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, a Quartz Hill resident who remains unidentified pending 
notification of family, was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident, said 
Lt. Daniel Castillo of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Herman St. Aimie, 28, was driving west on Avenue K when he struck the victim, 
who was walking east about 8 a.m., authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aimie, who was headed to the state prison at Lancaster, told investigators he 
fell asleep in the car and, when he awoke, exited the car and walked to a 
nearby house where he tried to contact friends before getting a ride to the 
prison, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on his statement, I can only assume that he did not know he had struck 
anyone," Castillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors who had earlier assisted Aimie discovered the victim's body and 
contacted deputies at the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station, who located Aimie 
at the prison, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aimie was taken into custody at the sheriff's station and booked on suspicion 
of vehicular manslaughter.

A BIG MATH ATTACK; JAN DAVIDSON TURNED A LIFELONG PASSION FOR TEACHING INTO A 
MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR SOFTWARE CORPORATION. BUT SHE HASN'T LET HER NEW LIFE AS A 
SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSWOMAN DRAW HER AWAY FROM HER TRUE LOVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twelve years ago, Jan Davidson was exactly where she wanted to be -- in a 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 She had known since age 13 -- when she began tutoring other children after 
school -- that she wanted to teach. 
</P>
<P>
 Her home life was on track as well. Davidson and her husband, Bob, were 
raising three preteen children in Palos Verdes. His career as a corporate 
executive was on a meteoric climb. 
</P>
<P>
 But Davidson had a vision that would forever alter their lives: Why not use a 
home computer to teach kids math?  
</P>
<P>
 It's not a radical notion today, but at the time only a handful of educational 
software programs were available, and almost none of them were widely used. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were dull and if a kid missed something they would make this horrible 
'beep,' " Davidson says with disdain. "Here you had this powerful tool for 
teaching and all you were giving a kid was negative feedback every time they 
hit the wrong key. And it was loud enough that everyone in the room knew that 
Johnny had made a boo-boo."

 Davidson's computer experience was limited to an Apple II -- woefully 
primitive by today's standards -- purchased in the late 1970s. But she believed 
that if educational software could be as exciting as computer games, she might 
use it to good advantage in the classrooms where she ran an after-school 
tutoring service. 
</P>
<P>
 She sat down at her Apple with a friend who knew a bit about programming and 
created a game for grade-school students called "Math Blaster." 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you got an answer right, you'd shoot a man out of a cannon," 
Davidson explains. Kids loved Math Blaster. Their parents wanted to buy copies 
to run on home computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no 'beep.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson began selling the software through her tutoring service, and later 
via a catalogue distributed by Apple. 
</P>
<P>
 Her kids -- Elizabeth, now 23, Emilie, 20, and John, 18 -- were her first 
workers. When an order came in, they used her computer to copy the discs. Their 
mom used an unwieldy shrink-wrap machine ("I hated that thing," she says) to 
give the little packages a finished look. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson, 50, still sells "Math Blaster." But instead of asking her kids to do 
the work, she now has a team of employees -- about 500 in all. They work in a 
sleek, modern building -- with her name across the top -- in a Torrance 
industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Davidson & Associates racked up almost $60 million in sales. The 
original "Math Blaster" and its update have sold 1.6 million copies, making it 
the world's second most successful educational software title -- behind "Carmen 
Sandiego." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice that I got rich," Davidson says. "But honestly, it wasn't my main 
objective. All I wanted to do was to teach kids." 
</P>
<P>
 If she is daunted by the events of the last 12 years, she hides it well. 
Dressed in a plain red jacket and simple gold necklace -- more parent-teacher 
night than corporate executive -- she speaks almost shyly about her financial 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 Erin Yoshida comes into the office to set up a software demonstration. 
Davidson rushes over to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are wonderful!" the boss says. "I have not given you your hug yet." 
</P>
<P>
 She embraces a beaming Yoshida. It is not a David Viscot-style, touchy-feely 
'90s hug, but a sincere appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoshida, 25, coordinated the recent release of "Multimedia Workshop," a 
program that allows kids -- and adults, for that matter -- to create 
presentations incorporating photographs, drawings, text and even video. 
</P>
<P>
 "She got that program through testing and out the door," Davidson says with 
pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to have people here who are not savvy computer users to work on our 
manuals and programs," she adds, "because those of us who use them all the time 
might be jaded. Someone outside of the business would be more reflective of the 
average consumer." 
</P>
<P>
 Yoshida leaves the sparsely furnished office and Davidson returns to the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to always think of education as something you did with kids," Davidson 
says. "Now I realize you learn all your life. I get a lot of satisfaction out 
of watching people grow. I think I enjoy building the people as much as I do 
doing the products." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Davidson grew up in Frankfort, Ind., a town that claims it gave birth to the 
hot dog. Her father distributed dairy products to grocery stores. Davidson, the 
oldest of three children, was a star student, but she did take time out for 
Indiana's overriding passion -- high school basketball games.  
</P>
<P>
 "Of course I went to the games," she says, incredulous that anyone would even 
have to ask. "It's what you did in Indiana." 
</P>
<P>
 What kids didn't do is read heady tomes on educational theories. "Even then I 
was reading these books on pedagogy by John Dewey," she says. "I was always 
fascinated by education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I often get the question now, 'Would you have done something different if you 
were growing up today?' And I really don't think I would have." 
</P>
<P>
 She attended Purdue University "because it was not far from home." Her first 
weekend there, she met Bob Davidson; they married after she got her bachelor's 
degree in 1966. (She later earned a master's in communications and a doctorate 
in American literature, and taught at the community college level, while 
continuing to tutor.) 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next 10 years, the couple moved three times -- and each of those 
times, she was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we got to California in 1976, I said to Bob, 'No more moves and no more 
babies.' " They settled into a home in Palos Verdes where they still live. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever they lived, Davidson tutored at home, a couple of students at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are working one on one, that's when you can actually see the moment 
the kid gets it," she says, clapping her hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would work to get those moments." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In the wake of Proposition 13, the 1979 tax-cutting measure that caused such a 
panic that some school administrators decided to end the school day at noon, 
Davidson founded Upward Bound. She headquartered her nonprofit tutoring service 
in a leased classroom at a Palos Verdes elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It mushroomed right away," Davidson says. "People didn't know what to do with 
their kids all afternoon, and they were afraid that they would slip behind in 
schoolwork." 
</P>
<P>
 To keep up with the demand, she hired teachers to oversee courses ranging from 
SAT preparatory seminars to remedial math. Upward Bound started out as a 
service for high school students, but as it grew in popularity, Davidson added 
classes for second-graders all the way up to adults. At its peak, during the 
1983-84 school year, about 3,000 students took at least one class at Upward 
Bound. 
</P>
<P>
 At about the time she launched Upward Bound, Davidson bought her Apple II, 
thinking it could be used to replace the numerous machines used in a speed 
reading course. On a computer, she figured, the same exercises could be 
customized to the individual students. 
</P>
<P>
 She needed a program for the course and that need begat "Speed Reader." Next 
came "Word Attack" for vocabulary, and then "Math Blaster." 
</P>
<P>
 When orders came in, the household would go into a disk duplication and 
shrink-wrap frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, while cleaning the room of her son, John, she came upon a business 
card he had made for himself about 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wrote in his little handwriting, 'John Davidson -- Best Disk Duplicator in 
the World.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson smiles and shakes her head. "He really was a good disk duplicator. I 
took the card and put it in his baby book." 
</P>
<P>
 The day the first order for 100 programs arrived, she turned over production 
to a professional. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, a year after Apple picked up the programs, the company went out of 
the mail-order business. Davidson thought this would be a good time for her to 
get out of the software business. She decided to turn her venture over to a 
software publisher so she could get on with her tutoring and simply collect 
royalties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob was very successful in his career, he was working long hours and 
traveling a lot," she says. "I already had enough on my plate." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Davidson, who was executive vice president of the Parsons international 
engineering and construction firm in Pasadena, believed that his wife would be 
miserable with the fate of her programs in another's hands. But her mind was 
set, and the couple scheduled a meeting with a San Diego-based publisher.  
</P>
<P>
 The publisher never showed, and Bob took the opportunity to hammer home his 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said I would never be happy turning over these programs to someone who 
didn't care or know as much about education as me," Jan recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 On the drive home, she finally acquiesced. 
</P>
<P>
 They later learned that the publisher had not stood them up. He was waiting at 
a different location. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Davidson waves to the receptionists at the front desk of Davidson & Associates 
and heads out the door. She walks at a fast clip, heading for an office four 
blocks away where the company has rented additional space. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing low heels, she takes shortcuts across lawns of other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always plan a little too much to do in the day," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson & Associates went public in 1993, after a series of buyout offers. 
One came just a couple years after Davidson started the company -- using $6,000 
from savings set aside for her children's college education ("You can imagine 
what it did to me to take out that money," she says). 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they wanted to pay $2 million," she says. "Bob was really floored." 
</P>
<P>
 But Davidson would not entertain offers. 
</P>
<P>
 As other companies realized that there was big money to be made in the 
educational software market, Davidson & Associates got a lot of big-name 
competition. CBS, for example, announced that it was jumping on the bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think CBS and others tended to look down and say, 'Who is this little 
schoolteacher out there making a couple of products?' " Bob Davidson says. 
"They should have never underestimated her." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest difference between the competition and Davidson, industry 
observers say, is her passion for education. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of companies back then that had the view that they were in 
the software business," says Phil Adam, co-founder of the computer game company 
Spectrum Holobyte. "Jan considered that she was in the education business, and 
that made all the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Or as Ken Walsh, president of the Software Publishers Assn., puts it: "Jan 
didn't just know her customers, she was the customer." 
</P>
<P>
 After introducing more than 50 educational products, CBS pulled out of the 
business after just a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson & Associates is now producing new products at a faster clip than CBS 
did. But all products have to meet Jan Davidson's standards for what a student 
and/or teacher would truly like and need. It makes for long hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob and I kind of made a decision early on that what we would be willing to 
give up in our lives was an active social life," she says. "That wasn't so hard 
for me, because I get so much more satisfaction out of my work and my family 
than I do anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 "I spend so little time at home," Jan says, "I'm very jealous of that time. If 
I want to see a movie, we'll wait for it to be on video." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Davidson, 51, left Parsons in 1989 to join Davidson & Associates as its 
CEO. He looks after all the operations and financial aspects of the company, 
freeing Jan to oversee research and development of the products. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving at the leased office space, Jan sits down to get a quick 
demonstration of a new software product, in progress, developed by an outside 
group for the Davidson label. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, wow!" she says, clearly impressed by the opening title screen of the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's downhill from there. "I'm not sure about the design," she says to the 
project manager, a longtime Davidson employee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the composition is very weak." 
</P>
<P>
 She quickly pulls other employees and even a visiting photographer over to the 
computer to get their opinions. Several times, she assures the project manager 
that her critical remarks might be premature. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I'm overreacting to what they have done," Davidson says, but it's clear 
that everyone in the room is carefully weighing her reactions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to say I'm disappointed," she says, finally. "I'm sorry I could not be 
more positive." 
</P>
<P>
 On the way back to the office, Davidson walks quickly, but this time she is 
mostly quiet. "That one is scary," she says. The product is not coming along as 
she had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes outside contractors provide the company with a welcome dose of new 
creativity. Sometimes not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to go back to the office and check the contracts," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson may be known in the business as the schoolteacher who made good in 
the business world. "But no one," Bob Davidson notes, "should underestimate her 
business sense." 
</P>
<P>
 She has said in several recent speeches that technology, correctly applied, 
could help transform the embattled education system in this country. "As I 
visit schools throughout the country and talk with educators, I sense that our 
schools are preparing kids for a workplace that no longer exists," she said in 
the keynote address before the National Educational Computing Conference last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of our schools are still set up to teach kids how to work in an 
Industrial Age. But the world these kids are going to face is an Information 
Age." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, she fully expects that Davidson & Associates will be a leader, if 
not the leader in putting multimedia educational products in the schools and 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Davidson, the most satisfactory experiences in education are still one 
on one. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a place where you can make mistakes," she says, addressing a group of 
30 new employees in a motel conference room across the street from company 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Although almost all these new hires are in their 20s or 30s, they are a varied 
lot, from dressed-for-success business-affairs types to T-shirt-wearing 
warehouse workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson works the room like a classroom, wandering among the attentive new 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a place where you should make lots of mistakes," she continues. "I 
used to have a sign in my schoolroom that said, 'If you don't make 10 mistakes 
a day, you aren't trying hard enough.' 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want you to be afraid to take a risk. Of course, we generally don't 
like it if you make the same mistake over and over again." 
</P>
<P>
 The employees laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the way you learn is by making mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that," she tells them. "I'm a teacher." Jan Davidson

 Benefits -- A box accompanying an article about middle-aged couples who live 
together (Life & Style, Aug. 15) misstated the impact of marriage on Social 
Security benefits. An individual's monthly benefit, which is based on lifetime 
earnings, usually remains the same in the event of marriage, says a 
representative of the Social Security Administration in San Francisco. 
Supplemental Security Income, a federal program based on need for individuals 
65 or older or disabled, usually decreases in the event of marriage.
