PUTTING THAT MTV GUY TO DEATH; DENIS LEARY STILL HAS THE BITE THAT CEMENTED HIS 
ANTSY PERSONA, FROM 'NO CURE FOR CANCER' TO HIS CINDY CRAWFORD RAVINGS. BUT 
WITH 'THE REF,' HE'S SET HIS SIGHTS HIGHER. IS AMERICA READY FOR DENIS LEARY, 
MOVIE STAR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WALKER, Michael Walker is a free-lance writer based in Los Angeles.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can smoke in the bar at the Hotel Nikko Beverly Hills, but almost nobody 
does. Except Denis Leary. That's him, slouching in a black-leather sofa over in 
the shadows, firing up another cigarette, ordering a platter of shrimp, the guy 
with the fine Irish features and drunken-altar-boy roll to his shoulders who, 
in this dim light, looks astonishingly like Bryan Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 Leary would hate the comparison. To his way of thinking, high-rotation rock 
stars like Adams and R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe should be rounded up and 
euthanized. In "No Cure for Cancer," Leary's breakthrough 1990 one-man show, 
the writer, actor and comedian seethed: "See that scar on my wrist? Know what 
that's from? I heard the Bee Gees were getting back together." Smoke and spit 
flying, Leary added: "We live in a country where John Lennon takes six bullets 
in the chest and Yoko Ono -- who's standing right next to him -- doesn't get 
one ? Stevie Ray Vaughan is dead and we can't get Jon Bon Jovi into a 
helicopter? Do we need a two-hour movie about the Doors? No, I can sum it up in 
five seconds: I'm drunk, I'm nobody; I'm drunk, I'm famous; I'm drunk, I'm 
dead." 
</P>
<P>
 "No Cure for Cancer," which Leary assembled while marooned in England after 
his wife, Ann Lembeck, went into premature labor there, created a sensation Off 
Broadway in 1991. The show spawned a book, a cable-TV special, an album for A&M 
Records and, indirectly, a series of 60-second spots for MTV in which Leary 
smoked, paced and raved about everything from Rodney G. King to Cindy Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, almost inevitably, the 36-year-old Leary, thwarted hockey player, former 
acting teacher, part-time house painter and reluctant stand-up comedian, the 
son of blue-collar Irish-American parents from Worcester, Mass., wants to 
establish himself in mainstream movies. It's a career path strewn -- literally 
-- with the bodies of comedian-cum-actors who went before him. For every Chevy 
Chase and Robin Williams, there's a John Belushi or a Sam Kinison -- 
fire-breathing comics in Leary's mold suffocated by Hollywood's commercial 
expectations. Even Eric Bogosian and Spalding Gray, theatrically grounded 
performance artists like Leary whose effortless irony and intelligence he 
approaches, have yet to make films that match the magnetism of their stage 
personae. 
</P>
<P>
 Leary, nevertheless, is trying, even if his film resume thus far is almost 
direct-to-video. He co-starred with Emilio Estevez in "Judgment Night," turned 
up in "The Sandlot" and "Demolition Man" and, earlier this year, in "Gunmen," a 
movie his publicists won't even list on his credits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes "The Ref," Leary's first starring vehicle, with its first-class cast 
(Judy Davis, Kevin Spacey), big-time executive producers (Jerry Bruckheimer and 
Don Simpson) and big-time expectations. With no bankable stars and a freshman 
director (Leary's close friend, Ted Demme, who directed the MTV spots), the 
movie, which opens Wednesday, rests squarely on Leary's shoulders.  
</P>
<P>
 Playing a cat burglar who takes hostage a bickering couple (Davis and Spacey), 
Leary delivers a variation on his suffer-no-fools MTV persona much the way 
Robin Williams riffed his way through "Good Morning, Vietnam." Although the 
role plays to Leary's comic strengths, it also brings him to the brink of 
type-casting. "The Ref" could be his breakthrough but it could also be a trap, 
and Leary knows it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having come from outside of films and wanting to get in, and knowing that 
that (MTV guy) image existed, I was concerned, because I didn't want to get 
stuck with it," he explains in his raspy Boston brogue, cigarette smoldering in 
the ashtray. "I also understand the reason you get cast in something is that 
they want what they've seen. Strangely enough, ('Ref' screenwriter) Richard 
LaGravenese was a guy I went to Emerson College (in Boston) with back in '78 
and never heard from again. He had written the script without thinking about me 
at all, but there was an element to the character that was recognizable as what 
people consider the MTV guy, which is why, quite frankly, they made the movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Theoretically, "The Ref" is the bridge that will take Leary, who appeared in 
productions at the Boston Shakespeare Company after graduating from Emerson in 
1979, to meatier, more serious roles. Leary cites Steve Martin, who deftly 
jettisoned his arrow-through-the-head "wild and crazy guy" and eventually 
became accepted as a credible actor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It becomes a matter of your attention span," he continues. "Doing the same 
character over and over, it gets boring. You end up like LeRoy Neiman. I mean, 
how many goddamn golf events can you go to and paint?" 
</P>
<P>
 "My gut feeling about Denis is, he can act," says Doug Herzog, MTV's senior 
vice president of programming, who attended Emerson with Leary. "He's obviously 
a comedian, but at the end of the day, he's an actor." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Michael Gruber, one of Leary's agents: "It's a weird Catch-22. Everybody 
who wants to be in business with Denis now are the people who wouldn't meet him 
two years ago, because he wasn't, in their eyes, an actor. Denis was always 
willing to prove he could act, but there are times that people just won't open 
their doors, especially to people coming out of the stand-up world. But look at 
Tom Hanks, Robin Williams -- nobody wanted to see them in a drama five years 
ago, and look at them now." 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, Disney has already green lighted the next Leary vehicle, "Two If 
by Sea," a comedy Leary wrote with writing partner Michael Armstrong. Also on 
deck is "Noose," a drama -- "funny, but in a very dark way" -- written by Leary 
and Armstrong with Leary's wife, Ann, supplying the story. Meanwhile, as Leary 
sinks ever deeper into Hollywood, the notes for his next one-man show, "Birth, 
School, Work, Death," molder in journals back in his apartment on New York's 
Upper West Side. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm actually looking forward to getting back to it -- it's almost a year now 
since I've been onstage," he says. "Bogosian just opened his new show in New 
York. I haven't seen that yet, but I know when I do I'm gonna come out juiced 
up and wanting to get back onstage." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leary has, one way or another, always been onstage. The younger of two sons in 
a family that included a pair of daughters, he quickly sized up his chances and 
became the pop-off kid. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother was a wild man," Leary recalls. "He was a very funny guy, but he 
was quieter than I was, and, generally speaking, there's never two wise-asses. 
Thinking back on it, I got away with a lot of stuff because my brother was so 
big. You could say something to somebody, and they'd want to hit you, but they 
couldn't because there was always this really big guy standing a couple of feet 
away who they knew was your brother." 
</P>
<P>
 Leary remembers his father, an Irish immigrant, as a devoted parent, if 
somewhat emotionally reserved. In "No Cure for Cancer," he recalled how during 
his brother's 10th birthday party, his father calmly walked in from the living 
room, where he had been cutting paneling with a circular saw, his thumb nearly 
severed. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'm thinking, 'Wow, Dad's thumb is hanging off. He's probably gonna start 
crying any second now.' And this is what my father says: 'We got any tape 
around here? I need to tape this baby up.' He wouldn't let my mother drive him 
to the hospital. That was too much a threat to his masculinity -- to be seen in 
a car driven by a woman. So he taped up his thumb with black electrical tape 
and drove himself to the hospital. I looked at my brother and said, 'Hey pal, 
forget about crying. We're never going to be able to cry about anything, ever. 
Our authority figure is a man who could cut his head off with a chain saw, and 
he'd staple-gun it back on.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad was very much a John Wayne kind of guy," says Leary, "but he was also 
a great guy, great sense of humor, a real dedicated dad. I don't think he ever 
missed a hockey game I was in. Actually, I hope I raise my kids" -- a young son 
and daughter -- "the way my parents raised me, because they did a pretty good 
job. The most important thing, which we thought was normal, was that they were 
married for, God, 35 or 40 years. (Leary's father died in 1985 while visiting 
family in Ireland, two days after his 60th birthday.) We just assumed all 
families were like that. They scream and yell and grab food and fight at the 
table, but you don't lose anybody. Some people are in the penalty box, but 
they're always there. I think a lot of the problems people have are based on 
their parents walking away from their responsibilities, which is the easiest 
way out." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruminating on the recent Olympic soap opera, Leary says: "Tonya Harding's 
mother is married eight times. There's a picture of her mother in some magazine 
in a fur coat with a bird on her shoulder. I looked at that picture and that to 
me summed the whole thing up: Every time you come home there's a different dad 
and the same bird, y'know?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At 17, Leary was ensconced in parochial high school, tabulating his limited 
options. "I wasn't the best student," he admits. "I wasn't stupid, but I wasn't 
paying a lot of attention. By then, I knew I wasn't going to play professional 
sports because I just wasn't good enough. I knew I wanted to write or act. I'm 
really happy I went to a Catholic school because a lot of the repressive 
tactics they use make for great senses of humor. You're always laughing your 
ass off when you're not supposed to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Leary left the family home in Worcester and enrolled at Emerson, studying 
acting, where he met Steven Wright and a clutch of other young comics who would 
soon burst out of Boston onto the national scene. Leary, though, was the big 
man on campus. "What I remember about Denis, at Emerson, was that he was like a 
celebrity," says MTV's Herzog, "just enough arrogance to make it work." 
</P>
<P>
 After graduation, Leary returned to Emerson to teach comedy writing and 
improvisation. "It was just 10 of us in a room going over work, so it wasn't 
really like I was teaching . . . but for two hours every third day, you had a 
place where you could go even though you were driving a pizza delivery truck or 
working in a chemical plant, and it would just be all about this creative 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he was breaking into Boston's comedy scene in his own bullheaded 
fashion. Rather than submit completely to the vicissitudes of the clubs, he 
booked his own room and presented stand-up, sketches and song parodies. "When 
you're a young comic, you're lucky to get on once every two weeks," says Paul 
Barclay, owner of Boston's Comedy Connection, who booked Leary early on. "If 
you have your own space, you're it. Every Saturday night, he could do his own 
show." 
</P>
<P>
 Stand-up, in any event, was problematic, because Leary refused to edit his 
scatology-heavy material. "It was hard to get him work," says Barclay. "He'd 
play a middle-age crowd the same as a college crowd. He was good, funny, but he 
decided, no matter what, not to compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 Leary finally moved to New York, working the downtown clubs where he could let 
his material roam as far afield from standards of decorum as he pleased. In 
March, 1990, he flew to London with his pregnant wife to appear on the BBC 
television show "Paramount City." The show was scheduled for Saturday night; on 
Saturday morning, Denis and Ann's son, Jack, was born 12 weeks prematurely. 
With a wife and son conscripted by doctors not to leave England for five 
months, Leary stumbled into an invitation to present a one-man show at the 
Edinburgh International Arts Festival. The show, "No Cure for Cancer," was a 
hit, moved to London's West End, and then to New York, where Ted Demme, then 
the director of "Yo! MTV Raps," caught it and had an epiphany. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything he said was something I was feeling or wanted to say," recalls 
Demme. "I called him the next day and said, 'You may or may not know who I am, 
but I need to talk to you.' " Over burgers, Demme told Leary, "Listen, I think 
we could do something funny." Two weeks later, they were shooting Leary's first 
pace-and-smoke spots for MTV. For good or ill, the MTV guy was born. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the Nikko's bar, Leary is smoking his umpteenth cigarette, marveling 
at the calibrations of his favorite writers. (Leary himself writes an 
occasional column for Details magazine -- "a totally low-maintenance writer," 
says his editor, Joe Dolce. "His great skill is poking fun at everybody and not 
insulting anybody -- he's angry, but not mean-spirited.")  
</P>
<P>
 There's Ian Frazier's New Yorker piece about Wyle E. Coyote suing the Acme 
company -- "I had to stop, like, five times to laugh out loud, which you almost 
never do when you're reading." There's Albert Brooks -- "He's one of those 
guys, I own all his movies, I can pop in a scene for the 40th time and just die 
laughing." 
</P>
<P>
 Leary's taste is telling, and speaks well of the sturdiness of his own 
writing. Unlike many young comics, he knows the difference between jokes and 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could never write a joke," Leary declares. "I can't tell a joke. I can tell 
stories. Where I grew up, it was always funny stories -- the Irish thing, very 
oral. Humor always came out of the funny things that this guy did, or the funny 
thing that happened to this character. Jokes are great, they're terrific -- 
Steve Wright's jokes are almost abstract, like haiku. But humor, the real deep 
laugh, comes from reality and character and situation.  
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that made 'The Honeymooners,' which to me is like American 
Shakespeare, wasn't the jokes. It was the situation and the people. Same with 
the Seinfeld show and Albert Brooks: There are memorable lines, quotable tracts 
of dialogue, but it all comes from the situation.' 
</P>
<P>
 It's one reason Leary never cared much for stand-up. "I eventually realized I 
ended writing ('No Cure') because I was frustrated and I knew I was never going 
to hit these zanies and funny bones," he says. "Which was fine, because 
everybody I knew who was doing stand-up was coming back like a Vietnam vet. My 
friends had these horror stories -- you're stuck in a comedy condo with some 
juggler in Ohio after the show, and there's nothing to do and you're trying to 
just watch TV and go to sleep, and the juggler is like, 'Hey man! Watch this!' 
And he's juggling oranges, and you're part of his act. I'd be in a prison right 
now in Ohio. Guys would be going, 'I killed my parents and chopped up my wife. 
What did you do?' And I'd say, 'I lit this juggler on fire a week ago in a 
comedy club.' 
</P>
<P>
 Leary stubs out his last cigarette. "I can't," he says, with some gravity, 
"live in a comedy condo. Y'know?"

EXPATRIATE GAMES; FED UP WITH HOLLYWOOD, OSCAR-WINNING SCREENWRITER STIRLING 
SILLIPHANT MOVED TO THAILAND TO ESCAPE THE POSTURING AND POWER PLAYS. BUT THE 
VERY THINGS HE FLED FOLLOWED HIM THERE WHEN HE WROTE A MOVIE FOR TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, Daniel Cerone is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stirling Silliphant, a fixture in the entertainment industry for three 
decades, disappeared from Hollywood six years ago. He was one of the industry's 
most prolific screenwriters, winning an Academy Award for 1967's "In the Heat 
of the Night," the racial thriller starring Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the service of profit-hungry studio executives, he also churned out 
lots of commercial action films -- from the so-called blaxploitation movie 
"Shaft in Africa" to director Sam Peckinpah's violent "The Killer Elite" -- and 
campy Irwin Allen disaster epics such as "The Poseidon Adventure" and "The 
Towering Inferno." 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, Silliphant grew tired of the power plays, the egos, the 
hypocrisy and the dictum that homage must be paid to the box office. In 1987, a 
dispute with Sylvester Stallone over screen credit for the championship 
arm-wrestling saga "Over the Top" finally pushed Silliphant himself over the 
top. He sold two houses, six cars and a yacht and moved to his favorite 
vacation spot, Thailand, where the culture and Buddhism held a fascination for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't come here on a fling but to change my whole existence, my 
personality, my understanding of life, and to leave what I call the eel pit of 
Hollywood behind," the graying expatriate said last spring, sitting in a Trader 
Vic's here on the bank of the massive Chao Phraya River and gazing outward at 
the low-slung boats and barges passing by. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it feels so good to be part of the human stream, and not some Hollywood 
big shot who worries about what table he gets at Jimmy's and won't let the 
parking attendant touch his $80,000 Mercedes. That seems so far away now. 
That's not the way we're supposed to live." 
</P>
<P>
 In Thailand, where the American dollar is strong, the people are gracious and 
the land is largely unspoiled, Silliphant had a vision. Using local crew and 
talent, he wanted to turn Bangkok, along with the rest of Southeast Asia, into 
a burgeoning production center for English-language TV projects and feature 
films that would be distributed internationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Little did he suspect that with his first effort, the problems he associated 
with working in Hollywood would track him down, 8,271 miles away: A star, Fred 
Dryer, got involved, rewrote the script and, in Silliphant's view, ruined his 
vision. The resulting TV movie, "Day of Reckoning," airs Monday at 9 p.m. on 
NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen a video of the final version," Silliphant, 76, said in another 
interview last week. "I do not like it. My distaste stems not from whether the 
work is good, bad or indifferent. The critics and viewers will soon enough make 
their own decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is simply that it is not the film I envisioned, the film about which I 
felt a driving passion and a long-held visionary hope -- finally to capture 
something, even a hint, of what it is like to be an American expatriate living 
in Thailand. The final result, to me, is a film assembled by committee, a 
script hammered flat by executive fiat." 
</P>
<P>
 Dryer disagrees. The action-filled NBC series "Hunter" turned the onetime Los 
Angeles Ram into a star with worldwide clout after it was syndicated in 90 or 
so countries, becoming the most-watched TV program in China at one point. The 
changes Dryer made in "Day of Reckoning" were to give his fans what he believes 
they expect in his first acting assignment since "Hunter" ended production 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The project couldn't have turned out better," he said of "Day of Reckoning," 
in a recent telephone interview from Colorado while on vacation with his 
daughter. "We think we have a real good piece." 
</P>
<P>
 "Day of Reckoning," produced as a potential TV-movie franchise for NBC, tells 
the tale of an American Special Forces captain who moves to Bangkok after the 
Vietnam War. He becomes a Buddhist and a rogue travel guide, specializing in 
expeditions to remote and dangerous locations in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Silliphant and his Los Angeles partner, actor Robert Ginty, spent a year 
trying to raise $1.5 million to produce "Day of Reckoning" themselves. But the 
two farongs , or foreigners, couldn't entice Thai investors. Ginty was going to 
star as Jack O'Brien, the lead character, but wasn't a big enough name. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more significant, the once-buzzing film industry has grown anemic in 
Thailand, where a big-budget movie might cost $400,000, compared to $25 million 
or more for an American film. Flashy products from Hollywood and nearby Hong 
Kong have almost killed the industry, keeping smaller, local Thai productions 
out of the few theater chains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most Thai investors would still rather fill a swamp and put up buildings than 
back a film," said Silliphant, who began writing in the late 1950s on such 
acclaimed TV series as the police drama "Naked City" and the road show "Route 
66." 
</P>
<P>
 So Ginty took the project to Paramount in Hollywood. As Silliphant tells it, 
Ginty signed the rights away before Silliphant could object. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The next thing I knew, it had gone from Paramount to Fred Dryer to NBC, and 
suddenly we had a deal," Silliphant said last spring when "Day of Reckoning" 
was still in production. As Silliphant sat sipping his tropical drink in Trader 
Vic's, filming was taking place several hundred yards away in the luxurious 
lobby of the Royal Garden Riverside hotel. He was available for consultation, 
but he was so disheartened that he wouldn't appear on the set. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I heard this, I was not only unhappy, I was very upset," Silliphant 
continued. "And what I knew would happen has happened. Number one, the budget 
went from $1.5 to $4 million. And number two, we totally lost control of the 
project. We sold the house. And then it went into the Hollywood system. What is 
the Hollywood system? The Hollywood system is to come to a place like this and 
just use it as a background." 
</P>
<P>
 He gestured out the hotel window to the Chao Phraya -- a busy waterway of 
commerce and trade in Bangkok and the best way to avoid the snarling traffic 
jams that transform stifling city streets into a virtual parking lot during the 
day. Along the exotic green shores, beautiful resort hotels stand between 
rotting, wooden dwellings where naked children play in dirty water. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's not what I intended," Silliphant said. "What we're getting is 
money. Period. We're not getting what we set out to do -- which is to control 
the film, to invest it with the culture and the attitudes of Thailand, to make 
an essentially Thai-produced film. I felt a sense of great personal failure, 
having said 'Screw off' five years ago, 'I don't need you bastards.' Here I was 
back selling them something, and it was a total denial of everything I wanted 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Silliphant said he bears no resentment toward Ginty, who ended up with a 
supporting role in "Day of Reckoning" as Dryer's partner in his travel 
business, Eco Tours. Ginty said he was simply fed up with shopping the movie 
around when he made the deal with Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen this development process go on for years, having worked in 
independent films," Ginty said. "But you've got to get it made. You can talk 
about it forever. There are guys out there in Morton's who are constantly 
talking about it, and guys in Spago constantly talking about it. I got 
impatient. I wasn't going to wait any longer, because I knew it would sell. 
Between Stirling's name and this location, I knew the story would sell." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Early last year, the plans Dryer carefully devised for his career were 
collapsing like a house of cards. When "Hunter" was nearing the end of its 
seven-year run on NBC, Dryer signed a three-year contract at Paramount with 
Brandon Tartikoff, who had recently resigned as chairman of NBC Entertainment 
to run the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 One brainchild of Tartikoff's was to put popular TV stars, who are seen in 
living rooms across America in tens of millions of households, into moderately 
budgeted movies and watch the cash roll in. Dryer was poised to launch his 
feature-film career in a movie called "And Justice for One." 
</P>
<P>
 But before the cameras were ready to roll, Tartikoff abruptly left Paramount, 
Sherry Lansing replaced him, and she put Dryer's film into turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brandon loved the movie, and he wanted to do it," said Dryer, 48. "We had it 
all ready to go and then he left. When he did, the impending storm hit us: the 
new regime. And they said, 'We're not interested. We're not interested in you, 
and we're not interested in the project.' I was pretty much dead in the water 
theatrically." 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount's television division tried desperately to get Dryer to do a TV 
series, either a half-hour comedy or an hour drama. But he refused, choosing 
instead to focus his energy on developing his own production company. If he was 
going to star in television, he wanted to produce and own the programming, 
making sure it could play in foreign markets to address his huge overseas 
following. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do know that television drives the world," Dryer said. "It's a software 
business, and those who have a library to supply that need in the coming years 
will be the ones in good shape. I want to be a part of that future." 
</P>
<P>
 That's when "Day of Reckoning" was presented to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Paramount would own "Day of Reckoning," the internationally flavored 
production offered Dryer a solid first project for his new company to produce 
and supply to NBC, where he has a three-movie deal. Dryer became executive 
producer, along with his partner, Victor Schiro. 
</P>
<P>
 The pairing of Silliphant and Dryer seemed a natural. In "Hunter," Dryer 
played a maverick cop with a female partner, incompetent superiors and a 
massive Magnum revolver. "Hunter" was crafted after Clint Eastwood's successful 
"Dirty Harry" movies, specifically "The Enforcer," the only one to pair 
Eastwood with a female partner. Silliphant wrote "The Enforcer." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dryer didn't share Silliphant's vision of "Day of Reckoning." Dryer 
changed much of Silliphant's script before he arrived in Asia, collaborating 
uneasily with Silliphant by fax to avoid costly phone bills. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There really was no story there before," Dryer said. "It was about a guy who 
lived out on a rice barge in front of the hotel. He had a travel agency, with 
these slow-turning fans, and a lot of women taking care of him. He was a 
typical American expatriate who lives in Asia for specific womanizing reasons, 
and he was very sexist. It was very deprecating to the Thais. I brought in a 
guy who's there because he has found a place in the world that fits him." 
</P>
<P>
 Silliphant denies there were any sexist aspects to his original story. From 
his viewpoint, Dryer "slashed and burned" all of the subtleties in his script, 
all of the dialogue that wasn't of the "let's go" variety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw all the grace notes and textures of the writing and characterizations 
vanish one by one -- the dialogue reduced to easy banality or to strong, silent 
looks; the story line pounded into an A-B-C linear form," Silliphant said. 
"There may still be two scenes left in the entire two-hour movie in which some 
hint, some faint luster of the original writing, may be sensed." 
</P>
<P>
 Dryer explained his approach: "I have a pretty good sense of who I am and what 
I want to do. I know my limitations. I know what I'm capable of doing. And I 
know what people want to see. So I took the germ of the idea and just started 
restructuring it. It's no longer a closed mystery; it was before. Everything 
was very veiled. It was tough to follow. Now it's just straight on. Everything 
is out in the open. You get to see the bad guys and you can follow it easily." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did Dryer feel comfortable relying heavily on the Thai film industry's 
infrastructure for technical support, as Silliphant had in mind. A 
multinational crew came in from London, Hong Kong and the United States for 
filming last spring in Bangkok and the jungle mountains of Krabi to the south. 
The entire project was overseen by a contingent of Hollywood "suits" -- studio 
executives at Paramount and network executives at NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, this oil-and-water mix cost us at least $1 million more than 
it should have had we been able to shoot with a 95% Thai crew and not whip into 
the mix Brits, Yanks and Hong Kong Chinese," Silliphant said. 
</P>
<P>
 Filming wrapped in June. After an inordinately long post-production period, 
NBC announced an air date last month. Even the title of the movie was changed 
at the last minute because the original title, "The Wisdom Keeper," tested 
poorly with audiences and didn't have "enough punch," as Dryer put it. 
</P>
<P>
 Dryer blamed part of the post-production delays on a Thai script supervisor 
who did not properly catalogue the thousands of feet of film that were shot. 
Silliphant blamed it on the continuing divisiveness of the separate cliques 
pulling at the final production like taffy: Paramount, NBC, Dryer's production 
company and British director Brian Grant. Neither NBC nor Paramount would make 
anyone available to comment on the final version that airs Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Silliphant found the entire experience to be "depressing, 
dispiriting, debilitating," calling "Day of Reckoning" the "most degrading 
period of my career." The expatriate character of Jack O'Brien still holds 
untapped potential for Silliphant. He would consider getting involved if NBC 
wants to turn the movie into a regular franchise, but he doesn't believe that's 
likely to happen after all the hassles. 
</P>
<P>
 Silliphant still maintains his dream of establishing a production mecca in 
Southeast Asia. He's currently networking wealthy Thais for investors, and he's 
writing a screenplay called "Forever," to be directed in Thailand by one of the 
country's leading directors, Prince Chatrichalerm Yugala. This time Silliphant 
will work without help from Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that bothers me about America is the American insular point of 
view," he said. "Our refusal to learn languages. Our refusal to really look 
around and see this is one big world. . . . We are so absolutely insulated -- 
and Hollywood, in particular. We're like in a shell. We're like the crab. We 
scuttle around on the rocks but we can't break out of the shell to realize this 
is a huge world. And there are wonderful films to be made." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their differences, Dryer sounds like Silliphant in some ways: "I left 
the studio system, and I'm on my own. I have autonomy now, and I have an 
opportunity to enter into television and all the projects I do as a free 
agent." 
</P>
<P>
 Dryer won't rule out working as an actor for hire -- apparently plans are 
under way with NBC and producer Stephen J. Cannell to do a "Hunter" TV movie. 
And Dryer would play O'Brien again, if called upon. But Dryer said he will make 
his priority Fred Dryer Productions, where he has a motion picture and several 
TV projects in development. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to address a world market," he said. "People here know who I am 
because of television, and people around the world in 94 countries know who I 
am because of it. I want to attack the world theatrical market with 
smaller-budget features, and then come back in a television project on a world 
level that is right for me. When I do, I will own that. I'm looking for 
ownership, not fees. I want to establish a company that's in it for the long 
haul."

HE'S GOT EYES; THE 1950S ARE STRIPPED BARE WITH THE REISSUE OF ROBERT FRANK'S 
STARK, SUBVERSIVE PHOTOGRAPHY.; THE AMERICANS, BY ROBERT FRANK, (SCALO 
PUBLISHERS/DAP: $50 CLOTH, $26.50 PAPER; 179 PP.)

<TEXT>
<P>
 Photography, goes one clear-eyed definition, is a record fixed on silver of 
the light waves reflected by or radiating from objects. The human eye, like the 
camera, can collect these rays, but it fixes them only in memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Photography has advanced by now to the technological point where it occupies 
and "eyewitnesses" its own reality. A pre-set camera can gather images while 
orbiting the Earth via satellite, or it can snap your mug shot as you write a 
check for staples at the supermarket -- no human finger on the trigger, no call 
and response of "Say cheese." 
</P>
<P>
 The scarcely ambiguous footage of the Rodney King beating to the contrary, 
such images constitute dead-on accounts of an event such as a crime, or a 
relative close-up of a place as trackless to the naked eye as deep space. The 
"information" obtained by such means is real and reliable, part and parcel of 
the process of comprehending "truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the camera is merely a tool, capable of no more than mechanical 
honesty. The individual photographer must supply the aesthetic and make any 
attempt to distinguish between a random, meaningless moment and the rare moment 
of reality revealed, existence cast in a new light. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the spate of "art photography" books available in overpriced editions 
these days seem to be trying to get away with art, rather than delivering it. 
Shutter-buggery lines bookstore shelves, alternating between the illusory 
prettiness of nature photography and the celebrity-worshiping snapshots of the 
haute paparazzi, perhaps best typified by Vanity Fair's Annie Liebovitz. To 
anyone who has spent time looking at photography, Liebovitz's flashy studies of 
the momentarily famous are, in essence, stunts. Pop technicians of this caliber 
have no guiding intentions, no aesthetic stake beyond the hope for a smooth 
shoot, the haute -er the better. 
</P>
<P>
 Photographic work of a wholly different and higher order is represented in 
Robert Frank's knife-edged master-piece, "The Americans," now available again 
after a shamefully long period out of print. The volume was first published in 
Paris in 1958, then in America by Grove Press in 1959. Frank, a Swiss-German 
emigre, studied with Henri Cartier-Bresson in Paris before settling in New York 
in 1947. His early images of street life -- dark, intense, often disturbing -- 
established him as a premier talent in a photographic lineage that includes 
Jacob Riis, Lewis Hine, Walker Evans, W. Eugene Smith, Weegee and Dorothea 
Lange. Such was the power of "The Americans" that Frank in turn influenced a 
whole school of younger documentary photographers -- Larry Clark, Bruce 
Davidson, Garry Winogrand, and Danny Lyon, to name but a few. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyon recalled in a Times interview in 1992: "(Frank) played a huge role in 
liberating American photography. The horizons are cockeyed in his images, a 
guy's head is behind a tree, part of the picture is blurred -- he blew 
photography wide open and he's been a tremendous influence on countless 
artists, including me. Eventually I had to get away from Robert because he was 
too strong a force to be around." 
</P>
<P>
 You can get a pungent sense of Frank's youthful life and force in Patricia 
Bosworth's well-researched "Diane Arbus: A Biography" (Knopf, 1984). Frank and 
his sculptor wife Mary lived in a grungy loft with their two wild children 
while he eked out a bare existence shooting fashion spreads and photojournalism 
at $50 a throw for Fortune, Life and Harper's Bazaar. The Franks, known as a 
"pagan couple," were part of a loose-knit arts community that encompassed 
old-style Greenwich Village bohemia, the Abstract Expressionists and the Beats. 
In the lockstep mid-1950s, when the Man in the Gray Flannel Suit was our 
national symbol, Frank personified the dissident artist, and his stark, 
subversive imagery constituted a form of fugitive expression akin to samizdat. 
Just as you had to "dig" to understand bop, you had to "have eyes" to dig 
Frank. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1955, traveling with Jack Kerouac, Frank crisscrossed the United States on 
an assignment for Life, but his hard-edged roadside pictures were rejected 
because "they looked too much like Russia." Then in 1956, sponsored by the 
patrician Walker Evans, Frank won a Guggenheim and spent the following year 
driving around the country in a clunker car with his family in tow. The 
entourage must have resembled a hip version of the Joads. In Arkansas, Frank 
was arrested for possessing a suspicious accent, a stubbly beard and New York 
plates. (Say cheese, indeed.) 
</P>
<P>
 All the same, he kept shooting photos of highways and windows, flags and 
jukeboxes, crosses and blaring TV sets and rural death -- recurring motifs that 
reflected the juiceless complacency of the Eisenhower-McCarthy era and its 
undercurrent of emptiness for those who dwelt outside the hallowed System and 
who perhaps once in a while entertained "un-American" thoughts. "I enlarged all 
the pictures I liked," Frank recalled later, "maybe two hundred of them. . . . 
Then I put them together in three sections and I started each section with the 
American flag and each section with the American flag and each section with no 
people and then people." 
</P>
<P>
 And what people Frank's somber eye picked out to show us that there was an 
emerging subterranean nation taking shape in the shadows and unmapped corners 
of the official one. In "Newburgh, New York" and "Indianapolis," Frank framed 
shots of leather-clad biker gang members, fixing them in a Dantesque suspension 
between ordinary life and a new kind of life without ordinary boundaries. 
Prowling through the era's metaphoric lonely crowd, he singled out cowboys, 
young stud hustlers, a soldier and his whore, a Southwestern Indian bending 
over a Las Vegas jukebox -- mostly solitaries and outcasts. Respect and 
sympathy are implicit in Frank's selection of images, and each shot has a 
specific sense of character, location and time that puts the viewer in the 
heart of the moment that the photograph records. Frank could make a grab-shot 
composition do a prodigious amount of work, as in "Rooming House -- Bunker 
Hill, Los Angeles" and "Mississippi River, Baton Rouge, Louisiana." The first 
shows an elderly pensioner obscured by a staircase in a columned slum, and the 
second a religious pilgrim kneeling at prayer on the Mississippi's shore. Both 
shots function at the same time on symbolic and stabbingly literal levels. Both 
are chilly in spirit and yet moving. A tacit narrative carries the eye 
relentlessly forward, like scenes from a road movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidental with the reappearance of "The Americans," let me cite another 
neglected work -- W.T. Lhamon Jr.'s groundbreaking critical study called 
"Deliberate Speed: The Origins of a Cultural Style in the American 1950s" 
(Smithsonian Institution Press: 1990). In it, the author gives pride of place 
to Frank as one of the key aesthetic innovators of the decade, along with Jack 
Kerouac, Thomas Pynchon, Little Richard, Ornette Coleman, Ralph Ellison, Allen 
Ginsberg, Jackson Pollock and Ludwig Wittgenstein. "The quality uniting so many 
of these (artists') apparently disparate and subsequently important works is 
that they were born fighting the forces ignoring and suppressing them," Lhamon 
writes. "And most important: insofar as art can win anything, this insurgent 
culture won." 
</P>
<P>
 If I have any cavil with Lhamon's rigorous and persuasive argument, it's that 
he all but ignores the shaping impact of the noir literary and cinematic 
culture that permeated the 1940s and '50s. Frank, for example, like most 
artists his age, was steeped to the bone in noir's bleak expressionist 
conventions, and many of the 83 black-and-white compositions that make up "The 
Americans" might have been illustrations for a Geoffrey Homes tough-guy novel 
or outtakes from a Robert Siodmak production. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank published one other significant collection -- "The Lines of My Hand" in 
1972 -- but it was already a valedictory of sorts. The book includes his final 
1958 photo essay called "Bus Series" -- 10 abruptly cropped and oddly hellish 
pictures taken on a bus traversing Manhattan's 42nd Street. Afterward, telling 
friends he didn't want to repeat himself, he turned to the making of 
documentary films. Frank's screen works include the Beat improvisation "Pull My 
Daisy" (1959), featuring Kerouac and Ginsberg and the notoriously raunchy film 
about a 1972 Rolling Stones tour. Sadly, these and other Frank documentaries 
are all "underground" movies that essentially can't be seen anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Americans," Frank went searching for America's soul and found avatars 
of Desolation Row, prophetic images of the counterculture before there 
officially was such a thing. He influenced, I am tempted to say, the best minds 
of my generation -- not only other photographers, but musicians, poets, 
painters scholars, and journalists, including me. With his outsider's eye and 
his human finger on the trigger, Frank gave us clues about who to watch, what 
to see, and a way to see it. In shots like quick incisions, he showed a society 
where, for the first time, anything could happen. Much like De Tocqueville a 
century before him, he charted a hidden America where mysteries abound and 
apocalyptic truth -- or ragged beauty -- always hides just around the next 
hairpin curve. Thirty-five years after its first appearance, "The Americans" is 
both an enduring testament to Frank's artistic purity and a towering artifact 
of its time. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Scalo edition -- incorporating Kerouac's loopily endearing 1959 
introduction -- is handsome and well designed. Having the book at hand again is 
like welcoming an old friend back to the fold. Over the decades, I must have 
owned four or five copies of the original Grove Press edition, the last one 
vanishing down the road with a departing girlfriend several incarnations ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Let the sainted Kerouac have the final word in his trademark fractured poesy: 
"The humor, the sadness, the EVERYTHING-ness and American-ness of these 
pictures! . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody doesnt like these pitchers don't like potry, see? Anybody dont like 
potry go home see. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "To Robert Frank I now give this message: You got eyes."

FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE; MERRY MEN, BY CAROLYN CHUTE (HARCOURT, BRACE: $24.95; 695 
PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By William Griffin, William Griffin is working on his second novel, Faithful 
but Unfortunate. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Approaching this novel to review, I felt something like a Peace Corps 
volunteer arriving at a bad patch of world real estate in need of international 
help. Name of the spot is Egypt, not an African country but an American town, 
not the one in Georgia or Mississippi or New York, but the one in southwestern 
Maine. Not that there is much acreage in that part of the state where it meets 
New Hampshire and the Atlantic Ocean. Not that you can find it in the gazetteer 
at the back of the National Geographic Atlas of the World. But surely an entry 
in the next edition of the Dictionary of Imaginary Places. 
</P>
<P>
 In one sense, Egypt is an Erewhon of a place, a made-up No-wheres-ville 
inhabited by people who are economically depressed, profoundly moral, wildly 
funny, extremely fertile, work- and family-oriented, with little education and 
with none of what the world calls sophistication. Anglo-Celtic stock, really, 
with names like Bean, Fogg, Cole, Plummer, Johnson, Anderson, Dougherty, 
Barrington. Yeomanry of the sort that has won all of the just wars in this 
century but that in peacetime has been all but forgotten in the congresses and 
parliaments. 
</P>
<P>
 In another sense, Erewhon is not, as it was in Samuel Butler's novels, a 
utopia where the enemy -- the enemy that had to be destroyed -- was the 
machine. Happiness in this Egypt is associated with machinery, at least the 
four-wheeled kind, where humankind is at one with pickups and backhoes, Mercs 
and Trans Ams, Fords and Chevys, an occasional Volvo, a solo Saab. Wheels -- 
including Harleys -- are, it seems, the heartbeat of Egypt, if the advertising 
slogan of one species can be made to stand for the genus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Homer of these Egyptians is Carolyn Chute, happily remembered for two 
previous novels, "The Beans of Egypt, Maine" and "Letourneau's Used Auto 
Parts." According to a CBS-TV profile, she lives where and what she writes. She 
has wild hair, wears comfortable clothes and moves about in boots. She dropped 
out of high school at age 16 to have her daughter. She's 46 years old now, on 
her second marriage, this time to a man who, like many of the rugged men in her 
novels, can't read or write. And she has three grandchildren to crow about. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are not many writers in the United States who can live on just their 
writings," she told the television interviewer. Shacks and trailers dot her 
real, as well as her literary, landscape. With her book and film earnings, she 
has built a comfortable house for her family; the convenience, though, is 
inconvenient; it's not in the house; it's in the outhouse out back, and it's 
unheated; but she does have a snow-blower. 
</P>
<P>
 To follow but one character in her epic novel is to begin with Lloyd 
Barrington who is 8 3/4 at novel's start and by novel's end is 
40ish-going-on-60ish. As a boy he fantasized that he was Super Tree Man; at 
night, when the rest of his family was asleep, he donned a comic-book cape and 
capered about Egypt planting trees. As a mature man he is a wounded, festering 
worker-thinker, occasionally spouting speeches that sound like a Shavian 
character mouthing off against munitions factories in a windy play of ideas at 
the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Paris of this epic -- that is to say, the pretty-boy villain -- is the 
corporation (agribusiness is singled out by the author in her dedication) that 
has bled dry Egypt's dark-veined men like Lloyd, who during the course of the 
novel lose their businesses, their homes, their money, their children. To 
survive with their families and maintain some natural dignity, some of them -- 
at least Lloyd -- have resorted to some Robin Hood-like strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 The straw that breaks the camel's back in Egypt is the selling to an anonymous 
buyer of 16,000 acres, which amounts to half the town. Condition of the sale is 
the closing of the paper mill on that property. For the townspeople that means, 
again according to the author in her dedication, "welfare lines, prisons, or 
the slavery of Big Business." Retribution extracted by the not-so-merry men of 
Egypt is swift, bizarre, sophisticated. Like all such acts, it's symbolically 
satisfying, but ultimately it's ineffectual, save for sending one female 
character -- albeit a middle-class one -- to the psychiatric ward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Merry Men" is altogether a successful novel, creating as it does a real world 
with real characters involved in life-and-death issues, giving authentic voice 
to a segment of American society that has had little representation in the 
Knesset of the novel. 
</P>
<P>
 But after three books, time is running out for the author. Her original style 
and sprawling narrative are laced with inconsistencies, even within the 
guidelines set down by the novelist herself. Sooner or later middle-classic 
critics -- mean-minded men and women who get paid to make authors miserable -- 
will run out of patience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Merry Men" is not a book for the people Chute writes about; at $24.95 most 
can't afford it; at 600-plus pages, few can read it, even though it's composed 
in their own lingo. It's a book for middle-class readers who are employed, many 
of them, by the sort of corporation Chute excoriates -- readers who not only 
have been educated to support the idea of the novel in general but also have 
the discretionary funds to keep the genre in headbands and foot bands. Is there 
a message in "Merry Men" for them? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see much difference between human beings . . . lower classes and 
higher classes," Chute told the television interviewer. "I see everybody doing 
their best to get through the day." 
</P>
<P>
 That echoes the sentiment of the middle-class character whose bell was rung at 
the end of the novel; shortly before that, she was trying to drum some sense 
into the head of that quintessential Egyptian, Lloyd Barrington, who did go to 
college and majored in sociology. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know that just being alive, one has to face daily trials. Some people 
just pretend well, Lloyd. . . . Believe me, please, all people aren't what they 
seem."

THELMA AND LOUISE, 30 YEARS LATER; LIFE ESTATES, BY SHELBY HEARON (ALFRED A. 
KNOPF: $22 ; 231 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Pauline Mayer, Pauline Mayer is a free-lance writer and critic based in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shelby Hearon's 13 novels mark her as a feel-good writer. Any representative 
sampling of her work would include the sunny "Hug Dancing" (1991), the 
hilarious "Owning Jolene" (1989) and the sharp-edged "Small Town" (1985). All 
strike a delicate balance between poignancy and high comedy. "Life Estates" is 
no exception; it glows with Hearon's characteristic wit and compassion even 
while it explores an uncharacteristically somber topic: mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout her entire body of work runs one consistent clarion call: However 
beset we are, however vulnerable, it behooves us to thumb our nose at fate, 
take control, change what's changeable and make the absolute best of what 
cannot be changed. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a message echoed, loud and clear, by 55-year-old Sarah Cooper, the 
feisty feminist narrator of Hearon's latest novel. It is echoed again, faintly, 
almost too late, but with great gallantry, by Sarah's eternally young-at-heart 
friend, Harriet Sloane. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah and Harriet have been buddies ever since they boarded together at Miss 
Pritchard's, "one of the country's best marriage preparatory schools." Although 
Sarah lives in the Blue Ridge Mountains of South Carolina and Harriet in east 
Texas, the amazing symmetry of their lives has kept them close. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean," marvels Harriet, "(We've) been in each other's weddings, married 
bankers, had our boys and then our girls the same years, got separate bedrooms 
at the same time. . . ." They have, in fact, walked each other's lifelines for 
40 years, phoning one another often, exchanging twice-yearly visits. And now, 
just months after Sarah's husband has died of cancer, Harriet's husband 
perishes in a car crash. "Life Estates" gets underway as the two women confront 
widowhood -- separately and together. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back on her life, the newly widowed Sarah wryly acknowledges the irony 
of her marriage. Just out of school, she plunged into matrimony with handsome 
hunk Nolan because she thought him sexually exciting. It took her some years to 
realize that he was insensitive to all her needs, sexual and otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Making a tolerable accommodation to marriage, Sarah staked claims to freedom 
and fulfillment elsewhere. She took long drives through the lovely countryside 
to commune with nature. She gardened with passion. Eventually she co-founded a 
custom wallpaper business, servicing the area's old historical homes and 
catering to the women who treasure them. As the business flourished, Sarah even 
persuaded her jealously paternalistic husband to agree to separate tax returns 
and separate checking accounts. Freedom indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 After his death, Sarah breaks the last bond with control freak Nolan by 
rejecting the "life interest" he bequeathed her against her explicit wishes. 
Like her approving mother, an elderly entomologist off to study rare spiders in 
the Patagonian rain forest, Sarah knows how to seize the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Once she is released from the bondage of a lousy marriage, Sarah relishes the 
new freedoms widowhood offers. She particularly savors new-found intimacy with 
a 70-year-old doctor who has admired her for years. Unlike Nolan, he provides 
her with understanding, companionship and good sex. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Sarah's friend, the petite and gorgeous Harriet, is devastated by 
her husband's death. Outgoing and popular, Harriet "could have been dropped at 
the North Pole and had a dozen chums by nightfall." For years she has spent 
every weekday morning with the 11 women friends of her "Birthday Club." Like 
Sarah, she got little support from her husband and felt herself more his 
appendage than partner. Moreover, she discovers soon into widowhood that he had 
a long-term affair with a "tacky size 10." 
</P>
<P>
 Adrift and scared, Harriet buys a gun for protection. She dreams of seducing 
an attentive younger man. She frets obsessively about her daughter, who seems 
determined to deny Harriet the grandchildren she craves. Harriet hasn't a clue, 
Sarah realizes, as to why her own daughter rejects motherhood while Sarah's 
daughter is a regular "brood hen." Further differences between the two women, 
unexamined for years, gradually surface. 
</P>
<P>
 The friendship subtly changes, and changes drastically, when the two friends 
suddenly find themselves face to face with their own mortality, too. That it 
survives, as strong as ever, is a tribute to the resilience of the two women, 
Harriet as much as Sarah, and to the redemptive power of friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah may be a bit over-zealous as a feminist, a bit under-involved as a 
mother, but she is altogether attractive -- bright, caring, strong. It is, 
however, the funny/sad Harriet who touches the heart and stays in the head. 
Around these two ultimately heroic heroines Hearon has woven yet another live 
affirming novel which, while not profound, is profoundly readable and 
satisfying.

RICHARD EDER: ART NEEDS ITS ENEMIES; I AM SNOWING: THE CONFESSIONS OF A WOMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 The collapse of totalitarian communism in the nations of the former Soviet 
bloc has left their literature almost as rudderless as our foreign policy. 
Their great dissident writers produced a renaissance under the fertile sign of 
the third-person plural. Images of humanity took shape in apposition to the 
ever-present and abominable "they." In Europe's new or newly re-established 
democracies the crisis for the writer is to find that suddenly "they" have 
become "us"; and where do we find the shadows that once made our light so 
bright? By itself the light is only so-so. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavel Kohout's "I Am Snowing" takes these new uncertainties and makes mordant 
and exuberant use of them. His novel is a portrayal of the great unraveling 
that began with Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution. If at night, as the phrase 
goes, all cats are black, by dawn they are all gray and it takes a keen eye, a 
joyful sense of paradox and a considerable ethical purposefulness to figure out 
which cat was which an hour or two earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Snowing" we glimpse a crusading "Communist-hunter" journalist who for 
years wrote the party line. We meet a former dissident painter who is now a 
cultural bureaucrat and wears a necktie, which he hastily yanks off whenever 
one of his old friends visits him. And many more such metamorphoses. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohout was prominent among the artists and intellectuals in the 1968 Prague 
Spring. Nine years after the Soviet invasion Kohout, along with Vaclav Havel, 
was one of the authors of the Charter 77 manifesto that again challenged the 
official repression. Havel was jailed and Kohout was exiled to Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohout shares with Havel a quality of moral spaciousness, along with a sense 
of the particular and the absurd that the latter -- now that he is a president 
and not a playwright -- is less free to indulge. "I Am Snowing" is a novel of 
ideas but of ideas that refuse to be dull. It is a novel of extraordinarily 
well-managed suspense whose question is not who done it or who will get done; 
but what was it they did and what was its meaning. And finally it is a novel 
about a charmingly expansive woman who bumbles and plate-smashes her way 
through the ambiguities of the day to find out the truth about two former 
lovers; and whose erratic trail sketches the picaresque portrait of a 
post-Communist society. 
</P>
<P>
 Petra Marova is approaching 50 with her fires only partly banked. A former 
husband and at least a dozen lovers lie -- or lay -- in her past; and a weedy 
young colleague at the newspaper where she works is conducting a calf-like 
siege. She has a punk daughter for whom she tries to set a good example, and 
she is a devout if not exactly docile Catholic. None of this is proof against 
her real passion. Victor, a former lover who was exiled to Canada, is back as a 
high-level economic adviser to a government that is energetically restoring 
capitalism. He is her "king" and they make ecstatic love, but only once or 
twice since he is terribly busy and has, besides, brought his wife Vanesa with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Much to Petra's embarrassment, Vanesa, mousy and plain, comes to her for help. 
Victor's name has turned up in the newly disclosed files of the security police 
as a collaborator; a shocking thing since he has always been known as a man of 
humane principles and intellectual integrity. Surely it must be a mistake, 
Petra and Vanesa agree. In reality, police files have proven to be the most 
damning and the most suspect of sources in the wake of the Czechoslovak 
revolution, and decidedly vulnerable to manipulation. The names of a number of 
dissidents have turned up in them, and there is no possible way of establishing 
either their innocence or guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Petra, however, was once the lover of Jozef, himself a former police official 
though seemingly -- almost everything is "seemingly" in the book, which is one 
of its points -- one of the decent ones. In fact he was jailed by his superiors 
after putting his own signature on the Charter 77 document. Petra goes to see 
him; he reveals that it was he who entered Victor's name in the files, but for 
a good reason. Victor, a friend, was near breakdown; listing him as an agent 
seemed harmless at the time and made it possible for him to get a passport to 
emigrate. In any case, Jozef -- now a flourishing agent for Austrian investors 
-- will be glad to absolve him. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not so simple, though. Besides politics, there are passions. Throughout 
"Snowing" the trail of political and personal motives is hopelessly entangled. 
Jozef still loves Petra, he is jealous of Victor and finally he is stung by 
Petra's lofty condescension about his former police status. (Her break with 
him, years earlier, came when in the course of a marriage proposal he revealed 
his identity.) Spitefully, perhaps -- always perhaps -- he tells her that 
although Victor's dossier is a fake, he was in fact an informant for another 
security agent, now dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Petra is in agony. She loves and reveres Victor; she loved and had finally 
come to respect Jozef. In a number of beautifully written scenes, set both in 
the present and the past, Kohout makes us share her sympathy with both men 
along with her wrenching doubts. The onion-like layers of revelation disclose a 
variety of other figures, emblematic of the times and rendered with wit, 
humanity and a full assortment of their own paradoxes and contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohout's heroine is not one to languish in her doubts. She pursues them, 
clumsily, comically, furiously. Petra is in one venerable tradition of the 
Eternal Feminine: the woman who loves not wisely but too well and too often, 
but whose earthy instincts end up making her unstoppable. She wins us over 
though sometimes we may wish she would stop a little. She is greatly wordy 
about almost everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohout can be loose and self-indulgent. But the tension of his and Petra's 
pursuit of the truth rarely lets up; and in the course of it we get some 
extraordinary human portraits. Vanesa grows luminously out of her apparent 
mousiness; her own story is one of the book's high points. Another has the 
force of a one-act play. It is Petra's visit to Jozef's family -- mine workers 
who suffered atrociously and for whom communism has meant a good and decent 
life. Even then, over an abundant and hospitable dinner table, there is furious 
argument between the grandfather (an official who turned against the Party when 
the Russians invaded) and his daughters on one side; and his wife and Jozef's 
brothers, who have their doubts but remain loyal. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohout gives a subtle and varied account of the intimately human 
contradictions and paradoxes that arise in a long dictatorship and live after 
it. If this were all, he would have written an excellent book but not nearly as 
good a book as this. To understand all -- and we certainly come to understand 
Victor and Jozef -- is not to forgive all. Among our contradictions we must 
make a choice. Before forgiveness there must be judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 The book's American editor, Elisabeth Dyssegaard, has summed up its theme in a 
sentence on the jacket too exact not to quote: "After 40 years of terror and 
submission, who are we now and how much does it matter who we were before?" 
Kohout wonderfully explores the first part of the question, and he gives a 
painful answer to the second: It matters, utterly. 
</P>
<P>
 At Jozef's family dinner table the granddaughter, who had remained quiet, 
finally speaks up. She is to be a teacher. Will you teach them about the heroic 
pre-war struggle of the Communist Party against the mine owners, the 
grandmother asks. Yes, the 13-year-old answers, and also about the terrible 
things the party did in power. And she adds in a phrase that is entirely 
Kohout's and entirely hers: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to tell my students that they have a choice between the truth and 
the lie, nothing more."

BORN IN THE TOWER OF BABBLE; THE LANGUAGE INSTINCT: HOW THE MIND CREATES 
LANGUAGE, BY STEVEN PINKER (WILLIAM MORROW: $23; 494 PP.) ; PATTERNS IN THE

By Roger Lewin, Roger Lewin is a writer in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His most

American Library, 1993.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago, a newspaper report from a scientific meeting read, "Ability to 
Learn Grammar Laid to Gene by Researcher." To psychologists and linguists, the 
notion that grammatical rules might be the inflexible products of strings of 
DNA molecules, rather than having been shaped by the nuances of a cultural 
milieu, was stunning, not to say heretical. To the syndicated columnist Erma 
Bombeck, however, it all made perfect sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Bombeck's husband once taught English in high school. "He had 37 grammar-gene 
deficients in his class at one time," she informed her readers. To them, she 
explained, "a comma could have been a petroglyph. A subjective complement was 
something you said to a friend when her hair came out right. A dangling 
participle was not their problem." And yet, Bombeck speculated, each and every 
one of these kids finished up as major sports figures, rock stars and 
television personalities, "who make millions spewing out words such as bummer, 
radical and awesome and thinking they are complete sentences." 
</P>
<P>
 Bombeck's observations aside, one of the great mysteries of human life is the 
fact that children learn language (not just words, but complicated grammatical 
structure) with amazing facility -- yeah, like, I mean, really! In his 
"Patterns in the Mind," Ray Jackendoff refers to this as the Paradox of 
Language Acquisition. If linguists are so smart, how come they're so dumb that 
they can't do what kids of two can do while chucking food around the room and 
sticking their fingers into electrical outlets? That is, figure out the 
principles behind the grammatical patterns of various languages. 
</P>
<P>
 The nature of language has long fascinated scholars. Obsessed would be a more 
accurate description. And perhaps it's not surprising that scholars whose stock 
in trade is words should be able to employ them with such stinging effect 
against their academic adversaries: They do so at every opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a huge intellectual divide across which their carefully hewn 
invectives are hurled with such enthusiasm. On one side, there are those who 
believe that language acquisition is an innate process, which is fine tuned by 
the environment in early infancy. On the other side, children are viewed as 
acquiring language solely through learning, through attentive imitation of 
Motherese and other voices they hear in the babble about them. 
</P>
<P>
 The most prominent proponent of language as an innate phenomenon is Noam 
Chomsky, a linguist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). When, 
in 1957, Chomsky published his landmark book "Syntactic Structures," he 
challenged the prevailing wisdom of psychology -- namely, behaviorism. 
According to the behaviorists, nothing existed in the brain that hadn't been 
put there through experience. In other words, we come into the world with a 
mental blank slate. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Chomsky's strongest arguments was the Paradox of Language Acquisition. 
Normal learning patterns surely could not explain the phenomenon. Children must 
therefore be innately equipped with an understanding of grammar. Chomsky called 
this a Universal Grammar. 
</P>
<P>
 Chomsky's view became dominant, forcing linguists to focus on syntax as the 
central feature of language acquisition -- for a while. Amid mini-rebellions 
among Chomsky's acolytes, those who favor language as a learned behavior have 
recently made a comeback, although not in the strict behaviorist mold. Steven 
Pinker's "The Language Instinct" and Jackendoff's "Patterns of the Mind" 
represent blasts from the innatists' side of the divide. 
</P>
<P>
 Both authors present evidence in favor of a strong genetic basis for the 
learning of language. And both view language as just one of many behaviors that 
are generated by genetically determined modules within the brain. Both books 
are therefore provocative, not only in their uncompromising promotion of the 
innatists' program in linguistics, but also in extending this paradigm to other 
realms of human behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackendoff and Pinker proffer similar evidence and weave similar arguments in 
making the case for the Genetic Hypothesis of language. But their approach as 
authors is different. "My goal is to offer the reader a few evenings of 
engagement with the ideas of linguistics, without a great investment in 
technical detail," Jackendoff says. "For better or worse," Pinker concedes, "I 
can write in only one way, with a passion for powerful, explanatory ideas and a 
torrent of relevant detail." Both authors are true to their word, and each book 
is splendid in its own way. It is therefore up to potential buyers to select 
the amount of detail for which they have appetites. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the evidence presented in favor of the Genetic Hypothesis will be 
familiar to those with a passing interest in the science. For instance, if, as 
the supporters of the cultural model argue, language is absorbed in a cultural 
context, with the mind acting as a general purpose learning machine, brain 
defects that affect overall intelligence would be expected to impair language 
in like manner. This is not what happens. Language-impaired individuals are 
often of average intelligence. Moreover, the existence of linguistic idiot 
savants, that is people with highly developed language but below normal 
intelligence, deals a severe blow to the learning model of language 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 "If language is an instinct," says Pinker, "it should have an identifiable 
seat in the brain." This, effectively, is what is seen with deficits that occur 
as a result of trauma to different areas of the brain: sometimes syntax is 
affected, sometimes the recognition of nouns, other times the ability to use 
certain verbs. There does appear to be an identifiable seat of language, or, 
rather, several seats, interconnected in complex ways, as new research with 
different forms of brain scanners is beginning to show. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinker's own research is with infants. Specifically, he's interested in the 
errors that children make: "My teacher holded the baby rabbits"; I finded 
Renee"; "I love cut-upped egg." Infant utterings of this kind, which we all 
think are so cute, are rich in information. "The errors children do make are 
rarely random garbage," notes Pinker. "Often the errors follow the logic of 
grammar so beautifully that the puzzle is not why the children make the errors, 
but why they sound like errors to adult ears." The infants are not repeating 
what they hear in daily discourse, but are logically extrapolating standard 
rules to irregular cases. 
</P>
<P>
 A new line of evidence that supports innatism, mentioned by Jackendoff and 
savored by Pinker, is the discovery by a Canadian linguist of a grammatical 
defect in otherwise normal members of a British family. Geneticists have shown 
that the deficit is inherited as "a single dominant gene, just like pink 
flowers on Gregor Mendel's pea plants," says Pinker. This was the research that 
inspired Erma Bombeck's philosophical musings on grammar genes. There is, 
however, no such thing as a grammar gene. "A single gene is thought to disrupt 
grammar," explains Pinker, "but that does not mean a single gene controls 
grammar." Many genes are likely to be involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Pinker and Jackendoff are champions of the Chomskian position, but 
they depart in at least one important direction. Although Chomsky views 
language ability as the product of a language organ, he argues that it is not 
the product of conventional Darwinian evolution. Instead, he suggests, it 
emerged when the brain passed a critical size threshold in human prehistory. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, both Pinker and Jackendoff see language as the product of 
evolution based on selection of primitive communication skills in our early 
ancestors. Pinker, particularly, is an ardent champion of natural selection, 
and argues that spoken language began to emerge very early in human prehistory. 
Chomsky "has it backwards," he asserts: Humans didn't develop language because 
they evolved big brains; brains got bigger as a result of the gradual 
elaboration of structures that underlie language. There are anthropologists who 
would contest the suggestion that language has ancient roots. But there is 
neurological evidence that indicates that the major changes that occurred in 
the human brain as it expanded involved principally those regions associated 
with language. 
</P>
<P>
 And so the arguments go on . . . and on . . . and on. There is surely no 
resolution in sight, but interested observers are well served by Pinker's and 
Jackendoff's different expositions. And Pinker includes a wonderful chapter 
demolishing the stuffiness of language pedants. "It is ironic that the 
jeremiads wailing about how sloppy language leads to sloppy thought are 
themselves hairballs of loosely associated factoids and tangled non sequiturs," 
he scoffs. "As for slang, I'm all for it! . . . When given a glimpse into one 
of these lexicons (of slang), no true language-lover can fail to be dazzled by 
the brilliant wordplay and wit." Not bad for a supposedly stuffy scholar from 
MIT.

 Never have I read so touching an article on re-examining one's prejudice 
against gays as Jeff Silverman's "Getting Over It" ( Jan. 30). This chronicle 
of institutionalized homophobia gets right to the heart of bigotry 
approved.I've been a homosexual for 72 years, which adds up to a lot of 
prejudice experienced by me in every facet of my life. It's uplifting and 
inspiring to know that Silverman has arrived at the conclusion that "love 
doesn't have a gender."

 While I agree with Silverman that we should be sensitive to the struggles 
encountered by gay men and that we should fight bigotry, I disagree with his 
reasons. He quotes the old and trite: People are defined by their behavior, 
fear of right-wing extremism, and inane quotes like "love doesn't have a 
gender." All this to have us accept a lifestyle that is morally wrong. It is 
unacceptable to deny anyone the dignity that he or she deserves as a human 
being, because all are created in the image of God. But the granting of dignity 
should not be confused with acceptance of behavior.

 Perhaps we all now can be inspired to deal with our own demons, those

what Silverman's article is about. He has shown us that we all have fears to 
confront and a "closet," in some form or other, to come out of.

I WON'T DANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to Ruben Martinez's "The Dance of Nuevo L.A." (Jan. 30), I'd like 
to add the viewpoint of minority people who, having been brought up 
traditionally "American," have been made to feel inferior or ashamed because we 
don't relate culturally to the newly arrived or first-generation minorities. 
Thus, getting the short end of both sticks, we seem not to fit in anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think that my being a Latina requires that I learn the quebradita. And 
I don't think that because I am fluent in Spanish I should speak English with 
an accent. (I don't.) 
</P>
<P>
 I'm proud to be a Latina, and I learn all I can about my heritage. But I'm 
also proud to be American, and I attend a local university where I hope to 
learn enough to succeed in the professional world and achieve the American 
dream.

 Reading Martinez's article on the nuevo L.A. reminded me once again of how I 
must come to terms with my mixed emotions and feelings of uneasiness. You see, 
I don't dance la quebradita. I am a fourth-generation Mexican American on my 
father's side and sixth-generation on my mother's. Like the Anglo, I grit my 
teeth when I see the street vendors and laborers. I feel guilty at my 
reluctance to accept the new face of Southern California. I must not deny the 
new immigrants a chance of a better life, like the life my family was permitted 
to find more than 100 years ago in Texas. So today I (hesitatingly) extend my 
hand and simply say: "Bienvenidos, hermanos y hermanas. Bienvenidos."

 After he completes his quebradita, perhaps Martinez will be forthcoming enough 
to tell us when Los Angeles will become another Tijuana and Southern California 
a de facto part of Norte Mexico. Despite the in-and-out dance moves of his 
article, the intended result of Latino immigration activism is obvious.

 Though elegantly crafted, Martinez's article was far too subtle and precious 
an account of cultural transformation and immigration politics. Indeed, even 
when the "guerrilla" in Martinez "explodes," it is to answer a question as he 
should have -- neither as he did nor perhaps as he would dare, in a direct 
fashion. Subtlety can be a useful tool for persuasion, but it can also result 
in misinterpretation and misrepresentation. The realities of cultural 
transformation and immigration politics are too important to remain camouflaged 
behind the symbolism of quebradita.

 I appreciate L.A.'s rich ethnic diversity, and my life is much richer because 
of it. Yet I am alarmed at the effect recent immigration has had on our city, 
which is sinking like an overcrowded life raft under the weight of hordes of 
poorly educated, underskilled refugees, all seeking a better and easier life in 
America. Every day I see thousands of men on street corners, desperately 
seeking day labor. I fear that because they will work for lower wages they will 
put out of work a large segment of resident tradesmen and laborers, taxpaying 
U.S. citizens who are homeless or on the verge of being so. It will be 
interesting to see which ethnic group can devise some solutions to L.A.'s 
problems without adding to them. Somehow, I don't think more street vendors are 
going to help.

 Being homesick for Houston, I started listening to quebradita because it 
reminded me so much of Tex-Mex music. Learning Spanish from the radio was an 
afterthought. I'm no sociologist, but your concept of musica de bandas as a 
force to bridge the race gap just may hold up. Anyway, it works for me.

WITH HER PEN, WHO NEEDS SWORDS?; NELLIE BLY: DAREDEVIL, REPORTER, FEMINIST, BY

 The pleasure and the trepidation of reading a grown-up biography of a 
childhood role model, with all the possibilities of hero-worship fulfilled or 
idols dashed, made these 614 pages feel even weightier in my hands when I 
picked up "Nellie Bly: Daredevil, Reporter, Feminist." 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the daredevil part -- I get sick on roller coasters -- Nellie Bly 
was who I wanted to be. A "juvenile" biography I read at age 9 or 10 introduced 
me to a woman who was no self-effacing Clara Barton or Florence Nightingale 
marshmallow heroine fed to us girls as laudable, namby-pamby handmaidens of 
male waywardness. 
</P>
<P>
 Bly's was the thrilling account of a trailblazer -- emphasis blaze , as in 
glory -- a pioneering journalist who made things happen with her pen. She 
committed herself to a madhouse to expose the abuse of inmates. She labored in 
sweatshops to learn the truths about factory girls. She invited the braggadocio 
of a powerful New York lobbyist and then creamed him with his own words. She 
argued the human worth of poor women and children at a time when Victorian 
class niceties still made a distinction between deserving "ladies" and mere 
"women." 
</P>
<P>
 And of course, less significantly but to fabulous effect, Nellie Bly traveled 
around the world in 72 days, making headlines and doing it with a suitcase 
smaller than a Bullocks Wilshire shopping bag. She was America's Lady 
Lindbergh, 40 years before the Lone Eagle. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatta career. Whatta woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I was meeting her again, in this closely detailed biography of one of the 
few women who was a household word in turn-of-the-century America, star of her 
own product line and, for a time, the haphazard but powerful social conscience 
of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Ours was a mostly happy reacquaintance. 
</P>
<P>
 To the bad, it turns out that Bly was a sloppy speller, and not always 
meticulous in attributing her information. She tore up her notes after writing 
her stories (a bad idea, then and now), and she skedaddled off to wartime 
Europe in 1914 to avoid an indictment for not opening her metalworks company's 
books to a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 She nicked three years off her age when she was but 25, she sometimes flirted 
with story subjects and threatened to go to another newspaper if she was 
thwarted -- but she didn't cry to get a story. She was impulsive, brash, 
ardent, prideful, stubborn, more doer than thinker. 
</P>
<P>
 Hers was the Gilded Age of big money, big railroads, big dreams and to make 
good, she had to match it, a Horatio Algerette who valued pluck and brains and 
courage, who scrapped to support her family and make her way, and didn't mind 
crowing about it. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era when decent women's names appeared in print only three times -- at 
birth, marriage and death -- "Nellie Bly," the pseudonym that Elizabeth 
Cochrane's first editor gave her, from a Stephen Foster song, became a brand 
name for a kind of bold personal journalism that had passion and a moral 
imperative behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of Oriana Fallaci and Barbara Walters with a dose of Madonna's flair for 
publicity. Bly was one of her own best topics. "You are indifferent to 
everything," an interview subject asserted in frustration. "Not to dogs," she 
declared blithely. 
</P>
<P>
 Bly was also her own best press agent. It was hardly a Nellie Bly story if it 
didn't note that someone was charmed by her eyes or bowled over by her wit. A 
New York newspaper trade journal that never liked her much wrote snippily, "Of 
course we all know that she is the smartest woman that ever lived, and has 
accomplished more than all the men journalists of this century put together. . 
. ." (The same journal often rated New York's few women journalists by looks, 
marveling that one "comes from Boston, but does not wear eyeglasses.") 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-seven years elapsed between Bly's first newspaper story, in 1885, and 
her last. She lived through and wrote about two wars, the labor movement, 
women's suffrage, the automobile, birth control and Prohibition -- always 
confident that what she had to say was worth reading. Almost always, people 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some colleagues considered her the best newspaper reporter in the nation, full 
stop. With blunt questions put in a soft voice, she refined the interview 
technique and the intimate profile that has become de rigueur in American 
journalism. Vanity Fair has nothing on Nellie Bly. Boxer John L. Sullivan let 
her pinch his muscles, and confessed with what sounds like astonishment, "I 
have given you more than I ever gave any reporter in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Her name appeared in big type at a time when reporters rarely got bylines. She 
was willing to try anything once, but in an age of "stunt" journalism, hers 
resonated with rare personal conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 With a newspaper audience titillated by "girl reporters" pulling manly 
escapades, Bly's stunts sometimes made a point, among them the "new American 
woman," who could travel unchaperoned around the world, who journeyed to Mexico 
to report with only her mother as company. 
</P>
<P>
 Hers was not a publisher's power. When an artist sent to Cuba by William 
Randolph Hearst to illustrate battles said he couldn't find any war, Hearst 
wired back, "You furnish the pictures and I'll furnish the war." 
</P>
<P>
 Bly's force was in her passion for doing good, and her conviction that she 
could. (Both her tactics -- posing as someone she was not and her personal 
politics -- would get her the boot at most newspapers today.) The force of her 
name and her very healthy ego were, as far as she was concerned, tools to 
accomplish that. 
</P>
<P>
 Read all about it -- Nellie Bly exposes washing machine swindles, fake 
mind-readers, co-ed jails! Nellie Bly speaks out against women gambling, 
sloppily dressed suffragists and "parasite" women who don't need to work but 
take jobs from women who do! Nellie Bly praises birth control and plastic 
surgery, divorce reform and hair dye for men! 
</P>
<P>
 She could command other paper's ink on the mere promise to raise a regiment of 
women for the Spanish-American War, though nothing came of it. To an old friend 
who wrote up her later business success, she wrote disarmingly, "Aren't you 
afraid I will get a big head?" 
</P>
<P>
 One hundred years ago, only about 250 women worked as bona fide journalists at 
the nation's many newspapers. The simple fact of being a woman in a man's 
profession, coupled with Bly's eye for detail and willingness to hear people 
out, brought to her readers fresh voices they might never have heard otherwise. 
While her male colleagues wrote of the power politics of the famous Pullman 
strike and Coxey's Army, Bly visited the families. "The question Bly always 
seemed to ask of God and life," wrote author Brooke Kroeger, herself a longtime 
reporter, "was how she could do her part to save the world from wherever she 
happened to be standing." 
</P>
<P>
 Bly never stood in one place for long. From her first paper to the big New 
York dailies, the restless Bly went through as many retirements and comebacks 
as Sarah Bernhardt, each as splashy and full of promise as the first. 
</P>
<P>
 The quandary in writing Bly's biography was not a lack of published material 
or that much of it was difficult to mine, but that a life lived so publicly and 
melodramatically should yield frustratingly little firsthand information on 
Bly's private self. 
</P>
<P>
 Only seven of her letters exist; she kept no diary. Much of her life just 
appeared, often in flatteringly colored fashion, on the pages of the New York 
World or the Journal. So Kroeger works to find the private Bly in the public 
one: 
</P>
<P>
 In Bly's early arguments pleading understanding for struggling women, she 
demands, "If sin in the form of a man comes forward with a wily smile and says, 
fear no more, your debts shall be paid, she cannot let her children freeze or 
starve, and so falls. Well, who shall blame her?" 
</P>
<P>
 In such frankness, Kroeger finds Bly's feelings about a father who died, 
leaving his family inadequately provided for, about a mother who could never 
manage her own life and remarried a drunken lout, a ne'er-do-well brother who 
lived on his sister's industry (and who, gallingly, was once credited with 
writing her stories). 
</P>
<P>
 Bly had perhaps one failed romance, perhaps two. In her own stories and in her 
one truly bad novel, she was always the queen of hearts. She married at 30 a 
man of 70, an industrialist whose family was against the marriage, and when it 
looked as if it might not last -- he sent a servant to follow Bly, and she 
turned the man in to police -- Bly went back to work. 
</P>
<P>
 The marriage did last, for 10 years, and when Edward Seaman died, Bly ran his 
ironworks with profitable bravado. She learned every machine in the factory, 
held 25 industrial patents and extended to her 1,500 employees the benefits she 
had seen missing in the labor turbulence she once covered -- showers, 
recreation, hospital care. 
</P>
<P>
 What broke Bly was not business, but embezzlement and betrayal, first by 
trusted employees who spent her thousands on campaign contributions and even a 
yacht, and later by some of her own family. "I cannot blame myself enough for 
not having learned banking methods and commercial accounting . . . ," she 
lamented. 
</P>
<P>
 Even World War I looked more peaceful than the New York courts. Bly spent 
virtually the entire war in Austria, writing about Austrians' suffering as a 
universal, even after America entered the war on the other side. Cut off from 
Allied information, she finally abandoned her correspondent role to plead 
Austria's cause, at the end of the war warning Woodrow Wilson by a letter to 
the Democratic Party chairman that "hunger breeds Bolschewismus (Bolshevism)." 
</P>
<P>
 And back in New York, she started over, yet again, in her 50s, with the only 
successful column she ever wrote, an advice feature that became so influential 
that desperate women abandoned their babies with instructions to give them to 
Nellie Bly. Skirting the authorities with her usual impatience, she arranged 
adoptions and foster care, help to homeless boys and unwed mothers. Her last 
column ran the day she was hospitalized with the heart disease and 
bronchopneumonia that would kill her at age 57. 
</P>
<P>
 So dense is this book that even I, an acolyte, found myself nodding over the 
detailed bankruptcy court sessions. And yet what I so much wanted to read -- 
one or two complete Nellie Bly stories, as overwritten and quaint as they might 
be -- I did not get. 
</P>
<P>
 Most poignant were two enduring echoes of Bly's voice, her pained rejoinder to 
a critic and her wistful query to the world. They mark how small, in truth, are 
the years between her life and mine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Century after century," she told a male journalist who mocked some feminist 
idea of hers, "you men have been jeering, imprisoning, burning, scoffing (at) 
every person who came forward with a new idea." 
</P>
<P>
 And then, in 1912, eight years before women could vote and a quarter-hour 
before Woodrow Wilson was sworn in as president, she charmed a guard into 
letting her stand on the empty swearing-in platform. "Will you and I," she 
wrote later, "ever see a woman stand there and take the oath of office?"

THREE ON THE TOWN: SELDOM-SEEN L.A. SIGHTS; LOOKING FOR STARS IN ALL THE WRONG 
PLACES, OR THIS LITTLE CELEBRITY WENT TO MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Wanda Coleman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1950s L.A., it was our family duty to show visiting kin the stellar parts 
of town. Mom and Pop would don Sunday best for the obligatory tour of 
Hollywood, stopping for the mandatory comparison of hand, foot and hoof prints 
at Grauman's Chinese Theatre, then heading into the hills to see the homes of 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't unusual to catch celebrities at home, like the time Uncle Ben and 
his bride not only got to eyeball the infamous piano-shaped pool but exchanged 
gracious small talk with Liberace. Or to discover a celeb or two chowing down 
at the next table, like the time my parents found themselves ogling the Mills 
Brothers over fried chicken and mashed potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 But these days, try and find a real, live celebrity when you need one. 
Increasingly rare glimpses are more apt to occur in a highly ordinary context, 
the unglamorous realm of daily commerce: 
</P>
<P>
 * I gasp over my Hilton dinner roll and stare at Myrna Loy and Gloria Swanson 
seated at the next table. I squeeze in as others ring the table and join the 
chirping about Loy and William Powell in those charming old "Thin Man" movies 
and Swanson as the immortal Norma Desmond in "Sunset Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
 * Hurrying to lunch in Beverly Hills, I see a horror-film legend heading 
toward me. I'm carrying only a coin purse, so an autograph is out. A simple 
greeting will have to do. "Hello, Vincent Price," I say softly as we pass. My 
words startle him. He walks against the light into traffic as brakes and 
onlookers screech. 
</P>
<P>
 * Impatient, I cut off the slow-moving luxury car on Beverly Boulevard, 
cursing the driver to an eternity of right lanes. In the rearview mirror, I 
recognize Charles Nelson Reilly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Racing along Sunset, I'm inched over by a huge red Cadillac convertible, 
David Carradine behind the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 * Late to a Westside social event, I bump the fender of a Rolls-Royce, 
narrowly beating it to a convenient parking space. Dionne Warwick steps out to 
check for damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * As I board the bus in front of Brentano's, a white-haired, ruddy-faced man, 
clutching a leather writing caddy, excuses himself as he jostles by. It's 
science-fiction author Ray Bradbury. 
</P>
<P>
 * I'm entering the lobby of the Taft Building in Hollywood when the blur I 
recognize as Karl Malden pushes past. 
</P>
<P>
 * As I exit the City Hall elevator, I hear the clatter of heels and hold the 
doors. Barbara Bain and a companion leap inside, disappearing as the doors snap 
shut. 
</P>
<P>
 Less elusive than personalities, places are more reliable fare. Visiting kith 
are as interested in famous Southern California sites as in sightings of the 
rich and famous. The Watts Towers, the Rose Bowl, Universal's CityWalk, the 
Faith Dome and the Crystal Cathedral rank high on a list that also includes 
notorious landmarks, like the Ambassador Hotel, where Robert F. Kennedy was 
assassinated, the Manson ranch, Marilyn Monroe's death house, Sal Mineo's 
Holloway Drive apartment and, more recently, the Florence-and-Normandie riot 
flash point, the nightspot where River Phoenix collapsed and the Northridge 
earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 But when disappointed glitter-seeking cousins complain about the tarnish, we 
gently explain that even with paparazzo determination, they'll be lucky to see 
one star, let alone two. What the folk from back home reluctantly realize is 
that it's easier to spot a star among the veggies at Pavilions than up on 
Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 * At Big & Tall Books/Cafe, Bill Murray slips in to peruse the stacks. My 
14-year-old seizes the opportunity to tell him the latest joke making the 
junior high rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Speeding down Gower toward Astro's, on my way to score a burger, I spot 
Henry Winkler exiting the Paramount lot. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Whatever you do, don't ask him about his days as Bud," the Valley party 
hostess cautions before introducing me to Billy Gray, formerly of "Father Knows 
Best." "Talk to him the way you'd talk to the average person."

 FLAT ROCK JOURNAL: A Day in the Missouri Ozarks by Ken Carey ( Harper San 
Francisco: $18; 224 pp.) Ken Carey communicates intimately with the trees and 
animals sharing his eighty acres in the Missouri Ozarks.A pine tree provides a 
vision of loggers, a raven explains bird consciousness. For the skeptics among 
us, much of "Flat Rock Journal," Carey's chronicles of the extreme joys and 
hardships of rural life, may seem a little hundy-gundy. But for those 
interested in the spiritual aspects of nature, this book is a real find. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Carey's modesty, kindness and intelligence emanate so gracefully from 
every page that even if you don't believe all of what he says, there is still a 
great deal to be learned from the man himself. And Carey can write. "The sun 
will not shine again at this angle until this precise minute of the hour one 
year from today. But conditions that day are not likely to duplicate this same 
amount of humidity, this same cloud pattern or air temperature. This is the 
first time I have walked this path, the first time I have seen these trees." 
</P>
<P>
 Another wonderful aspect "Flat Rock Journal" is the surprising humor. In one 
section Carey, having been in the woods for a long time, absent-mindedly 
sharpens his chain saw on a public bus. State troopers are called. In another 
chapter that works beautifully as its own set piece, he whistles along with 
singing frogs in the hopes of expanding their musical capability. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of "Flat Rock Journal," is one man's reverence for the miraculous 
nature of life, a reverence that flows as sweet and clear as the Ozark spring 
water he so lovingly describes.

 THE TRACKS OF ANGELS by Kelly Dwyer (G. P. Putnam's Sons: $22.95, 272 pp.) 
Although many first novels have essentially the same plot (young alienated 
person comes of age and reconciles with his or her painful past) perhaps it is 
not a negative thing.Perhaps a lot of writers need to tell that story before 
being able to access the other riches buried underneath their young alienated 
self. "The Tracks of Angels," has many strengths. Dwyer's style is engaging. 
She has an eye for the quirky detail, creates real likable characters, and 
handles an enormous issue without becoming polemical. Laura, the narrator, 
seems to have been through more than her share of bad luck, yet somehow never 
lapses into self pity. This is writing you can trust.

 LISTENING TO OURSELVES: Stories From The Sound of Writing edited by Alan 
Cheuse and Caroline Marshall (Anchor Books: $12; 296 pp.) Short story 
anthologies like car dashboards are not always built with the user in mind.On 
the surface, putting together a selection of pieces read on the popular NPR 
show, "The Sound of Writing," is a great idea, and the resulting anthology, 
"Listening To Ourselves," does in many respects work well. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every piece is by an established author and care is taken to properly 
represent a variety of ethnic groups. In addition, at least a third of these 
stories are quite wonderful. Writers such as Ann Beattie, Tobias Wolff, Rick 
Bass, Mona Simpson, and Jayne Anne Phillips seldom let you down, and their 
offerings here are no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 However, "Listening To Ourselves," has problems many people reading it cover 
to cover may experience. Since these stories were originally selected to 
conform to a prearranged time slot, every one of them is almost exactly the 
same length -- about seven pages. Rhythms become predictable, and the stories 
themselves blend together as if you were looking through pictures in a 
stranger's yearbook. This is exacerbated by the actual content. With the 
exception of John Edgar Wideman's brilliant, impressionistic "Newborn Thrown In 
Trash And Dies," all the stories seem vaguely alike. Literary yet safe. Clean. 
Unambiguous. The best way to read this anthology is little by little, perhaps 
in conjunction with other books. Expect a trip, but not a journey.

 THE WATERS OF THIRST by Adam Mars-Jones (Alfred A. Knopf: $20; 182 pp.) Food, 
motorcycle riders, and a porn star are constant obsessions for William, the 
narrator of Adam Mars-Jones' novel, "The Waters of Thirst."William tells his 
story in a sad, smart monologue that has no actual scenes, chapter breaks or 
clear explanation of how much time passes from beginning to end. He is just 
there. As a result, the whole book feels motionless, but in an oddly 
captivating way like the light in a good painting. 
</P>
<P>
 At times William comes across less than sympathetic. He has a life threatening 
disease, which is awful, but the indulgence it brings out in him can be even 
worse. Terry, William's longtime lover (both are men) handles William's 
problems with a lot of patience though we never see his character very clearly. 
"The Waters of Thirst" is William's show. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, William does an unbelievably selfish act that involves a dog 
belonging to him and Terry. One may wish for the book's culmination to be 
presented a little less ambiguously -- this reviewer had to read the section 
three times before understanding exactly what had transpired. But, aside from 
that, Mars-Jones has written a compelling and singular novel.

 THE DISNEY POSTER: The Animated Film Classics from Mickey Mouse to Aladdin by 
Jim Fanning (Hyperion: $35.; 96 pp.) . This bright, colorful volume celebrates 
the artwork created to advertise the Disney shorts and features. As the 
illustrations were not done by the animators, it's interesting to observe the 
differences in the way the characters are drawn. The chapters on Mickey, Donald 
and Goofy reveal how the look of those popular icons changed over the decades. 
Fanning's cheerful, superficial survey will delight Disney fans and Disneyana 
collectors. Charles Solomon

 MIRACLE IN EAST HARLEM: The Fight for Choice in Public Education by Seymour 
Fliegel with James Macguire (Times Books: $23; 244 pp.). In 1973 New York's 
Public School District Four in East Harlem ranked at or near the bottom of 
almost every possible list. Reading and math achievement, attendance, drop-out 
rate and number of college bound students. By 1987 all that had dramatically 
changed. District Four rose from 32nd (out of 32) to 15th place among the 
city's school districts surpassing more affluent areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Miracle in East Harlem" by Seymour Fliegel, is the story of how that 
happened. Fliegel, who is a former deputy superintendent of District Four, has 
a simple philosophy. First, start a variety of small, innovative alternative 
schools each one addressing a particular need within the neighborhood. Then, 
allow parents and their children to decide for themselves which school they 
want to attend instead of automatically assigning students to the school 
nearest their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Fliegel, along with a group of dedicated teachers and 
administrators, succeeded is nothing short of astounding. The amount of 
bureaucracy, small-mindedness and downright malevolence District Four faced 
from The Board of Education will amaze even hardened cynics. Yet, for the most 
part, District Four prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult to find fault with a book that has such a worthy cause. 
Fliegel's ideas are important and should be discussed in school districts 
across the country. However, "Miracle in East Harlem," has one enormous 
drawback which can not be ignored: It's boring. The hundreds of names, 
statistics and long-winded explanations of school policy might flow a little 
easier if they were surrounded by vibrant writing. Instead, the style is flat 
and airless. This is sad in such an important book.

IMMATERIAL GIRL; MY LIVES, BY ROSEANNE ARNOLD (BALLANTINE BOOKS: $23; 146 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Leah Rozen, Leah Rozen is an associate editor at People magazine in New York 
and a fan of Roseanne. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tired but true cliche: You cannot judge a book by its cover. Take, for 
example, the steamy dust jacket on "My Lives," Roseanne Arnold's second 
autobiography. (Her first, "Roseanne: My Life as a Woman," was published by 
Harper & Row in 1989.) It features Arnold swooning in the arms of her husband, 
Tom, both of them garbed in 18th-Century duds and making like the hero and 
heroine of a bodice-ripping romance. "My Lives," however, is anything but a 
conventional love story. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the book does tell the story of Roseanne's bumpy romance with Tom, an 
ardor complicated by the fact that she already had a husband and three 
children, and Tom was jamming half an ounce of coke up his nose daily and 
peddling the details of their affair to the National Enquirer, her real mission 
here is to tell how child abuse wrecked her life and how, by speaking out 
against it now, she is struggling to overcome it. Arnold wants us to know that 
despite being the star and producer of her own hit TV sitcom, "Roseanne," and 
making gadzillions of dollars, she is in a constant state of emotional chaos, 
for which she blames parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Her story, if it's true, is shocking. She claims that both of her parents 
sexually abused her. Her father, she says, routinely played with himself while 
watching television. Over the years, he molested her, her younger sister, and, 
more recently, one of Arnold's teen-age daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 She accuses her mother of mental cruelty, of threatening her with a knife and 
of beating her. (Her parents have denied these charges.) Arnold says the 
lingering effects of the abuse have made her an emotional mess. "Every day I 
teeter on a razor blade," she writes. 
</P>
<P>
 "My Lives" may be what the French call a crie de coeur (cry of the heart), but 
it is also a crie de spleen. Arnold is out to settle old scores and woe be unto 
those who have offended her. She is ruthless about her parents and nearly as 
nasty about her siblings, whom she portrays as money-sucking hangers-on. "I 
have had no contact with my family for almost four years now," writes Arnold, 
"an these four years have been the most productive, healing, and happy years of 
my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Others whom Arnold is out to slash and burn include Matt Williams, the 
original creator of "Roseanne," whom she dismisses as a "hack son of a bitch . 
. . ," and her ex-husband, Bill Pentland, whom she disses for his drinking and 
for being "dishonest, scheming, disloyal, and as big a coward that ever painted 
his ass black to hide in the night. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold, both of TV and here, is an overwhelming and occasionally mesmerizing 
combination of smart and gross. She revels in bringing to television a truly 
subversive situation comedy in which a feminist agenda co-exists with a fierce 
working-class pride, but takes equal delight in wallowing in real life in 
in-your-face tackiness, profanity, tattoos and bad grammar. "Hey, class is for 
the schmucks who take life as a spectator sport anyway, so who needs it?" she 
writes. "Gimme pink and lime green a splatter pattern in the Formica, fat 
neckties, an honest belch, and a one-note cheek samba any day." 
</P>
<P>
 "My Lives" may be a book that Arnold had to write, but it is not one that her 
many fans necessarily have to read. Much of what she reveals here -- she had 
sex for money, she smoked pot daily, she short-changed customers during her 
days as a waitress -- she has already blabbed about on talk shows or in 
magazine interviews. The rest is often either so caustic or self-indulgent that 
you'd rather not know it anyway. I mean, c'mon, does anyone really need a 
20-page explanation about why Roseanne sang the national anthem off key? 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Hayes, who lived into her 90s, wrote three sets of memoirs over the last 
several decades of her life. Only by the third book, written just a few years 
before her death, was she able to admit in print that her husband, playwright 
Charles MacArthur, had been an alcoholic and had spent a decade, essentially, 
drinking himself to death following the untimely death of their daughter. What, 
one wonders after reading Arnold's latest volume, can she possibly be holding 
back for her third?

 ALWAYS RUNNING: La Vida Loca: Gang Days in L.A. by Luis J. Rodriguez 
(Touchstone: $10; 260 pp.). A gangbanger at 12, Rodriguez presents a bitter 
portrait of the poverty, violence and despair that blight many Southern 
California neighborhoods.The emptiness he sought to escape in dangerous 
adventures preyed on his soul, until "I arrived at a point which alarmed even 
me, where I had no desire for the internal night, the buoyancy of letting go, 
the bliss of the void. I required more, a discipline as bulwark within which to 
hold all I valued, a shield against the onslaught." This discipline has been 
expressed through his writing and his work as a peacemaker among inner-city 
gangs, an ongoing memorial to the fallen homeboys he mourns.

 UNDER THE BLACK FLAG by Erik Christian Haugaard (Roberts Rinehart: $8.95; 163 
pp., paperback original). An award-winning juvenile author, Erik Haugaard 
presents the adventures of William Bernard, a teen-ager traveling to England 
from his father's plantation in Jamaica, who is kidnaped by the infamous 
Blackbeard. Although he spins an exciting yarn, Haugaard never glamorizes the 
pirates. As Blackbeard's de facto cabin boy, William has ample opportunity to 
observe their cruelty and the miserable conditions aboard a 17th-Century 
sailing ship. Informative but never didactic, "Flag" will claim the attention 
of any young readers.

 A SENSE OF MISSION: Historic Churches of the Southwest text by Thomas A. 
Drain, photographs by David Wakely (Chronicle: $18.95; 132 pp., paperback 
original). Wakely's luminous photographs and Drain's thoughtful text stress 
that the missions in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas represent a 
fusion of Spanish, Moorish and Pueblo traditions in architecture and 
decoration. The stark white facade of San Jose'??? De Laguna in New Mexico 
conceals flamboyant wall paintings that recall Pueblo pottery; Nuestra Senora 
de la Purisima Conception typifies the colonial baroque style -- except for the 
traditional Mexican image of a mysterious face peering out of the rising sun. 
This emphasis on cultural cross-pollination makes "A Sense of Mission" an 
enriching guide book.

 THE INDEX OF LEADING CULTURAL INDICATORS: Facts and Figures on the State of 
American Society by William J. Bennett (Touchstone: $8.95; 138 pp., paperback 
original). Figures may not lie, but they can be juggled, and William Bennett 
handles statistics as skillfully as a performer on the Venice boardwalk.He 
cites the high rates of abortion and teen-age pregnancy in America, but fails 
to correlate those figures with a dearth of family planning information. He 
claims, "Armed citizens defend their lives or property with firearms against 
criminals approximately 1 million times a year," but omits the number of 
murders committed by family members in gun-owning households. Bennett sets the 
tone for this sermon to the choir when he decries the failure of Americans to 
provide moral education for the young -- ignoring the examples set by the 
amoral policies of the administrations he served.

 KING OF THE CATS: The Life and Times of Adam Clayton Powell Jr. by Wil Haygood 
(Houghton Mifflin: $14.95; 476 pp., illustrated). In this vivid biography, 
Boston Globe correspondent Wil Haygood portrays the controversial Harlem 
congressman as a quintessential politician: Even as a college student, he 
manifested the "cunning, wit, arrogance, and intelligence" that would fuel both 
his rise and fall. Haygood describes Powell as calculating, self-serving and 
vain, but recognizes his importance as a legislator. Powell authored and/or 
helped to pass an impressive number of education, labor, anti-poverty and civil 
rights bills that benefited his constituents and many others. Tragically, his 
vanity prevented him from recognizing the hatred he engendered among his 
colleagues and the changing attitudes in Congress and America during the '60s.

 LOVERS' CHOICE by Becky Birtha (Seal Press: $10.95; 152 pp.). Although many of 
Birtha's stories involve lesbians dealing with questions of commitment, her 
most effective writing probes the complex feelings African American women share 
with their female relatives.In "Baby Town," a little girl accompanies her 
mother, aunt and sister to a cemetery and experiences the first chilling 
intimations of her own mortality; "Johnnieruth" captures the impatience of an 
adolescent girl eager to explore the possibilities that lie beyond the familiar 
blocks where her mother insists she remain.

 THE CABIN: Reminiscence and Diversions by David Mahmet (Vintage: $10; 157 pp.) 
. Mahmet's episodic memoirs resemble a succession of scenes illuminated by an 
erratic strobe light: A single moment appears in harsh focus, then vanishes. A 
mundane dining room table triggers memories of his parents' emotional 
grandstanding and how they tyrannized his sister; a pleasant house in Vermont 
leads to speculations about the existence of neighborhood ghosts. The title 
essay is an affectionate portrait of the Pulitzer Prize winner's cozily 
disordered sanctum sanctorum.

A CHURCH WITHOUT SPIRITUALITY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Novelist Gabrielle Donnelly's favorable review (Feb. 13) of A. N. Wilson's 
"The Vicar of Sorrows" was marred by an unfair -- and surprisingly nasty-toned 
-- dismissal of the entire Anglican tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 She first recycles the false and worn out jibe that the Church of England was 
"originally founded by Henry VIII." Of course, it was not. He merely separated 
the English church from Roman jurisdiction. The canon law term "Anglican 
Church" long antedated the Reformation era, and serious tensions between 
England and Rome had been growing since the 13th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 She goes on to claim, astonishingly, Anglicanism is "lacking" in any "deep 
pull of spirituality" within its own structure, and has therefore been unable 
to produce any "truly religious adult novel set in the Church of England." 
</P>
<P>
 Really? I could not believe that I was reading this in the pages of the Sunday 
Times in the 1990s. This is the sort of freewheeling and ignorant vilification 
that we thought -- or at least hoped -- was passe in an Ecumenical Age. Local 
Episcopalians who saw the review might well be too "Anglican," too tastefully 
"restrained," to reply. But something really ought to be said for the record. 
I'm not an Anglican. I am a member of the Roman Church and an academic 
historian of Christian thought. And I am happy to reply -- if no one else does. 
</P>
<P>
 Any religious tradition which has produced and retained a Richard Hooker, a 
Lancelot Andrews, a John Keble, an F. D. Maurice, a William Temple in theology; 
a John Donne, a George Herbert, a T. S. Eliot in poetry; an Anthony Trollope, a 
Dorothy Sayers, a Charles Williams as fully adult novelists and essayists -- 
that tradition has nothing to be ashamed of "spiritually." Donnelly should try 
to get a clearer-eyed view of Anglicanism and the corpus of Anglican writing 
before she talks about them again. 
</P>

 CHARLES STINSON, LOS ANGELES A WOMAN CALLED ERROL 
</P>
<P>
 I am interested to note that Dick Roraback, in his "In Brief" review of "The 
Lives of Beryl Markham," by Errol Trzebinski (Feb. 20), refers to the author as 
"he." (He contends that Markham's book was ghosted by then-husband, Raoul 
Schumacher, a ghost writer by trade.") 
</P>
<P>
 While the contention is correct, I wonder, nevertheless, if Roraback actually 
read the book, or even looked at the dust jacket. Errol Trzebinski, the "he" 
that Roraback notes, is a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, Raoul Schumacher was my uncle. 
</P>
<P>
 BETTY JO RAVITZ, SAN PEDRO MISSING THE BIG PICTURE 
</P>
<P>
 In response to Naomi Wolf's "Women, Money and Power" (Feb. 6); she seems to be 
missing the big picture. This capitalist system in which we live is oppressive 
and by its very nature breeds inequality. Why would I, as a feminist/humanist, 
want to take power in such a system? Does Wolf hate power simply because she 
doesn't have it? I should hope not. We, women and men, need to realize that 
power is not something we want to take but something we want to destroy in 
order to put equality in its place.

 Country line dancing is hot, hot, hot. From Santa Monica to San Dimas, 
cowfolk, real and faux, are pulling on their new blue jeans and lining up to 
Tush Push as precisely as a country chorus line. But many of the folks who make 
the music that gets the feet stomping are not thrilled. Country musicians call 
it everything from "Ken and Barbie country" (Jim Goodall of the Jon Wayne band) 
to "solo disco" (singer Dale Watson). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as if a band onstage is just a jukebox for the dancers. It kills any 
semblance of music as an art form and strips away any personal statement," says 
Chris Hillman, who fronts the Desert Rose Band. "It's also very Teutonic and 
militaristic. It's lining up like a bunch of Nazi storm troopers, everybody 
lifting up their legs at the same time -- like marching to a Nuremberg rally." 
</P>

 Some musicians may hate the trend, but country's new popularity has produced 
hordes of proselytes who want their music line-dance ready. Legend among 
musicians is last year's culture clash at In Cahoots, a Glendale club that was 
briefly home to Ronnie Mack's Barn Dance. Mack's event was a weekly showcase of 
traditional country and rockabilly; In Cahoots is a line-dancing bastion. One 
night, Mack recounts, a man in a white Garth Brooks hat charged the stage and 
yelled at the Elvis-style cowfolk onstage: "We don't want your f - - - - - - 
music! Play 'Boot, Scoot and Boogie!' " Audiences at In Cahoots, Mack has said, 
"didn't want to hear anything that has to do with traditional roots, only 
what's on the charts these days. Country music did not start with Garth 
Brooks." The Barn Dance is now back at its old home, the Palomino. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Watson, a Merle Haggard-style cowboy from Pasadena, Tex., who's 
been known to stop the music if folks request the Walkin' Wazee, Slappin' 
Leather or other line dances. "I didn't spend 20 years at this to be a 
choreographer," Watson says. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's no shortage of people who are churning out dance tunes. Dwight 
Yoakam, who, according to friends, once played "Tulsa Time" with a bluegrass 
beat to foil line dancers, is apparently singing a different tune these days, 
with a dance mix of his hit "Fast as You." Yoakam declined to comment. Judy

LET YOUR FINGERS DO THE READING, TOO

<P>
 I am a book catalogue addict. 
</P>
<P>
 It started more than 20 years ago, back in high school, when I saw an inviting 
ad in the newspaper for the Quality Paperback Book Club: "Three books, three 
bucks." I was hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I find shopping for books by mail more enjoyable and more convenient than 
wandering the aisles of chain bookstores, which have become increasingly 
uniform in the titles and selections they offer, not to mention the annoying 
fact that many are now installing expresso bars. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several well-known book clubs, most notably the Book-of-the-Month 
Club and the History Book Club, as well as book clubs for mystery lovers and 
people who love to cook. But there are also a handful of specialty and literary 
book clubs and catalogues that cater to a growing number of discerning readers 
who are not slaves to the bestseller lists. These are run by people who 
actually read and often review the books they sell. 
</P>
<P>
 A Common Reader, which publishes a 1,000-title catalogue every month, is like 
browsing through a writer's library. Books are offered under such topics as 
"Storytelling," "Pastimes," "Critics & Curmudgeons" as well as special sections 
featuring authors like Anthony Trollope, M.F.K. Fisher and Patrick O'Brian. "We 
don't offer John Grisham novels or Kitty Kelly biographies," laughs Jim 
Meagher, a former Boston lawyer who now edits and writes A Common Reader's 
catalogue. "We try to find a common ground between our own enthusiams and what 
would interest other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Daedalus offers high-quality remainders and specializes in contemporary 
fiction. The catalogue, published seven times a year, carries titles ranging 
Darryl Pinckney's "High Cotton" ($4.98) to a 24-volume Chieftan goatskin-bound 
Wessex Edition of the work of Thomas Hardy (regularly $3,000, but only $1,000 
through Daedalus). The Hardy sold out. "We decided there was a definite niche 
for literary remainders," explains Daedalus vice president Helaine Harris, who 
says that the catalogue has had 350,000 customers. "People trust us because we 
buy books of lasting value." 
</P>
<P>
 In a society where literature is becoming just another entertainment product 
the specialty book clubs and catalogues are a bridge to a place where serious 
reading still matters. They also can help curious readers, by virtue of the 
short but literate reviews often written by the catalogue's editors, discover 
books that might be overlooked on a store's crowded shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Below is a list of book clubs and book catalogues with information on how to 
contact them to get on their mailing lists. 
</P>
<P>
 A Common Reader, 141 Tomkins Ave., Pleasantville, N.Y. 10570. Order toll free 
(800) 832-7323. Fax (914) 747-0778. Catalogue issued monthly, containing about 
1,000 titles. Excellent selection over a wide range of categories, including 
fiction, belles lettres, biography. Not a discount service, but the 
discriminating selection is worth the price. 
</P>
<P>
 Daedalus Books, P.O. Box 9132, Hyattsville, Md. 20781-0932. Order toll free 
(800) 395-2665. Fax (800) 866-5578. Formerly heavy on academic titles, Daedalus 
is now the leading catalogue for high-quality contemporary fiction at a 
discount price. Also a good selection of children's books and gardening books, 
biography and cultural history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reader's Subscription, Dept. MGM, Delran, N.J. 08370. Fax (609) 786-3439. 
TRS has been around for a long time and still offers one of the smartest 
selections in nonfiction books among the catalogue sellers. Buyers earn bonus 
points that provide for steep discounts on some orders. In addition, TRS sells 
all the titles currently published by the Library of America, reprints of 
classic American literature. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scholar's Bookshelf, 110 Melrich Road, Cranbury, N.J., 08512. A thick 
catalogue of titles, mostly from the academic and university presses. Most of 
the titles are sold at a discount. There are some real finds -- like the 
six-volume Anchor Bible Dictionary -- but read the catalogue carefully. A wide 
selection of military and world history titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Laissez Faire Books, 938 Howard St., No. 202, San Francisco, Calif. 94103. 
Order toll-free (800) 326-0996. A book catalogue with a Libertarian bent, 
Laissez Faire Books nonetheless offers a good selection of classical texts in 
political philosophy and economics, from H. L. Mencken to Ayn Rand and Lord 
Acton. John Lippman

PALM LATITUDES: THE WORD; TWO ANGRY MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R. Daniel Foster 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It may not be on a par with Hedda and Louella, but a rivalry between two local 
gay 'zines has become so heated that it's ending up in court. Planet Homo and 
Spunk, two gossip-driven guides to L.A.'s underground that have livened up the 
gay magazine scene, are suing each other -- on charges ranging from breach of 
contract to defamation. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul West, a former ad rep, launched Planet Homo in 1992, later selling the 
publication for $50,000 to Peter Deep, owner of the Zone, a club for gay men. 
Within months, West started Spunk, which, like PH, offers up celebrity 
interviews and gossip -- including outing innuendoes -- on who's who at 
underground clubs and news and features on gay culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Deep stopped payments on PH six months after signing the contract, claiming 
that Spunk was in violation of a non-competition clause. West sued Deep for 
non-payment and Deep cross-complained, accusing West of taking copies of PH out 
of news racks and duping advertisers into believing PH had gone out of 
business. West denies the charges. The whole mess will soon be in the hands of 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The feud found its way into print, with Spunk making ad hominem attacks on 
Deep, with puns on his name and vituperative critiques of his publication. And 
PH has made plenty of catty counter-comments of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jabs we've printed about each other get people reading the publications," 
says West. "But now it's gone from gossip to something that's at stake." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bricker, owner of the ad firm McMan & Tate, which does ads for both mags, 
says "Peter and Paul were friends, worked together and had admiration for each 
other. That's probably why they hate each other so much now." 
</P>
<P>
 West says he never befriended Deep, but as one of the many lawyers involved in 
the case has commented: "Who cares? It's all ego." R. Daniel Foster

LETTERS ; TAX ON BATTERIES WOULD SNARL ELECTRIC CAR PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read with interest Robert A. Rosenblatt's Feb. 2 article ("New Juice for 
Electric Cars") regarding the vote by eastern states to endorse in principal 
the stringent California-style vehicle-emissions rules that are supported by 
environmentalists nationwide. The irony is that these same environmentalists 
are supporting a tax on lead-acid batteries -- the very energy source that will 
power no-emission electric vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Lead-acid batteries are increasingly viewed as the most viable power source 
for electric vehicles because they are the most readily available, safe and 
reliable battery technology. The bill, which calls for a 45-cents-per-pound tax 
on lead, would increase the cost of batteries for electric vehicles 
significantly. If passed, the tax will price electric vehicle technology out of 
the range of virtually all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally ironic is the fact that recycling remains the environmental 
community's battle cry, yet lead-acid batteries are the most recycled commodity 
in the United States, at more than 90% annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Tough rules are only one key element in improving our environment. Feasibility 
and fairness should be two others.

 I notice that it is "business as usual" in the Justice Department ("State Near 
Bottom of Barrel of Wine Grape Scandal," Jan. 30). 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that Fred T. Franzia, co-founder and president of Bronco Wine Co., 
will have the means to buy his way out of prison. Anyone who doesn't have the 
money to bribe the government would be spending time in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 In view of what I read concerning the character and attitude of Franzia, a few 
years in prison might teach him honesty and humility. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidence? It looks like the racketeers over here are copycats of their 
"cousins" in Italy (1986 wine scandal there).

 I hope the judge in the Franzia sentencing won't be bought.

THE AMERICAN FACTOR; ISRAEL STRUGGLES TO COPE WITH A VIOLENT RADICAL FRINGE 
FROM THE U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Yossi Melman, Yossi Melman, an Israeli journalist, is the co-author of 
Friends in Deed: Inside the U.S.-Israeli Alliance, due out next month from 
Hyperion. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. Baruch Goldstein was not an exception. The Jewish settler who 
systematically massacred more than 40 Palestinians as they prayed at the Cave 
of the Patriarchs in Hebron was preceded by Elliot Goodman and Craig Laitner. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1982, Goodman, of Tenefly, N.J., stormed into the El Omar mosque on 
Mount Temple in Jerusalem and fired into a Palestinian crowd. Miraculously, 
"only" two worshipers were killed and 11 wounded. Two years later, Laitner and 
three colleagues, all from Jewish neighborhoods in New York, opened fire on a 
bus carrying Palestinian workers near the same city. Five were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli authorities treated both men harshly. Goodman was sentenced to 
life. Laitner, who escaped to the United States but was later extradited, was 
convicted by an Israeli court and sentenced to several years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, successive Israeli governments, including the present one, regarded 
these incidents as isolated, refusing to admit they were products of a larger 
psychological environment -- the Jewish settlers' movement that had nourished 
Palestinian hatred. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli government is now paying the price of this accommodating attitude 
toward Jewish extremism. The Goldstein massacre has temporarily stalled peace 
talks between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel. Unrest in the 
occupied territories is on the rise. And Jewish settlers are resisting the 
government's efforts to disarm the most violent among them. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein's attack shares much in common with the preceding two. The 
perpetrators wore, for disguise, Israeli army uniforms and used automatic 
rifles originally issued by the army for self-defense. They were all settlers 
on the West Bank. All were American Jews who had emigrated to Israel. And all 
drew their inspiration from the Kach movement and its leader, Meir Kahane. 
</P>
<P>
 Kach, which means "this is the way" or "thus" in Hebrew, is another Israeli 
import from the United States. It was founded, in 1973, by Kahane, who first 
gained prominence in America when he established the Jewish Defense League in 
the late 1960s. When tensions increased between blacks and Jews in Queens and 
Brooklyn, Kahane and his small group of followers distributed weapons to Jews 
and organized armed patrols to protect them. His slogan was "Never Again." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, however, the JDL evolved into a group of Jewish vigilantes and thugs who 
used guns, explosives and threats of violence against anyone they considered an 
enemy of Jews, including liberal Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 A growing embarrassment to the Jewish mainstream Establishment and to U.S. 
law-enforcement agencies, Kahane was persuaded to emigrate to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 In Israel, Kahane and his followers received a mixed reception. The majority 
of Israelis abhorred Kahane's politics of racism. Several right-wing 
politicians, however, found his preaching useful, even enticing. Unconfirmed 
reports tied right-wing Israeli businessmen -- including Yitzhak Shamir before 
he became prime minister -- to efforts to smuggle arms to Kahane's U.S.-based 
JDL. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kahane carried out violent acts against Arabs, he was arrested; some Kach 
members were placed under police surveillance. Yet, time and again, he was 
released and the surveillance was soon lifted. This allowed him to fuel 
tensions by using what many Israelis regarded as "American-made" stunts. 
</P>
<P>
 The population of Israel's expatriate American community is estimated to be 
60,000 -- barely 1.5% of the country's 4.4 million Jews. The Russian, Moroccan, 
Romanian, Iraqi, Polish and Argentine Jewish communities settled since 
independence in 1948 are far larger. Yet, the influence of American Jews on 
Israeli society is far greater. 
</P>
<P>
 They can be found in all walks of Israeli life -- in government, the army, 
business, the professions. Many are leading artists and writers. Yet, a 
substantial number of them identify with the political radicalism and religious 
militancy found on the fringe of Israel's politics, particularly on the West 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the vast majority of the 120,000 Jews who live in the 144 rural 
and urban communities on the West Bank are law-abiding citizens. Most are 
secular Israelis drawn to the region by subsidized housing and by a desire to 
improve their quality of life. Only a relatively small minority -- no more than 
10,000 -- firmly embraces an uncompromising nationalism laced with the 
religious conviction that this land was promised by God to Abraham and his 
offspring. Half are of American origin. 
</P>
<P>
 True, when Kahane and his followers arrived in Israel in 1972, they found an 
environment already infected by the nationalist virus, one fed by years of 
Palestinian terrorism and the Arabs' rejection of the right of Israel to exist. 
Yet, they brought with them ideas, deeply rooted in American culture, that 
helped produce a virulent strain of nationalism -- a readiness to resort to 
political violence, trigger-happiness, vigilantism. All are imbrued with the 
emotions of the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Israelis are taught that the establishment of Israel was the answer to 
the Holocaust, the ultimate guarantee that it would never happen again. But for 
the average young or middle-age American Jew, the Holocaust is a historic 
reality, a constant reminder of the threats to Israel's existence and to Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Using American methods, Kahane packaged his message of hatred of Arabs in 
sound bites for television. He modeled his tactics after the civil-rights 
marches, leading his supporters into the heart of Arab towns and villages, 
where he called for the expulsion of Arabs. He always made sure that TV cameras 
were in tow. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his strong American accent was grating to Israeli ears and his body 
language suggestive of a disturbed personality, some young Israelis found 
Kahane charismatic and his messianic message seductive. In 1984, 20,000 
Israelis elected him to Parliament. He refused to pledge allegiance to the 
state and claimed he would only declare loyalty to his God. 
</P>
<P>
 The political atmosphere created by the right-wing governments of Menachem 
Begin and Shamir tolerated the Kahanes. But when his rising popularity 
threatened to disrupt the political balance, right and left united to ban 
Kahane and his movement from participating in the 1988 elections. They were 
accused of preaching hatred, racism, anti-democracy and, worst of all, the 
purity of Jewish blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahane's assassination, in 1990, only served to strengthen his legacy. In his 
voyage to the dark side of the Israeli psyche, he found fertile soil in which 
to plant his seed. No doubt, Kahane's lasting achievement is his exposure of 
this part of the Israeli character. By publicly advocating the expulsion of 
Arabs, he broke Israeli -- and Jewish -- taboos, thereby pushing them to the 
top of the Israeli-Palestinian agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 There are Israelis, like retired Gen. Rehavam Zeevi, who preach Kahane's 
sermon using more "sensible" and "respectable" language. And there remain 
Kahane's own followers. Despite the recent steps taken by the Israeli 
government to curb the movements of Kach members, most remain at large and 
armed. Some are capable of picking up where Goldstein left off. 
</P>
<P>
 The vicious circle of massacre, vengeance and revenge between Jew and Arab in 
the Middle East seems to have spread to New York last week, when a van of 
Hasidic students was fired on. Four were wounded, two seriously. A Lebanese 
national has been charged in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 More than goodwill will be needed to stop such attacks, here as well as in the 
Middle East. The PLO must return to the negotiating table, and the Israeli 
government has to demonstrate its seriousness in vowing to crack down on Jewish 
extremists. Otherwise, the Goldstein "incident" may be only a prelude.

THE YEAR OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY IN MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Carlos Fuentes, Carlos Fuentes is the author, among other books, of Return 
to Mexico: Journeys Behind the Mask (Norton). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 1994 will be the crucial year for Mexican democracy. The Party of 
Revolutionary Institutions (PRI) has no viable answers for the heart of 
Mexico's problem -- its social, eco nomic and cultural realities no lon ger 
coincide with its political structures. This was Spain's problem when Francisco 
Franco died. The Spanish transition to democracy is, in many ways, a model that 
Mexico can follow. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, four factors will determine the nature of this year's transition: 
the electoral year, negotiations in Chiapas, which have now produced a 
tentative agreement, negotiations in Mexico City and the president himself. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 21, Mexicans will elect a new president, a new Congress and various 
governorships. But the black bean in the white rice, as we say in Mexico, is 
that our elections are burdened with the dubious prestige of a good whorehouse: 
They work, but are they virtuous? 
</P>
<P>
 Today, there is a general impression that Mexico's elections have never been 
virtuous and no longer work. If the prolonged regency of the PRI once sustained 
itself on the party's offer of internal peace along with economic development, 
the rebellion in Chiapas has destroyed that image. The country is nervous, 
unsatisfied. Too many people have been left behind, and macroeconomic successes 
can no longer hide or resolve microeconomic realities. But then, as the 
unorthodox candidate to the Chilean presidency in last year's election, Manfred 
Max Neff, told me in Santiago, "No one lives in the macroeconomy." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's economic 
measures do not deserve praise. Stabilizing an economy that had almost hit 
rock-bottom, controlling inflation, trimming the fat of the state, amassing 
currency reserves, attracting foreign capital, managing debt and opening up the 
sealed, protectionist economy to free trade and global integration -- all have 
been largely successful policies, even as they create problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Salinas government was convinced that economic reform at the top 
would: a) make people's lives better at the bottom and b) banish, or at least 
postpone, demands for democratic reform. The Soviet example was constantly 
invoked in government circles. You can't have perestroika and glasnost at the 
same time, we were told. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, too many Mexicans thought otherwise. Each gubernatorial election 
since 1989 has been marred by fraud, post-electoral conflict, the deaths of 
opposition partisans and the naming of interim governors by the president. 
Right now, of 32 Mexican states, 17 are ruled by interim governors. This means 
that more than half the country's 90 million people are governed by people they 
did not elect. 
</P>
<P>
 Credible elections thus impinge on another urgent Mexican reform. We need a 
working federalism, but creating an effective system means establishing a true 
balance of powers, a freely elected Congress and an independent judiciary. All 
this, in turn, requires checks and balances, accountability and credible 
elections. A large menu for any country with Mexico's authoritarian tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-handed electoral reforms of the Salinas government gave the PRI 
automatic majorities in the name of "governability" and left the electoral 
institutions in the hands of the government and, thus of its electoral hook, 
the PRI. Demands for electoral reform began last year but got nowhere until 
Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiapas rebellion has been the detonator. Even the wooden rifles used by 
the rebels hit their targets: the inequality of the country is just too great, 
the conspiracy between local exploiters and local authorities indecent. Wrongs 
cannot be righted without local democracy in Chiapas, meaning the rights of the 
peasant and Indian communities to elect their own leaders. But you cannot have 
democracy in Chiapas without democracy in Mexico, or democracy in Mexico 
without democracy in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 The local problems of Chiapas and the national problems of democracy are 
intimately linked. The people of Chiapas have realized that a brutal change is 
about to take place. From being simply exploited over the centuries, they were 
about to become marginalized for the next millennium in a macroeconomic, 
technocratic, global village. Millions like them exist in other Mexican states. 
A signal from Subcommandante Marcos, the rebel leader in Chiapas, could set 
dozens of Chiapas-like rebellions on the march. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas has said he is trying to correct things that had gone wrong, and he 
has set the stage for the ongoing political negotiations headed, in Mexico 
City, by the secretary of the interior, human-rights advocate Jorge Carpizo 
MacGregor. No Mexican president before him has admitted to any mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, this young, energetic and intelligent president has his task cut out 
for him. Mexican presidents are known for one thing. Lazaro Cardenas means Oil. 
Miguel Aleman, Industrialization. Diaz Ordaz, the Tlatelolco massacre. Jose 
Lopez Portillo, Debt. They are historically labeled. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas, until Dec. 31, 1993, would have had just one label: NAFTA. After Jan. 
1, he is tagged by Chiapas. But before surrendering office Dec. 1, he could -- 
and should -- have a single historical insignia: Democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiations headed by Carpizo have a clear agenda. The electoral law must 
be reformed yet again so that the electoral authorities are independent of the 
president and the PRI. The electoral lists must be updated and approved by all 
political parties. A limit must be set on partisan funding, and public 
resources must not be employed for partisan ends. Electoral fraud must be 
penalized. Access to the media must be assured. Results must be known promptly. 
</P>
<P>
 The big problem of Mexico's fraud-ridden system is that it is not credible. In 
fact, it is so incredible that people only believe there was no hanky-panky if 
the PRI candidate looses. The electoral reform must make things so credible 
that people can believe in the election even if the PRI candidate wins. A big 
step in this direction will be the presence of both national and international 
observers. The former are readily admitted by all. The latter the government 
balks at admitting. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth element of this Mexican poker is the president himself, Salinas as 
guarantor of a democratic process. But a passive guaranty is not enough. I'm 
afraid the president himself has to take up the banner of democratic reform and 
campaign as forcefully for it as he did for the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. He cannot go on making piecemeal concessions without weakening the 
presidential institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas was wrong in hurdling over any internal democratic process in his own 
party and naming one of the three PRI contenders as the PRI candidate through 
presidential fiat. Both the PRI and the country would have benefited from three 
pre-campaigns. As it is, Luis Donaldo Colosio was designated not only candidate 
but heir. Now, after Chiapas, Colosio has to establish his own credibility, his 
own independence and his own commitment to democracy. He faces not only the 
traditional right and left opposition, but also an potential challenge from 
within his own ranks. Manuel Camacho Solis, dead after the president fingered 
Colosio, rose from his grave when the same president named him peace 
commissioner in Chiapas on the same day Colosio began his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 But democracy will not depend only on a few men, even on better elections, but 
on a whole new culture, the culture of the civil society -- its 
non-governmental organizations, co-ops and unions, media and associations -- 
rising from the bottom and the margins of our society. That takes time. What 
1994 will tell us is how much time: a lot, a little or none at all.

THE DEATH-PENALTY DECISION: BLACKMUN'S VERY PUBLIC SHIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David M. O'Brien, David M. O'Brien is a professor of government at the 
University of Virginia and author, among many other books, of Storm Center: The 
Supreme Court in American Politics (Norton). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Justice Harry A. Blackmun's recent announcement that he considered the death 
penalty unconstitutional, and would "no longer tinker with the machinery of 
death," was in many ways extraordinary. Yet, how and why he sought to draw 
public attention to his about-face on that red-hot political issue was 
singularly unprecedented as well.  
</P>
<P>
 Supreme Court justices rarely change their minds so dramatically. They are 
certainly not given to striking out on their own against colleagues or the tide 
of public opinion. Though barbed exchanges and personal attacks have become 
more common in opinions, Blackmun's expression of personal agony over 
executions was unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 Justices rarely file dissenting opinions from the court's denial review of 
cases. Those they do file usually go unnoticed. Yet, the national debate over 
capital punishment began more than 30 years ago with another dissent from a 
denial of review. In the 1963 case, Rudolph vs. Alabama, for the first time 
ever, Justice Arthur J. Goldberg suggested that capital punishment might 
violate the Eighth Amendment's ban on "cruel and unusual punishment." His 
dissenting opinion signaled lawyers to challenge head-on the constitutionality 
of the death penalty. It resulted in a decade-long moratorium on executions 
and, eventually, to the Supreme Court's striking down of capital- punishment 
laws in the 1972 decision, Furman vs. Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackmun's shift is all the more ironic because he was appointed in 1970 for 
his conservative "law and order" views by Republican President Richard M. 
Nixon. He dissented from the Furman ruling that existing death-penalty laws 
were unconstitutional because they resulted in arbitrary, capricious and 
discriminatory executions. In Justice Potter Stewart's words, they are "cruel 
and unusual in the same way that being struck by lightning is cruel and 
unusual." 
</P>
<P>
 After more than two decades, Blackmun has finally come around to Stewart's 
view. On other matters of criminal justice, he remains basically conservative. 
But death is different. And Blackmun now stands alone on the court in opposing 
capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving aside the issue, Blackmun's switch appears unusual in other ways. We 
tend to think of justices becoming more conservative as they grow older. Felix 
Frankfurter, for one, was appointed by Franklin D. Roosevelt as a well-known 
liberal Harvard Law professor. Over the course of his career, though, he 
emerged as a leading conservative. Many others justices followed this path. 
</P>
<P>
 Other times, justices have not changed as much as circumstances overtook them. 
Another Roosevelt appointee, Justice Hugo L. Black, was considered the leading 
liberal defender of First Amendment freedoms in the 1940s and '50s. By the late 
1960s, however, he was fighting a rear-guard action against the prevailing 
forces on the progressive Warren Court. The court and the country had changed 
-- but not Black.  
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, justices in the past have reconsidered their positions. The view 
from the bench occasionally changes their perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic President Harry S. Truman was dumbfounded by the vote of his 
appointee, Justice Tom C. Clark, in the Steel Seizure case in 1952. As his 
former attorney general, Clark had assured Truman that he had the power to 
seize steel mills to avert nationwide strikes that might threaten the war 
effort in Korea. On the bench, however, Justice Clark voted otherwise. Justice 
Robert H. Jackson similarly recanted on what he had told Roosevelt when he was 
his attorney general, explaining, "The matter does not appear to me now as it 
appears to have appeared to me then." 
</P>
<P>
 Life in the marble temple affords opportunities for reflection and growth -- 
even though notions of precedent can be constraining. Deference to precedent 
and institutional norms incline justices to stand firm once they take a 
position. Nonetheless, they do occasionally switch -- but usually without the 
drama and publicity that accompanied Blackmun's recent move. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Blackmun has changed his mind on other, less publicized, issues. In 
1976, for example, he cast the crucial vote in a bare majority for enforcing 
the 10th Amendment -- which guarantees the states' "reserved powers" as a 
limitation on Congress. Almost a decade later, he concluded there was no basis 
for applying the 10th Amendment. And he voted to overturn the earlier decision. 
Yet, he did not strike out on his own then as he has now. 
</P>
<P>
 For those serving on the Supreme Court, time also brings changes in 
perspective. That clearly figured in Blackmun's turnabout. Every year, he faced 
scores of death-penalty appeals. It wore on him and he struggled over those 
about to be executed -- especially when they had had inadequate attorneys or, 
as he said, got "a runaround" in the lower courts. The "staggering evidence of 
racial prejudice" also took its toll on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, after more than 20 years, Blackmun concluded, "Whether a human 
being should live or die is so inherently subjective -- rife with all of life's 
understandings, experiences, prejudices and passions -- that it inevitably 
defies the rationality and consistency required by the Constitution." 
Conscience stood in the way of continuing to support what, he conceded, the 
Constitution permits and politicians in both parties increasingly demand. 
</P>
<P>
 In so publicly highlighting his reversal on capital punishment, Blackmun held 
himself up for criticism and ridicule. Hard-line conservatives jumped at the 
chance to denounce him. Justice Antonin Scalia dismissed his reasoning as 
"false, untextual and unhistorical."  
</P>
<P>
 That Blackmun sought publicity for his switch remains at the heart of the 
matter. There are few comparable issues on which justices have said they erred 
and then sought public recognition of that. The closest was when Justice Lewis 
F. Powell Jr. publicly regretted casting the crucial fifth vote to uphold laws 
banning homosexual and heterosexual sodomy in Bowers vs. Hardwick in 1986. 
Several years later, he confessed, "I think I probably made a mistake in that 
one." Unlike Blackmun, however, Powell spoke out after he left the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackmun's switch and public disavowal of capital punishment appears singular 
in the court's history -- though not unexpected. He has been outspoken before 
in breaking with the court's tradition of "judicial lockjaw," as Frankfurter 
put it. His off-the-bench remarks are often frank expressions of emotion. He 
has repeatedly lamented over the years, for example, that he would probably 
take "to his grave" his authorship of the 1973 landmark abortion ruling in Roe 
vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, in another dramatic break with court tradition, Blackmun appeared 
on "Nightline." It was about as close as a justice comes to holding a press 
conference. There, he talked candidly about his disillusionment with how the 
system of capital punishment works. He went out of his way to set the stage for 
attracting as much public attention as possible to his new stand against the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 By almost any measure, Blackmun's announcement was singular and orchestrated 
to renew debate. Notably, he did not come out against capital punishment on 
moral grounds -- as had former Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood 
Marshall. Instead, he emphasized his years of experience with "the machinery of 
death." 
</P>
<P>
 Blackmun was moved by the inexorable racism that taints and the injustices 
that accompany the practice of capital punishment in the United States. 
Ultimately, he could no longer abide by the court's underlying philosophy that 
sustains a system of admittedly cruel punishment inflicted only in unusual 
cases to satisfy society's demand for retribution. 
</P>
<P>
 In his remaining time on the bench, Blackmun apparently wants to clear his 
conscience, letting the chips fall where they may. In reversing himself on such 
a politically charged issue and in such a publicized way, he certainly broke 
with tradition and made an unprecedented but calculated appeal to future 
generations.

FOR YELTSIN, IT'S LONELY AT THE TOP -- BUT NOT BECAUSE HE'S POWERFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Roy Medvedev, Roy Medvedev, a Russian historian, is author of Let History 
Judge: The Origins and Consequences of Stalinism (Columbia University Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since the parliamentary elections two months ago, a new political reality has 
formed in Russia. Paradoxically, the new constitution has not fulfilled its 
purpose: to amplify the authority and influence of President Boris N. Yeltsin. 
The situation is reminiscent of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's. The more new rights and 
powers the former president received from the Supreme Soviet, the more illusory 
his authority became. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides formal authority, a leader needs the people's faith -- and Yeltsin has 
not received a new installment of the people's trust. His intention to create 
his own "party of power" is hollow, since only bureaucrats from his 
administration would join it. 
</P>
<P>
 Many influential politicians who only yesterday were totally loyal to Yeltsin 
now only think about future presidential elections. After meeting with Yeltsin 
before announcing her resignation, Social Security Minister Ella A. Pamfilova 
said, "He is very lonely." In other words: Yeltsin is politically isolated, the 
result of unpopular policies. 
</P>
<P>
 What is the new disposition of the political forces in Russia? 
</P>
<P>
 Though the majority in the lower chamber of Parliament belongs to the 
political opposition, Yeltsin cannot even count on the support of his 
ostensible allies in Russia's Choice. The faction has already announced its 
opposition to the government of Prime Minister Victor S. Chernomyrdin and 
increasingly criticizes the president for accepting virtually all the 
conditions of the "government of pragmatists." Many of his harshest critics -- 
including, Yegor T. Gaidar, Gennady E. Burbulis, Sergei M. Shakhrai, Nikolai I. 
Travkin, Grigory A. Yavlinsky -- were once close allies. The speaker of the 
lower chamber is Ivan Rybkin, who ran on the conservative Agrarian Party slate. 
</P>
<P>
 A more favorable situation exists in the Federation Council, the upper house 
of Parliament, where Vice Premier Vladimir F. Shumeiko, an ally, was elected 
chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even that advantage is mixed. Although many members of the chamber, as 
regional heads of administration, owe their jobs to Yeltsin, the election of 
Shumeiko became possible only after Chernomyrdin intervened. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, at the center of Russia's changing political reality is the prime 
minister's growing influence. Chernomyrdin not only enjoys greater support in 
both houses of Parliament. According to the new constitution, the head of the 
government is the legal inheritor of presidential powers, the "non-elected vice 
president." Former Vice President Alexander V. Rutskoi, who opposed the 
bankrupt policy of Gaidar, did not even enjoy a fraction of Chernomyrdin's 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin has sought to offset Chernomyrdin's clout by securing his personal 
control over the "power" ministries -- defense, interior and security. He 
apparently anticipates more social and economic troubles and is trying to 
distance himself from the government, shifting responsibility in the prime 
minister's direction whenever opportunity arises. But judging from 
Chernomyrdin's behavior, he is not afraid of taking responsibility. He 
understands that the difficulties connected with reform are tied in the public 
mind to Yeltsin and Gaidar. 
</P>
<P>
 There are equally important developments in the other republics of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States. The possible monetary union of Russia and 
Belarus, which served as a pretext for Gaidar's resignation, could herald the 
restoration of a ruble zone. It would hold together a budding economic union of 
former Soviet republics and facilitate their political integration. The 
economic and military might of the Soviet Union, it should be recalled, was 
based on the union of Russia, Byelorussia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 Any real move toward political and economic integration would not be warmly 
received in the international financial centers that advised the course of 
action followed by economic reformers Gaidar and Boris G. Fyodorov. With their 
resignations, the Russian state slowly began to change its course. This shift 
worries those who favored the collapse of the Soviet Union, in 1991, and 
supported the bankrupt policy of "shock therapy." To reformers, the recent 
ouster of Stanislav Shushkevich, chairman of Belarus' Supreme Council, was a 
major defeat, widely interpreted as the revenge of reform's opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 The next scheduled elections in Russia will be local. Given the growing 
influence of the regional economic and political elites, the importance of 
these elections should not be underestimated. Russian and foreign political 
scientists and analysts are looking toward the results with concern: Will the 
elections confirm the tendencies that emerged last December, when the far-right 
party of Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky unexpectedly won, or will they reveal more 
favorable attitudes toward the Kremlin? 
</P>
<P>
 As in the days when the Communist Party held political power in the Soviet 
Union, the overriding problem is that Russia still lacks one fundamental 
attribute of a democracy: a legal mechanism for transferring power. Yeltsin's 
starry hour was over long ago. He has clearly run out of political, physical 
and psychological resources. It is also evident that Yeltsin has not been 
involved in the implementation of reforms for a long time. He is preoccupied 
with his personal political survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Political isolation is a worrisome symptom of the approaching political 
collapse. The main task of the painfully emerging Russian democracy is to 
separate the personal drama of a politician from a repetition of the national 
tragedy.

EVERYONE IS TOUGH ON CRIME -- BUT AVOIDS THE REAL ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan Estrich, Susan Estrich, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a law 
professor at USC. She served as campaign manager for Michael S. Dukakis in 
1988. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The fact that crime is the No. 1 issue in American politics virtually 
guarantees nothing significant will be done to make the streets safer. The 
people are afraid of the criminals, and the politicians are afraid of the 
people. So the politicians will vie to talk toughest, good slogans will take 
the place of good policy and bad ideas will be enacted into law. The politics 
of crime leaves no room for a real discussion of policy, particularly when so 
few leaders have the guts to be honest about crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear of crime is real and growing. It is fueled not only by local TV stations 
in search of ratings, and local politicians in search of reelection, but also 
by the realities of daily life. While it is true, as criminologists point out, 
that the overall crime rate decreased last year, the level of violence is 
increasing. A decade ago, burglars who broke into your home just wanted your 
silver and TV; today, they're armed, and don't give a damn about killing you. 
The fear of crime is with us wherever we go. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also true that the system is failing in fundamental respects. In 
California, killers, on average, serve fewer than eight years in prison -- 
higher than in many states. But the criminal-justice system is a revolving door 
-- with too few criminals caught in the first instance, too few of them 
prosecuted and convicted, and too few sentenced to real punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 But "three strikes and you're out" -- this year's answer to the crime problem 
-- won't solve this. Neither will the death penalty, or boot camps for first 
offenders, or massive prison construction -- other answers being offered by 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The political debate on crime is not about cutting crime: It's about politics. 
And most politicians are convinced the public isn't capable of understanding 
that slogans aren't solutions, let alone that prevention is ultimately more 
important than punishment. So politicians give us what they think we want -- 
tough talk -- leaving no room for discussions about policy that we so 
desperately need. 
</P>
<P>
 The popularity of the "three strikes" idea tells as much about what's wrong 
with the political system as it does about the failings of the criminal-justice 
system. Violent criminals should do hard time -- and we shouldn't have to wait 
until their third conviction for real punishment. Locking up 20-year-old 
robbers makes sense; but keeping them there when they're 50, and their criminal 
careers long over, won't make streets safer. Besides, some "three strikes" 
proposals are so badly drafted that you could be sentenced to life for bouncing 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
 People can be excused for their embrace of "three strikes and you're out": 
It's a bad idea whose time has come, the outgrowth of legitimate frustration 
about a system that doesn't work and a society that is increasingly violent. 
The politicians, who know better and bear some of the responsibility, should be 
ashamed of themselves. But they're not. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, with great fanfare, Vice President Al Gore introduced the 
Administration's version of "three strikes," saying that it would make a "huge 
dent" in crime. A "huge dent?" The Administration's figures suggest the 
proposal would apply to, at most, 200 to 300 offenders -- hardly a "huge dent" 
in the crime rate of any large city, let alone the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Sacramento, politicians from both sides of the aisle are 
trampling each other in their rush to support any number of versions of a state 
"three strikes" measure -- notwithstanding a Department of Corrections report 
forecasting costs of $21 billion in prison construction and $5.7 billion 
annually to run the new prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 But "three strikes" isn't really about controlling crime, at least in the 
political context. It's about values and toughness -- and getting elected. The 
President's pollster admitted as much last month, describing it as a question 
of values. Like the death penalty and Willie Horton, "three strikes" is a 
measure of how tough you are. And no Democrat running for any major office, or 
trying to hold onto one, wants to fail the toughness test.  
</P>
<P>
 But when do we get to talk about controlling crime? The best reason to be for 
the death penalty is because some people deserve it -- not because it will stop 
random murders. The Willie Hortons of the world shouldn't be furloughed, but 
that won't cut crime significantly, either. When do we get to move beyond good 
politics, to even talking about what might be good policy? 
</P>
<P>
 The day after he announced his resignation as deputy attorney general, Philip 
B. Heymann, a distinguished criminal-law professor and former head of the 
Justice Department's criminal division, said many of the toughest provisions of 
the crime bill making its way through Congress are wasteful and doomed to 
failure. "Politics," he said, "have overwhelmed reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Heymann pointed out that few 50-year-olds commit street robberies, that 
federal prisons are filled with people who are not dangerous and that half the 
prisoners now overcrowding state penitentiaries are serving time for nonviolent 
crimes. All true -- but what's most significant is that it was only as the 
former deputy attorney general that Heymann felt free to say this. Meanwhile, 
the tough-on-crime bill will surely be passed with the Administration's 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to stand up and say you're for tougher sentences. Just watch the 
politicians in Sacramento and Washington. It takes guts to admit that if we're 
going to increase sentences for violent offenders -- as we should -- without 
closing down the schools to support the prisons, then we need to reduce the 
sentences for some nonviolent offenders, even re-examine how we deal with some 
drug offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 When M. Joycelyn Elders, the surgeon general, said we should study the 
potential impact of decriminalizing some drug offenses, the Administration 
nixed the idea: It was inconsistent with its "tough" anti-crime position. It 
was bad politics. But it might be good policy. In this climate, we'll never 
know. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, California prisons were so overcrowded that the prospect of 
court-ordered releases was a real one. It might have been an opportunity for 
the Legislature -- and the people of this state -- to engage in a debate about 
priorities: about who should be locked up longer, and who let out sooner. But 
that would be politically dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Legislature took the easy tack. They increased the potential 
"good time" credit a prisoner could earn from one-third to one-half of his 
sentence. In effect, they offered every prisoner -- regardless of the crime 
committed -- the opportunity to cut his sentence in half. One who took 
advantage of this was Richard Allen Harris, who'd been sentenced to 16 years 
for kidnaping and robbery. He served eight. He was released in June, 1993. Four 
months later, he allegedly kidnaped and killed Polly Klaas. Today, he is the 
poster boy for the "three strikes" initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes even more guts to admit that all the prisons in the world won't solve 
the crime problem. In the last two decades, California increased its prison 
population by 100,000 -- but no one feels safer. Boot camps don't turn 
offenders into honest citizens. Simply adding more police doesn't work, either. 
The criminal-justice system, operating efficiently, couldn't begin to address 
the enormity of the problem. It's not fashionable these days to talk about the 
roots of crime -- about drugs and poverty and unemployment, about children 
having children and fathers not taking responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds soft when everyone in politics is so desperate to sound tough. But 
if "three strikes" and the death penalty and more prisons are our only answers 
-- as they are in this election year -- then for every violent 17-year-old we 
lock up, there'll be another ready to take his place. It is a sad commentary on 
our politics, on the timidity of our leaders and their lack of faith in the 
public that we might do better in dealing with the crime problem if people 
didn't care so much about it.

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; MICHAEL MORIARTY; WHEN FIGHTING AGAINST CENSORSHIP 
MEANS DEFENDING TELEVISION VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 In the fall of 1993, television executives were feeling beleaguered. On 
Capitol Hill, voices in the House and Senate were blaming television for the 
violence so evident in the streets of America. Congress was threatening the 
industry with legislation that imposed limits on violent programming, if the 
programmers didn't limit the violence themselves. In October, Atty. Gen. Janet 
Reno made headlines when she endorsed such legislation. She also told the 
Senate Commerce Committee that in her opinion, "the regulation of (television) 
violence is constitutionally permissible." 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 18, Reno had a meeting with a group from NBC. West Coast President 
Donald W. Ohlmeyer Jr. was there, as was NBC's chief censor, Rosalyn Weinman, 
of Standards and Practices. Dick Wolf, executive producer of NBC's "Law & 
Order" had been invited, and he'd brought along one of his stars, Michael 
Moriarty. Moriarty, who portrayed District Atty. Ben Stone on "Law & Order," 
left the meeting steaming and dismayed. He was outraged by Reno's conclusion 
that television was inspiring real-life violence. And he says he was sickened 
by what he saw as the attorney general's contempt for both television and the 
U.S. Constitution. Others in the room may have felt the Justice Department had 
no business telling television networks what to program -- but only Moriarty 
went public with his outrage. 
</P>
<P>
 He called a news conference and blasted Reno. He took out ads in the trade 
papers seeking support for creative expression. His pleas were met with 
silence. No call from Clint Eastwood. No fax from Sylvester Stallone or Steven 
Segal. No one else in Hollywood, it seemed, was willing to support Moriarty's 
position that violence has always been an important part of drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Moriarty, 52, was raised in Detroit and educated by Jesuits. A Fulbright 
scholar, he's a Tony-award-winning Broadway actor, a published poet and 
playwright and an accomplished jazz pianist and composer. He has won two Emmys 
for his television work -- the second for his role as SS Officer Dorf in the 
miniseries, "Holocaust." Moriarty lives in New York with his wife, Anne Martin, 
and his son, Matthew Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he began his battle with Reno, Moriarty has resigned from "Law & Order" 
-- he claims he was being written out of the show to punish him for his 
activism. Still, in a business where everything is a career move, Moriarty 
seems to have landed on his feet. He'll open in the Broadway production of "My 
Fair Lady" on April 8, as Professor Henry Higgins. But that good fortune has 
not cooled his outrage. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How did you end up at that meeting with Janet Reno?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Dick Wolf (executive producer of "Law & Order") said, "Why don't you 
come down to Washington with me to meet the attorney general?" I said, "What is 
this -- some stupid photo-op?" He said, "No, no. If she gets her way, shows 
like 'Law & Order' could go off the air." And here we are in the fourth year of 
the show, the ratings have never been better, we're starting to get into a 
groove, and out of left field comes Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way down there, I heard it was rumored that the President wasn't too 
pleased with the fierceness of her presentation to Congress on this matter of 
TV violence. We were told that she might lighten up, that we'd have a nice 
meeting, all go home and it would be over. But that wasn't the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why was "Law & Order" singled out?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Janet Reno fired a volley across the bow of network television. Roz 
Weinman, a censor at NBC, must have called her up and said, "Let's sit down and 
have a powwow." It's like Bobby Kennedy saying Jimmy Hoffa is involved in 
racketeering, and Hoffa's lawyer saying, "Wait a minute, Bobby, let's talk." 
But unlike that case, there's no law on the books prohibiting violence on 
television. The attorney general should be enforcing the law, not policy. To 
threaten us with unconstitutional legislation -- it's an outrage! 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why is yours such a lonely voice in this debate? Why has no other actor, 
producer or executive spoken out in support of your position?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The only thing I can think of is that I came through the theater -- an 
ancient art form. Film is something that came later into my life. I had a 
Jesuit education, and I consider acting and the theater as kind of a calling -- 
a vocation. And anyone who assaults it, after 3,000 years of history, outrages 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 Should we suggest that Al Capone learned everything he knew from George Raft? 
The idea that television is responsible for violence is the stupidest idea 
since Adolf Hitler said the Aryan race is superior. His psychological tests 
proving that have about as much credence as the ones that say violence on 
television causes violence on the streets. It's a dangerous notion, because it 
creates bigotry and fear. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood community is very insecure about this because television doesn't 
have the history of the theater. They actually think Janet Reno may be right -- 
that they are responsible for the violence in society! 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, Hollywood helped put Clinton into office. He's their man. Look, I 
voted for Clinton, too, because I thought he was a liberal. I'm not a liberal 
anymore. I'm sick of it. The President meets with (CAA chief) Michael Ovitz and 
treats Ovitz like he's a head of state. And yet, Clinton allows Janet Reno to 
beat up on television. There's no campaign against movies. They go after 
television because it's like the runt of the litter. 
</P>
<P>
 I hate going to L.A. and dealing with the contempt people have for television 
and television actors. It's unbelievable the kind of attitude people take 
toward what is the most exciting medium we've got right now. Television is the 
most open, it's the most potentially rebellious -- we've got new channels 
coming in every day, and young, new people with fresh ideas. But because it is 
this mass medium and it has to turn out so much product, there is a caste 
system, and a contempt and self-loathing I despise. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is it your belief that violence in drama is beneficial, that it offers a 
safe outlet for our dark sides?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Violent drama has been a hallmark of every great civilization. It is not 
the cause of the disease -- it is an immunizing factor. People go to the 
theater to experience emotions like fear and loathing. Violent drama shows us 
where we come from. It makes us face our hypocrisy. We package our food and put 
it in the freezer, and it looks like it was made there. But it wasn't. The 
tonnage of living matter we slaughter by the second in order to keep this race 
alive would make Caligula blush. 
</P>
<P>
 Another metaphor -- Holocaust survivor and writer Elie Wiesel. He spent his 
youth in Nazi camps surrounded by violence. Did that turn him into a maniac? He 
won a Nobel Peace Prize. Did the other camp survivors turn into a pack of 
Bonnie and Clydes? No! They built a nation, because they understood the nature 
of man. 
</P>
<P>
 We look at violence in drama like we look at a car accident. It's a way of 
coming to terms with our mortality, and with potential disaster. And for people 
in Hollywood to actually express shame for what they've done, after it's clear 
from the box office and the ratings what America wants? Do we want a government 
which treats the nation as if we were children? And that says our actual 
children are victims of the adults? That's a sick attitude, and it's liberal 
fascism. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So do you see this campaign against TV violence as a scapegoat for the 
government's inability to control actual violence in society?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I have no doubt. At least 50% of the violence out there is due to the war 
on drugs. The absurdity of this war grows greater every day. Again if you look 
at history and the '20s, you had the same thing -- the same kind of hypocrisy. 
Kids on the street became part of the drug cartel in the same way the Purple 
Gang became part of the bootlegging cartel. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is police corruption -- huge in the '20, huge now, going straight 
up to the CIA. And people are more afraid of the solution than they are of the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Until U.S. Surgeon Gen. Joycelyn Elders stood up and said we better start 
looking at legalization of drugs, nobody wanted to talk about it. So if there's 
anything good which has come out of this attack on television, it's that people 
are starting to look at the real reasons for violence, rather than at the 
scapegoat. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Should there be no limit to what can be broadcast?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The limit comes from the audience. I have no complaints with citizens like 
Terry Rakolta (head of Americans for Responsible Television), who use whatever 
measures they can -- boycotting advertisers, protesting or writing letters -- 
to make their views on television violence known. That's the way our system is 
built. But it's tougher than going up the fallopian tubes to get a show on 
television -- and the audience votes every half-hour on what they want to see. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you say to those who say the content of television needs to be 
controlled because children have access to it?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I say that's the first step toward a police state. If the government places 
itself within the domestic situation, between the parent and child, and the 
government says it knows better than the parent how to raise that child, you've 
really opened up Pandora's box. 
</P>
<P>
 I think if you open the door to government control of television, then you let 
in a host of questions about rights. Mommy's secondhand smoke -- which is more 
dangerous than any television -- are you going to make her smoke in the 
bathroom? Someone who owns guns -- does he have to keep them out of the house 
from the hours of 6 to 10 p.m.? 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't trust the parents of America, you don't trust America, and you 
don't trust the American system. Because you, Mr. and Ms. Washington, D.C., are 
working for us. You are not our parents. And you don't tell us we don't know 
what we are doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I still don't understand why, if there is indeed a concerted government 
attack on television, network executives don't go on the counterattack?  
</P>
<P>
 A: They're doing the corporate thing. Throw them a bone, pay a ransom and it 
will go away -- I'm almost quoting Dick Wolf verbatim. That's the basic 
attitude: Anything is negotiable. But I wasn't built in the corporate system. I 
went in there as an artist. And, suddenly, I felt fear and I heard lies and I 
began to feel as if I was dealing with the KGB in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In another interview, you said it doesn't matter if you ever act again. As 
someone whose life is so much about acting, how could you say that?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Hell, I can make a living -- I'll wait tables. One thing I am not is a 
careerist. Janet Reno would not do what she is doing if her career were not 
more important to her than her common sense. Television executives know that 
this is wrong, but they would lose their job if they went head-to-head with the 
federal government. I have the freedom to say, screw it. I can do a little 
piano here, write books there, whatever. I am not going to give up my personal 
freedom and self-respect for a career. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: And yet, couldn't one say all this has led you back to the theater -- where 
you began?  
</P>
<P>
 A: If someone told me seven months ago that in April I would open in "My Fair 
Lady" on Broadway, I would have said they were crazy. So I always think of God 
sitting up there saying, "Well, I want to see Moriarty as Henry Higgins. How do 
we do that? Let's introduce him to Janet Reno!" 
</P>
<P>
 It all started there on Nov. 18. That was the pool table where my eight ball 
landed in the corner pocket. I've shed a veil because of that meeting. Before I 
was just an artist -- but I stood up and spoke my piece. I'm a citizen now. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How has all this left you feeling? Are you optimistic about freedom of 
expression, or do you fear the government will actually place controls on 
television programming?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm optimistic by nature. I know I will win, just like David knew Goliath 
was going to go down. Because all the people who've ever called for censorship 
in the world have ended up exposed as villains or clowns. And anyone who stands 
up in the Land of the Free and says, "I'm allowed my own imagination," is going 
to win. They're just going to win.

'NEW DEMOCRATS' SEEM LIKE 'OLD REPUBLICANS' ON CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By James A. Baker III, James A. Baker III served as secretary of state and 
Treasury secretary. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I ran for attorney general of Texas in 1978, I asked Texans about the 
then-current wave of violent crime. My TV spots ended with the tag line: "Had 
enough?" 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, unfortunately, the number of violent crimes has nearly doubled. 
Statistics show four out of five Americans will be victims of violent crime at 
least once in their lives. According to the FBI, a violent crime occurred once 
every 22 seconds last year. That means in the approximate time it takes to read 
this paragraph, another innocent American became a victim of violent crime. All 
Americans have had more than enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Even President Bill Clinton, "New Democrat," is sounding an awful lot like an 
"Old Republican" when it comes to crime: more police, longer sentences, more 
prisons. His call is echoed by Senate Democrats. Only the "Old Democrats" of 
the House stand between the American people and the tough anti-crime 
legislation they demand. Like the North American Free Trade Agreement last 
year, a meaningful crime bill in 1994 may depend on a center-right coalition of 
House Republicans and moderate Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Why this emerging consensus on crime? The answer is simple. Public anger about 
crime, on simmer for all these decades, is boiling over. 
</P>
<P>
 When 68 innocent Bosnians were killed by a savage mortar attack on a Sarajevo 
market, world opinion was aghast. Yet each day, on average, roughly the same 
number of Americans are murdered.  
</P>
<P>
 Today's clamor about crime transcends the individual outrages that capture our 
horrified imaginations. The murder of Polly Klaas, the killing of Michael 
Jordan's father or the slaughter of commuters on the Long Island Railroad are 
symptoms of a broader pathology that has beset our society. 
</P>
<P>
 Violent crime has become an American childhood disease. Violence among 
American youth may be the most discouraging phenomenon of contemporary society. 
Persons under the age of 21 committed one-third of all murders in 1990. Young 
people are also increasingly victims of violent crime. Metal detectors at urban 
high schools symbolize the extent that survival has become the major rite of 
passage for many adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans understand there is something wrong -- dreadfully wrong -- with a 
society in which a murder occurs every 22 minutes, a rape every 5 minutes and a 
robbery every 47 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 So vociferous has been the public outcry about crime, in fact, that even 
liberals have begun, however belatedly, to respond. Last November, for example, 
Senate Democrats joined Republicans in passing, 95-4, a tough anti-crime bill. 
A political sea-change is under way. Like the President, many moderate 
Democrats are talking tough on crime. Some have shifted positions because they 
realize the terrible damage done by permissive social policies -- especially to 
the disadvantaged communities many Democrats represent.  
</P>
<P>
 The "new" consensus sounds uncannily like GOP crime planks of the past 30 
years. For the first time in decades, the word "values" can be spoken in polite 
Democratic company. Individual responsibility, behavioral restraint and respect 
for the community have been rediscovered for what they have always been: the 
prerequisites to any civil society. The President, for one, can hardly step to 
a podium without evoking them. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy outlines of this new consensus on crime can be found in the 
bipartisan $22.3 billion, five-year Senate bill passed last fall.  
</P>
<P>
 Key provisions of the bill, which builds on earlier legislation by the Reagan 
and Bush Administrations, include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Putting more police on the streets. The Senate bill calls for the federal 
government to help fund up to 100,000 new law-enforcement officers. In recent 
decades, the number of police has barely kept up with overall population 
growth, much less the nearly fourfold increase in violent crime since 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mandating tougher sentences and parole provisions. Violent offenders serve, 
on average, only 37% of their sentences. At any given time, 75% of convicted 
criminals -- about 3 million -- are on probation or parole. Not surprisingly, 
many return to violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate crime bill tightens federal sentences and includes the imposition 
of a mandatory life sentence without parole for repeat violent offenders -- the 
now famous (and long-overdue) "three strikes and you're out." The Senate bill 
seeks to stop, or at least slow, the notorious revolving door of violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 * Building more prisons. Being serious about tougher sentences means being 
serious about more prisons. Keeping violent offenders in jail is expensive. It 
pales, however, in comparison with the cost of letting criminals go free. Crime 
costs the U.S. economy, directly and indirectly, more than $650 billion a year. 
This puts the Senate's call for a modest $3 billion for 10 regional prisons in 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 The prisons planned under the Senate bill would hold state felons who might 
otherwise be released for lack of space. As a condition for states to 
participate in this program, however, they will have to ensure that all 
prisoners serve at least 85% of their allotted sentences.  
</P>
<P>
 This link between federal funding and state performance is vital -- 95% of 
violent crime is covered by state, not federal law. Any "war on crime" with a 
hope of victory will require a tough federal-state partnership to catch 
criminals, put them in jail and keep them there. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-crime initiatives were not at the top of this Administration's agenda -- 
until recently. Indeed, its record in the first year was mixed, at best. The 
Administration made a poor start by slashing 10% of all federal prosecutors and 
eliminating 250 FBI jobs. It also ended Project Triggerlock, a Bush initiative 
that had a nearly 100% conviction rate of violent felons apprehended for 
federal gun offenses. Most revealing, the Administration decided not to submit 
its own crime bill to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 But after victories by tough-on-crime Republicans in Virginia, New Jersey, New 
York and California, the Administration now appears ready, even eager to join 
the get-tough consensus against crime. It has backed the Senate package. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that bill or one like it can become law, however, an important obstacle 
has to be overcome: House Democrats. In contrast to the Senate's sweeping 
legislation, the House has a hodgepodge of 18 different bills. House 
legislation provides for only 17,000 police and is silent on issues like 
mandatory minimum sentences. Efforts by House Republicans to press ahead with 
their own crime legislation have been stymied by the Democratic majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Some moderate Democrats appear prepared to join Republicans in a bill along 
the Senate lines or, at least, a bill that could be folded into the Senate 
version in conference. But there remains a powerful rump of liberal Democrats 
who oppose not just particulars of the Senate bill but also the spirit of the 
new consensus. 
</P>
<P>
 These "Old Democrats" say "society," not the offender, is responsible for 
violent crime. One thing is certain: Their approach ensures society, not the 
offender, will pay for the consequences of crime.  
</P>
<P>
 House negotiations will stretch into the spring. If the past is any guide, 
House liberals will again seek to pass a number of separate measures instead of 
a single piece of legislation. This will allow them to water down anti-crime 
measures one by one. Such an approach could doom prospects for meaningful 
anti-crime legislation this year. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Administration wants to burnish its credentials on crime, it will need 
to weigh in strongly on the side of a bill resembling the Senate's. As it did 
with NAFTA, the Administration may be able to find allies on the GOP side of 
the aisle. Reaching out to conservatives to forge a center-right coalition on 
crime risks offending House liberals, some key to the Administration's 
congressional strategy on health-care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether to run that risk is, of course, the White House's call. But it is an 
important one. Clinton's willingness to overcome liberal opposition on crime 
will reveal whether the "New Democrat" who spoke so eloquently at the State of 
the Union Address is really so new after all.

FIREFIGHTER EXAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * This letter is in response to the article "5,000 White Males Barred from 
Taking L.A. Firefighters Exam," Feb. 26. I am not white.I am not a firefighter. 
I am not even a labor union sympathizer. I am a Mexican American, and after 
reading your news article I am outraged to say the least! 
</P>
<P>
 What in the world is happening to our elected officials? Where does it say 
that minorities make better firefighters than whites? Whatever happened to 
equal opportunity for all? Whatever happened to obtaining a position based on 
individual merit? If my house ever caught fire, I wouldn't care what the 
firefighters looked like or how they spoke! All I would ask for is that they be 
competent in putting the fire out quickly! 
</P>
<P>
 I am sick and tired of seeing our elected officials at the local and state 
level always use the same lame excuse that their hands are tied. This time they 
are saying that they are mandated by a 1974 agreement with the U.S. Department 
of Justice, to rationalize their action. Baloney!

CENTRAL LIBRARY SUNDAY HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Regarding the proposed Sunday closure of the Los Angeles Central Library 
(Feb. 21): I am appalled by the current state of our California public 
libraries. As a teacher/librarian of 32 years, I feel it imperative that both 
public libraries and school libraries remain open! Now, in the United States, 
reading is considered a right, not a privilege of status, as in the days of 
yore. As such, books should be available to all, regardless of age, ethnic 
group, social status, financial background, or work/school schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 It worries me, therefore, when I look into the future: The cost of a college 
education is rising rapidly, and will soon be one only the rich can afford. So, 
too, if various cities and school districts close their library doors -- as a 
short-cut way to save money -- books will soon be found only in the hands of 
the wealthy. I see education becoming, once again, an elitist experience: a 
giant step backwards, with long-term disastrous consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 I remind you of the words of Sir William Berkeley, governor of Virginia, 1677: 
"Thank God there are no free schools or printing . . . for learning has brought 
disobedience and heresy into the world, and printing has divulged them . . . 
God keep us from both." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the private funding grant from the Ralph M. Parsons Foundation will end 
by the close of March, and, since the library union wants the Central Library 
closed on Sundays (because of overworked librarians), I propose the following: 
Let unpaid citizens -- those with time, energy, and a love of books -- keep the 
doors open. 
</P>
<P>
 Sundays would be established as volunteer day at the Central Library. The 
public would know going in that "substandard" service might be received on that 
particular day, but allowances would be made for the inconvenience simply as a 
trade-off to keep the site open. (Although, it is my feeling that a core group 
of volunteers would quickly become acquainted with the collections). The 
Central Library now checks out twice as many books an hour on Sunday than on 
any other day, so those 2,000-plus visitors would appreciate the service they 
were getting, regardless. 
</P>
<P>
 My own particular area of expertise is children's literature. I would gladly 
share my extensive knowledge of said books with all who come in the door. I 
know that there are many other citizens that would join me in an effort to keep 
the library's doors open every Sunday, while promoting the excitement of 
reading. This would be an opportunity for all of us to provide a needed service 
to our community, and, at the same time, relieve paid librarians of covering an 
extra day. 
</P>
<P>
 Our libraries represent a significant public investment. As such, this 
resource needs to be open to all, daily. It is vital to our educational and 
cultural life. Learning is an everyday, lifelong process.

AFRICANS TAKE CONTROL OF AN OUTRAGE; A HOPEFUL MOMENT IN WAR-RIVEN LIBERIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's hard to imagine that peace may be at hand in Liberia after nearly four 
years of brutal civil war, fought largely along tribal allegiances. The three 
major rival groups are to begin to seat a transitional government in this West 
African nation and thousands of soldiers are expected to come forward and 
disarm starting Monday. To encourage this hopeful moment, the United Nations 
and the United States should raise the promise of threats if fighting resumes 
and of rewards if peace prevails. 
</P>
<P>
 If a transitional government is successfully installed, much of the credit 
will belong to West African troops from neighboring countries who intervened 
after Liberia descended into anarchy. Military intervention by the Economic 
Community of West African States is significant because it is a welcome 
departure from the traditional African stance of staying out of nations' 
internal conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 The peacekeepers represent an African solution to an African problem. Their 
presence is noteworthy also because of the fact that 10,000 peacekeepers have 
stayed more than three years at an expense that few African nations can easily 
afford. 
</P>
<P>
 To relieve some of the financial burden U.N. Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali asked Washington to airlift 1,700 soldiers from Tanzania and 
Uganda to Liberia. The Clinton Administration agreed, and the East African 
soldiers arrived in February. The airlift came in response to complaints from 
the best-known rebel leader, Charles Taylor, who moaned that the Nigerian 
soldiers who dominate the peacekeeping force were biased against him. Somehow 
Taylor, a stubborn combatant in the conflict, must be satisfied if the war is 
to end. Troublesome questions persist: Will Taylor accept a compromise short of 
his ascent to power? Will he stall in an effort to gain advantage? 
</P>
<P>
 Delays, the U.N. Security Council has warned Liberia, would result in the end 
of international support. Though most U.S. aid goes to humanitarian relief 
projects such as feeding malnourished Liberians, the Clinton Administration has 
committed $31 million to fund deployment of additional peacekeepers and provide 
limited support for existing West African troops. New fighting would jeopardize 
that help and the $40 million approved by the United Nations for a 300-person 
observer mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The enhanced American role is appropriate given the historic links between the 
two nations. About 16,400 former American slaves settled in Liberia early in 
the 19th Century. They imported U.S. traditions but sadly paid only lip service 
to democracy. Americo-Liberians also limited the control of government to 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Decades of mistreatment triggered a revolt in 1980 led by Samuel Doe, a 
Liberian army sergeant. Doe ran a government that perhaps was as corrupt as its 
predecessor and that rewarded his tribal group. His autocratic rule prompted 
the current power struggle, which has left 70,000 dead and forced 700,000 to 
become refugees. War has taken a terrible toll on Liberia, but the nation may 
finally be at a point where progress can begin. With pressure and encouragement 
from the United States and the United Nations, peace can prevail and democracy 
can take root. If that happens, a lot of the credit must go to the West African 
troop commitment.

BERNARDI AND CRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "Turning the Tables: CRA Buys Star on Walk of Fame for 
Longtime Critic," Feb. 26: 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps former City Councilman Ernani Bernardi's Walk of Fame star will shine 
bright on those Community Redevelopment Agency officials responsible for this 
"gotcha," and expose them for what they really are. For 32 years, he has been 
fighting these outlaws who are so articulate in redefining blight they have 
been able to sell their glamorous developments to the public without being 
accountable in any way. 
</P>
<P>
 Using tax dollars to purchase a star is but a hint of their irresponsible 
waste. Bernardi obviously recognizes this is being done by confiscating 
millions upon millions of hard-earned tax dollars from other desperately needed 
services, such as police and fire protection, and schools. Most people are not 
aware that redevelopment agencies do not answer to the voters or their elected 
representatives, that they are an administrative arm of the state, and they can 
create debt in inconceivable amounts that eventually must be paid from the 
income of the citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardi does know. Hopefully his star will shed some light so others can 
observe the horrors fathered by this much maligned and misunderstood back room 
of our government.

QUAKE TAX DEDUCTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I applaud your support for Rep. Howard L. Berman's (D-Panorama City) 
proposal to allow individuals to deduct all uninsured earthquake losses 
suffered in the Northridge earthquake from their federal income tax returns 
(editorial, Feb. 22). 
</P>
<P>
 I want to bring your attention to the fact that I've authored SB 561, which 
will provide relief identical to the Berman bill for individuals filing state 
income tax returns.SB 561 also allows a carry-over to future years of 100% of 
excess losses. Current law allows for only a 50% carry-over. 
</P>
<P>
 California's economic strength depends on the economic health of a dynamic 
Southern California. Southern California is at a crossroads. The next couple of 
years will determine whether Los Angeles regains its cultural and economic 
vitality or whether, like many Eastern cities, it becomes a place where only 
the very rich and the very poor live. 
</P>
<P>
 We must view the recent crisis as a beginning, not an end. We can help 
jump-start the economy by making sure that taxpayers in the San Fernando Valley 
and other areas damaged by the quake have some financial incentive to rebuild 
and stay here. Passage of both the state and federal measures is crucially tied 
to securing Los Angeles' future economic well-being.

RAMOS ON POLANCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was shocked by George Ramos' criticism of Assemblyman Richard Polanco 
(D-Los Angeles) on what appear to be nakedly racist grounds (Feb. 28). 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos condemns Polanco for supporting his aide, Bill Mabie, for an Assembly 
seat held by a Chicano.Polanco says he talked to several qualified Latinos 
about the race, and all turned him down. Polanco then said that in his opinion 
Mabie was the best candidate for the job, and that the voters would eventually 
decide. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos' response to what sounds like an elementary lesson in how the democratic 
process should work? "I don't buy Polanco's arguments. . . . What about helping 
your own kind. . . .?" 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently to Ramos "your own kind" is defined by the narrow bounds of race. 
Political philosophy and qualifications to serve should be subordinated to 
ethnicity. Based on that kind of thinking, someone like Rep. Xavier Becerra 
(D-Los Angeles), who represents a district where the vast majority of 
registered voters are not Latino, would not be elected, and Los Angeles will 
proceed down the path to becoming a mini-Bosnia, where ethnic background 
defines everything.

TROUBLED JOURNEY FOR DESERT PROTECTION; FEINSTEIN BILL IS ADVANCING, BUT IT'S 
UNDER AN ATTACK THAT COULD LEAVE IT ENFEEBLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The odyssey of the California Desert Protection Act through Congress threatens 
to become as long and torturous as the 19th-Century desert crossings of 
westbound pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
 The act would save special natural places from human-caused degradation. It 
would create the largest wilderness area in the lower 48 states, enlarging both 
Death Valley and Joshua Tree national monuments and upgrading them to national 
park status. The legislation also is intended to create a 1.2-million-acre East 
Mojave National Park, bounded roughly by the Nevada border and Interstate 
Highways 15 and 40. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, California has about 25 million acres of desert terrain in the 
expanses between the Inyo Mountains and Imperial County. The pressures of 
economic development like mining and of recreational activities like hunting 
and dirt-biking have prompted concerned Californians to seek to preserve some 
of this gorgeous and primitive land for future generations. It is these same 
economic and recreational pressures that threaten to derail or significantly 
undercut the act's protections. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein admirably took up the desert cause immediately after she 
joined the Senate. She has demonstrated her willingness to compromise to defuse 
reasonable concerns by miners and others. Feinstein has also shown that she can 
hold the line when necessary, until now resisting pressure from the National 
Rifle Assn. and motorcycle groups, which have opposed the bill because it would 
bar hunting and off-road vehicles from some lands where these activities 
currently are permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Feinstein's leadership, the desert bill has gone further than it has 
since it was introduced in 1986 by then-Sen. Alan Cranston. It passed out of 
the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee last fall and, for the first 
time, will go to the Senate floor for debate, possibly this month or next. 
</P>
<P>
 But Feinstein's victory -- and California's -- could be significantly 
diminished if she continues to accept amendments that undercut the basic goals 
of the act. Last fall, to move the bill to the Senate floor, she agreed to 
exclude a 290,000-acre parcel from the proposed Mojave National Park. Removing 
this parcel, which contains historical sites, Native American petroglyphs and 
pristine habitat, would carve a big hole in the planned park and make it more 
difficult for the Park Service to effectively manage surrounding parklands. 
</P>
<P>
 Other amendments under discussion would downgrade some parcels from park 
status to that of national hunting preserve, permitting hunting along with 
tourism.  
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein must keep this bill on track, remembering that the fragile desert 
needs protection from the people who use it.

HELPING HAND FOR APARTMENT OWNERS; REVISED FEDERAL PROGRAMS ARE BROUGHT INTO 
PLAY IN AFTERMATH OF THE EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A major challenge to rebuilding the parts of Southern California ravaged by 
the Northridge earthquake lies in restoring damaged residential rental units. 
The huge shortage of affordable rentals that now exists poses the biggest 
multifamily housing problem in the nation, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the more than 250,000 residential structures damaged in the earthquake, 
88%, or about 220,000, were apartment units. The damage to these apartment 
buildings is estimated at close to $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Many families were displaced from their homes, and as these tenants scattered 
to shelters or the homes of relatives their former landlords often feared that 
declining property values would make repairs not worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. In an 
unprecedented effort to help apartment owners rebuild and tenants return, HUD 
Secretary Henry G. Cisneros recently made available various financing plans to 
repair and rebuild apartment units. Disaster relief programs had been skewed 
toward helping homeowners rather than apartment owners. 
</P>
<P>
 That certainly was the case in the aftermath of the 1989 Loma Prieta 
earthquake. A recent UC Berkeley study found that disaster recovery efforts 
after that temblor failed to provide the assistance needed to restore 
affordable apartments. Three-fourths of the 12,000 housing units lost in the 
Bay Area earthquake were in multifamily buildings and about half remain 
unrepaired or unreplaced four years later. In contrast, homeowners received 62% 
of the more than $1 billion in housing relief provided for the Bay Area, even 
though single-family homes accounted for only 40% of the damaged units. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD and other agencies, in light of these findings, now are seeking to 
encourage apartment rebuilding. The Small Business Administration will try to 
make more apartment owners aware of its loan programs. Los Angeles city housing 
officials announced a new federally backed $30-million low-interest program for 
owners of damaged rental units, enabling them to borrow up to $15,000 per unit 
for repairs. In addition, the state treasurer has agreed to purchase a 
$145-million bond from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, with 
proceeds going to finance earthquake repair loans. 
</P>
<P>
 So apartment owners now have greater alternatives and resources to rebuild and 
hang on to their investments. But in taking advantage of these new programs, 
apartment owners also assume an obligation to use the funds to restore 
affordable rental units and honor the rights of their former tenants.

FIREFIGHTER EXAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am appalled that Los Angeles is barring white males from its firefighter 
examination. We need our firefighters to be the best qualified individuals 
available.A firefighter today needs to be able to understand the treatment of 
hazardous materials. They need to be able to do the complex hydrodynamic 
calculations to determine how many, and what sizes of hose lines can be 
supported. And of course, a firefighter still needs the strength to carry a 
victim (possibly another firefighter) out of a hazardous area. 
</P>
<P>
 I, for one, don't care whether a firefighter is male, female, black, yellow, 
brown, green, or even white. That doesn't matter. What matters is having the 
best qualified individuals available in times of emergency. Barring 5,000 
individuals from taking the examination is ensuring that our new firefighters 
will not be the most qualified individuals as our firefighters. This is neither 
equal opportunity nor fair to the public.

THREE DIGITS FRAUGHT WITH MEANING; AREA CODES: THERE ARE SECRETS APLENTY IN 
THESE NUMBERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SCHMIDT, Los Angeles writer Robert Schmidt is finishing a book on 
job-hunting. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My friend the numerologist says that nothing happens by chance. The Soviet 
Union fell according to Nostradamus, the stars foretell the future and messages 
are concealed everywhere. Even a seemingly innocuous choice, such as a region's 
area code, is fraught with subliminal meaning. The analysis: 
</P>
<P>
 213 (Los Angeles): The assorted low numbers indicate a mixed, working-class 
area without pretensions. The gritty, industrial heart of Southern California. 
See also 312 (Chicago). 
</P>
<P>
 310 (Los Angeles): Similar numbers, but their formal pattern (an arrangement 
divisible by 10) denotes a more highbrow, ritualized, sterile environment. The 
Westside and Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 818 (San Fernando Valley): The pair of large numbers bookending the digit 
indicates an area of old-fashioned, stand-up values. The Valley before its most 
recent demographic shifts. See also 515 (Iowa). 
</P>
<P>
 714 (Orange Country): The seven implies good fortune, a break with the past, 
but the trailing four says this area is anchored by old patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 415 (San Francisco): A four faces its twisted reflection, a five, across a 
divide. Just off-center enough to suggest the non-traditional pairings of this 
sexual hothouse. See also 504 (New Orleans). 
</P>
<P>
 212 (Manhattan): Twos over one hint at coiled strength, an eagle about to 
soar. But the numbers are too small for this powerhouse, suggesting a certain 
pettiness. The Ross Perot of area codes. 
</P>
<P>
 305 (Miami): The forward-looking three indicates a vibrant populace on the 
rise, but the five hidden behind the zero alludes to an odd, consuming secret 
-- the obsession with liberating Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 202 (Washington): A pair of even, staid twos bookend an empty core. The 
perfect metaphor for our faceless, bureaucratic capital. Compare with 501 
(Arkansas) -- all bluster up front, no substance behind. 
</P>
<P>
 801 (Utah): The up-front eight stands for God's infinite reach, but watch out 
for the sneaky one. Does it represent the Devil mocking righteous piety?

PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO WOULD WILLFULLY ABUSE THE PUBLIC TRUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kevin Starr, Kevin Starr, a contributing editor to Opinion, teaches in the 
School of Urban and Regional Planning at USC and formerly served as city 
librarian of San Francisco. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The refusal of the Librarians' Guild to consider Sunday a normal work day at 
the Central Library threatens to make a mockery of the newly renovated 
$200-million-plus facility. Meanwhile, the Police Protective League threatens 
to distribute a videotape to travel and convention officials across the nation 
that depicts Los Angeles as an unsafe city -- if the police union doesn't get 
its contract. This behavior, by the librarians and the police, strikes yet 
another blow at the cause of true unionism in Southern California. In each 
case, union leaders are pitting their unions against working people. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the Central Library reopened in October, it has been packed with 
visitors on Sundays, most of them Angelenos of ordinary income. Let's face it: 
The work week fills Monday through Friday to the brim. With the Northridge 
earthquake having lengthened nearly all commutes in an already intense commute 
environment, the work week is longer than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 For most, Saturday is for shopping and the dozens of errands that must be run 
each week to keep a household functioning. That leaves Sunday as the one day 
working Angelenos can enjoy a moment of respite, an opportunity for worship, 
for family gatherings, for recreation -- and for that special refreshment of 
mind that a great public library offers. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, the Librarians' Guild tells us that it will not consider this day a 
day of ordinary service. They want to be paid double-time for working Sunday, 
if they agree to work at all. They reject the option of volunteers, as 
suggested by Mayor Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Disingenuously, the librarians give the people classic Orwellian doublespeak. 
They say they cannot give us the level of service on Sunday they can during the 
week, so we should come to the library during the week -- despite the fact that 
this is impossible for the vast majority of working people. Who are they 
kidding? Their response recalls the American major in Vietnam who told a 
television correspondent that his unit had to destroy a village in order to 
save it. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, the Police Protective League offers equal scandal with its 
threat to strike at the core of the L.A. economy. Sworn to preserve and to 
protect the citizens of Los Angeles, it would endanger the jobs of hundreds of 
thousands of ordinary citizens to get its way at the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, highly regarded public servants are scandalizing the public 
that looks to them for guidance and protection. Librarians -- public librarians 
especially -- stand for the idea that all Americans, regardless of income or 
social status, should have access to books and information, as a matter of 
economic and intellectual survival. Similarly, the theory of policing in a 
democracy embodies the notion that the protection of life and property is a 
service extended equally to all citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 So why do librarians tell people they cannot use the library on Sunday? Why do 
the police threaten to undercut that part of the local economy that generates 
most entry-level jobs? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is irresponsible unionism. I emphasize the word irresponsible , for 
true unionism has brought innumerable benefits to working America. Just ask any 
undocumented worker in the region or, conversely, any woebegone yuppie working 
seven days a week, 10 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, the Librarians' Guild has no right to take the library away from 
the working people on Sunday, and the Police Protective League has no right to 
disrupt the economic well-being of the citizens whose taxes pay the salaries of 
its members and whose welfare they are sworn to protect. Librarianship and 
police service are positions of deep trust between citizen and public servant. 
No union has a right to violate that trust. 
</P>
<P>
 The public sector performed magnificently after the Northridge quake. Perhaps 
that is why Riordan is not taking on the librarians and the police. Up until 
the earthquake, Riordan frequently talked about privatizing certain municipal 
services. The German-based Bertelsmann Foundation has recently selected Phoenix 
as one of the best-run cities in the world, precisely because it has 
successfully privatized many of its municipal services.  
</P>
<P>
 If the librarians at the Central Library do not wish to work on Sundays, one 
can easily imagine a private company of professional librarians being formed 
that would bid to run the Central Library seven days a week at a competitive 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The police question is more complex. A police force should not be privatized, 
lest it become the exclusive preserve of privilege. The police hold a special 
position in our society. Sworn officers, their lives on the line every working 
day, are akin, in many respects, to clergy in their status and 
responsibilities, although most cops would cringe, even guffaw, to hear the 
comparison. (Still, the uniform of the Los Angeles Police Department is almost 
clerical in color and cut, and a rabbi serves as president of the Police 
Commission.) That's why the abuse of laity by clergy or the abuse of citizens 
by the police is such a heinous offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan must address each of these unions. To the Librarians' Guild and the 
Police Protective League, he must say: "Serve the people. Do not offer them 
scandal. Do not betray their trust. Bargain fairly. Negotiate reasonably. Don't 
threaten the people."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: HUDSUCKER INDUSTRIES 
PROVES NO MATCH FOR WHAM-O 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY BRENNAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wham-O generally makes anyone planning to use its trademark toys run through 
countless legal hoops, but when it came to Joel and Ethan Coen's "The Hudsucker 
Proxy," getting the corporate vote was practically a snap. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Gabriel-based makers of the Hula-Hoop and its parent Kransco Group -- 
known for its aggressive litigious behavior when it comes to protecting its 
trademarks -- saw a potential windfall with the Coens' plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The 36-year-old hoop, which plays a pivotal role as the brainchild of star Tim 
Robbins in the film opening Friday, was the country's first fad toy, launched 
in 1958 after Wham-O's founders, Arthur Melin and Richard Knerr, saw Australian 
kids using a bamboo hoop in school exercise and decided to spin off a lighter, 
plastic version of their own. It far surpassed the sales of their flying disc, 
the Frisbee, which had been introduced a year earlier. The first year, 20 
million Hula-Hoops were sold. By the close of 1959, the number twirled past 100 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot of "Hudsucker" spins on the real-life success of the toy. But the 
Coens' version has darker tones. A 1958 business-school graduate, Norville 
Barnes (Robbins), takes a job at Hudsucker Industries in New York, where the 
founder has just leaped from a 44-story window. Hudsucker's board plots to take 
over the profitable company by putting a simpleton -- Barnes -- at the top to 
ruin Hudsucker, driving down the stock so they can scoop it up and take 
control. But Barnes comes up with a toy, the Hula-Hoop, that's a wild success, 
derailing their scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot was dark enough for the Kransco Group to demand this disclaimer at 
the end of the film's credits: "The foregoing was a fictional account of 
development of the Hula-Hoop and the characters bear no resemblance to any real 
person or business concern. The Hula-Hoop was actually developed by the 
founders of the toy company Wham-O a true American success story. Wham-O was 
subsequently responsible for the development of the Frisbee and numerous other 
toy products."  
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to make sure the hoop would not be used to hurt or maim 
somebody," says Pat Murphy, the Coens' attorney, who negotiated with Kransco 
for use of the hoop. "We sent them a one-page synopsis outlining how we would 
use the toy, and they wanted to see the script. It was an amusement for us, 
since their requests really had nothing to do with the Hula-Hoop." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very protective; if you aren't, you lose your mark -- just look at 
aspirin and the escalator," says Stuart Schneck, vice president and general 
counsel for Kransco. "But Barbie, Disney and Nike are even worse than us." 
</P>
<P>
 But why the Hula-Hoop? 
</P>
<P>
 "Barnes had to surprise everybody with an idea that seemed idiotic," says 
producer Ethan Coen. "And what he came up with was this circle, the hoop, that 
became the quintessentially wild, fad toy. The Hula-Hoop just fit." 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of "Hudsucker," guess what toy pops up as the next brainstorm 
product of the dimwitted Barnes -- and guess who planted the idea? 
</P>
<P>
 " I suggested the Frisbee at the end of the movie," says Schneck. "Pretty 
clever, don't you think?" 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect has Schneck smiling. While Wham-O did not ask for any money for 
the rights to use the Hula-Hoop, it also didn't have to fork any over for what 
is undoubtedly the product-placement coup of the season. The company, in fact, 
is planning major advertising tie-ins with the movie, and hopes to reinvigorate 
the hoop fad. As Schneck says: "No can lose."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: THE NEXT '12 ANGRY MEN'? 
WELL, THE BIDDING WAS FURIOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE GALBRAITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood is falling all over itself in a rush to make the next generation of 
courtroom dramas. Out is the fictional whodunit, good guy vs. bad guy variety. 
In is the true-life, criminal as victim case. Witness its thirst in adapting 
the Menendez and Bobbitt trials as entertainment.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, joining those screaming-headline stories is the case of . . . Martin 
Kaplan? 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone lines recently heated up among agents, directors, producers and 
studios over who would win the film rights to an accounting of Kaplan's 
paradox-ridden Manhattan trial -- the subject of a first-person article in the 
New Yorker by journalist-juror William Finnegan titled "A Reporter at Large: 
Doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 The 17,000-word story ran in the Jan. 31 issue; its sale to United Artists was 
completed less than three weeks after publication. 
</P>
<P>
 In his piece, Finnegan recounts why he voted to help convict Kaplan of an 
assault and robbery that took place at the Astor Place subway station in 
Manhattan last year, despite his gut feelings that the case had holes. The two 
men who were robbed and beaten seemed certain that Kaplan was one of their 
three muggers. 
</P>
<P>
 But following Kaplan's conviction and at his sentencing, Finnegan encountered 
one of the convicted felon's ex-girlfriends in the elevator and was struck by 
the very different impression she conveyed in person than the low-class one she 
made on the witness stand. She was, in fact, the multilingual daughter of 
well-educated Chileans and supported herself as a free-lance translator for 
various government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 His conversation with the woman spurred him to reinvestigate, on his own, 
witnesses' accounts of where Kaplan was the night of the crime and other facts 
he found had been skewed or omitted by attorneys for both sides. It also caused 
him to write an account of his first-time jury experience for the New Yorker -- 
refashioning the tone of his piece midstream as events and interviews affected 
his beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the crux of Finnegan's article is not that the letter of the law 
wasn't observed in Kaplan's arrest, trial and conviction. He believes it was -- 
and says so at the end of his piece. More, it was that evidence that either was 
not admissible in court (like Kaplan's prior record) or was incomplete would 
have weakened the prosecution's case and perhaps changed the outcome of the 
trial.  
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan's alibi, supported by witnesses, was that he had been eating at an East 
Village cafe. Police said he was caught with traces of blood on his hands. The 
victims had been bloodied too. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kaplan's attorney, not wanting to prejudice jurors, kept from them the 
knowledge that Kaplan was a heroin addict with a long rap sheet, who often 
injured himself breaking into cars to support his habit. His record also showed 
a pattern of stealing, but only one arrest for assault, which was dismissed. In 
collect phone calls from prison, Kaplan told Finnegan that he bled from "an 
abscess on my arm where I had been sticking a needle into it." 
</P>
<P>
 As the author said in an interview: "My further conversations with alibi 
witnesses and with Kaplan have pushed me deeper into doubt that he did it. It's 
not that I've come up with new evidence or novel arguments . . . it's just that 
things keep meshing so that (his) alibi makes as much or more sense than the 
prosecution's theory of the crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly "12 Angry Men," but close enough, said ICM agent Irene Webb, who 
successfully brokered the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Fittingly, it was "Prince of the City's" Academy Award-nominated writer Jay 
Presson Allen who read Finnegan's piece and, according to both UA production 
vice president Jeff Kleeman and Finnegan himself, initiated its sale to 
Hollywood by pal UA President John Calley. Though UA was the victor -- 
reportedly agreeing to pay in the low six-figure range if the movie is produced 
-- it first had to outbid such rival producers as Gale Anne Hurd, Lynda Obst 
and Tony Bill, among others, as well as Universal Pictures, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finnegan, 41, known more for his reporting on South Africa and Central 
America, said he was "delighted" to have sold his first property to Hollywood. 
He has heard from neither attorney nor the judge. Kaplan, Finnegan said, 
nitpicked about one detail, while his alibi witnesses said they "liked the 
piece."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: STILL SEEKING, NO 
DESPERATION; THE DIRECTOR OF 'DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN' ENDS HER SELF-IMPOSED 
HIATUS WITH AN OSCAR NOMINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Sitting in a dark SoHo cafe sipping cappuccino, Susan Seidelman blends easily 
with her bohemian neighbors. Her five-foot frame and unfussy beauty take almost 
a decade off of her 40 years. Where has she been? Fans desperately seeking 
Seidelman the past several years needed only look to where her best movies are 
set -- the not-always-kind streets of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 After the unexpected success of her first two films, "Smithereens" in 1982 and 
"Desperately Seeking Susan" in 1985, the director reeled off a succession of 
innocuous movies. Then, discouraged by Hollywood's tendency to suck her vision 
from her films, and thrilled by an unexpected pregnancy discovered while she 
was filming the underwhelming "She-Devil" in 1989, Seidelman simply stopped. 
For several years, she has been on a strict movie-making hiatus, filling her 
days with diapers, bedtime stories and researching nursery schools. The break, 
she says, nurtured her movie-making as much as it has her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like you're on the treadmill, afraid each movie may be your last," says 
Seidelman in a soothing no-nonsense voice. "You're afraid to step back, take 
time off and fill your head up with new ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Seidelman, just back from a stint on the Berlin Film Festival jury, is 
hard at work again. Her Academy Award-nominated short "The Dutch Master" was 
the first work out of the gate, but she also has three scripts in development. 
And always, there is her 4-year-old son -- named, as it happens, Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Dutch Master" came about after an encounter in Paris last year between 
Seidelman, who had just lost financing for a feature project, and German 
producer Regina Ziegler, who had been a Seidelman fan since "Smithereens." 
Ziegler was funding a series of 12 erotic shorts and asked Seidelman to direct 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the sense of humor and keen observation that comes across in all her 
films," says Ziegler. "Susan is a great storyteller, which is so important for 
the 30-minute form." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ziegler's loose guidelines appealed to Seidelman, who set to work on the 
project with her longtime collaborator and companion (and father of Oscar), 
Jonathan Brett. 
</P>
<P>
 Seidelman and Brett were cruising through the Louvre when an idea hit them. 
"We thought, 'Wouldn't it be great to escape into one of these paintings?' " 
Seidelman says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dutch style appealed because of its realism (it would be easy to paint in 
the actors' faces and bring a scene to life), moody sensuality, rich colors and 
a tendency for the scenery to include doors and windows, suggesting an 
offscreen area. "You could create your own reality beyond the actual scene in 
the painting," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Dutch Master's" heroine, like so many of Seidelman's female characters, 
seeks a fantasy life more interesting than her real one. She is a dental 
hygienist from Brooklyn, who escapes her sterile existence cleaning teeth by 
stepping, quite literally, into 17th-Century Amsterdam and a sensual adventure. 
(The film will be shown at Cannes, and there are plans to attach it to two 
other Ziegler shorts and release it theatrically later this year.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a pretty wild fantasy life," Seidelman says. "On the surface, even if 
a lot of other people think your life is really interesting, it's hard work, 
and there are responsibilities, so the idea of being able to escape into 
another reality is something I know women in particular think about." 
</P>
<P>
 While the $500,000 budget was low for Seidelman, the project allowed her 
something she felt she had lost in her bigger pictures: artistic freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 After "Desperately Seeking Susan," Seidelman had big budgets at her disposal 
and pressure to match. "It's like a writer whose first book is a big 
bestseller," says Seidelman. "Their second book never is as good because 
they've got people looking over their shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
 Studios wanted her to make "Susan" over and over, and though she allows 
Hollywood movies are a different beast from independents, she never got the 
hang of it. "If someone's giving you $15 million or $20 million to make a 
movie, they have something to say about it," says Seidelman, referring to her 
three box-office disappointments -- "Making Mr. Right," "Cookie" and the Meryl 
Streep/Roseanne Barr comedy, "She-Devil." "If you're really successful, they 
let you do what you want -- I'm not. I have to fight for it." 
</P>
<P>
 But right now Seidelman isn't grumbling. She says her fondest memories are of 
her very first movie because there were no preconceptions. "Smithereens," made 
for a mere $60,000, was compromise-free. "Ignorance is bliss," she says. 
"Sometimes I wish I didn't know as much as I do about how the movie business 
works."  
</P>
<P>
 She does look back, though. "I don't know how I feel about 'She-Devil.' On 
some levels it was a disappointment. Do I think it's a bad movie or not, I 
don't know. One gets very influenced by what the critics say or what the box 
office is, and I'm not sure if that's a fair judge of what a movie is." 
</P>
<P>
 Seidelman discovered the only sure way to avoid being labeled as forever in a 
sophomore slump: to disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've watched a lot of movies and saw what I did wrong, but I really feel like 
I know a lot more now," she says. With "The Dutch Master" and a lineup of 
promising projects focusing on strong urban women, Seidelman is delving back 
into the scene with her unique brand of social satire.  
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, motherhood has made sure things will never be quite the same 
-- including Manhattan, her home of 16 years. "If you're on your own, there's a 
way to live cheaply -- there's a whole funky artsy thing you do here. With a 
child, it gets more complicated." For now, she says, one child is enough. "I 
really like the one I have. But you never know. This one was a bit of a 
surprise, and it turned out great." 
</P>
<P>
 She spends her days at home in her SoHo loft reading scripts and talking on 
the phone with writers and producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Choosing to live in New York over Los Angeles was more than a reaction to her 
suburban Philadelphia upbringing. The street culture, the people and even the 
ugliness of the city all play major parts in her movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "In New York, you're constantly bombarded with stuff. So a lot of the women in 
the films I make have that slightly cut-throat kind of energy," she says. "You 
also get frazzled. You feel life pummeling you a bit. But I thrive on it."

STAGE WATCH: WILL 'ISLAND' CYCLE FLOAT INTO THE TAPER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First there was "The Kentucky Cycle," then "Angels in America." But now a 
whole year has gone by without a two-part epic at the Mark Taper Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Never fear -- Taper programmers are trying to bring Eduardo Machado's Cuba 
cycle, "The Floating Island Plays," to the Taper next season. 
</P>
<P>
 The first three of the "Island Plays" ("The Modern Ladies of Guanabacoa," 
"Fabiola," "In the Eye of the Hurricane") follow several Cuban families from 
1928 through Castro's revolution. The last, "Broken Eggs," is set at a Cuban 
American wedding reception in Woodland Hills in 1979. Machado's own family 
emigrated from Cuba to the San Fernando Valley when he was 8, and he lived in 
the area until he moved to New York at the age of 27. He's now 40. 
</P>
<P>
 The plays have been staged separately -- including a production of "Fabiola" 
at L.A.'s Ensemble Studio Theatre in 1985 -- but they haven't been presented as 
a package. They were published in a single volume in 1991 by Theatre 
Communications Group, but Machado has been rewriting them in recent months. The 
published text still could be used for individual productions, he said last 
week, but when they are presented as a group, he prefers the rewrites, which 
trim some of the exposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Oskar Eustis, the Taper's associate artistic director until June, has been 
working with Machado on the rewrites and plans to direct the Taper production, 
despite his brand-new job as artistic director of Trinity Repertory Company in 
Providence, R.I. Eustis said the "Island Plays" mean so much to him that he 
stipulated in his Trinity contract that he would be able to return to Los 
Angeles to direct them. He performed similar dramaturge/directing duties on 
"Angels in America." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest roadblock is money. Eustis declined to specify a budget estimate. 
But he cautioned that the production could cost more than any other production 
in Taper history -- although the budget for the upcoming "Bandido!" might 
provide some competition for that title. The "Island Plays" call for a cast of 
13, "radically different locations" and lavish costumes, Eustis said -- "These 
people knew how to dress." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Island Plays" have whipped up the kind of enthusiasm around the Taper 
that usually means something will be produced, Eustis said. Talk has centered 
on the possibility of presenting the plays next fall. But Taper artistic 
director Gordon Davidson has yet to give the final go-ahead. ("No decisions get 
made without Gordon," said Eustis. "We pretend but we're all really children.") 
</P>
<P>
 Machado's work on the "Island Plays" and on several other Taper projects is 
being supported by a $100,000 grant from the National Theatre Artist Residency 
Program, financed by Pew Charitable Trusts and administered by Theatre 
Communications Group. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the "Island Plays," he's writing "From His P.O.V.," a play 
about AIDS in the Latino community, for P.L.A.Y., the Taper's youth theater. 
He's also consulting on season planning and helping run the theater's Mentor 
Playwright Program, where he has already taught for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 One project he's not doing at the Taper was, nonetheless, commissioned by the 
Taper: "Across a Crowded Room," a play about "the meaning of talent," focusing 
on the daughter of a famous Broadway composer in 1939. Although the Taper 
passed on it, Machado now hopes to take it to Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Machado said that he had no time to accept an invitation to 
collaborate with Tony Kushner on the La Jolla Playhouse adaptation of "The Good 
Person of Setzuan" this summer. Poetic justice, perhaps? The Taper had to 
postpone Kushner's "The Heavenly Theatre," which had been scheduled for this 
summer, because of Kushner's commitments to a variety of other projects, 
including "Setzuan." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "WAITING" WINS: The show that replaced "The Heavenly Theatre" on the Taper 
schedule, Lisa Loomer's "The Waiting Room," won one of two second place awards 
in the annual Susan Smith Blackburn program, while the Taper's show from last 
June, "Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992," won an honorable mention. Loomer's prize 
of $1,000 was the highest award to an American in this year's competition, 
which is open to women who write plays for the English-speaking theater. First 
place went to Jane Coles, a London writer, for her "Backstroke in a Crowded 
Pool." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MONEY FOR MUSICALS?: The new San Diego Music Theatre is trying to drum up 
money for its first season. If enough can be raised, the group plans to present 
a revival of the 1954 Harold Rome/Joshua Logan/S.N. Behrman musical "Fanny," at 
San Diego Civic Theatre in October -- the first in a three-show season. Founder 
and general director is Gregory Allen Hirsch, a lighting designer and former 
director of production for San Diego Opera. Artistic director is Albert Marre, 
director of the original "Kismet" and "Man of La Mancha."

 It is possible to lead a full and happy, or (speaking from personal 
experience) a reasonably long life, without loving the more ambitious, in some 
quarters fanatically admired, works of that dumpiest of late-Romantics, Sir 
Edward Elgar. 
</P>
<P>
 Mind you, we are not talking about his exquisitely crafted miniatures, such as 
the String Serenade, the Introduction and Allegro, the "Chansons du 
Matin/Nuit," etc., but the big, bottom-heavy symphonies, which scream out for 
editorial liposuction, the immobile oratorios and the maundering Violin 
Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
 That is until recently when the Concerto was heard on the car radio, music at 
once familiar if not immediately identifiable, and most appealingly schmaltzy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Elgar Violin Concerto, written in 1910, when composers should have been 
doing something else, or at least doing it in a less Brahmsian way, is 
available for listening at home via a just-arrived recording from Kyoko 
Takezawa, a young artist whose several previous recordings have led one to 
expect an alert, fresh approach, with Colin Davis conducting the Bavarian Radio 
Symphony (RCA Victor 61612). 
</P>
<P>
 Takezawa projects that slow movement with full, variegated tone, a caressing 
lyric line, enhancing rubatos and a seemingly innate comprehension of how best 
to communicate the composer's sighing dynamics and subtle tempo shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Listening backward (as only a neophyte is permitted to do), to the opening 
movement, revealed unsuspected beauties often obscured by the blubber. The 
bombastic finale -- when Elgar pulls out the trombones, duck! -- however, 
remains resistant to any performer's efforts on its behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, conductor Davis, once an outspoken anti-Elgarian himself, seems 
in recent years to have found things to love in the music, as exhibited by the 
sympathetic, if occasionally too loose-limbed, framework he provides for his 
young soloist and, without her services, in the makeweight, the gorgeous 
Introduction and Allegro for strings. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second Elgar Violin Concerto in recent months from 
generous-to-a-fault RCA. The previous version is performed by Pinchas Zukerman, 
whose playing is at times more swoopily lush than Takezawa's, at others 
disconcertingly matter of fact, which hers never is. 
</P>
<P>
 Zukerman's partners are the Saint Louis Symphony, whose taut accompaniment 
under Leonard Slatkin adds welcome muscle to Elgar's structure but misses some 
of the appealing sentimentality that Davis unashamedly projects. The filler 
here is Elgar's brief, charming and familiar "Salut d'amour." 
</P>
<P>
 Reminder: The RCA catalogue lists yet another Elgar Violin Concerto, Jascha 
Heifetz's high-speed 1949 recording: brilliant, tough and, in its highly 
personal way, hugely impressive on the mid-priced CD (7966) it shares with the 
Walton Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
 The one large-scale Elgar work everyone seems to love -- possibly because of 
its associations with the lamented Jacqueline du Pre -- is the Cello Concerto, 
dating from a decade after the Violin Concerto and in which not a note or 
notion is wasted, as if in apology for the excesses of its predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 In a live recording made in Moscow in 1964 (Russian Disc 11104), Mstislav 
Rostropovich's interpretation offers, in addition to the expected glories of 
tone, a striking combination of rhapsodic freedom and rhythmic acumen: knowing 
exactly how much shaping a melodic line can bear without becoming segmented. 
</P>
<P>
 Conductor Gennady Rozhdestvensky and the Moscow Philharmonic do more than 
support the soloist, they breathe with him, here and in the two attractive 
rarities that complete the program, Respighi's "Adagio con variazioni" and 
Milhaud's First Cello Concerto.

 BRIGITTE FASSBAENDER. Schubert Lieder, with Cord Garben, piano. Sony SK 53 
104. In these 24 songs to Goethe texts, Fassbaender shows it is possible to use 
an unremarkable instrument and still achieve telling lyric and dramatic points 
in Schubert.The bottom notes are mostly taken on faith and the top can 
occasionally be a stretch -- the Berlin-born mezzo is now 55 -- but her low-key 
approach to such dramatic giants of the repertory as "Erlkonig" and "Ganymed" 
eschews an "operatic" approach and is all the more effective for it. A 
deceptively simple, but lovingly controlled "Meeres Stille," the three Mignon 
songs, especially a limpid "Kennst du das Land," are standouts, as is the 
gentle humor of "Liebhaber in allen Gestalten." Most singers should pray for a 
collaborator as knowing and sensitive as Garben. WALTER PRICE

 WAGNER: "Der Fliegende Hollander." Alfred Muff, Ingrid Haubold, Erich Knodt, 
Peter Seiffert, others; Austrian Radio Symphony, Pinchas Steinberg, 
conductor.Naxos 8.660025-26. Pinchas Steinberg's Wagner is a sometime thing, 
his reading of the overture limp and pallid. Muff is forced to sing "Die Frist 
is um," apparently in the crow's nest of his ship, far away and covered by the 
orchestra at the crucial points. Haubold is a quavery Senta with hit-or-miss 
top notes. In the absence of any tension or drive from Steinberg, she and her 
bass-baritone flounder in the great Act II duet. Knodt is an underpowered, 
phlegmatic Daland. Seiffert provides a sweet-voiced, intense Erik, the only 
adequately cast singer in the lot. WALTER PRICE

 DURUFLE: Requiem, Opus 9; Four Motets, Opus 10. Master Chorale of Orange 
County, conducted by William Hall. Martha-Jane Weaver, mezzo-soprano, Richard 
Fredricks, baritone, Ladd Thomas, organ.Summit DCD 134. Hall leads his 
150-member choir in lush and fluid performances of Durufle's most popular work 
and the stylistically homogeneous publication that followed after a break of 
over two decades. Weaver and Fredricks treat texts with sensitivity during solo 
passages in the Requiem, but Fredricks' wide vibrato hinders his efforts. Amid 
the friendly acoustics of St. Andrews Presbyterian Church, Newport Beach, 
textures emerge gratifyingly transparent, handsomely complemented by Thomas' 
polished accompaniment -- on the 93-rank, four-manual Casavant Freres Limitee. 
The a cappella motets offer the chorus ample opportunity to display its assets 
through seamless legatos, crystalline voicing and -- except for some 
uncharacteristic, over-sibilation in "Tantum ergo" -- crisp enunciation.SUSAN

 THREE SONG RECITALS. Erna Berger, soprano; Gunther Weissenborn and Michael 
Raucheisen, pianists. Koch 3-1058-2. Between October, 1950, and September, 
1951, when she was 50 years old, Berger gave three recitals in Berlin.This set 
represents the best culled from the performances. They are brilliant examples 
of the seemingly lost art of Lieder programming. Berger sounds younger than 
most half her age, but, more important, she has a musical inquisitiveness, a 
solid technique and a voice -- not large, but pure, beautiful and projected 
with the accuracy of a laser -- still in prime condition that allowed her 
complete freedom to roam the song literature. She was always ideal for Strauss 
and here both the Brentano cycle and the Ophelia songs are sung with a glow 
that, if anything, increases with "Wiegenlied" and "Schlechtes Wetter." She 
does not neglect the Schubert, Schumann and Brahms repertory either, but she 
reminds us the latter wasn't the only one to set a lovely "Immer leiser wird 
mein Schlummer"; Pfitzner did, too. Her curiosity leads her to three melismatic 
Turina songs (in Spanish), as well as Britten's Two Michelangelo Sonnets (in 
Italian). A curiosity is Werner Egk's specially commissioned aria to be 
inserted in the "Barbiere" Lesson Scene. There is not an ugly or unmusical 
sound to be heard throughout the three evenings. Of note: Her pianist, 
Raucheisen, was the husband of one of Berger's mentors, the great Maria Ivogun.

 GIUSEPPE DE LUCA: Arias, duets and ensembles. Giuseppe de Luca, baritone; 
various other singers, orchestras and conductors. Pearl GEMM CD 9967.These 
recordings, from 1906 to 1930, show a slender, focused, essentially lyric 
baritone used with impeccable taste and skill to forge a long career. 
Essentially, not much changes in the sound. Malatesta in "Pasquale" would seem 
to be an ideal part, sung as it is here in a duet with Lucrezia Bori. Yet De 
Luca could summon power and a variety of dramatic accents and be equally 
impressive in such heavier challenges as Rigoletto, Amonasro (the Nile Scene 
duet with Elisabeth Rethberg -- most baritones would kill for the grandeur and 
breath control he exhibits in the "Pensa che un popolo" section) and Carlo in 
"Ernani" (the Tomb Scene). He never lost the suavity of tone, as he shows in 
the "Pearl Fishers" duet with Beniamino Gigli, made when he was 54 years old. 
The engineers have chosen to retain the original surface noise rather than 
compromise the often impressive voice fidelity of the originals. WALTER PRICE

 Barron delivers, as usual. Here's another first-rate program of engaging 
originals, and a pair of standards, presented with elan by a dynamic cast: 
Bobby Hutcherson (vibes), Ralph Moore (saxes), Rufus Reid (bass), Victor Lewis 
(drums) and Mino Cinelu (percussion). 
</P>
<P>
 The leader, arguably the finest modern mainstream pianist around, balances the 
recording between vibrant, upbeat numbers, which swing like mad and demand 
energized improvisations from the crew, and more somber, thoughtful pieces, 
which allow for more emotional statements. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, there's a dark edge to the fast "Anywhere," but that mood is all 
but forgotten when the subsequent and oozing slow "Other Places" arrives. 
Likewise, the thrust of "Wildlife" is countered by the ballad "I Should Care." 
</P>
<P>
 The soloists are beyond reproach. Hutcherson constantly plays enthusiastic, 
intelligent lines, Moore mixes sharply separated tones with gushing bursts and 
Barron ties small strands of appealing ideas into alluring wholes.

silly, doesn't it? About as silly as most of this album. Hammer has 
opportunistically shifted genres now that pop rap, which he rode to 
superstardom, is on the skids. The problem is that Hammer has zero feel for 
gangsta rap. The album is not a total disaster, thanks to some smashing beats 
and the unbelievably funky "Don't Stop" -- but it's close.

 It's tempting to view R&B and country music as parallel rails forming the 
tracks of American popular music, as equal but separate traditions whose 
dichotomies -- hard-bitten vs sentimental, release vs. restraint, horns vs. 
pedal steel -- are irreconcilable. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course the stereotypes don't hold.The two genres have always intermingled, 
so the conceit of cultural breakthrough that accompanies "Rhythm, Country & 
Blues" -- an album bringing together singers and songs from both fields -- 
rings a little hollow. But if you're interested in the human rather than the 
historical scale, it has its moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Green and Lyle Lovett's "Funny How Time Slips Away" is an inspired meeting 
of the most elastic of voices and the most tightly wound. Vince Gill and Gladys 
Knight make a class pairing, and Tanya Tucker and Little Richard is a match 
made in camp heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 Less successful are Natalie Cole and Reba McEntire (both too close to the pop 
center to generate much tension), Trisha Yearwood and Aaron Neville 
(warblemania) and Marty Stuart and the Staple Singers (a more than numerical 
mismatch). 
</P>
<P>
 The sleepers? Easily Sam Moore and the late Conway Twitty, who work their way 
deep into the sweet melancholy of "Rainy Night in Georgia" before engaging in 
some loose and warm banter that melts all boundaries and backgrounds into a 
pure distillation of the human spirit.

 Like Woody Allen, Costello has long been beset by fickle fans who prefer "the 
early, funny stuff" -- and has sworn death before nostalgia.So what is he 
doing, breaking his pledge never to reunite the world's greatest backup band, 
the Attractions, readopting the old sound of literate fury, and giving the 
resulting album a title that begs the obvious? Still being true to his own aim, 
and reluctantly indulging our fondest wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't the brilliantly bitter, kid-stuff gynephobia of "This Year's 
Model," although it may sound like it -- thank goodness -- with its crisp 
snares, fat bass riffs and gorgeously spat broadsides. He's still disappointed 
in women, but more disappointed in their users, as in "Sulky Girl," directed 
less at the title pouter than at the unworthy men who've backed her into 
blank-faced defensiveness. Scripting the vagaries of youth -- and of sex, 
alcoholism, co-dependency and even middle-age nostalgia -- brings out a real 
(if really arch) sympathy in Costello he didn't always evidence in his younger 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 That he and the Attractions -- plus part-time bassist Nick Lowe -- play this 
rich, bemusedly mature material with the angry abandon of kids makes the album 
title suddenly non-ironic again. You don't have to have underrated Costello's 
recent work to agree this is his finest album since his last with the 
Attractions, 1986's "Blood and Chocolate."

 Great things have been expected from Trent Reznor ever since his electrifying 
performances on the 1991 "Lollapalooza" tour -- and rock's new prince of 
darkness delivers great things indeed in an album that goes far beyond the 
anger and alienation of most contemporary rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Combining the seductive songwriting craft of Nirvana, the gear-grinding 
industrial howl of Ministry and the raw, unsettling language of William 
Burroughs, Reznor (who is Nine Inch Nails) leads us on a nightmarish journey to 
explore what he sees as an emptiness of the modern spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am the pusher, I am the whore . . . I am the need you have for more," he 
taunts in "Mr. Self Destruct," describing an age in which obsessions and 
addictions have replaced morality and faith as the chief motivational forces. 
But "Spiral" isn't a celebration or acceptance of nihilism and decadence. It 
is, instead, an anguished cry for something to believe in during a time when 
such traditional support systems as religion and family have failed for so 
many. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can have my isolation . . . You can have my absence of faith," Reznor 
declares at one point in the album, reaching out with a hunger so 
uncompromising in its fury and despair that it makes all the headline-grabbing 
horrors of gangsta rap seem suddenly tame. "Spiral" is a major work that is 
likely to stand alongside Nirvana's "Nevermind" as one of the twin towers of 
'90s American rock.

 RAP, ROUND II: As prominent black leaders challenge the racial attitudes of 
companies that exploit "negative African American stereotypes," white 
conservatives have also begun to question the priorities of the Japanese 
conglomerate Sony Corp., which they accuse of "peddling" the pro-marijuana 
music of rap group Cypress Hill to American kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedom Alliance, a Washington-based nonprofit group founded by former 
National Security Council aide and IranContra figure (and current Virginia 
senatorial candidate) Oliver North, attacked Sony in its most recent 
newsletter, demanding that company chiefs Akio Morita and Michael Schulhof 
withdraw sponsorship of Cypress Hill recordings.The Los Angeles rap trio's 
songs include the likes of "I Wanna Get High," and the members serve as 
official spokesmen for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana 
Laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the sake of the children, we think Mr. Morita, who in the past has 
lectured our nation on how to do away with drugs and violence, ought to put an 
end to his company's relationship with these potheads," said Cliff Kincaid, 
director of the 100,000-member organization, which played an instrumental role 
in the 1992 boycott of Time Warner over Ice-T's song "Cop Killer."

 JONES ALONE: Rickie Lee Jones fans got a treat when the singer previewed her 
first-ever solo acoustic tour recently with an informal show at the Troubadour. 
And there was a bonus: Lyle Lovett joined in on harmonies for three songs, 
including an unreleased Jones number.Bassist extraordinaire Rob Wasserman also 
made a guest appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones seemed inspired by the close quarters of the club, joking with audience 
members who were shouting requests between songs, but commanding hushed 
attention during them. With Jones mostly alone at just a piano or acoustic 
guitar, her songs lost the musical complexity of their full-band arrangements, 
but gained in intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to create something of a more secluded environment on stage," Jones 
told Pop Eye. In keeping with that, Jones will stick to small theaters on the 
tour, which starts Tuesday in Berkeley. A Los Angeles date is expected in 
April. Robert Levine

POP EYE: RECORD EXECS TAKING RAP FROM CRITICS CHARGING RACISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Record executives who didn't take last month's congressional gangsta rap 
hearings seriously may be having second thoughts now. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the backdrop of violence that's marred the music's image, record 
companies are scrambling to cope with fallout from the latest accusation 
against rap: racism.  
</P>
<P>
 A growing number of black feminists, church leaders and politicians have 
charged that white-owned record labels are profiting from disseminating 
negative images of African Americans in the music of Snoop Doggy Dogg, Ice Cube 
and other rappers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, record companies involved in rap were accused of racism when they 
succumbed to pressure from white critics and censored or banned potentially 
offensive songs by African American rap artists. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, those applying pressure to the industry include singer 
Dionne Warwick, "Soul Train" founder Don Cornelius and Rev. Calvin Butts, 
pastor of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proliferation of violence and unacceptable sexual messages in our youth's 
music is due in large part to the avarice of the record industry," said C. 
DeLores Tucker, head of the Washington-based National Political Congress of 
Black Women. The organization, which includes such high-profile figures as 
former Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, was instrumental in encouraging Rep. 
Cardiss Collins and Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, both of Illinois, to convene the 
recent rap hearings. A second round of Capitol Hill hearings is planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 400 years, profit has come before principle as African Americans bore the 
brunt of slave masters' degradation," Tucker told Pop Eye. "Who owns the 
companies that put out all this garbage? From what I hear, the record industry 
is demanding in their contracts that these messages of degradation be in the 
music of the artists." 
</P>
<P>
 Record company executives deny that such contracts exist and also call the 
charges of racism absurd. Privately, however, they express concern over the 
groundswell of support that the new wave of gangsta rap critics is gaining in 
the African American community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like the industry just can't win when it comes to putting out 
controversial rap," said one white executive. "You're damned if you do and 
you're damned if you don't." Chuck Philips

RESTAURANT NEWS: BEVERLY HILLS (213) ON THE OUTS WITH VICTOR DRAI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Victor Drai doesn't get bent out of shape very easily. After all, he knows 
that as the owner of Drai's, one of the hottest restaurants in town, and as the 
person who ultimately determines who gets in and who gets snubbed, he's bound 
to make a few enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 A local magazine reported that billionaire Marvin Davis and producer Arnold 
Kopelson were told nothing was available when they called for last-minute 
reservations. Former Spago maitre d' Bernard Erpicum was shown the door for 
annoying Drai's customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some Hollywood people expect to be treated like royalty," says Drai. "I can't 
make some poor schmuck wait for two hours because so-and-so walks into the 
restaurant. Besides, Marvin has come back many times -- he's a real 
sweetheart." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest Drai flap involves the weekly publication Beverly Hills (213). When 
publisher Seth Baker was refused a table, he left a message for Drai to call 
him back. "I saw his message with 20 others and I didn't call him," says Drai. 
"I had no idea who he was." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward, Drai's La Cienega Boulevard restaurant was listed as "out" 
in an "In and Out" column published in Baker's 50,000-circulation weekly. 
"First I heard (Baker) was mad and told his staff never to mention my 
restaurant in the paper again," says Drai. "That didn't bother me. What 
bothered me is when he put me in an 'out' list when I'm busy every night. 
That's mean." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no blacklists or vendettas," says Baker. "Drai's was listed as 
'out' because in the 12 years we've been doing this, I've never had as many 
complaints about a place. He's been rude to an awful lot of people. He's got to 
learn some manners." 
</P>
<P>
 "The paper is read by people I don't care about anyway," says Drai. "I don't 
even know the guy and I did nothing wrong to him."

 GINZA GROWS: Southern California's most expensive restaurant, hidden away in a 
mid-Wilshire strip mall, will close in two weeks. But sushi fans who can't get 
enough ika , kampachi and okara have a new reason to go on living: Ginza 
Sushi-Ko will reopen at its newer, larger quarters on the top floor of Two 
Rodeo in Beverly Hills in May.  
</P>

</P>
<P>
 DOING THE RITE THING: Nick Coe isn't taking any chances that customers might 
not notice an upgrade in quality since he began cooking at Rite Spot in 
Pasadena. The chef, who once cooked at Parkway Grill, has slyly taped up a 
massive paper banner in the window reading, "Now Serving Food."

 PUTTIN' ON THE PRIX-FIXE: You don't have to borrow on your Gold Card to eat 
dinner at the Ritz. The Newport Beach restaurant, known for old-fashioned 
splendor and state-of-the-art prices, now offers a Sunday prix-fixe dinner for 
$24.50. Chef Claude Koeberle's special three-course menu includes soup or 
salad, choice of four entrees such as "prime rib" of pork with cabbage and 
apple sauce, or leg of lamb with root vegetables and fettuccine, and the 
dessert sampler.

 FABRE IN THE USA: Joachim Splichal has invited Jean-Claude Fabre, the chef of

 WINGS: Trattoria Angeli on Santa Monica Boulevard in West L.A., the second -- 
and some say best -- of Evan Kleiman's much-copied Angeli restaurants, will 
close in April. The original Angeli Caffe on Melrose and Angeli Mare in Marina 
del Rey will continue operating. Kleiman closed Angeli in the Rodeo Collection 
-- the fourth of her rustic Italian restaurants -- last year.

AFTER 'MIDNIGHT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "Why Joe Buck and Ratso Live On," by Kenneth Turan (Feb. 20): 
</P>
<P>
 While Turan's commentary on "Midnight Cowboy" was excellent in its study of 
that film's significance to the ratings system, like most recent articles I've 
read on the 25th anniversary of its establishment, it did not accord sufficient 
blame to the ratings board for its perversion of its original intent and 
especially that of the X rating. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-'50s, filmmakers began calling for a classification system that 
would allow them the freedom to deal with "adult" subjects, as their foreign 
counterparts were doing, without worrying about the films being seen by 
children. Objections came from exhibitors, who felt that this would lose them 
the increasingly important teen-age audience. 
</P>
<P>
 During this period, however, creative filmmakers were able to get the 
restrictions of the old Production Code lifted bit by bit, and in 1966, when 
Jack Warner threatened to release "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" without a 
code seal, it was abandoned altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "Midnight Cowboy" was one of many groundbreaking films made during a period 
when there really was no "official" watchdog over the content of American films 
and, as Turan pointed out, it was acclaimed as an example of the kind of 
quality "adult" film the X was supposed to allow. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the film was released at the time of a conservative backlash against 
the "excesses" of the '60s, and the kudos, particularly the Oscar, alarmed the 
obviously conservative ratings board members (liberals don't join censorship 
boards). A look at their ratings in the early '70s strongly suggests a 
deliberate attempt to associate the X rating with sexual excess, furthering the 
association by allowing it to be co-opted by pornographers. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in the first six months of its existence (when "Midnight Cowboy" was 
rated and released) did the Code and Rating Administration come anywhere near 
to living up to the purpose for which it was created -- rating films for 
suitability to audiences of various ages by the mores of the times. Since then, 
its efforts to please the more conservative elements in society have made it a 
continuing source of controversy and its capriciousness the bane of filmmakers 
doing any type of subject. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Those of us who loved "Midnight Cowboy" in its first release saw a whole new 
potential in American movies. But it was made before box-office tallies were 
treated like football scores, before the dictum that movies must be about 
"likable" characters learning tidy lessons in a happy fade-out. It was made 
before the Reagan years almost taught us to hate the underdog that the movie 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Now when the movie reaches its elegiac ending, playing against a melancholy 
harmonica, we feel a sadness not only for Ratso and Joe, but also for a brave 
new world that was promised yet somehow slipped away.

 I thoroughly agree with Turan's comments concerning "Midnight Cowboy." 
However, his statement about the casting of "an Off Broadway actor named Dustin 
Hoffman, who had yet to make 'The Graduate' " was incorrect. "The Graduate" was 
released in 1967, a full two years before "Midnight Cowboy." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 According to producer Jerome Hellman, in 1965, two years before "The 
Graduate," Jack Gelber, a playwright and the first screenwriter of "Midnight 
Cowboy," took him to an Off Broadway production of "a one-man, one-set play 
called 'Eh!' It was Dustin, a broom and a boiler, and he was stunning. I 
contacted his agent the next morning, and we began our dialogue." "Midnight 
Cowboy" went through so many drafts, however, that "The Graduate" proved to be 
Hoffman's first screen project.

PORTRAIT OF THE ARTISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was very much pleased with Christopher Knight's article "Two Murals, Two 
Histories" (Feb. 20). Knight deals with an aspect of these murals in the 
context of their times and socio-political-economic (did I leave out anything?) 
realities, which no one else (to my knowledge) has attempted. 
</P>
<P>
 This is especially interesting to me since I worked as a "gofer" for Dean 
Cornwell on the Central Library murals from June, 1931, to March, 1933, at age 
19 to 21. 
</P>
<P>
 An interesting sidelight to Knight's story is the fact that Cornwell spent a 
number of evenings in the Olvera Street class to learn the fresco technique. He 
painted two heads on brick newel posts at the top of a wooden stairway outside 
the adjacent building. I don't recall his saying anything about David Alfaro 
Siqueiros or even meeting him. However, some details escape me after 61 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight's comments about the library murals are much kinder than those of the 
critics at the time of their completion. As he points out, the Cornwell murals 
were conceived and commissioned by the Establishment at the height of the real 
estate-stock market euphoria, and completed after the stock market crash of 
October, 1929. 
</P>
<P>
 I cannot speak too warmly about Cornwell's kindness to me, as he encouraged me 
to persevere in pursuing a career in illustration. 
</P>
<P>
 JOHN P. SPENCER 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena 
</P>
<P>
 Getty Conservation Institute consultant Luis Garza, who is coordinating the 
conservation program for the Siqueiros mural, says that a review of documents 
prompted by Knight's article shows that Cornwell was in fact among several 
artists whom Siqueiros taught the fresco technique while working on the Olvera 
Street mural.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I was thrilled to read Knight's article about my uncle David Alfaro Siqueiros. 
He was sure of the statement and power in the mural and at the same time 
enjoyed, in retrospect, the irony and humor the incident created early in his 
career as a muralist. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during his stay in Los Angeles that David became very involved with 
Angelica Arenal (his future wife) and Luis Arenal, my father, also a painter, 
who went on to work with David on many of his murals. 
</P>
<P>
 The power of David's art and personality has yet to be felt in this country, 
but this is a beginning, and he would have been delighted to know that his work 
is finally going to be seen here. 
</P>
<P>
 This was not David's only work in L.A. There is another mural, in the house 
once owned by director Dudley Murphy in Pacific Palisades. It is still there.

BIOSPHERE 2 CREW TO BEGIN A 98-YEAR LIVE-IN SHUTTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Biosphere 2 embarks today on what its operators hope will be the start of 98 
years of continuous habitation in the domed ecological laboratory 
</P>
<P>
 and the recovery of its image as serious science. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly six months after the first eight-member crew ended a two-year stay 
inside the lab, the project has been redesigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a crew of five men and two women will rotate in and out of the three-acre 
glass-and-steel bubble and its 10 apartments. The private, for-profit project 
is supposed to run like a remote research station. 
</P>
<P>
 Space Biospheres Ventures, based here 35 miles northeast of Tucson, operates 
the $150-million experiment paid for largely by Texas billionaire Edward Bass. 
</P>
<P>
 It was designed to last 100 years as a self-sustaining laboratory replicating 
Earth's environment with a rain forest, ocean, savannah, 
desert-turned-chaparral, marsh and farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Before, the chief goals were developing technology for an Earth-like 
environment in space and finding ways to solve Earth's ecological problems. 
Now, technology for Earth is primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Norberto Alvarez-Romo, the company's vice president in charge of mission 
control, compared the first two years to "a shakedown cruise away from a port." 
</P>
<P>
 He'll be in Biosphere 2 for four months working on paperless communication 
systems, joining six others who will stay for various shifts of 10 months to 
more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 When Alvarez-Romo leaves, he'll be replaced by independent scientists working 
on other projects for up to two months. Later others, including teachers, will 
be allowed in for short stays. 
</P>
<P>
 After the project began Sept. 26, 1991, Biosphere 2 lost credibility with the 
public and the scientific community because of various mishaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Claims about its self-sufficiency were deflated as crops failed and food and 
oxygen were brought in to sustain the crew. 
</P>
<P>
 One crew member went out for finger surgery, and prominent scientists on its 
advisory panel quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the first crew left Sept. 26, several mechanical systems have been 
improved. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, high-pressure sodium lamps were installed over the farm to 
boost winter crop yield and 40 geckos and 50 toads were brought in to eat the 
cockroaches.

WHEN HATEMONGERS CAME FOR MINORITIES, TOWN SAID NO; MONTANA: BILLINGS COUNTERED 
HARASSMENT OF JEWS BY PUTTING MENORAHS ALL OVER TOWN. WHEN THE HOME OF A 
MIXED-RACE COUPLE WAS VANDALIZED, THE PAINTERS UNION REPAIRED THE DAMAGE. THE 
EFFORT APPEARS TO HAVE COWED THE RACISTS -- AT LEAST FOR NOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police Chief Wayne Inman has seen what happens when racism and anti-Semitism 
are allowed to fester. As a cop in Oregon, he watched skinhead hatred turn 
murderous. 
</P>
<P>
 When the swastikas appeared in Billings, Montana's largest city, Inman was 
determined to halt the hatred early. He and others stirred the community to a 
roar of outrage that appears to have cowed the racist groups, at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hate crimes are not a police problem; they're a community problem," he said 
in an interview. "Hate crimes and hate activity will flourish only in 
communities that allow it to flourish." 
</P>
<P>
 The first signs came last year, when fliers started showing up in Billings 
mailboxes, on doorsteps, under windshield wipers. The fliers and anonymous 
phone calls vilified Hispanics, Native Americans, blacks, gays, lesbians and 
welfare recipients, but reserved special venom for the city's Jewish community 
of 48 families. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, a series of seemingly random, isolated incidents: 
</P>
<P>
 * In January, a few skinheads slipped into a Martin Luther King Day 
observance; afterward, participants found their cars papered with Ku Klux Klan 
material. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the spring, skinheads began showing up in twos and threes at Wayman 
Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church, glowering in the back pews. As the 
Rev. Bob Freeman recalls it, "They were trying to intimidate us with 'the 
stare,' you know." 
</P>
<P>
 * In August, a black swastika painted on white poster board was nailed to the 
door of Beth Aaron Synagogue, and tombstones were toppled in its cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 * In October, swastikas and racial slurs were spray-painted on the home of a 
mixed-race couple -- white and Native American. 
</P>
<P>
 From his previous job, Inman recognized an emerging pattern -- hate literature 
to intimidation to vandalism to personal attacks -- which in Portland had 
culminated in the 1988 beating death of Mulugeta Seraw, a young Ethiopian. 
Seraw's three skinhead attackers were fresh from a meeting of East Side White 
Pride at which two agents of White Aryan Resistance, a supremacist group, gave 
a spirited "recruitment" speech. 
</P>
<P>
 The skinheads pleaded guilty, and, in a trial two years later, White Aryan 
Resistance founder Tom Metzger and his son, John, were convicted of inciting 
Seraw's murder by recruitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the emergence of the hate groups and a community's denial, and I saw a 
wake-up call that was the death of a black man . . . by baseball bat because he 
was black," Inman said. "That's what it took to wake up Portland. We didn't 
have to go through that here to get the wake-up call." 
</P>
<P>
 What was different in Billings, a metropolitan area of about 100,000 people, 
was the united public reaction to the early ugliness. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was not silence," Inman said. "There was community outrage, saying, 'If 
you harass and intimidate one member of this community, you are attacking all 
of us.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Inman kept repeating a message to civic groups and community leaders: Hate 
groups must be resisted, not ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 The resistance was more than bluster. Within five days of the spray-painted 
vandalism, 27 volunteers from Painters Local 1922 swarmed over the defaced 
house and obliterated the slurs in 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bigotry resurfaced the next month. On Nov. 27, a beer bottle was hurled 
through a glass door at the home of Uri Barnea, conductor of the Billings 
Symphony. Five nights later, a cinder block thrown through a window sent shards 
of glass spraying over the bed of 5-year-old Isaac Schnitzer. 
</P>
<P>
 Both houses were decorated with Hanukkah menorahs. Both houses had children at 
home with baby sitters. 
</P>
<P>
 The threats to children aroused a fierceness in the city. Christian churches 
distributed photocopies of menorahs. The Billings Gazette published a 
black-and-white picture of a menorah with an editorial, then a full-page 
version in color. Several businesses began providing paper menorahs. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days, the nine-candled symbol of Jewish perseverance and resistance 
from the second century B.C. was displayed in thousands of windows across the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 The menorah idea started with the Rev. Keith Torney of the First 
Congregational Church and Margie MacDonald of the Montana Assn. of Churches. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was just getting to be too much," Torney said. "At first, the homosexual 
community was being harassed. First the gays, then the black community, but it 
seemed to me they kind of hit their stride in the Jewish community. It's like 
they're searching around to get attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Civic leaders, churches and businesses declared their revulsion. Universal 
Athletics replaced its billboard display on a busy thoroughfare with this 
message: 
</P>
<P>
 "NOT IN OUR TOWN! NO HATE. NO VIOLENCE." 
</P>
<P>
 But the hatemongers returned. Over two weeks in December, they broke windows 
at two Jewish homes and two churches that displayed menorahs, shot bullets 
through windows at Billings Central Catholic High School, and stomped and 
battered six vehicles at homes displaying menorahs, telling two owners in phone 
calls, "Go look at your car, Jew-lover." 
</P>
<P>
 The spasm of hate only created more resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The result was that many more people put menorahs in their windows," Inman 
said, allowing himself a rare grin at the memory. "It became physically 
impossible for the hate groups to harass and intimidate thousands and thousands 
of Billings citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 10, about 100 people attended a Hanukkah service at Beth Aaron 
Synagogue. Outside, other neighbors discreetly stood vigil in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is not proclaiming victory, but Inman thinks the hate groups have 
backed off. No vandalism has occurred since the incidents in December, and the 
literature and anonymous calls have diminished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hate to predict we have stopped the influence and impact of hate 
crimes, but something appears to be working," Inman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A grimmer outlook comes from Clinton Sipes, a former skinhead who did time for 
assault, armed robbery and burglary, and now runs a program to help youngsters 
leave racist groups. He thinks the gains are temporary, the solutions not 
nearly so simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "A year from now," Sipes predicts, "we're going to have racial assaults, 
vandalism, all kinds of violence."

MONEY, POLITICS AND THE FUTURE OF EL TORO BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In reference to your article, "Lincoln Club Seeks El Toro Airport Ballot 
Initiative," March 1), 'I think your reporter did a masterful job of reporting 
the attitude and clout of this organization. 
</P>
<P>
 These people come across to me as a group who will do anything to push their 
agenda for an airport at El Toro regardless of who they hurt or impoverish in 
the process. This ballot measure is simply a smoke screen, and if it fails will 
probably be replaced by some other legal shenanigans. 
</P>
<P>
 They could accomplish their profit motive more humanely by backing Larry 
Agran's great idea for the conversion as outlined in his recent article in The 
Times. They could still profit and create many more jobs than an airport could 
provide and at the same time allow the people in South County to live a 
peaceful life and protect the tremendous investment in their homes and 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 I appeal to the Lincoln Club to use their political power to enhance the 
quality of life of the people of South County and thereby benefit the whole 
county as well.

 * I have tried to not get upset every time I read a story about the future of 
El Toro, but the latest ballot initiative (plan) is all I can take. After the 
initial uproar over the airport issue, our local cities were assured that all 
options would be considered, but now we are having the airport forced upon us 
again. If this issue becomes a ballot measure, the cities closest to the 
airport will never have enough votes or money to compete with the "pro-airport" 
cities. Orange County's main population will vote for an airport that does not 
interfere with their quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the northern Orange County cities feel so interested in El Toro, I think 
a ballot initiative should be considered for Bolsa Chica. 
</P>
<P>
 It will also have an effect on the future economic state of Orange County. If 
we are not allowed local control, why should Huntington Beach? Maybe we should 
study the Disneyland expansion proposals as well as resurrect the Gypsum jail 
issue in Anaheim Hills. I have always believed the people affected most by any 
change should have the majority rights on property use, not the ones with the 
most money. But if we can have an airport forced on us, maybe we should rethink 
other issues around the county.

BOLSA CHICA PROJECT SEEN AS BOON AND EXAMPLE OF FLAWED PLANNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Huntington Beach City Councilman Dave Sullivan's article (Feb. 13) would 
have one believe that Huntington Beach will be responsible for providing all of 
the public services to the unincorporated Bolsa Chica area, without the benefit 
of receiving compensatory tax revenues, and claims the Koll Real Estate Group 
will renege on its commitment to restore the wetlands. The Orange County 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry believes his assertions are terribly 
misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the county will be the agency with the responsibility for providing 
most of the basic public services to the Bolsa Chica project, including police 
and fire. The landowner is paying for a new, fully equipped fire station as 
well as additional sheriff personnel to patrol the area. Sewer services can be 
provided through the Orange County Sanitation District. If the city does not 
wish to furnish water services to the area, the landowner can follow any one of 
several options to ensure that water is provided, and will fund all necessary 
improvements to the system and connection fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the city will benefit tremendously from the Bolsa Chica project in 
terms of public improvements and sales tax revenues. The project will stimulate 
economic growth in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 An economic study recently completed by Kenneth Leventhal and Associates 
concludes that the city will be the primary beneficiary of the 17,000 jobs 
created during construction and 6,000 post-construction jobs created by the 
project. This is the economic equivalent of having another large employer like 
McDonnell Douglas move into the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Chamber of Commerce and Industry is taking a leadership role 
in retaining and attracting business and jobs to Orange County. We strongly 
support a project such as Bolsa Chica because it balances job creation with 
environmental improvement. Further, the landowner guarantees it will deed 1,100 
acres of restored wetlands and open space to public ownership for our community 
to enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 We can't afford to pass up this offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Our fear is that political posturing will further delay the Bolsa Chica 
project and the much needed economic boost it will provide. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than creating political obstacles, our elected officials should work 
with the business community to focus on the project's benefits to the city of 
Huntington Beach, the residents of Orange County and our future generations, 
and work to get the project approved. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Chairman of the Board 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Chamber of Commerce 
</P>
<P>
 and Industry 
</P>
<P>
 * I found it interesting that County Planning Director Tom Mathews (Letters, 
Feb. 27) never considered the most fundamental question, which is, should there 
be any development on the Bolsa Chica in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
 We are several months into the process, there has yet to be a county public 
hearing, and we are looking at a potential grand jury investigation for 
archeology. 
</P>
<P>
 The "planning process" is seriously flawed. Unfortunately for Mr. Mathews, his 
department is caught in the political vice of planning how to get the proposed 
project approved instead of working with the community to plan the project in 
the first place.

TAKING A HINT FROM WISE YOUNG HEADS; * IF THREE JUNIOR HIGH STUDENTS CAN DESIGN 
A CITY THAT WORKS, WHY CAN'T WE ADULTS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To realize the potential of the future, it is necessary first to envision it. 
Southern California, for one, has been built that way, by dreamers who 
understood that if you imagine it, maybe they will come. 
</P>
<P>
 After fire, earthquake and flood, the region is again poised at a crossroads, 
summoned by events and by its moment not only to affirm its future, but maybe 
even to reinvent some of it. And who better to engage in that kind of 
brainstorming, not only for this region but for the country at large, than 
today's youngsters, the very people who will be there when tomorrow arrives? 
</P>
<P>
 Three eighth-graders from Bernardo Yorba Junior High School in Yorba Linda -- 
Jacob Smith, Cory Jobst and Jeff Carroll, tackled a challenge posed by the 
National Engineers Week Future City Contest to propose an ideal city for the 
year 2195. Their effort, an 18-foot-square model of a city called Ancona, was 
selected over offerings by six other teams as the winner in the Future City 
Contest. It was created by using a computer game called "Sim City," and then 
the boys created the model they showed the judges from their computer work. The 
model featured a working train system. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngsters not only proposed a city's infrastructure, they addressed its 
soul as well. In an essay prepared for earlier regional competition, they 
talked about ways in which different cultures could live in harmony in their 
futuristic city. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros offered a welcome word 
of support for these efforts, encouraging the youngsters to further their 
education and use whatever engineering expertise they might develop for the 
future of their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 They deserve such plaudits for tapping the vigor and optimism of their youth, 
and applying their minds and hearts, to challenges of the future that are so 
daunting to so many of their elders.

LEAVE GOD IN SCOUTING, AND GODLESS OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Scouting is not a business but a fraternal organization. It is a way of life 
-- locally, statewide, nationally and internationally.  
</P>
<P>
 Take God out of Scouting, you take the heart, soul and the spirit away.God 
belongs in Scouting, as those who do not believe in God belong out of Scouting. 
</P>
<P>
 The beauty of the U.S. is its diversity. The challenge is to the Randall 
family to start their own atheist boys organization. No one is forcing them to 
associate with God-loving people, as no one would stand in their way to 
associate with godless-believing people. 
</P>
<P>
 I only feel sorry that they try to damage children's organizations with their 
minority views and the litigation costs of defense that burden (Boy Scouts of 
America and Girl Scouts of America.) 
</P>
<P>
 Don't forget that it is the attorney Randall who is attacking the Boy Scouts 
and Girl Scouts, not the reverse. The Times calls for a drop in litigation by 
(the Boy Scouts) ("Business of Scouting," Editorial, March 2), not to defend 
their values that are being attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times is wrong. It is the Randalls who should drop their attack on (the 
Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts), gather all of the atheists, form their own 
organization, and go their own way, and take The Times with them.

HOPEFUL COVERAGE OF A VIOLENT SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * We would like to commend you for Greg Hernandez's reporting and Mark 
Boster's photography in the story "Building Bridges -- and Trust," (Feb. 22). 
</P>
<P>
 These men brought sensitivity and hope to their reporting of our neighborhood 
reality and a genuine concern for our "at-risk" youth.We appreciate The Times' 
concern in imagining creative approaches to empower people in violent 
situations to realize their capacity for goodness. There are possibilities for 
change when young people can envision alternatives for their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The article accentuated the presence of us three priests on the street and our 
involvement in the lives of our friends. We and the very many unsung folk from 
the neighborhoods of Orange County who collaborate with us in the streets and 
in the meetings have received more than we have given, have truly been enriched 
by the young people who have allowed us to enter their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang involvement is a very complex reality in our communities, and we have 
witnessed the new life which emerges when people speak with and touch each 
other in what becomes a mutual learning and conversion.  
</P>
<P>
 We invite the residents of Orange County to a new way of relationship -- to 
see and encounter gang-involved kids, the youth of Santa Ana and other inner 
cities as real people with the same fears, wounds, hopes and possibilities as 
everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Might your readers, and other sisters and brothers in the various 
neighborhoods of Orange County continue the attempt to come to know the names 
of their neighbors and their pain and dreams? Might we imagine confronting 
seemingly difficult kids with confidence and hope and begin to risk sharing our 
dreams with them? Might we at least continue to wonder and question and 
dialogue together?

SHOW LEADERSHIP ON EL TORO'S CONVERSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 HEAD* Supervisors Should Stick With Planning Panel; Ballot Initiative Is the 
Easy Way OutThere is clearly nothing wrong with elected officials listening to 
the people they represent; that is what they should do. But after soliciting 
opinions, it is still the officeholders who must make the final decision. 
Passing the buck, or holding a moist finger aloft to see which way the 
political winds blow before taking a stand on issues, is an abdication of 
leadership and government's role. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of what to do with the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station when the 
military leaves by 1999 has polarized county residents and politicians for 
nearly a year. But after several fits and starts, an agreement was finally 
reached to create a committee to suggest to the Defense Department how the base 
will be used after it comes under civilian control. That committee of elected 
officials, the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, must be allowed to do its work 
of gathering information and listening to opinions. It should not be 
short-circuited by a ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Last August, UC Irvine Prof. Mark P. Petracca urged the Board of Supervisors 
to put an initiative on the ballot so voters could rank their preferences for 
the future of El Toro. Petracca is a prominent county Democrat, and his 
suggestion to the five Republican supervisors sank like a stone. Now comes the 
Lincoln Club, an organization of conservative Republicans with enormous clout 
in the county, also urging a ballot initiative on El Toro. And when the Lincoln 
Club speaks, supervisors listen. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors had long opposed a ballot initiative on the grounds that one 
of their key jobs is land-use planning, which is correct. But when three 
leaders of the Lincoln Club, two of whom are developers, spoke with supervisors 
about the initiative, attitudes changed. Now the supervisors are considering 
putting the issue on the ballot; Lincoln Club leaders have warned that they may 
sponsor a November initiative themselves if the supervisors do not. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not at all clear what the initiative would say, and given the slow pace 
so far, it seems unlikely there will be enough time by November to explore and 
present the wide range of possible uses for El Toro. An advisory initiative at 
some point might be helpful, but it is premature now. It could wind up as a 
thumbs up or down on a commercial airport. The public already has a voice 
through advisory committees in each city that will relay opinions to the reuse 
authority. Let that authority do its job before sponsoring any ballot 
initiative. Governing is not a popularity contest. Sometimes tough choices have 
to be made.

TWO VIEWS ON SEX ABSTINENCE WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Abstinence week? Puleez! Costa Mesa Mayor Sandra L. Genis' declaration is 
not anti-gay. It is anti-reality and anti-compassion, and about as aware as 
Marie Antoinette's declaration, "Let them eat cake," in response to the 
starving French peasants who had no bread. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor of Costa Mesa appears to be on a roll, missing the boat yet again 
with her flagrant misapprehension of the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 Attacking the red ribbon, which symbolizes awareness of this health crisis and 
solidarity with those suffering from AIDS, and washing out the "blood" by 
substituting a white ribbon is a perfect example of how many of our so-called 
leaders have put their heads in the sand and allowed the death toll to mount 
unabated. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Genis, if you don't know how to respond to this overwhelming world 
crisis, just say so. Ignorance is not a crime, but acting out of ignorance, 
especially in public office, can have disastrous consequences. There are 
several AIDS services organizations in Orange County that would provide you 
with valuable information, or you could attend the seventh annual "HIV/AIDS on 
the Front Line Conference" to be held this month in your fair city. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope you will not choose to abstain from information yourself. 
</P>

 * I write in response to your article ("Abstinence Statement Criticized as 
Anti-Gay," March 2) reporting Costa Mesa City Council's declaration of 
Abstinence Week. I, too, support the belief that sexual activity be delayed 
until marriage.  
</P>
<P>
 The only "safe sex" is within the confines of a monogamous relationship. I 
applaud Mayor Genis and her City Council's willingness to stand on the truth.

THE CABLE TV INDUSTRY'S MONOPOLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I refer to yet another article on the cable TV industry ("Wireless Cable 
Venture in O.C. Could Cut Bills," Feb. 25): When are we going to get them to 
lower their prices? We seem to get the same old reaction from them. They have 
to study the rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 They do not study the rulings. They defy them. They do not appear to have a 
strong lobby, yet they do not comply with the FCC rulings about their 
exorbitant prices. They must know somebody. Surely their financial statements 
are the ultimate proof of their gouging the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Paragon Cable, the priciest of them all serving the Fountain Valley area, 
didn't hesitate in responding to the weakness of the ruling. They eliminated 
the senior citizens discount. I complained, of course, but it didn't do any 
good. I have cable primarily to see the hockey games. Prime Ticket is very 
good. The much ballyhooed ESPN is great for basketball, not hockey. Yet their 
new affiliate, ESPN 2, has several games per week, but we here in Fountain 
Valley don't get this station. 
</P>
<P>
 In inquiring why not, we get the same old answer: Costs are prohibitive, or 
they don't have room for the station. 
</P>
<P>
 In adjacent Santa Ana, another company (Comcast) with far (lower) rates 
provides this service. I don't get it. Of course the ultimate blame rests on 
the shoulders of the individual cities that simply handed the cable companies 
reins to conduct their monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's hoping that the FCC gets its teeth sharpened.

ELEVATED TOLLWAY LOAN SETS NEW LOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Absolutely amazing! Just when you think that government waste can't get any 
worse, we find a local example that sets a new standard. Our own Orange County 
Transportation Agency is going to cut services to youth groups and the elderly 
but simultaneously give $12.5 million to private companies, including (one led 
by billionaire Ross Perot's son). 
</P>
<P>
 These poor, needy companies are asking for help because private investors are 
not stupid enough to put up money for design work and an environmental impact 
report on their pet project -- an elevated tollway that would run down the 
middle of the most important flood control channel in Orange County, through 
alluvial soils subject to liquefaction, only a few miles from the epicenter of 
the devastating 1933 Long Beach earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching the devastation of collapsed freeways in Southern California 
and floods in the Midwest, would you risk your money on the chance of combining 
the two by building an elevated tollway above the Santa Ana River? If you like 
this kind of opportunity, maybe we can interest you in a building on the Cal 
State Northridge campus that was just reinforced to meet the latest standards 
of design for seismic safety. Luckily, the county staff is preparing a "due 
diligence" report to make sure that this is a sound use of taxpayer money, even 
though this sham loan will probably never be repaid. 
</P>
<P>
 I suggest that the county staff answer one question as part of their report: 
When this tollway collapses, and half of Orange County is destroyed by the 
ensuing flood damage, can the district attorney ask for the death penalty for 
the planners and the OCTA board for premeditated murder?

POTSHOTS AT THE RESALE OF GUNS CONFISCATED BY POLICE AGENCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Police departments selling guns for profit ("O.C. Police Take Heat for 
Selling Seized Guns," Feb. 25) is not only the ultimate in rationalization, 
it's the ultimate insult to law-abiding citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 While the citizenry is coming up with creative, albeit desperate, ways to 
remove guns from the streets, the Orange and Huntington Beach police 
departments sell them for eventual redistribution back to where they came. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was one last chance/hope we had on the street-gun issue, it should 
have been the leaders of the brave men and women who have to wear a bulletproof 
vest under their clothes just to go to work! It's a new level of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, I liked it better when you could find a cop at a doughnut shop 
instead of making deals for profit with private arms dealers. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * Oh, it does my heart good to read that Southern California's elected 
officials and city managers are so up to doing their duty as those in Northern 
California. Let's take a look at what yours have recently accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 According to "O.C. Police Take Heat for Selling Seized Guns," they are 
managing to step in and attempt to halt our law enforcement agencies from 
raising badly needed budget funds to combat crime! Boy, they will just do 
anything to interfere with law enforcement's ability to protect us private 
citizens! 
</P>
<P>
 No matter that they have now created enough pressure to force a legitimate 
businessman to close his doors. A businessman who has legally assisted these 
agencies in returning over $10 million to the public coffers to help combat 
crime! 
</P>
<P>
 And that doesn't count the sales tax and state registration fees collected 
when this product is legitimately resold through licensed channels to a 
law-abiding consumer! They should be so proud of themselves! 
</P>
<P>
 And, these are the same people who will be coming to you and me for more taxes 
because they can find tax money to earmark for combatting crime.  
</P>
<P>
 A special note to Santa Ana Councilman Ted R. Moreno. You had better also stop 
your (city's) practice of selling confiscated vehicles from drug dealers. If 
you look at recent studies published in this very same paper, your kids have a 
much better chance of being run over by one of those vehicles. And those 
confiscated and recovered bicycles: Why, your child has an extremely good 
chance of being injured by one of those terrible evil products. 
</P>
<P>
 A simple question. Have any of you ever read the 1968 United States Gun 
Control Act? When will this lunacy end? When will my intelligence ever be safe 
from insult by these people and your newspaper? 
</P>
<P>
 KIP CANFIELD 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Who are the people turning in guns at the Anaheim Pond, Aamco transmission 
or any other guns for goodies exchanges? By all accounts, gangbangers and 
crooks are not filling the lines. 
</P>
<P>
 It is ironic that at the same time that these guns for goodies programs are 
going on nationwide, there are law enforcement agencies selling confiscated 
firearms that were in fact taken from -- you guessed it -- gangbangers and 
crooks!  
</P>
<P>
 Politicians defend this policy as a fiscal necessity and a legal practice. 
Some law enforcement officials say: "It is not like you are adding to the 
supply by selling confiscated weapons." This is political hypocrisy and ignores 
ethical as well as moral issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it ethical to defend this practice as legal while at the same time seeking 
to outlaw currently legal sales of other types of weapons? Is it moral to 
ignore the fact that a police officer has already risked his or her life once 
to take these guns off our streets? 
</P>
<P>
 This policy of selling cheap, secondhand guns by cities and law enforcement 
agencies must be halted immediately. Weapons stockpiled should not be sold. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time to shed some light in this hypocritical practice and demand that 
all cities and law enforcement agencies nationwide get out of the business of 
adding to the supply of guns on our streets.

 * I note, with less than a sense of community pride, that Orange County ranks 
very low on the generosity scale. According to the United Way, we are only 
one-fourth as giving as Seattle (King County), even though God has gifted us 
with much better weather, not to mention great financial opportunities. The 
Orange County "fat cats" and we lesser cats, if not motivated by the warm 
feeling of generosity, should at least be activated by the cold sense of guilt.

SCHOOL UNIFORMS CHANGE BEHAVIOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to her letter regarding school uniforms (Letters to The Times, 
Feb. 27), Ms. (Lynn) Harkins completely misses the point. 
</P>
<P>
 Our societal breakdown is caused by many factors: poverty, hopelessness, lack 
of family, failure controlling our children and the direction they are heading. 
</P>
<P>
 Dress changes behavior. If children are dressed in school attire, they will 
think of themselves as students. 
</P>
<P>
 As a former teacher I speak from experience that it wastes a teacher's time to 
discern whether a pupil is dressed according to code, refer that student to the 
principal, and then (wastes) the principal's time to correct the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual self-expression can be exercised in school through art, creative 
writing, music, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Self-expression in clothes is appropriate after school, on weekends and 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 School uniform banks can be started to recycle outgrown outfits. Uniforms are 
a good first step in the right direction to regaining control of our children 
and schools.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS; WHAT IF THE BIG ONE 
HIT, AND WE WERE ACTUALLY READY FOR IT?; LOSS TO LIFE AND LIMB WILL BE GREAT NO 
MATTER WHAT, BUT JUST IMAGINE THE DIFFERENCE THOUGHTFUL PLANNING COULD MAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BADE, Dr. Robert Bade is assistant clinical professor of emergency 
medicine, UC Irvine, and chairman of MDR Inc., a nonprofit public benefit 
corporation. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Picture this chilling scenario in earthquake-vulnerable Orange County. It 
could happen. It's 1996, and the major Newport-Inglewood earthquake earlier 
this year left massive death and destruction along a 35-mile corridor 
stretching from Huntington Beach through Fountain Valley and Santa Ana, and 
well into Laguna Hills and Coto de Caza. 
</P>
<P>
 It killed 20,000 men, women and children. Most died instantly, but many were 
lost because they couldn't be dug out in time. Over 500,000 were injured, 
100,000 suffering severe life- and limb-threatening conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The death and disability toll among the severely injured would have been much 
higher, more than doubled, but many thousands received on-the-spot advanced 
emergency medical care from hundreds of medical volunteers who were prepared to 
act without delay. The story of one victim, 14-year-old Anna, illustrates the 
events of that terrible disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Anna was in class at the local high school when it hit. She was on the third 
floor when the building partially collapsed and heavy desks, file cabinets and 
debris were hurled cruelly about, killing or severely injuring 512 students and 
staff. The coroner later reported that all 150 deaths were virtually 
instantaneous due to massive head and chest injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Anna and 361 others were badly hurt, mostly with crushed legs, concussions, 
major fractures and lacerations with severe blood loss. Anna's right foot was 
mutilated by falling concrete.  
</P>
<P>
 As soon as the first quake stopped, most of the 2,000 uninjured students and 
faculty evacuate the ruined building. All of the staff and a group of seniors 
had been trained in first aid and the "simple triage and rapid treatment" 
technique. They deployed through the rubble finding victims and safely moving 
many of them to open ground. They knew the threat of aftershocks and worked 
swiftly and quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone knew "the Big One" had hit and that they would be on their own for 
the next few days. Within the first hour, concerned parents began arriving and 
were organized and put to work. Six nurses and two physicians were already at 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Gray left her car and walked to the site from the smashed freeway two 
miles away, having identified the school as a pre-defined medical supply site 
from a special map issued to volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 She had a backpack of supplies she kept in the car trunk since becoming a 
volunteer and treated the most severely wounded while rescue and sorting 
continued. Her backpack supplies lasted for about an hour, but with them she 
was able to relieve a collapsed lung, surgically open a victim's windpipe, 
intubate the lungs of three unconscious concussion victims, and begin 
intravenous diuresis and antibiotics on two victims with crushed legs -- one of 
whom was Anna. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong non-narcotic pain shots were administered to the most needy. The 
medical volunteers organized a disaster medical aid center and sent volunteers 
to bring them the area's Medical Disaster Response supply modules. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next several hours more medical volunteers arrived, several from the 
local medical clinic bringing additional supply modules to supplement those 
stored at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional victims were brought in from the surrounding neighborhood. The 
National Guard responded to prearranged landing zone signals on the soccer 
field, leaving an armed trooper on site to communicate with the growing numbers 
of available medevac helicopters. Several students were flown out to San Diego 
and Riverside hospitals for surgical treatment of severe internal injuries. 
They arrived in good condition thanks to stabilization at the Aid Center and 
will do well. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next 12 to 24 hours, the flow of victims slowed considerably, but the 
victims, laid side by side, covered the entire football field. 
</P>
<P>
 At night, a group of 13 physicians and 68 nurses labored under generator 
lights to surgically clean wounds, relieve pain and keep the severely injured 
stable. It is grim work in a battlefield setting but it paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 Over 400 men, women and children were stabilized for orderly evacuation 
outside the quake zone. Anna was resting pain-free in a camping tent after 
surgical cleansing of her wounds and powerful antibiotic treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the initial jolt there is a sense of calm at the aid center. 
More medical volunteers arrived from nearby undamaged communities, bringing 
their supply modules with them. Very few new victims arrived. The casualties 
are kept comfortable and are continuously re-evaluated, much like a hospital 
intensive care unit but without the electronics. When evacuation opportunities 
arise, the most needy go out first. Anna is comfortable and her mother is with 
her. The foot looks bad, however, and is showing signs of gangrene. 
</P>
<P>
 On Day 3, it's business as usual. Food, shelter and security are under 
control. The hospitals within helicopter range are saturated and only a few 
roads are open so evacuation is slow. 
</P>
<P>
 Anna's lower leg has to be amputated to prevent the spread of gangrene. The 
surgery is performed with anesthesia and without pain. The loss of her leg is 
tragic, but she survives without further disability. 
</P>
<P>
 By Day 7 all critically injured have been evacuated and the disaster medical 
aid center is now a tent city. 
</P>
<P>
 Epilogue: Anna's leg had healed and she has adjusted to her artificial leg. 
Her classmates have all been helped with stress debriefing therapy by volunteer 
mental health workers. They get together every year for the rest of their long 
lives to commemorate the tragedy that could have been much worse. It is 
estimated that an additional 30,000 people would have died if the medical 
response had not been available. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for a scenario. The fact is that vital emergency medical care is not 
currently available through any of the existing county, Red Cross, Salvation 
Army, state or federal relief programs. Injuries like Anna's will be fatal if 
the great quake strikes before a medical disaster response program can be 
implemented. She would likely develop blood poisoning and kidney failure within 
a few days. By the time relief arrives she would be dead or, at best, the 
ruined leg would be amputated and she would survive on renal dialysis for the 
rest of her shortened, chronically-ill life. 
</P>
<P>
 At this moment in real time, there exists a nonprofit volunteer group named 
Medical Disaster Response. More than 400 physicians and nurses and medical 
technicians have been trained over the past five years to respond in major 
disasters. But they can do little without supplies. To be truly effective, 
their supplies must be pre-packed and prepositioned and rotated regularly to 
ensure freshness. 
</P>
<P>
 The first MDR supply modules are already in place in Mission Viejo (there are 
three in that city), Disneyland, the Bristol Park Medical Building in Irvine, 
and Our Lady of Fatima Elementary School in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty backpacks have been distributed to specially trained physicians ready to 
be filled with life- and limb-saving supplies. Large-scale participation is in 
the works for the UC Irvine Medical School campus and a prominent medical 
group's 10 facilities throughout the county. But we need at least 100 more 
supply modules and backpacks distributed around the county before we can expect 
to accomplish the recoveries in the scenario described above.

 Our "Annas" deserve a fighting chance against preventable disability and

A MONITORING SYSTEM IS NEEDED FOR HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In his Feb. 21 letter responding to Roselle Lewis' health maintenance 
organization horror story, Edward H. Moss incorrectly states that under the 
Clinton health-care plan, everyone in the United States would be subject to 
only managed care. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton plan, as introduced in the House of Representatives in December, 
specifically requires regional health alliances to offer at least one 
traditional fee-for-service plan. 
</P>
<P>
 As an individual with multiple sclerosis and as the government issues 
coordinator for the California Chapters of the National Multiple Sclerosis 
Society, I certainly share both Lewis' and Moss' concern about managed care. In 
fact, I have written a nationally distributed paper about the dangers that 
managed care -- as currently practiced -- poses for people with disabilities 
and chronic illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 However, with or without the Clinton plan, the fact is that managed care is 
taking over more and more of our health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 This situation makes it clear that we need effective mechanisms in place to 
monitor quality and protect consumers against inappropriate denial of service. 
In that regard, the Clinton plan represents a significant improvement over what 
we have now. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a policy report prepared by the American Medical Peer Review Assn. in 
January states: "Of the legislative proposals currently on the table, Clinton's 
Health Security Act goes the farthest in spelling out the functions and 
framework of a comprehensive quality management program."

LET'S NOT MAKE GUINEA PIGS OF PETS OR CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was somewhat taken aback by statements made by Georgia Mercer, Mayor 
Richard Riordan's West Valley representative, regarding coyote trapping (Valley 
Interview, Mar. 1). 
</P>
<P>
 She speaks of a "multifaceted" approach such as water drip systems to the 
hills to supply the coyotes with water, but we all know what makes up their 
food supply. 
</P>
<P>
 She speaks of spray repellent, but will it be used on our city streets as 
well? She speaks of education when we have been educated ad infinitum. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a multifaceted approach. The mayor's office seems to be suggesting 
an experiment, and our pets and children are the guinea pigs.

ATTEMPT TO PROLONG DOG'S LIFE WAS CRUEL

 * Although well-intended, the attempt to prolong the life of Bimbo, the dog

 Dogs have no concept of the human obsession with length of existence. They do 
understand what it is to be in agony.

 If it had been possible to save the dog and it had lived another 10 years, 
that would not have made up for the pain it was allowed to feel. It should have

PRISON'S SUDDEN CHANGING OF THE GUARD; PICKING A NEW WARDEN FOR THE 
PROBLEM-PLAGUED LANCASTER FACILITY IS A GOOD IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A significant management change was definitely in order at the California 
State Prison in Lancaster. Otis Thurman, it seems, has been given a few future 
employment options by the state Department of Corrections. Those suggestions 
apparently do not include staying on as warden of the year-old, problem-plagued 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster residents and elected officials undoubtedly recall that the 
$207-million, 252-acre, 4,000-inmate facility in west Lancaster was billed as 
being state-of-the-art and as escape-proof as possible. But the welcome mat 
also was out because of the effects that the prison's construction and 
operation would have on a beleaguered local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the facility's opening, however, there have been four escapes, two of 
them involving maximum-security inmates. All the escapees were recaptured, but 
not without some luck. One inmate who fled by stowing away in a garbage truck, 
for example, was compacted in a bale of trash and unceremoniously dumped in a 
local landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 And there have been sufficient problems inside the prison to lead to at least 
a few questions about how well inmates are being managed and controlled. So 
far, guards have shot and wounded four maximum-security prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of those incidents involved fights between inmates who could not be 
controlled. Yet another February fracas occurred when nearly a third of the 159 
inmates who were being subjected to body and cell searches decided to resist. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the latter might have been adequately explained by prison or 
corrections officials, but the early months of the Lancaster facility also have 
been marred by one horrendous public relations problem after another. You'll 
recall, for example, that it took prison officials two hours to notify local 
sheriff's deputies about the escape of an inmate serving a life sentence for 
murder without possibility of parole. Another nine hours passed before the 
Lancaster City Council was informed. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally disconcerting was the report released by Warden Thurman explaining why 
convicted killer Eric Rene Johnson was able to escape in the first place. 
Thurman blamed, in part, prison construction deficiencies and the fact that the 
supervising officer was distracted. 
</P>
<P>
 No and no, responded Tip Kindel, state corrections department assistant 
director, who contradicted the warden and instead blamed staff negligence and 
procedural inadequacies. 
</P>
<P>
 We're not sure which was worse, the gross discrepancy between explanations or 
the loud silence from the prison following Kindel's remarks. Consider it one 
more reason why picking a new warden is an eminently sensible idea.

OFFICER'S DEATH BRINGS BOTH SADNESS AND UNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The tragic death of Christy Lynne Hamilton has affected the entire 
community. Once again the ugly face of crime has impacted us, the officers that 
serve the community.We have had another member of our ever-so-small family 
taken away. 
</P>
<P>
 Though our spirits and feelings may be somber with our loss, Christy's death 
has brought out the community in their ever-present thoughtfulness and caring 
for the men and women of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Cards, letters, flowers and phone calls from the public have helped to relieve 
the sadness and sense of loss that is hanging over our heads. We will continue 
in our efforts to rid our communities of criminals so that we can make Los 
Angeles a safe place to live, work and play.

FACTS, NOT FICTION, SHOULD BE BASIS FOR LAND DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * North Los Angeles County is one of the most rapidly growing areas in 
Southern California. An unfortunate circumstance of this growth has been 
tremendous pressure upon all government services. Formulating a reasonable 
approach to addressing these challenges is difficult in the best of times but 
is made doubly difficult when egregious, patently misleading statements enter 
the debate. 
</P>
<P>
 A Valley Commentary article (Feb. 13) concerning the proposed replacement of 
the 33-year-old High Desert Hospital, originally built in Lancaster to provide 
tuberculosis care for inmates of the County Jail, is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
 In it, a local civic naysayer is given numerous column inches to spew 
distortions, inaccuracies and misstatements. For example, the author says that 
the Lancaster Redevelopment Agency intends to issue bonds to raise money to 
purchase the property, with Los Angeles County to repay the agency. This is 
false. 
</P>
<P>
 He says it should not be the site because it is in a flood hazard area. This 
is an equivocation that anyone "specializing in land for almost 30 years" knows 
leaves a false impression, since a fully improved concrete flood-control 
channel exists and will protect development of the site. 
</P>
<P>
 He says that it has poor soil that will need to be replaced and compacted at 
considerable cost. In fact, this has already been done by the current owner. 
</P>
<P>
 He says that $150,000 an acre is unreasonable, but he fails to point out that 
this property is zoned commercial and is projected to contribute millions of 
dollars to the Los Angeles County treasury as parcels are sold for hospital 
support uses, such as medical office buildings, in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 He says that the seller, Presley Development, will no longer have to pay its 
Mello-Roos bonds obligation. This is false. Presley is not relieved of its 
obligation to pay the special taxes with respect to the property to be 
transferred to the county for the hospital. On the contrary, Presley will be 
required to deposit millions of dollars into an escrow fund that will be used 
to pay the special taxes as they come due. 
</P>
<P>
 Projecting public service needs that taxpayers will be entitled to in the 
Antelope Valley five, 10 or 20 years from now is a challenging undertaking. The 
continued hodgepodge expansion of an antiquated county medical facility that 
will duplicate or erode the services of existing centers makes no sense. 
</P>
<P>
 However, neither does imagining impediments that will deny north Los Angeles 
County a facility that will surely be needed in the years to come. Common 
ground will be found for this debate. But fact, not fiction, must be the basis 
for a proper solution. 
</P>
<P>
 In summary, the diatribe that was published was long on fantasy and short on 
fact. Perhaps the only factual statement that the real estate "expert" included 
was that in finding other land, "Realtors and property owners would love to 
join in the hunt."

RESIDENTS SHOULD FIGHT CRIME -- NOT EACH OTHER; SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR 2 FEUDING 
GROUPS IN VAN NUYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Considerable attention has been devoted to the idea of giving Neighborhood 
Watch groups a formal disaster preparedness role. This comes at a time when 
their original crime-fighting role has never been more vital. What draws our 
attention this week, however, is the bitter feud between two such groups in Van 
Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, these two factions have the same goals and ought to be able to 
work together to help police thwart prostitution and drug crimes in their area. 
We also have a few rules of thumb on how citizens groups around the San 
Fernando Valley and its environs can be most effective and avoid unnecessary 
troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 In Van Nuys, the Town Keepers Action Group, headed by self-proclaimed citizen 
crime-fighter Mary Lou Holte, is at odds with a nearby Neighborhood Watch group 
led by lumber salesman Joseph Williams and his wife, Mary. The Williamses' 
group parades on the corner of Vanowen Street and Sepulveda Boulevard with 
video cameras, cellular phones, walkie-talkies and placards, warning 
prostitutes and their customers to stay away. Holte walks the streets urging 
the prostitutes and other crooks to get out, and she has made several citizen's 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 The Williamses say that Holte has gotten a lot of publicity for herself, and 
not much more. Holte says that the Williamses' efforts are just a publicity 
stunt. In fact, the squabble is a little ridiculous. The point is to expend 
energy on crime and the criminals, not on each other. Moreover, police have 
expressed concerns about the safety of both groups. "A lot of the (prostitutes) 
have pimps who have hired Southland gangs to protect them," said Officer Andrew 
Neiman of the Van Nuys squad. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first things to remember here that is you should not get so close 
to the action that you become a part of it. That appeared to have been the case 
in Hollywood late last year when a Neighborhood Watch volunteer got into a 
scuffle with an alleged drug dealer and wound up being charged with attempted 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 A particularly effective group of citizens in La Palma in Orange County has 
been given an order by police. "They're told to be good witnesses only," said 
Police Chief David Barr, "and not to take enforcement action of any kind." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of the Van Nuys citizens groups have received any formal police 
training on how to identify criminals. They ought to inquire about receiving 
such guidance. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the task of helping police fight crime should not be left 
to small numbers of brave citizens. It is hazardous to visibly track suspicious 
people and questionable activity when you are working alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The best example of this comes from North Hollywood, where anti-gang crusader 
Viviana Guerra was recently struck in the head by a rock thrown by suspected 
gang members. Guerra has received little or no help from her neighbors; that 
fact has only left the gang more emboldened. 
</P>
<P>
 Interested neighbors should start with a planning committee. Next, pick 
leaders and decide on the geographic boundaries of your efforts. Start with a 
small area. Keep police informed and seek their guidance at every step. 
Determine your neighborhood's crime problems and discuss solutions with police. 
Most important: Work together. The folks in Van Nuys ought to start there.

DROUGHT OF CLEAR THINKING ABOUT WATER; VALLEY RESIDENTS MAY FAVOR LOWER RATES, 
BUT CONSERVATION INCENTIVE SHOULD BE PRESERVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who says the San Fernando Valley has no clout at City Hall? Evidence to the 
contrary could be found in the recommendations of the Mayor's Blue Ribbon Panel 
on Water Rates. The panel recommended, as The Times reported last week, that 
the city drop a water-rate system that Valley homeowners consider punitive. The 
panel also wants a lower winter-rate structure maintained through the summer or 
until a more "equitable" rate system can be drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Riordan supports the panel recommendations -- although in this case the 
Valley's newfound clout was not put to very good use. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the water-rate system adopted in November, 1992, and enacted in January, 
1993, there were two payment tiers for residential customers. Those who used 
more than twice the median amount of water of the average Department of Water 
and Power customer were charged significantly higher rates, while the bills of 
smaller users were commensurately lower. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasoning behind this plan was sound, and it remains so. Los Angeles sits 
within a desert region, a situation that is not likely to change in the 
remaining years of this millennium or the next. It often has uncertain water 
supplies, and the new rate system encouraged conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another result was higher costs for those residents who have bigger lawns 
and live in the city's hottest regions, such as the Valley. Well, the system 
was meant to penalize those who use more of this region's most precious 
commodity and reward those who use less. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the plan may require fine-tuning. The new rate plan, for example, 
generated $4 million in surplus revenues last year. Its goal is still valid. If 
the big water users had consumed less than twice the amount of the average DWP 
customer, they would not have been subjected to the higher bills. That's a 
point that seems to have been missed.

SINGLE-PAYER SYSTEM MEANS MEDICAL SERFDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Wake up, Valley medical professionals: One of your colleagues is touting 
medical serfdom as a glorious future. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Melvin H. Kirschner (Valley Commentary, Feb. 27) trumpets 
government-monopoly medicine -- or, as he puts it, a single-payer system -- as 
the solution to the incompetence of the government-controlled insurance cartel. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical system is a maze of paper pushers because socialistic intervention 
in the economy requires a bureaucracy. Nationalization of medicine will drive 
the best out of the medical field, ruin pharmaceutical research and endanger 
patients with rationed treatments. Putting government in charge of the system 
will turn medical professionals into slaves of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Medicine is on the brink of becoming a giant postal service.

SCOPE WANTS TO PRESERVE THE SANTA CLARA RIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * James Harter's letter (Feb. 21) leaves the impression that the Santa Clarita 
Organization for Planning the Environment (SCOPE) is trying to hamstring poor 
family farmers trying to save their citrus groves from the Santa Clara River 
running wild. Yet Mr. Harter is a senior vice president of a firm which used 
yards and yards of concrete to channelize a portion of Bouquet Creek, a 
tributary of the Santa Clara, without bothering to obtain the necessary 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
 We are not talking about sandbags stemming a flood's sudden overflow. We are 
talking about expensively engineered concrete structures, costing millions of 
dollars, so that a major developer can build condominiums on what would 
otherwise be a natural flood plain. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these structures Mr. Harter's firm favors have concrete bottoms, as 
does the Los Angeles River. They have all the bucolic charm of a nuclear power 
plant and they prevent local recharge of our aquifers. These channels narrow 
the floodway and increase flow velocities, causing erosion problems for 
property owners downstream. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clara River is a significant ecological area, habitat to rare and 
endangered species, and the last significant (mostly) unchannelized river in 
Los Angeles County. SCOPE is committed to preserving the river in its natural 
form. 
</P>
<P>
 If Mr. Harter's firm is willing to remove some of its concrete monstrosities, 
we will be less likely to object to permits for sandbags or earthen berms to 
protect the citrus groves. Until we see that concession, we assert that Newhall 
Land's plans to channelize the Santa Clara with massive concrete flood control 
"improvements" should be subject to an objective federal environmental impact 
statement.

reality: Transit in the Valley is a patchwork quilt. Thousands of jobs are 
intermixed with thousands of residents. 
</P>
<P>
 This creates a vast crisscrossing of people going from home to work. And a 
huge number of non-work-related trips are generated each day. 
</P>
<P>
 As battles over rail are being fought, short-term, less expensive solutions 
can ease traffic with a minimum of environmental damage. One of them is 
restructuring the bus system. 
</P>
<P>
 First, here are some other transit options that might appear to offer hope for 
relief: 
</P>
<P>
 * Street-widening and cutting through existing streets -- very promising, with 
huge potential. What is needed is a commitment by the public and government 
that some streets must serve as major arteries. Oxnard Street, Riverside Drive, 
Saticoy Street, Magnolia Boulevard and other thoroughfares should be considered 
for major improvements. The removal of parking from some arteries, such as 
Victory Boulevard, should be considered. So should the "completion" of some 
streets, like Oxnard, now interrupted by the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reverse lanes and one-way streets -- of limited value. Traffic experts don't 
support reverse lanes unless there is a heavy a.m./p.m. traffic split, which is 
lacking on most Valley streets. And most of our major thoroughfares are too far 
apart to make one-way streets practical. 
</P>
<P>
 * High-occupancy-vehicle or exclusive bus lanes -- possibly useful, but 79% of 
Valley drivers drive alone. 
</P>
<P>
 * Heavy rail -- of limited use because it is inflexible and ill-suited to the 
Valley, which lacks a central business district where people go every morning 
and return from at night. The Northridge earthquake proves beyond a shadow of a 
doubt that the freeway is unsuitable as a site for an elevated train, whose 
collapse would close both the rail and freeway systems. 
</P>
<P>
 * Electric trolleys -- a good idea, but planners are moving in the wrong 
direction by rejecting it. Trolleys are pollution-free, quiet and flexible. 
They may either share the roadway with others or have exclusive lanes. They can 
be realigned to meet changing demand, require less maintenance than internal 
combustion engines and satisfy many federal mandates. In December, the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority ignored all this and, citing budget 
problems, voted to delay indefinitely its countywide trolley project. 
</P>
<P>
 This brings us back to buses, which do not serve Valley riders well for a 
variety of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Our present grid system is expensive to operate, since it relies mostly upon 
large, 80-passenger local buses during both daytime and evening. The buses make 
frequent stops, discouraging riders. Going from Studio City to Chatsworth, for 
example, requires a bus ride of an hour or more with dozens of stops. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The grid system provides nothing approximating door-to-door service. Large 
buses run only on main thoroughfares, so passengers must get to their bus stops 
and final destinations on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 For these and other reasons, only 3% of residents use the bus system. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cities have successfully installed a "pulsed," or hub-and-spoke, timed 
transfer bus system. Our planners should look closely at express buses, 
minivans and computer-based scheduling.  
</P>
<P>
 A pulsed bus system has two components -- express buses and local minivans. 
The minivans carry 10 to 12 passengers, perhaps 30 on some runs, and circulate 
through neighborhoods picking up passengers and taking them to express stops.  
</P>
<P>
 Express buses take passengers to destinations with only a few stops. When the 
passengers arrive, they take another minivan to their exact destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 During rush hours, minivans, express buses and other vehicles should depart at 
predetermined times. During slow periods, the rate of arrivals and departures 
could be adjusted to meet changing demand. Computers would track the arrival 
and departures of buses at major points and readjust the speed of the system to 
match that of traffic. A minivan could wait a few minutes for an express bus 
caught in traffic. In late evening, express buses could be replaced by 
minivans. 
</P>
<P>
 The system would save a lot of money. Light rail costs $3.40 per passenger 
mile; heavy rail, $1.50; city buses, 35 cents. A 10- to 12-passenger minivan 
costs only 10 to 15 cents per passenger mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Minivans can operate on narrow city and hillside streets. They are quieter and 
require less-skilled operators than big buses. They could be run by private 
contractors. At night they could replace underused large buses. In some cases 
it might be thriftier to drop buses and vans altogether and simply route a 
taxi. 
</P>
<P>
 Wouldn't it be wonderful if transit planners and politicians explored these 
ideas and they worked? Think of what could be done for this city with the 
billions of dollars that would be saved.

LAKERS STILL LOOK DEFENSELESS; PRO BASKETBALL: BULLETS CHEW THEM UP INSIDE AND 
OUT IN 124-118 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 College basketball has its March Madness, the Lakers have theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 They beat the Chicago Bulls. They lose to the Boston Celtics. They lose to the 
Washington Bullets. A third consecutive lottery-bound opponent, Milwaukee, is 
next up, but suddenly this isn't the favorable stretch of schedule the Lakers 
might have hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 The only soft part about Saturday night at USAir Arena was their defense, 
which watched Michael Adams bomb from the outside and then gave a wide berth to 
Tom Gugliotta and Don MacLean coming inside. The result before 18,756 was a 
124-118 victory for the Bullets, who came in averaging about 98 points a game, 
and more questions for the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Randy Pfund had been contemplating a change even before the game, 
considering the possibility of a small starting lineup with George Lynch at 
power forward instead of Elden Campbell and Doug Christie back at small 
forward. With the Lakers again going nowhere fast, losing for the seventh time 
in 10 games after an encouraging run, Pfund might experiment to see if a 
quicker lineup will mean better defense. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened Saturday -- the Bullets shooting 58.1% and four players scoring 
at least 22 points -- certainly won't change his thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 As MacLean noted after scoring 24 points and grabbing seven rebounds: "In the 
first half we talked about taking the ball to the basket more because nobody 
was contesting any shots." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullets scored 71 points in the first half to lead by 14, Adams doing most 
of the damage by going five for five on three-pointers in the first quarter. He 
had 19 points at intermission. Gugliotta had 15 on seven-of-seven shooting and 
MacLean scored 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you've got three out of five not defending guys," Pfund said, "you're 
going to have problems." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't help that this showing came a night after the Lakers, especially 
their forwards, were cut up by Dino Radja and the Celtics, surrendering 109 
points to a team averaging about 99 and on a 13-game losing streak. Then they 
got buried, 39-27, in the first quarter by the Atlantic Division's last-place 
team. The deficit got as high as 16 in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was everybody," Campbell said, deflecting part of the blame from his 
coach. "It was like they could do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Sedale Threatt, who had a season-high 32 points to lead the Lakers: "The 
whole game we were late on switches. They have great shooters. Take away one 
option, they have two more." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers got as close as three after three quarters, with Nick Van Exel 
making two more three-pointers, giving him 13 in three games, and scoring 13 
points. When Threatt connected with 3:16 to go in the game, they were down by 
six points, but then came the tough part -- defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullets scored on their next eight possessions, though that was partly 
because the Lakers fouled intentionally. Either way, that put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never felt all night that we could really stop them enough to win the 
game," Pfund said. "If you allow 71 points in a half, you are pretty much 
digging yourself a big-time hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose if you get specific about it, we could play one set of guys on 
offense and one set of guys on defense. If you work out one of these deals 
where you can change on the fly, like hockey, it might work a little better."

NBA ROUNDUP; HEAT STAYS HOT, WINS 7TH IN ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It doesn't get any better for the Miami Heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe it can get another game better. Or two. Or three. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heat established its first seven-game winning streak with a 120-83 victory 
over the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday night in Miami that was remarkable for 
the 37-point advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 That takes the Clippers out of the Miami record book. The Heat's biggest 
victory had been by 35 points against them in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind Glen Rice's 32 points, the victory also moved the Heat seven games over 
.500 for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is as fun as it can possibly be," said Miami center Rony Seikaly, who 
scored 22 points. "It hasn't been this fun since my college days." 
</P>
<P>
 The old-timers in the building could tell Seikaly to enjoy it while it lasts. 
The loss was Philadelphia's 12th in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what happens when a team that's really hot plays someone that's 
struggling like us," Clarence Weatherspoon said. "I think they're playing with 
a lot of fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Seikaly and Rice combined for 27 points in the first half as Miami built a 
60-41 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great feeling," Rice said. "I've been telling people all year that 
we've got the talent. What's been happening is we're playing to our level. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sky is the limit for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State 123, Charlotte 112 -- Latrell Sprewell missed 13 of his first 15 
shots, then led the Warriors' decisive third quarter with 14 points at Oakland, 
where they handed the Hornets their 16th loss in 17 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State led, 80-75, and then Sprewell scored 12 points in a 16-2 run to 
close the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 90, Indiana 88 -- Danny Manning drove from midcourt for the winning 
layup with 7.3 seconds to play at Atlanta, then blocked a shot by Byron Scott 
to give the Hawks their sixth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacers, who had won 14 of their previous 16 games, led, 86-83, with 2:08 
left before a layup by Kevin Willis and Mookie Blaylock's three-pointer put the 
Hawks ahead, 88-86. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Davis tied it with a dunk for Indiana before Craig Ehlo inbounded to 
Manning at midcourt. He drove to the basket, giving the Hawks a 4-0 record 
since he joined the team in a trade for Dominique Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 103, Dallas 90 -- Karl Malone had 34 points and 13 rebounds, helping the 
Jazz extend its season-best winning streak to eight games at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamal Mashburn had 22 points and Jim Jackson 20 for the Mavericks, who lost 
their fourth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 117, Detroit 108 -- Jon Barry scored two baskets in a 6-0 run that 
gave the Bucks the lead for good in the fourth quarter, and Eric Murdock had 28 
points at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Dumars had 42 points for the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Vin Baker had 24 points, 10 rebounds and six assists for the Bucks, who 
are four games ahead of the last-place Pistons in the Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 114, Sacramento 98 -- Shawn Kemp had 25 points and 14 rebounds and 
sparked a third-quarter rally at Seattle that lifted the SuperSonics to their 
fourth victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle is 23-3 at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp didn't start because of a sore right elbow, but he was ready in the third 
quarter, scoring 14 points as Seattle outscored Sacramento, 34-19.

AILING CLIPPERS GET CLOCKED IN HOUSTON; PRO BASKETBALL: BIG DEFICIT COMBINED 
WITH INJURIES TO WILKINS, HARPER AND VAUGHT TOO MUCH IN 124-107 LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As a worker tried to repair a malfunctioning 24-second clock atop the Clipper 
basket before Saturday night's game against the Houston Rockets, Clipper Coach 
Bob Weiss quipped: "If it takes long enough, we might have some guys get 
healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Although his team had only nine fit players, at least Weiss didn't lose his 
sense of humor after watching his team fall behind by 28 points and lose, 
124-107, before a crowd of 15,009 at the Summit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Except for the offense, defense, rebounding and the turnovers, we had a good 
game," Weiss said after the Clippers (19-38) lost for the ninth time in their 
last 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss probably wouldn't have minded if they had played the game with a running 
clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Jones, the Clipper trainer, was the hardest working man on the team 
because he was busy treating the injuries that sidelined two starters and 
hampered All-Star forward Dominique Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Ron Harper, the Clippers' second leading scorer who missed his second 
game in a row because of a strained left hamstring, did color commentary with 
Clipper broadcaster Ralph Lawler. Forward Loy Vaught, the Clippers' leading 
rebounder, missed the game because of a hip injury and reserve forward Tom 
Tolbert sat out his second straight game because of a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins almost didn't play after spraining his left wrist and thumb when he 
caught the thumb in the jersey of Spur forward J.R. Reid as they were fighting 
for position in the third quarter of Friday night's 121-113 loss at San 
Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last night I couldn't even sleep," Wilkins said. "My hand was throbbing. I 
couldn't grip onto anything. It's almost like a dislocation." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins had Jones tape his wrist and decided to play after testing it before 
the game, but he said the tape, which was wrapped around his thumb and wrist, 
was too restrictive and played most of the game with only his wrist taped. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, who had averaged 32.3 points and shot 53.3% in his first four games 
with the Clippers, made only nine of 23 shots and scored 20 points in 31 
minutes as the Rockets double-teamed him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hurting real bad," Wilkins said after the game. "I couldn't get 
comfortable where I could put my shoulder down and go to the bucket. I retaped 
it, but it was still sore. I couldn't get a fluid motion on my shots. My shots 
were going off to the left. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very easy to sit down and watch the game from the sideline, but that 
ain't me. If I can help, I'm going to be there. I'm not going to let the guys 
go to war by themselves, I'm going to be with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss inserted rookie forward Charles Outlaw in place of Vaught and rookie 
guard Terry Dehere, who scored a season-high 17 points against the Spurs, for 
Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlaw, who will be signed for the rest of the season after his second 10-day 
contract expires today, had season-highs of 17 points and 11 rebounds, but 
Dehere missed 12 of 15 shots and scored only seven points. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 24 hours after watching San Antonio center David Robinson get 41 points, 
16 rebounds and eight assists against them, the Clippers faced Rocket center 
Hakeem Olajuwon, who maintains that he deserves the NBA MVP award this season 
after finishing second to Charles Barkley last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon finished with 30 points, 12 rebounds, five assists and three blocked 
shots. Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Loy Vaught, who injured his left hip Friday night at San Antonio, 
thinks he might miss an extended period. If Vaught is put on the injured list, 
the Clippers will probably activate center Bob Martin, who was put on the 
injured list on Feb. 14 with a strained abdominal muscle. . . . Ron Harper, who 
hasn't talked to the media since being suspended for one game for making 
negative remarks about the team, said during the radio broadcast that he hopes 
to play in Tuesday night's game at Dallas. "I think five days off is enough," 
Harper said.

GOLF / DAN HAFNER; AT 50, SIGEL FINALLY GOING AGAINST THE BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senior PGA Tour and a challenge issued by Jack Nicklaus have given Jay 
Sigel an opportunity to answer, at least partially, a question that has been 
asked many times. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly two decades, Sigel has been the best amateur golfer in the world -- 
the best, according to Lee Trevino, "to come down the pike since Bobby Jones." 
</P>
<P>
 A freak accident in 1963, in which his left hand was badly cut, deprived Sigel 
of a chance to become a professional golfer. At the time, his only ambition had 
been to join the PGA Tour. Missing this was a major blow, but looking back he 
sees the injury as a blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 After a long recovery period, Sigel became the premier amateur, winning 
consecutive U.S Amateurs, playing on a record nine Walker Cup teams and winning 
the British Amateur. In addition, he was low amateur at least once in all of 
the major tournaments that permit amateurs to enter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't trade the amateur experience for all the money in the world, " 
said Sigel, who is playing in his fourth senior event this week at Ojai. "I'm 
not just talking about the tournaments I won. It's the people I met, the honors 
and a lot of other things. 
</P>
<P>
 "More important, I might never have met my wife or had a family." 
</P>
<P>
 But always, there was the question: Could Sigel have made it against the likes 
of Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Gary Player? 
</P>
<P>
 Sigel turned 50 last November, giving him a chance to partially, if belatedly, 
answer that question. He was already thinking about taking his best shot as a 
pro on the senior circuit. But it took a talk with Nicklaus to provide the 
final impetus that sent Sigel into the senior qualifying school last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jack said I had a choice," Sigel said, "but he added that I had won all the 
honors anyone could get as an amateur and they could never be taken away. But 
unless I gave it a try, I would never know if I could make it in the pros. 'You 
have the ability,' Jack said, 'but it's up to you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sigel finished 11th at the school, meaning that he needed a sponsor's 
exemption or at least have three who placed higher than him not enter a 
tournament for him to be eligible for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never played in more than 12 tournaments in any year as an amateur," Sigel 
said, "and I never played from October to March. It has meant a change in 
lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't be here if I didn't think I could do well. After three 
tournaments, I know I belong."  
</P>
<P>
 Sigel was attending summer school as a sophomore at Wake Forest 31 years ago 
when the mishap occurred. Only a few weeks before, he had won the Atlantic 
Coast Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone went out the door of our fraternity in front of me, and I reached out 
to catch the door before it closed," Sigel said. "Instead of catching the 
frame, I rammed my left hand through the glass. The doctor that sewed me up 
quit counting after 70 stitches. He'd reached par. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hand didn't stop hurting for five years and I didn't start playing a good 
game again for 10 years. By that time, I had a family and an insurance 
business. It was really a blessing. I probably would have been just another 
pro, not a great one. And all the amateur honors would never have been mine." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1974, he was competitive, and in 1977 he began his record-breaking Walker 
Cup streak. In 1982, he won the U.S. Amateur, then repeated as champion the 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a finalist for the Sullivan Award one year," Sigel said, "and was 
sitting next to the winner, Edwin Moses. He was astounded to learn that I paid 
all my own golf fees and earned only trophies when I won. He wanted to set up a 
foundation to pay my expenses. I finally made him understand that probably the 
only real amateur sport left is amateur golf." 
</P>
<P>
 Sigel has already shown the 50-and-older group that he belongs. At Naples, 
Fla., two weeks ago, he opened with a 65 to lead the tournament, then stayed in 
contention until the final nine before finishing sixth. Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Sigel, Australian Graham Marsh and England's Tony Jacklin will join the 
Senior PGA Tour this year. In 1995, Hale Irwin plans to come aboard, and the 
next year, Hubert Green and Gil Morgan will both turn 50.

LOYOLA OUSTED FROM TOURNAMENT AS GONZAGA EXPLOITS TURNOVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as fast as Loyola Marymount gained the momentum Saturday night, the Lions 
lost it. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Gonzaga, after having a 15-point lead cut to four in the second 
half, pulled away in the final three minutes for a 91-76 victory in the first 
round of the West Coast Conference tournament at Santa Clara's Toso Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola (6-21) had moved within 75-71 on a three-point play by center Ime Odouk 
with 3:39 left. But after a timeout, Gonzaga (21-6) went on a 12-0 run to 
regain control. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions, who handed champion Gonzaga one of its two conference losses, never 
led but managed to stay close by making 11 of 20 three-point shots after 
starting 10 of 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions, however, committed 25 turnovers, 16 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Robin Kirksey's 17 points led Loyola, which has not won a WCC tournament 
game since 1990. ROB FERNAS

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / WEST COAST CONFERENCE TOURNAMENT; PEPPERDINE ADVANCES TO 
SEMIFINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Through the highs and lows of Pepperdine's streaky season, the one constant 
has been the play of Dana Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior forward came through again Saturday, leading a second-half surge 
that carried the Waves to a 79-62 victory over St. Mary's in the first round of 
the West Coast Conference tournament at Santa Clara's Toso Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 By beating the Gaels (13-14) for the 13th consecutive time, Pepperdine (17-10) 
advanced to tonight's semifinals at about 7:30 against San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones scored 16 of his game-high 27 points in the second half, when Pepperdine 
erased a three-point deficit, and also led all players with 13 rebounds, four 
steals and two blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad I recruited him," Wave Coach Tom Asbury deadpanned after his team's 
fifth consecutive victory. "He played terrific. Arguably he's the best player 
we've ever had at Pepperdine. I've been there for 15 years, and he's the best 
player I've ever coached." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, a three-time all-conference selection, has picked up his game in recent 
weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have an answer for him," St. Mary's Coach Ernie Kent said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones blamed a lack of intensity for Pepperdine's poor first half. St. Mary's, 
which lost to the Waves by 20 and 23 points in the regular season, took a 12-4 
lead and stayed close until midway through the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were playing harder than us," Jones said. "We turned it up in the second 
half. It contributed to our defense, and that picked up our offense." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, fouled after his third dunk of the second half, made the free throw to 
give Pepperdine a 64-50 lead with 3:40 to play. St. Mary's shot only 32.1% in 
the second half and 35.8% for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Derek Noether helped take inside pressure off of Jones by scoring 12 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 63, Portland 57 -- Guard Doug Harris had 20 points, five assists and 
three steals to lead the Toreros (17-10) to their first tournament victory 
since 1991. Forward Brooks Barnhard added 15 points, including a three-point 
play that gave San Diego the lead for good, 50-48, with 6:29 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 76, Santa Clara 74 -- Guard Gerald Walker scored the Dons' last 
10 points, including an 18-foot jump shot with three seconds left, to beat the 
defending tournament champions on their home court. Walker led San Francisco 
(17-10) with 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara (13-14) had tied the score, 74-74, on two three-point baskets by 
guard Steve Nash.

<P>
 Emmett Hall stood alone in victory after being left alone under the basket for 
the winning basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall's layup from the right side with three seconds to go gave South Carolina 
a 75-74 victory over No. 7 Kentucky on Saturday, preventing the Wildcats from 
clinching the Southeastern Conference Eastern Division title. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Hall jumped atop a chair and stretched out his arms to relish the 
Gamecocks' victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just remember thinking, 'The game is over,' " Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall, a senior, finished with 20 points and 13 rebounds and Donnie Mathews had 
all 14 of his points in the second half for South Carolina (8-18, 4-12), which 
beat a ranked team for the first time since defeating Temple on Dec. 8, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodrick Rhodes had 24 points to lead Kentucky (23-6, 12-4), which saw its 
five-game winning streak end. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats shot only 38.6% and were held to their second-lowest point total 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't play as well as we were capable of, but still they played great 
basketball," said Travis Ford, held to six points for Kentucky. "I just didn't 
lead this team like I should have."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NATIONAL ROUNDUP; STAKES DON'T MATTER: NORTH CAROLINA 
BEATS DUKE, 87-77 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Duke had already wrapped up the Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season 
title, and North Carolina was second. If form holds, they will play for the 
league tournament championship in a week. Neither will be seeded worse than 
second in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 But there still was the rivalry to think of. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 5 North Carolina broke the game open with a 15-5 run in the waning moments 
of an 87-77 victory over the No. 2 Blue Devils at Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best we've played all year," said Dean Smith, coach of North 
Carolina (24-6, 11-5). "I thought it was just a tremendously well-played game." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Coach Mike Krzyzewski of Duke (22-4, 12-4): "It was a terrific basketball 
game, absolutely a terrific game. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wore us out, and that was apparent over the last 10 minutes of the game. 
We just couldn't stop them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Devils had only 10 points over the last six minutes, and four of 
those came in the final 40 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina's Donald Williams finished with 20 points, most coming on 
drives. He was one for three on three-pointers, but the one he made turned the 
game around. 
</P>
<P>
 A dunk by Eric Meek brought Duke within 68-66 with 6:45 to play. Rasheed 
Wallace came back with a dunk at the other end, and then Williams made the 
three-pointer with 6:12 left and North Carolina led the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace had 14 points for North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherokee Parks scored 23 points to lead Duke, which had won five in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1 Arkansas 80, Mississippi State 62 -- Corliss Williamson made five of six 
free throws in the final minutes and added two field goals as the Razorbacks 
held off the Bulldogs (17-9, 9-7) in a Southeastern Conference game at 
Fayetteville, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas (24-2, 14-2) clinched its second Southeastern Conference championship 
in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 4 Connecticut 95, St. John's 80 -- The Huskies got 29 points from Donyell 
Marshall, who now has 461 this season, a Big East record, and Connecticut set a 
school record with 26 victories in beating St. John's at Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
 Connecticut (26-3, 16-2) became the winningest team in league history, 
finished 15-0 at home and sent St. John's (11-16, 5-13) to its worst record in 
school history. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless St. John's wins the Big East tournament, it will be the first time the 
Redmen haven't played in the postseason since 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 6 Missouri 80, Nebraska 78 -- The Tigers got their unbeaten Big Eight 
season the hard way, needing Melvin Booker's three-point play with 12.5 seconds 
left at Columbia, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri (24-2, 14-0) became the first school in 23 years to beat each Big 
Eight team twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska (17-9, 7-7) got 26 points from Eric Piatkowski. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 17 Florida 82, Tennessee 71 -- Dan Cross scored 14 points during a 
five-minute stretch of the second half as the Gators (23-6, 12-4) won at 
Gainesville, Fla., to tie Kentucky for first place in the Southeastern 
Conference Eastern Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Whitten led Tennessee (5-21, 2-14). 
</P>
<P>
 No. 18 Minnesota 107, Iowa 96 -- Townsend Orr scored six of his 12 points in 
the third overtime and Voshon Lenard had a career-high 38 points in the Big Ten 
game as the Gophers (20-10, 10-7) won at home to have consecutive 20-victory 
seasons for the first time ever. Russ Millard scored 22 points and Jess Settles 
21 for the Hawkeyes (10-15, 4-12). 
</P>
<P>
 No. 21 Oklahoma State 83, Colorado 68 -- Three-pointers by Randy Rutherford 
and Brooks Thompson started a late surge at Stillwater, Okla., where the 
Cowboys (21-8, 10-4) overcame a career-high 46 points by Donnie Boyce of 
Colorado (10-16, 2-12) in a Big Eight game. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 24 Alabama Birmingham 85, No. 16 St. Louis 70 -- Reginald Allen had 18 
points in the first half en route to a 27-point day for the Blazers (22-6, 
8-4), who used a 30-10 run to beat St. Louis (22-4, 8-4) in a Great Midwest 
Conference game at Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 22 Marquette 73, Wisconsin Milwaukee 51 -- Damon Key had 17 points and 
Roney Eford scored all 16 of his in the second half to lead the Warriors at

series that began in 1916-17. 
</P>
<P>
 Providence 77, No. 23 Boston College 69 -- Michael Brown scored 22 points in

BASEBALL NOTES; NEXT EXPANSION MAY IMPACT SPRING TRAINING SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HENNEMAN, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The principal cities involved, Phoenix and the Tampa Bay area, couldn't care 
less, but baseball's next expansion could be extremely disruptive to a lot of 
spring training camps. 
</P>
<P>
 There are seven major-league teams training in the Phoenix area. Two others 
are within the city limits of St. Petersburg, with three others in the 
immediate surrounding counties. 
</P>
<P>
 If Phoenix and Tampa Bay get the next two expansion franchises, as is likely, 
40 percent of the major-league baseball organizations would suddenly find 
themselves training in an area that has its own team. That would make 
exhibition games far less attractive to the permanent residents and severely 
limit the media exposure now available to teams that train in Arizona and 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baltimore Orioles moved out of Miami four years ago, long after that city 
had outgrown its status as nothing more than a spring training site. The New 
York Yankees, who have been successful in Fort Lauderdale for 33 years, are on 
the verge of moving their spring training operation to Tampa. Whether another 
team would move into a facility located in the heart of Florida Marlins 
territory is questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 The erection of state-of-the-art complexes has been big in Florida and Arizona 
for the past decade. How, or why, the Orioles have been looking unsuccessfully 
at least that long for a new spring home is one of the game's big mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Such facilities are no longer popping up as fast as "cookie-cutter" golf 
course developments. And, with major-league possibilities on the horizon, the 
states of Florida and Arizona are no longer trying to lure teams for spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 They're talking about the real thing. And if Tampa Bay and Phoenix gain 
admission to the Big Show, some of the teams training in those areas might have 
to re-evaluate their situations. It's difficult to see how seven teams could 
continue to prosper in the Phoenix area and five others in the vicinity of St. 
Petersburg if those cities have teams of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The scramble for spring training sites could start all over again, meaning the 
field would have lapped the Orioles and everybody would again be on a level 
field. 
</P>
<P>

 Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Dave Stewart is trying to forget the incident that 
put him in a Tampa jail two weeks ago. But the veteran right-hander, arrested 
with teammate Todd Stottlemyre and accused of punching a police officer after a 
nightclub scuffle, insists he is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't do anything wrong," said Stewart, who had been celebrating his 
birthday. "I've built a real strong reputation -- you don't have to be a 
baseball fan to know what I stand for and what I believe in. 
</P>
<P>
 "A police force is trying to make me look a certain way, but I've never been 
known to strike at anybody unless I'm provoked. I didn't hit anyone. That's not 
something you wouldn't remember. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you punch somebody, it's like (things go) in slow motion. You don't 
forget something like that." 
</P>
<P>
 There has been no disposition and little has been said publicly since the 
incident occurred. "No news is good news," Stewart said. "I think the best 
thing is to let people sit back and relax and let it settle down." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With Whitey Herzog out of the picture, and Bill Bavasi in the general 
manager's office, the Angels appear to have taken a page from the Cleveland 
Indians' negotiating manual. In signing Tim Salmon , Chad Curtis and Gary 
DiSarcina to long-term contracts, the Angels overpaid up front in exchange for 
two arbitration-free years from each player. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis and DiSarcina, who signed three-year deals for $4.5 and $2.5 million, 
respectively, are both two-year players who would've been eligible for 
arbitration next year. Salmon, who got $7.5 million for four years, was two 
years away from arbitration eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on his performance last year (31 home runs, 95 RBI), Salmon would have 
been worth far more than his contract's average of $1.875 million when he 
became eligible for arbitration. But the ledger is balanced by the fact that 
the Angels were obligated to pay him no more than minimum salary (currently 
$109,000) for the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The effects of the contract are difficult to weigh at the moment, and 
represent a gamble to a certain extent by both sides. But there's one thing of 
which you can be sure -- by the time the contracts expire they will be outdated 
and one side will feel like it made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon's contract is the largest ever for a second-year player, exceeding the 
$4.2 million, three-year deal the Los Angeles Dodgers gave to catcher Mike 
Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the other teams that have tried getting long-term commitments from their 
young players before they become eligible for arbitration, the Indians have had 
the most success. The White Sox tried a similar tactic, but were accused of 
strong-armed negotiation policies. That's one of the chief reasons Cy Young 
Award winner Jack McDowell has had a long-running feud with White Sox owner 
Jerry Reinsdorf. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians, on the other hand, used a low-keyed approach, which not only was 
successful, but has helped establish a feeling of team unity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As World Series heroes go, the Blue Jays' Joe Carter was about as invisible as 
possible during the off-season. It wasn't by accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did two appearances -- the Arsenio Hall Show and Bobby Bonilla's charity 
bowling tournament," Carter said. "That's the way I like it. I had a request to 
do something every day if I wanted to, but I didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't going to go out seeking to capitalize on my good fortune," said 
Carter, who ended last year's World Series with a three-run home run off Mitch 
Williams. "To take time away from my family to do endorse ments was not in my 
best interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "People's perspective of me has changed from before the home run to after, but 
mine hasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The latest guy on the hot seat in New York isn't New York Yankees Manager Buck 
Showalter, or any of his players. Rather it's rookie third-base coach Willie 
Randolph, who knows the perils of the job all too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Randolph was the runner who got thrown out at home during the 1980 playoffs -- 
the play that influenced owner George Steinbrenner to insist Mike Ferraro be 
removed from the third-base coach's box. It also was part of a developing rift 
with the late Dick Howser, who was dropped as manager despite winning 103 
games. Howser's refusal to fire Ferraro, who coached third base for the Orioles 
last year, was a contributing factor to his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never even thought that play would be close," said Randolph, who has a 
vivid recollection of the play even after 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Randolph took a strange route to his new job -- leaving a position as 
assistant to general manager Gene Michael to return to the field. After taking 
the job last year, Randolph reported to the Yankees' Instructional League team 
last fall to prepare himself for a job that is thankless even to the most 
experienced. 
</P>
<P>
 Before going to spring training, Randolph stood in front of a full-length 
mirror and practiced giving signs. "My kids thought I was crazy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If he can find somebody else to bat in the No. 1 spot, Oakland Manager Tony La 
Russa has said he would consider switching Rickey Henderson to the third 
position in the A's lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of pitchers are hoping La Russa is successful in finding another leadoff 
hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Not having to face Henderson as the first hitter of the game, and the 
possibility of having two outs and nobody on base before he makes an 
appearance, has to be appealing to American League pitchers. Batting third 
would also seem to restrict Henderson's stolen-base attempts, because he could 
effectively take the bat out of the hands of either Ruben Sierra or Mark 
McGwire by leaving first base open. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no question that Henderson has the goods -- speed, average and power 
-- to bat third. But that would be more than offset by losing the best leadoff 
hitter who ever played the game.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL; LESLIE HELPS USC PULL AWAY FROM UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The USC women's basketball team cleared a major hurdle toward a Pacific 10 
Conference championship Saturday night, sweeping aside UCLA, 83-66, before 
3,629 at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins played without All-American center Natalie Williams -- whose season 
was ended last weekend by a knee injury -- but they rallied back from a 12-0 
USC run that started the game. 
</P>
<P>
 But UCLA had no such surges left at the finish, not after USC had built a lead 
that in the late going reached 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Leslie led USC, scoring 24 points, grabbing 15 rebounds and blocking five 
shots in 26 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 In the three-team race for the conference championship, Oregon faltered 
Saturday, losing at home to Stanford, 72-60. So USC can wrap up the Pac-10 
title at home next weekend by beating both Oregon and Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans (21-3) are 14-2 in conference play. They are a game ahead of 
Stanford, which beat USC, 80-50, on Feb. 24, and two ahead of Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA fell to 15-10, 10-6.  
</P>
<P>
 How much did Williams' absence mean?  
</P>
<P>
 "It hurt our confidence," UCLA Coach Kathy Olivier said. "Having her in there 
as our go-to player. . . . We missed her." 
</P>
<P>
 Said USC Coach Cheryl Miller, who after the Stanford loss predicted her team 
wouldn't lose again this season: "Natalie is a great offensive rebounder, and 
as athletic as she is, I knew it would be difficult for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie's 15 rebounds carried her past Williams as the Pac-10's all-time 
rebound leader, 1,142 to 1,137. 
</P>
<P>
 When USC ran off to early leads of 12-0 and 17-2, UCLA's Amy Jalewalia, Kisa 
Hughes and Detra Lockhart brought the Bruins back to trail by only 22-19, 
forcing Miller to call a timeout with 11:12 left in the half.  
</P>
<P>
 After that, USC was never in serious difficulty. In four minutes, the Trojans 
had a 10-point lead, and they stretched that to 51-35 by halftime.  
</P>
<P>
 Hughes finished with 18 points, Jalewalia 17 and Lockhart 16.

FULLERTON ROLLS DESPITE DROUGHT

<P>
 Cal State Fullerton went 7 minutes 42 seconds in the second half without 
scoring Saturday but still managed to defeat UC Santa Barbara, 79-63, in a Big 
West Conference game in Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Little scored 20 points, Winston Peterson had 16 points and nine 
rebounds, and senior guard Greg Vernon had 13 points, eight assists and eight 
rebounds in the final home game of his four-year Fullerton career, as the 
Titans improved to 8-18, 6-12. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton took a 63-47 lead on Peterson's jump hook with 11:12 remaining but 
didn't score again until Little's free throws with 3:29 left. The Gauchos 
(13-16, 9-9) scored nine consecutive points to make it 63-56 with 5:50 to go, 
but poor shooting -- they shot 34.2% from the field -- prevented a bigger 
comeback. MIKE DiGIOVANNA

LONG BEACH HITS LONG, SHORT IN BEATING IRVINE

<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine, employing a stand-around offense and watch-them-run-and-dunk 
defense, ended the regular season with the weakest of whimpers Saturday night 
in a 91-72 defeat to Long Beach State before 2,849 at the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time these teams met, it took two overtimes to decide a winner.This 
one was over long before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (17-9, 11-7) made five of its first six three-point shots. Of the 
49ers' first 16 two-point baskets, 15 were either layups or dunks against the 
porous defense of Irvine (7-19, 4-14). 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers led, 46-22, at halftime and it was 55-23 after 3 1/2 minutes of the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach will finish in either a three- or four-way tie for second in the 
conference, depending on the outcome of today's Nevada Las Vegas-Pacific game, 
and will be third seeded in the Big West tournament at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine is 10th-seeded and will play No. 7 Santa Barbara. JOHN WEYLER

<P>
 The Burbank Burroughs boys' soccer team saw its 12-game winning streak end in 
a 3-1 loss to Bell Gardens for the Southern Section Division III championship 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was very physical and included four yellow cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Burrough's top threat, senior midfielder Roberto Perez, was held scoreless and 
limited to one shot. Perez had seven goals in four playoff games and a total of 
17 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our game plan was to keep No. 13 (Perez) off the ball as much as possible," 
said Orlando Brenes, Bell Gardens coach. "We did it, and it worked." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Gardens (21-5-3) won its third Southern Section title. Gustavo Garito, 
Jamie Olivarez and Robert Arredondo scored Bell Gardens' goals, all in the 
second half. Arredondo's goal came on a penalty kick with less than two minutes 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Gret Guenther scored Burroughs' only goal at 59:41. The Indians finished 
15-7-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Mater Dei 4, Anaheim Esperanza 1 -- Mater Dei scored three goals in 
the second half to win the boys' Division II title. Junior midfielder Rudy 
Gomez scored twice for the Monarchs (24-2-4). Senior forwards Kevin Quigley and 
John Gerdis each had a goal in the second half. Junior halfback Ryan Piekarski 
scored Esperanza's (18-6-5) only goal at the 68:06 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside Poly 2, El Monte 0 -- Forward Ryan Robson scored a goal with under 
two minutes to play to give the boys' Division IV title to top-seeded Poly 
(29-0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance Bishop Montgomery 1, Anaheim Esperanza 0 -- Senior halfback Rachel 
Moseley scored the game's only goal a little more than 12 minutes into the game 
to give Bishop Montgomery the girls' Division II title. The Knights finished 
the season at 21-2-2 and Esperanza 19-6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside Poly 2, Whittier La Serna 0 -- Poly (28-2) scored both goals in 
overtime to win the girls' Division III championship. Senior forward Sarah 
Strange got the first one and senior fullback Tara Fontana scored the second. 
La Serna finished 22-4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena Poly 4, Palos Verdes Chadwick 1 -- Pasadena Poly (28-1) became the 
first team in section history to win four consecutive soccer championships in 
the girls' Division IV title game. The Panthers were led by senior Blanca 
Fromm's three goals. Chadwick ended the season 18-4.

 Brea-Olinda, three-time defending state girls' champion and top-ranked by The 
Times, lived up to expectations with a 70-40 victory over No. 17 Newport Harbor

was Brea's sixth in a row. 
</P>
<P>

will happen." MARTIN HENDERSON

 Jelani Gardner, a 6-foot-6 senior point guard, scored 12 of his 24 points in 
the fourth quarter to carry No. 6-ranked Bellflower St. John Bosco to a 55-54 
victory over No. 3 Compton Dominguez High in the Southern Section Division II-A 
championship at Anaheim Arena on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to throw everything at him we could and get the ball out of his 
hands," said Dominguez Coach Russell Otis. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading 53-51, St. John Bosco (28-2) got possession after a steal by Gardner 
with 24 seconds left. Gardner was fouled with 10 seconds to play, and he hit 
two free throws to culminate a 7-0 run that made it 55-51. Jaimie Gillin of 
Dominguez hit a three-pointer at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 Their 17th consecutive victory gave the Braves their first section title. The 
loss ended a 17-game winning streak by Dominguez (27-3), which has now lost two 
title games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons hit two of six free throws; the Braves 11 of 15. BARRY BAUM

<P>
 The magic could only last so long. 
</P>
<P>
 For 17th-ranked Crescenta Valley, which overcame overwhelming odds to advance 
to the Southern Section Division I-AA final against seventh-ranked Long Beach 
Poly, the magic ran out in the second half Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Poly defeated Crescenta Valley, 71-60, at Anaheim Arena to win its 14th 
section title. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley had an 18-16 lead at halftime, but the Jackrabbits (25-6) 
pulled ahead for good by outscoring the Falcons, 30-13, in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons (19-10) never got closer than five points in the second half, and 
the Jackrabbits led by as many as 18 points in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Brock Jacobsen led all scorers with 28 points for Crescenta Valley, including 
four three-pointers, and Richard O'Neill finished with 21 points. Damion Dawson 
led Poly with 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 4 Inglewood 77, No. 5 Riverside North 59 -- Paul Pierce has done for 
Inglewood High what no other player has been able to do for the school in the 
past 13 years: he has given it a Southern Section championship. 
</P>
<P>
 At Anaheim Arena, Pierce scored the first seven points of the game, including 
two three-point baskets, to give the Sentinels (28-3) a lead they never 
relinquished in the Division II-AA championship. He finished with 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The closest the game got was when North's Anderson Chilavo scored eight points 
to lead the Huskies on a 10-4 run over the first five minutes of the second 
quarter to make the score 24-20. Chilavo scored a game-high 29 points for North 
(28-1), the defending divisional champion. 
</P>
<P>
 But Inglewood's Sam Turks made two layups in the next minute to steal North's 
momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Shelto added 20 points and had a game-high 12 rebounds for Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one starter returned this season from last season's championship team for 
North, point guard Demond Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jackson suffered a sprained ankle in practice last week and played only 14 
minutes on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santa Margartia 67, Anaheim Servite 53 -- Santa Margarita scored the 
game's first 10 points and never looked back en route to its victory in the 
III-AA championship at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles (24-6) shot 57%, outrebounded Servite, and led by as many as 21 
points in the third quarter to win the school's first sectional basketball 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite (20-9) missed its first seven shots and shot only 36% for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Finneran of Santa Margarita scored 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 19 Garden Grove Pacifica 63, San Dimas 49 -- Trailing at halftime, 
Pacifica readjusted its defense in the third quarter and won the III-A 
championship at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Veal of San Dimas (24-5) scored 15 points in 18 minutes to help the 
Saints to a 27-25 lead. But he was held to four points the rest of the way 
after Pacifica (27-1) started double-teaming him. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Surface led the Mariners with a game-high 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood Campbell Hall 46, Pasadena Poly 43 -- Alex Lopez scored 19 
points and had six blocked shots as Campbell Hall (21-8) won its second 
Division V-AA title in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 At Pepperdine, Lopez's three-point play with about a minute to play gave the 
Vikings a 43-37 lead. Pasadena Poly (21-5) rallied to within one with four 
seconds remaining, but Jim Snodgrass made two free throws to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers were led by Cameron Murphy's 12 points and 13 rebounds. WENDY

HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS' BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS; LYNWOOD KEEPS DIVISION I-AA TITLE

 Lynwood, ranked No. 2 by The Times, retained its Southern Section Division 
I-AA championship by defeating Palos Verdes Peninsula, 53-46, at Cal Poly 
Pomona on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood (29-1), whose only loss is to Brea-Olinda, is also the defending state 
Division I champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula (24-4), which defeated Lynwood in the 1992 section title game, 
rallied to overcome a 15-point deficit in the third quarter and led by one 
point with two minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But Knight guard Tawana Grimes scored five consecutive points to seal the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior forward Tamicha Kirby led all scorers with 22 points, and Grimes added 
13. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 3 Mission Hills Alemany 49, No. 9 San Bernardino 46 -- Alemany kept its 
perfect season intact -- barely. 
</P>
<P>
 The third-ranked Indians (28-0) had to weather a 26-point second-half outburst 
by San Bernardino guard LaTonya Kindle, but they held on in the Division II-A 
championship at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 Kindle made a three-pointer to give the Cardinals (25-5) a three-point lead 
with less than three minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alemany regrouped and scored the game's final six points. 
</P>
<P>
 Kindle scored a game-high 34 points and had eight steals. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 5 Irvine Woodbridge 59, No. 15 Hemet 47 -- Melanie Pearson scored four of 
her game-high 16 points during a 10-1 run at the end of the third quarter to 
lead Woodbridge (29-0) to the Division II-AA championship at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemet led, 37-36, midway through the third, but the Warriors took control. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 12 Cerritos Valley Christian 79, Sun Valley Village Christian 64 -- Center 
Jodi Parriott scored a game-high 45 points to lead Valley Christian to the 
Division IV-A championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lady Crusaders (25-2) jumped to a 21-2 lead in the first quarter en route 
to their third consecutive section title. 
</P>
<P>
 Village Christian (25-2) could draw no closer than 10 points after that. Lindy 
James led Village Christian with 33 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Christian forward Cindy Dykstra fell, hit her head and briefly lost 
consciousness near the end of the game. She was taken to a nearby hospital as a 
precautionary measure.

THE BILLIKENS MAKE ST. LOUIS FORGET ALL ABOUT THE BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE GIBSON McCARTHY, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One week from Sunday, the scholastic college of cardinals known as the NCAA 
Men's Basketball Committee will send out little puffs of smoke from the 40th 
floor of the Kansas City Hyatt Regency and announce the pairings for the 56th 
NCAA Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the nation college basketball fans, pencils ready, will sit anxiously 
in front of their televisions and hope for a favorable seed, an easy 
first-round game or simply an invitation to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the ultimate playground rules for the ultimate playground game. Pick me, 
and I'll be your friend forever. Pick me, and my school will reap the rewards 
of national exposure and all the trimmings that come with it. A committee of 
nine is responsible for the pairings and for the selection of 34 at-large teams 
after the automatic qualifiers from 30 conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 And on that Sunday, down the road from Kansas City on Interstate 70, the city 
of St. Louis will be glued to CBS-TV to see how the Billikens of St. Louis 
University fare. 
</P>
<P>
 That there is NCAA Tournament consideration for St. Louis U. -- St. Louis Who? 
-- is remarkable, considering that two seasons ago the Billikens were 5-23, 
players quit at midseason and walk-ons were needed to fill out the roster. A 
player even walked off the court during a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Coach Charlie Spoonhour. Spoonhour has his Billikens 22-3 and 8-3 in the 
Great Midwest Conference. On Feb. 23, the Billikens finished their home 
schedule 15-0 with a thrilling 70-67 victory over Cincinnati. Last season, the 
Billikens were 12-17 with only one regular-season conference victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of St. Louis, still stinging from an embarrassing rebuke by the NFL 
on expansion, has embraced the Billikens in unprecedented fashion. Sellout 
crowds have been the norm since December, and attendance is averaging 13,008. 
Records have been broken four times this season at 64-year old St. Louis Arena, 
including the latest, 18,411, who saw the Billikens defeat Cincinnati. Not bad 
considering Athletic Director Debbie Yow once considered putting up curtains 
inside the arena to shield empty seats and improve the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 If the selection committee picks St. Louis for its first tournament appearance 
since 1957, the imaginations of Billikens fans will run wild. Because in 
Spoonhour, St. Louis has a coach who knows how to handle the pressure of big 
games and who won't be blinded by the bright lights of the NCAA Tournament. 
Five times Spoonhour took Southwest Missouri State to the tournament. Although 
he won only one game, a 65-60 upset of Clemson in 1987, his teams were 
competitive. Losses to Kansas and Nevada Las Vegas in 1987 and '88 were by four 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlie's had a lot to do with St. Louis' success this year," Cincinnati 
Coach Bob Huggins says. "He's got good players, but what Charlie does is teach 
good fundamentals. When guys are sound fundamentally you give them a chance to 
win, and he gives them a chance to win. Good coaches put guys in position where 
they can be successful. And Charlie also is a great communicator." 
</P>
<P>
 Other coaches in the Great Midwest, a conference in which St. Louis was once 
considered to be the doormat, agree that "Spoon" is the tool that turned the 
tide in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as dramatic a turnaround as there has been in Division I," Dayton Coach 
Jim O'Brien says. "He has basically the same team, but he's built their 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Spoonhour had completed his ninth season at Southwest Missouri State when Yow 
called in April 1992. He was 197-81, and those five NCAA Tournament 
appearances, including that upset of fourth-seeded Clemson, had put Spoonball 
on the map. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis was coming off a 5-23 season under Rich Grawer, its worst record 
since the 1982-83 season, Grawer's first. A local high school coach who spent 
one season as an assistant to Norm Stewart at Missouri, Grawer brought St. 
Louis back to respectability and isn't getting the credit he deserves for 
resurrecting the Billikens' program. He won 27 games in 1988-89 with Knicks 
forward Anthony Bonner and had three NIT appearances in 10 seasons -- including 
appearances in the championship game in 1989 and '90. 
</P>
<P>
 After the acrimonious 1991-92 season, Grawer and St. Louis parted. Within 
days, Spoonhour was hired. 
</P>
<P>
 Yow says Spoonhour, who was a perennial front-runner for openings from South 
Carolina to Kansas, was more than the leading candidate. "He was the choice, as 
far as I was concerned," Yow says. "And he was the choice because of his track 
record -- simple, proven achievement and excellence." 
</P>
<P>
 So how was this coach with the homespun charm and the aw-shucks demeanor able 
to turn around the Billikens so quickly? 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't, the kids did," Spoonhour says. "Coaches, Xs and O's, and all that 
stuff -- it's pretty much the same. You get kids who decide they're going to 
play together. And that they're going to sublimate a few of their individual 
goals for team goals, then all of a sudden you've got guys who like each other 
and clap their hands and have a pretty workmanlike attitude towards things, 
then you win." 
</P>
<P>
 The reality is the Billikens are a collection of 3-point shooters and scrappy 
defenders, with the tallest starter 6-8 Evan Pederson, a transfer from 
Northwestern. They also are much deeper team than last season's. Depth was a 
glaring weakness in Spoonhour's first season, and he was quick to address it. 
The bench averaged 9.1 points per game and 7.4 rebounds per game in '92-93. 
This season, it is averaging 20.3 points and 11.5 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Billikens are also better defensively. St. Louis usually employs an 
aggressive, man-to-man. Yet Spoonhour also is flexible enough to change the 
game plan, as he did in the closing moments of the Cincinnati victory when he 
changed to a 1-1-3 zone, and the Billikens were able to hold off the Bearcats 
twice in the game's last minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for this season, the foundation was actually laid in the Grawer era. Two 
of the top three 3-point threats are Erwin Claggett, a 6-1 junior from nearby 
Venice, Ill., and Scott Highmark, a 6-5 junior from suburban St. Louis, both 
recruited by Grawer. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season St. Louis finished last in the Great Midwest, and this season it 
was picked to finish sixth in the seven-team conference. Instead, the Billikens 
have been among the league leaders in a season in which: 
</P>
<P>
 They posted the best start in university history at 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
 For one week in early February, they were 19-1 and had the best winning 
percentage in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been ranked for the first time since the 1964-65 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to lie and say, yeah, I knew exactly that this was going to happen 
and we had this grand plan," Spoonhour says. "But we've never had a grand plan. 
I know that drives people crazy. The only thing we were trying to do was get 
better, and we didn't know how much better we could be." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis' game plan is simple. Play tenacious defense then go down court and 
get open for the 3-point shot. The Billikens are holding opponents to 70.5 
points per game and getting the ball to Claggett, Highmark or H. Waldman -- for 
the "H-bomb" as they're known when Waldman shoots them. Claggett leads the team 
with 71 three-pointers and should break the season record of 82. Highmark has 
61 and Waldman 46. Claggett's 3-point shot with 1 minute, 40 seconds remaining 
sealed the victory over Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 And when they get to the NCAA tournament, watch out for Spoonball. In 1989, 
for example, Spoonhour's Southwest Missouri State team gave Seton Hall -- which 
would end up in the national championship game -- its toughest test, losing by 
nine in the first round. The Pirates then rolled over Evansville, Indiana, UNLV 
and Duke by 14, 13, 23 and 27 until losing in overtime to Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Spoonhour plays it safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more difficult to get overlooked now," Spoonhour says. "It was difficult 
for some teams to prepare for (Southwest Missouri) because they knew very 
little about us and hadn't seen us. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year's team is a little different. Our team this year is more of an 
uptempo, score-a-lot-of-points (team). Where we'll still work hard and still 
play, I hope, some defense at times, our trademark this year is shooting. And I 
don't think we'll sneak up on anyone because we've received so much attention."

SANTA ANITA; MEGAN'S INTERCO WINS ARCADIA HANDICAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Megan's Interco, a gelding who once made a living running second, has changed 
his ways. 
</P>
<P>
 The Calfifornia-bred son of Interco made it five consecutive victories for 
owner Milt Bronson and trainer Jenine Sahadi, defeating Tinners Way by a head 
in the $109,400 Arcadia Handicap on the turf at Santa Anita on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Megan's Interco, the 8-5 favorite, was never far off the pace being set by 
Tinners Way, and they battled through the stretch. Ridden by Corey Black, 
Megan's Interco has now won four of five on the turf and six of his last seven 
overall. He completed the mile in 1:33 4/5. Earl Of Barking, the 2-1 second 
choice, was fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just one super racehorse," Black said. "I've told Jenine that if you 
take Lure out of it, I don't know if there's any horse who can beat this horse 
on grass at a mile." 
</P>
<P>
 In the race before the Arcadia, favored Mamselle Bebette won her third stakes 
of the meeting, beating Arches Of Gold by nearly two lengths in the $92,475 Las 
Flores Breeders' Cup Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by John Forsythe's Big Train Farm and trained by Jack Van Berg, Mamselle 
Bebette took over in the final eighth of a mile after Arches Of Gold had set 
the pace from her inside post. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Nakatani rode the 4-year-old Copelan filly, who earlier had won the La 
Brea on Dec. 28 and the Monrovia Handicap on Feb. 6. Mamselle Bebette ran the 
six furlongs in 1:08 1/5 and paid $5. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she's going to be a real top filly when we get done with her, if we 
can keep her sound," Van Berg said. "I don't know what we'll do next. We'll 
just give her some time and pick our way along."

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: BUS SHELTER CAN STILL BE TAX SHELTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q: I invested $10,000 in a bus shelter purchase and lease-back deal three 
years ago. I received lease payments in 1992 and reported them as income. I 
received seven payments in 1993 before the company became the target of a 
Securities and Exchange Commission investigation and ceased making payments. 
How do I handle the payments I received in 1993, and what do I do with the rest 
of my investment? -- J.V.L . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: For 1993, you should report the lease payments you received as income and 
continue depreciating the structure as you no doubt started to do. You may not, 
as you might want, consider the lease payments you have received to be a return 
of your initial capital, leaving you to write off the remaining un-reimbursed, 
undepreciated amount as an investment loss. 
</P>
<P>
 How can you write off your investment? Our experts say you must abandon it; 
that is, stop all efforts to lease or find advertising tenants for the bus 
shelter. Should you do so, you are entitled to write off only the undepreciated 
amount of the bus shelter's value. Loss Can Be Tax Gain in Sale of Real Estate 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I purchased a rental house several years ago that I now must sell at a 
substantial loss. How do I account for my losses on my income taxes? Is this 
loss treated like any other capital loss? -- D.A.M . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Losses on the sale of rental properties are not treated like other capital 
losses. For reasons probably best known to Congress and the real estate lobby, 
taxpayers with real estate investment losses are entitled to more generous 
write-offs. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the greatest is the taxpayer's ability to write real estate investment 
losses off against the full extent of ordinary income. If your losses exceed 
your annual income, you can carry the excess back three years, or forward one 
year to recoup the balance of the deduction against your ordinary income for 
the period. 
</P>
<P>
 Compare this to the rules governing, say, a loss in the stock market. That 
loss must be written off first against gains on similar investments. Any excess 
after that can be written off against $3,000 of ordinary income. The loss can 
be carried forward, but only at the rate of $3,000 a year. Appraising Your Home 
Retroactively 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My wife died two years ago. I did not know at the time that I should have 
gotten our home reappraised to its value as of her death to determine its 
stepped-up value. Is it too late? -- R.H . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: You are still entitled to establish the value of your community property 
assets as of your wife's date of death. Further, you should not have much 
difficulty determining the value of your home as of that date. The easiest way 
to do this is to ask a trusted real estate professional who specializes in your 
neighborhood for a list of sales of comparable properties around that time. Or 
you can search the files at the recorder's office for your county. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the above advice assumes that you filed the required estate-tax 
return following your wife's death. Normally, completing the return would have 
required you to set the value of your wife's assets in order to determine 
whether any estate taxes were due. Did you do this? If not, you face a 
potentially bigger problem than merely establishing the value of your home. In 
this case, see your attorney or accountant immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 If no estate taxes are due because your wife's assets were worth less than 
$600,000 as of her death, you should have little trouble filing a late return. 
However, if you do owe taxes, your situation is stickier and you will need some 
professional assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, as you know, the value of California real estate has declined -- 
markedly in some cases -- over the last two years. If your tax basis is reset 
at an amount higher than what you can currently sell your house for, you are 
not entitled to claim a loss on the sale. Any losses -- paper or otherwise -- 
are not deductible on the sale of a personal residence. See Line 3, Section 1, 
for Tax-Free Income 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Where on the tax form is tax-free income subtracted from taxable income? * 
</P>
<P>
 E.J.D . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: If your total interest or your total dividends received during the year 
exceeded $400, you must complete the relevant sections of Schedule B of the tax 
form. Part I deals with interest; Part II is for dividends. In these sections 
you are to list all your interest and dividend payments. But on Line 3 of Part 
I you list the tax-free interest for subtraction from the total. On Line 8 of 
Part II, you subtract your tax-free dividends. The results of these 
computations are entered on the appropriate lines of Form 1040. How to Withdraw 
From Your IRA 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I turned age 70 this year and must begin mandatory withdrawals from my IRA. 
I understand there are two acceptable methods for calculating the amount to be 
disbursed: "recalculation" and "term certain." Which is easier? I don't want to 
saddle my beneficiary, my sister, with an extra burden. If I use the 
term-certain method, how much will I have to take each year? -- E.B . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: The term-certain method is easier since it does not entail a recalculation 
of the amount to be taken every year. According to the IRS, you can use the 
"single life expectancy" system for determining the minimum withdrawal you 
would have to make each year under the term-certain method. According to unisex 
life expectancy tables used by the IRS, a 70-year-old taxpayer would be 
required to take a minimum IRA distribution equal to one-sixteenth of the 
account every year.

POLICE SUICIDES RISE AS HIDDEN EPIDEMIC SWEEPS THE COUNTRY; LAW ENFORCEMENT: 
SPECIALISTS SAY THAT OFFICERS TAKE THEIR OWN LIVES AT A RATE AT LEAST DOUBLE 
THAT OF THE GENERAL POPULATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULES LOH, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The man didn't show up for work so Cindy Goss phoned his home. No answer. She 
jumped in her car and rushed to his house. He was there, a bottle and a glass 
at his side. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trust me," she said to him. "You must trust me now." 
</P>
<P>
 Her heart pounding, she slid her finger between the trigger and the trigger 
guard and eased the muzzle of the gun from his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Goss is one of America's more successful battlers against what one 
forensic psychologist calls a hidden epidemic: police suicides. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hidden because suicides tend to be hushed up, in part out of reluctance 
by police authorities to admit they may be work-related. And, although 
"epidemic" may not be quite apt -- there is nothing contagious about suicide -- 
there does appear to police psychologists to be an undeniable increase lately 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In America, about 16 of every 100,000 adults commit suicide annually. At least 
that is the figure generally accepted among psychologists studying the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 In the New York City police force of 30,000, the nation's largest, at least 63 
officers have committed suicide in the last 10 years. That's 31% higher than 
the average. Last year's eight suicides were nearly double the average. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Jacksonville, Fla., force of 1,200, tiny by comparison, four suicides 
in the last two years is 10 times the general rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any tie directly to the job," said Jacksonville's director, W. C. 
Brown. Neither did New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly. All eight 
suicides on his force, he said, stemmed from "domestic problems," not police 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no government statistics on the suicide rate of police officers, but 
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration reports that police officers 
have a life span eight to 11 years shorter than the average. Specialists who 
study police suicide say the rate on a national scale is at least double that 
of the general population and possibly higher. 
</P>
<P>
 You could not persuade Cindy Goss that the reason has nothing to do with the 
emotionally draining work. Police, incidentally, refer to their work as The 
Job, as if no other fits the definition. 
</P>
<P>
 Goss is a certified counselor for drug and alcohol abuse. She went to work 
with the employee assistance program for New York's Erie County and met with 
success in every county office except one. "In the Sheriff's Department," she 
said, "nothing seemed to work." She set about discovering why. 
</P>
<P>
 What she discovered about The Job others in the field have discovered as well. 
To oversimplify, the progression from idealistic police academy graduate to 
depressed cop with his gun in his mouth goes like this: 
</P>
<P>
 Graduate frequently exposed to blood, gore and danger. Does not unburden these 
horrors on spouse. Spouse wouldn't understand. A few drinks with the guys after 
work helps to unwind. Fellow cops understand. Can't trust civilians. Can't 
admit troubles even to fellow cops; would be considered a wimp. Can't trust 
fellow cops. Drinking increases. Spouse takes off. Gun is handy. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun Cindy Goss removed from that officer's mouth was only one of five 
similar rescues she has made in as many years. All five men are back at work. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no telling, of course, how many lives the program she devised five 
years ago might have saved. But the decrease in absenteeism, sick leave, 
turnover, tardiness and other measures of departmental performance are so 
marked that the program has become mandatory in every police agency in Erie and 
some other New York counties and has leaped the border into Canada. No agency 
to adopt it has recorded a suicide since. More obvious, say colleagues, are the 
hundreds of careers, even marriages, saved long before the progression reaches 
the gun-in-mouth stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cops are well screened before they sign on," said Harley Stock. "Most have a 
mentality more like a social worker than a soldier. Over time and in 
increments, they don't recognize their personality gets chipped away and 
changes." 
</P>
<P>
 Stock, among other specialties, is a screener. He knows the progression well, 
both from textbooks and experience. 
</P>
<P>
 He has earned a handful of degrees, including a doctorate in police 
psychology, a narrow but expanding specialty. He's a certified SWAT team member 
and hostage negotiator. He worked with two dozen police agencies in Michigan 
and was police psychologist in Broward County (Ft. Lauderdale), Fla. He now has 
his own treatment center, "Interphase 911" in Boca Raton, exclusively for 
police officers and entirely confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically," he said, "the cop who commits suicide is a male, white, 35, 
working patrol, abusing alcohol, separated or seeking a divorce, experiencing a 
recent loss or disappointment. Typically, a domestic dispute is involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cops are controlling individuals. When a cop loses control in his own home he 
can't handle it. For 24 to 36 hours he is acutely suicidal. He barricades 
himself in his house and makes all kinds of threats. If he can get beyond that 
point he gets himself back together very quickly. You don't see that in the 
general population." 
</P>
<P>
 "Also," said Stock, "about 90% of the time the cop is drinking heavily when he 
shoots himself." (That was the case in all five of the men Cindy Goss took the 
guns from.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's a statistic with lots of supporting data to back it up," Stock 
continued. "About 10% of the general population who drink become alcoholics. 
Among cops the figure is 23%. Cops also abuse drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "And here's another solid statistic: The suicide rate among alcoholics in the 
general population is 270 per 100,000" -- far above the 16 per 100,000 in the 
general population. 
</P>
<P>
 Among cops, after-shift drinking bouts are so endemic to The Job that they 
have a universal euphemism for it: choir practice. If the pitfalls of choir 
practice aren't obvious, Stock explains: 
</P>
<P>
 "Alcohol at first releases tension, but if you drink enough it becomes a 
depressant. So if you have an underlying depression, it makes it worse. The 
suicide rate among people suffering from depression is 230 per 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have, then, is a psychologically panicking cop full of alcohol, 
depressed, with access to a weapon. Bad combination. Bad combination." 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent study of 20 suicides in one large Midwest police department, 13 of 
the victims were alcohol abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Wambaugh, the writer, has long studied the progression from idealism to 
despair. Wambaugh was a Los Angeles police officer for 17 years. His books, 
fiction and nonfiction, are as much about how police do their jobs as what The 
Job does to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cops, of course, see the worst of people, but they expect that when they sign 
on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they don't expect -- and nothing can prepare them for it -- is to see 
ordinary people at their worst. This works on their sense of belief, I would 
say, and they tend to become prematurely cynical. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even people who come from war can rationalize it by telling themselves that 
that was war and in war people become savage barbarians. But this is not war 
and people are normal and good. And here he is in the middle of the night in a 
normal person's home seeing normal people at their absolute worst. He begins 
believing that all people are barbarians and savages. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had young cops confess to me in a patrol car at night that when they go 
to the grocery store they wonder who the grocer is ripping off, whether he will 
try to cheat them. When they go to church, they wonder what the preacher does 
when nobody's around. That's pretty cynical. 
</P>
<P>
 "An old saying among cops is that everybody is garbage except my partner and 
me and I'm not sure about him. When he begins to include himself, the erosion 
of self-esteem is complete, the cynicism is complete." 
</P>
<P>
 Wambaugh, Stock, Goss and others all seem to recognize these same steps toward 
depression and use the same phrases to describe other traits of The Job. 
</P>
<P>
 The John Wayne syndrome, for example. This is the cultivated swagger of 
authority -- and its corollary, the macho refusal to admit a weakness or ask 
for help. "Eventually," Wambaugh said, "the badge becomes almost heavier than 
he can carry." 
</P>
<P>
 There's also the Minority Group syndrome: The embattled minority in blue 
refusing to associate with outsiders (who can't be trusted) but only with 
fellow cops. 
</P>
<P>
 And another phenomenon of recent years: 
</P>
<P>
 "There used to be limits," said Stock. "Even the worst criminal, unless pushed 
to the wall, would not shoot a cop because he knew it would be all over for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now they ambush cops. The cop has to wonder whether a man-with-a-gun call is 
real or a setup. We had a case in Florida recently of two teen-agers shooting a 
cop in the head and riding away on bicycles. When a cop stops a car with an 
expired license, he has to wonder whether a guy with an Uzi is sitting behind 
the tinted glass." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently in Buffalo, N.Y., someone drove by a precinct house and sprayed the 
building and the cruisers out front with automatic rifle fire. The cops assumed 
it was someone "sending them a message." 
</P>
<P>
 Police work is not the most dangerous occupation. Statistically, firefighters, 
roofers, miners and others have more hazardous jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "But with police officers it is the anticipation of danger that causes the 
stress," said Lt. Timothy Tate. "The stress never ends and it is overwhelming. 
Every cop in this area knows about the Buffalo shooting. A cop may not get a 
call his entire shift, but he drives around for eight hours with that 
knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 Tate is a 15-year police veteran in East Aurora, a suburb of Buffalo. Before 
that, he was a cop in Tampa, Fla. Like countless others, his career was 
interrupted by the way he chose to deal with that overwhelming stress. "I came 
to a point where alcohol was destroying my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Tate, who is completing a doctoral dissertation at Syracuse University on 
police stress, supervises the Law Enforcement Peer Support Group in Erie 
County. Stress. Peer counseling -- cops helping cops -- is a key element in the 
Cindy Goss program and every other successful rescue and rehabilitation effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a supervisor," said the lieutenant, "I also recognize a very practical 
reason apart from the obvious humane ones to keep a cop from falling by the 
wayside. It's cost-effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "It costs $50,000 and up and about five years' experience to put a productive 
cop on the road. Full-blown treatment costs $10,000 or less. Doesn't it make 
sense to save the trained cop rather than replace him with another $50,000 
rookie? 
</P>
<P>
 "The new federal proposal to combat the increase in crime and violence would 
provide money to put more cops on the street. That's great. But wouldn't it be 
more productive to address the stress problems of cops already on the street 
and keep them on the job? Otherwise, I'm not sure hiring new guys and training 
them will even keep up with our current attrition rate." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Tate and the other peer counselors, all volunteers, are doing, and 
with commendable success. They are trained to catch the signals from their 
fellow cops that, being cops themselves, they recognize all too well. They are 
as aware as novelist Wambaugh, former cop, of what could happen if the telltale 
signals are missed: 
</P>
<P>
 "When you put that blue steel crucifix against the roof of your mouth and 
squeeze, nobody walks away."

PATRON SAINT OF RAGPICKERS FIGHTS FOR HOMELESS; FRANCE: ABBE PIERRE, AN 
81-YEAR-OLD FORMER MONK, GETS FIENDISH DELIGHT OUT OF CONFRONTING STATUS-QUO 
POLITICIANS WITH HIS 'HOLY ANGER.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE GANLEY, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His real name is Henry Groues, but nobody knows it. Street people call the 
most popular man in France the Ragpickers' Saint, and he is known best by a 
wartime code name that stuck: Abbe Pierre. 
</P>
<P>
 No ethereal holy man, this bearded old priest with cloak and cane. No everyday 
mortal, either. Abbe Pierre is a combatant with a mission to wipe out misery, 
and is a fly in the ointment of those who cherish the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 A former monk, Resistance hero and legislator, founder of the international 
Emmaus Community for the poor, Abbe Pierre is, above all, the patron saint of 
France's estimated half a million homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 At 81, he consistently leads polls as the nation's best-loved public figure. 
He has a devilish glint in his deep-set eyes and politicians beware when a 
"holy anger" is coming on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not by temperament a man of anger," Abbe Pierre said in his room at a 
rest home for elderly Emmaus workers in this Normandy village. "But when I must 
denounce something that destroys man, I get mad. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is love that engenders this holy anger. They are inseparable." 
</P>
<P>
 A finely chiseled face awash in gentleness but spiced with a piercing regard 
bespeaks the contradictions of a priest in permanent revolt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Indignation" is the word he prefers. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty years ago, this indignation welled up when, as Parliament rejected funds 
for postwar emergency housing, a 3-month-old infant froze to death in a bus its 
family called home. Days later, a woman died on a Paris boulevard, an eviction 
order clutched in her frozen hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbe Pierre transformed his indignation into a radio appeal on behalf of the 
homeless. In minutes, he moved a nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of francs poured in. A hotel, railway station and army trucks were 
commandeered to collect the 300 tons of donated supplies, which included jewels 
and fur coats. Charlie Chaplin handed over an envelope containing 2 million 
francs that, he said, "belonged to the vagabond that I was." 
</P>
<P>
 On the 40th anniversary of that appeal, still indignant, Abbe Pierre renewed 
his call to action. "My friends, wake up," he said on the same radio station in 
early February. "This is war, the war of defense against misery." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Abbe Pierre's face peers out from newspapers, magazines and posters, 
and his frail but sure voice resounds over radio and television as France pays 
homage to its moral spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The national daily Liberation described him as "practically a national 
monument." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the accolades, the man remains humble. But humility does not prevent 
him from adroitly using his moral authority to serve his cause. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, Abbe Pierre stared down riot police for more than three hours, 
trying to salvage a home for 20 squatter families who had been evicted. He won 
a meeting with Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, and concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, he refused to accept the coveted Legion of Honor until 
authorities agreed to establish a High Committee for Housing. 
</P>
<P>
 For Abbe Pierre, such gestures are human, not heroic. To understand the plight 
of the homeless, he explained, "one has only to say, 'Monsieur, put yourself in 
their shoes.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He does not believe in a classless society -- "The janitor at Citroen is not 
jealous of the boss," he contends -- but thinks future generations are 
"condemned to share" the wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbe Pierre, born into a wealthy Lyon family, lives simply in a small room 
furnished with a bed and a large table. 
</P>
<P>
 The table and several crude shelves are such a jumble of papers, books, 
photographs and other evidence of his long struggle that the walls, painted by 
other residents in Abbe Pierre's favorite blue and yellow, are hardly visible. 
</P>
<P>
 Downstairs, 35 other residents of the rest home stitch patchwork into blankets 
for the needy or match the thousands of old buttons collected for resale to 
raise money for Emmaus, which helps the poor help themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "In modern times, we have never seen a belligerent in a war say, 'I'm stopping 
because it costs too much money,' " he said, his indignation beginning to show. 
"Misery is attacking us. We have to put ourselves in a war mode." 
</P>
<P>
 Born Henry Groues, one of eight children of a wealthy banker, he exchanged 
comfort for a monk's cell for six years, then became a priest. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined the Resistance in World War II, taking the name Abbe Pierre as a 
cover while he manufactured fake identity papers and helped Jews cross into 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 His devotion to the "street sleepers" was awakened when he was elected to 
Parliament after the war. An eclectic deputy for seven years, until 1951, he 
occasionally begged alms while organizing homeless ragpickers so they could 
fend for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of an ex-convict and his own legislative salary, the first 
Emmaus Community house was born in 1949 in Neuilly-Plaisance, northeast of 
Paris. Emmaus is now in 37 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like everything in my life, nothing is the result of a choice," Abbe Pierre 
said modestly. "Life is always more consent than choice . . . consenting to the 
circumstances at hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Age and infirmities have not persuaded the abbe to slow down. He visited an 
Emmaus Community in Uruguay in February, answers letters from desperate souls 
and lobbies politicians regularly.

NEW YORK ACCUSED OF RACISM ON INCINERATOR SITE; ALBANY: BLACKS WERE TOLD THE 
PLANT POSED NO HAZARD. BLACKENED SNOW AT GOVERNOR'S MANSION BROUGHT ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NEKESA MUMBI MOODY, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the last 12 years, officials have assured residents of a predominantly 
black neighborhood in Albany's inner city that a trash-burning incinerator was 
no health threat. 
</P>
<P>
 But less than three weeks after the incinerator's emissions blackened the snow 
at the nearby governor's mansion, the incinerator was shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 For Emily Grisom and others, the garbage-burning incinerator had been a 
longstanding irritant and an example of environmental racism. 
</P>
<P>
 Grisom has lived on the same block as the state-owned incinerator since it 
began burning trash in 1981. In the summer, she has had to close her windows 
because of the stench of burning garbage. And, on certain days at certain 
times, she said she and her neighbors suffered from stuffed-up noses. 
</P>
<P>
 Grisom said she knows at least 10 neighborhood children who suffer from 
asthma, and she links their problems to the incinerator. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . (But) no one's looking at that," she said. "They have not bothered, 
because this area is 99% black. They have never bothered. If it was in a white 
community, five or 10 kids, they would say, 'That's outrageous.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Until Jan. 29, the day it closed, the plant burned approximately 350 tons of 
waste each day -- sending arsenic, lead, mercury and other pollutants into the 
air. It also provided steam to heat and cool the nearby offices of Gov. Mario 
Cuomo and state legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 Although state officials had said they were sure the incinerator -- dubbed the 
"ANSWERS" plant -- was not harming residents, they had concluded it was 
outdated. They said it would have been very costly to bring it up to the 
standards of newer plants. State officials had planned to close it in two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 But a malfunction at the plant Jan. 10 caused a shower of unburned oil 
particles to darken the snow-covered ground in downtown Albany, including the 
governor's mansion. The incident hastened the incinerator's shutdown date. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said an overloaded boiler allowed the soot to be released into 
the air in a fine mist. The mishap further outraged residents and 
environmentalists and added a new sense of urgency to the call to shut down the 
incinerator. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the shutdown of the garbage-burning operation didn't come soon 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was in any other neighborhood in Albany, it would have been shut down 
years ago," said Judy Enck, senior environmental associate at the New York 
Public Interest Research Group (NYPIRG) in Albany. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is unheard of, having this (the incinerator) right in a neighborhood," 
she said. "They're usually isolated, in more commercial areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Enck charged that the plant was another example of "environmental racism" -- a 
phrase that has become increasingly widespread as environmentalists focus 
attention on the disproportionate number of minority areas affected by 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's absurd, absolutely absurd. I can't think of any conscionable person 
suggesting that," countered Thom Tubbs, a spokesman for the Office of General 
Services, which operates the plant. The proximity to downtown government 
buildings, Tubbs says, was the key factor in the location of the incinerator. 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWERS, an acronym for the Albany New York Solid Waste Energy Recovery 
System, is probably the most modern-looking and perhaps best-kept building on 
its block. The block, with a few dilapidated houses and small businesses, is 
similar to many in Arbor Hill, a densely populated, economically depressed 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally a steam plant that burned natural gas, an incinerator was added by 
the state as part of a city-state waste disposal system. The energy the 
incinerator produced by burning garbage provided heat for many government 
buildings downtown, including the massive Empire State Plaza office, museum and 
convention complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the incinerator has been shut down, the plant is relying again on 
natural gas to provide steam to the state buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Enck contended that the incinerator's daily emissions exceeded the state's own 
pollution standards. Gary Strier, assistant commissioner of the state 
Department of Environmental Conservation, denied that. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1991 study by the federal Environmental Protection Agency concluded that 
most hazardous waste sites are in minority neighborhoods or in white, poor 
rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fairness issue. It's unfair that these communities bear a 
disproportionate risk burden simply because of their race or economic 
background," said Robert Knox, deputy director of the EPA's Office of 
Environmental Equity in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 NYPIRG and community organizations had fought to have ANSWERS shut down for 
almost as long as it has been in service. Some people left the neighborhood 
rather than wait to see when the plant would close. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of dozen (residents) have moved out of the area because they had 
health problems, like asthma, respiratory problems . . . ," said Enck. She had 
even suggested to residents that they move for their own well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she had asked the state Department of Health and the Albany County 
Health Department to conduct studies on how the plant affected residents' 
health, but they refused. 
</P>
<P>
 John Hawley, research director of the state Department of Health's division of 
environmental health assessment, said that although the department had received 
complaints from residents, no study was conducted to determine the plant's 
effect on them. A study of the plant's effect on its employees found that they 
were in no danger, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Strier said that DEC's original decision to close the incinerator did not mean 
the department no longer supports incinerators. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of months before the incinerator closed, Grisom, who had heard of 
plans to shut down ANSWERS several times in the last decade, wasn't so sure she 
would see its end.

BRAZILIAN ARMY WAITS IN WINGS AS GOVERNMENT TRIES TO CLEAN UP ITS ACT; 
POLITICS: THOUGH TALK OF A COUP IS DISMISSED, MILITARY LEADERS DEMAND THAT THE 
COUNTRY'S CORRUPTION AND ECONOMIC WOES BE ADDRESSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When a leftist legislator found evidence of a scandal that could shake 
Brazil's young democracy to its foundations, he went straight to the army 
minister, bypassing the president and even his own party. 
</P>
<P>
 The scandal had nothing to do with the armed forces, but Rep. Aloizio 
Mercadante knew an old truth about Brazil: For action in a crisis, the military 
is the place to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Zenildo Lucena encouraged Mercadante to investigate. He also told him the 
army wanted a political housecleaning, fast, and that Congress should purge 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, Benedito Onofre Bezerra Leonel, army chief of staff, said in 
a speech: "Beware the anger of the legions. In moments of turbulence, military 
leaders have always proven to be true leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 Since relinquishing power in 1985 after 21 years of rule, military commanders 
have extolled the constitution and dismissed rumors of an impending coup. The 
latest comments, however, represent an unusually open attempt to influence 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are warning lights of an institutional crisis," said Geraldo Cavagnari, 
a retired colonel who heads the Nucleus for Strategic Studies, a military think 
tank. 
</P>
<P>
 "The armed forces are giving the civilian institutions a free hand to respond 
to these corruption crises. But if they ever fail, the conditions will be ripe 
for a takeover." 
</P>
<P>
 Still other rumblings can be heard in the 325,000-member Brazilian military as 
it wrestles with its own identity crisis, searching for a mission in a world 
without a Cold War, under a government with no money. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp cuts in defense spending and low pay have fed support among the middle 
ranks of officers for a military-backed coup of the sort carried out by Alberto 
Fujimori, the Peruvian president, in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an uprising was proposed in October after Rep. Mercadante discovered 18 
boxes of documents at the home of chief of the Odebrecht construction firm, one 
of Brazil's biggest. The documents contained the names of lawmakers who 
channeled public projects to builders for kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 President Itamar Franco rejected the idea, but military analysts say a serious 
risk remains if Congress does not expel corrupt members and put the country's 
finances in order. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 17, a congressional investigating committee recommended the expulsions 
of 17 deputies and a senator for corruption. Votes by the full Chamber of 
Deputies and Senate are expected in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation of 2,500% a year and soaring unemployment have made many Brazilians 
openly nostalgic for military rule, when economic conditions were much better. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half the respondents in opinion polls say Brazil would be better off 
without Congress. Many residents of Rio speak fondly of the two-week Earth 
Summit in 1992 not for ecological reasons, but because many soldiers patrolling 
the streets provided a respite from crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Low pay has become a serious problem for the military and the generals are 
pressing Franco to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 A four-star general gets about $30,000 a year after 25 years of service. 
Recruits are paid barely $80 a month. Congressmen receive more than $80,000 
annually, and most have high absentee rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior officers moonlight as plumbers, auto mechanics and taxi drivers. Their 
wives can be seen peddling chewing gum, popcorn or beverages outside movie 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Although soldiers have never been paid generously, their fortunes began to 
decline in 1990 when Fernando Collor de Mello, the first directly elected 
civilian president since military rule, pledged to demilitarize Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 He slashed annual military spending to $2 billion, or 0.5% of the gross 
national product, about one-sixth the level during army rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Military leaders say Brazil spends $13 per capita on the armed forces. 
Argentina and Chile, two other nations ruled by the military not long ago, 
spend spend $35 and $55, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 So tight is the army's budget that it no longer provides each soldier with two 
uniforms. Recruits are sent home on weekends to save money. They train with 
blanks and BB guns. In maneuvers, some units simulate attacks without weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Paratroopers simulate air invasions by leaping from vans -- jokingly called 
"vancopters" -- instead of helicopters. The division that guards Brazil's 
border with Colombia hasn't eaten meat in six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine commanders and sailors spent only three weeks at sea last year. Pilots 
train with 20-year-old F-5 jets and in a year fly no more than 50 hours, the 
average monthly flight time for a U.S. pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso announced a further 40% 
cut in defense spending as part of an effort to balance the federal budget and 
control inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 During his speech in December, Gen. Leonel called Cardoso an "irresponsible, 
crafty man with a disrespect for our moral values." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward, President Franco ordered Cardoso to spare the military. 
Such costly projects as the $40-million nuclear submarine program, a rocket 
development program and maneuvers in the Amazon jungle were left intact.

<P>
 Threats posed by pollution, oil spills, overfishing and more than a million 
tourists a year furrow the brows of scientists and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Protected as the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park since 1975, the reef 
encompasses about 135,000 square miles, an area larger than Great Britain. It 
is a feature so grand that it can be seen from orbiting spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest system of coral and associated plants and animals in the world, 
the Great Barrier Reef is actually a 1,250-mile-long complex of 2,900 separate 
reefs off the northeast Australian coast. The reef's turquoise waters shelter 
1,500 species of fish, 400 types of coral and 4,000 species of mollusks. 
</P>
<P>
 With so much at stake, reef experts have become increasingly uneasy in the 
last few years as some coastal waters off Australia's Queensland state have 
become murkier. Water quality in the park is described as "a critical 
management issue." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent study indicates that runoff from Queensland's rivers washes 16.5 
million tons of sediment into the Coral Sea each year. Mixed with this runoff 
are nearly 85,000 tons of nitrogen and 11,000 tons of phosphorous, much of it 
from fertilizers used on farms. 
</P>
<P>
 In adverse wind and tidal conditions, river runoff can carry harmful chemicals 
125 miles offshore. In the sea, nitrogen and phosphorous enhance the growth of 
algae known as phytoplankton. 
</P>
<P>
 The green glop blocks the sunlight that nurtures coral and other reef 
creatures. "Phosphorous actually damages the coral's skeleton, making it weaker 
and more prone to damage from storms," said Jon Brodie, director of research 
for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists from several Australian organizations have joined a four-year study 
to learn precisely where the nutrients are coming from, how they reach 
different parts of the reef and how they interact in various reef environments. 
</P>
<P>
 More ominous than algae, however, is the constant threat of oil spills. About 
2,000 ships, 200 of them tankers, pass close to the Great Barrier Reef each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Freighters, too, carry oil or oil products. Big bauxite and coal ships 
sometimes carry 2,000 to 3,000 tons of fuel oil. So when any vessel collides or 
runs aground, there is the possibility of an oil spill, from minor to 
catastrophic. Deliberate pumping of waste oil directly into the ocean causes 
many small spills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's impossible for a single event to wipe out the entire reef system, but a 
40,000-ton spill similar to the Exxon Valdez could wipe out a significant chunk 
of it," said the park authority's reef-monitoring expert, Steve Raaymakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a worst-case scenario, we're talking about oiling 125 to 185 miles of 
coastline, 50 reefs and about 50 islands -- roughly 10% of the total reef 
area." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the ballast water carried aboard foreign ships worries Wendy Craik, the 
park authority executive officer. This water is often expelled after the 
vessels reach Australian ports. "All you need is one nasty organism released 
with that water, and the effects on our coral could be irreversible," Craik 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists also are evaluating the effect that hordes of tourists have on the 
reef. Huge, sleek, aluminum-hulled catamarans slice through the waves every 
day, chockablock with goggle-eyed visitors eager to try out their first snorkel 
and fins. 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, some of the snorkelers break delicate coral formations. Their 
sheer numbers cloud the waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchors and chains dropped by commercial trawlers and weekend sailors take a 
further toll on coral. Heavy nets dragged over the bottom rake wide areas. John 
Robertson, who monitors fishing for the park authority, expresses "a major 
concern that trolling is modifying the sea bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 The heavy fishing also seems to be affecting various species on the reef. 
Commercial operators go after easily marketable catches such as prawns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rest that turns up in the nets goes over the side as dead matter, which 
attracts big, predatory fish such as sharks," said Robertson. These carnivorous 
marauders seem to be taking over some areas once dominated by herbivorous fish. 
</P>
<P>
 As if all that weren't enough to worry about, the crown-of-thorns starfish 
seems to be acting up again. 
</P>
<P>
 A starfish outbreak in the late 1970s devastated large portions of the reef, 
then suddenly subsided. But now the park's starfish authority, Brian Lassig, is 
getting reports of growing numbers of crown of thorns near the resort center of 
Cairns, where the last infestation started. 
</P>
<P>
 A notorious glutton, the spine-covered menace dines on coral. In a single day 
it can graze an area twice the diameter of its body. 
</P>
<P>
 A predilection for fast food seems to be the predator's one redeeming feature. 
It seems to prefer coral that can regrow in about 15 years.

CANADA DEBATES BUILDING ROAD TO ARCTIC COAST; NORTHWEST TERRITORIES: LINK WOULD 
OPEN A HUGE AREA TO DEVELOPMENT, WHICH COULD THREATEN ENVIRONMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY ULBRICH, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This vast, harsh territory covering one-third of Canada is Ottawa's poor 
relation: isolated, underpopulated and living on federal handouts. 
</P>
<P>
 There are riches here -- gold, diamonds, copper, lead, silver and zinc -- but 
temperatures of minus 40 degrees or worse, 10 months of winter and dependence 
on air transport for moving goods make mining difficult and costly. 
</P>
<P>
 Nellie Cournoyea and her territorial government want to change all that by 
slashing a 550-mile road across the central Arctic from Yellowknife to the 
coast at Coronation Gulf. That would open a huge new area for development, but 
it also would raise environmental questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a clear realization that jobs and the economy are priority No. 1 in 
the 1990s," said John Todd, the territorial minister of nearly everything, 
including transportation, economic development and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northwest Territories has only 58,000 people, most of them Indians, in 1.3 
million square miles. Unemployment is estimated at more than 16%, compared to 
11.2% nationally. Half of the jobs that exist are in government and most of the 
budget comes from Ottawa, the federal capital. 
</P>
<P>
 One gold mine is operating in the region between Yellowknife and the sea, 
another is ready to resume production, a base metals project is on the verge of 
starting up and at least one diamond mine may open in the next few years. That 
could mean a bright future, and an all-weather road probably would attract more 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 "The advantage of a permanent road is that it could encourage other 
companies," said George Patterson, the territory's director of mineral policy. 
"But it's only an option. It's being studied because of the number of mines 
that could come into production." 
</P>
<P>
 The price tag: $450 million, plus another $37.5 million for a port near 
Coppermine on the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 And a second price tag: The environmental cost of cutting a road that will be 
heavily traveled through a pristine wilderness called the Barrens, the home of 
the musk ox, caribou and grizzly bear. That cost remains unknown, 
environmentalists say, but some believe nature can accommodate development. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an all-weather road from Yellowknife clear to Edmonton, and if you go 
a kilometer off that road you are in the wilderness," said David Livingstone, 
director of renewable resources and the environment for the federal Department 
of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. 
</P>
<P>
 "I agree that road access opens up a whole new scale of impacts, but I still 
think that, with careful management, we can have both." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are real dangers for the great wilderness, most of it north of 
the tree line. It is a rocky tundra dotted with lakes, where polar bears, 
Arctic foxes, wolves and wolverines also roam. 
</P>
<P>
 "The road will change the face of that country," said Steven Matthews, a 
wildlife biologist for the territorial Department of Renewable Resources. "The 
No. 1 issue is the grizzly, because . . . they require large tracts of 
undisturbed land." 
</P>
<P>
 Other issues include the impact on migration of the Bathurst caribou herd, 
Canada's largest, and the effect of icebreaking for the Coppermine port on 
inter-island migrations of Peary caribou. 
</P>
<P>
 Cournoyea is trying to sell the road project to Ottawa as a moneymaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt that opening access to the region will stimulate further 
exploration and development work," she said in her pitch last year. 
</P>
<P>
 She estimated the net increase in the Canadian gross domestic product from new 
mines at $13.5 billion, new employment at more than 210,000 person-years, new 
income taxes at $1.2 billion and exports at $11.25 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, from her standpoint, much of that new money would remain in the 
north. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lupin gold mine 280 miles north of here regularly builds and maintains a 
winter road from Yellowknife at its own expense. This "ice road" across the 
frozen lakes and tundra is open about two months and is used to bring in a 
year's worth of supplies. Other companies pay tonnage fees to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 Metall Mining Corp. is finishing a feasibility study for a base metals mine at 
Izok Lake, 210 miles from the coast. The company needs a road to Coppermine and 
a port. 
</P>
<P>
 Territorial officials fear that, if Metall Mining builds a road only from Izok 
Lake to the coast, all the benefits will be exported, leaving Yellowknife and 
the rest of the territory with nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the the federal government's reaction to Cournoyea's road proposal 
has been cool, territorial legislator Michael Ballantyne said: "There is no 
spare change around anymore. It will probably have to be a combination of 
public and private participation." 
</P>
<P>
 Once a road is built across the Barrens, people will use it -- not only mining 
companies, but tourists, hunters and fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, that raises another fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they should build it," said Jonas Sangris, chief of the 
Yellowknife Dene Band, one of many Indian groups struggling for self-government 
on traditional lands. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to be too many people up there."

HOLLAND GETS READY FOR THE VIDEO VERDICT 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Suspects soon won't even have to leave their prison cells to find out whether 
they're judged guilty or innocent if the Dutch Justice Ministry gets its way. 
</P>
<P>
 In a year, the ministry plans to inaugurate a computerized video link between 
courtrooms and prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 "This won't be for longer hearings," ministry spokesman Victor Holtus said 
Friday. "Perhaps for the opening of a trial, a verdict or a detention renewal." 
</P>
<P>
 Ministry officials believe the measure will save enormous amounts of money in 
security and the transportation of prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each year there are 30,000 trips from prisons to courts. It costs a lot of 
money," Holtus said. "Not only will we save, it'll also reduce the chance of 
escape."

BATTLE MAYORAL IN NEW ORLEANS GOES TO VOTERS; ELECTION: POLLS SHOW MARC MORIAL, 
SON OF CITY'S FIRST BLACK MAYOR, AND DONALD MINTZ, LAWYER WHO LOST 1990 RUNOFF, 
IN A DEAD HEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A nasty mayoral campaign dominated by scurrilous campaign flyers culminated 
Saturday with voters choosing between the son of the city's first black mayor 
and a lawyer who lost a 1990 runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls showed state Sen. Marc Morial, the son of former mayor Ernest (Dutch) 
Morial, and Donald Mintz in a dead heat or Morial with a slight lead. But the 
polls indicated that at least a fifth of the voters were undecided going into 
the last week of campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner will succeed Sidney Barthelemy, who was ineligible to run after two 
terms. Both candidates are Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 The new mayor will inherit recurring budget woes; the prospect of dealing with 
the world's largest gambling casino, expected to open in the next year or two; 
and a record murder rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Morial, 37, was one of two former mayor's sons in the race. State Rep. Mitch 
Landrieu, son of the city's last white mayor, Moon Landrieu, ran third in the 
primary behind Morial and the 51-year-old Mintz. 
</P>
<P>
 As the race began late last year with 10 candidates, polls showed crime and 
dissatisfaction with a patronage-laden City Hall to be the key issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Then flyers aimed at almost all of the candidates began appearing on 
doorsteps. 
</P>
<P>
 One flyer alleged back-room deals between Morial and Landrieu and questioned 
Morial's sexual orientation. Others were peppered with swastikas and racist and 
anti-Semitic remarks later described by an investigative committee as 
"ghastly." 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 4, a day before the primary in which all candidates compete regardless 
of party affiliation, a grand jury indicted an unpaid Mintz adviser, Napoleon 
Moses, on a misdemeanor charge of distributing anonymous -- and therefore 
illegal -- campaign flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mintz said he knew nothing about the flyers but dismissed Moses. Morial blamed 
Mintz's camp. In turn, Mintz's campaign accused Morial of planting spies and 
using publicity from the investigation into the flyers as a dirty campaign 
tactic.

28 HARDY SOULS VOLUNTEER TO SPEND WINTER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WORLD; SOUTH 
POLE: THE CREW OF SCIENTISTS, METEOROLOGISTS AND OTHERS CANNOT LEAVE ANTARCTICA 
FOR THE NEXT EIGHT MONTHS. THEY WILL LIVE IN AN UNHEATED GEODESIC DOME; 
OUTSIDE, TEMPERATURES CAN REACH 100 BELOW ZERO. 
</P>

<P>
 Their home for the next eight months will be an unheated aluminum geodesic 
dome 53 feet high and 160 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of that time, it will be winter at the bottom of the world. They will be 
enveloped in darkness relieved only by the eerie shimmering of the southern 
lights, aurora australis. 
</P>
<P>
 When they step outside the cramped but well-insulated living quarters, they 
may be greeted by temperatures 100 degrees below zero, made far colder beyond 
the dome by 30-knot winds. 
</P>
<P>
 They will have no possibility of escape from this human cocoon before late 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 It's called wintering over. 
</P>
<P>
 The last transport plane takes off from the U.S. South Pole Station's ice 
runway in late February, the end of the National Science Foundation's austral 
summer research season. 
</P>
<P>
 Those left behind at this remotest of all outposts are 28 carefully screened 
volunteers: scientists, construction workers, meteorologists and other support 
staff. Five are women. All have gone through psychological testing, interactive 
group training and a firefighting course. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people thrive on the adventure. Four of the 28 have done it before. 
</P>
<P>
 They may live harmoniously or fractiously: Groups differ from year to year. 
Either way, it's an experience they'll never forget. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best natural laboratory to study people in an extreme environment 
like you have in outer space," said social scientist Jeffrey C. Johnson. "A 
moon base will be a lot like this place." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, based at East Carolina University in Greenville, N.C., has a grant to 
study the social structure of groups that winter over at the pole. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it really boils down to," he said, "is that as long as you do your work, 
engage socially and have a sense of humor, people like you." Those most likely 
to have problems, said Johnson, are inflexible, opinionated know-it-alls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody goes through a stage or two of pretty good depression," said 
Stanley P. Wisneski, who has wintered over twice, most recently as station 
manager in 1992-93 for Antarctic Support Associates, the company that contracts 
with the National Science Foundation to operate U.S. research facilities in 
Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely, it's not made for everyone," said meteorologist Ann Adams of 
Phoenix. She and another meteorologist will spend more time outdoors than most 
of the others, reading instruments and launching weather balloons. 
</P>
<P>
 One who enjoys winter life at the South Pole is James Stine of Beldenville, 
Wis. A veteran of three summers and two winters in Antarctica, Stine is an 
affable giant with a beard and a Mohawk haircut who manages the power plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could do one or the other, I think I'd take winter," he said. "We're 
more of a close-knit family. I like the lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 Romances sometimes bloom in the austral dark. One former manager recalls three 
weddings that have resulted from winter pairings. 
</P>
<P>
 For everybody, the lifestyle requires some accommodation. 
</P>
<P>
 At its best, the South Pole is a daunting place. It's a pinprick on a frozen 
continent the size of the United States and Mexico combined. The average mean 
temperature at the pole is minus 56. 
</P>
<P>
 In every direction, the polar landscape is a flat, white sheet. The elevation 
is 9,300 feet, but when low barometric pressure is factored in, it feels more 
like 10,500 feet. Many newcomers suffer from altitude sickness. 
</P>
<P>
 Most scientific work at the pole is done during the short austral summer 
season, November through January, when the sun is constantly overhead. The 
emphasis is on astrophysics. 
</P>
<P>
 Peak population is 125, many of whom live in a "summer camp" of insulated 
half-circle canvas buildings outside the dome. The winter-over crew, however, 
squeezes into buildings inside the dome. 
</P>
<P>
 People work together, eat together and play together. Water, made from thawed 
ice, is always in short supply: Showers are limited to two a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The kitchen at South Pole Station has a reputation for excellent cuisine. 
Summer and winter, all hands are expected to volunteer for serving and cleanup 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
 After long work days, the small polar community relaxes with cards, video 
movies, a well-stocked library, a weight room and gym, a pool table and "volley 
bag," a space-conserving volleyball variant using a rolled-up cloth ball in 
place of an inflated one. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcohol is rationed. Drinking has been a problem with some winter-over groups. 
"It's very easy for one drink to turn into 10," said Wisneski. 
</P>
<P>
 "The isolation is the worst thing of all," he said. "If you dwell on when 
you're leaving, you're going to lose your mind. The busier you keep yourself, 
the more enjoyable your time will be." 
</P>
<P>
 One antidote is communication with stateside friends and family. Besides 
shortwave radio, there are satellite-connected telephones and computerized 
electronic mail. 
</P>
<P>
 But the best time of all is the equivalent of Christmas in July, at the depth 
of the dark winter, when an Air Force C-141 Starlifter transport drops food, 
supplies -- and mail. 
</P>
<P>
 The station's well-lit greenhouse is a popular place for people depressed by 
the endless darkness. Janet Phillips, the 1993-94 winter manager, has installed 
full-spectrum fluorescent lights, a proven remedy for seasonal blues. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there's no way out for the winter crew, regardless of the severity of 
a problem, a physician is always among them. "This is not a fun place to be 
sick," said the current one, Dr. Robert B. Lutes of Brentwood, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
 Cold-weather complaints such as hypothermia and frostbite are rare, Lutes 
said, for two reasons: excellent equipment and the good sense to come in out of 
the cold whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
 In the pole's high, frigid, super-dry atmosphere, the most common afflictions 
are upper-respiratory infections. Lutes dispenses plenty of antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
 One way or another, polar life leaves its mark on everyone who winters over. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get out you have to readjust to the world," said Wisneski. "All of a 
sudden you have to worry about crossing a street, paying for a meal, buying 
groceries, paying for a bed. It's a big change."

SENIOR PATRONS PEEVED AT MCRUSH PUT ON EATING; FAST FOOD: OLDER PEOPLE, 
SAVORING GOLDEN YEARS, OBJECT TO BEING HARASSED FOR 'LINGERING' UNDER THE 
GOLDEN ARCHES AT OUTLET IN BOSTON SUBURB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 What you want isn't always what you get at one fast food restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Older patrons at a restaurant in this Boston suburb say they've been harassed 
for being too slow with their fast food. 
</P>
<P>
 The manager of a McDonald's, exasperated with lingering diners, even imposed a 
20-minute limit on how long they could remain seated after finishing their 
meals. 
</P>
<P>
 After six months and many howls of protest from older customers, that policy 
was abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation points to a larger problem, experts say. Senior citizens who 
have time on their hands don't always have someplace to spend it. 
</P>
<P>
 The town, which is home to about 55,000 people, has about 10,000 residents 
over the age of 60, said Ruthann Dobek, staff coordinator for the Brookline 
Council on Aging. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no center for older people. And the bustling Coolidge Corner 
intersection where the one-story restaurant is located doesn't have as many 
coffee shops as it once did, according to Michael Merrill, chairman of the 
Board of Selectmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all need places to go," said gerontologist Eric Kingson of Boston College. 
"There's a certain irony here. Usually, we think of young people loitering. 
Here we have a group of older people making use of the time-honored tradition 
of sitting around and having a nice chat in a pleasant place to be." 
</P>
<P>
 The golden years mean nothing under these golden arches, some older residents 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 The time limit was ended in December, said owner Allan Bowermaster. Signs came 
down, but manager Bob Wilson continues to give some people the bum's rush, 
several said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you come in, he says, 'Buy something or get out,' " said David Godes, 
62. "He won't bother young people. They make noise, rip the place apart, but he 
says nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Some believe the 55-seat restaurant discourages older people from lingering 
because they are able to buy food and beverages at reduced rates. Coffee costs 
only 25 cents for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the treatment is hard to swallow, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in a lot of McDonald's, but I've never seen anything like this," 
said Thomas Vocase, 66. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's right to rush people out. People can't rush their food, 
especially elderly people who have false teeth. They have to chew their food," 
said Gladys Cooper, 73. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson would not answer questions. He referred a reporter to Bowermaster, who 
denied that customers are being harassed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we found out it (time limit) wasn't working, we stopped it," said 
Bowermaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal in the business is to provide a good experience to all customers. In 
the past, we thought we had to limit the length of the visit, but we learned 
some people objected to the idea," said Bowermaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowermaster said he met with several older customers, who made the point that 
they had nowhere else to congregate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obvious why they want to be there. There's activity, people talk 
politics and current events, and there's an energy level people want. That's 
what keeps people young, talking with other people and having that 
interaction," said Dobek. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Hulbert, a spokeswoman for McDonald's Corp. at its Oak Brook, Ill., 
headquarters, said she knew of no McDonald's that put a time limit on 
customers. And she said the company strives to include senior citizens, both as 
customers and as employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Senior citizens at McDonald's is part of our culture," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's restaurants sponsor bingo games, mall-walking groups, shuffleboard 
contests and other programs for older people, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always had older people working with us. We've always reached out to 
the senior community. They are wonderful customers and wonderful employees," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To Dobek and others, it's a sociological issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have needs for public places for private conversations and 
socializing," said Kingson. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingson said longer life expectancy can have a down side. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current cohort of older people are probably the first group that has this 
gift of extra years. It raises lots of questions about leisure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some say today's old are the pioneers of the next generation of old. This is 
one of many issues of leisure that comes up," said Kingson.

 A Dutch restaurant is turning the culinary clock back to the time of the Nazi 
occupation by serving tulip bulb soup. 
</P>
<P>
 Chef Rob Pauv at the Igesz restaurant in this northwestern city is keeping the 
recipe under his hat, but he said Friday that employees at the restaurant who 
have tasted the dish say it's delicious.

 During the "Hunger Winter" of 1944, the German occupiers stripped the nation 
of foodstuffs to send to Germany.

 The starving Dutch dug up and cooked bitter tulip bulbs from their gardens to 
stay alive.

PIONEERS OF WOMEN AIRFORCE SERVICE PROVED SKY IS NO LIMIT; AVIATION: AS 
NATION'S FIRST FEMALE MILITARY FLIERS, THEY FREED MEN FOR OVERSEAS DUTY IN 
WORLD WAR II. BUT WASPS WERE NOT ACKNOWLEDGED AS PART OF THE SERVICE UNTIL 
1977.

 When Iola Magruder was 15, she took $4 from her piggy bank to treat herself 
and a niece to their first airplane ride. It was so thrilling that they ran 
back and got another $4. 
</P>
<P>
 From that moment, the young Maryland farm girl knew she wanted to fly. 
</P>
<P>
 She got her wish during World War II, when she became a WASP. 
</P>
<P>
 The WASPs -- Women's Airforce Service Pilots -- were the nation's first female 
military pilots, although the federal government did not acknowledge them as 
such until 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 The female civilian pilots were used by the Army Air Force to free men for 
overseas duty. They flew domestic missions -- ferrying planes, hauling gunnery 
targets, transporting cargo, serving as instructors, testing overhauled 
aircraft and acting as aerial gofers if a delivery had to be made. 
</P>
<P>
 As a group, the WASPs flew nearly every type of plane in the nation's arsenal 
-- from trainers to the biggest bombers -- logging 60 million miles. 
</P>
<P>
 "What people like the WASPs did is they laid the groundwork, showing the 
capability that women could do things in aviation," said Linda DuMoulin, a 
retired lieutenant colonel from Alexandria, Va. "We were capable of flying and 
handling equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 All WASPs had flight training before joining the program. More than 25,000 
women applied; only 1,830 were accepted and 1,074 graduated from flight school, 
located for most classes in Sweetwater, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a heady life for women who had been nurses, teachers, debutantes, 
secretaries and housewives, many of whom had to cajole parents, even husbands, 
to join. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an adventure," said former WASP Winifred Wood of Idlewild, Calif., 
whose niece is U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was such a different life," said Wood, who learned to fly in a seaplane. 
"I had never much been away from Florida and Georgia. I went to Texas where it 
was dry and hot. I had never flown a land plane." 
</P>
<P>
 She wrote a book about her experiences, "We Were WASP." 
</P>
<P>
 "That was my favorite book," said Reno. "I still have the copy I had as a 
child in my apartment in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 Reno grew up hearing tales from her aunt and other WASPs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They taught me you can do anything you want to do if it's the right thing to 
do. You can defend your country, or do anything," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 WASP missions and training were not without danger; 38 women died. Since they 
were technically civilians, they were not entitled to death benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Darr of Chevy Chase, Md., who now teaches writing at American University 
in Washington, D.C., was stationed in Las Vegas when a fellow WASP was shot 
down and killed while towing a target for gunnery practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took up a collection because the Army said they were not responsible," she 
said. "Civil service said they were not responsible. I was so humiliated that 
our government could treat us that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I became a feminist the day we took up the collection in Las Vegas to send 
the body home." 
</P>
<P>
 Still they flew, and loved it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always just liked being up there in the air and flying around like an 
eagle, especially flying above the clouds. It looks like heaven up there," said 
Magruder. 
</P>
<P>
 The Women's Airforce Service Pilots was formed out of two groups created in 
1942: the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron, a cadre of experienced pilots, 
which got its start at New Castle Army Air Base near Wilmington, Del., under 
Nancy Harkness Love, and a women's military pilot training program, directed by 
Jacqueline Cochran. 
</P>
<P>
 After the two merged in 1943, the mixture never really settled well. Love and 
Cochran were accomplished aviators of different backgrounds and temperament, 
each protective of her turf. Love worked to create a squadron of skilled ferry 
pilots. Cochran wanted to prove women with less experience could be trained to 
fly as well as men. Her goal was a women's air corps. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of 1944, male pilots began returning home in increasing numbers. 
And the Army's use of female pilots never won the favor of the wartime 
Congress. Lawmakers rejected legislation that would have allowed the Army to 
commission the WASPs as officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization was decommissioned on Dec. 20, 1944. Not until November, 
1977, did Congress pass legislation that gave the secretary of defense 
authority to grant them military recognition, which came in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Some tears were shed when the WASPs' wings were clipped. Some women 
volunteered to fly for free, Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they couldn't do that," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethel Finley, of Rehoboth Beach, Del., president of the Women Airforce Service 
Pilots, WWII -- a nonprofit group of former WASPs -- is philosophical about the 
group's unceremonious end. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, World War II was the point where women broke out of traditional roles 
in general," she said. "The flying field was perhaps the most non-traditional. 
They didn't know what to do with us. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started out as an experiment, and it worked. They found that we could do 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the military or the public were quite ready to accept it, but 
it laid the groundwork for what women are doing now."

<P>
 Tonya Harding was assaulted in a city park near the apartment complex where 
she has been staying with friends, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding suffered scrapes and bruises and a sprained wrist in the attack, which 
occurred about 11 p.m. Thursday.Police said it is possible she was targeted. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding told investigators she was walking from her pickup truck through 
McMillan Park to the apartment complex when a man knocked her down from behind, 
police spokesman Mark Hyde said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The man then jumped on her back and a struggle ensued. The assailant, who 
didn't say anything, fled when Harding set off a personal alarm, Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
 She ran back to her friends' apartment and called police. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding was treated for bruises on her knees and elbows and a sprained left 
wrist at a hospital, then released, Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding placed eighth in Olympic figure skating. Her former husband, Jeff 
Gillooly, has pleaded guilty to arranging an attack on her skating rival, Nancy 
Kerrigan. He implicated Harding in the scheme; she denies it. An investigation 
is ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan recovered and won the silver medal.

WIDE EXPANSES OF HUMAN SKIN EXPOSED TO RESURGENT POLYNESIAN TATTOOS; NEW 
ZEALAND: A FULL SAMOAN TATTOO IS A MARK OF MANHOOD AND KNOWLEDGE. ANYONE WHO 
STOPS BEFORE THE JOB IS COMPLETE MAY BE REGARDED AS A COWARD. WOMEN ALSO WEAR 
THE DESIGNS.

<P>
 In the back yard shed, the rhythmic tapping on red, raw flesh continued for 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't think about the pain; that will only make it worse," Paul Suluape said, 
wiping a trickle of blood from the right arm of his grimacing customer. 
</P>
<P>
 Suluape is a tufuga tatau, or master tattooist, from Western Samoa -- one of a 
growing number who practice the ancient, intricate craft in Auckland. 
</P>
<P>
 Samoan tattoos are as detailed as the process is long and painful. 
</P>
<P>
 A full set for a man requires many sessions over weeks, even months, to 
complete. It will cover his lower torso, from just above the waist down to his 
knees, with fine lines, swirls, dots and dashes. Bands on the upper arms also 
are common. 
</P>
<P>
 Women are tattooed from knees to ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 Auckland, the largest city in New Zealand, has about 170,000 Polynesians among 
its 1 million people, the largest concentration in the world. They have been 
lured south over more than 20 years by the hope of jobs, despite a climate too 
chilly for coconut palms. 
</P>
<P>
 Polynesians have been tattooing one another for at least 2,000 years. In the 
last century, Christian missionaries decried the practice as pagan, but could 
not stop it. 
</P>
<P>
 The current revival is particularly strong among young Samoans who were born 
in New Zealand and want to retain their cultural heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Suluape, 43, began tattooing as a teen-ager, not long before moving to New 
Zealand. He sits cross-legged on a woven reed mat and the customer lies flat on 
his back or stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the electric pens used in modern tattoo parlors, he works with a 
set of small combs with needle-sharp teeth, which he makes from turtle shell or 
pig tusks. 
</P>
<P>
 Each comb is bound to the end of a stick with twine. Suluape dips one comb 
into a bowl of black ink and holds another stick crosswise underneath to help 
steady his hand and control the tapping rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the tapping is light, it is firm enough for the teeth to pierce the 
skin, break tiny blood vessels and leave ink embedded. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers are sore for days afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pain is like a burning sensation which builds and builds with every tap," 
said Faa Viaelua, 25, a police officer of Samoan descent, who had a full tattoo 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 A full Samoan tattoo is a mark of manhood and knowledge. Anyone who stops 
before the job is complete may be regarded as a coward. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can bring great shame to your family," Viaelua said. 
</P>
<P>
 Complete body tattoos are found in the Marquesas Islands of French Polynesia, 
and many forms of tattooing survive on most other South Pacific islands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is one of Polynesia's most vigorous arts," said Roger Neich, an 
ethnologist at Auckland Museum. "The missionaries tried to stop it and failed. 
As far as we know, Polynesians have been tattooing themselves for as long as 
they have existed." 
</P>
<P>
 Suluape's motifs are strictly traditional, but are more decorative than 
symbolic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The design comes to me as I work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Long ago, oily tree nuts were burned and the soot was used to make the ink. 
Some tattooists now use soot from kerosene lamps, but Suluape prefers 
commercial ink. He said it does not fade and the wounds heal more quickly, with 
less chance of infection. 
</P>
<P>
 His other concession to the 20th Century is hygiene. He cleans his combs with 
a sterilizing machine and chemicals similar to those used in hospital operating 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 A few white New Zealanders, known among Polynesians as Palangi, are among 
Suluape's clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific tattoos have fascinated foreigners for 200 years, since the first 
European seafarers dropped anchor off Samoa and peered through telescopes at 
the shore. 
</P>
<P>
 When they saw the tattoos, "the Palangi thought the Samoans were wearing 
pantaloons," Suluape said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailors corrupted the Polynesian word "tatau" and took their own version of 
the craft back to Europe.

WORLD BANK LENDS VIETNAM $96 MILLION TO HELP FARMERS

 The World Bank has signed an agreement with Vietnam for a $96-million 
development loan to improve the country's rural credit system and rubber 
production, an official report said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The loan is the bank's third to Vietnam since international lending resumed 
last fall. The 40-year agricultural credit will carry a concessional interest 
rate, but the report from the state-run Vietnam News Agency did not specify the 
percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 International banks began again to lend to Vietnam following President 
Clinton's decision in July to end U.S. opposition to such a step.

EZRA STONE; PLAYED HENRY ALDRICH ON RADIO SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ezra Stone, radio's long-suffering Henry Aldrich, a woeful teen-ager whose 
plaintive cry of "Coming, Mother!" became an anthem in American living rooms, 
has died. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone, who also helped stage Irving Berlin's legendary "This Is the Army" 
revue during World War II, was killed in an automobile accident Thursday in 
Woodbridge, N.J. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone had been living in Newton, Pa., on the family farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Associated Press reported that Stone was on the New Jersey Turnpike when his 
car veered off the road. The wire service quoted police as saying he died at 
the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone had been acting since he was 7 years old, when he started doing radio 
and local stage productions near his home in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 The character for which he will always be known grew out of "What a Life," a 
play produced by George Abbott in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
 It was written by Clifford Goldsmith, and its success moved Goldsmith into the 
top echelon of radio writers at $3,000 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in the play that Stone first created the cacophonous, cracking voice 
that became a symbol of the pain of adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
 He was only 19 when he first played Henry and, by the following year, he would 
direct his first play -- Milton Berle's "See My Lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 From Broadway, Stone and "The Aldrich Family," as they came to be known, moved 
into national radio as an interlude on the Rudy Vallee show. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1939, the family had become so popular that Henry, who remained age 16 
through the 14-year run of the show, and his family evolved into their own time 
slot on NBC, where his mirthful mayhem was heard first on Tuesdays and then 
Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
 At least once each week, Henry's mother, played by Lea Penman, would call out 
for her son: "Hen-Ree! Henry Aldrich." 
</P>
<P>
 His throaty response of "Coming, Mother!" brought forth laughter that almost 
always overwhelmed the next few words of dialogue both at home and in the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry was always the focal point of madness. His efforts to make a phone call 
would eventually put every phone in town out of service; if he was sent to the 
store, every merchant in the area would somehow suffer; a lost pair of pants 
evolved into a crisis that threatened his family and relationship with his 
girl, Kathleen. 
</P>
<P>
 During World War II, Stone joined the Army Special Services unit, although he 
was frequently permitted to fulfill his radio obligations. 
</P>
<P>
 During the war, Stone, Gary Merrill and Josh Logan -- under Berlin's direction 
-- produced a musical revue of 300 soldiers to entertain their fellow 
servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he staged morale boosters for IBM salespeople and directed many 
episodes of popular TV series. Among them were "I Love Lucy," "Lost in Space," 
"Laredo," "Julia," "Lassie" and "The Munsters." 
</P>
<P>
 Stone, who late in life could still entertain friends with Henry Aldrich's 
wailings, was a widower. He is survived by a son, daughter, sister and four 
grandchildren.

IVOL CURTIS; RETIRED EPISCOPAL BISHOP HELD NO. 2 POST IN L.A. IN LATE '50S, 
'60S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rt. Rev. Ivol Ira Curtis, former suffragan bishop of the Diocese of Los 
Angeles and more recently bishop of the Seattle-based Episcopal Diocese of 
Olympia, where he was credited with great strides in advancing civil rights and 
battling poverty, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Los Angeles Diocese, where he served as chief assistant to 
the Rt. Rev. Francis Eric Bloy from 1959 until 1964, said Curtis was 85 when he 
died Tuesday near Laguna Hills, where he had retired 18 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis was praised in a Seattle Post-Intelligencer obituary as "a man . . . 
who displayed an incredible capacity to keep people talking to each other and 
keep doors open" during the civil rights unrest of the 1960s and 1970s. The 
newspaper also cited Curtis' efforts to feed the poor during the 1969-70 
recession that racked Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis held divinity degrees from the Seabury-Western Seminary in Evanston, 
Ill., and several honorary doctorates. 
</P>
<P>
 He came to Los Angeles from Pontiac, Mich., after serving churches in 
Massachusetts and New York since his ordination in 1935. He became rector of 
St. James Church, serving the Wilshire district and Hancock Park area of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 During his years in Los Angeles, the diocese grew to encompass eight counties 
and 181 congregations with a membership of more than 125,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis is survived by his wife, Lillian, two sons, three grandchildren and one 
great-grandchild. Services will be in Seattle on March 19.

COMMENTARY; THE '94 LILLEHAMMER GAMES PROVIDED SO MANY MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE KINDRED, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The old man with a devil's chin whiskers, Maurilio de Zolt, is an Italian 
cross-country skier who at 43 trains on wine and cheese, bread and wine, 
everything accompanied by wine. "It is difficult to say how many glasses of 
wine I had, and if I knew I'd rather not say it here," he says, an eyebrow 
raised, "because I'd probably get in trouble with my associations." Which 
prompts memory of Jean-Claude Killy's line at Grenoble in 1968 when the 
Frenchman won three gold medals and defended his training regimen by saying, 
"Would you rather I not drink wine -- and ski like an American?" 
</P>
<P>
 The last day of the Lillehammer Olympics, Maurilio de Zolt was seen with frost 
and ice clinging to his beard as billows of chilled breath preceded him through 
the forest that was the scene of the 50-kilometer race, the classic event of 
the wintry games. Spectators by the tens of thousands lined the route, most 
waving Norway's red flag with the blue cross, children sitting in snowdrifts 
atop houses, everyone loving these moments that tell us the improbable is yet 
the possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Improbable that a bobsled would slide on Lillehammer's ice under 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's flag? And that it would carry four men, a Serb and a 
Croatian sitting around two Muslims? Here they were with brakeman Igor Boras 
saying, "Ten years ago, when we staged the Winter Olympics, Sarajevo was a 
paradise on earth for us. But it was blood red and a living hell when I left 
this time. We are showing to the Bosnian people and the world that we can live 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 We will forget Tonya Harding as we forget all those who choose to betray their 
gift of talent. We will remember the Bosnians as we remember the old iceman, de 
Zolt, who chose to pursue excellence across mountains in three Olympics and 
finally won a medal, a gold as the leadoff man for Italy's 30-kilometer 
relayers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is de Zolt of whom the Norwegian hero Bjorn Dahlie says, "I was impressed 
by him at the 1992 Olympics because, even then, he was old enough to be my 
father. No, I do not think I will ski that fast when I am 43 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 We will remember the moments when these Olympics gave substance to words 
spoken in a Lillehammer house above frozen Lake Mjosa. The Russians rented the 
place with Reebok shoe money, apprentice capitalists learning from the masters. 
They laid on caviar in a room decorated with peasant shirts and silver 
samovars. There, the president of the Russian Olympic Committee, Vitali 
Smirnov, says sport is important: "It gives us optimism." 
</P>
<P>
 As we leave the Russians' house, an American reporter says, "You don't believe 
anything that fat old souse said, do you?" 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, the Russian boss is a propagandist for his own well-being. Maybe he 
calls sport a source of optimism to justify his privileged life in a poor 
country so beleaguered that its existence is subject daily to whims of 
warriors, politicians and other madmen. 
</P>
<P>
 None of which changes the truth of what Smirnov says about sport. Anyone 
reaching for the stars lifts us all. Even the morning after the massacre of 
Israeli athletes and coaches at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, a Japanese coach 
said the games should go on. "There is more good here," he said, "than 
criminals can erase." 
</P>
<P>
 From these Norway games, we will remember Yi Qiabo, the star-crossed Chinese 
speedskater who, 28 years old with a bad knee, finished third to Bonnie Blair 
in the women's 1000 meters and then, crying, says she cried not because of her 
knee but because she realized she would never skate in another Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very pain," Yi says, "and I could not do my best on the last turn of 
my whole life." 
</P>
<P>
 One last turn, or as American skier Diann Roffe-Steinrotter says, "The 
Olympics is one day, one hill, 1 1/2 minutes. Whoever shakes and bakes the best 
is going to get a gold medal." One turn, one hill, a life's work, the best of 
us reaching for the stars. And we will remember, always, Dan Jansen gliding in 
the starlight, his baby girl in his arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Johann Olav Koss is a Norwegian speedskating hero who set a world record in 
the 10,000 meters that may stand for half a century. He also won two other gold 
medals and there is talk of preserving his 1994 likeness in a statue that would 
grace the Viking Ship hall where he did his wonders. In his moment of victory, 
Koss announced what he would do with the $30,000 awarded him by Norway's 
Olympic committee. He would send it to Sarajevo, where the need for money is 
desperate. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps other athletes made private donations. Of Americans, only Bonnie Blair 
revealed hers. She would give $5,000. Two seats away at a press conference, the 
new American millionaire Nancy Kerrigan did a recital of her soup contracts, 
shoe deals and sunglasses agreements before ending with a giggle. "So many," 
she says. She offered the Sarajevans nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll remember Kerrigan in her golden glittery outfit on the night of her 
life. She skated as well as she can, good enough for a silver medal behind the 
Ukraine waif, Oksana Bayul, an orphan, only 16, a survivor of tragedies not to 
be confused with the inconveniences of a knee that is sore to the touch. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll remember Oksana Bayul's face when she first saw scores that celebrated 
her performance, scores that confirmed the reality of the improbable. Her face 
became a mask of tears. We'll remember that her sorrow was not so far away that 
she could forget it in her moment of joy.

THE STORM PASSES FOR ANGELS' SNOW; HE GOES FROM SUCCESS TO FAILURE TO SUCCESS 
AND SEEKS AN EVEN KEEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 J.T. Snow stopped to grab an apple in the food line when he noticed a sudden 
flurry of movement. Reporters were being shooed away. The clubhouse doors were 
quickly locked. 
</P>
<P>
 This was weird. The entire Angel team had just settled into spring-training 
camp a few days ago, and now Manager Buck Rodgers was calling a team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Boy, someone sure must have done something wrong. He started feeling sorry for 
the poor soul who prompted it. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sudden attack of anxiety, Snow began replaying the day's events in his 
mind. Then it hit him. Maybe he was the one. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't help when he looked around and sensed that everyone was staring at 
him. Seconds later, he realized he had caused the meeting: 
</P>
<P>
 It was a surprise birthday party in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so maybe it wasn't the type of bash that you run home and tell your wife 
about, but the event left Snow overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Apprehensive that he would be ostracized when he set foot in the Angel 
clubhouse a year ago, and never quite feeling comfortable, Snow was now being 
officially accepted by his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, he was one of the guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone even came up to me to wish me, 'Happy Birthday,' last 
year," said Snow, 26 last week. "All they knew was that Jim Abbott was gone, 
and I was one of the guys they got in return. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys were checking me out all spring. They wanted to see what they got in 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just kept my mouth shut and tried to show everybody that I belonged." 
</P>
<P>
 The uncertainty and skepticism lasted until the regular season began, and by 
mid-April everybody knew about J.T. Snow. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the next five months they weren't sure just what they knew. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow's season was like standing in front of one of a mirror in a fun house. 
The image differed drastically, depending upon the angle from which you viewed 
it. It was exaggerated, complimentary and, sometimes, appalling, but never 
definitive. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you start and end a season winning the American League 
player-of-the-week award and spend the time in between trying to figure out 
what happened? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure if I've ever seen a season quite like it," Rodgers said. "He ran 
through the entire gamut of emotions. The whole season was one long 
rollercoaster ride, and no one knew what time he was getting on or off. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'll tell you this, what J.T. did that first month was the greatest thing 
that could have happened to us. He not only benefited himself, but he benefited 
this entire organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, if he didn't get off to that start, we wouldn't be in the 
position (to contend) like are today." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This was crazy. After battling all spring to make the Angel roster, suddenly 
he was the reincarnation of Wally Joyner. 
</P>
<P>
 It started with a home run in his second at-bat on opening day. He was hitting 
.368 with five runs batted in at the end of the first week of the season. He 
had six homers and 17 RBIs by the second week. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Roger Clemens and the Boston Red Sox came to Anaheim on April 25, 
Snow was batting .407 and featured on TV sportscasts from coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when everything started to happen," Snow said. "It hit me all at once. 
The expectations just became unreal. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were telling me I was going to be the rookie of the year after one 
week. Someone even projected me to hit more homers than Roger Maris. People 
were acting crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trouble was I got caught up in it, too. They told me in spring training 
just to relax, and that if I hit .260 with 10 homers and 50 RBIs it would a 
great year. 
</P>
<P>
 "But after the first month, everything changed. My expectations went up, too. 
I figured no problem, I'd hit .280 to .300 with 25 homers." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jack Snow, J.T.'s father: "He told me, 'Honest, Dad, I don't know what 
I'm doing, but everything I do is working.' 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the part that scared the hell out of me. He had nowhere to go but 
down. My son is not Ted Williams." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone knew it would be impossible for Snow to continue at this pace, and 
the Angels were not going to stay in first place the entire season, but the 
dream continued. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow became one of the biggest crazes to hit Southern California since the 
surfboard. Everyone wanted a piece of him. He was receiving nearly 200 fan 
letters daily. Classmates from third grade were calling him. Stacks of 
interview and promotional requests awaited him every day he entered the 
clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where the trouble started," said shortstop Gary DiSarcina, who had a 
locker next to Snow. "He tried to accommodate everyone but himself. Instead of 
coming to the ballpark for early work, he was there doing interviews and 
signing everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was carrying the entire ballclub, but he had so much thrown onto his 
shoulders, you knew something was bound to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 It finally did. In that nationally televised game against the Red Sox, 
Clemens, taking it upon himself to provide his own rookie initiation program, 
fired a pitch behind Snow's head that sent him sprawling. Snow struck out, and 
for the first time in a week, failed to get a hit during the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Snow learned all about how umpires carried out their initiation programs 
the next night. He was called out on a third strike and, frustrated, dropped 
his bat and helmet at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 The plate umpire, whom the Angels would prefer not to name because of possible 
repercussions, screamed at Snow: "Hey kid, just remember I can bury you in this 
game. I can get you sent back to A-ball just as quickly as you got here." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers intervened, but it soon became a trend that the Angels would complain 
about all season. Still, it was no excuse. The pitches that Snow had been 
sending over the fence now were being hit meekly to second base. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went from doing everything right," Snow said, "to doing everything possibly 
wrong. I tried everything. I looked at videotapes. I took extra batting 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more things I tried, the more nothing worked. It was the toughest, most 
difficult thing I've ever had to go through in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow, who was batting .343 by the end of April, hit .124 in May, and his 
season average plummeted to .223 before Rodgers summoned him to his office on 
the night of July 26. 
</P>
<P>
 The words came from Rodgers, but Snow was too dazed to hear them. He was being 
sent to Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 He was back in the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't hit me until I was sitting in the L.A. airport waiting for my 
flight to Vancouver," Snow said. "It was like, 'Man, what happened to me? Am I 
this bad? Was April just a fluke?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't even think straight." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision numbed the entire team. It was as if they had suddenly realized 
that their dream season was over. They had lost 10 of their last 11 games, 
dropping nine game behind the Chicago White Sox and out of contention in the 
American League West. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very tough for all of us," Angel second baseman Torey Lovullo said. 
"We all know what J.T. meant to this team. It was incredible what he did for 
this team early on." 
</P>
<P>
 Right fielder Tim Salmon, who would become the unanimous winner of the 
rookie-of-the-year award, benefited perhaps more than anyone from Snow's start. 
While everyone was mesmerized by Snow, few even noticed that Salmon was batting 
.234 in the first month of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thanked him for taking the spotlight off me," Salmon said. "I was able to 
learn from his mistakes. I got a chance to stand back and keep my perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "J.T. never had a chance to do that. You could see his expectations change. 
They became too great. He just put too much pressure on himself." 
</P>
<P>
 The despair of being back in the minors was difficult to overcome. It felt bad 
enough just being in Vancouver, but the pangs of guilt over letting his friends 
and family down were even worse. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time Snow had ever felt like a failure. He had excelled at 
everything he tried, and was selected to the all-CIF teams in football, 
basketball and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just sick how good he was in every sport," said San Diego Padres 
reliever Trevor Hoffman, who grew up competing against Snow in Orange County. 
"He was a man among boys." 
</P>
<P>
 It took several days to recover emotionally, but Snow finally realized that 
this might be for the best. Besides, his friends had told him that Mickey 
Mantle was sent down to the minors in his rookie season, and he turned out all 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest part was that in the players' lounge they always had the Angels' 
games on TV," Snow said. "I couldn't watch it. I'd just go back to my locker." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jack Snow: "I came real close to going up to Vancouver myself, but then I 
thought, 'Hey, the kid has to do this one his own. He's got to do it himself.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'll tell you, it was hard on all of us. We went to a few (Angel) games, 
but it was difficult to watch Rene Gonzales play first base when you think your 
son should be the one out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow, who went zero for 13 with eight strikeouts in his first four games at 
Vancouver, returned to Anaheim three weeks later. He had raised his batting 
average to .340 with five homers and 24 RBIs by the time Vancouver Manager Max 
Oliveras told the Angels that Triple-A no longer presented a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow came back a more aggressive, confident hitter, attacking the ball instead 
of waiting for the perfect pitch. During the final five weeks of the season, he 
batted .281 with five homers and 14 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may be wrong," Oliveras said, "but I don't think he'll ever be going back 
there again." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Snow sat on an otherwise empty bench, recalling things he had long tried to 
forget. His teammates had left the practice field nearly an hour ago, but when 
Snow got up to leave, he was swarmed by two dozen fans. 
</P>
<P>
 He stopped, signed autographs and smiled politely, listening to everyone's 
advice. "Go get 'em, J.T. Do it just like you did in April, J.T. You're still 
our favorite, J.T." 
</P>
<P>
 He wondered if the fans would still be there for him if he hadn't grown up in 
Orange County, in the shadow of Anaheim Stadium. But he also had doubts whether 
his struggles would have been so severe if he weren't a local hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing in your hometown was a lot tougher than I thought it would be," Snow 
said. "Everybody was always seeing me, whether it's coming to the game at home 
or watching one on TV while we're on the road. It's almost like it gave 
everyone the right to give me advice or make suggestions." 
</P>
<P>
 This year will be different, Snow vowed. It's not as if he'll turn into a 
jerk, but he's going to quit trying to accommodate the world. If he needs 
advice, he plans to listen to batting coach Rod Carew and Rodgers. If he needs 
comfort and solace, he said he'll turn to his bride, Stacie, whom he married in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've shown people I can play this game. I know I belong. There's no 
doubt in my mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing I'd like better than to get off to that kind of start again, 
but if I do, I promise you things will be different. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh yeah, things will be different."

POINT OF VIEW / BOB OATES; A SOUND-BITE GENERATION; BASKETBALL'S FAST-THINKING 
FANS FAVOR FASTEST SPORT; BASEBALL IS AS GOOD AS EVER, BUT CAN'T HOLD THE 
AUDIENCE

 As everyday baseball resumes this spring and as the basketball season begins 
to wind down, one thing is evident: On the popularity meter, these are sports 
heading in different directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball is gaining everywhere. Baseball, the undisputed national pastime 30 
or 40 years ago, has lost its grip on the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide polls, television ratings, and other indicators make the critical 
points: 
</P>
<P>
 * Although pro football is America's most popular spectator game, the public's 
interest in basketball on all other fronts -- college, prep and playground -- 
is either comparable with football's or ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although attendance remains high for major league baseball -- identifying 
the game's loyal but aging fan base -- support for baseball has been declining 
in the country at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * The college basketball championship game has moved ahead of the World Series 
and become the nation's second-biggest annual sports attraction. In the most 
recent television ratings, the NCAA title game's 22.2 was exceeded only by the 
Super Bowl's 45.5. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1980, the average annual World Series TV rating has tumbled 47% to last 
fall's 17.3. By contrast, the NBA finals were up to a 17.9 average last spring, 
when college basketball's Final Four games averaged 17.0. 
</P>
<P>
 It shouldn't be supposed, though, that as a game, baseball has deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
 This is still the same superb game it was in the years before television, 
before radio, before telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 What has changed is the America that created baseball a century and a half 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, basketball is in tune with the times. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is an era of information overload, instant gratification and shortened 
attention spans. This, to use a TV phrase, is the sound-bite era. 
</P>
<P>
 And, contributing to the restive collective consciousness, basketball offers 
the quickness of movement and the repetitive, almost continuous, scoring that 
so strongly appeal to the sound-bite generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball, once the obvious leader, is losing ground not because of its 
defects, real or imagined, but because 1990s Americans want something livelier, 
more modern, more pertinent. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a country always in evolution, and its history, in large part, is a 
history of a quickening of pace. 
</P>
<P>
 In the slow, hard days before electric lights and indoor plumbing, the symbol 
of early America was the horse. Nothing moved faster than a horse could run. 
</P>
<P>
 The pace picked up with the coming of electric, steam and oil power to a more 
active generation, and the symbol of that somewhat hastier time was a baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 In those years, nothing moved faster than a ball could be hit with a bat, and 
baseball suitably became the national pastime. But that era, too, was doomed. 
</P>
<P>
 With fiber optics and computer science and dunked basketballs, the pace has 
quickened again, and the symbol of this new age is the sound bite. 
</P>
<P>
 Time appears to be instantaneous on living-color television. The evening news 
can acquaint the entire country with the latest war reports, or more often the 
latest scandals, in eight or 10 seconds, more or less. 
</P>
<P>
 And in doing so, TV people have found that that's all that Americans want to 
hear about anything, anyway, unless an ice skater has been assaulted.  
</P>
<P>
 As President Clinton recently said, "It's hard to get more than one message a 
day across to the American people." 
</P>
<P>
 If in such a country basketball is a better fit than baseball, the fit wasn't 
planned, it just happened, evolving out of the nature of basketball -- which 
not too long ago was a slow-moving sport with final scores of 28-27 and 32-30. 
</P>
<P>
 It has become a 104-102 sport because, for one thing, most of the nation's 
finest athletes are now in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have gone for pro basketball if I were taller," Kansas City Chief 
quarterback Joe Montana said, expressing a view often made by professionals in 
all sports. "Basketball was my favorite game in school." 
</P>
<P>
 Many nonprofessionals, who play neighborhood and playground basketball all 
over America, agree with the pros. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basketball has such deep roots," former coach Red Auerbach once said. "It's a 
team game that two people can play. In fact, it's a team game that one guy can 
play by himself." 
</P>
<P>
 As a spectator sport, it also differs considerably from the others. 
</P>
<P>
 On a typical winter night, in an interval of three or four seconds, you can 
watch the athletic 7-footers of the NBA make -- in one play -- a sequence of 
six or seven seemingly impossible moves, followed by somebody's sudden shot.  
</P>
<P>
 The shot drops in more often than not, starting a race to the other end of the 
court and, perhaps, a dunk, followed by another race and another basket and 
another race in a long, exciting melange of sound bites. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no home run trots, no balks, no huddles. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is the constant commotion that holds the attention of today's shouting 
sports fans, who have to think fast to keep up with it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Their thoughts wandered last fall when a baseball player, Lenny Dykstra, in 
one of the big events of the sports year, took five consecutive pitches in a 
typically slow-moving playoff game -- never moving his bat from his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Most end-of-the-century Americans don't have the time or patience to sit 
through the baseball playoffs. And so that night they missed one of the great 
athletic moments of our time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing that can speed up baseball is the 11 o'clock news. Between 
commercials, an entire World Series game can be staged in one sound bite 
without missing a significant pitch or base hit. 
</P>
<P>
 But that, of course, isn't the game that baseball fans love. 
</P>
<P>
 Theirs, they insist, is a sport without flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 As aspiring baseball player Michael Jordan said last year when he was still 
playing basketball: "I don't think baseball has done anything wrong. I think a 
new generation grew up with the NBA." 
</P>
<P>
 Still very much in place are all the aspects of baseball that made it the 
national pastime early in the 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
 As presented on warm summer evenings -- or even on cold nights in California 
-- baseball is still a pastoral game of precision, pageantry and a pleasing 
simplicity that masks often picturesque complexity. 
</P>
<P>
 As a television program, though, it doesn't adapt as well as basketball does 
or as football can with its avalanche of violent plays and instant replays. 
</P>
<P>
 So the best way to see a baseball game is to sit quietly in the stands, using 
binoculars now and then to focus on the batter, the pitcher, or the managers -- 
who can always be out-guessed -- or on such details as the changing alignments 
of the defensive teams. 
</P>
<P>
 With almost every pitch, one or more infielders will shift left or right, move 
in or out, and one or more outfielders will move a step or two or more. 
</P>
<P>
 For, if the score is close, every pitch begins a new ballgame, and any pitch 
can be decisive. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball, as its fans say, is a game of expectations. What doesn't happen can 
be as interesting as what does. And the game moves with such deliberate speed 
that every spectator has an opportunity to live in the minds of the principals 
-- the players and their managers -- and to think along with them pitch to 
pitch, out to out, inning to inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "For most clubs, the object is to get a runner to second base," Oakland A's 
Manager Tony LaRussa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once he's there, can the hitter get him home? 
</P>
<P>
 Can he do it if he falls behind, 0 and 2? 
</P>
<P>
 Can he do it if he works the count to 3 and 1? 
</P>
<P>
 It's a team game without a goal line to defend -- that is a baseball oddity -- 
but it's a team game only nominally. The essence of baseball is pitcher vs. 
hitter: the mind games of man vs. man. 
</P>
<P>
 No other sport except boxing is so conspicuously man to man. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dykstra personified the timeless nature of the sport last October when a 
National League playoff game was poking along as usual. Tenth inning, score 
even, 3-3, series even, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming to bat for the Philadelphia Phillies -- slowly -- Dykstra finally 
stepped in and took a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he took a ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Then another ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he took Strike 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Ball 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Five pitches -- and Dykstra's bat was still on his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Was anything happening? 
</P>
<P>
 Is there any drama when a good hitter just stands there looking at the 
pitches? 
</P>
<P>
 It all depends. 
</P>
<P>
 It depends on whether the viewer realizes -- or cares -- that in that spot, 
Dykstra, a singles hitter normally, is working the count for his home run pitch 
-- an inside fastball up in the strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he would have fouled off three or four if he'd had to," said Steve 
Moyer of Chicago's Stats, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the sixth pitch was Dykstra's. And since the home run he hit that 
time had been planned and deliberately executed, it could be recognized 
immediately for what it was -- one of the most difficult feats in all of team 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also the turning point in a series that ended the season for the 
Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who had the time to wait for it, that was a moment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Few things more clearly define the difference between baseball and basketball 
than what happens after the final play: 
</P>
<P>
 * When the game is over and the crowd leaves the arena, basketball fans find 
it hard to remember what went on, precisely. They know who won, but the rest is 
often a blur. 
</P>
<P>
 * By contrast, baseball fans, on their way home, or when they get there, can 
reconstruct the whole game in their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 A mental exercise of that sort is a distinct plus to baseball fans, as well as 
to football fans and golfers, who frequently replay their games, too. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's all irrelevant to basketball fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Their most recent game is a jot in history. Who wants to give it another 
thought? After the last dunk every night, basketball fans are instantly ready 
for another show.  
</P>
<P>
 The polls show that most baseball fans are over 50. Basketball fans tend to be 
much younger -- and it could be that their world was shaped by, of all things, 
TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 The sound-bite era began, some believe, with television's modern commercial 
messages, whose producers wished to cram a lot of information into a few 
seconds. Thus they started cutting quickly from this to that, and learned, in 
the process, that the optimum way to sell a complex message is with quick 
bites. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those viewing the earliest action commercials were the producers of TV 
news shows and movies, some of whom soon made movies that way, too, telling 
their simple stories with sequences of quick visual images. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's what killed old movies: Not just the sex and violence and color but 
also the modern pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Video games and MTV are likewise filled with rapidly changing images, and 
hence are more likely to appeal to younger sports fans.  
</P>
<P>
 And, quite possibly, such activities have made basketball fans mentally more 
alert than the Americans of 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 They simply think faster -- or at least process visual information faster -- 
than grandpa used to. 
</P>
<P>
 It ought not to come as a surprise, in any event, that today's sports fans, 
nourished on the action of the new commercials, the new movies, MTV and the 
like, and hammered by the continuous sound bites of television's news shows, 
should feel right at home at a basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
 And out of place in a ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of settling down and getting more deeply involved in something that 
is just a game is foreign to the sound-bite generation. 
</P>
<P>
 But not to baseball fans, who, in a relaxed ballpark setting, still enjoy 
matching wits with a manager who can't decide whether to change pitchers now or 
five minutes from now. 
</P>
<P>
 After the next pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the swiftness of the game makes basketball more congenial than 
baseball to the modern mind. 
</P>
<P>
 But it doesn't make it better. 
</P>
<P>
 The rarest individual in the sports world today is the man who can get three 
base hits in 10 major league at-bats. Who in the NBA can't dunk a basketball?

LEARNING THE SPORT OF KINGS; HORSE RACING: ABOUT 50 MILES NORTH OF LOS ANGELES, 
PARADISE RANCH BOASTS THAT IT IS THE ONLY SCHOOL IN THE NATION TO TRAIN MEN AND 
WOMEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Three dogs and a goat trot out to greet newcomers while aspiring jockeys get 
advice like: "Push those heels down and stick that rear end out a little 
further." 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to Paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradise Ranch Racing School, about 50 miles north of Los Angeles -- and a 
freeway ride away from Santa Anita, Hollywood Park, Del Mar and Los Alamitos -- 
boasts that it is the only school in the nation to train men and women in the 
sport of kings. 
</P>
<P>
 For $1,200 a month, a full-time student can learn how to become a jockey or 
exercise rider. There are also courses for racing stable management, how to be 
a groom or trainer, or how to prepare horses for sale. For another $275 per 
month, a serious student can live in the bunkhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "You gotta eat, sleep, drink, think, breathe racing and let your whip become 
your best friend," said apprentice John Atherton, an honors graduate from 
Paradise Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Atherton graduated from Paradise in 1991, the 22-year-old has ridden 
winners at Del Mar, Santa Anita and Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Another graduate -- Corey Nakatani, class of 1987 -- is one of the top riders 
in the nation. He is sixth nationally this year in the standings, with $1.4 
million in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Atherton was working the candy counter at Sears in Ventura when thoroughbred 
owner Red Tucker spotted him and said: "I know a better job for you. You should 
be a jockey." 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker tucked a Paradise Ranch card in Atherton's hand. The next time they 
met, Atherton was busy at his studies in Paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was here for eight months in '90 there were only a couple of students 
and a lot of horses. I got a lot more hands-on learning than book learning," 
Atherton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Atherton, who had never ridden a horse, was a quick study, said Paradise 
executive director Kristyn Goddard. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was like a sponge," she said, "an excellent student." 
</P>
<P>
 Atherton said he had to work hard to get good at everything, but that one 
thing did come naturally for him -- breaking from the gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Instructing at the practice gate, Atherton told boarder Mary Hausch, "The 
first thing you gotta do is grab . . . a mound of his hair." 
</P>
<P>
 Hausch, 19, of Keokuk, Iowa, was aboard Big Red at an old gate mounted on 
flattened tires. 
</P>
<P>
 Atherton said if Hausch grabs onto Red's mane, she won't topple over backward. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the gate, don't push or nothing," said Atherton, guest instructor for the 
day. "Go natural. Make sure his head is up and straight, his body's straight, 
then start listening for the call. You'll hear, 'Two out. One way back.' When 
you hear, 'One out,' you know the last horse is about ready and you only have 
seconds to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Hausch's first start was less than polished, as Big Red scooted sideways and 
she almost took a tumble. Hausch said she was thinking too much about getting 
her reins right. 
</P>
<P>
 Her second break went beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
 "When can you let go?" asked Chris Roberts, 20, of Palmdale, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you've got no more sensation of falling on your butt," Atherton said. 
"Let him break good and then put him back. Let him break freely, maybe two or 
three strides, maybe a 16th of a mile. Some things you just have to find out 
for yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the students heard what it's really like on the track, instructor 
Richard Budge took them through their turns and exercises: bunny hops, pullups, 
pushups, chinups, legups, knots, elevating, bellyups, girths. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the practice was done on a retired racer called Smokey and a couple of 
"babies" that the students broke themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Students must muck stables, hot walk, learn about medications and memorize 
every muscle and bone in the horse's body. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know not only how to gallop a horse," Atherton said, "I know where a horse 
is sore. I can point out things to trainers. You get to know a lot about horse 
muscles, their bones, how to tack a horse. You can do everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Atherton drew groans from the students when he said he had no problem with 
weight, that he could eat anything and still stay about 106 or 107 pounds. He 
described the weigh-ins in detail and what equipment counts and what doesn't. 
He suggested students eat oranges for energy, and pasta without buttery sauces. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said Laffit Pincay, one of the all-time top riders, had been eating 
rice cakes lately because he was having a problem with his weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Atherton also told students about what it's like to compete and what to expect 
from older jockeys. Novices can expect to be crowded to the rail and have their 
whips knocked out of their hands. They'll be yelled at, just to see how much 
they'll take. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a half-mile training track at Paradise, along with a three-stall 
starting gate, paddocks, "The Bullpen" training ring, and an arena marked with 
neon orange road cones. There are enough stalls for 80 horses. 
</P>
<P>
 Budge said that when he taught at jockey schools in France, Brazil and 
Britain, there could be anywhere from 20 to 100 students, while at Paradise 
there are seven. But the school puts out a good crop. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the leading apprentice at Portland (Ore.) Meadows was Mike Ardis, a 
1989 Paradise grad. Another 1989 graduate is Iggy Puglisi, a leading jockey in 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 The great Johnny Longden sent his granddaughter, Trudi Helm, to Paradise, 
which has an advisory committee that includes Hall of Fame trainer Jack Vanberg 
and jockey agent Warren Eves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very impressed with it," said Atherton, who now lives in Arcadia, near 
Santa Anita. "I came here thinking, I'll try it. I'll try it for my parents and 
grandparents. Thank God they did send me."

PUTTING THAT MTV GUY TO DEATH; DENIS LEARY STILL HAS THE BITE THAT CEMENTED HIS 
ANTSY PERSONA, FROM 'NO CURE FOR CANCER' TO HIS CINDY CRAWFORD RAVINGS. BUT 
WITH 'THE REF,' HE'S SET HIS SIGHTS HIGHER. IS AMERICA READY FOR DENIS LEARY, 
MOVIE STAR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WALKER, Michael Walker is a free-lance writer based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can smoke in the bar at the Hotel Nikko Beverly Hills, but almost nobody 
does. Except Denis Leary. That's him, slouching in a black-leather sofa over in 
the shadows, firing up another cigarette, ordering a platter of shrimp, the guy 
with the fine Irish features and drunken-altar-boy roll to his shoulders who, 
in this dim light, looks astonishingly like Bryan Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 Leary would hate the comparison. To his way of thinking, high-rotation rock 
stars like Adams and R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe should be rounded up and 
euthanized. In "No Cure for Cancer," Leary's breakthrough 1990 one-man show, 
the writer, actor and comedian seethed: "See that scar on my wrist? Know what 
that's from? I heard the Bee Gees were getting back together." Smoke and spit 
flying, Leary added: "We live in a country where John Lennon takes six bullets 
in the chest and Yoko Ono -- who's standing right next to him -- doesn't get 
one ? Stevie Ray Vaughan is dead and we can't get Jon Bon Jovi into a 
helicopter? Do we need a two-hour movie about the Doors? No, I can sum it up in 
five seconds: I'm drunk, I'm nobody; I'm drunk, I'm famous; I'm drunk, I'm 
dead." 
</P>
<P>
 "No Cure for Cancer," which Leary assembled while marooned in England after 
his wife, Ann Lembeck, went into premature labor there, created a sensation Off 
Broadway in 1991. The show spawned a book, a cable-TV special, an album for A&M 
Records and, indirectly, a series of 60-second spots for MTV in which Leary 
smoked, paced and raved about everything from Rodney G. King to Cindy Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, almost inevitably, the 36-year-old Leary, thwarted hockey player, former 
acting teacher, part-time house painter and reluctant stand-up comedian, the 
son of blue-collar Irish-American parents from Worcester, Mass., wants to 
establish himself in mainstream movies. It's a career path strewn -- literally 
-- with the bodies of comedian-cum-actors who went before him. For every Chevy 
Chase and Robin Williams, there's a John Belushi or a Sam Kinison -- 
fire-breathing comics in Leary's mold suffocated by Hollywood's commercial 
expectations. Even Eric Bogosian and Spalding Gray, theatrically grounded 
performance artists like Leary whose effortless irony and intelligence he 
approaches, have yet to make films that match the magnetism of their stage 
personae. 
</P>
<P>
 Leary, nevertheless, is trying, even if his film resume thus far is almost 
direct-to-video. He co-starred with Emilio Estevez in "Judgment Night," turned 
up in "The Sandlot" and "Demolition Man" and, earlier this year, in "Gunmen," a 
movie his publicists won't even list on his credits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes "The Ref," Leary's first starring vehicle, with its first-class cast 
(Judy Davis, Kevin Spacey), big-time executive producers (Jerry Bruckheimer and 
Don Simpson) and big-time expectations. With no bankable stars and a freshman 
director (Leary's close friend, Ted Demme, who directed the MTV spots), the 
movie, which opens Wednesday, rests squarely on Leary's shoulders.  
</P>
<P>
 Playing a cat burglar who takes hostage a bickering couple (Davis and Spacey), 
Leary delivers a variation on his suffer-no-fools MTV persona much the way 
Robin Williams riffed his way through "Good Morning, Vietnam." Although the 
role plays to Leary's comic strengths, it also brings him to the brink of 
type-casting. "The Ref" could be his breakthrough but it could also be a trap, 
and Leary knows it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having come from outside of films and wanting to get in, and knowing that 
that (MTV guy) image existed, I was concerned, because I didn't want to get 
stuck with it," he explains in his raspy Boston brogue, cigarette smoldering in 
the ashtray. "I also understand the reason you get cast in something is that 
they want what they've seen. Strangely enough, ('Ref' screenwriter) Richard 
LaGravenese was a guy I went to Emerson College (in Boston) with back in '78 
and never heard from again. He had written the script without thinking about me 
at all, but there was an element to the character that was recognizable as what 
people consider the MTV guy, which is why, quite frankly, they made the movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Theoretically, "The Ref" is the bridge that will take Leary, who appeared in 
productions at the Boston Shakespeare Company after graduating from Emerson in 
1979, to meatier, more serious roles. Leary cites Steve Martin, who deftly 
jettisoned his arrow-through-the-head "wild and crazy guy" and eventually 
became accepted as a credible actor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It becomes a matter of your attention span," he continues. "Doing the same 
character over and over, it gets boring. You end up like LeRoy Neiman. I mean, 
how many goddamn golf events can you go to and paint?" 
</P>
<P>
 "My gut feeling about Denis is, he can act," says Doug Herzog, MTV's senior 
vice president of programming, who attended Emerson with Leary. "He's obviously 
a comedian, but at the end of the day, he's an actor." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Michael Gruber, one of Leary's agents: "It's a weird Catch-22. Everybody 
who wants to be in business with Denis now are the people who wouldn't meet him 
two years ago, because he wasn't, in their eyes, an actor. Denis was always 
willing to prove he could act, but there are times that people just won't open 
their doors, especially to people coming out of the stand-up world. But look at 
Tom Hanks, Robin Williams -- nobody wanted to see them in a drama five years 
ago, and look at them now." 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, Disney has already green lighted the next Leary vehicle, "Two If 
by Sea," a comedy Leary wrote with writing partner Michael Armstrong. Also on 
deck is "Noose," a drama -- "funny, but in a very dark way" -- written by Leary 
and Armstrong with Leary's wife, Ann, supplying the story. Meanwhile, as Leary 
sinks ever deeper into Hollywood, the notes for his next one-man show, "Birth, 
School, Work, Death," molder in journals back in his apartment on New York's 
Upper West Side. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm actually looking forward to getting back to it -- it's almost a year now 
since I've been onstage," he says. "Bogosian just opened his new show in New 
York. I haven't seen that yet, but I know when I do I'm gonna come out juiced 
up and wanting to get back onstage." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leary has, one way or another, always been onstage. The younger of two sons in 
a family that included a pair of daughters, he quickly sized up his chances and 
became the pop-off kid. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother was a wild man," Leary recalls. "He was a very funny guy, but he 
was quieter than I was, and, generally speaking, there's never two wise-asses. 
Thinking back on it, I got away with a lot of stuff because my brother was so 
big. You could say something to somebody, and they'd want to hit you, but they 
couldn't because there was always this really big guy standing a couple of feet 
away who they knew was your brother." 
</P>
<P>
 Leary remembers his father, an Irish immigrant, as a devoted parent, if 
somewhat emotionally reserved. In "No Cure for Cancer," he recalled how during 
his brother's 10th birthday party, his father calmly walked in from the living 
room, where he had been cutting paneling with a circular saw, his thumb nearly 
severed. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'm thinking, 'Wow, Dad's thumb is hanging off. He's probably gonna start 
crying any second now.' And this is what my father says: 'We got any tape 
around here? I need to tape this baby up.' He wouldn't let my mother drive him 
to the hospital. That was too much a threat to his masculinity -- to be seen in 
a car driven by a woman. So he taped up his thumb with black electrical tape 
and drove himself to the hospital. I looked at my brother and said, 'Hey pal, 
forget about crying. We're never going to be able to cry about anything, ever. 
Our authority figure is a man who could cut his head off with a chain saw, and 
he'd staple-gun it back on.' " 
</P>

 "My dad was very much a John Wayne kind of guy," says Leary, "but he was also 
a great guy, great sense of humor, a real dedicated dad. I don't think he ever 
missed a hockey game I was in. Actually, I hope I raise my kids" -- a young son 
and daughter -- "the way my parents raised me, because they did a pretty good 
job. The most important thing, which we thought was normal, was that they were 
married for, God, 35 or 40 years. (Leary's father died in 1985 while visiting 
family in Ireland, two days after his 60th birthday.) We just assumed all 
families were like that. They scream and yell and grab food and fight at the 
table, but you don't lose anybody. Some people are in the penalty box, but 
they're always there. I think a lot of the problems people have are based on 
their parents walking away from their responsibilities, which is the easiest 
way out." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruminating on the recent Olympic soap opera, Leary says: "Tonya Harding's 
mother is married eight times. There's a picture of her mother in some magazine 
in a fur coat with a bird on her shoulder. I looked at that picture and that to 
me summed the whole thing up: Every time you come home there's a different dad 
and the same bird, y'know?" 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 At 17, Leary was ensconced in parochial high school, tabulating his limited 
options. "I wasn't the best student," he admits. "I wasn't stupid, but I wasn't 
paying a lot of attention. By then, I knew I wasn't going to play professional 
sports because I just wasn't good enough. I knew I wanted to write or act. I'm 
really happy I went to a Catholic school because a lot of the repressive 
tactics they use make for great senses of humor. You're always laughing your 
ass off when you're not supposed to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Leary left the family home in Worcester and enrolled at Emerson, studying 
acting, where he met Steven Wright and a clutch of other young comics who would 
soon burst out of Boston onto the national scene. Leary, though, was the big 
man on campus. "What I remember about Denis, at Emerson, was that he was like a 
celebrity," says MTV's Herzog, "just enough arrogance to make it work." 
</P>
<P>
 After graduation, Leary returned to Emerson to teach comedy writing and 
improvisation. "It was just 10 of us in a room going over work, so it wasn't 
really like I was teaching . . . but for two hours every third day, you had a 
place where you could go even though you were driving a pizza delivery truck or 
working in a chemical plant, and it would just be all about this creative 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he was breaking into Boston's comedy scene in his own bullheaded 
fashion. Rather than submit completely to the vicissitudes of the clubs, he 
booked his own room and presented stand-up, sketches and song parodies. "When 
you're a young comic, you're lucky to get on once every two weeks," says Paul 
Barclay, owner of Boston's Comedy Connection, who booked Leary early on. "If 
you have your own space, you're it. Every Saturday night, he could do his own 
show." 
</P>
<P>
 Stand-up, in any event, was problematic, because Leary refused to edit his 
scatology-heavy material. "It was hard to get him work," says Barclay. "He'd 
play a middle-age crowd the same as a college crowd. He was good, funny, but he 
decided, no matter what, not to compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 Leary finally moved to New York, working the downtown clubs where he could let 
his material roam as far afield from standards of decorum as he pleased. In 
March, 1990, he flew to London with his pregnant wife to appear on the BBC 
television show "Paramount City." The show was scheduled for Saturday night; on 
Saturday morning, Denis and Ann's son, Jack, was born 12 weeks prematurely. 
With a wife and son conscripted by doctors not to leave England for five 
months, Leary stumbled into an invitation to present a one-man show at the 
Edinburgh International Arts Festival. The show, "No Cure for Cancer," was a 
hit, moved to London's West End, and then to New York, where Ted Demme, then 
the director of "Yo! MTV Raps," caught it and had an epiphany. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything he said was something I was feeling or wanted to say," recalls 
Demme. "I called him the next day and said, 'You may or may not know who I am, 
but I need to talk to you.' " Over burgers, Demme told Leary, "Listen, I think 
we could do something funny." Two weeks later, they were shooting Leary's first 
pace-and-smoke spots for MTV. For good or ill, the MTV guy was born. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Back at the Nikko's bar, Leary is smoking his umpteenth cigarette, marveling 
at the calibrations of his favorite writers. (Leary himself writes an 
occasional column for Details magazine -- "a totally low-maintenance writer," 
says his editor, Joe Dolce. "His great skill is poking fun at everybody and not 
insulting anybody -- he's angry, but not mean-spirited.")  
</P>
<P>
 There's Ian Frazier's New Yorker piece about Wyle E. Coyote suing the Acme 
company -- "I had to stop, like, five times to laugh out loud, which you almost 
never do when you're reading." There's Albert Brooks -- "He's one of those 
guys, I own all his movies, I can pop in a scene for the 40th time and just die 
laughing." 
</P>
<P>
 Leary's taste is telling, and speaks well of the sturdiness of his own 
writing. Unlike many young comics, he knows the difference between jokes and 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could never write a joke," Leary declares. "I can't tell a joke. I can tell 
stories. Where I grew up, it was always funny stories -- the Irish thing, very 
oral. Humor always came out of the funny things that this guy did, or the funny 
thing that happened to this character. Jokes are great, they're terrific -- 
Steve Wright's jokes are almost abstract, like haiku. But humor, the real deep 
laugh, comes from reality and character and situation.  
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that made 'The Honeymooners,' which to me is like American 
Shakespeare, wasn't the jokes. It was the situation and the people. Same with 
the Seinfeld show and Albert Brooks: There are memorable lines, quotable tracts 
of dialogue, but it all comes from the situation.' 
</P>
<P>
 It's one reason Leary never cared much for stand-up. "I eventually realized I 
ended writing ('No Cure') because I was frustrated and I knew I was never going 
to hit these zanies and funny bones," he says. "Which was fine, because 
everybody I knew who was doing stand-up was coming back like a Vietnam vet. My 
friends had these horror stories -- you're stuck in a comedy condo with some 
juggler in Ohio after the show, and there's nothing to do and you're trying to 
just watch TV and go to sleep, and the juggler is like, 'Hey man! Watch this!' 
And he's juggling oranges, and you're part of his act. I'd be in a prison right 
now in Ohio. Guys would be going, 'I killed my parents and chopped up my wife. 
What did you do?' And I'd say, 'I lit this juggler on fire a week ago in a 
comedy club.' 
</P>
<P>
 Leary stubs out his last cigarette. "I can't," he says, with some gravity, 
"live in a comedy condo. Y'know?"

EXPATRIATE GAMES; FED UP WITH HOLLYWOOD, OSCAR-WINNING SCREENWRITER STIRLING 
SILLIPHANT MOVED TO THAILAND TO ESCAPE THE POSTURING AND POWER PLAYS. BUT THE 
VERY THINGS HE FLED FOLLOWED HIM THERE WHEN HE WROTE A MOVIE FOR TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stirling Silliphant, a fixture in the entertainment industry for three 
decades, disappeared from Hollywood six years ago. He was one of the industry's 
most prolific screenwriters, winning an Academy Award for 1967's "In the Heat 
of the Night," the racial thriller starring Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the service of profit-hungry studio executives, he also churned out 
lots of commercial action films -- from the so-called blaxploitation movie 
"Shaft in Africa" to director Sam Peckinpah's violent "The Killer Elite" -- and 
campy Irwin Allen disaster epics such as "The Poseidon Adventure" and "The 
Towering Inferno." 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, Silliphant grew tired of the power plays, the egos, the 
hypocrisy and the dictum that homage must be paid to the box office. In 1987, a 
dispute with Sylvester Stallone over screen credit for the championship 
arm-wrestling saga "Over the Top" finally pushed Silliphant himself over the 
top. He sold two houses, six cars and a yacht and moved to his favorite 
vacation spot, Thailand, where the culture and Buddhism held a fascination for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't come here on a fling but to change my whole existence, my 
personality, my understanding of life, and to leave what I call the eel pit of 
Hollywood behind," the graying expatriate said last spring, sitting in a Trader 
Vic's here on the bank of the massive Chao Phraya River and gazing outward at 
the low-slung boats and barges passing by. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it feels so good to be part of the human stream, and not some Hollywood 
big shot who worries about what table he gets at Jimmy's and won't let the 
parking attendant touch his $80,000 Mercedes. That seems so far away now. 
That's not the way we're supposed to live." 
</P>
<P>
 In Thailand, where the American dollar is strong, the people are gracious and 
the land is largely unspoiled, Silliphant had a vision. Using local crew and 
talent, he wanted to turn Bangkok, along with the rest of Southeast Asia, into 
a burgeoning production center for English-language TV projects and feature 
films that would be distributed internationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Little did he suspect that with his first effort, the problems he associated 
with working in Hollywood would track him down, 8,271 miles away: A star, Fred 
Dryer, got involved, rewrote the script and, in Silliphant's view, ruined his 
vision. The resulting TV movie, "Day of Reckoning," airs Monday at 9 p.m. on 
NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen a video of the final version," Silliphant, 76, said in another 
interview last week. "I do not like it. My distaste stems not from whether the 
work is good, bad or indifferent. The critics and viewers will soon enough make 
their own decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is simply that it is not the film I envisioned, the film about which I 
felt a driving passion and a long-held visionary hope -- finally to capture 
something, even a hint, of what it is like to be an American expatriate living 
in Thailand. The final result, to me, is a film assembled by committee, a 
script hammered flat by executive fiat." 
</P>
<P>
 Dryer disagrees. The action-filled NBC series "Hunter" turned the onetime Los 
Angeles Ram into a star with worldwide clout after it was syndicated in 90 or 
so countries, becoming the most-watched TV program in China at one point. The 
changes Dryer made in "Day of Reckoning" were to give his fans what he believes 
they expect in his first acting assignment since "Hunter" ended production 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The project couldn't have turned out better," he said of "Day of Reckoning," 
in a recent telephone interview from Colorado while on vacation with his 
daughter. "We think we have a real good piece." 
</P>
<P>
 "Day of Reckoning," produced as a potential TV-movie franchise for NBC, tells 
the tale of an American Special Forces captain who moves to Bangkok after the 
Vietnam War. He becomes a Buddhist and a rogue travel guide, specializing in 
expeditions to remote and dangerous locations in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Silliphant and his Los Angeles partner, actor Robert Ginty, spent a year 
trying to raise $1.5 million to produce "Day of Reckoning" themselves. But the 
two farongs , or foreigners, couldn't entice Thai investors. Ginty was going to 
star as Jack O'Brien, the lead character, but wasn't a big enough name. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more significant, the once-buzzing film industry has grown anemic in 
Thailand, where a big-budget movie might cost $400,000, compared to $25 million 
or more for an American film. Flashy products from Hollywood and nearby Hong 
Kong have almost killed the industry, keeping smaller, local Thai productions 
out of the few theater chains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most Thai investors would still rather fill a swamp and put up buildings than 
back a film," said Silliphant, who began writing in the late 1950s on such 
acclaimed TV series as the police drama "Naked City" and the road show "Route 
66." 
</P>
<P>
 So Ginty took the project to Paramount in Hollywood. As Silliphant tells it, 
Ginty signed the rights away before Silliphant could object. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The next thing I knew, it had gone from Paramount to Fred Dryer to NBC, and 
suddenly we had a deal," Silliphant said last spring when "Day of Reckoning" 
was still in production. As Silliphant sat sipping his tropical drink in Trader 
Vic's, filming was taking place several hundred yards away in the luxurious 
lobby of the Royal Garden Riverside hotel. He was available for consultation, 
but he was so disheartened that he wouldn't appear on the set. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I heard this, I was not only unhappy, I was very upset," Silliphant 
continued. "And what I knew would happen has happened. Number one, the budget 
went from $1.5 to $4 million. And number two, we totally lost control of the 
project. We sold the house. And then it went into the Hollywood system. What is 
the Hollywood system? The Hollywood system is to come to a place like this and 
just use it as a background." 
</P>
<P>
 He gestured out the hotel window to the Chao Phraya -- a busy waterway of 
commerce and trade in Bangkok and the best way to avoid the snarling traffic 
jams that transform stifling city streets into a virtual parking lot during the 
day. Along the exotic green shores, beautiful resort hotels stand between 
rotting, wooden dwellings where naked children play in dirty water. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's not what I intended," Silliphant said. "What we're getting is 
money. Period. We're not getting what we set out to do -- which is to control 
the film, to invest it with the culture and the attitudes of Thailand, to make 
an essentially Thai-produced film. I felt a sense of great personal failure, 
having said 'Screw off' five years ago, 'I don't need you bastards.' Here I was 
back selling them something, and it was a total denial of everything I wanted 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Silliphant said he bears no resentment toward Ginty, who ended up with a 
supporting role in "Day of Reckoning" as Dryer's partner in his travel 
business, Eco Tours. Ginty said he was simply fed up with shopping the movie 
around when he made the deal with Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen this development process go on for years, having worked in 
independent films," Ginty said. "But you've got to get it made. You can talk 
about it forever. There are guys out there in Morton's who are constantly 
talking about it, and guys in Spago constantly talking about it. I got 
impatient. I wasn't going to wait any longer, because I knew it would sell. 
Between Stirling's name and this location, I knew the story would sell." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Early last year, the plans Dryer carefully devised for his career were 
collapsing like a house of cards. When "Hunter" was nearing the end of its 
seven-year run on NBC, Dryer signed a three-year contract at Paramount with 
Brandon Tartikoff, who had recently resigned as chairman of NBC Entertainment 
to run the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 One brainchild of Tartikoff's was to put popular TV stars, who are seen in 
living rooms across America in tens of millions of households, into moderately 
budgeted movies and watch the cash roll in. Dryer was poised to launch his 
feature-film career in a movie called "And Justice for One." 
</P>
<P>
 But before the cameras were ready to roll, Tartikoff abruptly left Paramount, 
Sherry Lansing replaced him, and she put Dryer's film into turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brandon loved the movie, and he wanted to do it," said Dryer, 48. "We had it 
all ready to go and then he left. When he did, the impending storm hit us: the 
new regime. And they said, 'We're not interested. We're not interested in you, 
and we're not interested in the project.' I was pretty much dead in the water 
theatrically." 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount's television division tried desperately to get Dryer to do a TV 
series, either a half-hour comedy or an hour drama. But he refused, choosing 
instead to focus his energy on developing his own production company. If he was 
going to star in television, he wanted to produce and own the programming, 
making sure it could play in foreign markets to address his huge overseas 
following. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do know that television drives the world," Dryer said. "It's a software 
business, and those who have a library to supply that need in the coming years 
will be the ones in good shape. I want to be a part of that future." 
</P>
<P>
 That's when "Day of Reckoning" was presented to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Paramount would own "Day of Reckoning," the internationally flavored 
production offered Dryer a solid first project for his new company to produce 
and supply to NBC, where he has a three-movie deal. Dryer became executive 
producer, along with his partner, Victor Schiro. 
</P>
<P>
 The pairing of Silliphant and Dryer seemed a natural. In "Hunter," Dryer 
played a maverick cop with a female partner, incompetent superiors and a 
massive Magnum revolver. "Hunter" was crafted after Clint Eastwood's successful 
"Dirty Harry" movies, specifically "The Enforcer," the only one to pair 
Eastwood with a female partner. Silliphant wrote "The Enforcer." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dryer didn't share Silliphant's vision of "Day of Reckoning." Dryer 
changed much of Silliphant's script before he arrived in Asia, collaborating 
uneasily with Silliphant by fax to avoid costly phone bills. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There really was no story there before," Dryer said. "It was about a guy who 
lived out on a rice barge in front of the hotel. He had a travel agency, with 
these slow-turning fans, and a lot of women taking care of him. He was a 
typical American expatriate who lives in Asia for specific womanizing reasons, 
and he was very sexist. It was very deprecating to the Thais. I brought in a 
guy who's there because he has found a place in the world that fits him." 
</P>
<P>
 Silliphant denies there were any sexist aspects to his original story. From 
his viewpoint, Dryer "slashed and burned" all of the subtleties in his script, 
all of the dialogue that wasn't of the "let's go" variety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw all the grace notes and textures of the writing and characterizations 
vanish one by one -- the dialogue reduced to easy banality or to strong, silent 
looks; the story line pounded into an A-B-C linear form," Silliphant said. 
"There may still be two scenes left in the entire two-hour movie in which some 
hint, some faint luster of the original writing, may be sensed." 
</P>
<P>
 Dryer explained his approach: "I have a pretty good sense of who I am and what 
I want to do. I know my limitations. I know what I'm capable of doing. And I 
know what people want to see. So I took the germ of the idea and just started 
restructuring it. It's no longer a closed mystery; it was before. Everything 
was very veiled. It was tough to follow. Now it's just straight on. Everything 
is out in the open. You get to see the bad guys and you can follow it easily." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did Dryer feel comfortable relying heavily on the Thai film industry's 
infrastructure for technical support, as Silliphant had in mind. A 
multinational crew came in from London, Hong Kong and the United States for 
filming last spring in Bangkok and the jungle mountains of Krabi to the south. 
The entire project was overseen by a contingent of Hollywood "suits" -- studio 
executives at Paramount and network executives at NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, this oil-and-water mix cost us at least $1 million more than 
it should have had we been able to shoot with a 95% Thai crew and not whip into 
the mix Brits, Yanks and Hong Kong Chinese," Silliphant said. 
</P>
<P>
 Filming wrapped in June. After an inordinately long post-production period, 
NBC announced an air date last month. Even the title of the movie was changed 
at the last minute because the original title, "The Wisdom Keeper," tested 
poorly with audiences and didn't have "enough punch," as Dryer put it. 
</P>
<P>
 Dryer blamed part of the post-production delays on a Thai script supervisor 
who did not properly catalogue the thousands of feet of film that were shot. 
Silliphant blamed it on the continuing divisiveness of the separate cliques 
pulling at the final production like taffy: Paramount, NBC, Dryer's production 
company and British director Brian Grant. Neither NBC nor Paramount would make 
anyone available to comment on the final version that airs Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Silliphant found the entire experience to be "depressing, 
dispiriting, debilitating," calling "Day of Reckoning" the "most degrading 
period of my career." The expatriate character of Jack O'Brien still holds 
untapped potential for Silliphant. He would consider getting involved if NBC 
wants to turn the movie into a regular franchise, but he doesn't believe that's 
likely to happen after all the hassles. 
</P>
<P>
 Silliphant still maintains his dream of establishing a production mecca in 
Southeast Asia. He's currently networking wealthy Thais for investors, and he's 
writing a screenplay called "Forever," to be directed in Thailand by one of the 
country's leading directors, Prince Chatrichalerm Yugala. This time Silliphant 
will work without help from Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that bothers me about America is the American insular point of 
view," he said. "Our refusal to learn languages. Our refusal to really look 
around and see this is one big world. . . . We are so absolutely insulated -- 
and Hollywood, in particular. We're like in a shell. We're like the crab. We 
scuttle around on the rocks but we can't break out of the shell to realize this 
is a huge world. And there are wonderful films to be made." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their differences, Dryer sounds like Silliphant in some ways: "I left 
the studio system, and I'm on my own. I have autonomy now, and I have an 
opportunity to enter into television and all the projects I do as a free 
agent." 
</P>
<P>
 Dryer won't rule out working as an actor for hire -- apparently plans are 
under way with NBC and producer Stephen J. Cannell to do a "Hunter" TV movie. 
And Dryer would play O'Brien again, if called upon. But Dryer said he will make 
his priority Fred Dryer Productions, where he has a motion picture and several 
TV projects in development. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to address a world market," he said. "People here know who I am 
because of television, and people around the world in 94 countries know who I 
am because of it. I want to attack the world theatrical market with 
smaller-budget features, and then come back in a television project on a world 
level that is right for me. When I do, I will own that. I'm looking for 
ownership, not fees. I want to establish a company that's in it for the long 
haul."

HUGH GRANT IS VEDDY VEDDY BUSY; THE 33-YEAR-OLD ACTOR MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE 
NEXT GREAT BRITISH ROMANTIC LEADING MAN -- REMEMBER CARY? -- BUT HE'S WORKING 
ON IT WITH THREE NEW FILMS, INCLUDING 'FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A British leading man who has the fair features to turn young girls' and aging 
matrons' knees wobbly; the graceful, spot-on diction that suggests breeding 
commensurate with beauty; the urbane quick-wittedness that cements the 
intellectual desirability . . .  
</P>
<P>
 . . . but who also, all-importantly, counterbalances all that perfection with 
a nervous self-deprecation, or befuddlement even, that makes him a dashing yet 
daffy Everyman, unthreateningly endearing to even the least secure heterosexual 
male. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like a Grant, all right.  
</P>
<P>
 Mention to Hugh Grant, though, that some have suggested he might be the 
rightful successor to Cary as the first real romantic-comedic leading man from 
England to hit big here in decades and he does precisely what you'd want an 
ingenuously modest Brit to do: demur. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does a romantic leading man still exist, though, in the cinema today? Discuss 
in not more than 500 words," he says, doubtfully reposing the question. "If we 
were still in the '50s or '60s . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 If we were still in the '50s or '60s, Grant's star might already have risen. 
The odds aren't terribly lopsided in the '90s, at that. The sleeper comedy 
that's causing all the commotion, director Mike Newell's "Four Weddings and a 
Funeral," opens Wednesday, and offers Grant, 33, his first true leading role in 
a film that has any likelihood of breaking out beyond the art-house circuit. 
The sweet, sharp farce has him striking up romance with Andie MacDowell in a 
circuitous route that takes the tentative couple through a "meet-cute" times 
five, encompassing all the title ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 He also shares star billing in two other pictures opening in Los Angeles in 
the next two weeks, albeit in far less sexy, more reactionary parts. He plays 
the prototypical repressed Brit in two international productions -- John 
Duigan's "Sirens," also opening Wednesday, and Roman Polanski's controversial 
"Bitter Moon," which opened in Europe a year and a half ago but finally hits 
here March 18. 
</P>
<P>
 These round out the inadvertent homage au Hugh Grant , as he puts it, and make 
him very probably the only actor going with four feature films out at once -- 
considering that he's still on screens with his small part in "The Remains of 
the Day," as the grown godson whom Anthony Hopkins strives to teach about the 
birds, the bees and fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Off-screen as well as on, those charmed by Grant most often mention his 
likably self-effacing quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm gonna get rid of that," he announces, suddenly, when the subject comes 
up. "I'm going to efface my self-effacing quality, I've decided. It's not a 
good idea in Hollywood. Too often I've said, 'Oh no, no, please, it's a 
terrible film, I'm awful in it,' and people have taken me at my word, which is 
not what they're supposed to do at all. They're supposed to shout me down and 
say, 'On the contrary, it's excellent, and you're wonderful!"' 
</P>
<P>
 Grant's longtime girlfriend, British actress Elizabeth Hurley, who currently 
lives in L.A., "is furious with me when I do that, furious ," he says. "But I 
can't believe how people don't do it here. I've had lunches with people I've 
never met before where they'll say just in passing, 'Yeah, I made a film two 
years ago which got 14 awards and was called the most exciting film since 
"Jurassic Park," ' he says, marveling at the gaucheness of it all. "Just in 
passing they'll blow their own trumpet like that, and maybe that's what you 
have to do, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it is amazing how many. . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I just want you to know I won the best actor prize in the Venice Film 
Festival in 1986," he interrupts. (It was for his debut lead in 
Merchant-Ivory's "Maurice.") "Anyway, do go on." 
</P>
<P>
 . . . is amazing, as we were saying, how many unsolicited verbal resumes one 
collects in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I think that's what gives me the creeps a bit here, actually, because I 
see too much of myself in the people around me, the self-obsession," Grant 
says. "Conversations you have here, it is literally just 'my turn to talk about 
myself, your turn to talk about yourself, my turn' -- and there's no contact, 
no one has any interest in anyone else at all unless they can. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 He suddenly hushes. "This is terrible. This is the L.A. Times! What am I 
doing? What am I doing? I love Hollywood. I've liked everyone I've met," he 
says, the rather unconvincing last bit muffled by his burying his face in his 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
 He really isn't the first person to have noticed it, we point out, trying to 
be reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I know, but it sounds terrible coming from a foreigner. I would hate any 
foreigner who had the audacity to criticize one single thing about London." 
</P>
<P>
 And -- as someone who prefers to carry on a bi-continental love affair rather 
than do something so unnatural as resist the "strange impulse to base myself 
where I'm to be indigenous" -- he means it. Grant complains with a resigned 
bemusement that one question he seems to get from a lot of American journalists 
is: "You're very British, aren't you?" Stupid or apocryphal as the question 
might be, you can kind of see where it's coming from. 
</P>

<P>
 At the '94 Sundance Film Festival in Utah, Hugh Grant, the toast of the 
festival, is learning to schmooze in a big-time way. Here, "Four Weddings and a 
Funeral" was the opening-night premiere and "Sirens" also had its stateside 
debut; the buzz on Grant is prompting a lot of glad-handing on the snowy 
streets, with many a glove or mitten extended in instant friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a beautiful Hollywood-in-Park-City scene happening as Grant puts on 
his winter parka and bids adieu to Elle MacPherson, who is dressed unseasonably 
in a remarkable skintight bodysuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Missing you already," Grant coos to MacPherson, blowing a kiss as he exits, 
eliciting a good super-model laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 This affectation is an inside joke between the "Sirens" co-stars, adopted from 
one of Grant's earlier festival encounters. Indulging in such mockery seems to 
be his way of shielding himself from the pressure of being buttered up as a 
golden boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly I have been schmoozed, and although I'm cynical about it now, 
there's a huge side of one which is drinking it in thinking, 'Yes, how right 
you are, I am a huge star.' And I don't want to be disappointed," he admits, 
sitting down inside a nearby ski-town coffeehouse. "I know that people do talk 
you up a hell of a lot in Hollywood -- I've had it to a smaller extent before 
-- and you don't want to come crashing down. And although I can't pretend I'm 
not excited when they say it, I realize that I ought to take it with a really 
big pinch of salt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met a person the other day from Hollywood -- I'd known them for literally 
one minute -- and when I said goodby, they said, 'Missing you already.' And, 
uh, that couldn't be true." 
</P>
<P>
 To be fair, folks can't be blamed for feeling endeared to Grant after seeing 
"Four Weddings and a Funeral," though he insists he's not nearly so nice as the 
character on screen. Variety, for instance, has come out with the film's first 
review during Sundance, a rave that says, "Grant's got just the combination of 
good looks, rueful self-disparagement, quickness and bespectacled nerdiness to 
carry off refined, sophisticated screen comedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant saw the film for the first time himself at the festival premiere, and 
says he breathed a huge sigh of relief. "I don't think in many ways it was a 
perfect first time to see it, because although Salt Lake City's a lovely place, 
that particular audience was quite full of middle-aged religious people, and 
the first nine words of the film were 'f---'. A few people left quite near the 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understood the script because I have the same sort of background as the 
screenwriter, Richard Curtis, and used to do quite a lot of comedy myself, and 
knew exactly where all the beats and all the timing should be. And Mike Newell 
was directing very deliberately against the natural sort of comic beats. So I 
panicked and thought, 'Are we making it too serious?' 
</P>
<P>
 "But watching it, I realized he was doing exactly the right thing. In a comic 
scene Newell makes you play the truth, and to hell with any timing, to hell 
with comedy, as if we'll let that take care of itself. And although that made 
me nervous when we were playing it, I see now he was right." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the character, "There are elements of the thing which are me -- like 
the chaos in my life, and I suppose to a certain extent being 33 and not being 
married and worrying about it a bit," he says. "But the niceness is not really 
me, no. When people like that character, they're really liking Richard, the 
screenwriter. I think I'm a nastier piece of work." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Newell, surprisingly enough, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe him," Newell says by transatlantic phone, laughing. "He is, of 
course, two people. And one of the sides that made both of us very nervous was 
that he has a very cool side to him, a side that observes with irony and 
candor, and not necessarily kindness, either. He's a very bright man, and he 
sees people's foibles and mannerisms very clearly, and you can sometimes see 
his eyebrow cocking at these things, and you just know that something 
devastating and witty and not necessarily kind is about to come out of his 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, there is also that kind of shaggy Irish 'Oh God, another piece dropped 
off me and I'm terribly sorry' charm to him, and it was a matter of emphasis, 
bringing on one and keeping back the other. Oddly enough, I'm working with him 
again now on a new film where that polarity is exactly reversed. I want the 
cruel side of him and I don't want all that lovely, raffish charm." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In most of his films, though, Grant hasn't been raffish or cruel -- just 
constricted. 
</P>
<P>
 He was typecast to the point that a recent Los Angeles magazine review of 
"Bitter Moon" referred to the actor as "perpetual twit Hugh Grant." That 
perception might not have been entirely unreasonable based on the handful of 
Grant's films that have made it to the United States. His starring 
breakthrough, "Maurice," had him as a troubled young man slowly coming to terms 
with his homosexuality in the 1910s; his next major film, "Impromptu," was a 
bit more of a romp, but even there, as the ever-sickly composer Chopin, he was 
more an unwilling foil for Judy Davis' wiles. 
</P>
<P>
 And two of the three films opening this month have him quite repressed. 
"Sirens" features Grant as a 1930s Anglican priest who visits a painter of 
nudes, Sam Neill, to try to convince him to tone down his work, only to find 
his very proper minister's wife drawn into the local sexual experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Bitter Moon," he's an all-too-proper Brit on a cruise ship who's repelled 
yet captivated by Peter Coyote's tales of sexual abandon, his wife again 
resorting to lurid satisfaction in another cabin. 
</P>
<P>
 With "Four Weddings," though, Grant's days as a mostly reactionary presence in 
films may be through, as he gets offered parts a little closer to his own dry 
screwball charisma or the Newell film's joie de vivre . 
</P>
<P>
 Duigan, the "Sirens" director, believes one of Grant's most exploitable 
qualities is "his ability to laugh at himself, and in a way that perhaps not 
all that many current actors can. He's very open about humorous things that 
have happened to him; minor humiliations, he quite relishes actually talking 
about, whereas most people would probably keep them under wraps." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Los Angeles a few weeks after the Sundance Festival, Grant is holed up 
at the Four Seasons Hotel, and isn't keeping his frustration under wraps. The 
second Newell film, "An Awfully Big Adventure," has been confirmed as a go in 
the interim, and he's been rehearsing himself for the Dublin shoot in his 
suite. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get a role, there's that terrible sort of fear, am I gonna be able 
to do it or not? I've been laughing like a maniac in this room for the past two 
days. I think the maids are quite wondering about me. He's got a laugh, this 
character, and they describe it. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant picks up the script and reads: "'Meredith laughs his attractive, open, 
nervous bray of a laugh, which -- little to do with his real character -- 
seduces. Using it, he enslaves impressionable people."' 
</P>
<P>
 Says a frustrated Grant, "Could you give me an 'attractive, open, nervous bray 
of a laugh'? A bray is what a donkey does, right? Hee-haw. But what's an 
attractive bray of a laugh? I can't f---ing do that!" 
</P>
<P>
 In "An Awfully Big Adventure," a comedy-drama based on a Beryl Bainbridge 
novel, Grant is cast rather against type as the "absolutely vile" antagonist, a 
charismatic regional theater director in 1946 Liverpool who, being both nasty 
and gay, inspires the very misplaced crush of a naive teen-aged actress. (Alan 
Rickman is also cast unusually, as the hero.) 
</P>
<P>
 Grant is spending the rest of his hours in the Four Seasons reading through 
the dozens of scripts that his new American agent has been collecting since the 
Sundance buzz. 
</P>
<P>
 He resists questions about his "stock," but is prepared for it to rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only place where they really adore me right now is Japan, where I think 
for some reason they have a thing about English gentlemen. After 'Maurice' came 
out, I got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of letters with lovely origami 
dragons and Japanese sweaters and things like that. There's a whole book in 
Japan called 'Hugh Grant Vol. 1,' and now there's a 'Hugh Grant Vol. 2' coming 
out -- which I just had translated, and it's a very astute work . . . how I 
like to eat when I'm relaxing. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I got a script from Japan actually the other day. The translation wasn't 
quite as good as it could have been. It began, 'A worker is making a hole in a 
statue with a dribble' -- which I assume is meant to be a drill. And then it 
said, 'Peter enter' -- Peter is my character -- 'he shout, "Stot, stot, give me 
the dribble." ' And it was tempting in a way to do it, without having it 
retranslated. 
</P>
<P>
 "But do you know, they're tailing off. How dare they? When I got back from 
Sundance to London, there were not nearly enough Japanese letters, not nearly. 
I think I'm a bit long in the tooth for them, actually. I've since discovered a 
lot of my presents never got to me. My (former) agent intercepted them. I 
thought I'd seen him in Japanese jumpers and that beautiful origami mobile 
hanging in his office . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "And yes, disappointingly few fan letters from the rest of the world. Only 
nutters, really, strictly speaking. There are a few maniac kind of waiters or 
something who say, 'Hey, "Lair of the White Worm," great movie, man,' and then 
you know that they're about to go off to McDonald's and machine-gun a hundred 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Grant has the same doubts about marriage as fame. He implies that he and 
Hurley may soon start living together again -- probably on home turf, given his 
proud nationalism -- but very much shares the hesitancy of his "Four Weddings" 
character to jump into matrimony. He also shares his movie persona's 
philosophical uneasiness about being single, though it's not easy to cut 
through the cheekiness on these more personal subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 "You start to feel a little bit strange, don't you -- I mean, most of my 
friends from Oxford now have got paired off. A few, I'm delighted to see, are 
getting divorced. It cheers one up no end, if you have been worried about 'is 
there something wrong with me? Why am I not married?' 
</P>
<P>
 "Did I tell you my views on marriage? About the Von Trapp marriage and 'The 
Sound of Music'? This is my dream of a nice marriage: to be in a big schloss , 
with enough space so that you and your wife can avoid each other, with a lot of 
servants to bring the children down, in sailor suits, preferably in step, at 6 
o'clock in the evening, have a quick look at them and then send them off to bed 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I cannot seem to envision myself living in a nice semi-detached house in 
South London with two squawling children on the floor with all those hideous 
toys that they seem to have now. I can't bear those horrid primary colors -- 
they're really offensive."

IS IT THEATER? IS IT RADIO? DOES IT MATTER?; WHEN HER PLAY-PRODUCING DREAMS 
EVAPORATED, SUSAN LOEWENBERG PUT A NEW SPIN ON A DIFFERENT MEDIUM, WINNING 
PRAISE -- AND A FEW JEERS -- FOR HER SUCCESS

 Unless you work at the Music Center's Mark Taper Forum, the chances of making 
a viable full-time career in the theater in Los Angeles are right up there with 
crossing the Mojave Desert on foot in August, or maybe jumping off the 
Hollywood sign and landing in the arms of Madonna. One who has beaten these 
odds is Susan Albert Loewenberg, a former actress-turned-producer who after 
years of little victories and big losses on the city's small stages has found 
herself the impresario of the nation's leading contemporary radio drama series, 
"The Play's the Thing," broadcast regularly as part of the weekly "KCRW 
Playhouse" over KCRW-FM (89.9). 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't plan this, but look what's happened," says Loewenberg, whose success 
on the radio has been unlikely, ingenious and, in a sense, double-sided. It 
emerged from the failure of her nonprofit L.A. Classic Theatre Works in the 
late '80s to mount a stage production using the members of the high-profile 
repertory company she assembled with former producing partner Judith 
Auberjonois. 
</P>
<P>
 The two turned to the radio initially in 1987 as a short-term compromise with 
their bigger dream, but when plans for the repertory company eventually were 
shelved, the radio productions became the main event, growing into a current 
season of 18 full-length plays read by top Hollywood talent (Jason Robards, 
Annette Bening, James Earl Jones, Amy Irving, Tim Robbins) and recorded before 
paying audiences in a 300-seat ballroom at the Guest Quarters Suite Hotel in 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The plays are broadcast Saturday (and sometimes Sunday) evenings at 6:30 on 
KCRW, and selectively around the country on National Public Radio, and in 
England on the BBC. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Loewenberg has expanded her operations into the theater 
communities of Chicago and Boston, producing a series of radio dramas there in 
partnership with leading local companies like the Goodman and the American 
Repertory Theatre. These shows are later heard here on "KCRW Playhouse," as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 She has accomplished this, supporting a full-time staff of five with an annual 
budget of about $400,000, in a period that has seen the collapse of the Los 
Angeles Theatre Center and the dissipation of the not-for-profit theater scene 
under recessionary pressures. Loewenberg has stayed afloat on grants from Arco, 
the National Endowment for the Arts, the California Arts Council and others, 
but she has also hit upon a novel idea: that people would pay theater prices 
(up to $20 a ticket) to watch stars and other leading actors read plays aloud 
in front of a microphone. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, she has been able to snag the cooperation of the stars, 
generally so reluctant to appear onstage in Los Angeles, because these "live in 
performance" radio productions allow them to indulge their interest in theater 
while spending only a few days away from their movie and television careers -- 
unlike the two or three months required to do a play at the Taper or another 
resident theater. Most of the radio plays are performed and taped on three 
successive nights and edited later for broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent productions (scheduled for broadcast later this spring) include Noel 
Coward's "Fallen Angels," with Bening, Judith Ivey and Joe Mantegna; Alan 
Ayckbourn's "Man of the Moment," with Martin Jarvis and Rosalind Ayres, and 
satirist Harry Shearer's new musical "J. Edgar," about J. Edgar Hoover, 
starring Kelsey Grammer and John Goodman. 
</P>
<P>
 The productions are budgeted at $20,000 apiece, a cost that, on paper, would 
almost be covered by ticket revenue alone. The actors, as a rule, receive tiny 
honorariums; Guest Quarters provides the performance space and KCRW the air 
time and promotion. There are post-production expenses, marketing costs and the 
administrative cost of L.A. Theatre Works itself, which maintains an office in 
Venice and also runs a workshop for women playwrights and arts programs for 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the financially strapped theater world of 1994, Loewenberg's formula for 
survival would seem to be inventive and admirable, although there remains the 
issue of the medium in which she has survived. That is, is anyone listening? 
</P>
<P>
 Is radio drama a real force in either radio or the theater? Or are these 
productions, seen by a total audience of no more than 900 people each, more 
like a pleasant boutique in which our best actors are laying down recordings 
for storage in libraries -- an excuse for them not to have to make a real 
commitment to the stage in this studio city? 
</P>
<P>
 Loewenberg has her critics in the local theater community, and these are some 
of the questions raised when her name comes up. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's the only person in Los Angeles theater who's been making a salary for 
20 years, and she's never had a space," says, with some exaggeration, a 
skeptical fellow producer who asked not to be named. "How did she do it? 
Everybody knows she's a brilliant grant-getter and entrepreneur." 
</P>
<P>
 She is no stranger to controversy and in the past has herself been a vocal 
critic of the Music Center and LATC, of theater in Los Angeles in general. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no self-producing Equity theaters between 200 and 900 seats except 
the Taper and the Pasadena Playhouse," Loewenberg points out. Her own producing 
career until the radio drama series was spent largely in rented Equity-waiver 
theaters with 99 or fewer seats. 
</P>
<P>
 She is the first to admit that radio is not her first love: "I'm a theater 
person, not a radio person. Obviously I'd love to be running the major 
performing arts center on the Westside in Los Angeles, with a fabulous building 
whose architecture reflected where we are now. But you know, if it's not there, 
then you must do something else. I love the theater and I love the idea of 
keeping plays alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It never stops being a thrill working with great artists, and I've found a 
way to do it. It makes me happy, it makes my audiences happy, and it makes the 
artists happy. Once it stops being fun, I won't do it anymore. And it 
definitely stopped being fun in the late '80s. We had a dedicated group of 
artists ready to do plays on the stage in Los Angeles, and I could not get the 
funding, could not get anyone interested." 
</P>
<P>
 As she wrote in American Theatre magazine last year, Loewenberg holds a dim 
view of the current theater scene in Los Angeles. In the early '70s, she 
remembers, it was different: "I was doing plays in prisons with inmates; there 
were marvelous ideas floating around, experimentation. It hit its peak in the 
early '80s, and then after the Olympic Arts Festival, it has just gone steadily 
downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day, still, these young, excited people call me. They've just graduated 
from UCLA or come here from Northwestern and they start up these groups and 
they're so smart and there's so much energy and after a year or two -- gone. 
Because they look around and they realize that nothing is going to happen here 
for them. To say nothing of the important playwrights and directors who've 
left. You don't see Jon Robin Baitz hanging out in Los Angeles. You don't see 
David Henry Hwang around here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Loewenberg gave Baitz, the young author of the highly regarded plays "The Film 
Society" and "Substance of Fire," his first production, "Mizlansky/Zilinski," 
at a 99-seat Equity-waiver theater off Melrose in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 In small theaters she also staged the premieres of John Steppling's "The 
Shaper," Milcha Sanchez-Scott's "Latina" and Englishman Steven Berkoff's 
memorably impolite "Greek," which ran for six months at the Matrix in 1983. She 
took "Greek" to New York and, in a notorious incident, closed the play after it 
opened to bad reviews, eliciting cries of betrayal from some of the actors. 
</P>
<P>
 Baitz, meanwhile, remains in her debt and says of Loewenberg: "She's kind and 
brave, which is what producers are supposed to be." 
</P>
<P>
 "She can be tough to deal with," says Michael Peretzian, the William Morris 
agent who represents both Baitz and Steppling. "But she was the first to 
support these guys when the nature of the plays was not runaway-hit material. 
These plays were dangerous . Not designed for a TV pilot." 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought that Susan had an amazing eye for the interesting, offbeat 
play," says Peg Yorkin, the former producer at the Coronet who is now out of 
the theater and says she doesn't listen to radio drama except in the car. "Not 
necessarily my taste, but. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "What does it take to be a producer?" says Ed Asner, who has appeared in at 
least half a dozen of the L.A. Theatre Works plays for radio. "Being able to 
out-smile everybody that you know, being able to talk real good, getting people 
to do favors for you -- Susan is quite bright, very charming. She knows how to 
stroke people. She has stroked me pretty good. And I would say that she's done 
very good work." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone she has worked with is quite so enamored -- in particular Judith 
Auberjonois, the former critic and actress who worked alongside Loewenberg for 
five years in the attempt to launch L.A. Classic Theatre Works before quitting 
unhappily in 1989. Auberjonois maintains that the repertory company was her 
idea and that she raised the initial capital by soliciting the actors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I brought them in," Auberjonois says, meaning Asner; Richard Dreyfuss; her 
husband, Rene Auberjonois; Ted Danson; Julie Harris; Amy Irving; John Lithgow; 
and about 30 more who paid dues of $3,000 a year to be in the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started partnering with her in the belief that she could deliver the 
underpinnings that were necessary for the development of a company, and that 
did not prove to be the case. She was really unable to deliver that, has never 
been able to deliver that, which is why I think she does what she does now." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Loewenberg: "She didn't bring in all the actors. She brought in some of 
the actors, and I brought in some. Judith was great, but she was inexperienced. 
She didn't understand the realities of what it takes. When you're a person who 
works in the theater, when one idea doesn't work, you change gears. You have to 
evolve. You can't have a vision that's stuck. I think I'm good at seizing 
opportunities, and if something doesn't work, I do something else, and I find a 
way to make it happen. Judith didn't have that kind of flexibility." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Loewenberg grew up in New Jersey, daughter of a department store owner, and 
began working as an actress from the age of 14 on live television shows in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 She declines to reveal her age but says she graduated from Sarah Lawrence "in 
the '60s." She came to California soon after college with her then-boyfriend, 
actor Charles Grodin. The two were employed for a year in a soap opera called 
"The Young Marrieds." 
</P>
<P>
 She acted in an episode of "Marcus Welby, M.D." directed by the young Steven 
Spielberg and appeared in commercials. But she gave up acting in 1974. 
"Ultimately it wasn't for me. I had some good times, but producing is more 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Loewenberg married, had two children, divorced and remarried. Her second 
husband, Ezra Suleiman, teaches political science at Princeton University. 
</P>
<P>
 On her current schedule, Loewenberg regularly works her way across the 
country, stopping in Chicago to plan and oversee her productions there, then 
spends four or five days with her husband in New Jersey before returning, 
possibly stopping in Chicago again on the way back. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a new-plays person, a cutting-edge person only," Loewenberg says of her 
days of producing for the stage, which began with her grant-funded Artists in 
Prison program at Terminal Island in the mid-'70s. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to figuring in the careers of Baitz, Steppling, Sanchez-Scott and 
Berkoff, she also gave Timberlake Wertenbaker her first L.A. production, later 
dropping what she says was $100,000 on a staging of Wertenbaker's "The Love of 
the Nightingale" in Santa Monica in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Doing plays for radio has forced Loewenberg to step back from the cutting 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was producing for the stage I was only interested in highly theatrical 
work," she says. "But on radio, there are many other considerations. In the 
theater I never had any interest whatsoever in doing a play like "Fallen 
Angels" -- just wasn't my mission." 
</P>
<P>
 But when Judith Ivey and Annette Bening suggested the 1925 Noel Coward comedy, 
Loewenberg reconsidered. And the performance was a "Fallen Angels" that would 
probably have impressed Coward, were he still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 There are new (or recent) plays scattered in the mix as well. Baitz's "Three 
Hotels" is scheduled to be heard later in the season, along with A. R. Gurney's 
"The Cocktail Hour" and Ariel Dorfman's "Death and the Maiden," with a 
different cast than is now onstage at the Taper. 
</P>
<P>
 As to whether people are listening on Saturdays at 6:30 p.m., it's hard to 
say. Public radio is not about ratings, to begin with. KCRW General Manager 
Ruth Seymour, one of Loewenberg's close friends, does say about the series, 
"Susan has generated a lot of churn. There's good word of mouth, interest, 
excitement." 
</P>
<P>
 "The days when people would sit around the radio on Sunday night are probably 
gone," Loewenberg says. "But I think people listen while they're getting ready 
to go out on Saturday night. It's a good way to absorb material while you're 
doing something else." 
</P>
<P>
 Cassette tapes of the plays are available for sale, and she believes that a 
lot of people prefer to get the tapes and listen in the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles playwright Doris Baizley, author of "Mrs. California" and a 
longtime associate of Loewenberg, acknowledges that she was initially against 
Theatre Works migrating to the radio. 
</P>
<P>
 When her play "Tears of Rage" was first broadcast, Baizley remembers, "I was 
sitting at home and it was hard to listen to my own play. I wanted to get in my 
car and drive around for two hours. Because theater happens in the dark. And 
we're not used to radio as entertainment. But I've warmed to it, because it 
does another good thing: It makes you listen to the words." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Stern, the producer who put the Matrix Theatre on the map and has also 
worked successfully in television, finds it hard to work up much enthusiasm for 
radio drama. "If it can bring more audiences in, great, but if it's just 
another reading . . . it's pressed turkey instead of real turkey." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "KCRW Playhouse" is not the only radio drama on the dial. California Artists 
Radio Theatre, headed by former Orson Welles associate Peggy Webber, produces 
radio plays from time to time for FM stations KPCC (89.3) and KUSC (91.5). KNX 
(1070 AM) offers a regular menu of canned drama from radio's Golden Age. 
</P>
<P>
 "Radio drama is not a high priority around here," says Andy Trudeau, NPR's 
director of cultural programming. "As far as I know, no one else (besides 
Loewenberg) has made a go of it full time. They probably are the closest thing 
in America to the BBC." 
</P>
<P>
 Loewenberg hasn't ruled out the possibility of producing for the stage again, 
but she's far from despair in her current situation. Hollywood, so often the 
target of complaint from local theater people, is her greatest asset, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think something is wrong when you are constantly blaming another art 
form for your failure to flourish. We have the accessibility of the top acting 
talent in the world -- I know because they work for me. There's a roster of 
about 200 people I can call on now. There is almost nobody who won't come and 
do one of my shows. People respond to good ideas; they respond to ingenuity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a whole group of artists and technicians has learned about a new art 
form -- radio drama -- that was pretty dead. We've all just had a great time 
creating some terrific little mini-moments in the theater that are preserved 
because we're recording them for radio." 
</P>
<P>
 But let her finish. "The question now is what is the next step? There always 
has to be a next step. We must take it to another level."

COVER STORY; DANCE TO THE EDGE; A CONTROVERSIAL L.A. MODERN DANCE TREND THAT 
SOME ARE CALLING HYPERDANCE EMPHASIZES ATHLETICISM, ENDURANCE AND RISK, SERVING 
AS A TIMELY METAPHOR FOR SURVIVAL IN AN AGE OF DISASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an era of fires, floods, earthquakes, riots, recession and AIDS, L.A.-area 
modern dance suddenly teems with metaphors for survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the Southland, a major trend in local work is defined by 
hyper-athletic, risk-oriented dancing in which contending with physical objects 
and with changing architectural conditions reflects feelings about trying to 
exist in a confined, threatening or out-of-control environment. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't protest art; it's movement for movement's sake. But the physical 
conditions and structure of the work undeniably address how human beings cope 
with overwhelming events. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests of gravity, stamina and spatial ingenuity are central to this kind of 
dancing: How many times can you roll steeply uphill in military formation? How 
many different ways can you move a pile of 50-pound wooden blocks? How much 
dance can you cram on a tabletop? Inside a plexiglass cube? Onto a single 
concrete block? 
</P>
<P>
 Jacques Heim, Stephanie Gilliland, Joel Christensen, Frank Guevara, Mehmet 
Sander and Lori DuPeron come from different dance backgrounds, but all have 
worked locally in this controversial new style or school or offshoot of 
postmodernism. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people are calling their work Hyperdance, partly because its advocates 
inevitably praise its hyper-physical, hyper-kinetic intensity, while its 
detractors say it's mostly hype. Either way, it's different from the 
hyper-physical work coming out of other U.S. cities or touring here from 
Europe, Canada and Japan. Rather than portray social themes or dramatize human 
relationships, the trend in L.A. emphasizes objects, architecture and extending 
the physical limits of dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, all dance involves a quest for personal bests, with such idioms as 
ballet, modern and jazz dance particularly intent on technical expansion: 
faster footwork, more turns, higher jumps, longer stretches. But those forms -- 
and even the postmodernism that made task- oriented motion commonplace on our 
stages -- typically denied effort. Dancers tried to make it look easy, to 
always seem in control. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer. Watching people swallowed up by strenuous, uncontrollable processes 
has become increasingly familiar on L.A. stages. And showing effort has become 
a sign of honesty, if not a badge of honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Work like this isn't appearing in other U.S. communities in any concentrated 
fashion, says Sali Ann Kriegsman, director of the dance program at the National 
Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say I'm seeing more of it (on a national level)," she comments, 
explaining that narrative and autobiography still dominate contemporary dance 
elsewhere, and what's happening in Southern California could well be a 
rejection of the emphasis on expressive content. 
</P>
<P>
 Kriegsman considers Hyperdance to be "part of dancers' normal appetite for new 
challenges, new horizons" and finds it a melding of techniques from the martial 
arts, the sports world and the physical fitness craze, along with a deep 
creative response to "the explorations of the moon and space: overcoming the 
terror of loss of gravity, the potential for movement that isn't grounded in 
the usual way." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 At Highways Performance Space in Santa Monica, seven members of Jacques Heim's 
Diavolo Dance Theatre swarm up a ramp to the top of a seven-foot-high metal 
jungle gym and then dive off -- some landing on a platform halfway down, others 
on the floor below. Three take the plunge face down. Then they do it again. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Heim's "Tete au Carre," the 10-by-10-by-7-foot jungle gym functions 
as a city infrastructure, confining the dancers, conditioning their movement 
options and continually changing around them with the addition of the ramps and 
platforms, as well as curtains and projection screens. Heim says the theme is 
"the relationship between people and architecture, specific environments. And 
it was very hard to deal with this kind of (dance) space. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got that (idea) by living in L.A.," he says. "I feel really trapped here, 
going from point to point in my car, so I wanted to do a piece that is 
confined, and in the last section I have eight people -- some of them are 
6-foot-4 -- inside the jungle gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "How will all of them move in this environment?" Heim asks. "How will they 
relate to one another? I know the way I relate to people here is very different 
than the way I related to people in Paris or New York. It's affecting us and 
affected most of the movement (in this piece)." 
</P>
<P>
 The 29-year-old Heim, solidly built with deep-set eyes and a nervous, watchful 
manner, comes to Hyperdance from a background in European dance theater. He 
created and performed street theater in his native Paris, then studied dance 
both in England and at CalArts. He currently teaches contact improvisation at 
UCLA and the Orange County School of the Arts and says that, as a 
choreographer, he goes back and forth between theater and experimenting with 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to mix those," he says. "What I try to do is based on 
relationships -- how we relate to another man, how we relate to a woman, how 
two women would relate. But when I talk to the dancers, I say I'm not 
interested in doing a piece particularly about something, but more to see how 
far we can go physically with a theme. Especially how far we can go into 
stamina. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very interested in working with non-dancers, people with sports 
backgrounds, people who are interested in moving, who are quite physical, who 
are not afraid of risk, who are not afraid of people jumping into them or of 
falling." 
</P>
<P>
 Heim is one of the choreographers set to appear in a sampler program of 
Hyperdance at Cal State L.A. on March 26 and 27 -- the first event of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If such films as "The Red Shoes," "The Turning Point" and "Flashdance" defined 
the dancing image and aspirations of previous generations, Hyperdancers seem to 
emulate a strikingly different movie role model: the infinitely malleable, 
well-nigh indestructible quicksilver ninja of "Terminator 2." 
</P>
<P>
 The high-velocity women's attack squadron in Stephanie Gilliland's 
"Coriolanus" certainly comes close, fusing a gritty, streetwise attitude with 
intimidating physical force. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're literally inventing a new body in dance," Gilliland, 41, exclaims. "You 
can't do the work we're doing without having a different body. And it might 
mean bigger thighs or more developed arm muscles, whatever's needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "My aesthetic happens to be people flinging their bodies in space with 
abandon," she says. "I love strength and power -- I find it incredibly 
beautiful. But I also do very quiet solo work." 
</P>
<P>
 Her suite of "Furniture Pieces" has a little of both: high-flying tabletop 
gymnastics for three women and a solo full of intricate, improvised gymnastic 
balances located on a carpet-covered cat-scratcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Why dance on furniture if you're not Fred Astaire? Because working with 
objects and unlikely spatial formats generates new movement possibilities, 
Gilliland says. Instead of accepting the stage floor as the dancer's God-given 
habitat, "you alter the place where activity occurs," she says, "and make it 
higher or smaller -- like a table -- or even use a cat-scratcher where it's 
abnormally low but not quite on the ground. You can't do on a stage what you 
can do with these different surfaces and levels." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilliland started studying modern dance in college. At UC Riverside, where she 
now teaches, she received support as a young choreography student and began 
making dances in 1977. "My first work had a comical leaning and I worked much 
more in conventional movement language," she recalls, "but I always felt a kind 
of interest too in rock 'n' roll energies in my work." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point in the '80s, Gilliland explored what she calls "crash-and-burn 
physicality," then gave it up for "a more fluid, gentle, sensual kind of 
movement. That's when I first appeared in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Simultaneously tomboyish and feline as a dancer, she explains her conversion 
to Hyperdance as partly a matter of "inventing myself as an artist and a woman 
. . . (and) confronting the notion of what a woman is capable of at a certain 
age." But some of the lure is what she calls "responding to the environment we 
live in": 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people who are doing this kind of work are somehow predisposed to it 
and are reacting to the place and the time. Even when I had concerns that maybe 
I was doing something potentially dangerous to my body or to the other dancers. 
I wasn't able to not do it. I would go into the studio and try to make more 
gentle work, and it just wouldn't come out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Christensen, 24, a blond, wiry dancer who puts a surprisingly whimsical 
spin on task-based work, says Hyperdance takes the performer into "a different 
state of being: I see things very differently when my heart is going at a 
certain pace and my blood is surging and my muscles are getting tired and I 
have to keep talking to my body and reminding myself of what's ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 "One major thing that I'm interested in," he says, "is demonstrating labor and 
the human need to work. I think that's where I find a large part of the common 
denominator with my audience. Because I think we all understand its importance 
and satisfaction as well as how it provides a structure to our day." 
</P>
<P>
 An emerging artist, Christensen is one of two Hyperdance choreographers who 
have made solos using auto tires as both dancing partners and trampolines. His 
"Tired" involves stacking 20 tires in various formations and then destroying 
each arrangement -- but not before throwing them, jumping into piles of them 
and bouncing off them in many different ways. 
</P>
<P>
 He trained in karate as a child and then Golden Gloves boxing in his early 
teens before coming to Los Angeles and signing up for football and ballet at 
Beverly Hills High. "But (visual) art was really my main focus ever since I was 
little," he says. "So physicality and art combined for me in dance. It was the 
perfect answer." 
</P>
<P>
 He went to New York University but cut classes to spend more time 
choreographing and so never graduated. When he came back to L.A., he joined the 
Mehmet Sander company for eight months, then left to perform his own program of 
what he called "industrial dance." 
</P>
<P>
 Ambitious and resourceful, he runs a choreography workshop and is producing 
the Cal State L.A. Hyperdance showcase at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 He finds a number of connections between Hyperdance and the L.A. environment: 
"We keep hearing about how violent it is here and how hard you have to work. 
Also L.A. is a city about the hard body, being strong and beautiful, and this 
work brings that to the front. But it's also a reaction against Hollywood: no 
acting, no stories, no glamour." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To meet extreme and sometimes unprecedented demands for speed, stamina and 
sheer brute force, many of these dancers are now working out and bulking up as 
never before, challenging the standard image of a slender or sinewy "dancer's 
body." Four years ago, Frank Guevara weighed 145 pounds. Now he's a hunky 175. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulking up has been a conscious program on his part to, in his words, "get a 
more physical, more masculine look as a dancer. And more strength. For the 
physical pieces you need to work out with weights because you need to be 
stronger. My characters are very macho , so that (bigger) body does help a lot. 
If I was still thin in the upper body, I think it would look funny." 
</P>
<P>
 Guevara, 28, has made just two Hyperdance pieces to date -- one of them not 
yet seen publicly. He says he was "inspired by Mehmet Sander to test my body, 
to find out how much it can take, but obviously in a different way than he 
does." 
</P>
<P>
 He uses Hyperdance techniques to depict character, he says, and especially to 
address Latino community issues. In "Cursum Perficio," for instance, he 
interacts with an auto tire, portraying a street guy he describes as "very 
stubborn, challenge-oriented. Maybe not much education but intelligent." 
</P>
<P>
 And the tire? "I think it symbolizes the cycle of life," Guevara says, "but 
it's basically an object he's familiar with. He finds different ways to connect 
with the tire: He holds it, brings it through his body, jumps from it, rolls 
it, dives into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Guevara began dancing at 5, doing folklorico for about six or seven years, and 
then began training locally at Plaza de la Raza and high school in modern and 
jazz dance, along with ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 He did his first TV show at 17 and worked as a commercial dancer -- movies, 
music videos, commercials, industrial shows, exercise videos -- while studying 
at Cal State L.A. In 1989, he formed the East L.A. Choreographers' Showcase as 
a venue for local work, and toward the end of 1992 started his own company, 
Dance Theatre of East L.A. He will be appearing at Highways on July 14-17. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In the past, oppressive processes were dramatized -- with some dancers cast as 
oppressors and some as the oppressed. But in Hyperdance, choreographers create 
oppressive structures or physical conditions and then plot strategies for 
survival. The subject of the dance is executing the dance. But meanings do 
arise directly from the motion. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, in Mehmet Sander's "18" (the number of the chapter in Leviticus 
condemning both nudity and homosexuality), he hurled his naked body over and 
over against a huge cross marked with tape on the stage floor. Resistance to an 
oppressive religious tradition became symbolized by the act of Sander trying 
every possible way to accommodate his body to that shape on the floor. Geometry 
became protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Sander, 27, has been working in hyper-physical expression for more than a 
decade and now aims for a stark, content-free, futuristic form of movement art 
that pushes against human limits. His pieces about homosexuality have been 
replaced in his repertory by these works and severe spatial experiments. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, performance is a sacrifice," he declares. "When I go onstage, there is 
the expectation that it shouldn't be a comfortable experience. If you don't 
occupy the most dangerous and unusual spaces, then it's not an interesting 
dance to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not really happy with what the body can do," he says. "I want it to be 
manipulated by outside forces and try to compete with them. So I really need 
the help of objects that move faster than human movement. Cars and bullets, for 
example." 
</P>
<P>
 Sander's "Ricochet" involves shooting rubber bullets through a hole in the 
transparent wall of an empty bulletproof room and tracing the exact rebound 
pattern. Next, dancers go into the space and "try to move as fast as the 
bullets and hit exactly the same spots," he says. Another piece requires the 
dancers to try to outrun their own reflections. 
</P>
<P>
 Impossible, of course. "But even if it seems that way," he argues, "by proving 
ourselves wrong, it's going to bring a new (movement) vocabulary or system into 
being." 
</P>
<P>
 An outdoor piece scheduled for next year will consist of what Sander calls 
"duets for four dancers and four cars. It was originally four duets for eight 
dancers, and I changed four of the dancers with the cars so that the integrity 
of the duet is the same but the dancers are challenged more. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cars are going 30 to 35 miles per hour, moving back and forward in laps, 
so you're occupying pretty much the same space as they do. When they come 
toward you, you have to jump high enough so that, by the time the car comes, 
you land on the hood and don't roll off. It's just like having your body thrown 
to another dancer: You jump from one car moving 30 miles to another moving 30 
miles. So the space changes more drastically and faster." The Salzburg Festival 
is negotiating for the premiere, Sander says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some members of his company declined to become cast in the car piece and 
Sander says he respects their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe they're not ready mentally," he says. "It's definitely a mind-over-body 
piece. Some of my dancers need a warm-up class. I never do a warm-up. I can 
march to the stage right now and do any of my works. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I threw you in the middle of a freeway, would you say, 'Well, I'm not 
warmed up to run?' he asks with a sneer. "If you have the idea in your head 24 
hours a day that you can do whatever you want at any moment, you can . I want 
the car piece to take that (idea) as a core, for the dancers to have great 
urgency to execute the piece and survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Sander was born in Istanbul, Turkey, and studied dance in London, at Harvard, 
at the American Dance Festival and at Cal State Long Beach. His work has been 
seen at nearly all of the local modern-dance venues, and he appeared in seven 
European festivals last year alone. He choreographed Rachel Rosenthal's "Zone" 
earlier this season, and UCLA recently added an additional Sander company 
performance at Schoenberg Hall on May 6 when those on May 7 and 8 nearly sold 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Alone among these choreographers, Sander says that the Los Angeles environment 
has had no direct effect upon his work: "I would be doing the same kind of work 
in Chicago or anywhere else," he says, though he acknowledges that "the 
response and interaction with the city would be different." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiercely protective of his individuality, he objects to being linked in any 
trend with emerging artists who combine his priorities with more traditional 
ways of working. Such conflicts confirm that Hyperdance exists not as a unified 
movement but a constellation of artists with vastly different creative goals 
and levels of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To Lori DuPeron, however, there's a connection, "an underlying purpose. It may 
be just about doing the motions," she says, "and doing them as hard as you can, 
and it's very much about geometry and the laws of gravity and different kinds 
of locomotion. But in the best pieces there's something to be perceived beyond 
that. Memo (Mehmet Sander) says nothing else is going on. But I don't believe 
him. It's about the human condition usually." 
</P>
<P>
 Once a fixture on the local dance-based performance art scene, DuPeron ended 
her stage career by retraining herself for Hyperdance by lifting weights and 
going back to ballet. Then she set the local community on its ear with "ties 
that bind . . . , " a 10-minute solo in which she emerged out of billowing fog 
with 4 1/2-foot ropes attached to the ends of her limbs -- lashing the ropes 
and her body with feral intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 DuPeron, now 31 and bi-coastal, wants to be a dance producer, and she retains 
a special interest in an approach to movement that she calls "one of the most 
shocking and sophisticated tools that we have for communication right now." 
</P>
<P>
 To DuPeron, Hyperdance "walks a fine line between circus, spectacle and art," 
and she worries that its fans will think it is self-generated, invented in 
Southern California out of whole cloth. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, each Hyperdance choreographer can cite a long list of terpsichorean 
ancestors. Nearly a quarter-century ago, for example, Trisha Brown suspended 
dancers from the tops of rooms and even buildings on harnesses and had them 
dance up the walls, claiming a whole new spatial dimension for choreography. 
Her innovations represent one of the starting points for Hyperdance. 
</P>
<P>
 Other creative precedents include Pilobolus' early experiments with bringing 
unorthodox movement vocabularies into the theater, Kei Takei's grueling 
rituals, plus Molissa Fenley's controversial training techniques for achieving 
expanded stamina onstage. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Bebe Miller has manipulated velocity, weight and openly 
acknowledged effort to heroic effect, and Elizabeth Streb has taken dancers far 
from the conventional stage picture frame into dynamic new performing realms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although few Hyperdance choreographers readily acknowledge it, MTV has also 
had its effect -- principally through its illusion (achieved by film editing) 
that dancers can work full-out indefinitely. Living up to this Hollywood 
fantasy can be hell on the body: DuPeron compares the physical demands of 
Hyperdance to "taking a beating or walking on hot coals." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilliland concedes that Hyperdance gets a bad rap for not being body-friendly, 
"the notion that somehow we're compromising our physical well-being for our 
work." In fact, all dancers suffer from injuries and the bulked-up Hyper crowd 
also gets its share. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Guevara, for instance, sprained his ankle jumping off his tire. Mehmet 
Sander recently suspended rehearsals of his car piece when a company member 
dislocated a shoulder. Joel Christensen has had two dance-related knee 
surgeries that definitely make his seven-minute hopping solo "Boing" full of 
personal risk. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most exposed Hyperdance injury to date belongs to Rebecca Butala, a 
member of Jacques Heim's Diavolo Dance Theatre. On the opening night of a 
sold-out engagement at Highways in January, one of the pipes in the company's 
jungle gym came loose when four women jumped on it. A corner of the pipe hit 
Butala's head, knocked her down and cut her. 
</P>
<P>
 "In rehearsals, more drastic things had happened," Heim says, "so she 
continued to dance. But then she saw blood was pouring out of her head, so she 
stopped and crawled out. We ended the performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Butala received six stitches and was back dancing the next night, "still very 
dizzy," Heim recalls, "and we all the time paid attention to her and knew what 
to do if she wanted to stop." He also changed the piece slightly so that male 
members of the company braced the jungle gym while the women performed. 
</P>
<P>
 With contact improvisation, dance is literally a process of touch-and-go -- so 
it's comforting to learn that Heim's company is covered by medical insurance. 
"We try things," he says with a shrug. "Sometimes it doesn't work, sometimes we 
get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 This element of danger makes some Hyperdance audiences behave as if they're at 
the circus. But it isn't present merely for mindless daredevil thrills. It 
exists as part of a commitment to making good on the broken promises of 
postmodernism: stripping away every literary, pictorial and theatrical 
embellishment to discover what dance uniquely is or might be. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Mehmet Sander speaks of using speed and risk to defeat audience analysis 
-- in other words, trying to force viewers to experience a dance as a physical 
act before they can interpret it intellectually -- he's reminding us that dance 
isn't important for what it means but what it does . 
</P>
<P>
 This may sound anti-intellectual, but dance, after all, is not about ideas: 
It's about movement in space. Whatever ideas condition it, emanate from it or 
are imposed on it, it's only the movement you see. And movement can inspire or 
devastate you directly, kinetically, bypassing your centers of understanding 
for a much deeper impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyperdance wants you to perceive the movement first and foremost, before 
laying any trip on it. To that end, it may make connections with familiar work 
activities, everyday objects, fears we all have of falling, of confinement, of 
being overwhelmed by cataclysmic events. Of trying to survive in the City of 
the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, at its purest, it may focus (in Mehmet Sander's phrase) simply on putting 
a human body in a space where it's never been before.

<P>
 Even before people knew there was a Seattle scene, Soundgarden was being 
touted as stars of the future. Well, it took them seven years of recording, but 
they finally get it right with this unruly beast of an album. 
</P>
<P>
 "Superunknown's" effect is diffuse and poetically hazy, as opposed to their 
friendly rivals Pearl Jam's immediate, galvanizing approach. Soundgarden's 
roots remain firmly in the Zeppelin-Sabbath realm, but with its sheer invention 
and willingness to experiment, the band comes on as the Beatles of grunge. Or 
its Pink Floyd. At times even its Residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In this sprawling collection of blues-tinged hard-rock, starburst solos 
explode against black skies, a snarly guitar line corkscrews nastily through 
the length of one song, and there's an actual raga-rock interlude. 
</P>
<P>
 The quartet is too restless to allow a single voicing or sonic configuration 
to remain intact for long. Some weird bass eruption will pop up, or a new 
instrument will suddenly drop into the mix, enhancing a mood of menace and 
disorientation. That apocalyptic tone is carried more eloquently by the music 
and Chris Cornell's typically astounding voice than by the lyrics, which are 
basically enigmatic footnotes to the articulate sound. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent). RICHARD CROMELIN

 FRONT LINE PRAYER: At Grace Church in Cypress today, they'll give thanks not 
just to God, but to those with the sirens. The church has invited hundreds of 
local police officers and firefighters to a special service. "Our firefighters 
and policemen have been through a lot this past year," says Pastor Dave Scott. 
"We're just trying to show our appreciation." . . . Speakers include Cypress 
Police Chief Daryl Wicker; he'll talk about how his faith and his job are 
integrated. 
</P>
<P>
 BIRD WATCH: The Headlands above Dana Point Harbor is home to several 
threatened species -- including the Pacific pocket mouse. But it was the 
California gnatcatcher that brought National Geographic magazine to the 
bluff-top for a recent photo shoot. . . . Unaware of the raging battle over a 
proposed luxury resort for the property, the magazine's reporter asked Joanie 
Lahage of the Endangered Habitat League if south Orange County was interested 
in environmental issues. Says Lahage: "I let him know that the fight at our 
local level gets pretty hot." 
</P>
<P>
 STARRY NIGHT: Comedian Red Skelton, 80, does a running gag: "I'm sticking 
around until I find out who gets Brooke Shields." It's Orange County that has 
her, at least this week. . . . The former child star, who now lives on the East 
Coast, will be special guest at the $200-per-person Black & White Ball on 
Friday night at Le Meridien Hotel in Newport Beach. It's to benefit the Olive 
Crest, which operates group homes for abused children. Other stars scheduled: 
actors Perry King and Cindy Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 ADDING PRESSURE: When Gov. Pete Wilson said last week the state would add 
$50,000 to the reward for information in the killing of Garden Grove Police 
Officer Howard Dallies Jr., that put the reward total at $75,000. Now the 
Garden Grove City Council has boosted its original offer enough to put the 
total at an even $100,000. . . . "We hope it will jar memories and jar loose 
information," says Police Chief Stanley L. Knee. "We want to catch the public 
eye."

 RIDING THE RAILS: Many commuters from the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys 
appear to have abandoned their cars for a Metrolink train. Before the Jan. 17 
earthquake, daily ridership on the Santa Clarita line was less than 1,000. When 
Metrolink extended service to the Antelope Valley after the quake, ridership 
shot up to a peak of almost 22,000 on Jan. 25. Train ridership has leveled off 
to about 7,000 daily (above), but still, the increase over pre-quake days is 
dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 THE LONE DEPUTY: For five winters, Bennie Garnes has been Los Angeles County's 
most isolated deputy sheriff. From Thanksgiving to Easter, he becomes a 
mountain man, patrolling by himself 300 square miles of high country in and 
around Wrightwood.(B1) . . . Garnes has played a key role in rescuing numerous 
hikers and skiers lost in the frozen wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 QUAKE SURVIVOR: Salvador Pena, the janitor who was trapped under two floors of 
a shopping mall garage after the Northridge earthquake, doesn't speak must 
English. . . . But what he does know was enough for the firefighters, who 
labored for seven hours to free him. "Thank you very much, my friend," he told 
each of them Saturday. (B1)  
</P>
<P>
 EDWARDS' PAST: It's about seven years late and a tiny fraction of its original 
design. But, finally, in late April, Edwards Air Force Base will have a museum. 
(B20) . . . You'll be able to check out the history of the base, watch videos 
and gaze at models of the 100 or so airplanes that made their maiden flight 
there, including the first American jet in 1942.

 BUBBLE BURSTS: Crescenta Valley High's unlikely run through the Southern

HARVEST TIME: TOSSING WORK, LUCK INTO SALAD; AGRICULTURE: GOURMET GREENS ARE 
SENT ACROSS COUNTRY AS A FIELD NEAR CAMARILLO PRODUCES ITS FIRST PROFITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the freeway, the field now looks like a vast, just-vacuumed carpet, a 
uniform stretch of bright, bright green. 
</P>
<P>
 Up close, however, the beds more resemble a scruffy patchwork quilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Nurturing three types of lettuce plus radishes and turnips, the field bristles 
with contrasting shapes, sizes and colors. A broad oval here, a spiky nub 
there. A deep green, a silver sheen. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been nearly a year since three ranchers bought the 60-acre patch just 
outside Camarillo for $420,000, taking out hefty bank loans and risking their 
other landholdings as collateral. They spent countless hours -- and hundreds of 
thousands more dollars -- preparing the long-abandoned acreage for planting. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it's payoff time. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of spending, the farmers are ready to earn. But first, they must 
harvest the blooming field and find markets for the gourmet greens. 
</P>
<P>
 Because rancher Jim Roberts planted the field in eight-acre strips, his 
workers have been picking the crop steadily throughout the winter. So far, 
they've harvested about half of the 60 acres dubbed Conejo Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 As always, the laborers have encountered a few weeds and a few bugs as they 
trudge through the endless bend-and-pick rhythm of the harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 But overall, "the field's done all right," Roberts said. "We've sold most of 
the crop," he added. "That's what counts." 
</P>
<P>
 Abandoned for more than a decade before Roberts and his partners reclaimed the 
swampy land for agriculture, Conejo Ranch has survived its first big test. But 
while the field has produced well, the partners at Underwood Ranches remain 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 The culprit: this winter's confoundedly perfect weather. 
</P>
<P>
 To Craig Underwood's dismay, farmers across Southern and Central California 
have been enjoying remarkably mild temperatures this year. Unscathed by 
October's wildfires, January's earthquake and February's mudslides, many 
ranches have produced bumper crops. 
</P>
<P>
 The crackling freezes that usually grip the Imperial Valley have skipped 
eastward. The cold, wet weather that usually dampens the Salinas harvest has 
given way to mild, spring-like temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 And extended growing seasons in both regions have yielded more competition for 
Underwood Ranches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to anticipate Mother Nature. We plant in anticipation of other guys 
being out," said sales director Minos Athanassiadis, a partner in the Conejo 
Ranch venture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, winter means bad weather. Winter means frost. Winter means rain, 
disrupted planting seasons, lettuce crops freezing on the stalks," 
Athanassiadis said. "Usually, winter tightens up the supply and lets us bring 
our prices above break-even." 
</P>
<P>
 Usually. But not this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The average price farmers receive for their gourmet salad -- a tumble of baby 
lettuce and exotic greens -- has dropped to less than $9 for a three-pound box 
this year. Normally, that box would sell for about $12. Four years ago, when 
horrendous weather devastated the competition, even salad of mediocre quality 
fetched $14 a box. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the farmers at Underwood Ranches wouldn't mind a freak freeze in 
Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
 Or some ravenous, lettuce-loving locusts in the Imperial Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds mean-spirited, but the partners don't really wish their competition 
evil. A little run-of-the-mill bad luck would do just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need something to happen somewhere, whether it be weather-related or a 
catastrophe," said Alan Laird, deputy agricultural commissioner for Ventura 
County. "If everything goes along normally, and production is on schedule 
(everywhere), sometimes you have too much supply." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the bad weather elsewhere in the country is causing as much 
consternation as the unyielding warmth in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Slick roads and sinking temperatures back East have nibbled steadily away at 
the demand for fresh produce. Bundled in front of toasty fireplaces, even the 
hardiest consumers have cut back on trips to restaurants and supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the bulging supply and constricted demand, Underwood Ranches' partners 
still earn 15% on their salad some months, when the capricious market breaks 
their way. But mostly, they've been watching glumly as net revenues dip further 
and further. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, harvest at Conejo Ranch continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Field hands, mostly Mexican immigrants, pack red crates with the gourmet 
greens each morning, picking just enough between 6 a.m. and noon to fill that 
day's orders. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, they ignore the most recently planted rows, which nourish the 
smallest shoots. The baby plants, stripped across the eastern end of the field, 
remain smaller than clover, leaves no bigger than fingernails. 
</P>
<P>
 Marching in order of size like Russian nesting dolls, the greens gradually 
grow larger, peaking mid-field amid bushy heads of tatsoi and arugula. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the mature plants, in the westernmost block, lie the beds that have 
already been harvested. Churned-up dirt, sprinkled with a few stray leaves, 
creates a rough-textured contrast with the gleaming rows of green. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On days following a storm, new colors and textures join the montage of dirt 
and plants on Conejo Ranch. Shiny rivulets of water snake up the furrows and 
shimmering puddles pool in a trough toward the field's southern edge. 
</P>
<P>
 On one such sodden morning in mid-February, Agustin Garcia drove a tractor 
through the muck to collect lettuce-laden crates and place empties in position 
for the next day's harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 The tractor's massive wheels wobbled drunkenly in the thick, grasping mud. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard, huh?" Garcia said, grinning. "But I have to work. You get to be a 
big mess, but you don't have a choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Picking the baby greens is considered skilled work among field hands, who earn 
$6.92 an hour plus benefits. Each day they must assess the quality of the 
mature plants, and decide which leaves to cut with their stainless-steel 
knives. Because the lettuce bruises easily, they must handle the plants 
tenderly. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrots, in contrast, require only entry-level skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvesters simply pluck the baby carrots from the ground, check that the 
shoots are finger-sized and the tops a healthy shade of green, and chuck the 
vegetables into a crate. After seven years as Underwood Ranches' harvest 
supervisor, Jesus Valladolid -- known as Diablo -- can estimate fairly well how 
many boxes of greens his crews will need to fill each morning. If the company 
gets a surprise order, he receives the news through his ever-crackling 
walkie-talkie and passes it on to his field foremen. 
</P>
<P>
 The walkie-talkie system makes communication easy -- Jim Roberts carries his 
in a back pocket and flips it out like Clint Eastwood drawing a gun. Just a few 
years ago, however, Roberts and Diablo had no walkie-talkies. 
</P>
<P>
 Their salad crops, still experimental, were spread out among dozens of fields, 
squeezed between cauliflower and broccoli. To coordinate the harvest, they 
first had to find each other. And often, Roberts said, they would end up 
circling endlessly between Camarillo and Oxnard, driving 150 miles each in a 
single day. 
</P>
<P>
 As Underwood Ranches lurched toward large-scale production of baby lettuce and 
gourmet greens in the late 1980s, the partners lacked critical technology, from 
walkie-talkies on up. 
</P>
<P>
 And they came up with some pretty wacky substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 An old Speed Queen laundry machine hooked up to a lawn-mower engine, for 
instance, served as an industrial-sized salad spinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the farmers got electricity, abandoned the lawn-mower engine, and 
plugged in six new washers. But they never got around to disconnecting the coin 
boxes. So they kept a supply of quarters on hand, plunking them into the 
Laundromat machines each time they had to spin a batch of dripping salad. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their decidedly unconventional techniques, Underwood Ranches began 
getting an increasing number of orders for the salad mix. To fill them, Roberts 
and his employees would often spend all evening packing crates. They would pull 
the refrigerated trucks in a tight circle, turn on the headlights and work in 
the resulting glare. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an amazing period," Roberts said, chuckling at the memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, of course, the salad preparation technology has become more 
sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
 Salad ingredients come straight from the field to the packinghouse in 
Camarillo, the hub of the Underwood Ranches' operation. Because the leaves lose 
a day of shelf life for each hour they sit in the sun, workers must cool the 
harvest immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a race to get it cold as fast as you can," Roberts said. "The worst 
thing you can do to a plant is cut it, because it's dying after you pick it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooling preserves the lettuce for weeks. Some greens get an icy 20-minute 
shower under a waterfall (known officially as a hydrocooler). Others are draped 
with tarps and placed in front of a giant suction machine that whips cold air 
through the leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Once cooled, the greens are dumped into a trough of water set at a specific 
temperature, with exact levels of chlorine and a precise acidity. Workers swirl 
the lettuce in first one basin, then another. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the salad is dried in a high-tech version of the laundry machines and 
packed into plastic-lined boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 A few orders are shipped Federal Express to finicky chefs who demand 
fresh-from-the-field produce daily. Other boxes are loaded onto trucks ferrying 
cargo to local supermarket chains, including Lucky, Ralphs, Hughes and Vons. 
</P>
<P>
 By avoiding both middlemen and shipping costs, area supermarkets can sell 
Underwood salad by the pound for several dollars less than retailers elsewhere 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bulk of the salad is rushed each evening to the Los Angeles Produce 
Market, which shakes awake just after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, the Camarillo-bred greens embark on a convoluted -- yet weirdly 
efficient -- journey to supermarkets, restaurants and specialty groceries 
across the United States and as far away as Canada and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In an East Los Angeles warehouse, Jim Ptaszenski adds the third of six price 
markups to a passel of gourmet greens from Conejo Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 The salad has traveled just 55 miles from the emerald field at the base of the 
Conejo Grade. But already the price has jumped more than 110% above the cost of 
producing the ready-to-eat mix. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the price of a salad may jump nearly 220% above Underwood Ranches' 
production cost by the time it arrives at a far-flung dinner table. To get 
there, it has to go through a bewildering number of middlemen. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry jargon sounds like so much gobbledygook. A box of Conejo Ranch 
greens hits a terminal marketer, a produce consolidator, a regional 
distributor, a wholesale jobber and a local retailer before reaching a 
consumer. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, in plain English: 
</P>
<P>
 To get their salad to a grocery store in Des Moines, Iowa, the Underwood 
partners start by shipping it to the Los Angeles Produce Market, where they 
sell it to a terminal marketer, such as Alan Pollack. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollack's company, Coosemans, specializes in off-beat vegetables. He buys the 
specialty items from local and foreign growers, bundles them together in 
variety packs, and then trucks them down the street to another middleman, known 
as a consolidator. 
</P>
<P>
 The consolidator packs the gourmet items from Coosemans along with produce 
department standards, such as iceberg lettuce and yellow cooking onions. He'll 
then ship the whole carton by air to a regional distributor in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chicago, the distributor will sort and repack the California produce, 
perhaps adding tomatoes from Florida or potatoes from Idaho. Yet another truck 
will take the newly configured load to a "jobber" in Des Moines -- basically, a 
wholesaler with a large warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers will then buy directly from the jobbers, adding the sixth and final 
markup before passing the veggies to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 All that for a bowl of salad. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, cutting middlemen would cripple the distribution system's 
efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 If a consolidator firm in Los Angeles tried to supply the Des Moines store 
directly, it would have to send half-empty trucks -- a waste of time, fuel and 
labor. By shipping to a big-city wholesaler instead, the company ensures full 
cargo loads. 
</P>
<P>
 The round-about system suits grocery managers as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each grocery store carries 350 to 400 items of produce, and each grower will 
traditionally grow no more than 10," Athanassiadis explained. "It's not 
economically feasible for a small Des Moines store to send trucks each week to 
35 different growers in California and Florida." 
</P>
<P>
 Hence the need for Jim Ptaszenski's brick-walled warehouse in East Los 
Angeles. Ptaszenski receives truckloads of fruits and vegetables each morning 
from the L.A. Produce Market and packs them to ship to wholesalers across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent early morning, as smears of pale blue spread across the 
star-flecked sky, Ptaszenski took off his telephone headset and bounded down a 
rickety staircase to his loading room. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxes of Underwood Ranches carrots mingled with other fresh produce on the 
clean-swept floor, the pile dwindling rapidly as a worker packed the vegetables 
into an airplane shipping crate. 
</P>
<P>
 One full crate costs roughly $500 to send across the country -- except during 
the Christmas season, when airlines carry so many cards for the Postal Service 
that they have little room for produce cargo. Squeezing a 3,000-pound crate of 
carrots and salad onto a commercial carrier during the Christmas rush can cost 
up to $1,000, Ptaszenski said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To keep orders flowing and shippers hustling, the partners at Underwood 
Ranches have to keep pushing for new customers. Mainly, that's Athanassiadis' 
job. Once in a while, however, the others have to lend a hand. 
</P>
<P>
 And when he gets the call, Craig Underwood invariably gets grumpy. 
</P>
<P>
 A man who wears suits only to church, and even then reluctantly, Underwood 
must haul out his navy blazer and tie for national produce conventions twice a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even dressed in his Sunday best, Underwood stays out of the spotlight, 
hovering at the fringe of his booth's Burgundy carpet (a color chosen to 
reflect the rich reddish tones of the radicchio captured in a close-up photo of 
the salad mix). 
</P>
<P>
 Uncomfortable with the schmoozing and socializing considered vital in the 
tight-knit produce industry, Underwood keeps a profile so low he seems to 
vanish in the hullabaloo of produce conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the recent hubbub at the San Diego Convention Center, for instance, 
during the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Assn's. 90th annual expo. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry insiders strolled among 600 growers' booths wearing suspenders 
brightened with chili pepper motifs, ties strewn with feathery-topped carrots, 
sweaters decorated with knit eggplants and onions. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Sunkist display, convention-goers putted golf balls through a spinning 
orange-shaped gate, while an electronic clock ticked off how many pieces of 
citrus have been sold this fiscal year (20,300,000 and counting). 
</P>
<P>
 At the Dole counter, people waiting for free salad grinned at a dancing banana 
in red running shoes. Elsewhere, they tapped their feet to live mariachi music, 
grabbed handfuls of free refrigerator magnets, and stormed past the display of 
extra-strong rubber bands. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Underwood stood in the corner and smiled weakly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a terrible salesperson," he said, looking slightly dazed as crowds 
pressed around his booth. "I just hide and let my wife do all the work." 
</P>
<P>
 That's fine with Sara Jane Underwood, a registered nurse who has worked for 
the family business the past 36 years as a bookkeeper, saleswoman, farmer's 
market representative and more. 
</P>
<P>
 Her specialty: lurking in supermarkets back home in Ventura County and 
pouncing on shoppers in the produce sections who load their carts with the 
"wrong" brand of salad or carrots. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego produce expo offered few opportunities for guerrilla tactics. 
But there was plenty of time for what marketing manager Dana Abercrombie called 
"the Sherlock Holmes bit" -- sleuthing out the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 As she strolled through the crowded convention center, Abercrombie scanned 
each booth for new marketing ideas. Usually, she found more to criticize than 
to emulate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their boxes don't match their company colors," she carped. "Their booth 
doesn't look pulled together. They gotta think about the carpet." 
</P>
<P>
 While Abercrombie evaluated the aesthetics, Athanassiadis scrutinized the 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual. "Minos is obsessed with produce," said his wife, Tracey 
Athanassiadis, who works for a Santa Monica advertising agency. "If I send him 
into the supermarket for a carton of milk, he stays for half an hour. He always 
has to check out the competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, ironically, that competition is actually another Underwood Ranches' 
product. 
</P>
<P>
 To satisfy some big-ticket wholesalers, who like to claim exclusive 
distribution rights to select products, the Underwood partners now market their 
carrots under several labels. 
</P>
<P>
 The ready-to-eat baby carrots, for instance, are sold through one wholesaler 
as Sweet Petite and through another as Melissa's. Un-peeled carrots with fluffy 
green tops also come in two varieties identical but for the name: Underwood 
Ranches and Las Posas Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes side-by-side on a single supermarket's shelf, sometimes cross-town 
rivals, the dueling labels compete with each other, and could confuse 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the complications are outweighed, Athanassiadis said, by the benefits: 
Packaging the produce differently satisfies large wholesalers, who account for 
nearly half of Underwood Ranches' sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the San Diego produce convention, the Underwood Ranches' sales pros were 
seeking to boost the retail side of the business, trolling for big-ticket 
customers. They found a potential boon in Lynn Stogsdill, the tall and burly 
chief buyer for Walt Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
 Swinging by the Underwood Ranches' booth, Stogsdill plucked a scrawny Sweet 
Petite carrot from a woven basket of freebies. He nibbled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looks like an interesting product," he said, still chewing as he walked off. 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly a bells-and-whistles endorsement. But a prize nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 Just having Stogsdill's card in hand was enough to encourage Abercrombie. Mind 
racing, she pictured a health-food stand at Walt Disney World. A pushcart 
vendor hawking snack-packs of Sweet Petites. A restaurant salad bar crammed 
with baby carrots. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Stogsdill buys some Underwood Ranches' salad for Walt Disney World in 
Florida, tossing the gourmet mix onto a few restaurant menus. If he could get 
excited about the carrots . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "He (Stogsdill) could really put us on the map," said Steve Schiedermayer, the 
advertising executive in charge of marketing Sweet Petites. 
</P>
<P>
 But sales manager Athanassiadis remains wary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to go crazy, to get drunk with the name of (potential 
customers) or the potential volume," Athanassiadis said. "We don't want to lose 
credibility by not being able to fill an order." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, though, some competitors suspect he'll be unable to resist the 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 And indeed, back home in Ventura County after three days at the produce 
convention, Athanassiadis sounded enthusiastic about his conversations with 
Disney and another potentially big customer, an upscale New Jersey supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a few weeks, he'll design prototype carrot snack packs for the Disney 
buyer and seek new, customer-friendly ways to package beets and turnips for the 
New Jersey grocers. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, Athanassiadis said, he's reasonably satisfied with the produce 
convention. But partner Underwood was less enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably won't do that show next year, because we ended up talking more to 
our competition and our booth neighbors than to potential customers," Underwood 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-day produce convention cost the business roughly $4,000, between 
hotel rooms, meals and other expenses. On top of that, the booth itself -- a 
stand-alone counter and a backdrop plastered with a close-up photo of Underwood 
produce -- cost a hefty $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we just confirm a couple of customers, that'll make up for the price," 
Underwood said. "But it's kind of questionable if it's worth the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Still a small business, with just three full-time sales and marketing staff 
members, Underwood Ranches spends only $40,000 a year on promotion. That tab 
includes two produce conventions, scattered advertising in trade magazines, 
supermarket demonstrations and visits to potential customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Abercrombie, the marketing manager, jumps at any chance to gain additional 
exposure. In San Diego, she happily doled out free carrots and salad to anyone 
who wandered by the booth, from grandmothers to toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to have our products circulating in the industry, with our bag, our 
name, and our address on them," she said. "It shows we're a player." THE FIRST 
HARVEST 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Ranch farmers began harvesting their gourmet greens in January. The 
lettuce is tossed into a gourmet salad mix that is distributed to customers in 
the United States, Canada and Hong Kong. While some salad gets shipped 
overnight express to restaurants, most is sent on a convoluted route that 
begins at the Los Angeles Produce Market. 
</P>
<P>
 Produce Market Route 
</P>
<P>
 Bagged salad stays fresh only 10 days, so quick distribution is essential. 
Still, the produce goes through six middlemen before reaching the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
 1) Lettuce is transported by refrigerated trucks to Los Angeles Produce 
Market, usually arriving by midnight in time for the market's opening at 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Underwood sells box for: $9.35 
</P>
<P>
 2) Lettuce is sold to a warehouse distributor known as the terminal market 
wholesaler. 
</P>
<P>
 Wholesaler sells box for: $11.25 
</P>
<P>
 3) Lettuce is bundled with produce from other growers and trucked to a nearby 
consolidator. 
</P>
<P>
 Consolidator sells box for: $16.00 
</P>
<P>
 4) Consolidator packs gourmet items along with standard produce such as 
iceberg lettuce and ships carton by air to a regional distributor in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Distributor sells box for: $17.00 
</P>
<P>
 5) Distributor in Chicago repacks produce. The new package is trucked to a 
"jobber" -- a warehouse wholesaler. 
</P>
<P>
 Wholesaler sells box for: $18.00 
</P>
<P>
 6) Retailer or restaurant buys produce directly from jobber and sells to 
consumer. 
</P>
<P>
 Market sells 1 pound of greens for: $8.00 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant sells 4-ounce salad for: $5.00 
</P>
<P>
 A Day (and a Half) in the Life of a Salad: How a Box of Greens Gets from Field 
to Table 
</P>
<P>
 By shipping Federal Express, Underwood Ranches can supply fresh greens to 
restaurants across the country in less than 30 hours from picking. This 
timeline and map follow the trail of salad greens from Conejo Ranch, on the 
outskirts of Camarillo, to a restaurant table in Pittsburgh: 
</P>
<P>
 6 a.m. Picking: Crews begin cutting lettuce. They use stainless steel knives, 
assessing quality of plants and carefully handling the easily bruised leaves. 
Lettuce is put into basket after being cut. 
</P>
<P>
 7 a.m. Cooling: The baskets are emptied into large bins and taken to the 
nearby packing facility. To extend the life of the greens, they are showered 
for 20 minutes in 38- to 40-degree water, or moved into a refrigerated building 
where they are placed in front of a machine that sucks cold air from the room 
through the leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 9 a.m. Washing: Greens are dumped into large tanks of chlorinated water where 
they receive two thorough washings. To ensure cleanliness, workers wear long 
sanitary gloves, boots and bonnets. Masks with charcoal filters protect against 
chlorine fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 10 a.m. Drying: The lettuce is dried in an electric machine, similar to a 
kitchen salad spinner, that spins the greens, throwing excess water off the 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 11 a.m. Packing: Lettuce is then dumped into a large plastic crate and packed 
into plastic-lined boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 2 p.m. Shipping: The boxes are loaded into refrigerated Federal Express trucks 
for delivery to LAX, then flown to Pittsburgh via Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 The following day . . . Lettuce arrives at the Pittsburgh restaurant by 10:30 
a.m. and is served that evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The Product 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Ranch grows these three types of gourmet greens, which are mixed with 
nine other ingredients to form Underwood Ranches' Sweet Petite salads. 
</P>
<P>
 Arugula: Its peppery taste gives a salad a kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Mizuna: Its crunchy leaves add texture. 
</P>
<P>
 Tatsol: Its nutty flavor gives a salad body. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 "60 Acres of Hope," a series that began in October, traces the first year of a 
Southern California farm field. The first two articles detailed the field's 
history and first planting, and looked at the ranchers and laborers who spend 
long hours on the land. This story focuses on the first harvest, the packing, 
distribution and marketing strategy. Future articles will explore the economics 
of farming and the ranchers' attempts to find a niche in the crowded produce 
industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven people were killed and at least one was injured in an ambush in southern 
Mexico, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead and injured were among 20 men, women and children traveling by truck 
Friday on a highway near the rural community of San Nicolas Yaxe, the 
government of Oaxaca state said. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck was intercepted by 15 gunmen who forced some occupants to get out 
and then fired on the people still inside with high-powered weapons, the 
state-owned news agency Notimex reported. 
</P>
<P>
 San Nicolas Yaxe and nearby San Baltazar Chichicapam have been involved in a 
longstanding conflict over land. In 1986, the conflict led to several clashes 
between peasants from the two communities.

VENTURA MOTEL AT PRIME SITE HAS BECOME TROUBLE SPOT FOR POLICE; CRIME: JOHNSON 
DRIVE INN HAS SEEN SHOOTINGS, DRUGS AND ROWDY PARTIES. ABOUT 400 CALLS HAVE 
BEEN LOGGED. BUT THINGS ARE IMPROVING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Nearly a decade ago, Ventura's elected leaders turned their attention to a new 
development seen as the future gateway to the city's southern entrance -- a 
polished complex of restaurants, shops and other businesses that would lure 
tourists headed up the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to it all was to be a first-class hotel that would anchor the area and 
funnel weekend spenders to the city's harbor, beaches and downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very adamant about that," said John McWherter, a former city 
councilman. "It was a very good piece of land and we wanted something really 
nice to go in there." 
</P>
<P>
 But things have not quite worked out as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The area along the Ventura Freeway at Johnson Drive boasts an eight-theater 
movie complex, a food court, a Toys-R-Us, a Carl's Jr. and a gas station. But 
the larger, chain restaurants have not been built. And the hotel once seen as 
the anchor to the area has developed a reputation with police as a trouble 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, the 151-room Motel 6 at 3075 Johnson Drive opened in 1988 as a Six 
Pence Inn, owned by the Santa Ana-based chain. But within a year, the Johnson 
Drive property and 45 other Six Pence Inns were sold to the Dallas-based Motel 
6 chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Since July, 1991, Ventura police have logged more than 417 calls to the motel, 
records show. Lt. Pat Miller, a patrol watch commander for three years, said 
that number ranks the motel among the most troublesome addresses in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Police reports show that incidents at Motel 6 have ranged from drug dealing 
and public drunkenness to robberies and assaults. The largest number of calls, 
authorities say, stem from unsupervised parties attended by local teen-agers 
and young adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody rents a room and all of a sudden you have 25 people in there having 
a party, and only one of them has to have a gun," said Ventura County Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Matthew Hardy, who is prosecuting five suspects in the only 
homicide to occur at the motel. 
</P>
<P>
 Motel 6 officials acknowledge the property has had its share of problems. But 
they say the company has done all it can to make the atmosphere safe for 
guests. On the weekend, one or two security guards patrol the well-lit grounds, 
and each room is secured with deadbolts and security latches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we've got the most comprehensive security program of any hotel chain 
in our market," said Gordon Stafford, an attorney for Motel 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, officials say the high number of calls in recent years is a sign 
that managers are trying to curb problems rather than condone them. 
</P>
<P>
 "You rent to somebody and you call the police to make peace. Is that a no-no? 
It seems to me they should encourage that," said Marc Michaelson, a spokesman 
for the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities, however, note that few other sites in Ventura have prompted so 
many police calls. And they say the motel has not done all it could in the past 
to discourage teen-agers from gathering in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like the entire motel is filled with kids running rampant every 
Saturday night. That is not the case," Miller said. "But then you can't hide 
the fact that we've been out there 417 times in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of another place in town that we've been as many times," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most serious incidents listed in police records have been: 
</P>
<P>
 * A shooting May 29, 1992, in which an Oxnard man walked out of his 
second-floor room and fired several shots at two groups of teen-agers in the 
parking lot. One of them grabbed a semiautomatic handgun and fired back, while 
another launched a bottle rocket at the hotel, police reports say. 
</P>
<P>
 * The abduction of an 18-year-old woman from her room on Sept. 5, 1992, by a 
Los Angeles man who knew her. When another female guest heard the commotion and 
peeked out her door, police reports say, the man threatened to shoot the second 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 * And the Dec. 18 fatal shooting of a 21-year-old shoe salesman from Whittier 
who was gunned down as he stood on a second-floor walkway. Authorities have 
charged several suspected gang members from Oxnard and Port Hueneme with the 
slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 The Johnson Drive motel was also the scene of a five-kilo drug bust in July, 
1990, when federal agents arrested two Oxnard men and their alleged supplier 
from Los Angeles, records show. And it was at Motel 6 that Gaston Ortiz, 27, of 
Long Beach was arrested in April, 1991, on suspicion of kidnaping a 14-year-old 
Cabrillo Village girl for 24 hours, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated by the recurrence of teen-age parties at the motel nearly every 
weekend, Ventura Police Officer Jon Castellanos wrote a memo to his supervisor 
in February, 1992. He described the problems and said motel managers had been 
unresponsive when he tried to discuss possible solutions with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is just a matter of time before two of these gangs rent a room on the same 
night, have an altercation, and (we) have a major incident on our hands," 
Castellanos wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that month, Miller met with local Motel 6 officials and discussed 
Castellanos' concerns. He said he asked the manager to take steps to prevent 
the weekend problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to say they ignored it. Maybe they just didn't communicate it to 
everybody," Miller said. "But they continued to rent to local teen-agers and 
that was one of the major issues. They continued to do that and that draws the 
kids there." 
</P>
<P>
 Motel 6 officials deny the criticism, saying they have always tried to work 
with Ventura police. They cite a companywide policy of not renting to anyone 
under 18, and a new policy at the Johnson Drive motel of not renting to any 
local residents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of the total 417 calls to police, records show that 144 were "disturbances," a 
generic term for offenses ranging from loud music to a fistfight to gang 
members brawling with knives and guns. 
</P>
<P>
 When violence at the motel has occurred, it has almost always been on the rear 
side facing Johnson Drive, out of sight of front desk clerks, police reports 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the case Sept. 10, 1993, when an argument between several Oxnard 
youths led to half a dozen shots being fired at 21-year-old Eddie Rojo and his 
girlfriend. The couple scrambled for cover beneath a car, then Rojo ran away, 
saying he feared for his life, according to police reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was afraid if I stayed there, they would have killed me," he said. Rojo and 
his girlfriend said they went to the motel to hang out with some of her 
friends, despite its reputation as a "party place that gets busted all the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 On the night that 21-year-old Paul Martinez was fatally shot, investigators 
say, dozens of youths from Oxnard and Port Hueneme were drinking and mingling 
at the motel. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the victim and the suspects were attending parties on different 
floors on the rear side of the motel. A close friend, Gerald Razo, said 
Martinez had arrived about 10:30 p.m. with Razo and Razo's former Army buddies 
from Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects -- Shaun Bolo, 20, his brother, Willard, 23, and Stephen Hidalgo, 
20 -- were part of a large group spilling out of Room 222, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief confrontation between Martinez and the suspects, the local 
youths apparently left, firing six to 15 shots from the parking lot as they 
wheeled out, according to prosecutor Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the shots ripped through Martinez's arm and pierced his heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy would not say what prompted the shooting. But given the volatile mixture 
of guns, gangs and alcohol, police say violence was almost inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a caldron waiting to brew over," said Sgt. Carl Handy, one of the 
first officers on the scene. "And it did." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the three suspects charged with murder, two others -- Naomi 
Honohan, 19, and Alfonso Serrato Cortez, 21 -- have been charged with being 
accessory to murder. All five are believed to have gang connections, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Motel 6 officials say there was little they could have done to anticipate or 
prevent the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if you had people in the parking lot that were spillover from the 
parties, you wouldn't assume that violence was going to occur," Stafford said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two months since the killing, police say the 151-room motel has quieted 
down considerably. Motel employees are now quick to toss out juveniles 
loitering in rooms or parking lots. To prevent cruising, temporary barriers 
have been erected in the rear parking lot. IDs are required to rent a room. A 
sign above the front desk announces a policy of not renting to local residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't heard of a call out there since the shooting," said Handy, who 
leads the department's gang unit. "I think they've solved it for the time 
being." 
</P>
<P>
 As evidence of the motel's commitment to keeping the peace, a dozen or so 
Ventura teen-agers found themselves promptly booted from Room 206 a few weeks 
ago when they arrived for a party. 
</P>
<P>
 They had filed into the room noisily, letting out whoops that echoed down an 
open-air corridor. Within 15 minutes, the manager was on the phone and a 
security guard stood outside the door. 
</P>
<P>
 After being asked to leave because there were too many people in the room, the 
teen-agers filed out of the room littered with beer cans and out to the parking 
lot, where they made plans to go elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "This used to be a spot," complained Jeni, a 17-year-old who declined to give 
her last name. "I figure it's better to have people here in a motel room than 
at a house." 
</P>
<P>
 Motel 6 officials say their attentiveness is part of an effort to improve 
security throughout the chain of 700 motels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company just bends over backwards to work with local police departments 
everywhere, and we take very seriously what the local police departments 
suggest to us," Michaelson said. "If they are that concerned, we respond. 
That's company policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials say some of the motel's problems are inevitable 
given the transient nature of its patrons. But they also say its location along 
the Ventura Freeway could play a part in attracting crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer incidents are reported at a second Motel 6 in Ventura on Harbor 
Boulevard. And police in Simi Valley say they have only occasional, minor 
problems at a Motel 6 there. 
</P>
<P>
 Police speculate that the Motel 6 on Johnson Drive might be seen as a neutral 
location for rival gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Keith Lazz said juveniles gathering at 
low-budget motels is a common occurrence throughout the county. In Camarillo, a 
Motel 6 and a Good Nite Inn are the most popular party spots, although neither 
location has been the scene of serious problems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just a thing that gangs do, it's just kids in general," Lazz said. 
"It's kind of hard to fault the motels unless it happens every night and 
they're not keeping a lid on it." 
</P>
<P>
 A manager with the security company that guarded the Johnson Drive motel for 
four years acknowledged that the location had a high number of teen-age 
parties. But he said serious crimes were no more frequent there than at other 
motels. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was rather hectic," said Larry Cane of All Valley Security. "A lot of 
people went through at a lot of parties." 
</P>
<P>
 All Valley no longer provides security there because of the long commute from 
Lancaster, where the company's employees live, he said. A different company is 
now providing security.

 Cane said Motel 6 officials were responsive to security concerns. When a guard 
spotted a party with teen-agers, motel clerks would tell the people to leave, 
then call police if the party-goers refused. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very good system they had," Cane said. 
</P>
<P>
 Motel 6 officials say crime at the Johnson Drive property merely reflects the 
level of crime throughout the area. And while the chain says it will keep 
trying to improve safety, officials say there is only so much they can do to 
screen out troublemakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in a free society," said Michaelson, the company spokesman. "And if 
someone wants to come and rent a motel room, and he's got money and and ID, I 
guess you rent it to them."

WEAPONS CAUSE BIG JUMP IN EXPULSIONS AT COUNTY SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Twenty years ago, schools typically expelled only the very worst students, the 
incorrigible few who committed some unpardonable violation of the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Expulsion is still the punishment of last resort. But school districts in 
Ventura County are resorting to it much more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1992-93 school year, Ventura County school districts kicked out 169 
students, more than in the previous two years combined. And this school year, 
the number of expulsions is approaching last year's high: 104 students have 
been expelled since fall and at least 32 other cases are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, school districts can expel students for a variety of misdeeds 
that range from selling drugs to punching a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dramatic increase in the number of expulsions in the county is due 
mainly to a single offense: weapons possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Driven both by public concern over school safety and by new state laws, many 
districts have begun to automatically expel students caught with any type of 
weapon -- from guns to bats to penknives. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-line policy works, school officials say, to protect students from 
classmates who might be prone to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets a message out loud and clear that we have a zero tolerance for 
weapons," Supt. Joseph Spirito of the Ventura Unified School District said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has a downside, some officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 By expelling students for up to one school year, they say, schools could be 
failing in their primary responsibility to educate all children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have the responsibility of not only having safe campuses but also of 
ensuring a good education for kids," said Mary Samples, director of pupil 
support services for the Hueneme Elementary School District. "In the long run, 
if you look at it, if we expel a kid, maybe we tend to make them more at risk 
than if they were in the system." 
</P>
<P>
 While expelling problem students might help schools, it could create bigger 
troubles for society. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to be very careful we're not just throwing kids out of the district 
with no place for them to go," said Howard Hamilton, assistant superintendent 
with the Pleasant Valley Elementary School District. "You don't want a lot of 
angry kids roaming the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Under a new state law that took effect Jan. 1, students expelled from any 
California school district for certain offenses, including selling drugs on 
campus or possessing weapons, are forbidden from enrolling in any other 
district in the state during the period of the expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County students who are expelled are eligible to attend Gateway 
Community School in Camarillo, a continuation school run by the county 
superintendent of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Gateway offers classes for seventh- through 12th-grade students only, 
which leaves younger expelled students without a public school to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough call for us," said Spirito of Ventura. "We're not sure we want 
to put a sixth-grader on the street for a year with no education." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura school officials deal with this problem by sending teaching assistants 
to the homes of younger students who are expelled. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the possible pitfalls of expelling students, many county educators say 
it's the best method they have for ensuring that their schools meet one of the 
most fundamental requirements of parents, teachers and students: campus safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wants to work on a campus that isn't safe and nobody wants to go to 
school where it's not safe," said Samples, who is also a parent. "The bottom 
line with parents is that none of us want to think that we're sending our 
children to school every day and they're in danger." 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to October, 1993, California law entitled but did not require school 
principals to recommend that their school boards expel students caught with 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 But a law that took effect last fall made it mandatory for districts to hold 
formal expulsion hearings for all students found carrying firearms, knives or 
other dangerous objects. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that law was superseded in January by a more lenient version that 
requires expulsion hearings only for students caught with a gun, many local 
school districts have nevertheless continued to expel students found with any 
type of weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference is that in the past the principal may have said, 'Well, this 
kid's got a Swiss army knife at school, let me take it away from him. Let's 
look at his record and decide what punishment to mete out,' " Ojai Unified 
School District Supt. Andrew Smidt said. Now, he said, principals don't have 
that discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Ojai set it's zero-tolerance policy on weapons last year, the number of 
expulsions in the district has gone from zero to seven -- all for weapons 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the weapons were guns, Smidt said. Most were pocket knives with blades 
no longer than two or three inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ojai school officials stuck to their strict policy of expulsion for 
weapons possession, they also took into account their belief that most of the 
children had brought the weapons to school without any intention of using them 
against any other person. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, district officials considered that the only public school available for 
expelled students is Gateway, which is about a 45-minute drive from Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gateway is a tougher option for us," Smidt said. And, he said, "we don't want 
to take educational opportunities away from kids." 
</P>
<P>
 So the Ojai school board decided to suspend six of the seven expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
 Under suspended expulsions -- a punishment that some county school districts 
use with children who are too young to attend Gateway -- students are able to 
continue their education in their home districts either through independent 
study or by even attending regular classes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But they are on a strict probation: If they are caught breaking any school 
rules, they can be kicked out of their districts without any hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 In some county school districts, officials began taking a harder line with 
students caught with weapons even before the new state laws took effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Valley and Oxnard Union High School districts have for at least the 
past few years followed strict policies of expelling students caught with any 
type of weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Some districts decided to crack down on students caught carrying any type of 
guns and knives following incidents of school violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura school district set it's zero-tolerance policy on weapons last 
spring after a Ventura High School student was killed near campus. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, last month's stabbing death of a 14-year-old student by a 
classmate at Valley View Junior High School spread alarm not only among parents 
and school officials, but also among students. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Feb. 1 killing of Chad Hubbard, more Simi Valley students are 
reporting on classmates carrying knives, bricks and other potential weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids are giving up a whole lot more information," said Leslie Crunelle, 
director of secondary education. "We're finding out about a lot more stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 The district has expelled three students since the Valley View incident and 
has 12 other cases pending. Before the incident, the district had 18 expulsions 
for the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of the expelled students had assaulted a classmate or were 
caught with drugs, most were found carrying knives or dangerous objects such as 
stink bombs or bricks, Crunelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the students caught with weapons since the Valley View slaying was 
threatening other people, she said. In one case, a boy was punished simply for 
pulling out a Swiss army knife to trim strings off his backpack. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the violence at Valley View, that boy probably would not have been 
considered for expulsion, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of the heightened concern, the school board expelled the student, 
then immediately suspended the expulsion and transferred him to another school 
in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to send a very strong message to kids and to parents that we do 
not want any object on our campus that has no value instructionally and that 
can be conceived of as a weapon," Crunelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 And most students will probably get the message, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some educators said they expect the number of expulsions for weapons in the 
county to level off or decline in a year or two, as students realize the harsh 
consequences of carrying weapons to school and leave their knives or guns at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who are expelled may appeal to the Ventura County Board of Education, 
which can rule whether a school district board followed the state education 
code in ordering an expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 11 expulsion appeals that the county board has considered in the past 
two years, it has sided with the school district about two-thirds of the time, 
county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 State law allows school districts to expel students for a maximum of two 
semesters. At the end of the expulsion periods, students may petition to return 
to their districts. 
</P>
<P>
 But school districts are not required to accept them. In the tiny Briggs 
Elementary School District near Santa Paula, officials two years ago expelled a 
seventh-grader who was caught with a knife on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 When the student asked to return, the school board turned him down because 
during the expulsion period he had gotten into trouble with the law, Supt. 
Carol L. Vines said, declining to give more details on the case. "It wasn't 
safe to have him here." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all students want to return. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Quintero was expelled from the Oxnard Union High School District three 
years ago after he was caught wielding a lead pipe in a riot between groups of 
black and Latino teen-agers at Oxnard High School. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first few months after he was kicked out of the district, Quintero 
did not attend school at all. "I was just kicking with my homeys," the 
18-year-old said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Quintero enrolled at Gateway where, officials said, he has thrived in the 
family like atmosphere, which offers its 450 students small classes and more 
individual attention than is typically available at public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Quintero, who is president of his welding class and who plans to attend 
Ventura College next year, said he has had no desire to return to Oxnard High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like coming here," he said. Students Expelled From School 05,28,08,08,08,11

PLAN FOR NEW WING HEIGHTENS QUARREL BETWEEN 2 HOSPITALS; PROJECT: BACKERS SAY 
IT'S NEEDED TO REPLACE DILAPIDATED STRUCTURES. BUT CHIEF OPPONENT CALLS IT PART 
OF A COUNTY SCHEME TO VIE FOR PRIVATE PATIENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A $30-million new wing for Ventura County's public hospital has become the 
lightning rod in a heated quarrel between that hospital and nearby Community 
Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials argue that most of the 105,000-square-foot addition at the 
Ventura County Medical Center will replace a hodgepodge of aging, dilapidated, 
asbestos-ridden structures that leak in the rain and are an embarrassment to 
the public health system. 
</P>
<P>
 But Community Memorial officials oppose construction of the new wing and an 
$8-million parking garage, insisting that the project is not needed, is too 
costly and is part of an aggressive county plan to compete for private patients 
and not just treat the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors approved the project in concept last year. But a 
final vote is not expected until 1995. And Community Memorial is building its 
case against the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, a chief attraction of the project has been the promise of a 
70% state reimbursement for construction and borrowing costs initially 
estimated at $50 million. County health officials acknowledge that the project 
could die politically without the state funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "An opportunity exists for the county to save $35 million" by submitting 
project plans to the state Department of Health Services during a window of 
opportunity that will close in June, 1994, wrote county Health Care Agency 
Director Phillipp K. Wessels. His assertion was the first sentence of a project 
description to the supervisors last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, as engineers complete their plans for the new wing, administrators at 
Community Memorial have counterattacked. 
</P>
<P>
 They say state reimbursement, which must be appropriated in the budget each 
year, could vanish as a stubborn recession continues to force billions of 
dollars in state cuts each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You simply can't count on those funds," said Los Angeles accountant Virginia 
McClain Rusk, a consultant to Community Memorial. "The issue is that there is a 
substantial risk, and an informed decision needs to weigh that risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Aunt Martha says she's going to help you meet the mortgage and Aunt Martha 
goes bankrupt, the mortgage is still yours," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusk said some counties have held up their applications for similar funds in 
part because of nervousness about reliability. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura County health officials -- buttressed by the opinions of several 
state officials -- insist that they can count on state reimbursement. They cite 
new hospital projects under way in Riverside and San Bernardino counties that 
rely on the same 1988 state law -- Senate Bill 1732 -- for reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's less than 100% certain, because it depends each year on the legislative 
process that generates the appropriation to support it," Wessels said. "But the 
track record is that they have approved it." 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the state money, the county could make its annual bond payments, 
county hospital Administrator Pierre Durand said. But it would have to borrow 
part of the money from the county general fund for 10 of the project's first 12 
years. And part of the borrowed money would not be repaid to the general fund 
-- which supports basic services such as police protection -- for 24 years, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such borrowing -- beginning at $288,025 a year and escalating to $1.5 million 
in the sixth year -- would be a "cash-flow strain for the general fund," Durand 
said. And it could jeopardize the project when it goes before the Board of 
Supervisors for final approval, he acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without 1732 (reimbursement) we need to probably come up with different 
options," he said. "There's no decision I know of that's supporting the project 
without 1732." 
</P>
<P>
 How strong is the Legislature's financial commitment to rebuild the state's 
safety-net hospitals for the poor? 
</P>
<P>
 Opinions vary among state and hospital industry officials who know the 
program. But most said in interviews that if Ventura County qualifies for the 
program, the state is legally obligated to make its annual reimbursements and 
can be counted on to make them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify, the county must submit engineering plans by June 30 and VCMC must 
have a patient load that is at least 50% indigent or Medi-Cal insured. The 
county hospital's percentage of such patients is about 70%, thus its 70% rate 
of reimbursement, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a legal commitment to honor those projects that have made it through 
the window by June 30," said Kirk Stewart, senior state Department of Finance 
analyst for Medi-Cal appropriations. "Essentially if they're in for a 20-year 
commitment, we're obligated for 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 William Wehrle, who analyzes the Medi-Cal budget for the legislative analyst's 
office, said the state apparently has no legal way out of its commitment. "It's 
a pretty clear-cut obligation. . . . It sounds about as ironclad as legislation 
could be." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Klusman, a state Medi-Cal supervisor, said the Legislature could, in 
desperation, withhold construction funding to county hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can decide not to fund something. It depends on how big the budget 
deficit is," he said. "But I think they would be hard-pressed not to fund a 
program they set up in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, said the state's budget crisis could affect new spending 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the state in a fifth year of budget deficit, it doesn't look good," said 
Michael Dimmitt, lobbyist for the California Assn. of Hospitals and Health Care 
Systems. "They're going to have to look pretty hard to find these additional 
funds." 
</P>
<P>
 In a public statement last month, a spokesman for Community Memorial said lack 
of state support for the 1732 program is evident because the Legislature 
approved no money for it this fiscal year, and Gov. Pete Wilson has recommended 
none for next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Community Memorial was wrong. State officials said Wilson's budget 
recommends $59.3 million to cover obligations under the law and that an 
original $13.85-million appropriation this fiscal year has now reached $31.3 
million because more counties have signed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Klusman said about 15 counties, including nearly all the large ones, have 
expressed interest in the funds and that the costs of probable projects could 
reach $2 billion. Half of the money comes from the federal Medicaid funds, with 
a 50% match from the state, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only $2 million has been paid out so far, he said, because state reimbursement 
is not triggered until the new buildings can be occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the reimbursement issue, Community Memorial has argued that the 
county's new wing is too costly and that VCMC officials should have considered 
cheaper alternatives in tight budget times -- such as leasing space from 
Community Memorial and other nearby facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The $38-million cost of the new wing and parking garage is far higher per 
square foot than the $16.5 million Community recently spent on a similar 
structure three-fourths as large, said Michael D. Bakst, Community Memorial's 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakst also maintains that it is unwise to build a new hospital wing when 
existing hospitals are only half-full and the universal health-care program 
proposed by President Clinton could make the current public system obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Memorial officials also maintain that the county's estimate for 
construction and financing of the new wing and garage, now revised to $57 
million, is perhaps $20 million too low. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think those costs are understated, and that is a disservice to the 
supervisors, who are not being told the entire story," Bakst said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wessels said Bakst is just wrong about county cost estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Clinton package, even if approved, would have almost no effect on the 
Medi-Cal system, because the President's reforms focus on providing health care 
to the working poor, not those already covered by Medi-Cal, Wessels said. 
</P>
<P>
 County Hospital Administrator Durand said putting county clinics at a variety 
of locations -- instead of in the new outpatient wing -- would create hardship 
for patients and costly inefficiency for the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 He also argued that long-term leases are foolish, because the new wing would 
pay for itself in 24 years and create savings of $19 million after 40 years -- 
even if the county gets no reimbursement from the state.

<P>
 Ventura County residents can expect cloudy skies again today and a chance of 
light showers, the National Weather Service said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a possibility of thunderstorms as warm air from the eastern 
Pacific mixes with a cold front from the Gulf of Alaska, said Stuart Seto of 
the National Weather Service in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm system probably will pass through the area by this afternoon, and 
clear skies will return to the county on Monday, with highs reaching the 70s, 
Seto said. SCOTT HADLY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OXNARD/PIRU; OIL CLEANUPS FINISHED BUT CHARGES POSSIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The cleanup of two major oil spills in Ventura County is completed, but the 
Ventura and Los Angeles county district attorney's offices still are 
considering filing criminal or civil charges against the oil companies 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The state attorney general's office may seek civil penalties as well if the 
oil companies fail to restore the ecologically sensitive areas affected by the 
spills, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County district attorney's office will determine whether it will 
bring charges against Bush Oil Co. after the state Department of Fish and Game 
completes its investigation of a spill, which resulted from a broken pipeline 
and leaked more than 84,000 gallons of crude oil into the McGrath Lake wetlands 
in December, Deputy Dist. Atty. Doug Whaley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report should be completed by April, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office is considering filing 
charges against Atlantic Richfield Co. for an oil spill that fouled more than 
12 miles of the Santa Clara River east of Piru after a pipeline ruptured during 
the Northridge earthquake, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are several possibilities, code sections (the company) may have 
violated, but we are purely in the investigative stages," L.A. County Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Erica Martin said. "It spilled into a waterway, so that brings up a 
whole spectrum of water pollution charges." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County district attorney's office is investigating the spill 
because it originated near Valencia in Los Angeles County, Martin said. The 
D.A.'s office hopes to have the investigation wrapped up in the next few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general's office is waiting for the Department of Fish and Game 
to complete natural resources damage assessments on the spills before 
determining what action it might take, officials said. The department hopes to 
have those studies completed before the end of the year. TRACY WILSON

 Growing up on a cattle ranch in eastern Simi Valley, Kathleen Flanagan 
remembers hunting for arrowheads in old Chumash Indian caves as her father rode 
horseback through the sage-covered hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Today a gnarly oak tree and a curving road called Flanagan Drive are all that 
remain of the old family ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 In its place sits a development of wood, stucco and tile houses called Indian 
Hills. Where cattle once roamed, modern, two-story houses dot treelined streets 
with names like Geronimo Avenue, Sitting Bull Place and Crazy Horse Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't look anything like it did when I lived there, but I think they've 
done a good job," said Flanagan, whose family sold its ranch and moved to 
central Simi Valley after her father died in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20 years later, the 617-acre Indian Hills neighborhood was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucked in the northeast corner of the city, Indian Hills is bordered on the 
south by the Simi Valley Freeway, and on the west by Stearns Street and the 
Simi Hills Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
 The upscale neighborhood of 574 houses caters to white-collar commuters 
seeking refuge from the crime and crowds of Los Angeles and the San Fernando 
Valley. Nearly half of Indian Hills' working residents drive more than 30 
minutes each way to get to their jobs, according to the 1990 U.S. census. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's worth the drive," said Tom McCarthy, who commutes to Beverly Hills, 
where he works as a vice president of a property management company. "The air 
is cleaner and the kids have plenty of open space to roam around." 
</P>
<P>
 The planned addition of 235 houses along Yosemite Avenue in the next decade 
may increase traffic and block some homeowners' views, but residents said they 
are confident that the area's tranquil atmosphere will remain intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Although bounded by the 18-hole golf course and a bustling fast-food 
restaurant, residents say the neighborhood has retained the qualities that 
first drew the Flanagans to the site: stunning views and peace and quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Troop, a realtor who lives with her husband in a four-bedroom, 
three-bath house at the east end of the development, said Indian Hills is the 
kind of place where residents keep tabs on anniversaries, promotions and 
graduations through a neighborhood newsletter. They block off streets for 
neighborhood barbecues and plan outdoor dinners to enjoy spectacular sunsets. 
</P>
<P>
 Views throughout the development are unmarred by power and telephone lines, 
which are underground. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue herons, snowy egrets and red-toed hawks soar over the neighborhood, while 
chirping frogs fill a creek near the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When an old windmill perched above the neighborhood was destroyed during a 
storm, neighbors pitched in and bought another one to replace it. 
</P>
<P>
 Troop said she and her neighbors have fought to preserve the natural state of 
Chumash Park, an undeveloped 52-acre stretch of hilly land at the 
neighborhood's eastern end. Residents from throughout Simi Valley frequent the 
park's Chumash Indian caves and its hiking trails leading into the Santa Susana 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who live here place a high value on the peace and beauty of the area," 
Troop said. "We are all devoted to keeping it that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents have gone even further to preserve the rural character of 
Indian Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighborhood group called Citizens for a Safe and Scenic Simi Valley has, at 
various times, fought against development of a shooting range, Shell gas 
station and McDonald's restaurant in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing noise and safety concerns, the group, led by then-President Eileen 
Gordon, was able to defeat plans for a city-run outdoor shooting range nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 They were unsuccessful in halting construction of the McDonald's, which was 
built at the east entrance to the neighborhood at Yosemite Avenue. They also 
failed to stop development of the Shell gas station, carwash and mini-mart 
planned for construction later this year next to the McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 However, by attending every Planning Commission meeting and every public 
hearing on the matter, the group was able to force many changes in the gas 
station project, including installation of a stop light at the corner of 
Yosemite Avenue and the Simi Valley Freeway and construction of a sound wall 
between the development and the neighboring homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were really satisfied with how things turned out," Gordon said. The group 
has now expanded and is tackling citywide safety and development issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the commercial development, a sense of separation from the rest of the 
city pervades the entire Indian Hills neighborhood, with each tract offering 
large, single-family houses with spacious yards on quiet cul-de-sacs. 
</P>
<P>
 At the neighborhood's eastern edge lies Indian Hills Ridge, its four-bedroom 
houses built with vaulted ceilings, sky lights and swimming pools. Houses 
lining Flanagan Drive take in sweeping views of the hills, the city and the old 
Chumash trails. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To the west of the ridge, Indian Hills Ranch, home to Simi Councilman Bill 
Davis and Ventura County Supervisor Vicky Howard, curls around the Simi Hills 
Golf Course. Perched above the course are the exclusive, widely spaced houses 
of Indian Hills Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 B. Michael Smith said he often comes home from his job as an insurance agent 
in downtown Los Angeles to find golf balls in his back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I feel like I should wear a helmet, just in case," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Below it all, in the shadow of four million-gallon water tanks, Indian Hills 
Meadows stretches from Alamo Street to the Simi Valley Freeway and from Stearns 
Street to Yosemite Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Pipelines to three of the tanks burst during the earthquake, crushing a ridge 
and sending a mud slick oozing down the hillside into several houses. 
</P>
<P>
 No houses in Indian Hills were destroyed in the quake, but eight received 
yellow tags from city inspectors, meaning extensive repairs are required. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Hamilton, the volunteer program coordinator for the Rancho Simi 
Recreation and Park District, lost three chimneys in her house in the Meadows. 
"We have quite a bit of damage, but it's repairable," Hamilton said. "I'm just 
grateful that it wasn't worse and for all the support we got from our 
neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents throughout Indian Hills pride themselves on their sense of 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like growing up in the '50s," said Eileen Vrbanac who lives in 
Indian Hills Meadows with her husband and their two sons. "People know each 
other and look out for each other." 
</P>
<P>
 The predominantly white community of about 2,400 mirrors the city in its 
ethnic uniformity, with minorities accounting for less than 25% of the 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40% of adult Indian Hills residents have graduated from college, 
compared to 28% of Simi Valley's total adult population. 
</P>
<P>
 The median family income stands at $59,123, about 4% higher than the citywide 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Vrbanac, a 12-year Simi Valley resident, said she and her husband consider 
their move to Indian Hills eight months ago a step up from their former central 
Simi Valley neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, it was a move up," said Vrbanac, who works as a nurse in the San 
Fernando Valley. "It feels safer and friendlier." 
</P>
<P>
 Vrbanac said she and her husband considered other neighborhoods, but decided 
on Indian Hills because of its location and the price they were able to get for 
their 2,500-square-foot house. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought about Wood Ranch, but it's clear on the other end of town," 
Vrbanac said. "I didn't want to add that much time to my commute. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple were also able to buy their house for $294,000, down from a 1991 
asking price of $360,000 for a similar house on the same street. 
</P>
<P>
 Realtors said the vacancy rate in Indian Hills is extremely low. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the earthquake, a lot of people took their homes off the market to make 
repairs," realtor Karen Lindeen said. "There was very little available before 
and now there's even less." 
</P>
<P>
 Houses in the hillier parts of the neighborhood are more expensive. Troop, who 
has sold 20 houses in the Indian Hills Ridge tract, said she just closed escrow 
on a house with a swimming pool, spa and view for $335,000. A 3,100-square-foot 
house in the Indian Hills Estates tract runs as high as $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are special homes," Troop said. "For what you get, it's a very good 
value." Indian Hills at a Glance

TEEN-AGERS GATHER TO LEARN ABOUT AIDS; HEALTH: MORE THAN 200 TAKE PART IN 
CONFERENCE AT MOORPARK COLLEGE. THEY CITE NEED FOR MORE EDUCATION. 
</P>

<P>
 During the two weeks she was waiting for the results of her HIV test, 
17-year-old Sarah Dixon thought about the AIDS virus and the destruction it can 
cause -- something many of her peers seem reluctant to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I wasn't at high risk, I was still anxious to go back and be 
sure," the Westlake High School junior said. Thankfully, her results were 
negative. But hundreds of teen-agers across the nation haven't been as 
fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 With the number of human immunodeficiency virus cases rising among youth 
nationwide, Sarah and other Ventura County teen-agers have committed themselves 
to educating young people about the risks of unprotected sex in the hopes that 
it might prevent some from contracting the deadly disease. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, more than 200 Ventura County teen-agers, from one end of the 
county to the other, gathered at Moorpark College for a daylong conference 
aimed at educating youth about issues relating to acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome and HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole conference was put together by kids for kids, it's real unique in 
that respect," said Dale Hoffman, county coordinator of Friday Night Live, an 
alcohol and drug prevention program that co-sponsored the conference. "We're 
really trying to break down some barriers in a safe and comfortable 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman said the idea for the conference, which featured a series of 
provocative and humor-filled workshops, was sparked by an AIDS awareness 
seminar directed at youth in Los Angeles. Ventura County health educators and 
students were so impressed with the program that they organized a conference 
here. The first was held last year in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers who participated in the day said they aren't given enough AIDS 
education in their schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just this overwhelming need for AIDS education," said Shannon Gulden, 
youth coordinator of the conference and a senior at Nordhoff High School in 
Ojai. "All we get at Nordhoff is what we're taught in our GSR (general state 
requirement) class." 
</P>
<P>
 Lauren Scotto, a sophomore at Thousand Oaks High School, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I learned in health about AIDS was what it stood for," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trevor Althof, a senior at Ventura High School, said AIDS education needs to 
be provided outside school classrooms.  
</P>
<P>
 "People have to know the right ways to prevent it," he said. "Sex is the most 
misunderstood topic. A lot of people are interested, but the education is 
limited to our campuses." 
</P>
<P>
 Trevor, 17, attended last year's conference and said he has become involved in 
teaching his peers about the dangers of unprotected sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a strong commitment," he said. "I not only learn to help others but 
learn how to protect myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Health Services has reported only three AIDS cases among young 
people ages 13 to 19, which represents 1% of all Ventura County AIDS cases, 
said Martina Rippey, county coordinator of AIDS surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
 But national statistics indicate a growing number of teen-age AIDS cases, and 
experts warn that AIDS is spreading rapidly among adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
 As of September, 1991, there were a reported 751 AIDS cases among 13- to 
19-year-olds in the United States, Rippey said. By September, 1993, that number 
had nearly doubled, with a reported 1,412 cases, Rippey said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In its report on AIDS in adolescents last year, the National Commission on 
AIDS warned that the number of cases among 13- to 19-year-olds was deceptive 
because AIDS can take 10 or more years to develop. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS experts maintain that education is the most effective way to prevent the 
spread of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (parents and school officials) are alerted, but they are reluctant to 
talk about it," Rippey said. "Maybe the word is not out strong enough for this 
generation." 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers at Moorpark College on Saturday were willing to face facts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (teen-agers) know about it, but they don't think it will happen to 
them," said Christine Delgado, 16, a junior at Rio Mesa High School in Oxnard. 
"Everybody thinks it will happen to someone else, or they're just misinformed. 
That's why I wanted to come here." 
</P>
<P>
 Veronica Daube, a 14-year-old freshman at Camarillo High School, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to know more about the AIDS virus because I am in a community where 
kids are having sex," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake's Sarah Dixon, who works at AIDS Care in Ventura, said kids educating 
each other is one of the most effective ways to disseminate information about 
the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a closed-mindedness among teen-agers and I think that's holding them 
back from learning about AIDS," she said. "I think it's incredibly beneficial 
when you're involved with other peers, because not everything you learn from 
adults you're going to accept." 
</P>
<P>
 But there were three adults speaking at one of the 10 workshops Saturday who 
captivated the teen-agers with their words. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Halter, Cam Keep and Jim Vellequette all have AIDS. Their message to 
Ventura County's youth was personal and passionate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to save your lives, you guys are our futures," Keep said. "I don't 
want anyone else to wake up with this virus."

DRIVING ENTHUSIAST PUTS CAR DESIGNS IN HIGH GEAR 
</P>

<P>
 Drawing pictures of hot rods and motorcycles used to earn Jim Searcy nothing 
but trouble in his 12th-grade English class 40 years ago. Today, it earns him a 
living. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner of a small glass decoration shop in Redondo Beach, Searcy designs 
trophies for automobile and motorcycle races across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The awards, which sell for as much as $8,000 each, contain intricate, 
three-dimensional images of cars and drivers sandblasted into sheets of glass. 
</P>
<P>
 For Searcy, 57, of Hermosa Beach, pairing his interests in racing and art has 
been profitable. Last year, his one-man workshop, Champ Awards, had sales of 
almost $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Motor racing has always been my love," Searcy said. "So it kind of went 
hand-in-hand with my business." 
</P>
<P>
 Searcy's favorite work revolves around the sport he loves. In 1979, he made 
his first trophy for a sprint car race at the now-closed Ascot Park Raceway in 
Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Searcy has made more than 500 trophies. His latest project is a 
set of awards to be presented to the winners of a competition at this year's 
Long Beach Grand Prix in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a technique that took 10 years to master, Searcy sandblasts detailed 
images into the glass with a compressor that generates 100 pounds of pressure 
per square inch. 
</P>
<P>
 The delicate process involves a good deal of risk -- one mistake can ruin a 
piece, which typically takes 80 to 100 hours to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just don't have any room for error," Searcy said. "In a painting, if you 
make a mistake, you can just paint over it. With glass, if you cut too far, 
you've ruined it."

CONDO OWNERS SEEK $7.7 MILLION; LITIGATION: SUIT ALLEGES THAT BUILDING IS 
POORLY CONSTRUCTED, NOISY AND LEAKS. DEFENSE CONCEDES SOME FLAWS BUT SAYS 
OWNERS EXPECT TOO MUCH.

<P>
 At first, David Shultz was merely annoyed. When his upstairs neighbor walked 
around, the pots in his kitchen rattled and it sounded as though she might drop 
through the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 He could even hear her use the facilities more clearly than he cared to. 
Aggravating, but not alarming. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, about 1 1/2 years ago, water laden with construction chemicals seeped 
through the garage roof onto his wife's car, ruining the paint job. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after, parquet floors in Shultz's ground-level condominium separated 
and swelled up to four inches. One day, he discovered that sections of bathroom 
flooring did not have the materials required to prevent fire from spreading 
between units. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Shultz was unnerved. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shultz, a real estate broker and property manager who moved into the 
Pasadena condominium complex in late 1989, wasn't the only one at 515 S. Orange 
Grove Blvd. with such problems. 
</P>
<P>
 He is one of 16 owners who paid $600,000 to $1 million for their condos and 
who have taken their case to Pasadena Superior Court. They are seeking $7.7 
million in damages from Orange Grove Partners, a corporation established by 
developer Victor Illig and his wife, Evangeline, to build and market the units. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense concedes that the building has needed repeated repairs, but says 
the work sought by homeowners is excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Judson, homeowners association president, testified during the trial that 
he has had to replace his entire living room, dining room and den ceilings 
because of water damage. A section of his dining room is cracking again, and 
Judson believes that it too will cave in. 
</P>
<P>
 Marion Moule, 82, said persistent leaks during rainy seasons have forced her 
to place buckets in strategic locations to catch dripping water and to cover 
her carpet with plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, residents in seven units have reported significant water leaks. Almost 
uniformly, residents complain about excessive noise and faulty air-conditioning 
and heating systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Moule said her daily routine consists of walking in stocking feet, brushing 
her teeth in the guest bedroom, flushing toilets only during the day and using 
her oven to warm the kitchen in the morning -- all so she won't disturb her 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the residents are elderly people who moved into the condos from large 
single-family homes, seeking a simpler life that still afforded a measure of 
luxury. Shultz, 57, is the youngest homeowner. Five widows in their 70s and 80s 
live in the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really thought we were going to get the ultimate," said Ray Judson, 67, a 
civil engineer. Instead, he insisted, they got "nothing but problems. Nothing 
but problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners association filed suit in September, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Judson said he and the other homeowners, who have spent more than $500,000 on 
the suit, originally just hoped to have the nagging problems end. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare the suit, residents hired architectural, structural and mechanical 
engineers to root out evidence that their problems were not being corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the homeowners, the experts found worse -- poor engineering and 
shoddy construction. The result, they say, is an unsafe building. "That's when 
this thing suddenly escalated," Judson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit charges that many of the 150 steel tie-downs, which are supposed to 
help fasten the building from the roof to the foundation, are missing or were 
installed improperly. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners also complain that the complex's walls were not assembled according 
to seismic specifications and could collapse in a large earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Illigs declined to discuss the lawsuit, but their lawyer, Bruce Gridley, 
agreed that the building is not watertight, and that dripping and buckling 
plagued several homeowners. Gridley maintains, however, that leaks were being 
repaired right up until the lawsuit was filed, when they were halted at the 
homeowners' request. 
</P>
<P>
 Gridley denies that the building is unsafe and said homeowners' structural 
complaints, such as missing steel tie-downs, are misleading. He said that as is 
typically the case, the condominium's builders anticipated this type of 
construction problem and compensated by installing more than are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying that the building's structural components meet safety requirements, 
Gridley added: "When a building is not performing structurally, you know it. 
The walls are cracked, the flat surfaces would be sagging, and the walls would 
be leaning. Even after the recent earthquake, that isn't the case." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Gridley, the trial was triggered more out of the homeowners' 
disillusionment with living in the close quarters of a condo complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think these people have been disappointed because I don't think they've 
fully understood what that meant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial has pitted former friends who mingled in the same Pasadena social 
circles, such as the Annandale Golf Club, against one another. "A lot of them 
were very good friends of the Illigs," Judson said of his fellow homeowners, 
"and they really feel like they've been had."

DAY LABORERS FACE OPPOSITION FROM MERCHANTS; LADERA HEIGHTS: OPPONENTS SUPPORT 
A COUNTY ORDINANCE PROHIBITING SOLICITATION OF WORK ON PUBLIC PROPERTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dawn has barely broken, but Pedro Ortiz is already at his regular spot, hoping 
to be among the lucky few picked up for work that day. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a week since his last job, yet the day laborer says he has little 
choice but to keep returning to the Ladera Heights street corner. He has a wife 
and three children to feed, and he has been unable to land a regular job. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvadoran immigrant is one of about 25 to 100 men who gather daily near 
the HomeBase home improvement store at Slauson and Fairfax avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Like fans spotting their favorite star, the men rush each vehicle that pulls 
over, competing for the day's prize -- a chance to earn $20 to $50 for anything 
from cutting grass to busting concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene is repeated every day at street corners and vacant lots across 
Central Los Angeles, where hundreds of predominantly Latino immigrants satisfy 
a steady demand for cheap labor. But their presence has also fueled controversy 
and resentment. 
</P>
<P>
 At sites from Atlantic Boulevard in East Los Angeles to Pico Boulevard in 
Mid-City, residents and business owners complain of what they say are unruly 
laborers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere has the conflict been more intense than in Ladera Heights, where the 
complaints prompted a proposed county ordinance that would prohibit day 
laborers from many sidewalks and streets in unincorporated areas of Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladera Heights residents say the workers litter the area, urinate in public, 
gamble, obstruct traffic and harass women. About 200 residents showed up at a 
community meeting in April, which organizers held to "take back" the 
neighborhood from day laborers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a major, major problem. No question about it," complained Coula 
Fuller of the Ladera Heights Protective League. 
</P>
<P>
 The day laborers and their advocates counter that the workers' behavior has 
been blown out of proportion and that they are being unfairly blamed for the 
actions of a few bad apples. They charge that some of the criticism is 
motivated by racism and intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We come here because we have to," said Ortiz, 26, who added that day laborers 
do the jobs that many others refuse to do. "We have a right to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ordinance was introduced last year by county Supervisor Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke, whose 1st District includes Ladera Heights. Under the 
measure, which the Board of Supervisors is expected to vote on this month, day 
laborers would be prohibited from soliciting work on public rights-of-way 
within 500 feet of churches, schools or residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban would also apply to commercial parking lots, although it could be 
waved if a property owner authorizes day laborers to use the area. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Burke said an enforcement mechanism is needed to prevent 
workers from congregating near homes and apartments. "A residential area cannot 
accommodate that type of activity," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union say the measure would 
violate state and federal constitutional rights to work and solicit employment. 
They vow to challenge the ordinance in court if it is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU, in the 2nd District Court of Appeal, is challenging a similar law in 
the west San Fernando Valley city of Agoura Hills. That law prohibits day 
laborers from soliciting work from public thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that this ordinance is designed and intended to ban the speech of 
those who are most unfortunate in our society," said ACLU attorney Robin Toma. 
"You simply cannot outlaw people from a public sidewalk." 
</P>
<P>
 The day labor phenomenon has its roots in the decades-old California tradition 
of relying on inexpensive Latin American labor, which dates back to the bracero 
program of the 1940s, said David Hayes-Bautista, director of the Alta 
California Research Center, a Los Angeles think tank that studies Latino 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that program, thousands of Mexican citizens were brought to the state to 
work the fields during the growing season. Hayes-Bautista said day laborers 
began appearing in rural areas in the early 1960s and had spread to urban 
communities by the mid-'70s. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years, the Ladera Heights day laborers have gathered at various 
sites in a parking lot of the shopping center that houses the HomeBase store. 
Groups also wait across the street on Slauson and Fairfax avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Located between Baldwin Hills and Inglewood, Ladera Heights is an affluent, 
largely African American community known for its spacious hillside homes and 
sweeping views of the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz and other day laborers gather there because the flow of HomeBase 
customers guarantees prospective patrones -- bosses looking for workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz, who rents a small South-Central home with two other families, said he 
was laid off two years ago from his minimum-wage job making lamps at a Carson 
factory. Since then, he has lived the unstable life of a day laborer, working 
two or three days during good weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not want welfare. I want work," he said as he pulled his jacket collar 
over his neck, guarding against a cold morning wind. Ortiz was the first person 
at the HomeBase site that day, arriving shortly after 6 a.m. Within two hours, 
he was joined by about 30 other men, mostly immigrants from El Salvador and 
Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them was Matias Bonilla, 51, a grandfather and a deacon at the 
evangelical Church of God of Prophecy in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "We come here to earn our daily bread," said Bonilla, who lost his job at a 
South Gate metal shop when it failed several years ago. His wife earns $80 a 
week as a baby-sitter to help care for their four children. "We do not do 
anything illegal -- just look for work." 
</P>
<P>
 Those finding work are often the ones who speak English or who reach a vehicle 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 a.m., a gray BMW pulled into the parking lot. Out stepped a 
mustachioed man who identified himself as Mikio, a Ladera Heights resident, 
offering $5 an hour to scrape and paint his home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six dollars! Seven dollars!" shouted about a half dozen workers, pushing 
against the car as they bargained for more. Mikio remained firm, and only one 
worker jumped into the BMW. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the day laborers be outlawed from the area? 
</P>
<P>
 Mikio shrugged his shoulders. "It's better than having them steal cars and 
batteries," he offered. "At least they're working." 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later, a blue Mercedes-Benz arrived. The driver, who said he was a 
contractor, offered $30 apiece for several workers to operate a rope pulley for 
eight hours, lifting cinder blocks up a two-story building. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a fair wage," the man said to several grumbling workers. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no takers. 
</P>
<P>
 About seven hours after the day began, only five laborers had landed jobs. The 
rest -- including Ortiz -- waited. 
</P>
<P>
 It is that idle time, residents charge, that has led to many of the problems 
in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 They say the day laborers pass the day gambling, drinking, wandering the 
neighborhood and defecating and urinating in the bushes and at a church across 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a problem with them working, but it's the manner that they are 
going about it," said resident Keith Linden, complaining that the workers cause 
traffic jams and aggressively solicit customers at HomeBase. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents allege that some of the workers deal drugs, break into cars 
and homes and make vulgar remarks to women. "The word harassment doesn't even 
describe it," Fuller said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that day laborers have stolen gardening equipment from her home and 
that she has captured drug deals and other illegal activities on videotape. She 
declined a request to view the video because "it's very demeaning to these 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller said she caught the activities by accident as she was videotaping a 
piece on sidewalk improvements, but she added that she was considering sending 
copies of the video to county supervisors before they vote on Burke's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers say the incidents Fuller complains about have been blown out of 
proportion. While they acknowledge that urination and littering did occur, they 
say they now use several trash cans provided by HomeBase and use the restroom 
at a nearby McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a lot better here," said worker Juan Carlos Ruiz. 
</P>
<P>
 HomeBase manager Frank Gomez said he does not have many problems with the 
workers. "They've been pretty well-behaved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Jack Scully, commander of the Lennox sheriff's station that covers the 
area, said residents have reported that day laborers have been involved in 
thefts. But he added that most of the laborers obey the law and are just 
looking for work. 
</P>
<P>
 The day laborers and their supporters charge that racism is behind some of the 
complaints. Many opponents are African Americans, who are showing the same 
intolerance exhibited by white residents when blacks first moved to Ladera 
Heights in the 1970s, said Nancy Cervantes, an attorney with the Coalition for 
Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's an intolerance of poor Latinos," Cervantes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents deny that race is a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "How the hell can you call me a racist?" said Don Lopez, a Mexican American 
who has led the community opposition in Ladera Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes no difference to anybody what ethnicity or gender these people are," 
added Fuller. "It's an issue of conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 Though nearly all the day laborers in Ladera Heights are Latinos, African 
Americans also occasionally seek work there and at other Central City sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Laws, 40, an African American who grew up in South-Central, has been a 
day laborer for the past six years. "If you do a good job, you can sell 
yourself," Laws said as he looked for work at Pico Boulevard and La Brea 
Avenue. "I'm trying to hustle now, get me some money." 
</P>
<P>
 Even in heavily Latino areas such as East Los Angeles, there are complaints 
about day laborers. Rick Esparza, who owns Manny's El Loco Restaurant near 
Pomona and Atlantic boulevards, said the 50 or so workers who congregate near 
his business each day urinate and leave trash in an adjacent lot.  
</P>
<P>
 They have also scared away female customers with sexually harassing comments, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not too discreet," said Esparza, who said he has had several 
fistfights with laborers who attempted to bully him. "They tried to test me. 
But when I started throwing (them) out, they got the message." 
</P>
<P>
 Other businesses in the area have reported similar problems, said Sgt. Glenn 
Peacock, a watch commander at the East Los Angeles sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mid-City, at Pico Boulevard and La Brea Avenue, the manager of Lucy's Drive 
In complains that day laborers loitering in the parking lot frighten customers 
when they rush toward cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all you know, they could be trying to carjack you," said manager Fernando 
Alvarez, who recalled that a customer in a Mercedes Benz recently pulled a 
handgun on several workers as they surrounded his car. No shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez also said the restaurant's insurance carrier is threatening to cancel 
its coverage, saying it could be held liable if a day laborer is injured in the 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Cervantes said such problems can be addressed through communication on both 
sides. "No one denies that there are legitimate concerns," she said. "It's how 
you deal with it that is important." 
</P>
<P>
 In Ladera Heights, she and others maintain, the proposed ordinance is an 
extreme response to a situation that could have been solved without government 
intervention. They say the law will not stop day laborers from congregating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you want to resolve the problem or do you want to pass a law?" asked 
long-time Ladera Heights resident Faz Elahi. He said the day laborers will 
remain so long as there is a need for their services. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said she is attempting to persuade the HomeBase property owner to allow 
a day labor facility in a lower level of the parking lot away from the street, 
which would be permissible under her ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 She said a private company has donated a trailer. And CHIRLA, the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference and several other organizations have offered 
about $1,200 to purchase portable toilets. 
</P>
<P>
 The site would be modeled after two that are operated by the city of Los 
Angeles in Harbor Gateway and North Hollywood. There, coffee is provided to 
laborers who receive work based on a lottery. Rules are posted prohibiting 
drinking, scrawling graffiti and harassing women. 
</P>
<P>
 The facilities were established in 1989 and 1990 after residents and business 
owners complained repeatedly about unruly workers. The City Council considered 
banning day laborers but approved the worker sites as a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon at the Harbor facility, at Harbor Gateway Regional Park, 
26 of the 106 workers who signed in had received work, said manager Richard 
Johnson. Workers who were interviewed said the site was more orderly than 
chaotic street corners where people scramble for work. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the possibility of a similar operation in Ladera Heights is far from 
certain. Resident leaders say their neighborhood is not the proper place for 
day laborers and vow to oppose a hiring site at HomeBase. "I will do anything 
it takes to stop this problem," Lopez said. "I've had it."

UNLIKELY FINALISTS FALL SHORT; BOYS' BASKETBALL: UNDERDOG CRESCENTA VALLEY GOES 
COLD IN 71-60 LOSS TO LONG BEACH POLY FOR DIVISION I-AA TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Basketball tip No. 1: Gotta shoot the ball through that orange round thing 
that protrudes from the backboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Poly High did, and Crescenta Valley didn't in the Southern Section 
Division I-AA final Saturday night before 13,295 at the Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence, Poly 71, Crescenta Valley 60. 
</P>
<P>
 And it wasn't that close. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jackrabbits put the game away by making 12 of 14 shots from the field in 
the third quarter, turning an 18-16 deficit into a 46-31 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took some shots we didn't take in the first half," Poly Coach Ron Palmer 
said. "Fortunately for us, they were going down." 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons' zone defense was allowing open perimeter shots, but when they 
switched to man-to-man, Poly took layups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if any defense would have mattered," Crescenta Valley Coach John 
Goffredo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Damion Dawson was Poly's main weapon. He made nine of 13 shots for 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Poly (25-6), the Moore League champion, shot 56% from the field. Crescenta 
Valley made only 39%, and needed a hot finish to push the percentage that high. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we had a great shooting night," Goffredo said. "We had four 
great ones to get here." 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley, which put up seven air balls, had trouble shooting against 
the background of the Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than seeing a wall behind the backboard, as they do at Crescenta 
Valley, the Falcons shot against a backdrop of spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Richard O'Neill, who has averaged about 24 points this season, made 
only seven of 28 shots. He had 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
 But the background wasn't the only problem. Poly's defense was tough. "After 
watching the film, we totally underestimated their defense," junior Brock 
Jacobsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobsen was the only shooter who played near his potential for Crescenta 
Valley, an at-large entry. He led all scorers in the game with 28 points on 
11-of-17 shooting. The Falcons were also hurt when Blake Jacobson, the team's 
6-foot-9 center, was called for three fouls in the first quarter. He sat out 
the second quarter and was ineffective in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "That hurt about as much as anything could have hurt us," Goffredo said. "He's 
our force in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobson had averaged more than 10 rebounds a game in the playoffs, but he had 
only three against Poly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons were outrebounded, 27-15. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the loss, Crescenta Valley (19-10) has qualified for the first round 
of the Southern California regionals Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons' immediate concern? "We've got to find a gym," Goffredo said, 
referring to the fact that the Falcons' gym was damaged by the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley will be making its first trip to the state tournament. This 
from a team that lost all of its starters from last season and lost its front 
line to injuries early this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we were a year away," Goffredo said. "There was no way we thought 
we'd be here." 
</P>
<P>
 Watching how they played in the first half, one could wonder how the Falcons 
got this far. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley began the game moving as slowly as a glacier, a tempo the 
Falcons desired. They trailed, 6-5, after one quarter. "I was going to sleep," 
Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problem with the strategy was that it still required the Falcons to 
make some shots, and they didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the second quarter, Crescenta Valley had put up five air balls, 
most on three-point attempts, and the Falcons trailed, 16-9. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Falcons scored the last nine points of the half to take an 18-16 lead.

CASTANEDA 4TH, BONEBRIGHT 5TH IN STATE WRESTLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Alemany High's James Castaneda and Thousand Oaks' Tim Bonebright finished 
fourth and fifth in their respective weight class Saturday in the championship 
finals of the State wrestling tournament at the University of Pacific's Spanos 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 At 112 pounds, Castaneda, ranked fourth by California Wrestler magazine, lost 
a 5-2 decision in a third-place match.Bonebright was fifth at 145 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the tournament, Santa Ana Calvary Chapel won its second 
consecutive State wrestling title Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel dominated the two-day meet to the point that the Eagles had the 
championship wrapped up before the final round began. Calvary Chapel sent eight 
wrestlers to State and three to the finals, where they all won their weight 
classes. The Eagles finished with a State-record 120.5 points. Runner-up Moreno 
Valley Canyon Springs produced 81.5 points and two champions -- brothers Norman 
Abs (103 pounds) and Stephen Abs (112). 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel had a hard time winning the fans' hearts. After defending State 
champion Dane Valdez -- the heavy favorite to add the 125-pound ribbon to last 
year's 119 -- was upset in the morning semifinals, fans roared their approval. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't get nicer when brother Shane Valdez won the 119 title and was booed 
for his defensive stance. 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Holiday (145) and Ed Mosley (152) also won titles for Calvary Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno Valley Canyon Springs' brothers Norman (103) and Stephen (112) Abs 
became the first brothers to win State titles since Merced High's Adam and Dan 
Cuestas did it in 1977.  
</P>
<P>
 Other individuals victors included two-time winners Eric Guerrero (130) of San 
Jose Independence and Casey Strand (189) of Pleasant Hill College Park, Artemio 
Flores (125) of Union City James Logan and Juan Alvarez (135) of Orange El 
Modena.

VENTURA WINS, 83-76, ADVANCES TO STATE FINALS; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: PIRATES 
WITHSTAND IMPERIAL VALLEY'S SECOND-HALF RALLY, FIND THEMSELVES IN FAMILIAR 
SPOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's getting to be a habit, but one Ventura College men's basketball Coach 
Philip Mathews doesn't want to kick. 
</P>
<P>
 For the third consecutive season, the Pirates advanced to the state 
championships, this time with an 83-76 victory over Imperial Valley in a final 
game of the Southern California regional before a standing-room-only crowd of 
more than 3,500 Saturday night at Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura (34-2) will play a first-round game Thursday in the state final eight 
at the UC Irvine Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The semifinals are Friday and the title game is Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 But getting there wasn't easy.  
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates had to work for everything they got against Imperial Valley 
(21-12) in an extremely physical game, but one in which the visiting coach 
didn't think his team got some crucial foul calls in the waning moments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought our guys were getting hammered and we didn't get the calls and then 
(the Pirates) are making baskets at the other end," Imperial Valley Coach Jeff 
Deyo said. "Those were big turnarounds." 
</P>
<P>
 After cutting the Ventura lead to 43-42 on a three-point basket by Ernie 
Garcia at the halftime buzzer, the Arabs saw Ventura score the first five 
points after intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Pirates, who had not trailed, found themselves tied, 53-53, with 15 
minutes 20 seconds to play in the second half and were looking up at a 
one-point deficit, 58-57, when center Joshua Holt made a basket on an offensive 
rebound about three minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the Pirates pulled away in a flash, behind the shooting of forward 
Brandon Jessie, the rebounding of center Michael Tate and the defense of 
forward Steve Amar. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie scored 14 of his game-high 25 points in the second half and Tate 
pounded the boards to finish with 17 rebounds. Amar, who scored 16 points, 
played a superb defensive game and finished with six steals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just anticipating a lot of the things they were going to do," said 
Amar, a transfer from Oxnard College. 
</P>
<P>
 "Luckily, I was at the right place at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews said the Pirates needed Amar to step it up an additional notch because 
the team's three leading players -- Tate, Jessie and point guard Ramirez -- 
were struggling in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Amar) had to play well tonight," Mathews said. "We could not make a run at 
(the Arabs)." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates tried, but could not gain more than a nine-point edge (39-30) on 
Imperial Valley in the first half.

 Imperial Valley used a tenacious man-to-man cover to harass the Pirates and a 
full-court press that had Ramirez running for his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing I could do about it," said Ramirez about the aggressive 
defense the Arabs deployed on him. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I could do was play. . . . I wanted to play as hard as I could and take 
this team to Irvine." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the final home game for Ramirez, a sophomore from Santa Paula High, who 
has been one of the catalysts for the Ventura squad the past two seasons. He 
finished with 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
 For Ventura, it was the second victory over Imperial Valley this season. The 
Pirates beat the Arabs, 90-71, in a nonconference game in November. but Mathews 
said Imperial Valley improved noticeably. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Maurice Ramsey finished with 14 points and guard Andre Lewis added 13 
for Imperial Valley.

AFTER GIVING FALSE HOPE, CAL LUTHERAN RUNS AWAY, 95-81; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: 
KINGSMEN SNAP SECOND-HALF TIE AT UC SAN DIEGO WITH 10-POINT BURST, ADVANCE TO 
SECTIONAL SEMIFINALS.

<P>
 For the first 24 minutes of Saturday night's NCAA Division III men's 
basketball game between Cal Lutheran and UC San Diego, the host Tritons played 
the Kingsmen to a standoff. 
</P>
<P>
 But 68 seconds later, San Diego trailed by 10 points as Cal Lutheran rolled to 
a 95-81 victory in the second-round game before 1,365 at Triton Gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the fifth in a row for the Kingsmen (25-2), who will play 
Greensboro (N.C.), a 90-77 winner over Christopher Newport (Va.), in a 
sectional semifinal Friday at a site to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of surprised that they tried to run with us like they did, but I'm 
glad they did," Cal Lutheran guard Damon Ridley said. "We had watched them on 
film and we thought we could beat them up and down the court if they played 
that way for 40 minutes. We felt that we had better athletes than they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Ability notwithstanding, San Diego (21-5) tied the score, 48-48, with 16 
minutes 30 seconds left in the game when Kahlil Allen threw down a two-handed 
dunk. 
</P>
<P>
 The Triton faithful were dancing in the aisles when Allen scored, but they 
were quickly silenced as Cal Lutheran scored 10 consecutive points to take a 
58-48 lead with 15 minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Rupert Sapwell began the run with a three-point play and Paul Tapp followed 
with a three-point shot that gave the Kingsmen a 54-48 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Minehan was called for traveling on the Tritons' ensuing possession and 
he compounded matters by being whistled for a technical foul for arguing the 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapp, who hit eight of eight free throws, converted both foul shots and Jason 
Smith tipped in a missed shot by Ridley to give Cal Lutheran a 58-48 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 UC San Diego couldn't get closer than five points after that as the Kingsmen 
converted 15 of 18 free throws over the final 3 1/2 minutes to advance to the 
round of 16 for the second time in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels extra good because we had to come down here to play even though we 
were the No. 1-ranked team in the nation," Ridley said. "But I guess it really 
didn't matter where we played this game, because we're going to have to win on 
the road anyway if we want to get to the final four." 
</P>
<P>
 Tapp scored a game-high 23 points for Cal Lutheran and Sapwell and Ridley each 
added 20. Sapwell had 19 points and a game-high 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapp extended his consecutive free-throw shooting streak to 35 with an 
eight-for-eight performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, Matt Aune and Erik Johnson each scored 15 points for the Tritons, who 
had won eight in a row and 15 of their previous 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran led, 46-42, at halftime after going on a 7-2 run to end the first 
20 minutes of play. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Lusain hit a pair of free throws with 1:13 left to give the Tritons a 
40-39 lead, but Tapp countered with a three-point shot for the Kingsmen and 
followed that with a layup after intercepting UC San Diego's inbounds pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Minehan hit a short jump shot to narrow the Tritons' deficit to 44-42, but a 
Clark putback of a Sapwell miss gave Cal Lutheran a 46-42 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen had a great opportunity to go into the locker room with a 
six-point lead, but Sapwell missed a pair of free throws with three seconds 
remaining. Clark had 16 points for Cal Lutheran, followed by Sapwell with nine 
and Ridley with eight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen hit 18 of 34 shots and converted eight offensive rebounds into 13 
points on second or third chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Lusain led Sa Diego with 11 points and Johnson added 10.

CSUN COUNTS ON SMALER IN 18-6 LAUGHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Say this about Cal State Northridge catcher Josh Smaler. He can definitely 
count. 
</P>
<P>
 Informed that he had doubled his seasonal run-batted-in total during 
Saturday's nonconference rout of UC Santa Barbara, Smaler was hardly shocked. 
Nor impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I know," said Smaler, who hit his first homer. "I'm well aware of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 News that he'd finally raised his batting average above the infamous Mendoza 
Line -- to .228 -- was no earthshaker either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Know that, too," he said. "First time above .200 since the first weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 Smaler and his Northridge mates continued their Get-Well Weekend by routing 
Santa Barbara, 18-6, at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaler, a junior transfer from Pierce College, drove in a career-high four 
runs, which made him the celebrity of the split-second. First baseman Jason 
Shanahan and designated hitter Eric Gillespie each had four RBIs and outfielder 
Joey Arnold added three. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (8-9) set season highs in runs and hits (17) as every starter but 
Kevin Howard had at least one hit -- and Howard walked three times. 
</P>
<P>
 In three victories in as many games at brand-new Uyesaka Stadium, the Matadors 
have scored 38 runs against the struggling Gauchos (4-15). 
</P>
<P>
 "We play with confidence here," said Smaler in a masterpiece of 
understatement. "It's always nice to feel like you can come out and score some 
runs." 
</P>
<P>
 Some? The Matadors scored a season-high nine in the third inning alone, 
battering both starter Pat Treend (0-4) and reliever Scott Randall. 
</P>
<P>
 After Treend failed to record an out while loading the bases in the third, 
Randall, a freshman, was summoned. Then hammered. 
</P>
<P>
 In one-third of an inning, he hit two batters and gave up six runs on five 
hits. A three-run triple by Shanahan on an 0-and-2 pitch was the critical blow. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge sent a season-high 14 batters to the plate to take an 11-3 lead, 
more than enough for starter John Najar (3-2), who allowed three runs in the 
first and eighth innings but was never in serious trouble. The same could not 
be said for the Gaucho staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the Northridge offense was Gillespie, who has eight RBIs in three 
games this week. Gillespie, a freshman, is nine for 15 with six RBIs and has 
scored five times in three games against Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortstop Chad Thornhill, second baseman Keyaan Cook, Smaler and Gillespie 
each had three hits. The outburst raised the team batting average 10 points to 
.273. 
</P>
<P>
 "It comes a lot easier," Smaler said, "when everybody is hitting."

ALEMANY WINS, BUT NOT BEFORE GETTING A SCARE; GIRLS' BASKETBALL: UNDEFEATED 
INDIANS SURVIVE KINDLE'S SECOND-HALF POINT BARRAGE TO EDGE SAN BERNARDINO, 
49-46, IN DIVISION II-A CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 San Bernardino High guard LaTonya Kindle was running and gunning, going one on 
five against Alemany, one of the top teams in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 And guess what? The begoggled, superquick, 5-foot-7 junior was winning . 
</P>
<P>
 With 26 points in the second half, Kindle single-handedly rallied the 
Cardinals from an 11-point halftime deficit to a three-point lead with three 
minutes remaining in the Southern Section Division II-A championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alemany, its perfect season in jeopardy, responded by scoring the game's 
final six points to win, 49-46, Saturday at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was getting really scared," Indian forward Samantha Rigley said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But we held our composure. That's why we won the game." 
</P>
<P>
 That composure was tested when Kindle swished a 25-foot jump shot to give San 
Bernardino (25-5) its first lead, 46-43. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany regrouped. Guard Kelly McKay and center Carly Funicello each hit a 
layup and Alemany led, 47-46, with less than a minute to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the Indians (28-0) missed three consecutive free throws -- including 
a rare brick by Rigley on the front end of a one and one with 15 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino's Tanisha Lebrane rebounded the miss but began to fall and had 
to throw the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
 A wild scramble ensued. Players from both teams dived for the ball and 
collided.  
</P>
<P>
 The ball squirted out from a pyramid of players to Alemany point guard Jen 
Stoughton with seven seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoughton was intentionally fouled by Kindle, who had bedeviled the 5-2 
sophomore all game. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweet revenge. She hit both free throws to seal the victory, Alemany's second 
section title in three seasons. Last season, the Indians lost to Morningside in 
a section final. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to hand it to these kids," Alemany Coach Melissa Hearlihy said. 
"When the ball was rolling on the ground at the end of the game . . . there 
were (Alemany) shirts diving on the ball. I think that was the difference in 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the narrowest margin of victory this season for Alemany, which won its 
first four playoff games by an average of 28.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "All our friends say, 'You guys are boring to watch,' " Rigley said. 
"Whatever. I definitely prefer a blowout." 
</P>
<P>
 A one-sided game appeared likely when Alemany led, 24-13, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 But LaTonya re-Kindled San Bernardino's hopes with that stunning second-half 
highlight show. 
</P>
<P>
 No one could slow her barrage. Fadeaway jumpers, 25-foot three pointers, 
one-handed circus shots in the lane, layups. They all seemed to go in. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hearlihy: "I think if I could ever figure out one thing in coaching, I'd 
like to know how to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Kindle made 11 of 21 shots in the half while spearheading the stirring 
comeback. Overall, she had 34 points and eight steals, and took 34 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alemany won the game, but San Bernardino touched every heart that was 
watching," Cardinal Coach Tony Selph said. "And especially LaTonya. If there 
was a little kid watching her play, I'm sure she inspired him, too." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Indians' story is inspiring in its own right. 
</P>
<P>
 They have overcome the loss of guard Kathy Brown to a knee injury, and the 
closure of their gym and their school because of damage suffered in the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 McKay, exhausted after the game, told reporters the team's motto: "You can 
shake us, but you can't break us."

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / PAIGE A. LEECH: A CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH IS NEVER FIT TO BE TIED 
</P>

 It's a ridiculous way to determine a champion. In fact, it doesn't even 
determine one. It determines two. 
</P>
<P>
 When teams play for a title, the game isn't over until there is a winner and a 
loser. A champion and a runner-up. Period. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently the world of soccer has a more egalitarian view. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark and Calabasas highs played to a 1-1 tie Friday in a Southern Section 
Division V final and were declared co-champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Come on. Co-championships are so . . . unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
 To the victor goes the spoils. Now, that's the spirit. None of this sharing 
stuff in a championship. It's ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the ninth boys' soccer co- championship since section title matches 
began in 1964. By now, section officials should have figured out a more 
decisive tiebreaker scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Moorpark Coach Michael Scanlon, who watched his top-ranked Musketeers play 
more aggressively than Calabasas, only to finish with a tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think these boys would have rather played until they dropped," Scanlon 
said. "I know my guys would have." 
</P>
<P>
 After regulation play, the teams were deadlocked, 1-1. They played two 
10-minute overtime periods, but remained tied. Interestingly, from this point 
on, tiebreakers differ in preliminary-round playoff matches from the 
championship match. 
</P>
<P>
 In preliminary-round playoff matches, teams play two 10-minute sudden-death 
periods after the two 10-minute overtime periods. Then, if the teams remain 
tied, penalty kicks determine a winner in all Southern Section playoff games 
except the final. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think a championship should ever be determined on penalty kicks, 
because then you're just a champion of penalty kicks," Scanlon said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Scanlon would have liked to play the sudden-death periods in the 
championship match. And there is no reason not to play sudden death. 
</P>
<P>
 But after 100 minutes of soccer Friday, there was no loser, only two 
champions. Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 While Calabasas players openly relished the co-championship, the Musketeers, 
who had previously beaten and tied Calabasas in Frontier League play, hung 
their heads in disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you would have walked on the field, you would have thought we lost," 
Scanlon said. 
</P>
<P>
 A sportswriter counted 18 shots on goal by Moorpark and three by Calabasas. 
Moorpark's statistician had a 26-8 count. But the match isn't won by shots on 
goal any more than a baseball game is won by the number of runners to reach 
base. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soccer is unique in that you can defend and defend and defend -- or else you 
can go out and try to win it," said Scanlon, summing up the two teams' 
approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The absurdity of the co-championships is clear when one considers that the 
Valley region had not produced a Southern Section soccer champion since Harvard 
won the small schools division in 1990. Now the region features two champions . 
. . but just one title. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Tale of twos: The Harvard-Westlake and Burroughs highs boys' soccer teams each 
played without two of their best players in Division III semifinal matches last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The results, however, differed drastically. 
</P>
<P>
 Without junior midfielders Brian Angelini (suspended for receiving two yellow 
cards in the previous match) and Warren Davidoff (sprained ankle), 
Harvard-Westlake (20-5-3) lost to Bell Gardens, 1-0, in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Burroughs -- without top players Anthony Perico (broken leg) and Juan Almaguer 
(sprained ankle) -- defeated Brea-Olinda, 2-0, to advance to the Division III 
final. 
</P>

 Buena is bueno: Now that the Buena girls' basketball team has made it to five 
consecutive Southern Section finals -- winning twice -- people are coming out 
of nowhere to claim a small portion of the credit. Buena defeated Mater Dei, 
50-41, Friday night for its second consecutive Division I-A title. With only 
two seniors on this season's squad, the Bulldogs are likely to be a force for 
years to come. The future is freshman Nicole Greathouse, a 6-foot-1 center and 
the first off the bench for the Bulldogs, who will continue their quest for a 
state title with regional playoffs this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Greathouse honed her basketball skills on the Ventura Stars youth team, 
she took her initial instruction from the son of her baby-sitter, Jim Friery, 
who is now the Van Nuys baseball coach. "I think I was the first one to teach 
her how to dribble," said Friery, rather coyly. 
</P>
<P>
 Greathouse went to Jean Friery's home for day care for several years in her 
youth. One day Jim Friery instructed a 6-year-old Greathouse to dribble the 
ball once and stop. Twice and stop. Three times and stop, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 Greathouse, averaging 9.4 points and 7.2 rebounds a game, was thoroughly 
engrossed by her new drill and dribbled all the way home, according to Friery. 
Later that evening, Friery and his mother received a call from an excited 
Greathouse. "She went from three (bounces) to 500 in one afternoon," Friery 
said. "She was such a dedicated player -- even at that age." 
</P>
<P>
 Greathouse continues to improve by leaps and bounds, according to Buena Coach 
Joe Vaughan. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's about a year and half away from playing like Michelle Giordano," 
Vaughan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite a compliment considering Giordano has committed to Arizona and averages 
17.9 points a game.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: HAWAII MIGHT FIND ROUGH GOING ON NORTHRIDGE INFIELD

 In the off-season, in an attempt to help rid Matador Field of its reputation 
as the worst baseball facility in NCAA Division I, about $25,000 was spent 
installing and nurturing a new infield. 
</P>
<P>
 The old one was a bit rocky and uneven. In fact, a Northridge school 
administrator said Hawaii complained about the surface after a Western Athletic 
Conference series at Matador Field last season. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hawaii rolls into town Friday to begin WAC play, the infield surface 
might be in comparable shape. Because of earthquake-related developments, there 
is no water for the field's sprinkler system. 
</P>
<P>
 Players and coaches, armed with a single garden hose fed by a lone faucet 
behind the grandstands, are watering the field manually.  
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Coach Bill Kernen said the infield is rock-hard and getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty soon, it'll be like a parking lot," Kernen groused. CAL STATE

 Elbowing Into the Schedule 
</P>
<P>
 Sports Illustrated's well-documented cover curse has nothing on these guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Northridge senior right-hander Steven Morales was pictured on the 
front of the team's baseball pocket schedule. He missed the season because of 
elbow problems. 
</P>
<P>
 A photo of senior right-hander Keven Kempton graces the pocket schedule this 
year. He will miss the season because of elbow problems.

 Third baseman Tyler Nelson had a "fan club" during last week's Gator Slug-Fest 
in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, he was adopted by a group of obnoxious fans as their whipping boy. It 
all started when Nelson made a couple of fielding mistakes early in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that, they were all over me," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything Nelson did was serenaded with a cavalcade of taunts. The group 
included a teen-ager and one lava-lunged female -- who was the most verbal of 
the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 For some reason, she appeared at every Northridge game and was dogged in her 
dogging of the junior infielder. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was definitely loud," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Upon further review. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The way freshman Eric Gillespie remembers it, he hit two home runs last season 
as a senior at Millikan High. And that's what it says in the Northridge media 
guide, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillespie leads the Matadors in homers (three), extra-base hits (nine) and 
runs batted in (23). Quite a haul for a guy who hit only two homers in his 
final year of high school. Granted, the team played at spacious Blair Field in 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait. It gets better. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Gillespie's father, Richard, Eric hit only one homer as a senior. 
Father recently mentioned this minor statistical oversight to his son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess he's right," Eric shrugged.

 Oliver Heitmann is averaging 6.0 kills per volleyball game this season and if 
Coach John Price has his way, that number will increase as the season goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitmann, a 6-foot-7 junior middle blocker from Hamburg, Germany, had 30 kills 
in Thursday's 15-12, 17-15, 15-4 loss to UCLA, but Price hinted that setter 
Gary Reznick should go to him more often. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gary finally figured out that Oliver can hit the ball from the back row," 
Price said sarcastically. "He finally figured out that you're allowed to do 
that. . . . Oliver is by far our best hitter. He should be getting the ball 100 
times a night if that's what the match calls for." 
</P>
<P>
 Heitmann had only three attacking errors in 41 attempts against UCLA for a 
hitting percentage of .659.

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: OREGON SUITS WILSON AFTER ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Sara Wilson had almost stopped dreaming. Three seasons of repeated 
disappointments in her college basketball career made Wilson, a senior center 
from Hart High, almost stop expecting the achievements she always had believed 
were attainable at Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Her freshman season was cut short by a stress fracture in a shin. Oregon 
finished 9-9 in Pacific 10 Conference play and failed to qualify for the 
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 -- She was limited to 13 games in her sophomore season because of a stress 
fracture in her right foot and a bout with mononucleosis. The Ducks fell to 
6-12 in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Her junior season ended with two games left because of a torn anterior 
cruciate ligament in her right knee. Oregon slumped to 3-15 in the Pac-10 and 
Coach Elwin Heiny was fired after 17 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was ridiculous," Wilson said of her misfortune. She had expected success 
when she arrived in Eugene, a Pac-10 championship, perhaps. At least an NCAA 
Tournament berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the expectations and those faraway dreams are materializing. The 
Ducks are in third place in the Pac-10 at 12-4. And the 6-foot-3 Wilson is one 
big reason for the turnaround. She is averaging 15.2 points and 8.5 rebounds a 
game in conference play while leading Pac-10 players in shooting percentage at 
58.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could not have written a better script," said Wilson, 20, who is also 
injury free. "I cannot put it into words. It's so satisfying. It's been more 
than I hoped for." 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon (18-7) has won 11 of its past 13. A 72-60 loss to Stanford on Saturday 
ended a seven-game winning streak that was the school's longest since it joined 
the Pac-10 in 1986-87. With two conference games left, the Ducks are two games 
behind conference leader USC (14-2) and one back of second-place Stanford 
(13-3). After starting the season 7-7, the Ducks stand a good chance of at 
least getting an at-large berth in the expanded 48-team NCAA Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to look back on this season and say, 'If only . . .,' " Wilson 
said. "This is a huge turnaround. I expected good things out of this team. But 
I know a lot of people had doubts with a new coach coming in." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said she liked Heiny but she is impressed by how Jody Runge's 
disciplined approach and match-up zone defense has worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't been a hard change," Wilson said. "It's been a good one. We had two 
girls quit the team, but I was looking on the positive side, and the team has 
adapted to a new system." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has been a model of consistency at Oregon, particularly as a shooter. 
She began the week with 901 points and would be much closer to 1,000 if not for 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of my shots are layups," she said. "I just don't think about 
(statistics). I just go out there and do my role." 
</P>
<P>
 More important to Wilson, who was part of two Southern Section championships 
at Hart, is winning. "We realize where we're at and where we can go," she said. 
"We don't take any win for granted or any team lightly, because we know what 
it's like to be at the bottom." 
</P>

 Checking the fax: North Carolina's Marion Jones (Thousand Oaks) has been named 
to the Atlantic Coast Conference all-freshman team. The 5-10 guard is averaging 
15.5 points, 3.8 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 3.3 steals. Her total of 87 steals 
ranks sixth in the school's record book for a single season. The Tar Heels, 
ranked fifth in the nation by Associated Press, headed into this weekend's ACC 
tournament with a 24-2 record. . . . In men's basketball, Oklahoma's Calvin 
Curry (Ventura College) scored 32 points, including 10 three-point goals, in a 
92-84 victory at Colorado on Wednesday. Curry, who was 10 of 16 from 
three-point range, gave the Sooners the lead for good when he hit his final 
three-pointer, sparking a 12-2 run that gave Oklahoma an 80-78 edge with 4:11 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 In baseball, California freshman second baseman Dan Cey (El Camino Real) leads 
the Bears in batting average (.386), runs (11), hits (17), triples (2), total 
bases (24) and slugging percentage (.667). . . . Arizona State center fielder 
Jacob Cruz (Channel Islands) is batting .410 and has 17 runs batted in and four 
home runs. He share the team lead in runs with 21. His 30-game hitting streak, 
fourth longest in Arizona State history, came to an end against Stanford last 
week. Cruz's streak started with 14 games left last year.

GRANT DOES IT ON 3RD ATTEMPT; GIRLS' SOCCER: LANCERS DEFEAT SAN PEDRO, 1-0, 
TAKE CITY TITLE ON HUFANGA'S SECOND-HALF GOAL. 
</P>

 Grant High became the second school in girls' soccer's six-year history to win 
the City Section title as it beat San Pedro, 1-0, Saturday at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers (12-3-2) celebrated their school's first title in three final 
appearances with bursting bottles of apple cider and a ceremonial drenching of 
Coach John Robb. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous times Grant made it to the finals, including last season, the 
Lancers lost to five-time City Section champion Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't matter what team we met at the final, we were going to win," said a 
jubilant Robb. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant's second-half goal by sophomore Ana Hufanga snapped San Pedro's winning 
streak at 10 matches and marked the Peninsula team's only loss in City 
competition this season.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the low score, Grant dominated throughout, ending the first half with 
seven shots on goal while holding the Pirates to only two tries. The midfield 
was contained and Lancer goalkeeper Kristen Kiley-Boynton made only one save in 
each half. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior striker Nicole Bucciarelli was Grant's mastermind and at times seemed 
like the only player on the field. During the first half she took two shots on 
goal and set up three scoring chances. She followed with four more shots in the 
second half and set up Hufanga's goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, we had kickball going on. This year we had a lot of ball control," 
said Bucciarelli, who ended the season with 43 goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Four minutes into the second half, Bucciarelli drove the ball from the 
midfield to the right side of the Pirates' goal box.  
</P>
<P>
 She found Hufanga at the top of the box with a low pass between two defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Hufanga trapped the ball with her right foot, made a fake while switching the 
ball to her left foot and blasted it past a diving Victoria Brucker. 
</P>
<P>
 The acrobatic Brucker made 11 saves. Without her at the goal mouth, the 
Lancers probably would have scored more.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, San Pedro (11-6) had trouble penetrating the back line, which was 
fortified by Marrica Pichaikul and team captain Zulma Leiva. 
</P>
<P>
 In the boys' final that followed, Belmont (10-1-2) upset top-seeded Bell 
(12-1-1), 1-0.

LOPEZ, SYLVESTER LIFT CAMPBELL HALL, 46-43; BOYS' BASKETBALL: EXPERIENCE OF 
SENIOR PAIR EVIDENT AS VIKINGS DEFEAT PASADENA POLY FOR DIVISION V-AA TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Campbell Hall High center Alex Lopez got an assist from point guard Harold 
Sylvester in an unconventional way Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvester buried three three-point shots in the second half, opening the 
inside game for Lopez, and the Vikings rallied to win the Southern Section 
Division V-AA championship with a 46-43 victory over Pasadena Poly before 2,000 
at Pepperdine's Firestone Fieldhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The title is the second for Campbell Hall in three seasons. The Vikings won 
the championship in 1992 and were ineligible in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, a 6-foot-11 four-year starter who will attend Washington next season, 
finished with 19 points and six blocked shots. His biggest points came with 
just over one minute left when he completed a three-point play that put the 
Vikings ahead, 43-37. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena Poly rallied to close within one point with six seconds to play, but 
Viking forward Jim Snodgrass calmly hit two free throws with four seconds left. 
The Panthers couldn't get off a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell Hall (21-8) claimed the lead for good with 2:15 to play when 
Sylvester (14 points) hit his fourth three-pointer for a 40-37 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvester, a shooting guard for most of the year, moved to point guard when 
Damon Glymph was lost for the season with a foot injury the last week of the 
regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just needed to put up good shots," said Sylvester, a senior. "Alex and I 
refused to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvester's outside shooting helped free the lane for Lopez, who was pushed 
and held for most of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harold and I have this connection since we've played together to so long," 
Lopez said. "We could have lost but the enthusiasm we had pulled us through." 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena Poly (21-5) was led by senior forward Cameron Murphy with 12 points 
and a game-high 13 rebounds, nine in the second half. Scott and Tenere Williams 
each added nine points. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell Hall got a boost from Justin Wallace, starting for Mike Appel, who 
was sidelined with a pulled tendon in his thigh. Appel was replacing Glymph in 
the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace didn't score, but he grabbed seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 After a ragged start, both teams slowed the pace. Each had only one possession 
over a two-minute stretch late in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by eight points from Lopez, Campbell Hall held a 17-8 lead early in the 
second quarter before Pasadena Poly started to hit outside shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took us about a quarter to adjust and play because Lopez is so darn big," 
Panther Coach Brad Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers went on a 6-0 run to end the first half after Lopez picked up his 
second personal foul and cut Campbell Hall's lead to 22-21 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost the lead because Snodgrass wasn't in there," Viking Coach Jon Palarz 
said. "He knows our offensive spacing best and how to get people away from 
Alex, but he was in foul trouble too." 
</P>
<P>
 Snodgrass was called for two fouls early in the first quarter and did not play 
much the rest of the first half.

BELL GARDENS BLANKETS PEREZ, DEFEATS BURROUGHS FOR TITLE; BOYS' SOCCER: 
INDIANS' SCORING STAR HELD TO A SINGLE SHOT ON GOAL DURING 3-1 LOSS IN SOUTHERN 
SECTION DIVISION III CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Burroughs High boys' soccer team made its first appearance in the Southern 
Section Division III finals Saturday, but the Indians didn't take home the 
championship plaque. 
</P>
<P>
 They lost, 3-1, to Bell Gardens in a physical game at Gahr High that included 
four yellow cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Burroughs, which went into the match with a 12-game winning streak, ended the 
season with a 16-6-2 record. Bell Gardens, winner of three Southern Section 
championships, finished at 21-5-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers came out with a simple but effective plan: cover Burroughs star 
scorer Roberto Perez like a blanket. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior had seven goals in four playoff games and a total of 17 this 
season. He also has a school career record 55. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our game plan was to keep No. 13 (Perez) off the ball as much as possible," 
Bell Gardens Coach Orlando Brenes said. "We did it and it worked."  
</P>
<P>
 At times Perez was double- and triple-teamed. He took only one shot in the 
entire match, with about two minutes left to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everytime I had the ball I had at least two guys on me," Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They played great defense. They really have a great team. They were tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Gardens' Gustavo Garita scored the match's first goal at the 47:08 mark.  
</P>
<P>
 The junior defender scored the Lancers' goal in overtime in the Southern 
Section semifinals against Harvard-Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday he dribbled past three Burroughs players inside the penalty box 
and drilled the shot from the left side. 
</P>
<P>
 About three minutes later, the Lancers' Jamie Olivarez took almost the same 
shot to give his team a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior midfielder Gret Guenther scored the Indians' only goal at 59:41. Bell 
Gardens goalie Luis Ayala jumped up to save a shot taken by Burroughs' Juan 
Hernandez. When he landed and threw the ball down with both hands, Guenther 
kicked it in from the left corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was kind of falling so all I had to do was keep going and put it in," 
Guenther said. 
</P>
<P>
 With less than two minutes left in the game, senior defender Robert Arredondo 
scored on a penalty kick, after Burroughs was called for a handball.  
</P>
<P>
 "We knew both teams would get chances to score, but the difference is they 
finished up the opportunities," Burroughs Coach Mike Kodama said. "We expected 
them to cover (Perez) but we were hoping that would create space for other 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Kodama said it was exciting to have made it one step further in the playoffs 
this year. Last season the Indians, winners of three consecutive Foothill 
League titles, lost in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really proud," he said. "This was not expected of this team. It's amazing 
we got this far."

FRIENDS OUTSIDE; A YEAR-OLD ST. VINCENT DE PAUL SOCIETY PROGRAM HELPS ORANGE 
COUNTY GANG MEMBERS, JUVENILE CRIMINALS AND OTHER AT-RISK YOUTHS WITH 
COUNSELING, REFERRALS AND A PLACEMENT SERVICE TO FIND JOBS. SO FAR, EMPLOYERS 
HAVE BEEN RECEPTIVE. 
</P>

<P>
 Assume you're trying to land a job during a time when the economic pendulum is 
barely beginning to swing up. Assume further that you have little or no 
experience at any job of any kind. And, by the way, you have a recent criminal 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as much of the world of employment is concerned, you're persona non 
grata.  
</P>
<P>
 That is what sticks in the craw of many at-risk youths, who let the idea of an 
actual job linger in their minds for an instant before the memory of wary 
stares in public places demolishes it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They drive through a fast food restaurant (for a meal)," says Al Hanna, "and 
they say that people look at them only as gang bangers. They have a very low 
comfort level there, very low self-esteem. After all, if you can't walk into a 
place like that (to eat), how can you walk into the Disney offices for a job 
interview?" 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Javier Rivera has done just that. The 17-year-old from Garden Grove, 
who recently served time in Orange County Juvenile Hall for auto theft, made 
what he and his new group of friends consider to be a solid showing in a pair 
of interviews for a staff position at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier is one of a handful of juvenile offenders who have gotten a leg up on a 
job with the help of a year-old program called Friends Outside, sponsored by 
the St. Vincent de Paul Society of Orange County. Designed as a counseling, 
referral and placement service for gang members, other at-risk youths and 
juvenile criminals who might otherwise never consider interviewing for a job, 
Friends Outside grew out of a more conventional style of jailhouse ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a year ago, said Hanna, a program volunteer, the society had been 
conducting Bible studies and one-on-one counseling with youths in detention, 
"but to be more productive, we thought we ought to be able to make a bridge 
between their release and potential employment. We could talk a good fight, but 
we took it a step further to actually meet Mr. Employer." 
</P>
<P>
 And, so far, Mr. Employer appears to be receptive. At a job fair held last 
month by Friends Outside, 104 young people and several representatives of area 
companies -- including Disney, Carl's Jr. and St. Joseph Hospital -- got a 
closer look at each other and apparently liked what they saw. Five kids are 
working in regular jobs they found through the program, and almost another 20 
are actively looking and interviewing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these kids are at greater risk of recidivism to juvenile hall than 
many of their peers, said juvenile hall director Tom Wright. In a recent study, 
more than 6,000 juvenile offenders were tracked through the justice system and, 
Wright said, 70% never returned to juvenile hall. Another 22% were back a 
second or third time; the remaining 8% returned more often -- as many as 13 
times. Many of the youths who go to the Friends Outside program, Wright said, 
are probably in that troubled 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 But some employers apparently don't see that status as an automatic stigma. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The employers) realize that these are people coming from a troubled 
background who have a desire to break out of that," Hanna said. "There are 
negatives in that many employers are not hiring anybody right now, and they may 
think, 'Why would I want to hire an at-risk kid when I could hire somebody 
white collar?' But they say they'll talk to the kids, and they're more willing 
after they talk. They see that it's a benefit to the entire community in that 
this kid, if he's hired, now becomes a role model." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is how Javier is beginning to see himself. Involved in the Friends 
Outside program for about 2 1/2 months, Javier says he now feels comfortable 
with the program staff and is making a strong effort to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're nice people here, and it does help in (juvenile hall) to think about 
doing better, but when you're outside, it's not so easy," he said. "When you 
get out, you can get back into doing the same things. I'm trying to stay out of 
trouble now: no hanging out with the homies." 
</P>
<P>
 Partly as a result of his positive attitude, Javier said he was treated 
cordially during his two interviews, "not like just this criminal." 
</P>
<P>
 Javier's open-arm reception was helped by a bit of tutoring beforehand. 
Interview candidates are briefed by the Friends Outside staff on what they can 
expect to hear and see in an interview and are coached on basic job interview 
techniques, even appearance. Because many of the young people don't own clothes 
appropriate for a job interview, arrangements are sometimes made with the St. 
Vincent de Paul clothing center in Orange.  
</P>
<P>
 It was requests for just that sort of help that spawned the Friends Outside 
jobs program, said Joan O'Brien, a volunteer. During the seven years she worked 
as a volunteer at juvenile hall, O'Brien said, the youths serving time would 
constantly ask her for help and advice about getting jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't comfortable with the whole job situation," she said. "It was 
difficult for them to imagine. That's when Al (Hanna) and I got together on it. 
We knew we couldn't just put somebody in a $5-an-hour job and tell them that 
this is what it is to work. That wouldn't do it. They also had to know what to 
expect down the line. They needed a friend, some support, not just someone to 
throw them into a job and forget about them." 
</P>
<P>
 And not just the job applicants themselves, but other members of their family. 
Friends Outside, said program coordinator Sandi Burns, also makes provisions 
for siblings of juvenile offenders and offers them counseling and, in some 
cases, a chance to work at paid jobs or volunteer positions. Family support 
groups meet at the St. Vincent de Paul headquarters in Orange once a week, 
Burns said, and many young family members -- generally from age 14 to 17 -- are 
assisted by Sister Rose Marie Redding, the program's job developer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them are living in amazing situations," said Burns, "in which not one 
but both parents may be incarcerated, and the kids are living with 
grandparents. They have special needs that we try to address." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, she said, family members visit the headquarters spontaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the kids," Burns said, "just like to come in and answer phones, just 
to be around the atmosphere here." 
</P>
<P>
 The nondenominational program, Burns said, can use them. It's being run by 
four staff members and three interns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no budget for the jobs program," she said. "It's a leap of faith. 
I've written several grants and been turned down for several. We're going to 
fight for what we believe, but right now we're taking baby steps." 
</P>
<P>
 As is Carlos Madrigal -- though his steps seem solid. Carlos, 17, who lives in 
Santa Ana, is working three days a week at an entry-level job at Independent 
Forge, a manufacturer of aircraft parts based in Orange. He is shy, smiles 
easily and appears to enjoy learning how to de-burr the aluminum parts with a 
compressed-air grinding tool. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what it's like," said Rosemary Ruiz, co-owner of the business. "You're 
young; you're scared; you don't know what the heck you're doing. But he's doing 
good. Eventually, I know I'll find a little niche for him, something he'll 
really like. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that all of them, all young people, we've got to give them a chance, 
because that's the future of America. But I'm not doing it because I feel sorry 
for them. They're earning their keep. This is important, though, because it 
will open the eyes of other business owners. I feel strongly that businesses 
can fit in a little one here and there. Why not help somebody? God will help 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Carlos smiles at the prospect of his first paycheck and even 
ventures a thought about the future. He admits that if he weren't on the 
factory floor, he'd "probably be on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "(But) if I keep this up," he says, "I'll probably stay here."

ROBIN ABCARIAN: MAKING A DIFFERENCE, ONE YOUNG WOMAN AT A TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Just before noon, the mothers arrive at the day-care center. They join their 
children for lunch at small picnic tables on the enclosed blacktopped yard. To 
an outsider, it looks as though the children are eating with their much older 
siblings -- that's because the mothers are still in their teens. They are 
students at Business Industry School, an L.A. Unified adult vocational facility 
that offers day care to its teen-age mothers for $5 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a hard life for these young women. Most are single, many are in abusive 
relationships with their boyfriends, many live with other family members in 
crowded apartments. They are striving for high-school diplomas and better 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 I sat on a bench with 19-year-old Claudia as her 3-year-old, Jerry, played 
nearby. Claudia and Jerry live four blocks from the school in a two-bedroom 
apartment with Claudia's parents, her four brothers and her grandmother. 
Claudia and Jerry sleep together on the bottom of a bunk bed. Jerry, she says, 
irritates her brothers, and the tension is constant. Two weeks ago, Jerry's 
20-year-old father broke up with Claudia. As she told me this, her eyes 
reddened. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were planning so much stuff," she said. She picked at her acrylic nails. A 
tear rolled down her check. "We were talking about getting married." 
</P>
<P>
 To say that these young mothers and their children are vulnerable to the 
plagues we often blame for the disintegration of this city -- crime, 
unemployment, poverty, drugs -- is to state the obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is: Can the course be altered, the cycle broken? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One evening last week, I sat in a small, comfortable office at a local 
hospital with 10 women and began to feel a glimmer of hope. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a support group -- meeting for the first time since six of the women 
had become mentors to six teen-age mothers of the Business Industry School. The 
Teen Parent Mentor Project, which began in January, is administered by the 
Early Childhood Center, a nonprofit group dedicated to the healthy development 
of children. It is run out of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center by Karen Pomer and 
Janis Minton, in coordination with Ruth Beaglehole, the indefatigable director 
of Business Industry's teen-parenting and day-care program. 
</P>
<P>
 Mentors and mothers were matched after a series of interviews and meetings. 
The mentors come from all walks of life: a union organizer, a police officer, a 
radio executive, an office manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to make a difference in someone's life," said Bonita Dent, 41, chief 
financial officer for FM radio station V103.9. "I want to work with someone who 
wants to improve her life. . . . You start with one person and then maybe they 
will be able to reach out and help someone one day." 
</P>
<P>
 Mona Lisa Fortenberry, a 38-year-old mother of four sons, runs a day-care 
center for infants. She felt drawn to Jessica, 18, the mother of a toddler. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was just something about Jessica. I wanted her. I felt she had 
something to offer me," said Fortenberry. "She has qualities that need to be 
watered. She is like dry land that is cracked." 
</P>
<P>
 Pomer smiled: "Jessica was telling her friends at school, 'My mentor picked me 
!' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Like a wanted baby," Beaglehole said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Claudia first heard about the program, she didn't think she would 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the mentor wouldn't like me," she said. "I thought I would bore 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Claudia ended up with Linda Garcia, a high school career counselor who helped 
with a resume that landed Claudia a job in an insurance office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Linda has helped me in every way," Claudia said. "I call her when I need to 
talk. We have everything in common." 
</P>
<P>
 At the support meeting, Garcia was concerned about the number of hours Claudia 
has been working. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a problem with a lot of them," Beaglehole said. Too much work equals 
not enough time in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, we talked about whether the job was worth it," Garcia said. "And 
Claudia said, 'But Linda, I need the experience!' Well, she got me there. I am 
a career counselor." 
</P>
<P>
 Mentoring can be tricky. The mentors seem to have so much, the mothers so 
little. Mentors are encouraged, for example, to buy lunch, but to draw the line 
at other purchases -- to trade in a currency of emotional support, not cash. 
And they must constantly fight the urge to judge. As one mentor said, "That's 
our oath: 'We will not be judgmental.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It's too soon to know what difference these relationships will make in the 
lives of the teen mothers, in the lives of their children, in the life of this 
city. But, to borrow the mentor's metaphor, this program seems as full as 
promise as fresh rain on dry soil.

STATE OF THE UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRAD BONHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Preparations for the beach wedding had already begun when Kay Wiker and Daniel 
Holmes got the bad news from the county of Orange: Weddings aren't permitted on 
county beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiker had known what elements he wanted at his wedding even before he fully 
realized, at the age of 18, that he is gay. He wanted a ceremony on the sand 
and under a full moon. His fiance, Holmes, was determined that the 
orchid-covered bamboo wedding arch, illuminated by candles held by each of the 
150 guests and 100 tiki torches, would be part of the ceremony at Laguna's West 
Street beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in a twist both sweet and bitter to the participants, the county allowed 
the event to go on as planned. The event, it seems, would be just a party -- 
not a wedding -- in the eyes of county officials, because the state doesn't 
recognize gay unions as legal marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 So on June 4, 1993, Wiker, 33, and Holmes, 27, exchanged rings while seven 
attendants stood by on the sand. Amid live cello and flute music, two ministers 
read prayers and watched as the San Juan Capistrano couple, in formal attire, 
recited their vows. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a ceremony that Wiker, aware of the apparent irony of the term, 
described as old-fashioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was what I've always wanted to do. I wanted to show Daniel how much I'm 
willing to make a commitment to him, and do it in front of our friends," he 
said. "My straight friends are impressed that we did it so openly. But there 
shouldn't be anything unusual in it. When two gay people want to show their 
commitment, they should be able to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 Commitment ceremonies have increased steadily in recent years, gay-rights 
advocates say, and are helping to fuel litigation efforts to gain state 
recognition of same-sex unions. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognition could come first in Hawaii, where gay-rights lawyers are confident 
of victory in a lawsuit that challenges state policies banning marriage 
licenses for gay and lesbian couples. Such an outcome could put a national 
focus on the issue if gays go to Hawaii to marry and then return to their home 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 "If one state ultimately allows lesbian and gay marriages, there will be 
haggling in each state as to whether or not to recognize those marriages," said 
Rachel Bernstein, a lawyer with the National Center for Lesbian Rights. "And 
there may be cases just like there were with interracial marriages," when the 
U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1967 that Virginia had to recognize the union of an 
interracial couple who had gotten married in another state. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawsuits seeking to force states to recognize gay unions have become a 
priority among many gay-rights lawyers. Legal actions are pending in Florida, 
Arizona and the District of Columbia, and last year the marriage policy in 
California was unsuccessfully challenged by two West Hollywood men who sued 
after the Los Angeles County clerk denied their application for a marriage 
license. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawaii suit may fare best because that state's constitution was amended 
specifically to prohibit government discrimination based on sex, said Evan 
Wolfson of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, which has brought the 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
 In its defense, the state of Hawaii argues that children are best raised by 
their biological parents, that the state has a compelling interest in fostering 
procreation, and that allowing same-sex couples to marry would convey state 
approval of non-heterosexual orientation and behavior. A final decision is 
expected in a year or two. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico and New Jersey may also soon be targeted for marriage-license suits 
because those states' constitutions and case laws show potential for being 
challenged, said J Craig Fong of the Lambda fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no state recognizes gay unions, five California counties and several 
cities do. Los Angeles, West Hollywood and Laguna Beach are among eight 
municipalities that offer varying degrees of recognition of same-sex unions. 
</P>
<P>
 A pending California Assembly bill that would allow gay couples to register 
their relationships is modeled after the policies of these cities. Under the 
measure, which was introduced on Valentine's Day, gays would be able to will 
property to their partners, participate in family-only hospital visits and gain 
conservatorship rights in the event one becomes incapacitated. Similar 
legislation was introduced in Hawaii last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay-rights activists are optimistic about the California bill's chances but 
expect opposition, even though they say the measure, introduced by Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar), falls far short of the benefits offered by marriage licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, these are limited rights, the barest sort of protection," said 
Richard Jennings, executive director of Hollywood Supports, a group that 
addresses HIV and gay issues in the entertainment industry. "The bill doesn't 
put gays on a par with married couples. Gays continue to have relationships, 
buy property together and look into the possibility of adopting children, but 
laws are not set up to address any of these." 
</P>
<P>
 Although gay partners sometimes have lawyers draft contracts and agreements 
that attempt to duplicate marriage benefits, it is estimated that such 
agreements can address only 60% of what is covered in a heterosexual marriage. 
For example, the agreements cannot guarantee the same protections in areas such 
as child custody, pension plans, health coverage and Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, gay-rights activists say that when gays seek court-ordered enforcement 
of the documents, some judges have refused to recognize them. 
</P>
<P>
 Some commitment ceremonies announce the start of a relationship; most affirm 
partnerships that began years or even decades earlier. The ceremonies can also 
be political statements, as when more than 1,000 same-sex couples were 
simultaneously wed during last April's march on Washington. But most of the 
ceremonies -- known variously as same-sex covenants, relationship rituals or 
holy unions -- are private parties held in homes, hotels and churches. 
</P>
<P>
 At Congregation Kol Ami in West Hollywood, Rabbi Denise L. Eger has performed 
hundreds of commitment ceremonies since 1988. She says the rituals often serve 
as a welcome vehicle for hesitant parents to show their support of their gay 
children's relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 Because no official records are kept, the national total of gay households is 
unknown. But the American Bar Assn.'s Family Law Conference has estimated that 
at least 8 million children are being raised in 3 million same-sex households 
nationwide. Nearly all states permit adoption for same-sex couples. 
</P>
<P>
 The notion of gay relationships remains discomforting to many people -- even 
to some who don't consider themselves anti-homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Diocese of the Episcopal Church debated at its recent 
convention whether the blessing of same-sex relationships should be sanctioned. 
After six hours of discussion, delegates failed to reach agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of two women or two men marrying is one that I don't see myself 
theologically able to endorse or accommodate," said the Rev. David Anderson of 
St. James' Episcopal Church in Newport Beach, whose delegation opposed the 
same-sex resolution. "The term marriage has referred to a unique bond between a 
man and a woman, and the old medieval idea of marriage had to do with the 
production of children." 
</P>
<P>
 Episcopal priests who had previously blessed same-sex covenants, such as the 
Rev. George Regas at All Saints in Pasadena, continue to do so, and backers of 
the proposal say they will press the issue at the church's general convention 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Tuttle, pastor of Vineyard Christian Fellowship in Anaheim, says he sees 
homosexuality as a sin but dislikes being lumped together with "angry, hateful 
and militant" opponents of gay rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't condemn gays that way," Tuttle said. "But I wouldn't have the faith 
to (perform) a gay marriage, because I do believe it's not within God's will. 
We see it as a sin, and they don't. We don't condone homosexuality for the same 
reason we don't condone drunkenness, theft or encourage divorce." 
</P>
<P>
 But liberal clerics such as Regas believe that gays should have a welcome home 
in the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "The love of God revealed in the Jewish and Christian Scriptures is an 
inclusive love. That's the predominant theme of biblical literature," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Christian commitment ceremonies for same-sex couples are performed by the 
Metropolitan Community Church, founded in 1968 for gays who feel uncomfortable 
in other churches. The church has more than 300 congregations worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Jane Carl, co-pastor of Ocean of Life MCC in Costa Mesa, has 
performed about 50 same-sex ceremonies. Like heterosexual candidates for 
marriage, gay partners meet at least three times with Carl before the ceremony 
to discuss the emotional, spiritual and legal aspects of their union. Carl 
requires couples to have lived together for at least one year before the 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 The specter of AIDS, she says, has played a role in encouraging long-term gay 
unions, especially among men. "Gay men are becoming much more monogamous in the 
face of AIDS," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the ceremonies that Carl has conducted, 70% have been between women. At 
Congregation Kol Ami, just as many gay men as lesbians take vows, a change from 
the late 1980s, Eger said. She attributes the change to a renewal of the values 
of commitment in the gay male community, prompted by the AIDS crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl estimates that nationally, three of every five commitment ceremonies are 
non-religious. "The reason, I think, is that the church has done so much damage 
to gay and lesbian people spiritually that many are totally convinced that God 
will have no part of them. So they say, why do the ceremony in a church?" 
</P>
<P>
 Chris and Micki Clark of Orange County are among the lesbian couples who chose 
to include Christian passages in their ceremony. The two met through a gay 
dating service last March and tied the knot two months later. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was love at first sight," said Chris, 31, a state employee. "We believe in 
God, and I wanted to have my lifelong partner marry me because it's more of a 
commitment, more bonding. It's not only a religious but a social bond when 
you're out there in front of your friends and family." 
</P>
<P>
 The guest list, which grew from 20 to 42 as more friends and co-workers began 
to show interest in attending, included "gay, straight, old and young," said 
Micki, 27, an administrative assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's parents, however, didn't attend the ceremony. Micki said her 
parents "would rather see us married to guys, but that's their opinion. Gay 
people have the right to be married, too. We're in love." Micki legally changed 
her last name to match Chris'. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the gay couples who are wed at Kol Ami, about 20% have parents who boycott 
the ceremony on principle, Eger says. Twenty-five percent of the parents, she 
adds, are hesitant but find that the ceremony is a way to heal their 
relationship with their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Say the parents are not dealing well with their child's sexual orientation," 
Eger said. "Then they get a call from the child announcing the ceremony. The 
parents resist at first but know they have to do the right thing and show up. 
And it has a positive effect. A wedding is a wedding. There's music and loving 
words said." 
</P>
<P>
 While the courts are deciding whether the definitions of marriage should be 
expanded, increasing numbers of private companies are rewriting their benefits 
policies to include non-traditional couples. Some began by offering health and 
other benefits to the unmarried partners of heterosexual employees and then 
extended the benefit to the partners of gay and lesbian employees. 
</P>
<P>
 When former Apple Computer Chairman John Sculley initiated a benefits program 
for domestic partners last year, his rationale was as American as capitalism, 
said company spokesman Frank O'Mahony. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was concerned that we could have a potential disadvantage recruiting the 
best talent if gay people knew they couldn't get adequate health benefits," 
O'Mahony said. Sculley's competitive pragmatism, the spokesman added, was 
accompanied by a personal belief that denying benefits to committed gay couples 
is simply unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies and institutions offering domestic-partnership benefits 
include Levi Strauss, Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream and Stanford University. The 
entertainment industry is also steadily recognizing the rights of gay 
partnerships, said Jennings of Hollywood Supports, who has helped draft 
policies adopted by MCA/Universal, Warner Bros., Viacom, HBO and the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 Such benefits, however, may not be as lucrative as they seem, according to the 
Partners Task Force for Gay and Lesbian Couples, an advocacy group based in 
Seattle. The Internal Revenue Service calculates the dollar value of 
domestic-partnership benefits and adds that to the working partner's income, 
the task force said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay-rights advocates say the fact that gay unions generally lack job benefits 
and state recognition is proof that the ceremonies are reflections of love 
rather than arrangements of convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing this in spite of the fact that there's no legal or economic 
benefit," said Eger, who has been wed four years to her lesbian partner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we're discriminated against by the state from building stable, 
normative lives, I have people who have been together 18, 20, 24 years. I find 
it ironic that the radical right wants to paint the gay community as 
promiscuous, evildoing and predatory when the reality is (that) gay- and 
lesbian-commitment ceremonies are really about celebrating gay and lesbian 
stability." 
</P>
<P>
 Eger concedes, however, that breakups among gay partners occur nearly as 
frequently as they do in heterosexual marriages. In such cases, she encourages 
gay as well as straight couples to undergo what she calls "a sacred ceremony of 
dissolutionment." 
</P>
<P>
 "I do create ceremonies of closure and separation," Eger said. "In 
(prenuptial) counseling we talk of what happens when the relationship doesn't 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Holmes said his relationship has become stronger since he was wed on 
the moonlit beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd both had previous long-term relationships, and in this one, there's not 
that thought that one of us could walk out the door. This is the most settled 
and loving time I've had in my life."

GALLERY: CRUISE CONTROL 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They used to call her car "Chicken McNugget." But after more than 20 first 
place showings in a host of lowrider customized car competitions, most people 
refer to Linda Lopez's immaculately flame-colored, chromed 1947 Chevrolet 
Fleetmaster by its given name -- "Golden Dream." 
</P>
<P>
 "They used to make fun of it in the beginning," the 43-year-old Westminster 
resident said, "because nobody had ever seen this color before." 
</P>
<P>
 The head-turning vehicle captured back-to-back first place trophies at the 
last two Super Shows, an annual event that attracts lowriders from throughout 
the Southwest and is considered by enthusiasts to be the most prestigious 
national competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez's impressive record with "Golden Dream" has also boosted her standing in 
her auto club, where she enjoys another distinction -- being the only female 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the fact that her husband, Leo Lopez, is president of the Duke's 
Car Club of Orange County didn't exactly hinder her rise. But the couple says 
their shared passion for lowriding has enhanced their marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't really see many husbands and wives that are together with their 
cars," said Leo, 45, a repair technician. "It's one of the things I really 
enjoy with her. It's a strong family bond." MARTIN MILLER

SOCIAL CLIMES; TRAY CHIC; MISS KITTY UPDATES THE '40S CIGARETTE GIRLS WITH 
CAMPY COSTUMES. AMONG THEIR WARES: CANDY AND CONDOMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILLARY JOHNSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Karen Hallock chirps in a cartoon voice that makes the Simpsons sound like 
summer-stock Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cigarettes? Candy? Condoms?" 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday nights, Hallock is a big, beautiful Kewpie doll selling lollipops 
to the Hollywood hip-hop boys who flock to the Gaslight. She's wearing fishnet 
stockings, high heels, a pink and blue crinoline, and a headdress crowned with 
a working jack-in-the-box that her boss, Miss Kitty, played with as a child. 
</P>
<P>
 It's 1 a.m. and a neo-grunge youth approaches Hallock. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much are the cigarettes?" he shouts over the din. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three-fifty," Hallock sings back in her Minnie Mouse falsetto. He recoils. A 
dreadlocked young man in need of candy shoulders past. He pays, tips and goes 
on without a word, sucking on a sour-apple something. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been a good night for Hallock, who will take home from $90 to $130 in 
salary, commission and tips after working the Gaslight from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A student by day, Hallock, 19, is one of a cadre of young women (and men) who 
ply the clubs, parties and concerts in the employ of Miss Kitty's Koncessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Kitty is the invention of Katrina Kaye, who started her career as a 
'40s-style cigarette girl in 1989 after dropping out of the pre-med program at 
UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 Using an antique candy tray she found at an auction, Kaye donned a costume and 
a campy persona, named after the saloon hostess in the TV series "Gunsmoke," 
and took to the clubs of Los Angeles, working out of the trunk of her car. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, at 25, Kaye is headquartered in New York and commands a battalion of 65 
concessionaires in Los Angeles, New York and Dallas. Her empire is soon to 
expand into Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent weekend, she is visiting her Los Angeles outpost, where she 
parties hard by night and runs the business side by day, saying she gets by on 
four to five hours of sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 She is not easy to keep up with, and it isn't easy to land a job as a Miss 
Kitty girl. "They have to be performers and salespeople. First I make them 
sing," Kaye says. "I don't care if they can sing, but if they're game to try, 
that's what I'm looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then we do a lot of role playing, to see how they handle different situations 
-- like how to approach a couple that's starting to get into it in a booth and 
probably could use a condom (packaged in confetti with part of the proceeds 
going to the Los Angeles AIDS Hospice)." 
</P>
<P>
 At 10 on this Saturday night, the Miss Kitty Koncessions dressing room on La 
Cienega resembles Disney's psychedelic dream sequence in which Dumbo gets drunk 
and learns to fly. The otherwise utilitarian accommodations are littered with 
flounces of hot pink, silver, black and peacock blue, with the occasional 
spray-painted polka-dot. Kaye is busy cinching Rolanda Davis into a strapless 
pink leather corset. "It hurts already," Davis complains to no avail. The 
outfit is topped with a tall striped satin cap straight out of a Dr. Seuss 
book. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaye pushes back the marabou sleeves of her black '70s-vintage evening gown 
and says she used to make all the costumes herself. "Now my aunt makes them, 
but I still do the designs. Whenever I'm in L.A. we go out looking for new 
stuff. That one's a shower curtain," she says, pointing to the plastic tutu 
printed with old movie stills worn by tonight's "Hollywood" girl, Shauna 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Each costume has a name. There is "Michael" and "LaToya" and "Silly." 
</P>
<P>
 "All the costumes are my size, and everyone has to fit in them, except for the 
guys," says Kaye, who clocks in at five feet, four inches, although tonight 
she's wearing black leather Converse high-tops to which she's added four inches 
of striped-foam platform. The shoes are prototypes for her line of rave 
clothing called Soap Dodger. 
</P>
<P>
 A felt-tipped pen is handed around the dressing room to dab on the obligatory 
beauty marks. Helen Heaven, clad in a leopard print trimmed with hot pink satin 
and a pillbox hat, writes "Tip Me Please" on her palm. "It actually helps a 
lot," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Williams rushes in late, and Kaye whips a blue satin number off the 
rack. Williams groans. It's the dreaded "Arena" outfit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you have a small car?" Kaye asks. "Because it's hard to drive with these." 
"These" are foot-long exaggerations of the stylized conical breasts Gaultier 
and Madonna copped from New York performance artist Jack Smith. "They used to 
have red nipples," Kaye says, "until some woman in a club bit them off." 
</P>
<P>
 By 11, the dressing room is empty and Kaye sets out to inspect the troops in 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The first stop is Tatou, the ever-so-chic Beverly Hills supper club run by New 
York's Rudolph. Jacqui, a dialogue coach by day, works the floor, resplendent 
in "Michael Jackson," a black and gold sequined Sgt. Pepper number. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been with Kitty since the beginning," Jacqui says. "Four years now." She 
and Kaye squeal, hug and catch up. "I got that job on Ed Asner's show," she 
tells Kaye. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaye had an early career as a club promoter before she became a 
cigarette-candy-condom mogul. En route to the next venue, she tells war stories 
from her days organizing raves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to break into warehouses and throw parties. And we always had several 
alternative spaces lined up in case the police shut us down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we did a party at Union Station Downtown. I built this 20-foot-tall 
mushroom. I had a caterpillar smoking a hookah on top and I was going to be 
dancing around the bottom dressed as Alice. While I was setting up, this guy 
came up and asked if we were having a bar mitzvah. I said, yes. It wasn't until 
4 a.m. that they realized it wasn't a bar mitzvah and shut the party down." 
</P>
<P>
 At Velvet Crush on Western Avenue, Rolanda Davis is stationed on the dance 
floor. She strikes pose after pose, vamping and vogueing for an appreciative 
audience of cool young record industry types. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she might be a model or an actress, she looks surprised. "No, this is 
what I do. This is it." 
</P>
<P>
 At Gaslight, Kaye checks the contents of Karen Hallock's tray, asking which 
things are selling, which are not. A package of Nutter Butter cookies is a 
definite loser. Never again. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving on, Hallock makes slow progress through the crowded bar, the crush of 
bodies pressing against her tray. She smiles and steadies herself on her 
four-inch heels. For the first time, her demeanor suggests that this "fun" job 
is a lot of work.

<TEXT>
<P>
 We don't know much about art, but we know a notorious murderer when we see 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 Through March 15, you can view some 40 oil paintings of serial killer John 
Wayne Gacy at the Galerie at Tatou, the Beverly Hills supper club/nightclub 
complex where the elite meet. Included are original manuscripts from two books 
of Gacy's correspondence, including letters he received from Truman Capote and 
Oprah Winfrey, as well as the paint brushes he used. (Gacy gets no proceeds 
from sales of his works). 
</P>
<P>
 While the exhibition might appeal to those with a love of the macabre, we 
wouldn't suggest it for a first date. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Release of the Cool: Model behavior: If you've been in L.A. for more than a 
day, you know the cardinal rule for how to react when you spot a celebrity: 
Coolness prevails. No shouting, "Hey, look, everybody! It's Warren Beatty! And 
Annette! And their baby!" A sly glance, with a slight rib jab to your friend, 
is all that's necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rule of Nonchalance does not apply, however, when it comes to supermodels. 
We found ourselves at a recent party attended by some of those super-duper 
gals, including Linda Evangelista, Tatiana Patitz and Kate Moss. We soon 
realized that we weren't the only ones gawking. Scads of other looky-loos were 
craning their necks, making no attempts to hide their curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, we wondered? Don't models deserve the same kind of hands-off deference 
that movie, music and TV stars get? We can only guess that they were being 
stared at because people aren't used to seeing them moving and talking in 3-D.  
</P>
<P>
 Or, they could have been staring for the same reason we were staring: Doesn't 
she have at least one zit? One zit ? How about a small red blotch? We'll settle 
for a blotch. Or a thigh bulge. A tiny one will do, really. 
</P>

 He Can Dream, Can't He? We're fascinated -- and always amazed -- by what 
people read while on the machines at the gym to take their minds off the fact 
that their legs feel like hot anvils and their lungs are going to explode -- 
everything from scripts to bestsellers to their own hand-written musings on 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 The other day, we were struck by the portly man reading Chocolatier magazine 
while working up a good sweat on a bike. He was taken with the "Dessert of the 
Decade" story, which was accompanied by a full-page color picture of a 
sinful-looking cake and a recipe that went on for pages. Well, we guess 
everyone has his own inspiration. . . .

COLORS OF THE WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Colman Andrews 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Colorful. Now there's an overworked adjective, especially in the 
travel-writing game. The festival is colorful, the old quarter is colorful, the 
populace itself is colorful, the surrounding hills and meadows are just one big 
blaze of color. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Still, sometimes it's hard to know what else to say.Some places are just more 
brilliantly or more beautifully painted than others -- and the paint often 
proves unexpectedly indelible. Long after dimmer memories have stopped echoing 
through our synapses, we're likely to recall the hue and dye of here or there. 
Color, simply put, is more immediately sensual than shape. It burns straight 
into the brain, not bothering with the mental algebra and geometry we need to 
make sense of, say, the form of things. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailing past a forest on a Russian riverbank, our mind records the deep green 
and golden chiaroscuro of the sun-dappled trees, not the height of the trunks 
or the vein patterns on the leaves. Back from a voluptuous tropical Mexican 
seaport, we may not recall the stylistic period or the architect's name, but we 
can still feel the radiating colors of the buildings -- cobalt blue, hot pink, 
lurid purple, a green that could have been invented by Matisse. Even a city 
best known for sound and flavor imprints a gaudy souvenir of motley visual 
images (costumes, foodstuffs, faces) on the traveler's mind. Color isn't just 
immediate, it's fast. Colman Andrews

LOOKING AT ANOTHER SIDE TO 'COSMIC PRIZE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Eyes on the Cosmic Prize" by Irene Lacher (Feb. 20): 
</P>
<P>
 In asserting that "big government cheats people out of the spiritual rewards 
of giving to the needy," Arianna Huffington resurrects that morally repellent 
anachronism noblesse oblige.  
</P>
<P>
 The wealthy assuage their consciences not by striving for political reforms to 
redistribute wealth more equitably, but by doling out sporadic handouts to a 
perpetual underclass. Nothing ultimately changes. The poor are still poor. The 
only reward granted here is to Mrs. Huffington's ego. 
</P>
<P>
 MICHELLE PERSELL Santa Barbara * 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about arrogance. Arianna Huffington's plaintive argument that "big 
government cheats people out of the spiritual rewards of giving to the needy" 
makes my heart bleed. The assumption is that there must be needy in order that 
the rich can deal with their guilt feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we have the candidate, Michael Huffington, who attributes his financial 
success to "hard work and luck." It was luck all right to be born to a father 
who had a big Texas oil company Michael could sell. 
</P>
<P>
 BRYAN W. STEVENS Rolling Hills Estates * 
</P>
<P>
 What a shame the largess of the government has robbed Arianna Huffington of 
the privilege of charity. 
</P>
<P>
 But -- and this may come as a shock to her -- despite billions upon billions 
of tax dollars being tossed upon the poor and the downtrodden, there are plenty 
of arenas in which she could still flaunt her generosity.  
</P>
<P>
 Just in my neighborhood we have winos, crack-heads, epileptics, the homeless, 
schizophrenics and plain old middle-class types hanging on by the skin of their 
teeth while Huffington pontificates from her $4-million Italian villa up 
Montecito way. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Antoinette would be proud, not only of her ignorance but of the sheer 
scope and audacity of that ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
 ROB SULLIVAN Los Angeles * 
</P>
<P>
 Arianna Stassinopolous Huffington opines that in the absence of government 
action, the rich will voluntarily take care of those in need. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, her idea has already been tried. It was called the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 JEFFREY SCOTT BOOK Beverly Hills * 
</P>
<P>
 I have been working as a volunteer for a government agency for about two 
years. I visit shut-ins, chauffeur the elderly around, read to the blind, 
console the depressed. The social worker in charge of the department is a giant 
of a woman deluged under a heavy load of more than 200 clients. 
</P>
<P>
 She tells me other volunteers have not lasted more than a week or two and I 
sometimes wonder why I am still around. To take care of the poor is plain hard 
work. You are alone with no interaction with peers. 
</P>

 I have not encountered many of Arianna Huffington's spiritual souls to replace 
the faithful city and county workers we have in place. It is the government 
money and infrastructure that provide the help that enables elderly and 
physically handicapped welfare recipients to survive and keep some of their 
independence and dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 BRIGITTE SELIGMAN Santa Barbara * 
</P>
<P>
 Where were conservatives like the Huffingtons and their anti-big-government 
philosophy 25 years ago when big government was forcing my generation to serve 
in an unjust war? It's the same stale old wine in a fancy new bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 PAUL STEVENSON Playa Del Rey * 
</P>
<P>
 On the Nature of Inner Political Awareness, for Arianna Huffington:  
</P>
<P>
 It's incumbent on each of us, man, woman, child,  
</P>
<P>
 To belong to the Critical Mass.  
</P>
<P>
 To the left there is action, pragmatic and wild,  
</P>
<P>
 To the right lie the morally crass. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Political soundness, as Reagan has shown,  
</P>
<P>
 And Perot has learned to his cost , 
</P>
<P>
 Embraces the thought that we march not alone,  
</P>
<P>
 But, if touched by precision, are lost.  
</P>
<P>
 So soar from the House, Santa Barbara lass,  
</P>
<P>
 To the Senate, bless them with your touch.  
</P>
<P>
 And feed as you go the Uncritical Mass  
</P>
<P>
 With the Concept -- don't give them too much. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 MICHAEL JAGO Pacific Palisades * 
</P>
<P>
 As I was reading "Eyes on a Cosmic Prize," a political advertisement aired for 
Michael Huffington. He declared that as a child his family was not rich, but 
middle class. The Huntington family coffers have been estimated at $350 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 We are college-educated, working parents who are now seeing to it that our two 
children receive their college educations. We thought we were middle class. I 
guess not. 
</P>
<P>
 MARY L. DICKINSON Alta Loma * 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Huffington, Arianna Huffington's husband, spent $3 million to buy a 
congressman's seat. How much for Dianne Feinstein's seat, which he seeks, $7 to 
$10 million? And then the presidency. That could be quite costly. Probably in 
the $20 million to $30 million range.  
</P>
<P>
 But then Arianna can help with her fuzzy spiritualism. That should get some 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
 And though living in a $4-million home, she shows deep concern for the poor. 
That should get additional votes. 
</P>
<P>
 But it should be pointed out that though she shows concern for the poor, she 
doesn't work to change the conditions that create the poverty. No. That would 
be considered socialism. And that we cannot have.

HOUSEMATE TREND GROWING; LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP INTO SHARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER BENNETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are several potential barriers to overcome before opening up your home 
to a home-seeker. Not only must you clear the psychological hurdle of inviting 
a stranger to live in your home, you must jump through some legal, financial 
and insurance hoops before starting your home-sharing arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoning -- No permit or zoning change is required to rent rooms in one's home, 
says Darryl Fisher, Los Angeles city zoning administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners in other municipalities, however, should check with their zoning 
boards. Some cities may only seek to confirm that you're not converting your 
home into a boardinghouse, where a tenant receives a room, meals and services, 
and is excluded from sharing certain areas of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Covenants -- A covenant is an agreement written into the deed of each home 
site for an entire neighborhood that either restricts or prohibits certain 
housing practices. Homeowners should check these legal restrictions in their 
deed or with their local zoning board. Many covenants have long since been 
violated and forgotten, but that does not alter the fact that they remain 
legally enforceable, which could provide your housemate with the legal 
ammunition to sue should your relationship sour. 
</P>
<P>
 Reduction of loss of government benefits -- The net income you receive from 
home sharing must be reported to the Internal Revenue Service on Schedule E, 
the Supplemental Income Schedule. Increased income from home sharing may reduce 
or even cut benefits, including Supplemental Security Income (SSI), food stamps 
and Medicaid. If you rent your home and receive rental assistance from the 
government, your assistance may also be adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before you decide to open your home, be sure it won't cost you money," 
advises Leo Baldwin, author of "Homesharing and Other Lifestyle Options." 
</P>
<P>
 Increased Taxes -- Increased income can affect your eligibility for certain 
real estate rebates, tax deferrals or tax credits. If you are making physical 
improvements to your property, such as adding a private bathroom, your home 
will have to be reappraised for tax-assessment purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 $125,000 Exemption -- If you're over 55 and have lived in your home three of 
the last five years, you may benefit from the one-time $125,000 capital gains 
exemption when you go to sell your home. This tax advantage may be jeopardized, 
however, by renting a portion of your residence. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin provided the following example: If your home has a total of 1,800 
square feet of space and you rent out one-third, or 600 feet, he said, it would 
appear that the IRS would require you to prorate your capital gains. For 
example, if you purchased your house for $30,000 and sold it for $90,000, you 
would pay no capital gains, because your profit did not exceed $125,000. 
Baldwin notes, however, that it is likely the IRS would require that since 
one-third of the property was income-producing, one-third of the $60,000, or 
$20,000 would be taxed as a capital gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners should discuss all potential tax liabilities with their attorney or 
tax adviser before going ahead with home sharing, Baldwin advised. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance -- Your homeowner's insurance coverage, which protects your dwelling 
and personal property, should not be affected when you share your home. Your 
policy, however, will not cover the personal belongings of your sharer. Your 
sharer, therefore, should buy renter's insurance, which is usually available 
for a nominal fee when compared with the cost of replacing such items as 
computers, stereos and televisions. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens if your ceiling fan shakes loose and bonks your housemate on the 
head? Will your liability insurance be adequate to cover any claims? Discuss 
your coverage for personal injury or property damage with your insurance agent. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Housemates: A Practical Guide to Living with Others," author Deanna Sclar 
says: "No matter how many precautions you take, if you are going to rent out 
part of your home to strangers, you should make sure you have the best 
insurance coverage available." 
</P>
<P>
 Sclar also recommends removing any conditions that may be hazardous to 
children. Gate staircases, fence pool areas and cover hot tubs, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Sclar, "Frankly, if hazardous conditions exist on your property, it might 
be wiser not to rent to families with small children at all. Even if the 
parents agree beforehand to take full responsibility, it may make little or no 
difference in a court of law, should tragedy occur."

HOT PROPERTY: HE LEAVES 'BOYZ' FOR NEW 'HOOD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CUBA GOODING JR., who made his film debut in the lead role of the 1991 movie 
"Boyz N the Hood" and plays actor Paul Hogan's sidekick in the film "Lightning 
Jack," which opens Friday, has purchased a Studio City-area home. 
</P>
<P>
 Gooding, a first-time home buyer, had been sharing a Los Angeles house with 
four bachelor pals. The 25-year-old actor is expected to wed longtime 
girlfriend Sara Kapfer soon after the movie with Hogan opens. 
</P>
<P>
 The film is a comedy Western about an outlaw, played by Hogan, who takes a 
mute store clerk, played by Gooding, as hostage. The outlaw and the hostage 
become buddies. 
</P>
<P>
 Gooding, whose father was the lead vocalist for the R&B group the Main 
Ingredient, also co-starred with Emilio Estevez in "Judgment Night" (1993) and 
was a courtroom witness in Rob Reiner's "A Few Good Men." Gooding has won two 
NAACP Image Award nominations. 
</P>
<P>
 He bought a four-bedroom, 2,800-square-foot house, built in 1955. The 
ranch-style home is on almost an acre with mountain, canyon and city views. 
"There's lots of room for him, his soon-to-be wife and their collection of 
large dogs," a source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gooding paid $610,000 for the home, which had been listed at $850,000 with 
Michael and Linda Lesser of Prudential California Realty, Woodland Hills. Rory 
and Marc Shevin, of the firm's same office, represented Gooding. 
</P>
<P>
 Director ROB REINER bought a Malibu getaway after the fires and just before 
the mudslides that ravaged the area. Neither fire nor flood nor earthquake 
caused much if any damage to the house, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,700-square-foot house in Malibu Colony has 30 feet of beachfront. Reiner 
paid $3.75 million for the home, which had been on the market at $4.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiner's main residence is in Brentwood. He bought that house -- a 
10,000-square-footer -- from Norman Lear in 1991 for slightly more than $4.7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Legendary filmmaker KING VIDOR's knoll-top Beverly Hills home has come on the 
market for the first time in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8,000-square-foot house, designed by the late architect Wallace Neff and 
built for Vidor in 1928, is on five acres with city-to-ocean views, a tennis 
court and 1,500-foot-long, two-lane driveway. The asking price is $8.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Vidor, who directed many films from the 1920s' silents "The Crowd" and "The 
Big Parade" to "Duel in the Sun" (1946) and "Solomon and Sheba" (1959), and 
Neff, one of the architects to the stars of Hollywood's Golden Days, both died 
in 1982. Vidor was living in Paso Robles at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 A Japanese financier who lives primarily in France owns the house. "He's 
rarely here," said Drew Mandile, who shares the listing with Victoria Lockwood, 
both of Fred Sands' Directors office. 
</P>
<P>
 STEVE TISCH, who will produce the Nancy Kerrigan movie for ABC and is chairman 
of AIDS Project Los Angeles, has listed a three-acre-plus lot in Bel-Air at 
$1.45 million, with a rendering available of a 12,000-square-foot home. 
</P>
<P>
 Tisch had planned to build on the lot but wound up getting his family house 
back after he was divorced, sources say. Stephen Shapiro of Stan Herman/Stephen 
Shapiro & Associates has the listing. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Bros. Records executive JOHN BEUG has sold his three-bedroom home in 
the Hollywood Hills for close to its $575,000 asking price, and he has 
purchased a Santa Monica home for $1.3 million, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Beug lived in the Hollywood Hills home for 20 years, remodeling it in the 
mid-1980s. The contemporary-style house was built by a student of Richard 
Neutra and was remodeled by Peter deBretteville, who is now teaching 
architecture at Yale University. 
</P>
<P>
 Beug, who took great pride in the orchids he grew at his Hollywood Hills home, 
decided to buy in Santa Monica because he needed more room. After the move, he 
was married in his new home to a woman with three children. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Neil of Prudential California Realty, Hollywood Hills, represented Beug 
in the Santa Monica purchase and Hollywood sale, and Larry Eddo, of the same 
office, represented the buyer of the Hollywood house. The buyer was described 
as a writer of home furnishings books. 
</P>
<P>
 Architect LLOYD WRIGHT's studio, designated a West Hollywood "cultural 
resource," has come on the market at $665,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Built by the late architect in 1928, the house, which has a stuccoed frame 
with elaborate precast concrete block decorations within and without, has a 
ground-floor office and a two-bedroom apartment, all in 2,300 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The current owners bought the studio from the Wright family a few years ago. 
Although overshadowed by his famous father Frank Lloyd Wright, Lloyd Wright, 
who died in 1978, designed a number of innovative houses in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Klug of Douglas Properties Estates, Beverly Hills, has the listing.

RENT WATCH: WHO GETS TO KEEP FRUIT FROM BACK YARD TREES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to the Times; This column is prepared by Project Sentinel, a rental 
housing mediation service in Sunnyvale, Calif. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: About eight months ago, we assumed tenancy of a house. This summer 
our landlord instructed us not to pick the fruit, that it belongs to his family 
and that they would be over to harvest it when it was ripe. We are responsible 
for maintaining and watering the yard, are we not entitled to the fruit on the 
trees? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Residential rentals usually provide for exclusive use of the property 
by the tenants. For your landlord to cultivate the fruit on the trees, he must 
have reserved this right in a written rental agreement. Because you assumed 
possession of the property from the former tenants, you are bound by the terms 
of the original rental agreement. Check this agreement to see if it includes 
anything regarding the landlord's reserved right to remove the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is nothing in the rental agreement on this topic, then you should be 
able to restrict the landlord's entry and have the right to reap the fruits of 
your labor. However, the most prudent action for all parties concerned might be 
to negotiate and to find some way to share the fruit. Must Landlord Replace 
Smoke Alarm Battery? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My tenant called to notify me that the battery in his smoke detector was 
dead and to request that I provide him with a new one. Is it my responsibility 
to replace batteries? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Generally, it is up to the tenant to replace items such as batteries and 
light bulbs when they wear out during the tenancy. However, considering the 
importance of a functioning smoke detector, you may want to give him a battery, 
as the benefit far outweighs the cost, and under the circumstances, your tenant 
may decide not to replace it just to spite you. You might consider changing to 
non-battery operated detectors, so you won't need to depend on your tenants to 
keep the detectors in operable condition. 
</P>
<P>
 You may want to check with city or county offices to determine if there are 
local ordinances that make landlords or property owners responsible for 
maintaining smoke detectors. 'Steering' Is a Form of Racial Discrimination 
</P>
<P>
 Q: For the last 10 years I have enjoyed having neighbors and friends from 
different races and backgrounds in the large complex where I live. However, 
since the new manager took over a year ago, it seems to me that most people of 
color end up living in the back of the complex near the freeway, while my 
section is becoming increasingly white. I noticed a reference to child 
"steering" in a recent column. Could this be a variation of the same practice? 
When I asked the manager about it, she said that people often prefer to be with 
their own kind, but I disagree. Can anything be done here? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, something can be done. Steering as a means of racial and national 
origin discrimination also occurs, and may explain the changes that you have 
observed in your complex. As it does in child discrimination, this practice has 
the effect of limiting the amount of housing stock available to the people who 
are being segregated, however subtly, into one part of the complex. It may also 
result in less-desirable housing being made available, often near a busy street 
or in a less visible or less well-maintained part of the complex. In any case, 
it represents less than equal opportunity housing. If you feel that this may be 
happening in your complex, it's time to contact your local Fair Housing agency. 
What to Do If Security Deposit Isn't Returned 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Although I moved out of my former apartment more than two weeks ago, I have 
not yet received a refund of my security deposit from my ex-landlord. I know 
that she is legally bound to return my deposit with two weeks, or to provide me 
with an explanation of any deductions. What should I do now? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Unless your lease or rental agreement specifically mentions a two-week 
deposit return period, you should wait another week because of recent changes 
in the law. In the past, many landlords complained that the two-week period 
allowed by state law was not sufficient because they needed more time to clean 
and to complete repair work before they could fully assess damages on a vacated 
unit. Also, many tenants complained that the $200 maximum that judges could 
award as penalty when landlords acted in bad faith, was too little to 
discourage landlords from retaining security deposits without cause. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to respond to these complaints, California Civil Code Section 
1950.5 was amended to modify both of these items effective as of Jan. 1, 1994. 
Your landlord now has three weeks to return your security deposit, or to send 
you a written explanation of any deductions, and a judge can now award up to 
$600 in punitive damages if you can prove that your landlord acted in bad 
faith. 
</P>
<P>
 If you still do not receive your refund and an explanation of any deductions 
within the next week, you have several options. Write, call or tell the 
landlord in person that you want your refund and that you are aware of your 
rights under state law. If the landlord does not give you the refund with a 
written explanation of any deduction, you can contact your local 
tenant/landlord program for assistance. If both you and the landlord wish, the 
program can set up a mediation to resolve any disagreements you may have about 
the refund. Should these approaches fail, you may have to file in Small Claims 
Court against your former landlord to attempt to receive any refunded to which 
you feel you are entitled. 
</P>
<P>
 Both tenants and landlords in existing rental agreements should be aware that 
a long-term lease specifying a two-week period remains in force until the end 
of the lease, and in such a case, the deposit must still be returned within two 
weeks of the end of the tenancy. Terms in existing month-to-month agreements 
now specifying a two-week period may be changed to three weeks with a 30-day 
written notice from landlord to tenant.

YOUR MORTGAGE; TIPS ON WHAT'S NEW IN RATE LOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. HARNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Any prospective home buyer or seller who's heard about Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan's late February congressional testimony should carry 
two words into this spring's market: rate lock.  
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan didn't use the words himself. But the upshot of his testimony was 
that interest rates are probably more likely to go up, not down, as the 1994 
economic recovery gains steam. So don't assume the three-quarters of a percent 
jump in mortgage rates since mid-January is the end of the upturn. To the 
contrary. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why you need to get up to speed on the latest options available in rate 
locks. For example, you can now get mortgage rate locks that are attached to 
houses for sale, and that shield potential purchasers from rate increases for 
up to three months. You can also sign up for rate locks that travel with you as 
a home shopper, giving you rate protection before you've even figured out what 
property you want to buy or applied for a loan. When you finally do locate a 
house, you've got a loan rate guarantee in your pocket -- a 7 1/2% mortgage, 
for example, in an 8% market. 
</P>
<P>
 To get a feel for what's new in 1994 rate locks, here's a quick guide. Start 
with the traditional rate lock concept. When you've found the house you want to 
buy, you contact a lender and apply for a mortgage. The rate and points on the 
loan during the weeks or months prior to closing can either float with the 
market or can be locked in -- guaranteed -- for a set period of time. (A point 
is equal to 1% of the loan amount.) Generally the longer the rate-lock period, 
the higher the points charged at a given rate. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, to lock in a mortgage at 7 1/8% for 60 days might cost one-half 
a point more than a 15- or 20-day lock at the same rate. The extra half-point 
is attributable to the greater risk to the lender that rates will rise sometime 
during the coverage period. 
</P>
<P>
 During much of 1993, when mortgage rates trended downward, borrowers 
frequently opted to float during loan processing, locking in just days before 
the scheduled closing. That made sense last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But floating your quote this year not only exposes you to greater danger of a 
sudden interest rate spike. It's completely unnecessary to boot, thanks to 
recent innovations in rate-lock programs. For instance, there's no need to 
delay a rate lock for the weeks it takes you to locate and sign a sales 
contract on the house you want to buy. Major national lenders will lock you 
into current rates while you shop. Or while you negotiate with the seller.

 Countrywide Funding Corp., a Pasadena-based mortgage banker active in all 50 
states, offers what it calls a "Lock 'n Shop" program for no additional points 
or fees. Home buyers who are seriously in the market can apply for 
pre-qualification -- that is, obtain approval in advance for a maximum mortgage 
amount at current rates. 
</P>
<P>
 With locked-in financing in hand, they can then shop or negotiate on 
properties for 30 days. If they've found the house they want during that 
period, they can then extend the rate-lock for another 60 days on FHA-VA loans 
or 45 days for conventional mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 American Residential Mortgage Corp. of La Jolla, another large lender active 
nationwide, offers a 75-day "Lock-Shopper" program at no charge. At any time 
during the 75-day lock period, the prospective buyer can convert to a 60-day 
"lockbreaker." That locks in the then-current rate, and allows the buyer to 
float downward -- if rates decline prior to closing -- but never to go higher 
than the locked commitment rate. Cost of the lockbreaker is one-quarter of a 
point, but that amount is credited back to the borrower at the time of 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Most intriguing of all 1994-model rate locks are those designed to cover -- 
and help sell -- specific houses. They provide written, contractual rate 
protection for any qualified buyer of the locked-in home. For example, say you 
want to sell your house this spring. You're worried about rising rates, and you 
want a leg up in marketing your property. Through your listing real estate 
agent, you may be able to get -- and advertise -- "rate protection" for 
potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The participating lender essentially guarantees that any qualified buyer of 
the house will be charged no higher than the locked rate and point quote. 
Countrywide's version of the program uses the same 30-, 45- and 60-day rules as 
its "Lock 'n Shop." American Residential's version -- currently available in a 
handful of areas but scheduled for nationwide introduction this spring -- 
offers 90-day buyer rate coverage, at no charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line on rate locks this spring: Check them out. Ask mortgage 
brokers, mortgage bankers, and real estate agents about what options they can 
offer. If you can avoid the risk of being hit by higher rates, why not?

CAN NEW PERSHING SQUARE PREVAIL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his article on Pershing Square ("Bold New Look, Same Old Hope," (Feb. 13), 
Leon Whiteson asks, "Can an act of architecture change a city's ingrained 
social habits?" 
</P>
<P>
 This new-era urban-designed square will certainly change our ingrained social 
habits.You see, no public restrooms are provided. Whiteson's article mentions 
that the architect's post-modern "Latinismo" style seems "tense." Perhaps this 
is what he meant.

 In his review, Whiteson should not have been so quick to blame the possible 
failure of the new park on the Anglo business community's (presumed) reluctance 
to mingle with the Latino population. 
</P>
<P>
 A more likely cause would be the forbidding ugliness of the new space. Even 
Whiteson admits that the "hardscaped," shadeless park looks "desolate." To 
blame the park's possible failure on supposed white separatism seems plainly 
absurd in this instance.

 I went to Pershing Square last Sunday morning at 11 o'clock, parked my car 
downstairs and took the escalator up to experience "a common ground where 
citizens of all classes and ethnicity can mingle freely." I wasn't there two 
minutes before someone offered to sell me some drugs, and I didn't see any 
police or park rangers around until 2 p.m. A park cannot be judged by how much 
money was spent to revive it, it is judged by the humanity of the people who go 
there.

FASTER APPRAISALS COSTLY IN LONG RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re the article "Proposed Appraisal Cost Slash Has Flaw:" (Jan. 9) Another 
bright idea from the folks that brought us the savings & loan crisis -- or at 
least watched it happen. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the FDIC, OTC and others think they have credibility when it comes 
to banking operations? A proposal to cut the cost of an appraisal to "speed up 
the loan process" is an illustration of the inherent ineptness of these 
industry spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 I say that using a staff evaluator instead of certified appraiser to estimate 
the value of a given property will be more costly than beneficial. A lender 
simply can't staff up with a few evaluators and assume they will perform the 
functions of an appraiser. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is that these evaluators will have to jump in their cars and 
drive to properties. They will have to stand in line at the county planning 
offices. They will have to call realtors to get information about comparable 
sales. Not to mention the phone calls from every person involved with the loan. 
Meanwhile the 10 or 12 loan packages that need to get out today wait on top of 
their desk. Speeding up the loan process? 
</P>
<P>
 All of this just to save the borrower less than 1% of the typical loan cost? 
What's next on the regulator's chopping block -- title search? credit report? 
Leave cost-cutting decisions to those that do it best -- private industry. The 
free market will decide the cost of an appraisal.

CAREFULLY COMPARE ARM FINANCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the article by Robert J. Bruss "Making 'Best' Choice When Refinancing," 
(Dec. 26) he makes many good points. However, the relatively short description 
on adjustable rates mortgages may lull the reader into a false sense of 
security in believing he is now "ARMed" with sufficient knowledge. Three 
warnings seem appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruss indicates that the best way to choose loans is to "shop," comparing 
annual percentage rate (APR). Deceptive APR advertisements of ARM loans, 
although unlawful, are unwittingly carried by nearly every newspaper. Thus, APR 
shoppers should compare any too-good-to-be-true quote (today, anything less 
than 5.5%) to those of at least five major financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, even legitimate APR calculations still assume today's 
historically low variable interest rates will remain unchanged for 30 years. 
Thus, shoppers who anticipate owning the loan for more than four years should 
also obtain and compare a second "downside scenario APR." This computation 
should reflect a 2% annual increase in the underlying index, thus incorporating 
the effects of lifetime interest rate caps (which can range from 9% to 14%), 
periodic rate caps, as well as full negative amortization, if applicable. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruss also notes that he favors the 11th District cost-of-funds index for 
ARMs. However, comparison using either of these two APR computation scenarios 
will quickly reveal that most such 11th District COF loans are worse than say, 
a six-month CD or one-year Treasury indexed loan.

</P>
<P>
 The annual percentage rate (APR) can be a valuable tool to help you shop for a 
mortgage, but only when you know how to use it. An APR measures the total cost 
of the loan (including interest, points and fees) and compares this cost to the 
amount you borrowed. You could call an APR the "effective" interest rate 
because points and fees are also included. 
</P>
<P>
 The tricky part of using APRs is knowing when you're comparing "apples vs. 
apples." To start with, you'll need to make sure that all APRs are calculated 
using the same loan amount. Without doing this, it's impossible to make any 
meaningful comparison between two or more APRs. Therefore, beware of APRs in 
advertisements that do not divulge the loan amount. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of strategy, there are two steps in the use of APRs that will give 
you good results. First, you should begin shopping for a mortgage by using a 
list of lenders rates where the APRs have been calculated using the same loan 
amount, such as that shown in the Mortgage Rate Report in The Times Real Estate 
section. Use this list to narrow down your search to a group of four or five 
lenders that have the best rates. Second, call each lender and have them 
calculate an APR for your loan amount and all applicable fees for your loan 
offer. This approach will give you comparable APRs and a good bottom-line 
measure of which loan offer is the better one.

CAN NEW PERSHING SQUARE PREVAIL?; DESTROYED CONDOS MAY NOT BE REPAIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This letter concerns condominiums that were destroyed or substantially damaged 
by the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Your readers who own condos need to know that California law does not require 
that destroyed units be repaired. Section 1364 (a) of the California Civil Code 
states that the owners' association is responsible for repairing, replacing or 
maintaining the common areas, unless otherwise provided in the declaration of 
the development. It is not unusual for such declarations to allow the owners to 
decide whether destroyed units will be repaired. Concerned readers should 
carefully review their declarations to determine their rights and the time 
period in which their rights may be exercised.

DEMOCRATIZATION OF MULTIPLE LISTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Hands-On House Hunting" (Jan. 23) pointed out some features of computerized 
MLS listings. What would be intriguing, however, would be to incorporate that 
service into a bigger computer network -- Internet.Rather than driving to my 
realtor's office, why can't I look properties over on my computer at home, at a 
time convenient to me? Why can't we democratize the MLS guide so we don't have 
to rely on what realtors think is best for us? 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the criteria used in selecting a home through a new computer service 
could be expanded to included such issues as: 
</P>
<P>
 Has the house been bolted to its foundation, and have the proper permits been 
pulled? In other words, were the sellers wise enough to spend money where it 
counts, on the structure, rather than on cozy vanilla smells and gallons of 
paint? 
</P>
<P>
 What are the walls and roof made of? 
</P>
<P>
 Is the attic insulated? (lower energy bills) 
</P>
<P>
 Is wiring, plumbing, heating up to code? 
</P>
<P>
 Are any recent additions or remodels properly inspected and permitted, so new 
owners won't have a problem in selling the property in the future? 
</P>
<P>
 How could zoning affect any future plans to the property? 
</P>
<P>
 Opening up choice to the time-strapped consumer is the future. So is building 
homes more attuned to structural robustness rather than curb appeal, which has 
no value in an earthquake.

HOW TO SOLVE DISPUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Peter Bennett 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Home sharing is a business relationship with an unusually strong emotional 
component. To get along with your new partner, you'll have to learn how to 
share your disagreements agreeably.For example, when reacting to a stack full 
of dirty dishes that your housemate "forgot" to clean and put away, try to 
remain calm and diplomatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Most shared housing experts believe housemates should have a monthly "family 
meeting" to discuss their current living situation and update their agreement. 
When conflicts or disagreements arise, the National Shared Housing Resource 
Center suggests the following "Ten Commandments" for solving disputes: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Clearly state the problem as you see it, how you feel and what you'd like 
to have done to change the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- Discuss one issue at a time without being defensive. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- Make sure you agree on what the problem is. 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- Listen carefully to what the other person is saying, thinking and feeling 
about the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 5 -- List different solutions and steps for resolving the problem. Don't 
disregard or reject any ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 6 -- Discuss possible solutions, listing the good points about each and the 
drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 7 -- Choose a plan you are both comfortable with. 
</P>
<P>
 8 -- Decide how you will implement the plan. What are the steps? Who will do 
what, and when? 
</P>
<P>
 9 -- Decide on a time to discuss progress or other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 10 -- Take pride in working out the problem.Peter Bennett

WRITING A HOUSEMATE AD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Peter Bennett 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Placing an ad in the classified section of the newspaper can be one of your 
best tools for finding a compatible housemate. Be brief and to the point when 
composing your ad.To help you master this technique, look at other examples in 
the paper and stick to the five Ws of journalism: who, what, where, when and 
why.  
</P>
<P>
 Try writing your own ad by briefly answering each of the following questions: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Who am I? 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- What am I looking for? 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- Where would I like to live? 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- When do I want to make the change? 
</P>
<P>
 5 -- Why am I looking? 
</P>
<P>
 Two examples follow: 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Raiders fan seeks silver-and-black loyalist to share season and 
2BR apartment near coliseum. $300. Imm. available. Bert 213-RAIDERS. 
</P>
<P>
 Grad student seeks quiet, private room near university to complete doctoral 
thesis. Will exchange light house repairs for reduction in rent. Reply to box 
XYZ. 
</P>
<P>
 When Deanna Sclar, author of "Housemates: A Practical Guide to Living With 
Other People," advertises for people to share her Santa Barbara home, the first 
word she uses in her ad is quiet. In other words, she wants to screen out 
"Monday Night Football" fanatics from taking over her living room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to tell people right off that I'm looking for someone who will view my 
home as a retreat, or as a quiet place to unwind after work," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing she and other advertisers for housemates don't want to tell is their 
home phone number or address. They recommend using a voice mail or answering 
service to screen messages.Peter Bennett

 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * CAR-TRACKING CONTRACT: Approved continuing a contract with the LoJack Corp. 
that implemented a Stolen Vehicle Recovery Network Program in 1989. The 
program, which enables law enforcement to electronically track vehicles, has 
proved to be the most successful way to quickly recover a stolen car, city 
officials say. The contract continuation will be on a month-to-month basis 
until a lengthier contract is awarded, possibly to another company with similar 
technology. The cost of installing a LoJack tracking device in a private car is 
$600. 
</P>
<P>
 * QUAKE AID: Approved a motion to use $560,000 in Community Block Grant funds 
to support 30 agencies that are providing services in areas damaged by the 
earthquake. Among the agencies that will receive between $11,000 and $22,000 
each are the Chicana Service Action Center, Parents of Watts, Lutheran Social 
Services, Los Angeles Free Clinic and the Armenian Relief Society. 
</P>
<P>
 * DEADLINE FOR BUSINESS TAX: Approved extending the deadline for businesses to 
pay their business tax from Feb. 28 to May 31, providing the business can show 
significant disruption resulting from the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * STREET CLOSURES: Because of the Academy Awards presentation at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion on March 21, the following streets will be closed to traffic 
on that day from 2:20 to 8 p.m.: the eastbound lanes of Temple Street, from 
Beaudry Avenue to Hill Street; the eastbound lanes of 1st Street, from Beaudry 
to Olive Street; the northbound lanes of Flower Street, from 1st to 3rd Street; 
the northbound lanes of Hope Street, from General Kosciuszko Way to 1st Street; 
and the westerly three lanes of Hill Street from Temple to 1st. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues. * DEMOLITION PROGRAM: Approved the implementation of the Board of 
Public Works' Earthquake Demolition and Debris Removal Program that would favor 
hiring local businesses to demolish buildings damaged by the Northridge 
earthquake and clean up debris. About 500 firms, more than half of which are 
based in Los Angeles County, are expected to bid on contracts to demolish up to 
1,000 buildings. In opposing the program, Councilman Mike Hernandez argued that 
it should be designed to award all contracts to local firms. Passed 12-3. 
Voting yes: Jackie Goldberg, Nate Holden, Mark Ridley-Thomas, Rita Walters, 
Rudy Svorinich Jr. Voting no: Richard Alatorre, Hernandez. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

DEFRAUDED COUPLE SUE, GET HOME BACK; CRIME: COURTROOM VICTORIES ARE RARE, 
HOWEVER, OVER A REAL ESTATE TITLE SCAM THAT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY COMMON. 
</P>

<P>
 In a common case of real estate fraud that plagues South Los Angeles 
homeowners, Henry and Caroline Jackson lost their home of 14 years to a scam 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
 What is uncommon is that they got it back. 
</P>
<P>
 Most cases of real estate fraud in which homeowners try to get their property 
returned are settled out of court or lost to complex paper trails, according to 
public-interest attorneys. In addition, even in cases in which fraud is proved, 
attorneys are not always able to get the homeowner's title or property back 
because the owners have already been evicted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Jacksons' case was unusual not only because it went to trial and the 
couple succeeded in getting the title of their house returned, but because they 
also were awarded nearly $100,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is incredible, it's a real success story," said Ron Kaye, an attorney 
with the Legal Aid Foundation who represented the Jacksons in their lawsuit. 
"We're usually hard-pressed to fight cases like this and come out of it with 
something to show for it." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal in many real estate rip-offs is to get victims to sign deeds of trust 
over to the hustlers, who then use the property as collateral to take out loans 
for themselves, as happened to the Jacksons. However, the owners are still 
responsible for repaying those loans. 
</P>
<P>
 South Los Angeles is one of the prime targets for real estate hustlers because 
of the dearth of lending institutions in the area. Law enforcement officials 
and public-interest attorneys estimate that about 60% of the city's real estate 
fraud victims live in South-Central or East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most homeowners never get . . . a chance to get an attorney and the scammers 
know that, so those are the people they go after," said Ken Babcock, an 
attorney with Public Counsel, a public-interest law firm, which handles real 
estate fraud cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a tremendous amount of resources to fight these cases, and it's not 
uncommon for equity scammers and mortgage brokers to try and settle with those 
victims who find an attorney because they want to get rid of a thorn in their 
side." 
</P>
<P>
 In the two-year court battle to get their home back, the Jacksons ended up 
being a massive thorn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Jacksons' trouble started in 1989 when they met Ronald Jones, a private 
investor who told the couple he would help get them out of foreclosure after 
they were unable to repay about $7,000 on a second mortgage and nearly $33,000 
in balloon loan payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in the projects in Watts, Caroline Jackson dreamed of getting 
married, owning a house and raising her children there. In 1976, she and her 
husband, Henry, bought their three-bedroom house on the 10200 block of Harvard 
Street and spent the next several years making improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Each improvement carried another loan. Each loan had a balloon finance 
payment, which all came due around the same time in early 1989. The Jacksons 
had no way to pay the enormous bill, so their home was put in foreclosure by 
the banks and loan brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1989, Jones was introduced to the couple by a woman who claimed to 
specialize in helping homeowners get out of foreclosure. Jones promised to help 
the couple and said he would put up some money that would allow the couple to 
get out of debt, and then they could pay him back in installments, Caroline 
Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a civil court trial, Kaye pointed out that Jones told the Jacksons he would 
pay their debt. He assured the couple that they could stay in the house as long 
they paid him $900 a month in rent. They had paid $724 a month for their 
mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court documents, Jones had told the couple the only way he could 
help them was for them to sign over the title of the house to him immediately 
or risk losing the house in foreclosure. The couple said they did not know that 
signing over the deed to their house meant that they no longer owned it, so 
they followed Jones' suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every person in the United States dreams of having a home. And I didn't want 
to lose mine," said Caroline Jackson. "So we signed over the title. . . . We 
were stressed, so I cooperated, because this was my first time ever being up 
against the wall that hard." 
</P>
<P>
 For the next two years, the Jacksons regularly paid $900 a month in rent to 
live in their house, did their own repairs and continued believing they would 
eventually have their debt paid off and have their lives return to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Jones had taken out $80,000 in loans against the Jacksons' home, 
Kaye said. In early 1991, Jones asked the couple to try to refinance the 
property, which is when they discovered the house was no longer in their names. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had put everything in his name and we couldn't do anything. We couldn't 
get a loan, try and work off these debts, nothing," Henry Jackson said. "I felt 
like we had really been taken, and it didn't look like there was anything we 
could do. Every day felt like we were growing another year older with all the 
stress." 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1991, Jones threatened to evict the Jacksons, and sent another 
eviction notice to them in March, 1992. He had already made the couple show the 
house to prospective buyers and put a For Sale sign in the front of the 
manicured lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was humiliating for me. At that time I was begging with him not to put us 
out," Caroline Jackson said. "How could he do this to us, because we trusted 
him from 1989 until 1992? He asked me to cooperate with him, and I did." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple sought help from the Legal Aid Foundation in 1992, soon after the 
second eviction threat. A civil court jury found in favor of the Jacksons after 
a monthlong trial late last year, and the title to their home was placed back 
in their names in January. Jones has been ordered to pay the family nearly 
$100,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Jones nor his attorney would comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome of the civil suit, Kaye said, should caution real estate hustlers 
that "they can no longer try to rip people off like this and get away with it."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; VIDEOS PUT FOCUS ON AREA CRIME SPOTS 
</P>

<P>
 Keith Thomas started taking photographs when he was a teen-ager, but nearly 20 
years after shooting a friend's wedding, Thomas is using the latest in home 
video equipment to capture crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, a police officer at the 77th Street Division station, is part of a 
pilot program that relies on residents to identify crime problems and then 
decide which ones police should tackle first. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very powerful tool and we've seen remarkable success (with it)," said 
Gloria Howland, president of a local police advisory committee. She pointed to 
an increased sense of community, cleaning up of alleys where drug sales were 
once prominent, and merchants increasing lighting around their stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Keith's videotapes we can look at (the problems), and then we can 
prioritize. You stop looking at things individually, and begin looking at 
things as a group. You stop looking at things as a block but instead as a 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 The program, the only one of its kind in the South Bureau, began in November 
when Thomas was transferred from the vice squad to the community relations 
department. Thomas, a part-time photographer, said he came up with the idea of 
videotaping hot spots while trying to decide how to show residents what was 
going on in their neighborhoods and other neighborhoods near them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is now going into high-tech," said Thomas. "You see it with officers 
putting video cameras in their cars, so I thought: 'Why not use my little 
camcorder from home and I'll just buy the videotapes?' " 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting with about a dozen residents in the area bounded by 79th Street 
on the north, Vermont Avenue on the east, 108th Street on the south and Van 
Ness on the west, Thomas began compiling a list of problem areas. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the program's successes have come from the cooperation of residents 
who contact Thomas with neighborhood complaints. He then videotapes problem 
areas and shows the tapes during the advisory board's weekly meetings. 
Residents then decide which problem should be addressed first.  
</P>
<P>
 One day last week, Thomas drove by some of the neighborhoods he has worked 
with, including a row of one-story homes along 92nd Street. Steering the patrol 
car down a two-block stretch of clean alleys that he described as once filled 
with transients, drug dealers and trash, he looked for signs of drug sales. 
"There used to be constant foot traffic," he said. "You could drive through 
here 24 hours a day and buy dope." 
</P>
<P>
 Just blocks away at 84th Street, Thomas slowed down as he passed a suspected 
rock house. Calling it the current priority, Thomas has already compiled 
several minutes of footage there and contacted the FALCON unit, a multi-agency 
task force that works with landlords to evict drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Howard and other residents embrace the program as a success, police 
remain cautiously optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a new program, so the long-term affects are yet to be determined," said 
Capt. Larry Goebel, area commanding officer of the 77th Street Division 
station. "But it's successful in that we've gotten people to be responsible to 
specific concerns." SANDRA HERNANDEZ

<P>
 United Way of Greater Los Angeles has awarded grants totaling $141,000 to 
three local youth programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Council on Alcoholism & Drug Dependency, Los Angeles, which 
provides teen parenting classes, literacy classes and substance abuse 
counseling, received a $70,000 grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means we can get the services out there and start this collaborative 
effort," said Terry Hayes, executive director of the organization at 8915 
Avalon Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 The group will use the one-time grant to start a pilot program in conjunction 
with the Los Angeles Probation Department to reduce juvenile delinquency. 
</P>
<P>
 "This really does invest in South-Central. It will help provide a 
comprehensive approach to working with kids and their families," Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
 El Nido Family Center and Family Services of Los Angeles' Manchester Center 
also received funds. Both provide counseling services and offer drug-prevention 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was some additional monies that were available on a one-time basis," 
said Yezdyar Kaoosji, regional vice president of the Metropolitan Region, 
United Way. "The idea was to distribute the money as quickly as possible, so we 
went back to the agencies we know have worked very well and effectively."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: WATTS; SERVICE IS THEME OF SCHOLARSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A commitment to community service is the theme behind Drew Economic 
Development Corp.'s newly established scholarship for students at King/Drew 
Medical Magnet High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit development corporation is sponsoring three $500 scholarships to 
1994 graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 Recipients will be selected based on community service and academic 
performance by the school's faculty and reviewed by Beverly T. Davis, the 
founding chairwoman of the corporation's board of directors. The scholarship 
was named in honor of Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is like a shot in the arm because (the scholarship funds) show us 
that the hard work we're putting forth is . . . being noticed," said Shirley 
Starke, principal at the high school. 
</P>
<P>
 King/Drew Medical Magnet High, founded in 1982, has 220 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the school received a $5,000 contribution from the Educational 
Foundation for Black Americans in Long Beach.

 Residents and politicians joined together to praise the groundbreaking of a 
new commercial plaza at Vermont Avenue that will include a Smart & Final 
warehouse grocery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am thrilled that it's here," said Claudia Noonan, a resident and member of 
the 8th City Council District's community empowerment task force."There is a 
big need and demand for bulk discount grocery shopping and Smart & Final 
provides that with other benefits. It provides a safe and clean facility." 
</P>
<P>
 The store is expected to open in July at a cost of about $1 million, said 
Leanne Reynolds, spokeswoman for Smart & Final. About a dozen jobs will be 
created by the warehouse-style store. 
</P>
<P>
 The need for large grocery stores has long been expressed in this community. 
</P>
<P>
 "You won't be disappointed. We're ready to shop here," said Brian Eklund, 
pastor at St. Mark's Lutheran Church. "Smart & Final hires from the community 
and that's what we need."  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who represents the 8th District, heralded the 
arrival of the plaza, which will be built on the site of a liquor store 
destroyed during the 1992 riots. "It signals the continued investment of the 
institutional participants," said Ridley-Thomas at Monday's groundbreaking 
ceremony at 3607 Vermont Ave. "If we don't want the number of liquor stores to 
run down our neighborhoods, we've got to build stores." 
</P>
<P>
 This is Smart & Final's third store to be built in urban areas affected by the 
riots. The company has 45 stores in Los Angeles County. SANDRA HERNANDEZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; MARIACHIS TRUMPET THEIR CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sounds coming out of Room 105 at Belvedere Junior High School long after 
the day's last bell has rung make janitors stop their work and lingering 
students stare in its direction. 
</P>
<P>
 It is like this every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon when Mariachi Olimpico 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Trumpets make the short hops of a corrido and violins strain on the melody of 
a love song. The guitarrons keep time and strong voices sing the Spanish lyrics 
of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Every now and then, music teacher Adolfo Martinez's raised fist signals for 
the mariachis to stop and the offending musicians are given a gentle nudge to 
perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not together on this," he says before asking for a spot solo 
performance to work out the kinks. Sometimes the problem is no more serious 
than an instrument slightly out of tune, or a bow turned in the wrong 
direction. "You have more power this way, more control," Martinez says after 
showing some of the violinists the proper way to hold their bows. "Try that." 
</P>
<P>
 After playing a few notes that were problematic just minutes ago, the sound 
becomes clean. "Good, much better," says their teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 The 28 students who make up Mariachi Olimpico practice two afternoons a week 
for two hours, in addition to their daily one-hour music class. Since 1989, 
Martinez has coached novice musicians to an award-winning level of performance, 
bringing recognition to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariachi Olimpico, funded solely by private contributions, relies on an annual 
fund-raiser breakfast to provide the bulk of its funds, said coordinator 
Patricia Foster. The annual cost for instruments, travel and trajes, or 
costumes, is $35,000. Each elaborate sombrero is $300, Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth annual breakfast is from 9 a.m. to noon today at Almansor Court, 700 
S. Almansor St., Alhambra. A $30 entry fee includes breakfast and a 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also has produced a collection of songs on compact disc and 
cassette, "El Primer Paso," which includes performances by some of the original 
members of Mariachi Olimpico. "One of the reasons we wanted to record it was to 
have a record of each year," Foster said. "You can see how the kids progress 
each year." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who has been teaching at Belvedere for 17 years, originally taught 
classical music. One year, he taught his students one mariachi song and had 
them perform for a teachers' breakfast. "The response was so good," he said. 
"At the time I started, I didn't know what I was in for." 
</P>
<P>
 The music has become a link between the students and their history -- and 
their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the only thing that we have in common," said Rosa Castillo, whose 
14-year-old daughter, Maria del Carmen Hernandez, plays the guitar. Although 
Maria del Carmen is not among the 14 performing mariachis, she practices after 
school with the rest of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means a lot to me because I'm originally from Mexico and she was born 
here," Castillo said. "She's in-between and she's not sure what her origin is. 
Being in a mariachi is something totally different for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I saw her play, I got goose bumps all over my body. You start 
getting all these feelings inside. Mariachi is good music." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Martinez: "Culturally, I thought they needed to be exposed to their own 
music and, as a result, their self-esteem came up," Martinez said. Stage 
performances give them more confidence and the audience response adds to that, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was growing up, we were trying to be de-culturalized," Martinez said. 
"In the long run, your self-esteem suffers when you've got somebody telling you 
your language and culture are not the right thing or not good enough. This is 
really an experience for them."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: SOUTHEAST AREA; SCHOOL ACTIVISTS MAY PUSH FOR 
SECESSION 
</P>

 Education activists in the Southeast area, angered by a recommendation to 
create a "super cluster" of the three local high school complexes when the Los 
Angeles Unified School District reorganizes, say it may be time to secede from 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are those in the area that feel we should be our own school district," 
said Assemblywoman Martha M. Escutia (D-Huntington Park). 
</P>
<P>
 The Bell, Huntington Park and South Gate high school complexes, with a 
combined enrollment of about 55,000, would be the largest of 24 clusters under 
a plan recommended by a subcommittee of the Cluster Transition Task Force and 
sent last week to Superintendent Sid Thompson. The next-largest cluster, 
combining the Manual Arts and Jefferson high school complexes in Los Angeles, 
would have about 43,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 The community clusters, which would regroup the district's 650 campuses into 
high schools and their feeder campuses, are the first step of a plan to 
restructure the district and decentralize decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it is unclear how the district's resources will be distributed to the 
clusters, some fear that the Southeast area, where at least 94% of high school 
students are Latino and 55% speak limited English, could be shortchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 "We better get more money than any other cluster," Escutia said. "If we don't 
get the money to justify serving 55,000 students, the whole movement to secede 
is going to take on a life of its own." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we could handle it a lot better locally," said Willene Cooper, 
chairwoman of the Southeast Area Coalition on Overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce Peyton, director of the district office of school utilization, said that 
if resources are distributed on a per-pupil basis, the resources would be the 
same as they are now. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we really believe that the students are best served at their local 
school," she said, "does it really matter who the cluster leader is and how the 
clusters are grouped together?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Southeast cluster would be equivalent to the seventh-largest school 
district in the state if the recommendation is followed, said Lloyd Monserratt, 
a spokesman for school board member Vicki Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 Secession would not be easy, activists acknowledged. The Southeast area is the 
district's most overcrowded and would need to raise money for new buildings as 
well as compete with Los Angeles Unified for state funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Any effort to secede would need to begin with caution and a feasibility study, 
Escutia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro, Cooper and Escutia support an alternative plan proposed by the Latino 
Leadership Coalition for Education that would break Southeast schools into 
three clusters. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone is against the idea of a "super cluster." Huntington Park 
Principal Tony Garcia said many of his colleagues feel it is best to begin with 
a united Southeast cluster. "We stand a good chance of working together because 
we have worked together in the past," he said. If the "super cluster" failed, 
he said, the three high school complexes could become separate clusters later. 
</P>
<P>
 The superintendent is to send his recommendation on clusters to the school 
board in mid-April. The district hopes to implement the cluster proposal by 
July. MARY HELEN BERG

<P>
 The state Fair Political Practices Commission has fined Councilman Rodolfo 
(Rudy) Garcia $1,500 for violating state conflict-of-interest laws when he 
voted to fire City Manager William Vasquez last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia approached Vasquez in July, 1992, and, citing personal financial 
difficulties, asked Vasquez for a $1,000 loan, according to a commission 
report.Vasquez complied, giving Garcia the loan in cash. There was no written 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight months later, Garcia cast a key vote in a 3-2 city council decision to 
dismiss Vasquez. State law prohibits public officials from voting on matters 
involving people with whom they have loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia also failed to list Vasquez as a source of income on 1992 economic 
disclosure forms but later amended the financial statements, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Garcia was cooperative and candid with the commission and had no 
history of violations, the commission did not fine him the maximum penalty of 
$2,000, a commission spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said he had no idea his action was improper. He could not be reached 
for comment Friday. MARY HELEN BERG

 Supporters of the Huntington Park Police Boxing Club plan to pack City Hall 
Monday night and ask city leaders to keep their program alive. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-year-old club at 6414 Rugby Ave. is sponsored by the Police Department, 
and its $75,000 annual budget is funded with federal Community Development 
Block Grant money. 
</P>
<P>
 After monitoring the club last fall, city officials discovered that only about 
half the young participants were city residents. The City Council voted to 
discontinue funding at the end of the fiscal year, at the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is allowed to commit only 15% of its $1.9 million in block grant 
funds -- about $300,000 -- to public-service programs such as the boxing club, 
said Jack Wong, Community Development director. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us to fund the whole program and have only half the kids be residents 
here doesn't make sense," Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
 But club business manager Josie Rivera said that boxing has helped keep 5,000 
boys off the street and out of gangs since 1988 and that most participants 
attend Huntington Park schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you give the kids something and take it back when it is successful?" 
Rivera asked. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 parents have signed a petition asking the council to save the 
program, Rivera said. They hope the city will fund the club for one more year, 
giving organizers time to find another source of financial support. 
</P>
<P>
 The council meeting will begin at 7:30 p.m. at City Hall, 6550 Miles Ave. MARY

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: SOUTH GATE; ENGINEERING LESSON TAKES FLIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's amazing what you can do with Popsicle sticks and glue. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighth-graders at South Gate Junior High thought they were constructing model 
catapults for the second annual Catapult Design Competition, sponsored by the 
Associate Member Forum of the American Society of Civil Engineers. But they 
were building confidence and pride too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really great to design something of your own the way you want it, " 
said Lorena Navar, 14, who said she was not sure what a civil engineer was when 
she entered the contest. 
</P>
<P>
 That was before her all-girl team, the 5 Non-Blondes, surprised themselves by 
beating stereotypes -- and 17 other teams -- for first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're girls," Lorena said. "We thought the guys were going to win." 
</P>
<P>
 The contest was developed as part of the forum's efforts to promote awareness 
of civil engineering as a career and to encourage students to stay in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice as many students participated in the South Gate contest this year. The 
winners will receive scientific calculators and all students will receive 
certificates, said Mark Serna, chairman of the community outreach program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to provide role models for kids from economic backgrounds who may not 
have professionals around," Serna said. "We introduce (the students) to young 
engineers . . . so they can see that it's not as difficult as it may seem (to 
be an engineer). All you need is the education." 
</P>
<P>
 The 18 teams tinkered with their designs for a month before unveiling them for 
a contest of distance and accuracy. Models were held together with glue, twine 
and bungee cord. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5 Non-Blondes was the first team to compete. A hushed crowd watched as the 
catapult's triangular basket spit a fluorescent-orange golf ball 22.5 feet 
across the campus quad. Next, the team members estimated their catapult's 
accuracy and placed a board where they hoped the ball would land. The catapult 
arm pulled back -- and thwack -- the ball solidly hit its mark. The crowd 
roared as if watching the home team slam dunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers agreed that the outdoor competition helped students apply classroom 
lessons in a concrete way. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most important lesson was about cooperation, students said. 
</P>
<P>
 Red-haired Erica Sanchez, 14, who said her hair color brought the 5 
Non-Blondes their luck, summed it up: "I love this team." MARY HELEN BERG

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: WEST ADAMS; DAMAGED THEATER TO RAISE CURTAIN AGAIN 
</P>

<P>
 Lula Washington has choreographed some pretty fancy footwork in her career, 
but the daily efforts to continue her business after it was devastated by the 
recent earthquake have lately required all the creative energy she can muster. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been pretty crazy," Washington said. "I've had to get through a lot of 
red tape. But at least now I know I can get funds to rebuild." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's L.A. Contemporary Dance Theatre was one of hundreds of businesses 
that sustained quake damage, but one of the relatively few in Central Los 
Angeles forced to close its doors. After a month of appealing to the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency for aid -- she was initially turned down -- 
Washington said she is now assured of grant money once FEMA officials assess 
the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, she said, lay in the fact that disaster relief officials consider 
arts organizations "nonessential." Her battle to qualify for a FEMA grant drove 
her to enlist the help of Councilman Nate Holden, Rep. Maxine Waters, 
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore and others not directly involved in the arts, who 
vouched for the studio's importance to the local community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lula's not only an arts institution in the community, she runs a viable 
business that people benefit from in a lot of ways," said Moore spokeswoman Joy 
Atkinson, who cited Washington's theater as crucial to an after-school arts 
program recently launched by Moore's office. "The types of programs she runs 
are absolutely essential to the growth of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The theater, owned by Washington and her husband, Irwin, occupies two floors 
of studio and performance space in an industrial-style building at 5179 W. 
Adams Blvd. The 14-year-old nonprofit theater is known for its wide range of 
low-cost dance and tumbling classes for youth, and for its professional troupe 
that tours nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 But everything came to an abrupt halt Jan. 17 when the Northridge temblor 
shifted the studio roof, knocked out a back supporting wall and cracked several 
other walls. The damage was enough for city inspectors to red-tag the property, 
and Washington is awaiting the results of a stress test that will determine if 
the studio can be salvaged or whether it must be razed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Washington was left in an operational lurch. Classes for the 
studio's roughly 400 students were suspended, as were rehearsals for the youth 
and professional companies' upcoming performances. Washington was determined to 
continue with rehearsals for company performances, some of which were booked a 
year in advance. The next one is scheduled for April at Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt really bad about all of the kids calling every day asking: 'When are 
you going to open?' " Washington said. "But we had to get on somehow with 
rehearsals. That was the most critical thing." 
</P>
<P>
 With virtually no emergency or reserve funds, the Washingtons began hunting 
for a building that could donate rehearsal space. The search proved exhaustive 
but yielded three sites: the Colburn School of Performing Arts on Figueroa 
Street, the Los Angeles Theatre Centre in Downtown, and the Crossroads School 
in Santa Monica. Both the youth and professional companies are rehearsing, and 
classes for the youth company began last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington said FEMA has agreed to cover 90% of rebuilding costs, which could 
be more than $200,000. Washington, who staged fund-raisers for years before 
buying the property in 1989, said she is prepared to roll up her sleeves again 
to raise the balance of the rebuilding costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to stay right here in the community," she added. "People have told me: 
'This is the perfect chance to relocate in Culver City or Santa Monica.' But 
the greatest need is right here." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: WEST ADAMS; GROUP TO AID CUBA DESPITE EMBARGO

 Members of Pediatricians and Parents for Peace announced plans last week to 
deliver an ambulance and $100,000 worth of medical supplies to children in 
Cuba, defying the U.S. trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 At a press conference at Holman United Methodist Church, eight members of the 
local nonprofit group, including radio personality Casey Kasem and Holman 
pastor James Lawson, spoke out against the embargo. The group announced plans 
to travel through the Southwest and then to Tantampico, Mexico, where they will 
board planes for Cuba on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they will be committing an act of civil disobedience, pediatrician 
Hesham Ragab said that denying basic medical supplies to children and 
potentially contributing to the spread of disease is a far greater crime.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've had standoffs at the border, but that hasn't prevented the supplies 
from getting through," said Ragab, who founded the 250-member group a year ago. 
"We need to make as many trips as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The group, along with the Minneapolis-based Pastors for Peace, operates 12 
caravans nationwide to get medical supplies and other humanitarian aid into 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 The current West Coast caravan originated in Canada 1 1/2 weeks ago, gaining 
more supplies and people as it stopped at various sites, including Los Angeles. 
Ragab said that the group will move next through Arizona, New Mexico and Texas 
before loading the supplies onto a freighter in Mexico. The group plans to 
arrive in Cuba on Friday, the same day as the supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson, who acts as an adviser to the organization, said Pediatricians and 
Parents for Peace is "quite a remarkable group. What they do is a kind of 
symbolic action that demonstrates to people the need to get involved in 
changing public policies. (The U.S. embargo) is hurting kids, and it doesn't 
matter if it's in Cuba or here, it's got to change." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: LITTLE TOKYO; HOTEL REACHES OUT TO AFRICAN AMERICANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The menu was distinctly Japanese -- a bento (box) lunch of teriyaki chicken 
and grilled salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rest of the recent noontime program at the New Otani Hotel was 
dedicated to celebrating African American -- not Japanese -- culture. 
Motivational speaker Cindy Harper fired up the audience of several hundred with 
encouraging words such as: "You've got to fight the negativity that bombards 
you." And designer Ahneva Ahneva's fashion show of African-inspired clothing 
elicited hoots, hollers and enthusiastic applause. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look around the room at all of the different colors of clothing and the ebony 
hue . . . and give yourself some applause," the Rev. Anthony Johnson of the 
Jordan Covenant Church told the ballroom full of people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese-owned New Otani hosted the African American Cultural Exchange 
Luncheon on Feb. 25 as part of its effort to reach out to other ethnic groups. 
The 16-year-old hotel at 120 S. Los Angeles St. has long been considered a 
business that specifically caters to Japanese tourists and business people, but 
officials vowed this year to improve its community relations efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in existence not just for business; we like to be the center of the 
community," said Kenji Yoshimoto, general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the past, the hotel focused on introducing and sharing Japanese culture 
with the public, holding free events like the New Year's Day celebration and 
flower-arranging and tea ceremony demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, the hotel began its campaign to spotlight other cultures by 
inviting members of the Filipino community to a luncheon. And with Black 
History Month in February, an African American luncheon seemed a natural second 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 Trish Butler, New Otani catering office manager, organized the event, calling 
on her contacts in the African American community for help. Tickets were $10. 
Local artists and authors displayed their works in a mini-marketplace in the 
foyer. 
</P>
<P>
 And as attendees finished their "soul bento " lunch, the energetic Harper 
called on them to focus on positive attitudes and actions. "Realize you're 
going to fall . . . but if you fall, pick yourself up and keep on going," said 
Harper, who repeatedly called on audience affirmation by asking, "Right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ahneva's grand-finale fashion show was also spirited and inspirational, with 
the designer providing snippets of African history and lessons on textiles as 
she introduced her fashions, which blend imported, handwoven African fabrics 
with more common materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ladies, you can go to work in your culture," Ahneva said, as a model walked 
down the runway in a black wool gabardine suit with intricate gold accents. 
Audience members sighed appreciatively as models showed off colorful yet regal 
formal gowns made with traditional fabrics from Senegal, Nigeria and Ghana. 
</P>
<P>
 And the mostly female audience came alive with cheers and catcalls when male 
models displayed mud-cloth vests, patterned jackets and even tuxedos made with 
printed cloth. "Men, it's time for you to get rid of that ugly black tuxedo," 
Ahneva said, as the men strutted and danced down the runway and audience 
members melodramatically fanned themselves with napkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Luncheon attendees had nothing but praise for the event, saying that even if 
it was merely a marketing ploy for the hotel, they appreciated it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good ploy, because African Americans are consumers," said Donald 
Lovett, a community mediator for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. 
"It was absolutely wonderful, very well presented." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a way to mend L.A.," said free-lance photographer Maril Delly, who 
displayed her works. And the rave reviews from city employees Valerie Works and 
Jannette Allen are bound to please hotel officials. "The hotel is beautiful, 
and I had the misconception that this was mostly a hotel for the Japanese," 
Works said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Allen: "I'll be back to see what the other cultural programs are like."

<P>
 A vacant kindergarten classroom at Castelar Elementary School has been turned 
into the Parent Center, where local families can come for medical and dental 
screenings, counseling and educational seminars -- all in their native 
languages. 
</P>
<P>
 The new center, which school officials showed off to the public last week, was 
opened with money received from the state Healthy Starts program, which 
provides social services to low-income families at schools for convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 Castelar received $400,000 to provide assistance over three years at the 
school at 840 Yale St. The school works in partnership with the Chinatown 
Service Center, the Asian American Drug Abuse Program, the county Department of 
Children's Services' Asian Pacific Project and the county Probation 
Department's Asian Gang Unit to provide the services at no or low cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parent Center is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays; counseling later in 
the evening is available by appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 A large central room can accommodate as many as 30 in the parenting classes 
and an after-school homework club for students. Two smaller, enclosed offices 
provide privacy for individual counseling sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Two full- and two part-time social workers, who speak Chinese, Spanish, 
Vietnamese, Laotian and Thai, staff the center on a daily basis. The partner 
agencies and more than a dozen other organizations, such as USC Dental School 
and Clinica Msr. Oscar A. Romero, offer families bilingual assistance with drug 
and mental health counselors, doctors, nurses, dental hygienists and gang 
experts on a periodic basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The bilingual parenting classes, currently offered in Spanish and Chinese, are 
scheduled throughout the day and will be repeated again in a few months to 
accommodate work schedules, said Anthony Chee, project coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Castelar Principal Dore Wong and Larry Lue, Chinatown Service Center's 
counseling director, applied for the state grant in an effort to provide 
services to local families, many of whom are new immigrants, within walking 
distance and in languages they could understand. 
</P>
<P>
 In their application, Wong and Lue highlighted the bilingual and cultural 
needs of the community and identified these key needs: drug and gang activity 
prevention, dental care, counseling and parent education, particularly to help 
new immigrants cope with such stresses as parent-child role reversals. 
</P>
<P>
 Dental care is often neglected by local families, either because of cost or a 
reluctance to go to doctors outside of Chinatown, Wong said. Of 160 
sixth-graders checked one year during routine exams at Castelar, 110 needed 
some type of dental work, Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies also indicated that Castelar families are among the poorest 6% in the 
county, with 43% on welfare, according to statistics from Castelar officials.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: WINDSOR SQUARE; 100 AWARDS GIVEN ON EBELL CENTENNIAL 
</P>

<P>
 The Ebell of Los Angeles, a social, educational and philanthropic 
organization, continued the celebration of its 100th anniversary last week by 
awarding scholarships to 100 students from 23 local colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 The award ceremony at the group's historic Wilshire Ebell Theatre at Wilshire 
and Lucerne boulevards also included the dedication of a time capsule, to be 
opened in 2044, commemorating the group's centennial. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italian Renaissance-style theater and clubhouse, built in 1927, are 
designated as historic cultural monuments in Los Angeles and last month were 
recommended for listing in the National Register of Historic Places by the 
State Historical Resources Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1894, Dr. Adrian Ebell, who advocated widening the scope of women's 
education and organized a number of women's societies, founded the Ebell of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1920, the organization has awarded more than $9 million in scholarships 
to young men and women, said Gloria Carroll, the scholarship program's 
chairwoman. This year's scholarship winners will receive $2,000 a year for up 
to three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization's facilities are used frequently by a number of community and 
cultural organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 At various times in the past, the Ebell housed a Red Cross unit, served as an 
air-raid shelter, was the site of USO dances and featured performances or 
speeches by such notables as Judy Garland, Madame Chiang Kai-Shek, Ronald 
Reagan, Carl Sandburg, Liberace and Amelia Earhart, in her last public 
appearance.

<P>
 A new unit of the Los Angeles city attorney's Victims Assistance Program will 
make it easier for Korean-speaking crime victims and witnesses to work with the 
criminal justice system and receive assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Special Emphasis Victim Assistance Program, established in December with a 
$60,000 federal grant, provides bilingual staff and volunteers to serve the 
Korean-speaking population. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the program, victims may file claims with the State Victims of Crime 
Compensation Fund for out-of-pocket medical and counseling expenses and lost 
wages resulting from injuries or trauma caused by a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 To file a claim, a victim or surviving family members must have filed a police 
report and must cooperate with police and prosecutors. Claims must be filed 
within a year of the crime. If the claim is approved, the fund provides up to 
$46,000 in reimbursements. The fund does not cover monetary losses or property 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great way to build a bridge between government and the community," 
said Tong Cho Kim, the Korean outreach program coordinator. "So many victims 
don't know that such a program exists. They are really surprised and pleased to 
learn about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members also explain court procedures to victims and witnesses and offer 
referrals to other services, Cho said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since December, Cho has received about 400 inquiries and helped file 120 
claims. About half of the cases involved robberies; others involved assaults, 
homicides and hit-and-run accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, the only one in the state targeting Korean-speaking victims, has 
attracted attention outside the county. Cho has received calls from victims in 
San Diego and Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Cho splits his time between the program's main office, 808 N. Spring St., and 
the field office at the Koreatown police substation, 3330 W. 8th St., where he 
is available from 1:30 to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday. Staff members in 
the city's main office also offer assistance in English, Spanish and Chinese.

CITY ARTS: THE WEALTH OF KHAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The name Genghis Khan evokes images of mounted Mongol warriors sweeping across 
the plains of Eurasia laying claim to a vast empire in the name of their fierce 
and cunning ruler. 
</P>
<P>
 But an unprecedented exhibition at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles, 
beginning today and running through May 22, provides a new understanding of the 
rich artistic and technological legacy cultivated under Khan's reign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Genghis Khan: Treasures from Inner Mongolia" features more than 200 
artifacts, gold ornamental plates, bronze weapons, silk garments, pottery, 
porcelain and funerary ware, much of it recently discovered during 
archeological digs in Inner Mongolia, one of the five autonomous border regions 
of China. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition spans a period from 2000 BC to the 14th Century and has never 
been shown before outside of China. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam T. Kessler, the exhibition's curator, said the Inner Mongolian 
discoveries are "highly revolutionary" because they force revisions in 
assumptions about the origins and development of art and technology in the 
region.

GROUP PICKETS SUPERVISOR'S OFFICE OVER PROPOSED BAN ON DAY LABORERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 30 members of a grass-roots immigrant advocacy group gathered at county 
Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke's Inglewood field office Monday to protest a 
proposed ordinance that would ban day laborers in unincorporated areas of the 
county, a measure prompted by heated complaints from residents of Ladera 
Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstrators represented about two-thirds of the Pro-Immigrant 
Mobilization Coalition, a group that advocates immigrant rights and opposes 
legislation that founder Alvaro Maldonado says unfairly targets immigrants and 
undocumented workers. The coalition has also sent a petition with 300 
signatures to Burke's office in protest of her position on the proposed 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're calling on Burke to do is to drop this bill," Maldonado said amid 
the protesters' strenuous shouts at passing cars and pedestrians. "There are 
very good alternatives to this Draconian bill she's proposing, which are in 
existence now in cities like Pasadena. If this bill passes, it won't prevent 
people from looking for work. It'll just be another part of the anti-immigrant 
hysteria and set a bad precedent." 
</P>
<P>
 The county ordinance proposed by Burke would prohibit workers from soliciting 
employment on public rights of way and in commercial parking lots, although 
property owners could allow day laborers to use parking lots as gathering 
sites. In some areas, such as Pasadena and Agoura Hills, work sites have been 
set up to accommodate laborers, providing them with restrooms and on-site 
mediators to act as community liaisons.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrators waited outside Inglewood Municipal Court, where Burke's field 
office is located, but did not see Burke or any of her representatives. Burke 
spokeswoman Vicki Pipkin said that although deputies did not intentionally 
avoid protesters, Burke believes that "confrontation is not necessarily the 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Pipkin added that an alternative to the ordinance is being pursued by Burke's 
office. Representatives are working with management at the HomeBase store at 
Slauson and Fairfax avenues, the site that touched off the furor, to set up 
restrooms and waiting facilities for day laborers. Pipkin said that officials 
hope to resolve property liability issues before the ordinance is brought 
before the Board of Supervisors Tuesday for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to find a site for the laborers, if not HomeBase, then somewhere 
else," Pipkin said. "The bottom line is, Ladera Heights is a residential and 
not a commercial district. That's why homeowners there have been the most vocal 
about the issue."  
</P>
<P>
 Raul Anorve, a Los Angeles resident and coalition member, said opponents of 
the measure must keep the pressure on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to keep saying, 'Look into alternatives to the problem.' We've even 
sent Burke a letter describing some," he said. "This isn't about war. We 
believe both sides can collaborate and work it out."

VOICES: IN PRAISE OF DORSEY; DESPITE ITS POOR IMAGE AMONG OUTSIDERS, A PARENT 
SAYS THE SCHOOL PROVIDES BLACKS WITH SOME OF THE DISTRICT'S BEST EDUCATIONAL 
OPPORTUNITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY REESE BOYKIN, Mary Reese Boykin is surprised at how often she hears 
people put down Dorsey High School, in the Crenshaw area. One of the students 
in the Inglewood High School teacher's English class told her once, I can't 
believe you send your daughter to that gangster school. Boykin says she 
wouldn't send her ninth-grader, Desiree, anywhere else. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dorsey High School has gotten more than its share of bad publicity lately. I 
realized how distorted its image is when a friend said she would just as soon 
send her daughter to Dorsey as push her into a fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Her reaction isn't unusual. In fact, since a shooting in the registration line 
on the first day of school, I have been asked, "When are you taking Desiree out 
of that school?" 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewing Dorsey close up, I feel content with it, both academically and 
socially. 
</P>
<P>
 My husband and I have talked with several parents of recent graduates who echo 
a common point: Some of the best educational opportunities in the district for 
African American students are at Dorsey High. 
</P>
<P>
 As I have talked with the staff, listened to students chatter and read the 
Dorsey Gram, the school newspaper, I am convinced that Dorsey promotes values 
that complement my home's, like having pride in your own school and community 
and defining yourself for yourself, even when others fail to acknowledge -- or 
even perceive -- your worth. 
</P>
<P>
 I admit that my husband and I were tempted to transfer Desiree after that 
first-day shooting. But a semester later, I am pleased we didn't.  
</P>
<P>
 I respect the principal, Dr. Jerelene Wells, and her hard-working 
administrative staff. A visionary, Wells stays on the lookout for programs that 
push the Dorsey student ahead.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For example, she brought a finance academy to Dorsey so students would think 
of running or owning businesses rather than being consumers only. Students 
serve a business apprenticeship during their senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 A law and government academy is planned for the spring with the help of two 
Dorsey teachers, former attorneys. As Wells sees things, "If we are to improve 
the quality of our students' lives, we must teach them how to use their money 
and how to use the law." 
</P>
<P>
 With so much good going on, I understand why Wells and her staff feel baffled 
-- and I can imagine disheartened and annoyed, too -- that only the negatives 
grab and define Dorsey in the media. 
</P>
<P>
 I appreciate the Dorsey teachers. When I accompanied Desiree to school on the 
first day to make sure the campus is accessible to her (she has cerebral 
palsy), I met her teachers and anticipated a good year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later, when teachers James Berger, Julia Coley, Jerry Goren, 
Marcia Kpodo, along with attorney Marcia Brewer, prepared students for the Mock 
Trial, I really got to see what an interdisciplinary force the Dorsey teachers 
are. Desiree was bailiff in the competition sponsored by the Constitutional 
Rights Foundation.  
</P>
<P>
 Teachers held up the name Dorsey to Mock Trial team members in the way parents 
hold up the family's surname in the admonition, "Child, go out there and do 
your best. You're a Johnson." They kept a standard before the students -- that 
Dorsey was the L.A. County Mock Trial champion in 1990, finished second in 1989 
and was in the top four in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers put in the time. 7 a.m. practices. After school until 4:30 p.m. On 
Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey finished in the final eight of 46 participating schools in L.A. County. 
</P>
<P>
 And Desiree, who initially kept mostly to herself, developed a new perspective 
on the law, met terrific friends and found a place to belong. 
</P>
<P>
 I like the spirit in the parents' groups. From participating in various groups 
to volunteering on campus, parents can find plenty of ways to be involved. Many 
are. 
</P>
<P>
 One evening at the meeting of Super Parents, an athletic booster club, parents 
talked about how they had walked the Crenshaw district -- selling raffle 
tickets and soliciting donations -- and raised $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 They were planning the annual barbecue when one asked, "Do we take money out 
of the treasury to buy the chicken and ribs?" 
</P>
<P>
 Another interrupted, "No! That's not the way we do things. We donate."  
</P>
<P>
 Joining the Dorsey parents are the perennial community supporters. Twenty or 
30 years ago, Dorsey served their children well. They are back to serve Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to dismiss Dorsey and other inner-city schools as the lot of those 
who don't have the resources to do better for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 But my daughter's attendance at Dorsey isn't a matter of resignation. It's a 
preference. 
</P>
<P>
 I strongly feel that we African Americans best rebuild our own communities 
when we value our institutions, including our neighborhood schools. 
</P>
<P>
 We must applaud the good. We must pull our load to resolve the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one thing I am certain of: I am at Dorsey for the long haul. And just 
like Desiree, I too have that Dorsey pride.

VOICES: LOOKING TO THE EAST FOR CURES TO WESTERN PAIN; INITIALLY SKEPTICAL OF 
ORIENTAL MEDICINE, TIMOTHY TIMMONS NOW TOUTS THE VIRTUES OF THE DISCIPLINE AS A 
DEAN AT SAMRA UNIVERSITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, Timothy Timmons, 35, has been the academic dean at Samra 
University of Oriental Medicine for two years. The 25-year-old university, at 
600 St. Paul Ave. in Downtown, has 300 students from more than 15 countries, 
and administrators say it is the oldest and largest school of Eastern medicine 
in the United States. Classes are taught in English, Mandarin and Korean. In 
1979, Samra became the first school of Eastern medicine to be accredited by the 
state Department of Education. Timmons is a supervisor at Samra's clinic and 
teaches classes in Eastern medical theory and the study of herbs. He was 
interviewed by Kirby Lee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Practitioners in Oriental medicine are not only trained in acupuncture but 
also in nutrition counseling, herbal medicine, exercise therapy and massage. 
</P>
<P>
 We can't perform surgery in the United States, but Oriental medicine is 
especially well suited for patients with chronic degenerative conditions and 
pain. If the patient has acute symptoms, such as an infection or a high fever, 
that clearly warrant Western medical and antibiotic therapies, then we refer 
the patient to tests right away. 
</P>
<P>
 Most patients, though, are coming into our clinic with Western diagnoses 
already in hand and are seeking additional care in conjunction with their 
Western physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Although our clinic treats Asian patients, we see people from all ethnic 
backgrounds. We see people with conditions ranging from neck and back pain, 
sports injuries, gynecological and digestive complaints to stroke 
rehabilitation, cancer, depression and chemical dependency. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, we've been seeing an increasing number of patients with HIV. Samra 
is setting up a pilot study in using Oriental medicine to increase blood cell 
counts in HIV patients. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the reasons why more people with chronic degenerative conditions are 
turning to our profession is that acupuncture stimulates the body to function 
more efficiently so that it can heal itself. 
</P>
<P>
 At Samra, we are trying to establish a field of integrative medicine whereby 
we train students to work with Western physicians to combine the best of both 
medical treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 This notion of complementary medicine also hits on a personal note. My wife, 
Christine, who is Chinese, is studying Western medicine at the College of 
Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific in Pomona. We both realize the two systems 
of medicine have something to offer each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Our profession is licensed as a primary health care service by the state, and 
patients do not need a physician's referral. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Western doctors view Oriental medicine with skepticism when they first 
encounter it because there has been insufficient research underlying 
acupuncture in this country. To those physicians, I would recommend open-minded 
skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way I approached it at first. 
</P>
<P>
 I was a premed student at UC Berkeley in 1977 when my grandfather, who was 
suffering from tuberculosis, fell and broke his hip. Following his surgery, he 
responded poorly to the conventional physical therapies and medications 
designed to alleviate his postoperative pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Left with few options, my family began to research alternative therapies. No 
one in my family had any experience with Oriental medicine, but we decided to 
give it a try because we had nothing to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Acupuncture helped alleviate his hip pain tremendously, and herbs helped him 
control his night sweats and coughing blood from his tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Intrigued by the results, I decided to enroll at the American College of 
Traditional Chinese Medicine in San Francisco in 1980 after finishing my premed 
studies. At first, it was more of a curiosity, but I've been studying it ever 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Chinese medicine is thought to have its roots around 200 B.C., the 
movement to translate books into English is only a recent undertaking. There is 
a wealth of information to go after, and Western culture has really only seen 
the tip of the iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
 When I first started to study Oriental medicine, there were very few 
practitioners. Now, there are more than 3,000 medical doctors and osteopaths 
who use acupuncture in the United States.  
</P>
<P>
 I spent two years in China, Taiwan and Malaysia working in different clinics 
and research hospitals. I can read and understand Chinese, but I do not speak 
well enough to teach classes. Since the 1970s, there has been a steady stream 
of Western doctors going to Asia to learn about Oriental medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an exciting time for me and my profession. Many principles of Oriental 
medicine coincide with the most significant developments in health care today.

MISPERCEPTIONS OF BROADWAY'S VITALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for the article on Broadway ("At the Crossroads," Feb. 13). You have 
managed to capture so much of the essence of what that area is and means to so 
many people.It is also an important distinction that the street was not taken 
over by Latino L.A. -- but abandoned by the "mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
 Since moving to Los Angeles seven months ago, I have been to Broadway at least 
once a week, every week, to buy clothes, shop for groceries, eat lunch or just 
enjoy a Saturday afternoon. And the prices on almost everything are so much 
better than just four blocks west! I have often wondered why people are afraid 
of the street and tried to coax them out of their misperceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a USC film student and, with my partner, was given the opportunity to 
make a short film this semester. When we sat down to figure out what to make 
the film about, our very first idea was to do a documentary on Broadway. The 
street is so rich with stories that our only challenge has been to decide what 
not to include! 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a lesson that we can take from the street, it is that Broadway is 
as alive as it has ever been. For every troublemaker on the street, there are 
many more hard-working and industrious patrons, employees or business people. 
All the street needs is a little more attention and love from the "mainstream" 
that never gave it a second chance.

 I wish to thank you for your piece ("Castle Keep," Jan. 2) on my former

this lovely structure and it brought back many happy memories which I and my

CITY 4-A BOYS' FINALS; CRENSHAW WEARS ANOTHER CROWN; CHAMPIONSHIP: THE COUGARS 
RELY ON DEPTH TO MAUL THE DONS, 72-53, BECAUSE THEIR TOP GUNS HAVE TROUBLE 
FINDING THE TARGET.

<P>
 For the third time this season Dorsey played cross-town rival Crenshaw -- and 
for the third time the Dons lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The third loss, 72-53, came Friday night in the City Section 4-A Division 
finals before 6,500 fans at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars, who won their second consecutive City title, are going to need a 
laundry to keep their record 13 City title banners clean. 
</P>
<P>
 Tremaine Fowlkes led Crenshaw with 18 points and 16 rebounds. Kristaan 
Johnson, the 1993 City 4-A Player of the Year, had only eight points before 
fouling out with 4:56 left in the fourth quarter. Reggie McFerren, the Cougars' 
other top scorer, had seven points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any of our top players had a good game, including Tremaine," 
Crenshaw Coach Willie West said. "We were flat. I don't know for what reason. 
We were not fired up, but we still won." 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw has won seven games in a row during the last three seasons against 
Dorsey, including league drubbings of 33 and 47 points this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw's big three scorers -- Johnson, Fowlkes and McFerren -- together 
missed their first eight shots. The Dons came out aggressively and held a 10-7 
lead midway in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Cougars took advantage of their depth and went on a 9-2 run to take a 
16-12 lead at the first quarter. That lead grew to 31-23 at halftime as the 
Dons managed only two field goals and missed all four of their free throws in 
the second quarter. Dorsey was seven-for-14 from the free-throw line in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars traded baskets with Dorsey for the first six minutes of the third 
quarter before going on a 7-1 spurt to take a 47-34 lead. The Dons could not 
get closer than nine points in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey guard Ricky Blackmon had 17 points before fouling out with 3:38 left in 
the game. With Friday night's victory, Crenshaw received an automatic bid to 
the State tournament and will begin defense of its Division I title Tuesday in 
the Southern Regionals. However, Dorsey will not get the City's second 
nomination, unlike last season when the Dons were runners-up. That at-large bid 
may go to Fremont (22-6), which lost to the Cougars, 96-77, in the semifinals 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 If everything goes as expected, the Cougars hope to play Santa Ana Mater Dei 
on Saturday at Anaheim Stadium, in a rematch of last season's Southern 
Regional. The Cougars have won a record five State titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Records: Crenshaw 25-2; Dorsey 16-9.

SOUTHERN SECTION FINALS; VERBUM DEI WINS 1ST TITLE SINCE 1979 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY BAUM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The words were different, but Andre Miller and Damian Cantrell had the same 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I should take over," said Miller of Verbum Dei High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted the ball," affirmed Cantrell of Oxnard Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
 The two seniors got their wishes. But missed shots proved the difference as 
the Eagles overcame the Saints, 71-65, to win the Southern Section Division 4-A 
championship Friday night at the UC Irvine Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, a 6-foot-2 guard, scored a team-high 32 points, including 24 in the 
first half when the Eagles took a 44-34 lead at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the second half, the 6-4 Cantrell scored 21 of his 37 points, including 
eight in the first three minutes of the fourth quarter, to put the Saints 
ahead, 59-58. 
</P>
<P>
 Verbum Dei then went on a decisive 10-2 run to take a 70-63 lead with 29 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who guarded Cantrell in the fourth quarter, was impressed by his 
opponent. "He took it to me," said Miller, who shot 12-of-21 and grabbed 10 
rebounds. "He wasn't afraid to play and he took it to the basket." 
</P>
<P>
 Cantrell made 16 of 31 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Eagle Coach Mike Kearney: "I did catch on to (Miller's) ear about trying 
to stop this kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Verbum Dei, which lost CIF title games in 1990 (Santa Clara), 1991 (Santa 
Clara) and 1993 (Serra), won its first championship since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 A considerable free throw disparity cost the Saints, who made seven of nine; 
the Eagles hit 13 of 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we didn't get some breaks on some calls," said Lou Cvijanovich, who 
has coached the Saints to 13 titles in 36 seasons. But, he said, "Everybody in 
the stands thought when we got down by 10 we'd get blown out. That wasn't the 
case." 
</P>
<P>
 Cvijanovich made a defensive switch to start the second half, putting 6-3 
senior Jess Pena on Miller, replacing the slower Cantrell. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller scored only eight points after the break. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamal Cobbs scored 17 points and Deon Williams added 10 for the Eagles. Pena, 
who had 10, was the only other Saint besides Cantrell to score in double 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
 But it came down to a game of two. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cvijanovich: "It's always exciting to see outstanding basketball players. 
We had one and they had one." 
</P>
<P>
 Records: Verbum Dei 24-2; Santa Clara 19-8.

SOCCER; BELMONT, BELL HAVE A SCORE TO SETTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LAVIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight years ago Bell and Belmont clashed in a City Section soccer championship 
-- and every contest since then has been a grudge match. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles (12-0-1) and Sentinels (9-1-2) vied for the title Saturday 
afternoon at Birmingham High in Van Nuys. (See Sports, Section C, for results.) 
Both teams have a similar style -- low one-touch passes and fast breaks. Both 
have qualified for the finals three times since 1986. Both have a City title 
under their belt. 
</P>
<P>
 And both have a score to settle. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the Eagles played the Sentinels was in the first round of last 
season's playoffs. Undefeated Belmont was favored to make a run for the City 
title, but Bell, a wild-card entry, knocked the Sentinels out in a penalty kick 
shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles also defeated Belmont in the semifinals in 1991, the year they went 
on to win their first City championship. And the only time both teams met in 
the finals, in 1986, Belmont was the winner. Thursday Semifinals 
</P>
<P>
 Belmont 2, San Pedro 1 -- Sentinel strikers Julio Vidrio and Nelson Moran each 
scored in the first half at Daniels Field to hand the No. 2 seeded Pirates 
(11-1-1) their sole loss. 
</P>
<P>
 After 20 minutes of constant pressure, Vidrio scored on a header from a pass 
by Fernando Bautista. It was close to halftime when Jose Salmeron served Nelson 
Moran a pass between two defenders for a fast break and another goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates scored five minutes into the second half on a Sentinel defensive 
error. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell 2, Kennedy 0 -- Striker Maynor Alvarez scored two second-half goals for 
the Eagles to shut out fourth-seeded Kennedy (9-2) in a semifinal match at 
Bell. Tuesday Quarterfinals 
</P>
<P>
 Bell 3, Van Nuys 1 (OT) -- Oswaldo Williams and Luis Castillo each scored in 
the waning minutes of overtime for the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolves (7-3-2) were on the scoreboard first with an unassisted goal by 
Federico Arroyo. With 10 minutes left in regulation, Ernesto Serratos, who was 
playing goalie for most of the game, was moved to forward and scored the tying 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 San Pedro 5, Locke 2 -- In a tightly contested first half, Locke opened the 
scoring with a goal by Sergio Huerta on a breakaway at the 15-minute mark. The 
Pirates tied 10 minutes later and tallied again with two minutes before the 
half for the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints (7-2-1) tied it at 2 two minutes into the second half with senior 
Ricardo Chavez's 13th goal of the season -- a header from a cross by Alberto 
Trujillo. The Pirates then scored three quick goals on a break away and two 
penalty kicks for a decisive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Belmont 4, Garfield 0 (OT) -- The Sentinels found a crack in the Bulldogs' 
goal in overtime. The first shot came off a corner kick by Fernando Bautista on 
a header in the 84th minute. Edwin Barahona followed with another goal from a 
free kick and Eric Hernandez tallied his 13th. Salvador Gochez made the last 
goal. Southern Section 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Gardens 1, Harvard-Westlake 0 (OT) -- Gustavo Garita scored on a volley 
at close range from a throw-in by Roberto Arredondo five minutes into overtime. 
The victory broke the Wolverines' 24-game unbeaten streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, Bell Gardens (20-5-3) played Burbank Burroughs (14-6-3) at 
Cerritos Gahr High in search of their third Southern Section Division III 
title. (See Sports, Section C, for results.)

WRESTLING; BELL HIGH WRESTLERS REPEAT CITY SECTION CHAMPION FEAT 
</P>

<P>
 The Bell High School wrestling team edged out the visiting squad from El 
Camino Real to repeat as City Section champs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We take a lot of pride in winning back-to-back championships because we 
haven't been around for very long," Bell Coach Frank O'Connor said of the 
school's 4-year-old program."The Valley schools wanted to win the title back 
but we wanted to keep it in the city, and we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the seven wrestlers the Eagles placed in the Feb. 26 finals at Bell, Jose 
Gonzales (112-pound class), Ramses Ochoa (145), Frank Ordorica (171), Jesus 
Orozco (189) and Adolfo Padilla (heavyweight) won in their respective weight 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Orozco, whose victory in the City championship had been preceded twice by 
losses, was voted outstanding wrestler of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales' victory marked his third championship in as many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales, Ochoa, Ordorica, Orozco and Padilla advanced to this weekend's State 
championship at the University of the Pacific in Stockton.

HOUSEMATE TREND GROWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER BENNETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Bennett is a free-lance writer who 
lives in La Verne. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Griffin and Brennan Byers couldn't be more different. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin is a sales rep and single father of three small children. Salt-and- 
pepper hair creasing his temples, he thinks daily about meeting his monthly 
sales quota and caring for his kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Byers is an actor and leather worker who has never been married. He starts 
each morning with a long swim and a quick scan of Daily Variety before 
retreating to his upstairs studio. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men do have one thing in common: They both have housemates. But even 
this life-style choice takes them down very different paths. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin lives about a mile from the ocean in a Newport Beach mobile home with 
a fellow salesman whom he rarely sees. Byers lives with a single mother of 
three college-age daughters in her roomy, two-story California bungalow in 
South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finding a roommate helped me land back on my feet," said Griffin, who owned a 
home in La Verne before his divorce. "There isn't a lot of room, but it's 
affordable, and I'm close to the beach, which is great for my kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Byers: "There's no other way I could afford to live in this house or 
this community." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin and Byers are among the growing number of Americans who are sharing 
their living quarters. From 1980 to 1990, the number of people who checked the 
"roommate" box on the U.S. Census form rose from 3.3 million to 4.1 million. In 
California, the number rose from 640,924 to 900,633. 
</P>
<P>
 People are doubling up not only for financial reasons, but also for security, 
companionship, sharing household chores, launching a new career or even 
reducing dependence on day care. And for older people, home sharing can often 
mean new independence as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may simply mean having someone nearby to help you reach a can of beans 
from the top shelf," said Leo Baldwin, author of "Homesharing and Other 
Lifestyle Options." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's clearly a better alternative than waiting all month, hoping your 
grandson will stop by," Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 A compatible housemate can also have social advantages. "If you have trouble 
meeting men and women, move in with someone who has no trouble meeting people," 
said Bruce Brown, author of "The Complete Roommate Handbook." 
</P>
<P>
 "Their leftovers will be perfect for you," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a little creativity, housemates can even help you buy a house. 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Rodriguez, a Glendora-based realtor with Century 21, said one of her 
clients bought a house that was being rented by three female housemates. 
Instead of giving them notice to vacate, the buyer moved in with them. "He 
didn't even ask for the master bedroom," she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Another client of hers bought a house with a co-signer, then promptly found 
two housemates to help him meet his monthly mortgage. "That way," Rodriguez 
said, "instead of sharing equity in his home, which was popular in the '80s, he 
was building up the equity all for himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Harmon, director of the National Shared Housing Resource Center, a 
nonprofit clearinghouse in Burlington, Vt., for more than 450 shared-housing 
programs around the country, believes the trend is fueled by several social and 
economic factors, including a growing population of singles, high housing 
costs, low wages and an erosion of the stubborn American ethic, which equates 
independence with living alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much emphasis on this notion of independent living, that even if 
people feel lonely and isolated, they figure that's what they're supposed to 
do," said Harmon, a single parent who has reared her children in shared housing 
since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, when Maxine Nelson, owner of RoomMate Finders, the oldest roommate 
matching and referral service in the United States, asked some of her recent 
upscale clients whether they wanted to be interviewed for this story, they 
declined because of what they cited was home sharing's negative image. 
</P>
<P>
 "As lawyers, doctors and accountants, who could certainly afford to have their 
own place, they didn't want to advertise that they chose to live with a 
housemate," she said. "They thought it would tarnish the public's perception of 
them as successful, independent professionals." 
</P>
<P>
 Author Brown said that even these professionals, however, recognize that 
roommates give them more, not fewer, lifestyle options. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing what you can do with the proper roommate situation," he added, 
"if you just take some calculated risks." 
</P>
<P>
 Your calculations should begin with assessing whether you would make a good 
candidate for sharing a house or apartment. For example, if you have a 
disability, you may wish to extend a portion or all of the rent for an exchange 
in service. If you have grown children who have moved out, you may wish to 
invite a college student to live with you to revitalize your household. If 
you're a divorced mother with three children, you may choose to live with 
another single parent who works different hours than you so you can reduce your 
child-care expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But that's only the first step. If home sharing seems a viable alternative for 
meeting some of your needs, you next need to visualize your perfect housemate 
and also determine whether you're someone that other people can live with. 
</P>
<P>
 Test your roommate potential by composing a list of preferences. For example, 
ask yourself how you feel about age, education, pets, smoking, music and 
several other lifestyle choices. 
</P>
<P>
 "I counsel home sharers and home seekers alike to thoroughly explore their 
preferences and expectations at the outset," said Dorothy Pray, director of the 
Inland Mediation Board, a government-sponsored referral service in the Inland 
Empire. "This can prevent disastrous consequences later on." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Deanna Sclar, author of "Housemates: A Practical Guide to Living With 
Other People," "Decide what the real limits of your tolerance are, regardless 
of what you feel they should be." 
</P>
<P>
 There are several sources that can assist your housemate hunt. If you're a 
member of a professional organization, put the word out to your colleagues or 
place an ad in the group's newsletter. Brown doesn't recommend home sharing 
with a co-worker, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "Office politics can be stressful," he said, "and it's not fun to have to 
constantly watch what you say to your ever-present roommate for fear that it 
might come back to haunt you or even get you fired." 
</P>
<P>
 Other leads for roommates can come from church bulletins, university kiosks, 
college housing offices and your local newspaper. Advertising in papers 
involves less risk than in the past because seekers and providers can use voice 
mail and answering services to screen callers. (See accompanying story on how 
to write an ad.) 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't want to pursue your search alone, consider using a 
roommate-matching service. Many are affiliated with local senior centers or 
city and county housing departments. These nonprofit organizations typically 
provide potential housemates with a long checklist to help them improve their 
chances of making a good match. 
</P>
<P>
 They also help potential sharers complete home-sharing agreements, monitor 
newly made matches and even act as referees to settle disputes. Fees are 
generally small. At the Pasadena Senior Center, for example, clients pay $5 to 
register and $25 for a match, which is split between the seeker and provider. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of nonprofit organizations conduct employment and criminal checks 
and ask applicants to sign a statement saying they haven't been convicted of a 
misdemeanor or felony; however, many simply don't have resources to verify this 
information. As a result, most agencies also ask you to sign a release of 
responsibility form. 
</P>
<P>
 RoomMate Finders, a for-profit service, charges clients $95. Clients can also 
order a credit check for $15 and a check of court records for $45. Of course, 
if your new tenant or home sharer has just moved from another state, your check 
of court records would be worthless unless done for each state. 
</P>
<P>
 After a promising phone interview, prospective housemates should agree to meet 
at a neutral site such as a coffee shop, shared-housing experts agree. If the 
face-to-face meeting goes well, only then should you visit the place you'll be 
sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's much easier to say no in a public place than inside your own home," 
author Baldwin cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you've found your new housemate, both of you need to write your 
home-sharing agreement. Such a contract can be more difficult than hammering 
out a Middle East peace accord. Without one, however, bathrooms and kitchens 
can become battlefields, and such issues as finances, parking and privacy can 
become powder kegs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Be as detailed as possible without shackling either or both of you," Baldwin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of a commitment to keep the house clean, for example, Sclar recommends 
the "Summer Camp Method," which lists specific chores and the times they need 
to be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 After the parties are happy with their agreement, they should sign a contract. 
It can be renewed monthly. "That's still the best way I know to get the rent 
paid," Pray added. 
</P>
<P>
 To test a new agreement, Baldwin suggested actually living with your potential 
housemate for a weekend, an entire week or even longer. "If you find yourself 
thinking of ways you plan to change the housemate's behavior, your home sharing 
could be in trouble from the beginning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their fears of living with a stranger, homeowner Floydie Davis, 80, of 
Altadena, and home seeker Eliza Dangerfield, 74, recently became housemates. 
Matched by the Pasadena Senior Center, the two widows said they decided they 
were just too nervous to live alone any longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Eliza, who now drives Floydie to the grocery store and her doctor 
appointments: "We just agree not to disagree. I hate to cook, but I love to 
eat, so she does the cooking, and I do the cleaning." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Floydie, who is now able to comfortably maintain her home with Eliza's 
help, "We just blend in; we're very happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne Bell, 24, and Marina Sousa, 22, have also decided to home share, 
although just two weeks ago they didn't even know each other. Bell, a director 
of a service that prepares students for the SAT tests, didn't relish the 
prospect of paying $1,195 for another month's rent on her two-bedroom Brentwood 
apartment. Sousa, a design student from a small rural town in Northern 
California, was new to Los Angeles and wanted one person, a housemate, who knew 
that she was "alive down here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After checking some seedy one-bedroom places that were "ridiculously 
expensive," she visited RoomMate Finders, who interviewed her and gave her 16 
pages of referrals. Her interviewer then pared her list to about 10 choices, 
including Bell, one of the company's clients. Bell had contracted the service 
because she said she had neither the time nor the experience to conduct a 
proper search for a housemate. 
</P>
<P>
 From her list, Sousa found Bell two hours before she was to go back home. They 
had a few follow-up phone calls over the next few weeks before making the 
decision to live with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the two go jogging together. Bell, an exercise freak, takes Sousa to her 
dance studio, and Sousa, a movie buff, gets Bell to see films before they 
become available on videocassette.

OLYMPIC PREPARES FOR YOUTH BOXING'S OPENING BELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aspiring young boxers will no longer have to sit in the balcony of the Grand 
Olympic Auditorium and wonder if they will get to fight. Their chance may come 
as early as April 29. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to staging professional fights, the newly refurbished Grand 
Olympic Sports Complex will also house a boxing and fitness center for youths 
from the Central City. 
</P>
<P>
 Located adjacent to the auditorium, the sports complex will be geared toward 
minority athletes who want to improve their conditioning and develop their 
boxing techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of the new building was to provide low-cost membership to a 
full-service gym for youths from the neglected areas," said Jeff Harper, 
project manager of RLA, formerly known as Rebuild LA. 
</P>
<P>
 RLA organized the new facility, enlisting the help of Jack Needleman, boxing 
trainer Richard Allen and businessman Ken Germano. 
</P>
<P>
 Needleman, who purchased the Olympic at 333 W. Washington Blvd. from the Los 
Angeles Athletic Club in 1980, donated the building to house the gym and 
fitness center. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, who is also director of the Hoover Street Gym, will run the boxing 
facility. Eight other trainers will help supervise the youth boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 The gym will include three training rings with professional ropes, 10 to 12 
heavy bags, and eight to 10 speed bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Amateurs, 8 and older, are invited to the gym, which will be open daily from 6 
a.m. to 10 p.m. The cost for boxing training will be $10 to $15 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel this is an excellent program to allow at-risk youths an opportunity 
to get involved in boxing, to develop confidence and self-esteem," said Allen, 
who hopes to have 300 boxers join. "These kids can box to any level they want. 
They will receive training whether they want to have fun, represent their 
country in the Olympics or compete at the professional level." 
</P>
<P>
 The new center was paid for in part by a $66,600 grant from the Lincy 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen also expects students from neighboring Los Angeles Trade Tech, 
businessmen, yuppie boxers and professional fighters to join. Public workouts 
will be on Saturdays to give amateur boxers an opportunity to work out in front 
of an audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The fitness center will operate separately from the boxing gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Germano, founder and president of Operation Fit Kids, has already provided 
fitness equipment for 25 high schools in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 Nautilus, StairMaster, Star Trac Treadmills by Unisen, the Step Co. of Atlanta 
and L.A. Fitness Club donated exercise equipment for the fitness center. It is 
the first inner-city facility of its kind in the country and a prototype for 
future fitness centers, Germano said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a desire on the part of Jack Needleman, who owns the Olympic, to 
develop an inner-city health facility," Germano said. "As far as health club 
chains go, this is the same type of operation at a much lesser membership cost. 
The money it generates will be for additional personnel and create jobs for 
people who aspire to be fitness instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 The fitness center will be open to all ages, but those younger than 16 will 
have to be accompanied by an adult. Cost for the fitness center is $15 a month.

CITY 3-A BOYS' FINALS; ROOSEVELT ROUGHRIDERS PULL UP LAME IN HOME STRETCH, 
56-55 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 How does one of the area's least-publicized high school basketball teams rise 
from obscurity to the heights of the City Section 3-A boys championship game? 
</P>
<P>
 While Crenshaw kicked down the door this season on its way to the 4-A final, 
Roosevelt used a more surreptitious approach to the 3-A final, sneaking in the 
back door. 
</P>
<P>
 But the defending champion Banning Pilots were rude hosts, defeating 
Roosevelt, 56-55, in overtime Friday at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people didn't expect us to be here but we made it," said Roosevelt 
Coach David Perea. "Even though we lost, there are 14 other teams that wish 
they were here." 
</P>
<P>
 Center Paul Burgueno, who scored 13 points in the game, hit two free throws to 
bring Roosevelt within 56-55 with 38.3 remaining in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 After a Pilot turnover, their 24th of the game, Roosevelt's Mario Hernandez 
missed a game-winning three-pointer with three seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got the ball in the hands of our best shooter but he just missed the 
shot," Perea said of Hernandez, who led the team with 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez hit a short baseline jumper with 1:15 left in the third quarter to 
extend Roosevelt's lead to 40-34. But the Pilots came back at the end of the 
fourth quarter with 11 unanswered points. Banning guard Jason Pickett, who led 
all players with 23 points, hit a layup with 1:34 left in regulation to tie the 
score at 53. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been down in games before and were able to come back," Pickett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Banning Coach Marc Paez: "The team looked at the scoreboard and realized 
they didn't want to lose. That was all the coaching they needed." 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel we are a better team and we could have beaten Banning," Burgueno said. 
"When we were ahead the team started arguing against one another and that hurt 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss marked the Roughriders' third in championship play. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt fell to Granada Hills, 71-68, in the 1964 City Championship, and 
lost to Manual Arts four years later, 71-70. 
</P>
<P>
 Records: Roosevelt 14-12; Banning 19-11

THE ROOTS OF REBELLION ; THE CURRENT LAND REVOLT IN SOUTHERN MEXICO INVOLVES A 
MYSTERIOUS GUERRILLA ARMY, A DIVIDED CHURCH AND A NERVOUS GOVERNMENT. A JOURNEY 
ON THE REBELS' ROAD IN CHIAPAS. 
</P>

<P>
 Two days after an uneasy cease-fire began, tension gripped Las Margaritas, a 
usually tranquil coffee and ranching center 25 miles north of the Guatemalan 
border. Government soldiers eyed all movement warily, emptying vehicles and 
patting down men for arms. Hundreds of dazed refugees wandered through the neat 
zocalo, or central plaza, their next destination unknown. Officials were 
overwhelmed, lacking food, blankets and other necessities for the evacuees; 
some were housed in a hall where a mural of Emiliano Zapata, the revolutionary 
icon, presided over their troubled repose. War had come to this drowsy place, 
and no one quite knew what to make of it. "We don't know if we'll ever go home 
again," lamented Roselia Mendez, a shop owner whose hamlet was in the battle 
zone. "What will become of us? " 
</P>
<P>
 The lives of most everyone in Chiapas, Mexico's southernmost state, had been 
abruptly jarred. In a stunning New Year's Day offensive, a scruffy peasant army 
of perhaps 2,000 fighters launched a surprise attack and caught security forces 
off guard, ultimately seizing three major towns, including Las Margaritas, and 
the city of San Cristobal de las Casas. The rebels invoked the legendary name 
of Zapata, whose cry of Tierra y Libertad! stoked the Mexican Revolution of 
1910-17. The insurgents, their show of force accomplished, had since retreated 
to their strongholds in the Lacandon forest and environs. 
</P>
<P>
 For 10 days, the army had mounted a bloody offensive against the retreating 
rebels, sweeping through villages and arresting scores of peasants, most of 
whom protested their innocence. Helicopter gunships launched rockets and 
sprayed machine-gun fire on rural enclaves. A column of some 2,000 troops, 
backed by tanks and aircraft, had moved through Las Margaritas, intent on 
delivering a deathblow to rebel bastions in the jungle beyond. Official 
estimates put the death toll at about 100, though many believe it to be much 
higher -- the evidence is concealed in common graves throughout the region. The 
Mexican army, it appeared, was emulating the scorched-earth tactics so popular 
among nearby Central American regimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't understand why this happened," said Manuel Sanchez Perez, a 
65-year-old grandfather from San Antonio de Los Banos, a pine-shrouded Tzotzil 
Indian village in the hills above San Cristobal de las Casas. Speaking in front 
of his palm-roofed adobe hut, Sanchez gestured toward his adjoining cornfield, 
now seared black from bombing. But crops were not his only loss: Governmetn 
troops, he said, had taken away his son; he hadn't heard from him since. "The 
soldiers say there are bad people around," the disbelieving man explained in 
broken Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 But as national and international condemnation of military abuses arose, the 
Mexican government opted for conciliation, at least for now. A tense cease-fire 
took hold on Jan. 12 and the army beat a hasty retreat. authorities announced 
that they would negotiate with the guerrillas who presented a long list of 
grievances -- economic, social and political. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebel offensive -- Mexico's most serious insurgency in two decades -- 
shocked a nation whose leaders prided themselves on political stability and 
their unwavering march to modernity. Some say the revolt triggered Mexico's 
gravest social crisis since the Revolution. Yet relatively little was known 
about the rebels, their roots, the underlying upsets that had led an army of 
Mayan peasants to take go to war with rifles and machetes. The clues were to be 
found in the hardscrabble mountain and jungle villages where this insurgency 
was born and nurtured. 
</P>
<P>
 Past the final army checkpoint, heading northeast from Las Margaritas toward 
the guerrilla heartland, there was scarcely anyone on the gravel road. Most 
homes were abandoned. Deep potholes remained where the retreating rebels had 
gouged out trenches, attempting to slow the pursuing troops. Military debris -- 
Tootsie Roll wrappers, foil packaging of Made in U.S.A. rations -- littered 
former army campsites along this principal route to the the Lacandon region. 
Spray-painted black graffiti on a wall demanded: "Stop evictions of indigenous 
communities." The plea echoed the many long-ignored cries that had spurred this 
conflict -- the latest chapter in a bitter, centuries-long tradition of Indian 
revolts in Chiapas, one of Mexico's states. Woven into the dense social fabric 
of the state are violent land feuds and forced relocations of villagers -- 
usually at the bidding of cattlemen, political bosses or religious rivals 
responding to fierce tensions between the Catholic Establishment and Protestant 
evangelists. 
</P>
<P>
 Americas Watch, the human rights group, noted dryly about Chiapas in a 1990 
report: "Evictions are frequently accompanied by warrantless arrests of large 
numbers of community members, often on trumped-up charges, and without regard 
for what will become of the persons being evicted." Though home to only 3 1/2 
million people in a nation of 92 million, Chiapas accounts for more than a 
quarter of land disputes pending before Mexico's notoriously corrupt agrarian 
reform ministry. Police, soldiers and landowners' private militias ruthlessly 
enforce the will of cattle barons and other powerful interests -- not 
infrequently including drug traffickers. As Mexico hurtles toward the 
millennium, Chiapas is mired somewhere in a feudal past. 
</P>
<P>
 As the gravel road ascended into the pine forests, the parched, rocky 
landscape of Las Margaritas yielded to a cooler environment. In the valleys 
below lay expansive fincas (estates), now mostly gone to ruin amid an 
intractable slump in coffee prices. This was the domain of the Castellanos 
clan, old-style hacendados who, for generations, counted on the Tojolabal 
Indians -- descendants of the Mayas, like all the state's dozen or so 
indigenous groups -- to provide cheap and plentiful labor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Castellanos legacy became a kind of metaphor for the entire uprising. The 
rebels had entered a nearby family ranch and kidnaped Absalon Castellanos 
Dominguez, a 70-year-old retired general and stalwart of the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has ruled Mexico for more than six decades. 
Castellanos had earned a singularly brutal reputation as an enforcer for the 
landed gentry who had long treated the state as their personal finca. Despite 
post-revolutionary bans on amassing properties, the wealthy, critics say, 
retained and expanded their vast holdings through disguised ownership. Zapata's 
revolution, which radiated from the north, never made it this far south. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, Gen. Castellanos' troops were accused of massacring more than a dozen 
Tzeltal Indians who had sought restitution of their lands. Two years later, the 
PRI bestowed upon el general its gubernatorial nod, ensuring his election in a 
state where 90% of ballots are routinely cast for the ruling bloc. When 11 
Tzotzil Indians were killed in a land dispute during Castellanos' first year in 
office, the ex-general vowed: "We will take the pertinent measures" -- a 
refrain repeated after subsequent, equally unfulfilled demands for justice. 
</P>
<P>
 In abducting Castellanos, the rebels extracted a measure of retribution, 
convicting him of sundry crimes: "violation of Indians' human rights, robbery, 
evictions, kidnaping, corruption and murder." He was sentenced to "earn his 
bread" during a life term of hard labor among indigenous communities. (After 
six weeks in captivity, he was freed in exchange for the release of suspected 
rebels.) 
</P>
<P>
 Clinging to a steep mountainside rising from the tropical lowlands below was 
the near-abandoned village of El Nuevo Momon, a community of about 100 families 
housed in wood and mud-brick homes amid pine and banana trees. A cluster of a 
half-dozen unarmed lookouts took note of everyone's comings and goings; many 
rebels had traded in their red bandannas and olive khakis for less conspicuous 
garb. White flags sprang from still-inhabited dwellings. The tense cease-fire 
was holding, but revolutionary passions were high. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our parents, our grandparents, suffered for years working for the Castellanos 
hacendados, " said Jorge Vazquez, 36, a slim, severe peasant who spoke of his 
forefathers' humiliations as though the events were recent. He told a story 
oft-repeated here: Almost half a century ago, the Castellanos family promised 
more than 7,000 acres to peasants in exchange for clearing a jungle tract and 
establishing a new sugar cane plantation. The cane was soon plentiful -- but 
the people ended up with a fraction of the pledged property. When residents 
protested, pistoleros burned their homes and threatened them with worse. Today, 
mountains and private estates hemmed in the area's fast-growing families. "Now 
there is no place for us," said Vazquez. "Our people were fooled, deceived." 
Such anguish -- here and duplicated in scores of other rural communities -- 
helped shape the uprising of the Zapatista National Liberation Army, whose 
Spanish acronym, EZLN, is now part of the national lexicon. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels' demands for justice -- both economic and political -- have 
awakened long-suppressed grievances nationwide, crystallizing peasant and even 
urban frustration, and exposing the failure of President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari's much-touted anti-poverty initiative, Solidarity. The uprising has 
altered Mexico's economic and political landscape virtually overnight, just 
months before August's presidential elections test the ruling party's hegemony. 
And the disturbing martial images from the south shattered the president's 
finely crafted vision of a nation poised on the cusp of modernity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything changed overnight," wrote Elena Poniatowska in the Mexico City 
daily La Jornada. "In 1994 we woke up in a new country, a country where we have 
to live in a different way, in confusion, sadness, anxiety, desperation, bursts 
of machine-gun fire, la guerrilla ." 
</P>
<P>
 It was by design that the rebellion exploded on Jan. 1, the day the North 
American Free Trade Agreement -- the centerpiece of Salinas' economic blueprint 
-- kicked into place. Campesinos in the south and elsewhere never shared the 
NAFTA euphoria evident in the industrial hubs of northern and central Mexico. 
Small farmers feared that cheap, mass-produced U.S. foodstuffs would overwhelm 
their meager production of corn and beans. Already, critics said, the Salinas 
administration had undermined the hallowed ejido system -- a post-revolutionary 
form of quasi-communal ownership -- by allowing peasants to lease out their 
tracts, thereby encouraging U.S.-style agribusiness and new latifundios , the 
vast private holdings outlawed by the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, the Mayans of Chiapas can be said to have risen up in rejection of 
global markets, privatization, a New World Order and what they view as its 
corollaries: ever-more concentrated wealth, destruction of indigenous peoples, 
theft of their lands. "TODAY WE SAY ENOUGH!" the rebels proclaimed in their 
Declaration of War, emblazoned with the familiar mustachioed image of Zapata. 
</P>
<P>
 Monsignor Samuel Ruiz Garcia, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, was 
holding forth to the press about injustice. The cease-fire had not yet been 
declared; outside his residence, tanks rumbled down the narrow streets of the 
quaint colonial city, long popular with backpackers and exotica-seeking 
tourists -- a place where cappuccino machines coexist seamlessly with Indian 
merchants. Now, edgy troops toting M-16s and the not-too-distant sound of army 
shelling jarred the town's habitual serenity. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has happened here cannot be comprehended without understanding the 
social context," the baldish, bespectacled Don Samuel intoned in his signature 
baritone. "Of course we condemn violence . . . but we recognize that a great 
injustice has been done to our indigenous communities." The state's great 
natural resources -- land, water, petroleum, hydroelectric power -- are 
concentrated in few hands, the bishop noted, leaving much of the population 
impoverished, illiterate and lacking electricity and running water. "Time has 
stood still" in Chiapas, Ruiz declared during an interview, shortly before 
celebrating a wedding at the cathedral. "It appears like a historic 
anachronism." 
</P>
<P>
 In his 34 years as bishop, this native of central Mexico has mastered four 
indigenous languages and earned a reputation among Mayans as a tatic , or 
honored one, for his efforts on their behalf. Taking his cue from reformist 
church doctrines, Ruiz, 69, has emerged as the modern-day heir of this 
diocese's most celebrated bishop, Bartolome de las Casas, the 16th-Century 
"Protector of the Indians" who denounced the Spanish Crown's abuse of the 
native population, enraging colonial viceroys. When Indians protested the 500th 
anniversary of the Spaniards' arrival by toppling a statue of San Cristobal's 
founding conquistador, the mayor was quick to blame Ruiz. Like Fray Bartolome, 
Don Samuel has never hesitated to censure the powerful or break ranks with 
Mexico's conservative church leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, in a pastoral letter sent to Rome, the bishop adopted the Indians' 
viewpoint: "More and more, the people feel the weight of scarcity, of 
unemployment, of injustice and growing misery. There is malnutrition and 
illness provoked by poverty. We don't have land to work to get our food. . . . 
The applications we make for land receive no response, and it's very expensive 
to buy; meanwhile there are some who have a lot of land and don't farm it, or 
use it for cattle." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican government is widely believed to have pressured the Vatican last 
year to oust the bishop, whom large landowners view as a renegade liberation 
theologian inciting a holy war. The church hierarchy appeared to be pushing 
Ruiz out last fall, demanding that he respond to reports of ecclesiastical 
misconduct, including Marxist analysis of social conditions. But scores of 
religious leaders, peasant organizers and human rights activists -- some of 
whom have nominated Ruiz for the Nobel Peace Prize -- rose to the defense of 
Don Samuel. The bishop, not about to abandon a life's work without a fight, 
denied the insinuations and hung on tenaciously. And he was here when the 
Zapatistas marched into San Cristobal, thrusting his social agenda into 
international prominence. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeling Mexican authorities, attempting to explain this astonishing turn of 
events, soon found a scapegoat: the Roman Catholic Church. The powerful 
Ministry of the Interior, which controls the nation's security apparatus and 
oversees elections, placed blame for the rebellion largely on catequistas. 
These lay Catholic workers, authorities contended, along with Central American 
revolutionaries and disenchanted leftists who have drifted here since the 
1970s, disseminated subversion in the troubled hinterlands, "This is not an 
Indian movement nor a peasant action," the ministry declared. Vicious stories 
were planted: Ruiz was the Zapatistas' "supreme commander," a mass-circulation 
weekly blared beneath a photograph of the bishop celebrating Mass, a crucifix 
in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the campaign against the Catholic Church and Bishop Ruiz 
backfired. Much of the effort was reportedly orchestrated from Mexico City by 
former Interior Secretary Patrocinio Gonzalez Blanco Garrido, the 
Cambridge-educated lawyer who had earlier succeeded Castellanos as governor of 
Chiapas. As governor, critics say, Gonzalez expanded on Castellanos' legacy of 
repression -- jailing priests, persecuting peasants and harassing human-rights 
workers. As Interior Minister, Gonzalez had always downplayed persistent rumors 
of a burgeoning guerrilla force in his home state. But the war exposed the 
inadequacies of his governance; the red-faced Gonzalez was soon forced to 
resign from his Cabinet position, as was Chiapas' governor, a Gonzalez protege. 
</P>
<P>
 An ashen President Salinas turned to his long-time confidante, Manuel Camacho 
Solis, ex-mayor of Mexico City, whom he named as "Commissioner of Peace and 
Reconciliation" in Chiapas. For Camacho, the high-profile appointment amounted 
to a stunning turnaround. His career seemed to have come asunder in November, 
when Salinas passed him over for the ruling-party's presidential nod and 
instead named his chief rival, Social Development Secretary Luis Donaldo 
Colosio Murrieta. 
</P>
<P>
 Camacho's forte has long been negotiation and compromise -- skills that don't 
endear him to ruling-party apparatchiks, who fear he is too cozy with the 
leftist opposition. Pointedly, Camacho has chosen the path of dialogue with the 
Zapatistas. Amid a cease-fire and army retreat, the presidential envoy promptly 
recognized the "grave conditions" of poverty and racism that afflict the Indian 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a grave error to convert the Church into a public enemy," Camacho 
told reporters after arriving in Chiapas, Bishop Ruiz, the official mediator, 
by his side. "I say with clarity that the bishop is a friend of peace and an 
important factor in advancing the process that begins today." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiapas Mayans weren't the first rebels to hoist Zapata's banner anew. In 
the '60s, authorities crushed the storied rebellion of Ruben Jaramillo, who, in 
Zapata's home state of Morelos, took up the cause of los de abajo, the rural 
underclass. Later, two now-legendary schoolteachers, Lucio Cabanas and Genaro 
Vazquez Rojas, went underground in western Guerrero state, where conditions of 
poverty resemble those in Chiapas. Hundreds died or disappeared and entire 
villages were uprooted as part of a "dirty war" against guerrillas in Guerrero 
and elsewhere during the 1970s. Those historical antecedents, however, unfolded 
against a markedly different backdrop. Today, internal and international 
pressures have forced Mexico's leaders to pay some lip service to 
long-suppressed demands for democratic reform. And scrappy independent 
newspapers and magazines are now quick to report military abuses in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 The EZLN movement took shape deep inside the remote Lacandon forest, helped by 
the rugged terrain, lack of official presence and existence of numerous 
independent campesino groups that had sprung up here since the 1970s. The 
peasant organizations provided both recruits and a ready-made organizing 
network. How the rebels financed their activities and obtained guns and other 
equipment for thousands of troops remains an open question. The Zapatistas say 
all funds came from peasant sources, but there opponents speculate that 
kidnapings of rich Mexicans and other crimes bankrolled the rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Zapatistas operated in secrecy, many believe that authorities knew 
that an insurgency was germinating in the bush, although officials likely 
underestimated the threat. For reasons that remain obscure -- some see a 
disinclination to upset delicate free-trade talks -- no concerted enforcement 
operation was launched, even after the military stumbled upon a rebel training 
encampment near the town of Ocosingo last May. Instead, Mexico City funneled 
millions in anti-poverty funds to Chiapas, hopeful of buying off discontent; 
the federal largess enriched the political bosses and their cronies, but seldom 
trickled down to the peasants. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire Lacandon region has long been a caldron of unrest. Early in this 
century, timbermen kept Indian loggers in chains to ensure that they would not 
flee the brutal conditions in the mahogany camps. Years later, authorities 
pushed the losers in the state's chronic land wars into the long-neglected 
area, ever-farther from sight and mind. In recent decades, hundreds of 
thousands of homesteaders, mostly Indian peasants from the highlands, have 
staked out collective claims here, joining loggers, ranchers and, later, drug 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
 As the population swelled, the native Lacandon Indians were soon a tiny 
minority facing near-extinction. Intensively farmed tracts lost their fertility 
and there was less room to expand. Ownership claims were often ill-defined; 
inevitably, corrupt officials sided with ranchers and other influential 
overseers in property battles. The government's decision in the 1970s to create 
a vast jungle preserve severely constricted further settlement; subsequent bans 
on tree-felling narrowed employment possibilities. And the collapse of coffee 
prices in 1989 pushed people toward desperation. Finally, Mexico City's 
enfeebling of ejido safeguards and the prospect of free trade apparently 
prompted many to take up armed rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to tensions, tens of thousands of Guatemalan refugees arrived in 
Chiapas during the 1980s, fleeing brutal repression and a guerrilla war in 
their adjoining homeland. The Guatemalans, themselves Indians who often speak 
little Spanish, have watched developments with trepidation. On an isolated path 
near Poza Rica, a major refugee center in the Lacandon region, two apprehensive 
Kanjobal Indians from Guatemala were quick to disassociate themselves from the 
rebellious goings-on. "We're not Zapatistas," one of the men offered, 
unsolicited. Their machetes were for cutting corn and coffee, he pointed out, 
not for warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond Poza Rica, an eerie sense of desertion had overtaken the zone; most 
residents had fled. Those left behind were disposing of animals at giveaway 
prices. Horses, chickens, cows and other beasts ran wild; dogs howled in vain, 
mourning their departed masters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can understand people's fears, but I cannot condone leaving one's animals 
to the elements like this," said Luis Arturo Maldonado, former president of the 
cattlemen's association in Las Margaritas. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Luis, as he is known, has resisted the exodus of his fellow ranchers from 
Zapatista territory. Unlike most cattlemen, Maldonado, 36, is well-respected by 
area peasants. Rejecting the imperious stance of his colleagues, Maldonado has 
intervened with agrarian authorities on behalf of nearby ejidos and has long 
ferried campesinos and their goods in his battered, 20-year-old truck. He 
denounced the government with a vehemence matching that of the Zapatistas. For 
years, he noted, politicians have vowed to pave the main road to the nearest 
city, Comitan de Dominguez, now five hours away on a treacherous dirt route. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all tired of promises from the government," said Maldonado, seated on 
his front porch during a light rain, gazing toward the lush mountains beyond. 
For years, he suspected that radicals -- encouraged by missionary priests -- 
had organized paramilitary training deep in the forest. While virulently 
opposed to the rebellion, the rancher sympathizes with the fight against a 
government that deceived and exploited its poorest citizens, seldom delivering 
on its promises. "Officials always help the biggest cattlemen," said Maldonado, 
who, with about 210 acres and 80 head of cattle, is a relative small-timer. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike fellow ranchers who have threatened to launch a private war to recoup 
their lands, Maldonado prefers accommodation (though he does carry a pistol 
these days). If the guerrillas demand one of his herd as a "war tax," he plans 
to comply. "I'm afraid we'll have to get used to la guerrilla here," Maldonado 
said. "If anything good comes of this disaster," he added, "I hope that someone 
will finally do something about the terrible, paralyzing corruption that has 
plagued this country." 
</P>
<P>
 From Maldonado's ranch, A two-hour horseback ride on narrow, muddy mountain 
tracks, through streams and down precipitous drops, leads to Caracol, a village 
identified in government documents as a rebel training and communications 
center. Recent visitors were met on the path by men in their late teens and 
20s, dressed in tattered civilian clothes and rubber boots. They were unarmed 
except for machetes, but some wore the hand-stitched green caps of Zapatista 
fighters. Suspicious, they nonetheless sat down to talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would we go to war if we had alternatives?" asked the apparent leader, 
perhaps 25, who seemed genuinely tormented by recent events. "Would we go to 
war if we could have decent clothes, not these rags that we wear? If we had a 
proper education for our children?" He was soon virtually shouting. "If we had 
a clinic and people didn't have to die because of a lack of care, like our 
parents and grandparents did? If we had our land. . . . That's why there's a 
war. . . . Maybe now, finally, they'll listen to us." 
</P>
<P>
 He and others recounted their ejido's troubled history: For three generations, 
the men said, they and their Tojolabal ancestors -- who founded the settlement 
-- fought in vain to legalize their property claims. Today, they remain 
squatters in the eyes of the law. Villagers had made numerous trips to Las 
Margaritas and the state capital and hosted agrarian functionaries -- even 
bribed them, hoping the plots would finally be theirs. "We sold all our animals 
to give them money, and we were left with nothing!" another man exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 They spoke of other frustrations: government promises of better roads, a 
clinic and school that never materialized. Teachers seldom arrived; those who 
did left after a few weeks. "Any of us who know how to read learned on our own 
-- not because of any help from the government," noted the leader, who, like 
the others, declined to give his name. "What chance do our children have? They 
are condemned to ignorance, like we were." 
</P>
<P>
 Medical care is two hours away on horseback. "The only time they attend to us 
quickly is when we ask about family planning," the leader noted with a caustic 
laugh. "Then they're happy to help us. They want us to be fewer." 
</P>
<P>
 After 90 minutes of angry conversation on the roadside, they were asked if 
they were part of the Zapatista column that took the town of Las Margaritas. 
"All I can say," responded the spokesman, "is that our hearts are with these 
fighters. We see that there is finally a battle for justice in our country, and 
we support that fight. We feel this is long overdue. If someone doesn't do 
something now, there will never be a change in this place." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about Emiliano Zapata, the men shook their heads. They had heard of the 
man, but didn't know much about him. 
</P>
<P>
 From their jungle hide-the Zapatista leadership has successfully managed to 
convey its viewpoints via communiques secreted to the eager press corps in San 
Cristobal. Most comunicados are the handiwork of sub-comandante Marcos, who 
rapidly acquired a kind of cult cachet: a latter-day Che Guevara in a ski mask. 
He has penned witty, brash and detailed correspondence, spicing political dogma 
with references to films, soap operas and books. Although he acknowledged that 
the Zapatistas cannot defeat the army in a military faceoff, Marcos vanquished 
the government on the propaganda front. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcos appealed to U.S. audiences to cut off aid to Mexico's "dictatorial 
government." Elaborating on the rebels' calls for land reform and social 
justice, he demanded the resignation of an "illegitimate" President Salinas and 
the formation of a transition government to guarantee free elections -- 
explicitly linking democratic reform with an economic restructuring. "In 
summary," Marcos wrote, "we want peace with dignity and justice."  
</P>
<P>
 The rebellion, he asserted, was 10 years in the making, and emerged largely as 
a function of self-defense against ranchers' hired militias. During this 
formative decade, Marcos added, the rebels had unsuccessfully pursued peaceful 
avenues toward change -- while, he charged, thousands of Indians died of 
curable diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economic and social plans of the federal, state and municipal governments 
. . . are limited to giving us handouts during election time," Marcos thundered 
in another letter. "But the charity does not help for more than one moment. . . 
. If we die now, it won't be with shame but rather with dignity, like our 
ancestors." 
</P>
<P>
 The light-skinned Marcos says he is of mixed-race, like most Mexicans -- and 
Zapata himself. Conversant in history, politics and current events, Marcos was 
evidently one of the radical activists who came here from northern and central 
Mexico during the 1970s and '80s seeking a cause and a base, drawn by the 
region's upheaval and potential for organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zapatistas stress their indigenous origins. Their demands include some 
kind of autonomy for Mexico's Indians, who now account for less than 10% of the 
nation's population. Marcos, subordinate in the rebel hierarchy to a 
clandestine indigenous committee, assailed the perception of Indians as an 
"anthropological object, touristic curiosity, or part of a 'Jurassic Park.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels' ideology is still amorphous. But notably absent are the 
Marxist-Leninist rhetoric and yanqui- bashing that are pro forma in Latin 
American leftist tracts. Rather, the EZLN embraces a kind of peculiarly Mexican 
Indian nationalism, more closely related to Zapata's populist exhortations than 
the oratory of Marx and Mao. "They follow a very Mexican form of socialism," 
said Andres Aubry, a French anthropologist who has worked in the region for 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 In an extensive interview with Mexican reporters deep in the jungle, the 
poncho-clad Marcos -- sporting his trademark black ski mask, red bandanna and 
belts of scarlet shotgun shells -- returned to the rebellion's seminal 
preoccupation: la tierra . President Salinas' revision of constitutional 
safeguards protecting the ejido system and its guarantees of land to peasants 
in need, he told them, was a "powerful catalyst" for the events of Jan. 1. "The 
companeros say land is life, that if you don't have land you're dead, so why 
live?" Marcos explained. "Better to fight and to die fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 FROM THE RAIN FOREST TO the highlands, la tierra is indisputably the central 
preoccupation in the Chiapas countryside. "There is no more land for our sons," 
said Olivio Hernandez, an 80-year-old great-grandfather who pondered the matter 
outside his home of wooden slats in El Nuevo Momon, a white flag rising from 
the roof. "Our sons want to work, not fight. Our people have always worked the 
land." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, remaining residents gathered in front of Nuevo Momon's looted 
government store. Belisario Jimenez Lopez, a 40-year-old agricultural union 
leader from the nearby ejido of Cruz del Rosario, was urging them not to 
abandon their lots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our land is not allowed to grow, but of course our families do," said 
Jimenez, a father of eight who represents the Union of Ejidos of the Forest, 
one of the region's many independent organizations. Most of his fellow 
unionists resisted Zapatista entreaties to join the armed conflict, Jimenez 
said, because they opposed violence. Nonetheless, like others here, he 
sympathized with the rebels' complaints. "The men in our village who went with 
the Zapatistas are the ones who have the most severe land problems. It's as 
simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
 An allied unionist, Mario Hernandez Juarez, also called the Zapatistas' cause 
a just one, while disapproving of violence. "I must admit a certain amount of 
admiration," he noted as he recounted the events of Dec. 31, when columns of 
Zapatistas arrived here in hijacked trucks, bound for Las Margaritas. "These 
are campesinos like us, ready to die and take a stand for what they believe 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with uncertainty and warfare gripping the valley, the 24-year-old father 
of three was hopeful that something good would arise from the tumult. "We want 
peace and tranquillity," Hernandez said. "But this time, officials should be 
forced to keep whatever promises they make. The government cannot be allowed to 
break their promises this time."

 Sweet spring is upon us, a time of new life and raw earth and a fresh start 
for growing things. The best part, for the gardener, may come before the spade 
hits dirt, when a plot of land is full of limitless possibilities. Just how 
limitless is evident here, where we've asked some of Southern California's best 
garden-makers to take the blank canvas of spring and paint a fantasy garden for 
the season. On a Stroll 
</P>
<P>
 The gardens of Los Angeles landscape designer Mia Lehrer of Lehrer Architects 
tend toward a modernist simplicity. Nevertheless, her spring fantasy is an 
oasis of explosive blooms and secret sitting spots. It begins with a gazebo 
engulfed in wisteria. From there, it wanders down a path bordered by a hedge of 
flowers: a 3-by-6-foot metal frame thatched and seeded with alyssum, 
strawberries and poppies. The walk ends in a bosque of flowering peach trees 
and a romantic bench flanked by potted California oranges. Rill Life 
</P>
<P>
 Venice garden artist Jay Griffith has raised some eyebrows with his giant 
plant towers and fountains spilling crystal pendants into glass "pools." Here 
he opts for updated classicism, raiding a Persian court for a hedge, gate, 
water rill and pool. More important than his landscape's plants are its 
interlocking color planes: lawn paired with purple tradescantia,Scotch moss 
with flame gazania. Extravagant props fool the eye -- a rusted-metal palm tree, 
topiary orbs that bloom with vines. Griffith plays with the idea of a garden, 
paring it down to its offbeat essence. Way to Grow 
</P>
<P>
 Artichokes, cabbages and herbs deck the California kitchen plot of Nancy 
Goslee Power, a Santa Monica garden designer known for elegant but livable 
outdoor rooms. This one is a walled Eden with a mountain view in which to mix 
the edible and the sublime. Lavender sprays crown raised beds full of 
Mediterranean culinary favorites: radicchio, asparagus, rapini, sage and 
rosemary. Espaliered lemon trees and sweet peas climb sun-warmed walls, a stone 
seat invites lounging and a fountain offers water music and a basin for washing 
vegetables. Moody Views 
</P>
<P>
 A trio of landscapes reflect the season's mood for Katherine Spitz of 
Katherine Spitz Associates, a Marina del Rey design firm. Spitz's best-known 
gardens often send their visitors on metaphorical journeys. These three, like 
stage sets for a dream, suggest vignettes of the psyche that might be entered 
and explored. One (below), ablaze with lion's tail, mixed salvias and 
bougainvilleas, speaks of passion wild enough to carry off the wanderer. The 
second (bottom), subdued in tone and spiked with succulents, conveys restraint 
and apprehension. The third (top right) is a dreamer's garden with a formal 
structure of rooms that evoke a panoply of emotions -- tranquillity, romance 
and nostalgia. Court Order 
</P>
<P>
 Garden designer Thomas Cox of Santa Monica-based Thomas Batcheller Cox 
Associates often looks to the Mediterranean courtyard as an inspiration for his 
own creations. Here, using minimal elements -- walls, tree, fountain, chairs 
and concrete pavers -- he has conjured up a city court with all the luxuries of 
grander space. Wisteria, Dutch bulbs and Japanese maple capture the burgeoning 
of spring. A glimpse of bamboo through a grilled window suggests the world 
beyond, while Corsican mint among the paving stones sweetens the air within. 
Force of Habitat 
</P>
<P>
 Out of her memories of the recent Malibu fire (see photo insets), Pamela 
Burton of Santa Monica-based Pamela Burton & Co. conjures a landscape of 
rebirth. Burton's trademark is a garden that tells a story, and in this one, 
nature rises from the flames. In an earthen room, blackened root crowns spout 
sumac leaves and turquoise flesh erupts from yucca stumps. Aligned so that the 
spring sun rises at its entrance, the space is guarded by a pair of Canary 
Island date palms -- scorched but thriving -- and encircled by a blooming 
Valencia orange grove to show the contrast between our cultivation of the earth 
and its cultivation of itself. Park Place 
</P>
<P>
 Eucalyptus on a gravel ground, a quiet bench, the clean slice of a reflecting 
pool, spring bulbs, sun -- all join forces in this simple vision by Mark Rios 
of Rios Associates, a Los Angeles architecture and landscape architecture firm 
known for sophisticated, contemporary gardens. Pictured in plan, perspective 
and computer-animated detail, Rios' grove is full of fragrance and light, 
carpeted in leaf litter and washed by the dazzle of glass ornaments in the 
trees. Spilling water and rustling leaves add sound. Never picked up, never cut 
back, the garden is changeless except in one respect: Its flowers vary with the 
seasons.

SHALLOW WATERS; GOOD INTENTIONS AND FRESH INGREDIENTS PAVE THE WAY TO 
AMBIVALENT DINING

 If there's one thing all great cooks seem to have in common these days, it's 
the belief that the very best cooking is based on first-rate ingredients. This 
is something California's gastronomic gurus have been preaching for years. And 
it does hold true -- as far as the kitchen door. At Clearwater Cafe, a new 
environmentally sensitive restaurant in Pasadena's Old Town, the raw materials 
are among the best in the land, which makes what comes out of the kitchen a 
little baffling. 
</P>
<P>
 A blackboard out front lists the provenance of ingredients procured for that 
day's menu. It includes Pacific sweetwater oysters and Manila clams from Hog 
Island Oysters Farms in Tomales Bay, organic rice from Lundberg Family Farms 
and fresh-cut lettuces and herbs from Kenter Canyon Farms, all of which you can 
read about in the restaurant's newsletter. Most of the produce is organic and 
comes from small California farms that practice sustainable agriculture. Fish 
is purchased whole, from local purveyors whenever possible, and does not 
include fish caught in gill nets in the ocean or threatened species such as 
shark. And if anyone wants to know more, a three-ring binder at the front desk 
bursts at the seams with a detailed nutritional analysis of each dish on the 
menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearwater is basically a hip natural-foods restaurant with enough choices on 
the menu so that strict vegans, vegetarians, people on low-fat diets and 
vegetable and seafood lovers can all sit down together in a setting that looks 
like a million bucks -- which is exactly what Jeff and Sam King of University 
Restaurant Group, which also owns the Water Grill downtown, spent on it. The 
budget shows in fine details like the whimsical copper lamps and the 
beautifully crafted booths and tables. Metal cut-out fish dart in and out of 
the copper-ribboned sea that runs along the staircase.  
</P>
<P>
 The gardener in me relishes the produce displayed like so many treasures from 
near and far. Inside the door is a flat of closely packed sunflower sprouts so 
green, it's as if you're seeing the color for the first time. Wooden crates 
spill golden citrus and fragrant melons. Exotic bananas and baskets of sweet 
dumpling squash are piled outside the kitchen.  
</P>
<P>
 It's pleasant to sit at the long wood-and-zinc bar sipping a glass of Bosc 
pear juice or the Day-Glo orange eight-vegetable drink. You can also order a 
shot of wheat grass, plain or spiked with garlic or ginger, as an aperitif. "We 
all take a shot when we start our shifts," confesses the bartender. The taste? 
Like drinking a lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 But you know a kitchen is in trouble when the best dishes are those that 
require little cooking skill. At Clearwater, that means superb oysters on the 
half shell served with grated fresh horseradish or the steamed Hog Island clams 
or Prince Edward Island mussels with white wine and garlic. You can't go wrong 
with salads like the mixed sprout salad with a nice toasted sesame dressing or 
the medley of springy seaweeds. For a main course, choose the simply steamed 
Maine lobster with drawn butter, fresh corn and boiled potatoes. Beware the 
more complicated dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Soups come by the cup, pint or quart, but who could get through a pint of the 
insipid 15-vegetables-and-bean soup? The quart of cioppino doesn't stint on the 
seafood, but its broth is so full of chunks of tomato it could easily stand in 
for a pasta sauce. The retro-garlic bread with it is soaked in oil. The 
chowder, happily crowded with plump meaty clams and potatoes, leans the other 
way: The taste of the broth is faint. That's just for starters. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't take a highly trained chef to make a decent crab Louie salad. This 
Louie looks as if it was cut up by someone wielding a knife for the first time. 
And could someone please explain the logic of dressing it with "eggless" 
Thousand Island dressing when the salad includes hard-boiled egg? You can 
hardly find the extra-virgin olive oil on the sliced Southern California citrus 
salad of pomelos, tangerines and blood oranges. Chilean sea bass (called 
Patagonian toothfish here) with delicious red chard arrives perfectly cooked, 
but the wine sauce has been reduced to the consistency of crude oil. And 
pecan-coated catfish has been burned in places; even worse, the coating has a 
moldy taste.  
</P>
<P>
 On two occasions the crisp, ungreasy fries are so loaded with salt, no one at 
my table can eat them. (Our earnest young waiter did offer to replace them.) 
Same problem with the corn-studded creamy polenta that accompanies the grilled 
Coronado yellowtail and earthy sauteed spinach one night. The 
organic-brown-rice risotto, laden with calamari, sweet corn and asparagus, has 
a wonderful texture and crunch, but goes uneaten. The fault? An overdose of 
salt.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the appealing menu descriptions, the desserts seem straight out of the 
Dark Ages of hippie baking. Every one I sample is cloyingly sweet and served in 
enormous portions. When the young manager inquires if it's our first time at 
Clearwater, he coyly admonishes us, "You know, you can't leave until you finish 
the desserts!" This was asking the impossible.  
</P>
<P>
 As we leave, I happen to overhear one woman lament to another: "I'm so 
disappointed. I'm a vegetarian. Why can't they cook food that we like?" That is 
exactly the question. And the reason the two are soon exchanging addresses of 
other vegetarian and health food restaurants. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It may not be a trend yet, but Clearwater Cafe has the first wine list I have 
seen with a section devoted to wines made from organically farmed grapes, which 
are grown without pesticides, fungicides or chemical fertilizers. The five-wine 
category includes the two widest-selling organic wines from Fetzer Vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a changing list of micro-brewed beers on tap. Recently, it included 
Big Rock XO Lager and Royal Coachman Dry Ale, both from Canada; Oregon Honey 
Beer and Widmer Hefeweizen, an unfiltered wheat beer, both from Portland; St. 
Rogue Red, a hearty brew from Newport, Ore., and Grant's Scottish Ale from 
Yakima, Wash. All brews may be ordered by the pint or 12-ounce glass.  
</P>
<P>
 The all-West Coast wine list, heavy on the whites because of the seafood 
emphasis, has a number of good values, including 1991 Benziger Fume Blanc, $19; 
1992 Frog's Leap Sauvignon, $18; 1991 Navarro Gewurztraminer, $18, and 1991 
Chateau St. Jean Chardonnay, $19. Dan Berger

HIGH RISKS INVOLVED IN OWNER FINANCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In her article "Advantages and Drawbacks of Seller Financing" (Jan. 23) Dian 
Hymer should have warned sellers that there are high risks involved in owner 
financing. Consider our situation: 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991 we sold our home so we could pull out our equity and invest it for the 
future of our young handicapped son. 
</P>
<P>
 We felt very fortunate that our buyers were very financially qualified. We 
felt that a couple making such fantastic salaries and with such spotless credit 
records would have no problems making their mortgage payments to us, and 
therefore we decided to carry back a substantial loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Then property values in this area fell about 20% and the buyers have 
discovered that they have no equity in the property. They decided to stop 
making the mortgage and tax payments. 
</P>
<P>
 To protect our investment, we are having to foreclose on the buyers, which is 
a long and expensive process. We have not been paid in four months and still 
must wait another two months before they are ousted from the property. 
</P>
<P>
 In the state of California, sellers who finance to buyers cannot sue 
defaulting buyers for "deficiency." To use our case as an example, this means 
that, even though our buyers are more than financially qualified to make the 
mortgage payments, if they choose not to pay, all we can do is foreclose to get 
our property back. It is not possible to recover foreclosure costs or any other 
loss through a civil suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Our advice to any seller considering owner financing is to see a qualified 
real estate attorney and get advice on the potential risks involved. We agree 
with Hymer's opinion that it is very easy for a seller to "scrutinize a buyer's 
financial status and credit report," but as in our case, how does one 
scrutinize a buyer's honesty, credibility and willingness to honor a contract.

 Jaipur is capital of the desert state of Rajasthan in northwestern India and 
one of that nation's most colorful cities. Inside the Old City's 270-year-old 
walls, the buildings are pink and orange -- in fact, Jaipur is called "the Pink 
City" -- and the streets are filled with donkeys, horses, cows, goats, monkeys 
and even elephants.On the other hand, the city's most beautiful building, the 
Rambagh Palace, is luminously white and the rooms are filled with fortunate 
souls paying as much as $500 a day to live like nabobs. Built by the maharajah 
Man Singh II in the late 1920s, the Rambagh was turned into a luxury hotel in 
1957. The luxury is real. Guests can stroll through the gardens in the cool of 
sunrise, sip Singapore slings on the terrace as musicians and jugglers perform 
and camel-drivers pass by, work out in the well-equipped gym, swim in the 
indoor pool with its stained-glass windows, sample excellent Indian and 
European food in the main dining room (called the Suvarna Mahal, or Golden 
Palace, for its gilded mirrors and thick golden brocade tapestries). My own 
$150-a-night suite was about 600 feet square -- so large it came with dual-zone 
air-conditioning -- and had a marble bathroom about three times the size of the 
average Indian house. More expensive suites are practically palaces of their 
own.

 Rambagh Palace, Bhawani Singh Road, Jaipur, telephone (91-141) 521-241;

SIDE TRIPS; TRAVELING COLORS

 The color schemes on airplanes, in hotels and in cruise ship cabins aren't 
accidental. Specialists select shades carefully -- using colors to add to a 
guest's feeling of well-being and relaxation.Here's how some prominent 
travel-related companies choose their hues: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Airlines: "We considered both red and blue for interior colors in our planes," 
says Andrea Butler, public relations spokeswoman for USAir, of its logo's 
colors. "Red is kind of an aggressive color and can bring out the worst in 
people. Blue was the logical choice. It has a more calming effect." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hotels: "Our color schemes are aimed more at (pleasing) women than men, 
because our surveys show that women notice colors and patterns in a room," says 
Betsy O'Rourke, who does public relations for Choice Hotels International, 
operators of the Comfort, Sleep, Rodeway and Clarion chains. The first three of 
these favor pastels and soft prints. At the Clarions, darker, more "masculine" 
colors are used because these hotels tend to attract business travelers -- 
still mostly men. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cruise ships: "We use light colors, such as blues and greens, to give a 
feeling of openness, light and space," says Soren Yran, a Miami-based designer 
who creates interiors for Norwegian Cruise Lines and others. "In the next five 
years, cruise ship cabins and other interiors will use more natural earth 
colors -- beige, sand, yellow, blue -- because people are more conscious about 
environmental issues." Kathleen Doheny

MAKING BABIES; THE BOOM IN THE INFERTILITY BUSINESS IS RAISING HOPES, AND 
INCREASING CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Nancy Wartik, Nancy Wartik, who lives in Brooklyn, N.Y., is a contributing 
editor for American Health magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his spotless embryology lab at the Center for Reproductive Medicine at 
Century City Hospital, David Hill is peering into the viewer of a 
formidable-looking microscope, trying to make a baby. On a monitor next to the 
scope is the vastly magnified image of a woman's egg -- smaller, in reality, 
than a tiny speck of dust -- and of the microscopic suction rod holding it in 
place. Right now, Hill's attention is on the semen sample next to the egg. With 
his right hand, he's manipulating controls that send a needle far finer than a 
hair chasing after what looks to be a batch of teeny, wriggling long-tailed 
polliwogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best sperm tend to go off to the edge and go around and around the drop 
like little race cars," Hill says as he hunts down a pack of them. "It's very 
fortuitous for embryologists." 
</P>
<P>
 When he's zeroed in on the sperm he wants, Hill draws them up into the needle 
by sucking on a rubber mouthpiece that's connected to a slender hose and 
clenched between his teeth -- an oddly low-tech note in this whole 
sophisticated operation. After he's drawn some 50 sperm into the needle, he 
moves it over to the egg and presses down against its translucent outer shell 
(the zona pellucida ). Under the pressure of the needle, the egg squashes in on 
itself alarmingly, like a beach ball poked with a stick. But as soon as Hill 
punctures the zona pellucida , deposits a fraction of the sperm and retracts 
the needle, the egg springs back into shape. Beneath its cloudy shell, the 
sperm buzz madly about like trapped insects. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure he's just completed is a subzonal insertion, usually known by 
its friendly acronym, SUZI. Eggs and sperm that Hill manipulate in this way 
can't, for one reason or another, achieve fertilization on their own. So he's 
helping them bypass the arduous trek to conception. The sperm-injected eggs 
(usually a total of seven or eight for each couple) go into an incubator and 
are maintained at body temperature for 14 to 18 hours. Depending on the number 
that make the leap to embryo status, about four of the best quality will be 
loaded into a catheter and inserted into the woman's womb. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't wait to come into the lab, open up the incubator and see whether any 
of our efforts have resulted in decent embryos," says Hill. "It's just like 
opening a little Christmas present. I never get tired of it." In Hill's 
sterilized lab, surrounded by the tools of his trade, it's easy to lose sight 
of what's actually happening. For couples who come to Century City, as to a 
fast-growing number of similar clinics around the country, these procedures 
represent a last chance to achieve a desire as old as human history: that of 
giving birth to a child. On behalf of these couples, Hill is waging a daily 
battle of technology against nature. And despite a swelling arsenal of 
controversial new techniques and procedures, nature usually wins. 
</P>
<P>
 THREE YEARS AGO, JOHN TAYLOR (this name and those of the other patients have 
been changed) got the call from his doctor, just before a weekend business trip 
to New Orleans. After months of trying unsuccessfully to conceive, John and his 
wife, Leslie, had sought medical help. Now they were awaiting results of his 
sperm test. The voice at the other end of the line had bad news. "The doctor 
told me I had absolutely no sperm," recalls Taylor, 36, a television lighting 
designer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two of us stood in the kitchen and bawled our eyes out. I was destroyed. 
I felt emasculated. I come from a large family, and the fact that I'd never be 
able to have my own children -- never, there wasn't a hope in hell -- was 
devastating." 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of his weekend trip, in a bizarre twist of events, Taylor returned 
to hear that there had been a mix-up at the lab, and he did have a sperm count. 
But it was low, the doctor warned him; pregnancy would still be problematic. 
"If the guy had been standing there, I'd have decked him for putting me through 
all that," he says. "But I was also pleased. At least he'd given us back some 
hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, $20,000 poorer and their insurance coverage for infertility exhausted, 
the Taylors wonder whether there was much point in those hopes being raised. 
Both partners have undergone surgery to correct reproductive-tract problems; 
each has tried fertility drugs. They've tried timed insemination, with John's 
sperm inserted directly into Leslie's uterus when ultrasound scanning showed 
she was ovulating. Twice they've attempted, and failed at, "test tube" 
conception at Century City. To cut costs on the pricey medication a woman takes 
during such attempts, they've journeyed to Tijuana to purchase their drugs at 
cut-rate prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Running the gantlet of these treatments has "put an incredible strain on our 
marriage," says Taylor. "Frankly, I'm surprised we're still together. In many 
aspects, our lives have been on hold with this thing for three years." 
</P>
<P>
 In a few months, the Taylors will return to Century City to try a new 
procedure developed in Belgium that Hill has recently begun working on. The 
ultimate refinement of existing sperm-injection methods, it involves shooting a 
single sperm directly into the heart of an egg and seems to produce higher 
fertilization rates than multiple-sperm procedures such as SUZI; the Belgian 
clinic that first used it is now claiming pregnancy rates of more than 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 This could be the Taylors' winning ticket in the baby lottery. But Leslie, 38, 
a small, jeans-clad TV director who sits curled on the sofa in their North 
Hollywood home, is tiring of the demands of the pregnancy chase. "I only want 
to try direct injection once," says Leslie. "John wants to try it twice. I'm 
emotionally and physically beyond it. I've been on hormone injections for three 
solid months; I feel fat and bloated and like I could cry at the drop of a hat. 
Why is it that we cannot conceive a child? Why?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It can make you feel guilty," says John. "You look back over your life, you 
say: 'I've always tried to be a decent person. Did I do something wrong? Is God 
trying to punish me? Was it my lifestyle?' " 
</P>
<P>
 He's not willing to give up, however, and his determination is carrying both 
of them. "All through this, we've had a willingness to fight, not to take the 
first defeat and say, 'OK, it's over,' " he says. "When you start something 
like this, you've got to finish. Otherwise you spend the rest of your life 
wondering 'What if?' I'm still not convinced we're finished." 
</P>
<P>
 To Leslie, he adds, "I won't ask for more than two tries. But you go in every 
time thinking, this is the time it's going to work." 
</P>
<P>
 More often than not, however, you'll be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 INSIDE THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES AT THE CENTURY CITY REPRODUCIVE clinic, 
which occupies part of a floor in this small private hospital, are homey 
touches: stuffed animals nesting on file cabinets, a sign that reads "Never 
give up!" On the outer walls hang photos of children conceived as a result of 
treatment here and letters from their grateful parents. There is praise for the 
"incredible staff" at Century City, and the word miracle shows up often. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, more than 300 couples come here seeking children. For many, it's a 
court of last appeal, after months or years of lower-tech efforts such as drugs 
or surgery have failed. In general, those who choose high-tech conception 
follow a similar regimen. A woman begins with daily injections of powerful 
hormone-regulating drugs to stimulate her ovaries to mature more eggs than the 
single one that normally matures each month. If the therapy succeeds, the crop 
of eggs -- about 10 on average but in some cases more than 30 -- is 
"harvested." While a patient is under local or general anesthesia, a doctor 
inserts a needle either vaginally or through an incision in the stomach to suck 
the eggs from her ovaries. 
</P>
<P>
 In regular in-vitro fertilization (IVF), eggs are then combined in a petri 
dish with the sperm sample, fresh or frozen, that a man has dutifully provided. 
In gamete intra-Fallopian transfer (GIFT), developed as a slightly more 
"natural" alternative to IVF -- eggs and sperm don't unite in glassware, but 
are inserted together into the Fallopian tubes. The resulting embryos are 
transferred into the uterus, the Fallopian tubes or, sometimes, both. At many 
IVF centers, extra embryos now can be frozen, meaning a woman doesn't have to 
go through the stressful process of an egg retrieval at each attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Louise Brown, the first baby conceived through IVF, was born in Britain in 
1978. Three years later, the first American high-tech baby was born at a 
Norfolk, Va., clinic. Since then, the infertility business in the United States 
has mushroomed into a $2-billion-a-year enterprise, much of its expansion 
spurred by the development of assisted reproductive technologies, including IVF 
and the many different methods it has spawned for manipulating eggs and sperm 
outside the body. It is, at best, an imperfect science -- expensive, 
unregulated and relatively untested, especially in the area of long-term 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
 But the market for reproductive technologies is sizable. According to the 
National Center for Health Statistics, about 2.3 million married American 
couples are infertile (meaning they haven't been able to conceive after a year 
or more of trying). For up to 15% of them, according to the American Fertility 
Society, high-tech approaches are considered the only hope. With the U.S. 
government disinclined to allocate research dollars to a politically touchy 
area such as reproductive technology, this country has lagged behind Australia 
and parts of Europe -- but not too far. There are now about 350 U.S. 
infertility clinics, including at least two multi-state chains; at least 45 
reproductive clinics that perform IVF and other assisted technologies are 
crowded into California alone. More than 33,000 
assisted-reproductive-technology procedures were initiated in 1991, the last 
year for which figures are available, up 30% from 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally used only to treat blocked tubes, assisted reproductive 
technologies are now applied to a range of female infertility problems, 
including endometriosis, ovulatory disorders and the catch-all condition of 
"unexplained infertility." More recently, researchers have zeroed in on male 
infertility. Women had long been accorded the lion's share of the blame when a 
marriage was barren, but when reproductive specialists peered closely into 
their petri dishes, they discovered that the man was wholly or partly 
responsible for a couple's problem 40% to 60% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 For some men, approaches that range from eschewing hot tubs to undergoing 
corrective surgery will do the trick. But others have sperm that are so few in 
number, sluggish, malformed or otherwise defective that doctors could do 
nothing but point them toward the nearest sperm bank -- until recently. In the 
late 1980s, embryologists found it was possible to aid recalcitrant sperm in 
fertilization by opening the egg's outer shell to give the sperm easier access. 
This type of "micromanipulation," known as partial zona dissection, was 
followed by SUZI. Then, in 1992, came the Belgians' encouraging announcement of 
intracytoplasmic sperm injection, or ICSI (pronounced ICK-see by those in the 
field), the no-nonsense technique in which a single sperm is propelled to the 
egg's center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's actually somewhat surprising the technique works," admits Jacques Cohen, 
scientific director of assisted reproduction at New York City's Cornell Medical 
Center and a pioneer in the development of micromanipulation. "We used to think 
there was a certain sequence of processes that was absolutely necessary before 
the sperm was able to fertilize the egg. Now we know that's not true; those 
processes can be completely surpassed." 
</P>
<P>
 As these dazzling technologies establish themselves as the wave of the future, 
troubling issues surround their use. Most conspicuous are the ethical dilemmas 
that seem to grab headlines weekly. There is much outrage at the idea of 
60-year-old women becoming mothers and apprehension that scientists might soon 
start using eggs from aborted fetuses to produce babies -- meaning that a child 
could have a biological mother who was never born. And last fall, two U.S. 
scientists "cloned" a human embryo, making an exact genetic copy of the 
origi-nal and raising the specter of an assembly-line baby-manufacturing 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the moment, these issues don't apply in clinical practice -- or apply 
to only a tiny handful of those who visit programs. (Realistically, not many 
60-year-old women crave new motherhood.) For most infertile couples, the 
considerations are more mundane: In 1991, only 15% of individual attempts at 
test-tube conception produced what's known in the field as a "take-home baby" 
-- with figures higher or lower depending on the procedure and the patient 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 If success rates are low, however, prices are not. A completed attempt (some 
women drop out early because they don't respond to initial hormone therapy) 
ranges from $8,000 to $13,000 or more. Lumped into the category of "luxury" 
treatments such as tummy-tucks or orthodontia, assisted reproductive 
technologies in many cases are not covered, or only minimally covered, by 
insurance. And there's no money-back guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
 In worst-case scenarios, patients run up huge tabs in repeated futile efforts 
to have a baby. "The door never, ever completely closes on an infertile 
couple," acknowledges Hill. "There's always the latest snazzy technique to 
rekindle hope. They can end up at the end of the line childless and financially 
depleted." 
</P>
<P>
 Contemplating this scenario, a small but vocal number of critics, several of 
them on Capitol Hill, have raised their voices in a growing chorus of 
complaint. Too often, they say, the assisted-reproductive-technology field is 
battening on emotional desperation. "The technology doesn't work," says Ann 
Pappert, who's working on a book to be titled "Cruel Promises: Inside the 
Reproductive Industry," and one of a group of experts who attended a 1990 World 
Health Organization policy conference on IVF. "A lot of couples go into it 
thinking: 'All right, I know the reality but I'm going to be the exception.' 
I've heard that over and over and over again. The whole technology is presented 
in a manner that encourages them to think that way. A lot of clinics, the way 
they talk to the patients sort of pumps them up to keep going back. It's a 
business, and like any business, you have to keep your clients coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many people would go to an IVF clinic if they read that 85% of couples go 
home without a baby?" she asks. "It's not that I think clinics should only 
emphasize the negative, but there isn't a balanced picture presented. If you go 
to your OB-GYN, does he have a wall of baby pictures? It's a form of emotional 
manipulation." 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of reproductive technology see things differently. Diane Aronson, 
executive director of the Somerville, Mass.-based national infertility consumer 
group RESOLVE, came to the organization years ago with her own problems. "These 
couples may be in a vulnerable position, but that doesn't mean they're not 
thinking, rational folks," she says. "Plenty of people decide, 'IVF is not for 
me.' That's their option. But everyone should have the right to become informed 
about IVF, to assess the risk and evaluate it for themselves." The question, 
though, is whether couples have a chance to make a truly informed decision. 
Does the data exist to help them weigh whether the short- and long-term risks 
are worth the potential benefit? Many in the field admit that the answer is no. 
</P>
<P>
 IN 1989, THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT ASSEMBLED A ROYAL COMMISSION to come up with 
guidelines and funding recommendations for the country's use of reproductive 
technology. The commissioners reviewed hundreds of studies from international 
research on the use of reproductive technologies for infertility problems. Last 
year, the they concluded that only one procedure -- standard IVF for treatment 
of blocked tubes -- had been proven in studies to give women a better chance of 
birth -- about 10% per attempt -- than no treatment at all. It recommended that 
no other form of the procedure get health-care coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission didn't say whether IVF works for other types of infertility, or 
that procedures such as GIFT or micromanipulation are not effective. But, says 
Dr. Patricia Baird of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, the 
pediatrician and geneticist who headed the inquiry, "we were really rather 
disturbed by the quality of the studies out there. Many of them have 
methodological weaknesses or small sample sizes. There's a real hodgepodge of 
women being treated, so you can't judge what the success rate is for different 
categories of diagnosis. There may be categories for which it's really not 
doing any good, and we need to sort that out, because IVF is invasive and 
expensive, and there are risks involved." 
</P>
<P>
 She adds: "It seems to us that everything except IVF for blocked tubes should 
be offered in the context of research trials, in which women are told these 
aren't proven treatments. They shouldn't have to pay, and they should have full 
information and informed consent." 
</P>
<P>
 The World Health Organization also has criticized the profit-driven 
proliferation of reproductive technology in countries around the globe and 
called for more clinical trials. Ask Dr. Maria Bustillo, current president of 
the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, if the United States should 
begin offering these in the context of clinical trials, and she laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love it," says Bustillo, who is the director of reproductive 
endocrinology at Mt. Sinai Medical Center in New York. "I'd love to be able to 
go back and do some really basic studies. It would be wonderful if people 
didn't have to pay these high costs, when we don't yet have the data to give 
them answers. But we can't even get money for doing basic research on 
endometriosis. Where would we get the dollars to do this? 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of things in medicine related to women's health get started and adopted 
without sufficient study; the purse strings have not been controlled by women." 
</P>
<P>
 But without the data that clinical trials would provide, reproductive centers 
are operating in a questionably gray area. For example, programs typically tell 
couples that their odds of giving birth stay the same for each IVF attempt, up 
through the fourth try (after which birth rates are known to dip 
precipitously). That may, in fact, not be so. A 1992 study by a Yale University 
professor, frustrated at his own and his wife's failure with multiple attempts, 
suggests that the chance of pregnancy drops even before the fourth try. Of 571 
women who started treatment at Yale, 13% got pregnant on the first attempt, 
10.7% succeeded on the second go-round, 6.9% on the third and 4.3% on the 
fourth. Edward H. Kaplan, professor of management sciences and of medicine at 
Yale, who authored the study, is cautious about applying his results to other 
clinics, but he believes that "you could end up spending a whole lot of money 
trying to get pregnant, when the chance is really very small." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberta Geist, 43 and a real estate agent, has spent a whole lot of money -- 
more than $30,000 -- trying to get pregnant. She's tried GIFT once and IVF 
once. At the moment, she's lying in a Century City recovery room after her 
third egg retrieval; she's preparing to try IVF again. Geist's chances of 
pregnancy, she's been told, are 10% to 14%. "While you have your period, you 
can still have a child," she says hopefully. "This should work." 
</P>
<P>
 Married at 38, Geist discovered after a year of trying to conceive that her 
tubes were blocked, her hormonal levels not optimal. "My husband won't let me 
adopt," Geist says. But she very much wants a baby. "I have that maternal 
instinct now," she says. "I want to be a mother. I'd love for this to work. If 
it doesn't, I don't know, I'll deal with it, but . . . ." A nurse standing 
nearby gives Geist a hug. "This is going to work," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't. In fact, a month later, after her fourth failed attempt, Geist 
gave up on the idea of genetic motherhood and was going to try again with a 
donor egg. 
</P>
<P>
 Further complicating the picture for patients confronting the 
assisted-reproductive-technology labyrinth is the dramatic fluctuation in 
take-home baby rates from clinic to clinic. Rates can vary from less than 5% at 
some programs to a high of more than 30% at others, according to Dr. David 
Meldrum, director of the Center for Advanced Reproductive Care at South Bay 
Hospital in Redondo Beach. "These are very complex procedures, with many 
different variables," Meldrum says. "The research hasn't been done yet that 
will show you, you must do this particular thing at this particular time to get 
the best results. Without that knowledge, each program varies in the small 
details that make the difference between success and lack of it." 
</P>
<P>
 He adds: "I've visited programs having great difficulty. They have individuals 
trying extremely hard to have a good outcome, they're very well trained, 
they're in agony, and yet it's difficult to put your finger on exactly where 
the problem is." 
</P>
<P>
 Couples can improve their odds by using groups like RESOLVE or the resources 
of the American Fertility Society to get success rate data on clinics that 
register with the society (most do). But checking on a particular clinic's 
rates in that manner still won't reveal how many of those who signed on at the 
clinic actually took a baby home, because the group presents such rates in 
terms of how many births a program has had, per egg retrieval, rather than in 
terms of births per started attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 15% of women don't get to egg retrieval, but those failures are 
discounted as if they never happened," notes Michael Katz, a supervisory 
investigative specialist with the Division of Service Industry Practices at the 
Federal Trade Commission. "The (American Fertility Society) position is that 
the whole process doesn't start until the egg is recovered. Our position is 
that the process starts when the consumer begins kicking over dollars; those 
drugs cost quite a bit of money." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the FTC, virtually the only agency to watchdog these clinics, 
has chastised several for representing their success rates in a misleading way, 
exacting promises from each to practice truth-in-advertising. But that's 
virtually as much outside regulation as the industry has been subject to. 
Although a voluntary lab accreditation program was recently initiated by the 
Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, nothing currently mandates that 
IVF labs be licensed or prove their competency in any way. 
</P>
<P>
 That could change. In 1992, Congress approved a bill scheduled to go into 
effect at the end of this year that gives each state the option to require that 
its IVF programs be licensed according to a national standard. It also demands 
that such clinics annually report success rates -- including numbers of started 
attempts as well as of egg retrievals -- to the government. Still, Rep. Ron 
Wyden (D-Ore.), who sponsored the initial bill, refers to it as "baby steps," 
and some complain that because clinic licensing won't be federally 
administered, the law has no teeth in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Such minimal scrutiny, combined with a technology evolving at warp speed, and 
stiff competition (billboards, radio spots, ads in upscale magazines designed 
to win business) to attract the minority of infertile couples who can afford 
assisted reproductive techniques, leaves a margin for abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ICSI procedure could be a case in point. In Britain, embryologists who 
want to use it must prove their competence, then apply for a treatment license. 
In the United States, any lab that wants to offer the technique can do so. Last 
fall, the procedure won its 15 minutes of fame here, touted in headlines and on 
"Donahue" and "Eye to Eye With Connie Chung," as the panacea for male 
infertility. "In big urban centers, people will call around to clinics asking, 
'Do you offer it?' " notes Barry Behr, director of the human embryology and 
andrology lab at Stanford University. "If you say no, they'll call elsewhere. 
It's a rat race; you almost have to stay one-up on the program down the road to 
get business." 
</P>
<P>
 As the hype flew, embryologists from around the country took off to Brussels 
to do a workshop at the clinic where ICSI had been developed. They returned to 
the United States with certificates to hang on their walls, stating that they'd 
taken the course. Yet, says micromanipulation pioneer Jacques Cohen of Cornell, 
"I'm afraid it is going to be used quite wrongly by most programs. It's one of 
the most difficult technologies I've ever been involved with. A lot of people 
think you can just take a needle, put a sperm in it and stick it in the egg. 
But you need the expertise to apply the procedure correctly." 
</P>
<P>
 Century City's David Hill, who spent several days studying the procedure at 
Reproductive Biology Associates in Atlanta, where the first U.S. ICSI baby was 
born last fall, readily admits that he's still straddling a learning curve. The 
fertilization rates he's getting aren't better yet than those with SUZI. "It is 
more challenging than other micro-manipulation procedures," says Hill, "but we 
won't charge extra for it until I've gotten three pregnancies. As I feel more 
comfortable with it, we may slowly, slowly start using it in lieu of SUZI." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all clinics may be that circumspect. Behr also fears that some programs 
will move straight to prescribing this more high-tech, and pricey, treatment 
for infertile couples when lower-tech solutions might do instead. That sort of 
practice, he adds, is relatively common. "It's one of the big controversies in 
the field today: At what point do you resort to these aggressive, invasive 
procedures?" he asks. "Some labs claim success using these aggressive 
treatments, while others can have success without them. In my mind, it's when 
you don't have to resort to pulling out every stop that you're doing a good 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 TODAY IS A GOOD DAY AT Century City; there have been two positive pregnancy 
tests. Although the chance of a miscarriage during 
assisted-reproductive-technology pregnancies is 25% (slightly higher than the 
percentage in the general population), positive tests are still cause for 
rejoicing. "I have a whistle I blow when someone gets pregnant," embryologist 
David Hill says. "I used to take Polaroids of myself doing handstands, but I 
stopped because of my back." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's concern for the patients he works with is evident. "Why aren't they 
getting pregnant?" he says of the Taylors. "I wish I knew. If I could bleed a 
pint of my own blood to get them pregnant, I would do it. In this business, 
that's not an infrequent feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Now sitting behind his desk, Hill is contemplating another troubling subject. 
Early last year, a collaborative study by epidemiologists from around the 
country suggested that the hormones used to stimulate women's ovaries to 
release extra eggs might raise their risk for ovarian cancer. "Let's assume for 
the sake of argument that there is an inherent risk," says Hill. "Now, I happen 
not to believe it. I think no study yet clearly shows that association. But 
let's say there was an association. This may still be something patients are 
willing to undertake, as long as they have a realistic estimate of the ratio of 
risk to benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is, the information doesn't exist to help patients make that 
assessment. Moreover, Robert Spirtas, chief of the contraceptive and 
reproductive evaluation branch at the National Institutes of Health, disagrees 
that this particular study should be discounted. He admits that the research 
had methodological flaws because the author had limited data. Still, he says, 
"the study raises an issue that we had really better look at" and notes that 
the institute plans to fund its own study on ovarian cancer and fertility 
drugs, which millions of American women have now taken. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, the potential risks of reproductive technologies have gone virtually 
unexplored. In 1990, the World Health Organization sharply criticized the 
infertility community for doing more research on "new and expanded uses for the 
technology" than its effects on women using it, or on their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one vast clinical trial, and no one is monitoring it," says author 
Ann Pappert. "No one has a clue about what the long-term effects of these 
technologies will be on the babies or on women, and nobody's doing much to try 
to find out. The whole history of reproductive medicine is filled with these 
breakthroughs that, 10 or 20 years down the road, fill hospitals with patients 
having breast implants or IUDs removed, or DES problems (related to the drug 
given to pregnant women in the '50s that caused cancer in some of their 
daughters). The truth is that instead of waking up after the fact, we should 
stop now and see if we're creating another problem." 
</P>
<P>
 With 23,000 high-tech babies born in this country, the American Fertility 
Society puts the birth-defect rate in these children at less than 3%, a figure 
equivalent to that in the general population. Preliminary data from Australia, 
however, suggests that the rate of certain defects may be elevated in high-tech 
babies. Moreover, about one in three assisted-reproductive-technology babies is 
a multiple birth -- twins, triplets or, rarely, a higher number -- a result of 
transferring several embryos at once into a woman's reproductive tract. 
Children of multiple births are significantly likelier to suffer a range of 
health and developmental problems that can be a consequence, as pediatrician 
and geneticist Patricia Baird puts it, "of being born too soon and too small." 
</P>
<P>
 And the advent of micromanipulation has raised an entirely new series of 
concerns. For some years, scientists have subscribed to a theory of natural 
selection to explain why 200 million or more sperm are in the average 
ejaculation when only one is needed to fertilize the egg. The thinking has been 
that it's the hardiest sperm that helps create a human being. But when an 
embryologist assumes godlike stature by arbitrarily selecting that single sperm 
from a marginal batch, it stands the concept of natural selection on its head. 
Critics fear that the children of ICSI could be the products of a conception 
not "meant" to occur. 
</P>
<P>
 IVF practitioners disagree. "Natural selection is baloney," scoffs Michael 
Tucker, scientific director of Reproductive Biology Associates. "The female 
reproductive tract is not an assault course, OK? It's not simply that Sparky 
Sperm, the biggest, meanest, toughest one, runs the marathon and gets to the 
top of the egg first. Other than the simple fact that sperm move toward the 
egg, the fertility event is close to being random." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Tucker concedes it would have been preferable if direct injection could 
have been tested in animals before being used in people. Earlier forms of 
micromanipulation were evaluated on non-human subjects, but ICSI is tricky to 
perform with animal sperm and eggs. In Belgium, where efforts are under way to 
track ICSI babies into young adulthood, rates of genetic defects seem to be no 
higher than in the general population. And for the most part, geneticists agree 
that a sperm can be malformed or sluggish without those attributes affecting 
its chromosomal content. Still, they point out that the generation of male 
children produced by micromanipulation is likely to endure its own infertility 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Olds-Clark, a Temple University medical school geneticist who is 
studying a mouse model of infertility, says: "Their sperm are carrying genes 
that won't allow the sperm of their sons to fertilize in a normal way. And 
what's true in mice is going to be true in humans." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Cornell's Jacques Cohen admits that there may be "problem groups" 
for whom micromanipulation is riskier. "Patients with unexplained fertilization 
failure who come to micromanipulation because regular IVF didn't work may have 
an increased incidence of congenital malformations," he notes. "But those 
patients are rare, and they are counseled accordingly." At least, they are at 
Cornell. Whether other clinics tell similar patients of this risk is not clear. 
 
</P>
<P>
 THE SOCIETY FOR ASSISTED Reproductive Technology's Maria Bustillo has heard it 
all before. She knows that when the negative side of the 
assisted-reproductive-technology balance sheet is totaled up, it smacks of a 
conspiracy being perpetrated by avaricious doctors on hapless couples. But she 
doesn't buy that point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 "We make a mistake if we just blame the providers of this technology," she 
insists. "A lot of this is patient-driven. You have a couple in front of you, 
she's 43 with a borderline FSH level (a hormonal measure) and you tell her till 
your face is blue that her chances of having a baby are less than 2% with IVF. 
And she goes through with it and gets an embryo or two, then wants to do it all 
again. Do I withhold that, as a doctor? If I do, they may go and get worse 
treatment somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, infertile couples themselves remain among the most ardent defenders 
of their right to persevere in the face of slender odds or possible risks. 
Between 1990 and 1992, Maria DiPaulo, 40, of Queens, N.Y., and her husband, 
Stan, 41, tried IVF seven times, thanks to insurance that paid all but $4,000 
of their $70,000 in medical bills. The two knew their chances would plummet 
after attempt No. 4. But, says Maria, "I wouldn't have cared if it was just a 
1% chance." She was also aware, since she repeatedly mainlined hormones, that 
"there could be repercussions in the years to come from all the drugs I took. 
But I guess I think about today; I don't worry about that far down the road. 
You get so set on doing whatever you can to make this pregnancy happen that 
risk isn't an obvious factor anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The DiPaulos, who recently adopted a little girl, say that as frustrating as 
their experience was, it was ultimately a positive one. "I think we never could 
have adopted if we hadn't gone through all this," Stan says. "It meant a lot to 
say we did everything we could." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Terry Matthews (her real name), 33, a New Hampshire travel agent 
who was born with only one ovary and lost the other to a cyst at age 24. 
Matthews, who tried to adopt but couldn't find an available birth mother, was 
told that, using a donor egg, she had a 30% to 35% likelihood of success -- a 
decent gamble. But she says slimmer odds wouldn't have deterred her. "When you 
make these decisions, they're not based on facts and figures; it's pure 
emotion," she says. "I don't know how low they would have had to have gone for 
me to say forget it -- 10%, 5%? I don't know. This was the only chance I had to 
have a child." In November, 1992, on a second IVF attempt, she gave birth to a 
boy, from her sister's donor egg. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, not even the sternest critics believe the IVF industry should 
grind to a halt. "I'm not calling for a moratorium," says author Pappert. "I 
just think there needs to be a hell of a lot more work done on determining the 
safety margin and on deciding who really needs it. And there needs to be more 
supervision." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Taylors, their determination to try ICSI hasn't wavered, but their 
focus is shifting slightly. As they prepare to return to Century City, they're 
also beginning the paperwork for adoption proceedings. "You grow up, as a 
woman, envisioning yourself going through the process of giving birth to a 
child that is biologically yours and your husband's," says Leslie. "I think 
that physical void will probably always exist, but from what I understand, when 
they put a baby in your arms, it's yours." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds John: "It's difficult. We're definitely going to give it another shot. 
But time keeps passing. We want an end to this. And I think this year we'll see 
that. One way or another. I think by the end of the year, we'll have a child."

VANISHED JAPAN; IMAGES OF A DISTANT -- AND LONGED-FOR -- PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Margaret Scott , Scott is a Tokyo-based writer. Bristol, whose work has 
appeared in Life and National Geographic, is 85 and lives in Ojai. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The real Japan isn't in Tokyo, one hears, but in the countryside. In truth, 
village Japan exists these days mostly in the imagination. For while a rural 
Japan of rice farmers and tradition slowly vanishes, its evocative role 
lingers: The village has become a symbol of what has been lost in modern, 
commercialized Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The village, circa 1946, was photojournalist Horace Bristol's subject, one 
that he approached as a storyteller with a camera. Soon after World War II, 
Bristol, with his 1930-vintage Rolleiflex, ventured, among other places, onto 
the island of Hatsu Shima, not far from Tokyo. There he recorded the women, 
wrapped in cotton, diving to collect seaweed for their livelihood. He traveled 
to villages in the foothills of Saitama Prefecture and photographed rice 
farmers and tea growers and communities that cultivated silkworms. He sold 
small books of his pictures to American GIs as presents from a quaint, exotic 
and defeated Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The passing decades have transformed Bristol's documentary images into 
remnants from a departed past. There are no seaweed divers on Hatsu Shima 
anymore; the tiny island in Sagami bay has been recast as a weekend getaway for 
Tokyo's affluent. And in Saitama, about 30 miles northwest of Tokyo, the rice 
paddies and tea terraces have given way to bedroom communities.  
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, nostalgia for the village is a potent theme in a debate over 
identity that recurs like a toothache in need of care. Ever since Japan 
embarked on a heady, successful drive to modernize and took as its slogan "Out 
of Asia, Into the West," the pendulum has swung wildly -- from utterly 
identifying with the West to an outright nativist rejection of Western values 
and culture. The idea of the village as the real Japan has been pitted against 
the industrialized city as the product of foreign influence. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's prosperous but recession-weary nation, a version of the old 
toothache still pains many Japanese. Is Japan part of Asia or the West? Has 
catching up with the West stripped Japanese of their traditions? What does 
village life mean now that only 3% of the population are farmers? 
</P>
<P>
 Nostalgia for the village, to be sure, is only one facet of this discussion. 
But images, such as Bristol's, of the vanished past fuel the question of what 
it means to be modern and Japanese. His photos will be on display from March 11 
to April 30 at the Gallery of Contemporary Photography in Santa Monica.

A SUITABLE MOM; A PRINCESS COSTUME, A CLEAN CLOSET AND A MONTH OF EPIPHANIES 
LATER, A WORKING MOTHER REFLECTS ON THE MIXED JOYS OF STAYING HOME FULL TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Karen Stabiner, Contributing editor Karen Stabiner's last piece for this 
magazine was on advertising aimed at children. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I didn't work today. 
</P>
<P>
 This might be no big deal for the 33% of American moms who stay home full 
time, but I went to work at 16, filing repair invoices at a Chevy dealership, 
and I haven't stopped since. I am confirmed workaholic -- by temperament, 
surely, but also by economic imperative, since I, like so many women, just 
didn't think to marry a pre-Clinton private-practice physician. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, I was one of those idealistic young women who, 20 years ago, bought 
everything the women's movement was selling. A career meant independence and 
identity. I was not going to be like my stay-at-home mom, who looked at her 
suddenly empty house one day and wondered what to do with the rest of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 All my friends had careers and then kids. We interviewed child-care people (my 
favorite was the 17-year-old boy who thought that tending babies was a good 
career move after a summer at McDonald's). We swapped nursing-mother horror 
stories, most of which centered on being trapped in a meeting at mealtime. We 
cut our hair short because we didn't have time to blow-dry the longer styles. 
We discovered that even the most enlightened male shows up at the dinner table 
at the appointed time assuming that someone will feed him. Our free time 
evaporated -- and we pretended it didn't matter because there was nothing we 
could do about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything got done somehow. We were no longer second-class citizens; if 
anything, given how much we did, we were better than equal. That shoulder pain 
wasn't from the Snugli straps -- it was from reaching up and over to pat 
ourselves on the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Convinced I was a member of an elite, if beleaguered, sect, I confidently 
signed 18-month-old Sarah up for what the preschool called a Mommy and Me 
class. It was supposed to be an opportunity for children to get used to school 
in two-hour sessions with their folks; as it turned out, I was the one who had 
trouble getting acclimated. Suddenly I was surrounded by women I hadn't known 
existed: my chronological peers, women in their 30s and 40s, who didn't work 
and didn't want to.  
</P>
<P>
 Excuse me. They didn't work outside the home for compensation. They were 
full-time mothers. But most of them had child care anyhow. They went to the 
gym. They seemed to have read recent books from beginning to end, and they 
cooked meals that took more than 20 minutes. Some of them had manicures, and 
all of them were less harried than my indentured pals and I. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst of all, they seemed happy. They weren't drooling for the chance to have 
a career. They were as smug as I was. In fact, some of them felt rather sorry 
for me, trapped as I was by fiscal circumstance. I wanted either to kill them 
or be adopted by them. 
</P>
<P>
 We circled each other warily. Moms with careers need to think that full-time 
moms are self-absorbed and limited (no, no, they reply, we're focused and 
devoted). They, in turn, want to find us distracted and uncaring (no, no, we 
insist, we're swimming in the economic mainstream and/or providing our children 
with a new, less lopsided gender model). We are too civilized to say so 
straight out, but everyone's self-esteem rides on being right: Getting up happy 
in the morning depends on believing you're living a good life. 
</P>
<P>
 Each side has its credentialed advocates, but nobody really knows how the 
other half lives. So I decided to find out, however briefly: I stopped working 
for a month to see what life was like on the other side (OK, OK, in the 
interest of full disclosure, I did two book reviews, got paid for this piece 
and did not hang up when my agent called). I took a dilettante's tour of what I 
secretly imagined was heaven on Earth -- and prayed would turn out to be a dull 
purgatory, since winning the lottery stands between me and a lifestyle choice. 
</P>
<P>
 I explained to Sarah, now 4, exactly what I was doing. I was working on not 
working; this was not a permanent change. 
</P>
<P>
 Going into this, I imagined such bliss. Let's be honest here (and I speak as 
someone who would just as soon read "Babar" to my daughter as watch a C-SPAN 
hearing): There's down time built into this child-rearing business. Our 
daughter's first six months of life revolved around a lot of sleeping, with 
nursing breaks in between; she didn't know that I raced back home four times a 
day from my book research to be there when she woke up. 
</P>
<P>
 I admit her second year was a bit harder. I have an office at home, and she 
quickly learned how to pick up the knife and plunge it directly into my heart. 
A favorite early sentence: "Mommy, you don't have to finish that chapter now. 
Your job is to play with me." But 3 and 4 filled up faster than I was ready 
for, with preschool every morning and various superkid activities in the 
afternoon. If I didn't work while she was otherwise engaged, I could be a 
regular Renaissance woman -- well-read, well-toned, my garden a bevy of organic 
vegetables rather than the site of an ongoing turf war between wimpy lettuce 
and bruiser weeds. And I wouldn't be distracted when she was around. I'd be 
serene. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did I start my sabbatical in the clothes closet, surrounded by piles of 
incipient hand-me-downs? For the first time since I became a mom, I had time to 
enforce the two-year rule: Anything that hasn't been worn in two years goes 
away. The same applied to the kitchen pantry. It was time to throw out the 
impulse-buy Asian fish sauces and the toasted buckwheat. And Sarah's complete 
photographic history awaited me -- two shelves' worth of unsorted snapshots, 
the profit from which has surely paid the private-school tuition for the lab 
owner's firstborn.  
</P>
<P>
 Truly, a woman's work is never done -- not by herself, if she has an outside 
job, nor, it seems, by her husband, who carries the what- a- day- at- the- 
office- I'm- too- bushed- to- do- anything chromosome. My own house reproached 
me. I was confronted by the true, silent casualty of working motherhood -- not 
my daughter so much as her physical environment. No wonder Sarah's idea of 
cleanup time is simply to stack her stuff next to her father's pile of 
newspapers or my magazine Tower of Pisa. 
</P>
<P>
 While the apple of my newly focused eye spent her mornings with her school 
buddies, I spent mine on drudge work. It hardly seemed the glorious existence I 
imagined the stay-home mom to have, but maybe the payoff would come later, when 
my kid came home and I was ready to engage in a play activity that would 
exploit her formidable fine-motor skills and guarantee her eventual success as 
a brain surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
 Except when she appeared one day, I was inserting little moth-repellent 
sachets into sweater bags -- an activity Sarah and her fine motor skills found 
fascinating, much to my horror. I have women friends who never learned to type, 
lest they be consigned to the typing pool; I harbor the same distrust of 
certain domestic skills. If you understand arcane rituals like the cleaning of 
tile grout with a toothbrush, you are doomed to repeat them.  
</P>
<P>
 I liked it better when she followed me into my office, turned on the ancient 
electric typewriter and poked out Happy Birthday Karen Love Sarah. My fondest 
childhood memory is of hanging around deserted restaurants on Saturday 
afternoons while my father sold dishes and pots and pans to their owners. In my 
early days I drank many a solitary Shirley Temple in dark, wood-paneled bars; I 
consumed fortune cookies while my dad flogged stockpots. Other girls imagined 
princes in castles. I had real-life adventures among men in tuxedos and women 
who wielded eyeliner with precise daring. So I like the idea of sharing my 
workplace, such as it is, with Sarah -- and I like to think that she likes it, 
too.  
</P>
<P>
 As to my essential role as the nurturing centerpiece of my child's universe: 
On my first Friday I hosted a "play date," a scheduled interaction that, in 
this era of justifiable paranoia, commuter students and too much to do, has 
replaced just hanging out with the kids on your block after school. I usually 
send Sarah to the homes of non-working moms, but this month I was determined to 
reciprocate. I proudly drove both girls home from school, served up a snack and 
waited to see what they might like to have me help them do. 
</P>
<P>
 They ran upstairs, and Sarah's friend tried to close the child safety gate 
that we haven't gotten around to removing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't," said Sarah. "We don't use that anymore. It's for babies." 
</P>
<P>
 "But if we close it, your mom won't be able to get upstairs." 
</P>
<P>
 I waited for Sarah to tell her friend how glad she was that I was home and how 
she wanted me to be with her every minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can close my door instead," said the light of my life, with what I thought 
was inappropriate glee. The next sound I heard was a loud slam. By the time 
they emerged, I had read two sections of the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 If she wants to discuss conditions in Sarajevo before bedtime, I'm ready. 
Heartbroken and feeling not a little displaced, but ready. 
</P>
<P>
 The second week was better. I came home from car-pooling and paged through the 
paper. I renewed my acquaintance with our NordicTrack machine. I had 
conversations with my husband that were more than two sentences long and did 
not begin, "I'm going to bed, but. . . ." I dragged out a couple of recipes for 
the simple reason that I like to cook them. The truth is, most working mothers 
make time for their kids by eliminating any time for themselves. Full-time moms 
-- or so it seemed to me -- at least have a little time to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 Once I got into the swing of not working, new vistas opened up. In the past, I 
would pick Sarah up at school and bring her right home so I could go back to 
work. Now we could go anywhere, and we did. As odd as it felt, we went to the 
park in the middle of a weekday afternoon. We lolled at the frozen-yogurt store 
while I waited for an officer from the responsibility police to come arrest me. 
We cruised the aisles at the arts-and-crafts store looking for things to make 
collages with -- and then I sat and watched while Sarah turned our kitchen 
table and floor into glitter beach, punctuated by rolling waves of glue. 
</P>
<P>
 I spent a blissful couple of days making her a dress-up costume, for no 
particular reason other than I had the time. My husband came home one day to 
find me sprawled on the floor, surrounded by yards of pink satin and floral 
lace, sequined braid and the tissue pattern pieces for a generic princess/bride 
outfit. 
</P>
<P>
 He froze. This was not his wife, who objected to pastels on moral grounds and 
took even the slightest alteration to her long-time tailor. This was the woman 
who represented a sizable chunk of the household's annual income. Finally, 
Larry found his voice. "Is this something you've known how to do the whole time 
we've been together?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Once convinced that my condition was temporary, he was amused. My friends were 
not quite so charitable. It's amazing, the hostility a little initiative can 
elicit. My working buddies allowed as how they would never have time to make a 
costume, even if they did know how to sew, which of course they didn't; it was 
such a retrograde pursuit, after all. Women who didn't work acted as though I 
had poached on their turf. I had a career. It wasn't fair for me to know how to 
sew. 
</P>
<P>
 All I had done was dust off a vestigial skill to make my daughter happy. But I 
felt like a traitor. Just for a moment, I had blurred the boundaries between 
working women and home-moms -- and taken all the fun out of the competition. A 
true adversarial relationship requires a foe who's clearly not like you. 
Otherwise, you have to wonder, why all the animosity in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
 At least Sarah was pleased. Ecstatic, actually; she wore the costume every 
time we had company. She put it on when she got home from school. She implored 
me to make a matching veil, and I did. She told everyone who asked, and several 
people who didn't, that her mother (it sounded like she spelled it in 
all-capital letters) had made it for her. 
</P>
<P>
 Heady stuff, to be the object of such unedited affection. Still, some little 
part of my brain protests: Play with her, it says, but do something else, too. 
I'm beginning to think that the categories are wrong. It's not working mothers 
versus stay-at-homes. It's a matter of how you define the world -- whether you 
need a public life or not. I know one ex-worker who stays home now with two 
boys and is busier than ever, fund-raising, working for political candidates; 
she needs to be, whether she gets paid for it or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Halfway through my month, God snickered, and for a daunting week I was 
completely on my own. My husband left town. Our child-care person, as if on 
cue, got sick. My sinuses flooded, but there was nobody around to feed me tea 
or tuck me into bed. When Larry gets sick, like most men, he assumes a woeful 
countenance and a prone position. But that kind of behavior presupposes the 
presence of a nurturing soul to look after him. Sick moms usually stay on their 
feet, particularly if there's no one above the age of consent to help them out. 
I was on call, dawn to dusk. Sarah is a reasonable child: Once we negotiated 
the number of times I would read "Nutcracker Noel" in any given 24-hour period, 
we were fine. But I kept thinking about what life would be like, hardest case, 
if both of us were sick and I had to be at the office, and there was no dad or 
child-care person coming back soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was an auditory hallucination, some side effect of the cold pills, 
but David Byrne's lyrics kept pumping through my soggy brain: "This ain't no 
party, this ain't no disco, this ain't no foolin' around." The stripped-down, 
strapped mom -- the one who lacks the resources to hire in-house child care or 
stay at home herself -- faces a world that is pretty unfriendly to the 
institution of motherhood it pretends to revere. The rest of us, the luckier 
ones, get distracted by all the infighting over what we ought to do, which in 
turn supports legions of social pundits looking for a topic to take a position 
on. But hey: Want a good mom? How about some decent corporate child care? How 
about participatory dads? How about paycheck equity, so that a woman's work is 
worth as much as a man's, and she doesn't have to stay home by default just 
because she earns less? I came of age in the era of conspiracy theorists: How 
about the notion that as long as middle-class women of clout keep snapping at 
each other, they'll be too busy to notice that momhood in general needs a 
societal helping hand?  
</P>
<P>
 So now, on top of everything else -- including my pending return to gainful 
employment -- I have to think about being a more charitable human being. I have 
to stop envying the top tax brackets and be more aware of what moms in general 
need. It's a full life. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end of my self-imposed exile, I attended a baby shower for my 
daughter's departing preschool teacher. We ate, swapped stories and watched her 
open presents. Then one mother presented her with a truly priceless gift -- a 
poster full of photographs of the kids in her class. She barely got her hands 
on it before the moms started passing it around, searching out our own children 
and our kids' best pals. 
</P>
<P>
 In the thin, wistful light of that autumn afternoon, our fingers lingered on 
those little faces, and then a strange thing happened. One woman called across 
the room to another, to tell her how lovely her daughter looked. Another 
commented on a happy, rascally picture of two boys. The generosity of the day 
demanded that one mom acknowledge another's delight. We had come to know each 
other's children so well that we could judge the appropriateness of an 
expression: Sarah, caught in some serene reverie, looked just like Sarah, and I 
was not the only one who knew it. 
</P>
<P>
 We are circumstantial friends, of course, brought together not by anything 
lasting, but by the single coincidence of our children's age. Next year, when 
many of them head off to kindergarten, only some of us will remain in touch. 
But we have handed our children over to the outside world together, if only for 
three hours a day, and that makes a bond -- one that for the moment blots out 
the differences among us. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a handful of us work (we're the ones quietly checking our wristwatches). 
Would any of the other women in this room, right this second, really be willing 
to say that we are bad parents? I don't think so. I don't know that the 
full-time moms are falling short, either. I can't be so condescending -- or so 
defensive -- anymore; I can envy them and do a good five-minute rant on how 
life is unfair, but that has nothing to do with them. 
</P>
<P>
 You might have thought that was going to be the soft-focus end of this little 
experiment. Not a chance. I am about to leave my kid again, so I'm looking for 
a bad guy to blame. If all moms are potential allies -- or if the dreadful ones 
are driven by individual character flaws, rather than their membership in a 
particular caste -- then where did we get the idea that we were at war? From 
Sarah's bookshelf. From the great childhood legends of our time -- or rather, 
the ones that the good people over at Disney have chosen to immortalize. We 
tried a Disney book embargo at one point, since they read like bad studio 
synopses and are riddled with redundancies and not a few typos, but gift-givers 
did us in. We are surrounded by tellings and retellings of a handful of fairy 
tales -- and who are the villains? Women (more often than not, moms and 
stepmoms). 
</P>
<P>
 There's the wicked queen in "Snow White," the nasty stepmother and stepsisters 
in "Cinderella," an octopodous Mama Cass look-alike in "The Little Mermaid," 
and the evil Malificent in "Sleeping Beauty," a far more interesting lady than 
the heroine's mom, who is such a cipher that the storytellers don't even bother 
to give her a proper name. Wonderful moms tend to die young and leave their 
daughters vulnerable: Belle in "Beauty and the Beast" must have inherited a 
whopping genetic legacy from her late mom, which spared her from resembling her 
Pillsbury Doughpop, Maurice, but we never get to meet the lovely matriarch or 
even find out what happened to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Where are the dads, meanwhile? Out, it seems -- or at least out to lunch. Snow 
White's father was too dense to realize he was marrying evil incarnate and no 
match for it once he had; Cinderella's pop made a similarly awkward choice and 
then dropped dead; Sleeping Beauty's dad, Stephen, is an ineffectual dolt; 
Ariel's father is in great shape for a guy his age, for all the good it does 
him. They are all too busy ruling their respective kingdoms -- or, in Maurice's 
case, trying to invent one. 
</P>
<P>
 In every story, the blame rests squarely on the distaff side: If mom had been 
less concerned with herself and more involved with her dear daughter, that 
sweet young thing would not have slept in the ashes/nearly had her heart cut 
out by the huntsman/pricked her finger on a spinning wheel (any mom worth her 
salt knows that you borrow extra plates rather than snub a single fairy)/faced 
a long life listening to a candelabrum do a Maurice Chevalier imitation. 
</P>
<P>
 So our daughters go to the movies and find out that Prince Charming is going 
to rescue them, and they'll live happily ever after, a lesson that guarantees 
job security in the fields of psychiatry and talk-show hosting for the next 30 
years. And they learn that it's mom's fault they got into trouble in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Mothers, in turn, get the not-so-subliminal message that they should and could 
be doing a better job. My husband, who also works at home, is held in high 
esteem by a lot of people who admire him for spending so much time with his 
daughter. But we both agree that I spend more time with her (which is why he 
can tell you what was in the newspaper this morning and I can't). And all I get 
is people speculating about whether I ought to spend more. How's that for a 
double standard? 
</P>
<P>
 I no longer think that happiness is a function of working or not. Nor do I 
think there will be a winner in the who's-the-best-mom sweepstakes. As the 
computer said in the movie "WarGames," after a frustrating game of 
thermonuclear tic-tac-toe, "The only winning move is not to play." I want to 
make my peace with me and with Sarah; that will suffice.  
</P>
<P>
 So at the end of the month, I told her what came next. Mommy was going back to 
work, in spades, about to spend six months researching a book that would keep 
me out of the house most of the week. I tried to be as matter-of-fact about it 
as I could, but I was wildly ambivalent. Not that I wanted, any longer, to be 
home full time. All I really wanted was choice -- which is, when you think 
about it, what any mother wants, the opportunity to do what she thinks is best. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah wasn't ambivalent at all. Her little face got long, and the edges of her 
mouth and eyes seemed to dip ever so slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sad to hear you say that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know," I said. "It makes me sad, too. But do you think you and I could make 
a plan for special time together?" 
</P>
<P>
 Instantly the skies parted, and the sun shone through. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like what?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh," I said, shuffling madly for an answer, "how about nighttime play dates? 
We'll get Daddy to make dinner, and as soon as I walk in the door, we'll just 
play until bedtime." 
</P>
<P>
 She was thrilled by the idea, and too polite to remind me that her father's 
idea of cooking a meal is paying for takeout. Life was back to normal. I am 
Sarah's mother and Larry's wife and the book's author, and if I have time for a 
monthly haircut, I'll feel that I've indulged myself. On bad days, I feel like 
the Oakland of human beings; as Gertrude Stein said, there is no there, there.  
</P>
<P>
 But most of the time it's OK. Really. The reflected light can be quite nice. 
The next day Sarah walked into what she considers our office, put a sheet of 
paper in the electric typewriter, typed madly for a moment and then handed the 
indecipherable results to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Want me to read it to you?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure." 
</P>
<P>
 She pointed to the letters and recited, "I love you Karen. When you are the 
best working girl I can love you very much."

YOUNG O.C. STAR LOSES EYE BUT NOT SPIRIT; ACCIDENT: ERRANT GOLF BALL GIVES 
OLYMPIC HOPEFUL NEW HURDLE. SHE AIMS TO GET OVER IT.

<P>
 If only it hadn't rained two weekends ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe then, a construction crew might have installed additional netting 
between the driving range and running track at Saddleback College on Feb. 21, 
as scheduled. And maybe a golf ball might not have soared over the protective 
barrier, as it did Feb. 23. And maybe one of the nation's most promising young 
track and field athletes might not need surgery to remove her eye, as she will 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 But fate did Ashley Bethel no favors. 
</P>
<P>
 Bethel, a two-time national youth pentathlon champion and aspiring Olympian, 
was running on the Mission Viejo community college's track when she was struck 
flush on the right eye by a golf ball hit from the adjacent driving range. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact ruptured the eyeball and left the 14-year-old Lake Forest resident 
blind in that eye. Doctors at the Doheny Eye Institute in Los Angeles 
determined Thursday that it will have to be replaced by a glass prosthesis. 
</P>
<P>
 So one of Orange County's rising track stars, whose top long jump mark of 19 
feet, 7 1/4 inches as a 13-year-old last summer would have placed her second in 
the 1993 California State high school girls' meet, will have to pursue her 
Olympic dream with only one eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me this was like a drive-by shooting," said Abby Bethel, Ashley's mother. 
"Here we were, doing track like we have for five years, minding our own 
business, and out of the blue our kid is struck down. It was a senseless, 
random act." 
</P>
<P>
 Random because of the incredible odds against such a mishap. 
</P>
<P>
 "You figure you're running around a 400-meter track, and someone 200 yards 
away hits a tiny golf ball -- what would be the odds it could hit her right in 
the eye at that time?" said Skip Bethel, Ashley's father. "They've got to be 1 
billion to one." 
</P>
<P>
 Senseless because the Bethels believe it could have been avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've found balls all over the football field and track, so they're getting 
over the nets," Skip Bethel said. "They either have to shut down the range at 
certain times or raise the nets." 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley, a 5-foot-8 eighth-grader at Los Alisos Intermediate School, has no 
intention of shutting down her track-and-field career because of the accident. 
She plans to compete in this summer's junior national and Junior Olympic meets, 
and she fully intends to accept an invitation to work out at the U.S. Olympic 
Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colo., in August. 
</P>
<P>
 She knows the road ahead will be difficult -- there will be several surgeries, 
and she'll have to deal with the emotional trauma of losing an eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of all the senses, losing sight is one of the most devastating," said Dr. 
John Irvine, who heads the team of four specialists treating Ashley at the 
Doheny Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 On the track, Ashley will have to learn techniques to compensate for her lack 
of depth perception, grow accustomed to protective eyeglasses and cope with the 
frustration of previously routine events -- high jump, hurdles, long jump -- 
becoming more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 But her goal is still to compete in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it will affect track or anything because I met an athlete 
(Wednesday) who has a glass eye, and he said everything is OK," said Ashley, an 
honor roll student who plays the violin and is involved in several 
extracurricular school activities. "I'll get over it, because I still have 
another eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm still angry because this didn't have to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The golf ball that struck Ashley wasn't the only one to fly onto the track 
that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before she got hit, we had three balls come over the fence, and right after, 
another one came over," said Ericka Metoyer, a freshman on the Saddleback track 
team. "We've been working out since September, and I would say a ball comes 
over every other hour, and with full force. It's not like someone's tapping 
them over." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Saddleback Community College District, which oversees 
operation of the $2.4-million, state-of-the-art range, and of Donovan Brothers 
Golf, the management company hired to run it, said they were aware of balls 
clearing the nets. 
</P>
<P>
 They've been trying to monitor where and when balls were landing in the track 
area and have made attempts to eliminate risk. The range, which opened last 
April, was shut down during football games last fall, and hitting stalls on the 
east side of the range, which are closest to the stadium, have been closed 
during stadium activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The range is bordered by netting, about 50 to 60 feet high, on both sides. A 
third net runs between the range and the stadium. Last summer, a large section 
of that barrier was increased to a height of about 80 feet to better separate 
the tee area from a child developmental center and the track. 
</P>
<P>
 There was one trouble spot, though. A section overlooking the southwest corner 
of the track, where the fence turned westward from the child developmental 
center, was left at about 60 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Kelly, district vice chancellor of administrative services, and Tony 
Carcamo, vice chancellor of fiscal services, said additional netting, which 
would have brought that barrier up to 80 feet, was supposed to have been 
installed beginning Feb. 21 -- two days before Ashley was hit. 
</P>
<P>
 But rainstorms before that delayed work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grounds were too wet, and the contractor couldn't get heavy equipment in 
to do the job," Carcamo said. "There was also a problem with one of the poles . 
. . and they had to stop installation." 
</P>
<P>
 Carcamo said work on the extension is being done, but as of Friday it had not 
been completed. Had the additional net been erected, the ball that blinded 
Ashley might never have reached the track. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a million 'what ifs,' " Skip Bethel said. 
</P>
<P>
 What if the eastern third of the range had been shut down while track practice 
was in session? Mike Donovan, who runs the range with his brother, Bill, said 
range employees could not determine who hit the ball that struck Bethel. "The 
person who hit it might not even know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Donovan believes the ball came from one of the 18 stalls on the range's 
east side, from which a powerful left-to-right shot would have the highest 
probability of reaching the track 200 to 225 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly said that before the accident, the east portion of the range would 
occasionally be shut down between 1 and 6 p.m. The Silver Wings Track Club, 
coached by Skip Bethel and Bill Norris, uses the track Mondays through 
Thursdays from 4:45 to 6 p.m., and the Saddleback track team has been training 
regularly during afternoons since January. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mike Donovan said the entire range was in operation at the time of the 
accident and that he had not been told in recent weeks to close the eastern 
portion in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no mandate (from the district) to close part of the range on a 
daily basis," Donovan said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was after the accident. The whole range was closed about an hour after 
Ashley was hit, and last week, the district ordered the eastern portion of the 
range closed between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly said he had assumed the eastern side of the range was closed at the time 
of the accident. He said he could not yet comment on whether a memo ordering 
the east side closure from 1 to 6 p.m. had been issued or, if it had been, why 
the entire range was open when Ashley was struck about 5:20 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what our investigation is all about," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly said an attorney for the district's insurance carrier is looking into 
the matter, and he didn't go into further detail. The Bethels have also 
retained an attorney, family friend Jim Crandall of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our theory is simple -- it was a defective design to put a driving range next 
to the track and child-care center," Crandall said. "They didn't shut it down 
when they knew balls were coming over the fence. With prior knowledge, they had 
a duty to remedy it. Our case will be based on design and negligence." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly expressed sorrow for the Bethels but said he doesn't believe the 
district was negligent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying everything we can to make it safe," he said. "That's why we've 
closed portions down, monitored balls, raised the nets. Our maintenance people 
have found balls on the track, but we never received complaints from people 
using the track." 
</P>
<P>
 Metoyer, the Saddleback athlete, was practicing the long jump when Bethel 
passed her on the track that afternoon. The sound of the ball striking the girl 
is etched in her memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the loudest thing I've ever heard," she said. "It sounded like the 
ball hit the pavement." 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley crumpled to the ground, screaming and clutching her eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I thought it was a shot put (ball)," Bethel said. "One of the girls 
on the Saddleback team ran toward me, held my hand and told me to calm down. 
She told me to remove my hand from my eye, and then she said, 'Oh, my God, we 
need a doctor.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It was Metoyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the most pain I've ever seen a person in," Metoyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 An ambulance took Bethel to Mission Community Hospital. The prognosis was not 
good. The cornea and sclera, the white part of the eye, were lacerated. There 
was heavy bleeding and a loss of tissue. The orbit, the bony cavity the eye 
sits in, was shattered. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that night, Ashley was transported to the Doheny Eye Institute, where 
she underwent a 6 1/2-hour operation to stabilize the eye the next day. She 
remained at Doheny until Feb. 26, receiving a steady stream of visitors, cards, 
flowers and calls, including one from Olympic heptathlon champion and 
world-record-holder Jackie Joyner-Kersee. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors warned the Bethels last week to prepare for a difficult decision -- 
whether to keep the eye and hope it would not be cosmetically different than 
the left eye, or have it removed, thus eliminating the chance for infection. 
But Thursday, that decision was essentially made for them: Doctors determined 
the eye could not be saved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ashley is losing a part of who she is, a part of her body, and if someone had 
said to me my child would be dismembered in some way, I wouldn't have been able 
to accept it," Abby Bethel said. "Now we're forced to accept it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley, though, has remained remarkably composed. She does not seem concerned 
that other kids might tease her about a glass eye. She does not see this as a 
setback to an already well-decorated track-and-field career. 
</P>
<P>
 Bethel's personal-best marks in the 100-meter hurdles (14.5 seconds) and high 
jump (5 feet, 4 1/2 inches) would be considered outstanding for a high school 
senior, and her long jump at the USA Track and Field Youth National 
Championships in Houston last summer would rank fourth among girls in Orange 
County prep history. She plans to play volleyball, basketball and track at El 
Toro High School next year and still has her sights set on the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have faith in God that He'll get me through this," she said. "I have my 
parents, my family, my friends. I still have another eye." 
</P>
<P>
 And her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The miracle may very well be that her life was spared, because had the ball 
hit her on the head, it may have killed her," Abby Bethel said. "The other 
miracle is Ashley has been able to handle this with such a grace and style that 
none of us could have. She's a very strong kid. That's not to say she won't 
have a grieving process, but she's been wonderfully accepting of this kind of 
tragedy." Track Accident 
</P>
<P>
 A young track athlete lost the use of her eye due to an errant shot from a 
neighboring golf driving range. The ball that hit her probably flew over a 
section of the protective fence line that is lower than the rest of the mesh.

O.C. VIETNAMESE MAGAZINE SEEKS GLOBAL AUDIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The short history of Vietnamese-language publishing in this country has been 
controversial and violent. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1980s, three journalists -- among them a Garden Grove publisher and 
a San Francisco youth group leader -- were killed and a number of others 
injured or threatened for advocating normalization with Hanoi or publishing 
what was construed as pro-Communist viewpoints. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, 19 years after the war that forced the exodus of 1.5 million Vietnamese 
from their homeland, the winds of change are being felt and, in some circles, 
resignedly accepted. Violence against moderate or liberal Vietnamese 
expatriates is rare. 
</P>
<P>
 This optimism, coupled with President Clinton's decision last month to end the 
trade embargo with Communist Vietnam, has led a group of entrepreneurs to 
publish the first international Vietnamese-language magazine. They hope it will 
finally help heal and unite their fractured, exiled worldwide communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Called Nguoi Viet The Gioi, or Viet & World, the magazine will attempt to 
unite Vietnamese communities by informing expatriates of international news, 
features and personalities as they relate to their culture, heritage and 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine's creators say they hope that Viet & World will eventually become 
the Newsweek or Time magazine for Vietnamese readers who live abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is our plan for this magazine, which will introduce our people to each 
other and remind us to never forget our roots," says editor-in-chief Viet Khanh 
Nguyen, whose pen name, Son Dien, is well-recognized by Vietnamese readers. 
"And we want as many people as possible to have access to this publication." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-thousand copies of the premier issue are scheduled to hit the stands in 
Little Saigon on Saturday, and 10,000 in Germany the following week. 
Thereafter, more will be printed for other Vietnamese communities in 
California, other states and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Orange County, the largest Vietnamese enclave outside of Southeast 
Asia, and elsewhere in the country, dozens of large and small Vietnamese 
publications come and go. But Nguyen and his partners are optimistic that Viet 
& World will not only thrive in this cutthroat business, but become the 
educational and entertainment magazine that Vietnamese outside their native 
country, or Nguoi Viet Hai Ngoai, would turn to. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many Vietnamese newspapers in the different communities but there 
is not one magazine that serves as a voice" for all expatriates, says Ngoan Le, 
board director of UniMedia Corp., which publishes the magazine. "We want to 
become that voice." 
</P>
<P>
 A lofty goal but not impossible given the reputation and experiences of the 
men and women who have come together to create the colorful, glossy magazine. 
The seven-member board of directors of UniMedia comprises Vietnam's premier 
actress, Kieu Chinh, and a cadre of well-known Vietnamese literati. 
</P>
<P>
 One is the 72-year-old Nguyen, also editor-in-chief of Westminster's Vietnam 
Economic News and formerly the managing editor of the Vietnam Press News Agency 
of the Republic of Vietnam before the country fell to Communists in 1975. 
Another is Yen Do, editor of Nguoi Viet Daily, the largest Vietnamese-language 
daily in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Given Nguyen's and Do's admitted partiality to hard news with an economic 
slant, board members and staff writers Nha Ca, a novelist, and her husband, 
poet Tu Tran, will lend their literary touch to the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Always cognizant of the political atmosphere in the Vietnamese community, Viet 
& World will intentionally remain "neutral" on the most important, debated and 
divisive issue of the collective Vietnamese community -- whether the U.S. 
should normalize relationships with the Vietnam government, the next logical 
step on the heel of resumption of commercial trade between the two former 
enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 Viet & World's neutrality will separate it from most other Vietnamese 
publications. Although the magazine's directors realize that moderate voices in 
the past have been met with violence and demonstrations, they say they will not 
be deterred in their mission to be objective. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inside those of us who have had personal experiences with the Communists, 
there will always be a want for revenge," said Nha Ca, who, along with her 
husband, languished in the Vietnam government re-education camp for 12 years 
because of their literary connection during the previous regime. "But we cannot 
deed our bitterness and hatred onto the younger and new generations. It is too 
heavy a burden for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnamese publishing in the United States had its genesis with what has 
become the country's largest daily newspaper of its kind, the Nguoi Viet Daily. 
The 12,000-circulation newspaper began in 1978 in editor Yen Do's Santa Ana 
tract home. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few miles away, Viet & World's launch is similarly unassuming. 
</P>
<P>
 Its newsroom -- if it could even be called that -- is modest and sparse. Just 
three cubbyholes for writers and two austere offices, one with a portable desk, 
the other with three all-important Macintosh computers. There is no copier -- 
the solo fax machine does double duty. In all, there are only five on staff, 
and that includes editor-in-chief Nguyen, who works 12-hour shifts seven days a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 It is from this humble, obscure setting in the heart of Orange County's Little 
Saigon that a new phase has evolved within the Vietnamese publication milieu. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine's immediate goal is to get Vietnamese communities to prepare for 
unprecedented celebrations to greet an upcoming historical epoch -- April 30, 
1995, the 20th anniversary of the day their country fell and the day many fled 
Vietnam to rebuild their lives in a new world. 
</P>
<P>
 The first issue is dedicated to this painful, historic commemoration, with 
articles whose underlining theme is that it's time Vietnamese leave the past 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Viet & World's long-term aim is to encourage the young Vietnamese to learn 
about or continue to preserve their Asian traditions and culture, a heritage 
which many in the older generation lament their children and grandchildren have 
lost in their quest for assimilation. For the younger generation, each issue 
will have articles on Vietnamese traditions and historic events as well as 
profiles on Vietnamese youths who are contributing to their community. 
</P>
<P>
 For other readers, Viet & World -- which also has a smaller English-language 
section -- will have news, business stories and features from the various 
Vietnamese enclaves. "We want to make sure every issue of the Vietnamese 
community is discussed, whether in English or in Vietnamese," said Michael 
Nally, editor of the English section. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the articles in the English version target the younger generation -- 
youths who are not proficient in Vietnamese. Among features in the first issue 
is Nally's question-and-answer with a Garden Grove honor student who writes for 
the student newspaper. Another story is a profile of a Vietnamese boat refugee 
who is now a youth pastor in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 The premier issue, and those following it, will feature stories that run the 
gamut from news on the economy and state of technology to profiles on the 
lifestyles of the not-always-so-rich-and-famous fellow Vietnamese expatriates. 
For example, one article in the first issue discusses the need for a Vietnamese 
Memorial -- akin to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington -- in Vietnam 
to recognize the men and women who died fighting for their country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Millions of Vietnamese men, women and children died fighting in my homeland," 
said actress Kieu Chinh, who is also a member of the group that wants to 
establish the memorial. "We want to express our gratitude and love to those who 
have died for a noble cause." 
</P>
<P>
 How is it that the seven board members of UniMedia think they can launch an 
international magazine with a paltry $50,000? By pooling their resources, 
seeking contributions of other Vietnamese business leaders and not getting paid 
initially, they confidently reply. Also, many major French and American 
companies, such as Martell liquor and MCI Communications Corp., have already 
committed advertising revenue to the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know $50,000 seems like a small sum for this kind of venture," said board 
President Kieu Chinh, who recently starred in the movie adaptation of Amy Tan's 
"The Joy Luck Club." "But we don't have to worry about the biggest expense, 
which is printing and which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 That is because board director Le is president of Orange-based Annam Printing 
Inc., and has donated his press. Le persuaded the owner of a Vietnamese 
printing company in Bonn, Germany, to publish the magazine in Europe. A similar 
agreement is in the works with a printing company in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 In marketing the magazine to Vietnamese communities, UniMedia has begun with 
advertising in a handful of Vietnamese-language newspapers. But because of the 
lack of capital, most of the marketing initially is being done in a very 
old-fashioned Vietnamese way: word-of-mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 The marketing plan is unconventional, Kieu Chinh admits, but already, business 
people in Vietnamese districts in San Jose, San Francisco, Houston and Dallas, 
Texas, Washington, France and Germany are aware that Viet & World will hit 
their newsstands as early as the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may sound different, funny, even impossible, but that's how things 
traditionally work with our people," says Kieu Chinh, who's also in charge of 
public relations. "In our case, each of our board members knows people who know 
other Vietnamese in different communities around the world, and all indications 
show that Viet & World will be well-received." 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts in the magazine industry, however, are not so sanguine. 
</P>
<P>
 Clay Felker, a longtime magazine editor and educator, criticizes as 
impractical the very reasons Viet & World's creators cite in explaining the 
need for an international magazine. Felker, who launched the now-defunct New 
West magazine in 1976 after successfully founding New York magazine, believes 
the worldwide Vietnamese communities are geographically too distanced to give a 
magazine like Viet & World the circulation it needs to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, he says, younger generations, once assimilated to their new 
culture, tend not to be interested in magazines published in their native 
language. Viet & World has "a perfectly laudable objective, and publications 
aim toward a specific community do help to identify common bonds," he says. 
"But traditionally, those publications have not been successful beyond their 
immediate community." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen and his partners acknowledge they have a long road ahead of them before 
Viet & World could ever become entrenched in the collective Vietnamese 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not saying this will immediately become the Vietnamese Time or 
Newsweek," the editor said late one evening after everyone had gone for the 
day. "Those companies have money and a foundation of a well-known reputation 
already under them. We are a smaller and poorer group and so we have to start 
much more slowly." 
</P>
<P>
 But what he and his lifelong friends and colleagues do have are dreams and 
writers, a couple of computers, an expensive printing press and people who are 
willing to give their time and efforts to began a magazine for the Vietnamese. 
Those things and the fact that "no one has tried this before," he says, "makes 
this a pretty good start."

EMPTY BUILDINGS ARE CONSTANT REMINDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A blocklong apartment building, its tan walls cracked and badly buckled, 
stands between Laura Stagliano and her attempt to forget the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 For Al Goldfarb, the offense is a three-story complex cracked neatly in half. 
And for Elizabeth Wride, it is the cement-and-wood hulk of an apartment 
building across the street, listing off its foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 More than six weeks after the Northridge quake left almost 600 apartment and 
condominium complexes beyond repair throughout the city of Los Angeles, the 
impatient neighbors of abandoned buildings have grown tired of their exclusive 
view of the worst of the quake damage, and they are starting to complain. 
</P>
<P>
 They have watched the vacant and sometimes crumbling buildings attract an 
eclectic mix of people -- from the occasional squatter and the awed tourist to 
the security guards and demolition workers, who stand by to enter condemned 
buildings and, for a fee, rescue belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like a circus here with all these strange people going past all 
the time," said Wride, watching a group of eight building and safety 
supervisors in coats and ties survey buildings in her hard-hit Sherman Oaks 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials say the offending buildings probably are not going away, at 
least not in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been getting complaints from the public as to what's taking so long, 
and our response is that you've got to give these apartment owners a chance to 
get this right," said Larry Brugger, chief of the earthquake safety division of 
the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety. "Every engineer and 
architect in this city is just swamped with work, plus many owners are having 
to wait to get financing through FEMA . . . and that doesn't take overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 Apartment owners agree. "Our hands are tied," said Matthew Hodge, who owns a 
red-tagged building in Sherman Oaks and has applied for a government loan. 
"Everyone wants you to jump through hoops, but in the end you just hurry up to 
wait. . . . You need money before you can do anything and the money hasn't come 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills resident Stagliano, however, who lives next to a boarded-up 
building on Devonshire Street, is in no mood to be patient. "Having to look at 
that building every day does nothing to help get the earthquake out of my 
mind," she said. "The cracks make my skin crawl. They just need to fix it up, 
or tear it down." 
</P>
<P>
 That will prove to be more difficult than it sounds. The Jan. 17 quake created 
a giant backlog for city officials by damaging about 250,000 buildings 
throughout the city -- and more than four out of five were apartment and 
condominium complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, for structures not considered hazardous, city laws usually give 
owners 30 days to submit repair schedules unless they request an extension, 
which Brugger said are likely to be granted in the post-quake period. 
</P>
<P>
 And, if a structure is declared a hazard -- yet is not in immediate danger of 
collapsing -- owners must fence it off and are given 10 days to submit a repair 
plan, which then must be approved by the city before work can begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Only when city inspectors decide that a particular building is an immediate 
hazard can the structure be torn down without notice. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the city has ordered about 40 buildings demolished, but officials warn 
that might be only the beginning. "There might be many more if the economy 
doesn't pick up," said building and safety supervisor Jerry Takaki, "because 
owners might not be able to afford to make the required repairs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the short time they've been empty, many apartment buildings have been 
transformed from homes into monuments of the earthquake's destructive force. 
</P>
<P>
 Bathroom mirrors and tiles are shattered. Carpeted floors creak underfoot and 
are rife with sinkholes. Plastic vertical blinds clap together when a breeze 
blows through broken windows. 
</P>
<P>
 At a 43-unit complex at the corner of Reseda Boulevard and Strathern Street in 
Reseda, signs of a hurried departure are everywhere. The building's only 
reminder of life is its pungent odor. 
</P>
<P>
 In apartment after deserted apartment, there is no electricity, no running 
water, the floors are a sea of broken glass and of spilled contents left to 
mold. Only the most insignificant items -- or those simply too heavy -- were 
left behind: A broken-down yellow Camaro sits under a carport, which itself 
leans badly to the right. Two brick chimneys, each once more than 20 feet high, 
lie in pieces on the cement. A child's bicycle sits in front of one apartment, 
next to a collapsed staircase. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside a well-stocked kitchen, its cupboards jammed with crackers and peanut 
butter and cans of soup, the smell of spoiling mayonnaise and rotting ground 
beef waft from a refrigerator left open. 
</P>
<P>
 At a California motel-style complex on Devonshire Street in Granada Hills, a 
living room that might once have been the center of a family's social life is 
battered -- its walls split open, revealing water pipes peeking out from behind 
tufts of yellow insulation. 
</P>
<P>
 An aquarium that fell and broke lies in shards on the floor, but there is no 
sign of the fish. In the middle of the room, a pink tricycle and a pair of 
underwear also have been left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, Apartment 202 has had a mail delivery: the February issue of Sunset 
magazine, which includes a feature about roses. 
</P>
<P>
 On the complex's bulletin board, a flyer for a construction company advises 
residents to call 1-800-IM-SHOOK to receive rebuilding help. A newspaper 
announcing the earthquake, dated Jan. 18, sits yellowing in a hedge out front. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days following the quake, refugees from the Reseda apartments set up 
camp in a vacant lot out back. Weeks later, the people are gone, but they have 
left behind their lean-tos -- made from plastic garbage bags and cardboard 
propped up by sticks, the ground covered with carpet remnants pulled from the 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 The field has attracted children, who haul away junk on their bikes, and other 
scavengers who look for things of value. On one recent afternoon, Jesus Ortiz 
walked around the field, scanning for recyclables that would earn him a few 
dollars. Eventually, he lashed 25 water-soaked mattresses onto his pickup 
truck. At a mattress reconditioning factory downtown, he hoped to earn $4 for 
each one, which, he said, is "not bad money." 
</P>
<P>
 But the boarded-up buildings also have been a bonanza for those less than 
honest. For instance, the vacant Park Balboa apartments in Granada Hills have 
been hit twice by burglars. First, thieves took stereos, jewelry and clothes, 
the apartment manager said. The next time, they took all of the apartment's 
circuit breakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if the thief is an electrician or what," mused manager Gabriel 
El-Tawil. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, there have been more than 200 burglary-related arrests at vacant 
buildings in the Valley and dozens of trespassing arrests, police say, creating 
a booming market for fence and security firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge Meadows Apartments have been patrolled at various stages by the 
National Guard, the police and now private security guards. Of all the 
apartment buildings destroyed by the quake, this is the most infamous because 
16 people died inside when the three-story structure pancaked into two levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, a security guard actually spends most of his time talking to tourists 
who "oohhhh" and "aahhhh" at the building as parts of it continue a slow 
descent to the ground. He overhears rumors -- that people are paying day 
laborers $50 to retrieve their possessions, that there is another body still 
buried inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of (the people) are pretty morbid, but some live in the area," said the 
guard, who declined to give his name. "Most are just awed. They ask, 'Is this 
the building where all those people were killed?' Then, they pose for pictures 
in front of the building." 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Dell of Canoga Park and Thelma Mahaffey of Reseda were two of hundreds of 
people who have viewed the collapsed building. Dressed in pink and purple 
warm-up suits, the two were taken aback by the sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a real loss, and unless you see it in person, you don't appreciate 
it," Dell said. "If the developers don't take more responsibility for people's 
lives, then they should be shot. They're playing with people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahaffey nodded in agreement and the two walked away. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the corner, Michael McPhilomy -- a demolition man who has a contract 
with the building's owner to rescue belongings for survivors -- lives out of a 
mobile home, waiting to be of service. 
</P>
<P>
 McPhilomy charges $250 to clear a one-bedroom place, $350 for two-bedroom 
apartments. Armed with a building plan, his four-person team enters apartments, 
usually by drilling holes into walls. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, about half of the residents of the Northridge Meadows complex and the 
apartment building next to it have used the company's services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten hospital beds and everything else out of there," McPhilomy said 
about the collapsed complex. "How do we get them out of there? Very carefully. 
. . . We try to get the stuff they need to go on with their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 At some complexes, former tenants have not faced that additional expense, 
either because they were allowed to venture back inside to retrieve their own 
possessions or because rescue workers agreed to carry things out for them for 
free. 
</P>
<P>
 Alf Kelly watched recently as firefighters brought out his neighbors' 
belongings from a Sherman Oaks apartment building on Woodley Avenue -- which 
collapsed when a ground-floor parking garage gave way -- and swore he was 
finished with apartment living. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't go into any apartment, because I don't believe any are safe," he 
said. For the present, Kelly lives at his girlfriend's house, sleeps in his 
clothes -- wallet and keys in his pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that I'm scared of earthquakes," he said, glancing at the complex's 
caved-in roof. "I just don't want to be buried."

RESCUED MAN GIVES THANKS AT CEREMONY 
</P>

 Salvador Pena, the 43-year-old janitor trapped under two floors of a shopping 
mall garage during the Northridge quake, shook his rescuers' hands Saturday and 
uttered to each of them one of his few English phrases: "Thank you very much, 
my friend." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of what was billed as a community tribute to those who helped the city 
dig out after the Jan. 17 quake, Pena braved a chilly day in the parking lot of 
the hobbled Northridge Fashion Center -- not far from the spot where 20 tons of 
concrete crumbled on top of him as he operated a power sweeper on the garage's 
first floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena was not asked to speak to the 150 or so residents who gathered at the 
event, but told reporters through a translator that the pain from his crushed 
legs and damaged right hand was not enough to keep him away. In a wheelchair, 
he was helped to the stage by some of the same people who rescued him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to come and thank these people out of my own heart," Pena said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Salvadoran immigrant, whose rescue was beamed throughout the country on 
live television, became a symbol of victims of the temblor's worst devastation 
and the best efforts of the public safety workers who dug for seven hours to 
free him. 
</P>
<P>
 But wearing a Los Angeles Fire Department cap and a large crucifix around his 
neck, Pena was less upbeat than he has been in previous interviews. He said he 
was unsure when he would be released from Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center, or 
if he would walk again. 
</P>
<P>
 A power sweeper with Industrial Janitor Service in Van Nuys, Pena made $6 an 
hour; much of his earnings were sent back to El Salvador to support four of his 
five children who live there with his wife, Gloria de Pena. Pena told reporters 
he did not have a tally of his medical expenses and was not receiving 
assistance to pay those bills. 
</P>
<P>
 As he faced the crew that saved his life, Pena stared at the men intently. 
Some of Pena's rescuers were emotional about the meeting with the man they 
saved. "I feel like crying," said Lorenzo Izarraraz, the 20-year-old 
firefighter trainee who translated encouragement and instructions into Spanish 
the morning of the quake, shouting to the buried Pena through the cracks in the 
concrete debris. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not like when you cry when you're mad or hurt, but when you cry about a great 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Izarraraz recalled promising Pena that firefighters would rescue him even 
though he was not sure they could. "There was so much concrete on top of him," 
Izarraraz explained. "He was just screaming and screaming." 
</P>
<P>
 Pena shared the stage with various city and county honorees, including Police 
Chief Willie L. Williams, Fire Chief Don Manning and City Councilman Hal 
Bernson, who organized the event along with mall officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Meline, a member of the county's Urban Search and Rescue team, crouched 
next to Pena's wheelchair and asked Izarraraz to tell Pena that he admired him. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the one who inspired us to continue," Meline said later. "Initially, 
it looked really hopeless and we were there trying to encourage him. We got a 
lot of strength from him."

ONE-MAN PATROL; CRIME IS DOWN IN MOUNTAINS SINCE DEPUTY TOOK OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like some high-country wilderness guide, Bennie Garnes scans the horizon and 
senses trouble. The weather, at best an unpredictable animal in these mountain 
parts, seems poised to strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The blustery night has brought six inches of new snow to the San Gabriel 
Mountains -- a heavy load that makes driving treacherous. Now the wailing wind 
and promise of another storm have whipped up fresh concerns in the mind of Los 
Angeles County's most isolated deputy sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
 Garnes has spent the morning cruising the frozen white-washed roads in his 
secluded corner of Angeles Highway in and around the town of Wrightwood, 
looking for tire tracks gone awry, a sure signal of a downed motorist. 
</P>
<P>
 For five winters now, Garnes has been the highest cop in Southern California 
-- a lone-patrol deputy whose beat stretches 300 square miles across northern 
Los Angeles County, rising clear to 8,000 feet, higher than many Colorado ski 
resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 A river -- known as Big Rock Creek -- runs through this patrol territory, 
which extends from the San Bernardino County line west to the Vincent Gap, 
ranging north and south between highways 138 and 2. It is an area of 
still-wild, often-inhospitable country the size of the San Fernando Valley, a 
domain dominated by National Forest land. 
</P>
<P>
 Near Vincent Gulch Divide, Garnes spies two young hikers, their faces tucked 
into parkas as they ready for a trek toward the old Big Horn gold mine. Garnes 
doesn't trust them any more than he does the weather. He swings the black and 
white, four-wheel-drive sheriff's cruiser around and questions the pair like a 
suspicious night security guard -- demanding their estimated time of departure 
from the woods. His woods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, this just isn't a good day for a winter walk," he says as the hikers 
hustle off under cruel, iron-gray skies. "But I can't stop them from going in 
there. This is National Forest land, open to the public. My job is to keep an 
eye on them, make sure they don't do anything stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 During summer months, Garnes helps patrol a 1,000-square-mile expanse of high 
desert into the farthest reaches of the Antelope Valley. But -- from 
Thanksgiving to Easter -- he becomes a mountain man, a loner. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, he is the only lawman many residents ever see in this high-country 
terrain populated not only by commuting big-city professionals and day-trip 
skiers, but by stately pinion pines, bald eagles, brown bears and mountain 
lions. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a police department's urban foot soldier, his job is to create a presence 
throughout this mountain country. Since he began as Wrightwood's resident 
sheriff in 1989, crimes such as drug possession and equipment theft at the 
nearby Mountain High ski resort have plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also played a key role in numerous rescues of hikers and skiers who 
became lost in an area that is 52 miles away from the nearest L.A. County 
sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
 Day after day, as he patrols the lonely wilderness trails and winding 
highways, Garnes feels more like a Montana lawman than one working 50 miles 
north of the nation's second-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, this far-flung patrol has qualified him as the only L.A. 
County sheriff's deputy with department-issue snow shoes, foul-weather parka 
and furry, Moscow cap. "And I'd bet money," he says, "that I'm the only local 
deputy who's ever entertained a high-speed pursuit with a snowmobile." 
</P>
<P>
 The 44-year-old Garnes, who began his law enforcement 20 years ago patrolling 
the streets of South-Central Los Angeles, came to the mountains following the 
discovery of a 9-year-old boy who had frozen to death under a foot of snow 
after wandering away from a church outing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's authorities soon decided they needed a stronger presence around 
Wrightwood, which on many winter weekends sees its 2,500 population increase 
tenfold with skiers, snow-boarders and tumbling tobogganers. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents had also complained that deputies summoned during winter storms 
would show up in their shiny black street shoes, ignorant of the area, 
worthless as a hound dog with a bad cold. 
</P>
<P>
 So Garnes, who had lived in Wrightwood since the mid 1980s, was assigned 
there, at first just on weekends. His presence was felt within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Garnes rescued a 16-year-old avalanche victim trapped under four feet of snow 
for more than 95 minutes -- surviving the longest such ordeal in the United 
States, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Now full-time, Garnes spends his days as a voice of reason for city-folk who 
rush to the mountains at the first sight of snow, often ignoring the simplest 
precautions. 
</P>
<P>
 On snowy days, he tickets motorists whose cars slip and slide along mountain 
roads without chains, searches for lost skiers who decide to forge their own 
trails. He organizes emergency response efforts for sledders with broken backs, 
hikers with frostbite. 
</P>
<P>
 Several weeks ago, Garnes headed the unsuccessful rescue attempt for a woman 
who drowned after falling through the thin ice of local Jackson Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 He calls them flatlanders, the overzealous city-dwellers who see the 
snow-capped distant mountains and run toward the hills as though on some 
frenzied gold rush. Many wanderers assume they're safe just because they can 
often see the downtown skyline from the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting high jinks -- some of them deadly -- make Garnes shake his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it, a lot of people who come up here are knuckleheads," he says. 
"In altitude, this place is more like Alberta, Canada, than Los Angeles County. 
I've seen too many people in jean jackets and tennis shoes who have no clue 
about how fast things can change around here, who have no respect for the 
terrain, the weather or the wilderness." 
</P>
<P>
 Not Garnes. His time in the San Gabriels has taught him a love and respect for 
this rugged landscape, where avalanches and and rock falls occur almost 
whimsically, where "icy road" signs mean business, a place where the fat pinion 
pine cones are among the largest of their kind in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 With his thick mustache, Garnes is a walrus of a man resembling Captain 
Kangaroo. He is soft spoken -- a cop who would rather give a warning than a 
ticket, one who gets a kick out of helping to chase a neighbor's stray cow down 
a mountain road. 
</P>
<P>
 The steep San Gabriels, he says, are among the most dangerous mountain ranges 
in the world. Garnes delivers such statements because he knows the land. He 
knows the secret fishing holes where you can find 14-inch trout and can show 
you the inspiration points where a person with decent eyesight can see for 150 
miles or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, he has come to appreciate the blanketing beauty of the 
season's first snowfall. He has sat in his cruiser eyeing a cagey mountain lion 
or Big Horn sheep pad across the road, a bald eagle soar like a feathered 
hang-glider, gaining altitude with one flap of its majestic wings. 
</P>
<P>
 But he has also come across a more perverse side of these woods -- the 
pornographic movies shot here, covert drug dealing, drunken drivers careening 
home from a day of skiing. He has chased down escapees from the nearby prison 
fire camp, arrested suspects in the selfish thievery of everything from trucks 
to snowboards. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a cagey animal, Garnes has taken a bite out of crime in this backcountry. 
Between 1989 and 1993, ski-theft incidents, for example, fell from 302 to 41. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting as his own one-horse patrolman and detective, Garnes has made 76 felony 
arrests since 1989, collars ranging from narcotics crimes to fraud, robbery and 
burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 Locals like what they see. Thanks to Garnes, Wrightwood is a place where 
people don't always bother to lock the front door. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just makes us feel safe up here," said Charlie Koenig, owner of Charlie's 
Market in Wrightwood. "Time was, it took a deputy three hours to get here on a 
call, if they came at all. But Bennie is here within minutes. He's one of us." 
</P>
<P>
 On the streets of Wrightwood, Garnes is part Andy of Mayberry, part Colombo, 
part McCloud on horseback, a good-old boy who locals say makes the best 
chocolate chip and walnut cookies in town. 
</P>
<P>
 On slow days, and there are many of them at this altitude, he might stop for a 
chat with the folks at the U.S. Forest Service station or the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory outpost, checking in for a cup of coffee at the Mile High cafe in 
nearby Valyermo. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Mile High, a former stagecoach stop that once had a brothel out back, 
where chain saws and snow-shoes now hang from the walls and ceilings, talk 
turns to the time Garnes rousted a 350-pound brown bear that had broken into 
the place for a late-night bite. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used a fire extinguisher to drive him out from under the floorboards," 
Garnes recalled. "Man, did he come roaring out of that hole, all right. He was 
last seen heading south into the mountains with a big 'ol white butt." 
</P>
<P>
 Animals aren't the only wildlife around here. 
</P>
<P>
 Garnes keeps an eye on a character known as Crazy Jim who's been known to 
brandish a weapon, claiming to be an ex-CIA agent. And the hitchhiker who 
travels each weekend from the San Fernando Valley to stand on street corners, 
waving at passersby like some smiling Vegas clown. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the Big Horn mine burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 Several gang members were surprised during a trailer break-in there and were 
being chased by three miners wielding shotguns: "You've got to understand that 
you're not in the big city up here," Garnes said. "People take matters into 
their own hands." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Garnes caught up with the chase, the miners had collared three of 
the thieves but had let one slip away. But on this 9-degree day, Garnes wasn't 
worried. He just sat in his cruiser with the heater running, his three suspects 
handcuffed in the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came a tap on the frosted window. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you the guy I'm looking for?" Garnes asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," came the reply. "Hurry up, get the cuffs. It's cold out here." Lonely 
Patrol 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Bennie Garnes patrols some of the most 
remote and sparsely populated areas in the county. In the winter, he is the 
only officer patrolling a 300-square-mile area. In summer, he and another 
deputy cover 1,000 square miles across the San Gabriel Mountains and Antelope 
Valley.

BACKING OF GOP MAY HELP LITTLE IN RECALL; POLITICS: SOME DOUBT WHETHER 
ENDORSEMENT WILL ADD UP TO MONEY AND VOLUNTEERS IN CAMPAIGN TO OUST SEN. 
ROBERTI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Outgunned financially and often outmaneuvered politically, the recall campaign 
against state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) received a boost recently when 
the movement, relentlessly reviled by Roberti as the creature of gun zealots, 
was embraced by the state Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 The endorsement last Sunday of the recall by a unanimous voice vote at the 
GOP's winter convention would help legitimize their effort, recall organizers 
said hopefully after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is the entire Republican Party run by assault weapons extremists? I don't 
think Roberti can say that," said Russ Howard, a Palos Verdes Estates financial 
consultant and a top strategist for the recall movement. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, Roberti has widely succeeded in marginalizing his foes by painting 
them as little more than a cabal of gun nuts seeking revenge against him 
because he authored a 1989 ban on assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 But some doubt if the GOP endorsement will bear real fruit -- money and 
volunteers -- for the recall or carry much weight with the Republican 
rank-and-file even as a symbolic gesture, because some of the party's top 
leaders, including Gov. Pete Wilson and state Sen. Ken Maddy (R-Fresno), 
distanced themselves from the convention action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be surprised if the party gives them much more than token support," 
predicted Republican-based corporate political consultant Paul Clarke. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the GOP endorsement has not persuaded Roberti or his partisans that 
they are suddenly dealing with a different political animal. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Press, chairman of the state Democratic Party, quickly called the GOP 
endorsement a disgraceful sign that the GOP had climbed into bed with gun 
fanatics who have opposed laws to control the ownership of the kind of assault 
weapons that have figured dramatically in some of the nation's most heinous 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
 Press and Roberti supporters also observed that the resolution adopted by the 
GOP convention was introduced by John Stoos, the Sacramento lobbyist for Gun 
Owners of California, a group organized by former Sen. H.L. Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the recall leadership, the GOP endorsement was a much welcomed boon. 
Although Roberti's foes scored a surprising coup in January when it was learned 
they had gathered the nearly 20,000 signatures needed to force Roberti into a 
recall election, now set for April 12, they have suffered several setbacks 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 One such setback occurred this week when it was disclosed that recall 
organizers were raffling off firearms, including an assault rifle, to raise 
funds for their cause. And the movement is bracing for a media blitz this week 
when gun control celebrity Sarah Brady comes to Los Angeles to defend Roberti. 
Her husband, James Brady, was critically injured in the 1981 assassination 
attempt against President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady, who will hold a news conference with Roberti and be the featured guest 
at a Biltmore Hotel fund-raiser for the embattled senator, was the prime 
sponsor of the new federal gun control law that took effect last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Her efforts locally are designed to elevate Roberti's campaign to a national 
referendum on gun control.  
</P>
<P>
 Facing such formidable odds, the recall organizers have hoped to turn their 
GOP endorsement into solid cash and volunteers in coming days. 
</P>
<P>
 But success in this regard remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should the party waste its time on a recall?" said Clarke, noting that 
term limits will force Roberti to leave his Senate seat in November, anyway. 
The party's energy would be better spent on this year's governor's race and the 
U. S. Senate seat race, Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddy, Senate leader of the GOP caucus, argued at last weekend's convention 
against the party underwriting the recall fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a shortage of funds and should be putting our money into races where 
we have a better chance of winning," Maddy said in an interview this week, 
recapping the arguments he made to the party's board of directors at the 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican prospects in the 20th Senate District -- the seat now held by 
Roberti -- are not bright in large part because GOP voter registration is low, 
Maddy said. Democratic voters outnumber Republicans by nearly a 2-1 margin in 
this district. Maddy further observed that he is leery of "single-issue" 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Wilson, too, has steered wide of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed for his position by reporters at the convention, Wilson praised 
Roberti for his help in passing state budgets, said he was unclear about the 
purpose of the recall and predicted a Roberti victory at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roberti will probably survive the recall," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke warned, too, that even the endorsement is not necessarily a barometer 
of rank-and-file party sentiment. "The convention is composed of people who are 
furthest to the right," Clarke said. "They are not representative of the 
average party member." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Roberti recently claimed that he has significant support among 
Republicans, and Staci Walters, his campaign press secretary, said the senator 
soon will be showing off his GOP supporters at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite the coolness of some of the party's top elected officials to the 
recall, others in the party are gung-ho about defeating one of the Democratic 
party's leaders -- for 13 years Roberti was president pro tempore of the Senate 
-- and a highly visible liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 One of these is Downey businessman Keith McCarthy, chairman of the Los Angeles 
County Republican Central Committee and the person who will be making the pitch 
next week to state party Chairman Tirso del Junco for financial support from 
the GOP's state organization. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy acknowledged in an interview that gun rights advocates are a 
significant part of the recall movement but insisted that the gun issue is not 
why he wants Roberti's ouster. "This is about Roberti's corruption and 
arrogance, not about guns," McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall leaders have damned Roberti as a carpetbagger because he does not live 
in the district and labeled him the "godfather of political corruption" because 
he was leader of the Senate when three of his Democratic colleagues were either 
convicted or pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the biggest political 
corruption scandal in Sacramento in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Although incidents such as the firearms raffle may make his job of securing 
mainline Republican support for the recall more difficult, McCarthy said it 
would not deter him from proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we should sit on our thumbs and let an opportunity like this go 
by to elect a Republican," he said.

SCOTT HARRIS: BERNARDI MAY HAVE A STAR, BUT NOT FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I walk up and down this street and there are people who shouldn't be here," 
Jeff Schubert complained. "And I can't even get an audition!" 
</P>
<P>
 Schubert is a 26-year-old actor from Manhattan who came to Hollywood to chase 
his dreams. The street is Hollywood Boulevard. The "people who shouldn't be 
here" are, in Schubert's view, the no-talents and obscure names who somehow got 
a star on the Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 He said this as he was standing beside the new star that honors Ernani 
Bernardi, the former city councilman from the Valley who made a name for 
himself as a Big Band musician long before he entered politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never heard of him," Schubert said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's remarkable how many people uttered those same four words the other day as 
I hailed passers-by at Bernardi's star. Serving a record 32 years on the City 
Council won't make you famous in this town. 
</P>
<P>
 I tried to set people straight. And in the end, one tourist declared that 
Ernani Bernardi, whoever he is, is "cool." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the word cool doesn't usually come up when the subject is Ernani 
Bernardi. Before he retired from the City Council last year, Bernardi was 
famous for being feisty and irascible. Bernardi, now recovering from a recent 
heart attack at age 82, never thought it was politically incorrect to be a 
hot-blooded Italian. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends loved to describe Bernardi as "the conscience of the council." To 
others, he was just a naysayer. If the vote was 14 to 1, he was the 1. 
</P>
<P>
 One former constituent told me once how Bernardi angrily stalked out of a 
public hearing over what seems a minor point of contention. So this Valley 
politico didn't endear himself to everyone. On the other hand, you don't get 
reelected for three decades without doing something right. 
</P>
<P>
 At City Hall, he was anything but cool. But to be on the Walk of Fame, to be 
one of those names that most people don't recognize -- yeah, there is something 
cool about that. 
</P>
<P>
 His star is just east of La Brea, on the south side of Hollywood Boulevard. I 
queried about 10 passers-by. Not one recognized his name. But, as Schubert 
suggests, that puts Bernardi in a rather large company. 
</P>
<P>
 Take this quiz. The Walk of Fame was begun in 1958 with the unveiling of eight 
stars honoring motion picture performers. Match the first name in left column 
to the appropriate last name on the right. The correct answers will be at the 
end of this article. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward: Borden 
</P>
<P>
 Joanne: Colman 
</P>
<P>
 Olive: Lancaster 
</P>
<P>
 Ernst: Fazenda 
</P>
<P>
 Burt: Sedgewick 
</P>
<P>
 Louise: Torrence 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald: Woodward 
</P>
<P>
 Preston: Foster 
</P>
<P>
 So, you see? Ernani Bernardi fits right in. 
</P>
<P>
 I hung out at his star for about 30 minutes. Well, OK, it was more like 20 
minutes. Goodness knows how long I would have had to stay before someone could 
(a) simply recognize the name, (b) place him in Los Angeles history and (c) 
explain why he merits a star. 
</P>
<P>
 There are essentially two reasons why. 
</P>
<P>
 One is that, even before he got into politics, Bernardi was a bona fide 
entertainer. In the Big Band era, "Noni" Bernardi, as he was known then, made a 
name for himself with the alto saxophone. He wasn't an amateur like Bill 
Clinton. Bernardi was a pro who played with the likes of Benny Goodman, Tommy 
Dorsey and Lionel Hampton. Bernardi did the orchestration on one of Hampton's 
hits. And for a time, Bernardi fronted his own band. 
</P>
<P>
 The other reason is politics. As a way of honoring Bernardi, Council President 
John Ferraro nominated his old paisano for a star on a block being revitalized 
by the Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA). 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Bernardi has long been the CRA's harshest critic -- and the CRA 
paid for Bernardi's star. Bernardi reviled the agency and complained that it 
diverted public money to private interests. Even now, Bernardi is suing the 
agency over some alleged shenanigans behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, the installation fees for Walk of Fame stars are paid by studios 
eager to promote a new film or recording. It isn't clear when Bernardi became 
aware that the CRA was paying for his star. His family, I'm told, has requested 
"no phone calls, no politics" during his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 It's known that, at the installation ceremony Feb. 1, Bernardi was handed a 
press release explaining the CRA's role. Bernardi didn't complain, but it's 
possible he was distracted. 
</P>
<P>
 On that same day, on that same block, Sophia Loren got her star. 
</P>
<P>
 "She looked pretty good," an appreciative Bernardi later told a friend. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Not many people had time to chat. You can't blame them. Was I really a 
reporter with a job to do -- or just another weirdo on Hollywood Boulevard? 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis and Karen Lyons, tourists from Perth, Australia, wearing identical 
electric blue sunglasses, were an exception. They found the Walk of Fame 
amusing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're putting people here who don't belong," Dennis complained. "John Tesh! 
John Tesh has a star! He's not a star!" 
</P>
<P>
 Devotees of Entertainment Tonight may disagree. As for Bernardi, I explained 
that he used to play with Goodman and Hampton, whose own star is just a block 
away, next to Louis Armstrong's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I know who Lionel Hampton is," Dennis said. "He's terrific!" 
</P>
<P>
 Then he looked down at Bernardi's star.  
</P>
<P>
 "If he played with Hampton," Dennis said, "he's cool."

you actually knew a couple more than Lancaster, Woodward and Colman, consider 
yourself a film buff. If you knew all eight, get a life.)

GOVERNMENT WON'T COVER ALL LOSSES; ASSISTANCE: OFFICIALS CAUTION THAT LOANS AND 
GRANTS OFFERED THROUGH FEDERAL AND STATE SOURCES ARE NOT INTENDED TO SERVE AS 
INSURANCE PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As more and more applications for federal and state disaster assistance are 
processed, victims of the Northridge earthquake are finding out that not 
everything they lost may be replaced with a government loan or grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Although you might qualify for a loan to replace your big-screen television, 
you won't get the money to replace your mink coat. And while you could borrow 
money to replace your Noritake china, you won't get a grant to replace 
grandma's antique Minton place settings. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't qualify for a Small Business Administration loan, expect even 
less. Under the state Individual and Family Grant Program, if you lost a 
cherrywood dinette set, for instance, be prepared to accept a dining table with 
a Formica top. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government programs are not intended to be an insurance program," said 
Rita Kepner, a spokeswoman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. "Part 
of the disappointment of many people is that they are not going to get all 
these things without having bought any insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, government officials encourage those who suffered damage or losses as a 
result of the Jan. 17 temblor to register with FEMA for assistance before the 
March 18 deadline -- which is set 60 days after the President's disaster 
declaration -- though it may be extended. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what your situation is, you should apply," said Rick Jenkins, a 
spokesman for the SBA. "You just don't know for what you qualify. Get into the 
system and see what kind of help is available." 
</P>
<P>
 There are both state and federal programs to assist all levels of victims, 
from those who simply suffered cracks on the wall and broken dishes, to those 
displaced by the quake and left jobless. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who have become unemployed as a result of the earthquake, including 
those self-employed, there is a state program that provides weekly benefit 
payments. If someone was left unemployed by the quake, and thus is facing a 
foreclosure on their house, they may qualify for a grant that will pay the 
mortgage until work is found. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA's Disaster Housing Assistance Program provides immediate grants to 
individuals whose homes have become uninhabitable or to those who need start-up 
funds to make their homes habitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to give you a little bit of money and get you back into the 
house," FEMA's Kepner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most victims will be referred to the SBA, which despite its name also provides 
loans to homeowners and renters in areas declared disasters by the President. 
SBA may provide loans as high as $200,000 for structural damage to a residence 
and $40,000 for personal property losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Business owners may receive loans as high as $1.5 million, and may also 
qualify for a second program called Economic Injury Loans, which provide 
working capital for companies hurt financially by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins said that even people who can pay for repairs with savings or credit 
cards may be eligible for a low-interest loan because depleting savings or 
paying a high interest rate could be considered financial hardships. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins said SBA loans can be used to pay for the replacement of most personal 
property, except luxury items. For instance, money to replace a Joan Miro 
lithograph would not be provided, but a loan would be available to buy a 
painting to go over the couch. An antique vase would have to be replaced with a 
"functional" vase, according to Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, auto insurance benefits must be used to repair any quake damage to a 
vehicle, but SBA loans may be used to pay the deductible or if the vehicle is 
underinsured. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's Individual and Family Grant Program is seen as one of the last 
resort assistance programs for victims who do not qualify for a loan. The 
program is designed to replace only those items deemed necessary for everyday 
life. So while the program considers a television essential, it will provide 
only for a standard set and does not consider a videocassette recorder a 
necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 If within a five-bedroom house, for instance, only three of the bedrooms were 
used for sleeping, the program would provide funds to refurbish only those 
three rooms. The other two are not covered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not an insurance or replacement program," said Ben Dew, a spokesman 
for the IFGP. "We look only at the necessities a person needs to live."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; LAWYERS QUESTION GRAND JURY MAKEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Defense attorneys in a Thousand Oaks death-penalty case have told a judge that 
they want to examine the racial and ethnic composition of the grand jury that 
returned a murder indictment against their client. 
</P>
<P>
 The public defenders are questioning whether the Ventura County Grand Jury, 
which indicted Mark Scott Thornton in December, fairly represented minorities 
in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath scheduled a hearing 
April 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say Thornton, 19, kidnaped and fatally shot Kellie O'Sullivan, the 
mother of a young boy, on Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Susan R. Olson said her office has requested statistics 
on the racial and ethnic makeup of members who have served on the grand jury 
over the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson's co-counsel, Deputy Public Defender Howard Asher, said defense 
attorneys want to see whether there is a "systematic exclusion for racial 
minorities" on the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, the attorneys said, Thornton's indictment could be thrown out or 
prosecutors would at least have to refile charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorneys said the fact that both the defendant and the victim in the 
O'Sullivan case are white is irrelevant. They said Thornton was entitled to 
have a grand jury that is representative of the county hear testimony against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael K. Frawley said prosecutors do not expect the 
defense attorneys' inquiry to turn up anything that could result in Thornton's 
indictment being thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury -- an arm of the government -- is a 19-member citizens panel 
chosen by lot from a pool selected by Superior Court judges. DWAYNE BRAY

EARTHQUAKE / THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; INTERNATIONAL VISITORS LOOK FOR THE LESSONS 
IN L.A.'S DISASTER; AFTERMATH: GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS COME TO STUDY HOW FEDERAL, 
STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES RESPONDED AFTER THE TEMBLOR. 
</P>

<P>
 The quick response and coordinated effort by federal, state and local 
government officials to provide assistance to victims of the Northridge 
earthquake has drawn the attention of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, government officials from Canada, Korea, Germany, France, 
Argentina, Chile and Taiwan have visited disaster relief centers and earthquake 
damage sites to study the way officials here have responded to the emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are observing what we are doing here to see if they can use any of it in 
their countries," said Fred Messick, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of 
Emergency Services, which jointly manages Earthquake Service Centers with the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, a group from India is scheduled to visit with both OES and FEMA 
officials to exchange information about earthquake preparedness and 
post-disaster assistance. Last September in India, the rural area of Killari 
experienced a magnitude 6.4 quake, which killed nearly 30,000 people. The 
6.8-magnitude Northridge quake Jan. 17 resulted in 57 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, 30 government officials from Japan visited an Earthquake Service 
Center in Chatsworth. They represent Japan's ministries of health and welfare, 
transport, posts and telecommunications and construction, as well as Japan's 
Fire Defense Agency, National Land Agency, Science and Technology Agency and 
National Police Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Yukihiko Sumiyoshi of Japan's Ministry of Construction explained that the 
group arrived in Los Angeles on Tuesday for a one-week stay. From here, the 
group will travel to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese officials visited the collapsed Santa Monica Freeway, the crushed 
Northridge Meadows Apartments building, the devastation along Ventura Boulevard 
in Sherman Oaks and a destroyed mobile home park in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 Before last week's tour of the service center, the group was briefed by a 
Small Business Administration representative, a psychologist and a FEMA 
earthquake mitigation expert. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitors appeared to be fascinated by the cooperative effort of the 
different federal, state and local agencies, all housed in the service center. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you share all the people?" asked one man. 
</P>
<P>
 Koji Miura of the Ministry of Health and Welfare said that Japan does not have 
a coordinated effort similar to FEMA's, but that it could work in his country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are learning about what the people in California are doing," Miura said. 
"It is very interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 Another man was confused about the transition from Disaster Assistance Centers 
to Earthquake Service Centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You do this only for earthquakes?" he asked. "What about hurricanes?" 
</P>
<P>
 It was explained that DACs are set up to assist victims in applying for 
government aid in all major disasters. Then, service centers provide follow-up 
help for those who have applied for help at a DAC. In this case, earthquake was 
added to the service centers' name because that was the local disaster, 
officials explained. 
</P>
<P>
 After the tour, the Japanese delegation appeared impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very good service for the people," Sumiyoshi said. "The government 
agencies work hard and quickly to help the people."

MAN IN CRITICAL CONDITION AFTER SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 18-year-old man was in critical condition Saturday after he was shot during 
an argument that erupted at a Sylmar residence, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police arrested a 25-year-old Los Angeles man on suspicion of 
attempted murder.Authorities refused to name the alleged shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, Randy Cooper, also of Los Angeles, was taken to Holy Cross Medical 
Center in Mission Hills after the 9:40 p.m. shooting Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Cooper and the suspect were among a group of young men and women who had 
gathered at a residence in the 14100 block of Foothill Boulevard, Lt. Joseph 
Garcia of the LAPD's Foothill Division said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper was shot in the upper body after he and the suspect argued. Police said 
they do not know why the two argued. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect was arrested at the scene and the gun used in the shooting was 
recovered, authorities said.

VOTERS EDGY OVER CRIME ISSUE; ELECTIONS: A SERIES OF WELL-PUBLICIZED KILLINGS 
ALARMS TORRANCE RESIDENTS. ISSUE DOMINATES MAYORAL, COUNCIL CAMPAIGNS. 
</P>

<P>
 When Torrance City Council candidate Marcia Cribbs walks the precincts, she 
often speaks to residents through peepholes, screen doors, intercoms, even 
fences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you cannot even see them," Cribbs said. "They'll say, before they 
open the door, 'Who are you?' They are afraid to open the door." 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates are coming back from precinct walks with similar stories. 
Crime, or at least the fear of it, they say, is No. 1 on the list of voters' 
concerns. As a consequence, the issue has dominated campaigning for the Tuesday 
City Council and mayoral elections, even though the candidates' stands on the 
issue and solutions to the problem sound much the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters will choose among two candidates for mayor, 11 candidates for three 
council seats and three candidates for city clerk. City Treasurer Linda Barnett 
is running unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
 As in other middle-class communities nationwide, crime has hit home, or at 
least uncomfortably close to home, in Torrance. Well-publicized shootings at 
Del Amo Fashion Center and the Redondo Beach Galleria, followed by the slayings 
of a Manhattan Beach police officer, the daughter of an El Segundo councilman 
and two Palos Verdes Estates police officers, have forced candidates to try to 
come up with solutions, even if their city faces another year of budget 
constraints.  
</P>
<P>
 "More and more, people have heard of or know victims of a crime," said City 
Council candidate Mike Mauno. "Crime is everywhere, and people are realizing it 
is everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The Torrance Police Department reports that crime rose 4% last year. Except 
for a 2% drop in 1992, crime in the city has risen 4% every year since 1988, 
according to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest percentage increase in violent crime was in the number of 
homicides: from three in 1992 to 10 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But the number of rapes dropped 14%, and robberies dropped 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may just be the perception or fear of crime," said Torrance Police Officer 
Don Sherwood. "But if it is the perception, it may just as well be the real 
thing. We have got to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 One crime that raised the level of fear among residents occurred in a shopping 
mall. In March, Michael Ellis, 21, an employee of Aladdin's Castle, was shot to 
death in a robbery at the popular Del Amo Fashion Center arcade. The assailant 
was not caught, and the incident prompted police to beef up patrols at the 
sprawling retail center. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months later, an intruder entered a couple's north Torrance home through 
an unlocked door, tied up Lynn Finzel, 28, and assaulted her. When her husband, 
Joseph Finzel, entered the room, the assailant shot him to death. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailant then shot Lynn Finzel, who survived. Randy Eugene Garcia, 22, of 
Oregon, was arrested and charged in the attack.  
</P>
<P>
 Area residents' nerves had been frayed since April, 1992, when riots in Los 
Angeles spilled over into nearby Inglewood. Since then, gun stores all over the 
South Bay have reported a sharp rise in business. Sharpshooter Range in 
Torrance had trouble keeping guns and ammunition in stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents have installed screen doors made of heavy metal, which are 
difficult to punch through. In the Hollywood Riviera, a high-income beachfront 
area of the city, many residents have installed motion detector lights. 
</P>
<P>
 "You walk down the street, and lights follow you," said Glenn Tanner, a member 
of the homeowners association. He said heightened concern about crime is 
prevalent throughout the neighborhood.  
</P>
<P>
 Torrance residents are not alone. The percentage of Americans who put crime 
issues at the top of the nation's problems jumped from 21% in June to 43% last 
month, a Los Angeles Times poll shows. Violent crime actually dropped by 3% 
nationally in the first six months of 1993, according to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Torrance area may be relatively safe, officials still are 
grappling with issues that a decade ago were associated only with urban areas.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was a real concern when people started seeing kids wearing gang attire 
at the mall," said Councilwoman Dee Hardison, who is running for mayor. "It 
made them nervous. . . . We used to think it was (another city's) gangs. But 
that is no longer necessarily the case. They're here." 
</P>
<P>
 Said her opponent, Councilman Bill Applegate: "You have to ask yourself, 'Why 
do we have parks if we can't use them safely, or libraries, or our own homes?' 
If you can't feel safe, nothing else is relevant." Other candidates have spoken 
out on the issue, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Applegate and council candidate Dan Walker were the only candidates endorsed 
by the Torrance Police Officers Assn., although, according to the latest 
campaign finance statements, the group contributed $250 to Joe Martinez, $150 
to Joe Quinones and $250 to Mike Botello -- all of them council candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates are promoting expanded Neighborhood Watch programs, police reserves 
and more volunteer help for the department. The additional eyes and ears, 
candidates say, will help spot problems before they get out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't hired Wyatt Earp to take care of it, so it means you have to 
expect Neighborhood Watch or community-based policing," Botello said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some candidates want to take community-based policing a step further. At a 
recent candidates' debate, Mauno suggested the formation of a Public Safety 
Advisory Committee, and candidate Burton Fletcher made a similar proposal for a 
police commission. Both bodies would respond to residents' concerns about the 
Police Department and crime in their neighborhoods.

THE GLOBAL CLASSROOM; CHILDREN BEGIN LANGUAGE IMMERSION PROGRAMS IN 
KINDERGARTEN

 Principal Stephen Martinez tiptoed into the Farragut Elementary School 
kindergarten classroom in Culver City, trying not to be noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't work.  
</P>
<P>
 Hearing him, the students -- whites, Latinos, African Americans and Asian 
Americans -- jumped up, faced Martinez, bowed deeply, and greeted him in a 
singsong chorus with " Ohayo Gozaimasu Martinez Sensei ." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez grinned, bowed, and replied "Ohayo Gozaimasu."  
</P>
<P>
 The formalities over, the children sat back on the floor, cross-legged in rows 
marked by strips of colored tape on the rug. 
</P>
<P>
 Red and blue construction paper folded into shapes of birds and elephants, 
called origami , were pinned to a corkboard. On a wall nearby was a clock with 
Japanese Kanji characters instead of Arabic numerals, and a photo of Japan's 
royal family. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez sat down to observe, and teacher Naomi Kawano resumed her lesson, 
reading aloud to her students in Japanese a tale about a dog and cat who become 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The children sat in rapt attention, appearing to understand her every word. 
</P>
<P>
 Farragut is one of about 150 elementary schools nationwide that "immerses" 
children in foreign languages ranging from Spanish and French to Japanese and 
Korean. The idea, say educators, is to start teaching second languages to kids 
when they are eager 5-year-olds, not when they're 16 -- and less willing to 
learn. 
</P>
<P>
 And rather than taking a single language class that meets for an hour a day, 
students in immersion programs actually do course work -- history, social 
studies, math -- in a second language. 
</P>
<P>
 Such learning has taken root on the Westside, which is served by three of the 
45 school districts statewide that have language immersion programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City Unified launched the country's first Spanish immersion program in 
1971. Now the district has a K-5 Spanish immersion curriculum and a newly 
launched kindergarten through second-grade Japanese immersion program, which 
serve 300 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified has three Korean and four Spanish immersion programs in 
elementary schools, with one of the Spanish programs at Grand View Elementary 
in Mar Vista serving 146 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica/Malibu Unified offers K-8 Spanish immersion courses and next fall 
plans to add ninth-grade Spanish-language courses in physical science, 
humanities and algebra to its foreign immersion track, which now serves 405 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 The rationale offered for such programs is that Americans must learn to 
communicate in other tongues in an era of growing economic and cultural 
interdependence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're deficient in our collective knowledge of other languages and other 
cultures," said Russell Campbell, a professor of linguistics at UCLA who helped 
design Culver City's program 23 years ago. Language immersion, he says, 
produces "kids who can use other languages in the real world, and who can be a 
benefit to society." 
</P>
<P>
 Immersion usually begins in kindergarten. In the early grades students are 
taught almost exclusively in a second language so that by second and third 
grade they are reading and writing in it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Culver City and Santa Monica programs only 20 minutes a day is spent on 
English instruction in kindergarten, but that amount increases as students 
progress to higher grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth- and fifth-graders at El Rincon Elementary in Culver City and Edison 
Elementary in Santa Monica spend half their school day learning in Spanish and 
half in English. Culver City students who make it through the K-5 Spanish 
immersion curriculum can go on to take a Spanish language arts course in middle 
school and an advanced Spanish language course at Culver City High. 
</P>
<P>
 Young children, though generally less inhibited than older students when 
learning a second language, still face hurdles in mastering another tongue. 
Learning to write the complicated Kanji alphabet -- one of three Japanese 
alphabets -- poses a special challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "(It's) a meticulous process," said Kawano. "Their motor skills are not as 
developed yet, so they go through a process of repetition." 
</P>
<P>
 But immersion veterans say their intensive early instruction made learning in 
another language far easier in higher grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayanna Bledsoe, an eighth-grader at John Adams Middle School in Santa Monica, 
says one of her toughest assignments recently was "no big deal," thanks to the 
earlier immersion courses she took as a youngster.

 "We had to read 'Don Quixote,' in Spanish," said Bledsoe, 13, a native English 
speaker. "Then we had to do a book report in Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
 She helps her younger sister, a fifth-grader at Edison Elementary, with her 
Spanish homework. And the pair use their new language for some extracurricular 
communicating at home. Nothing, Bledsoe says, beats dishing some chisme 
(gossip) in Spanish within earshot of their mother, who speaks only English. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers in the Culver City and Santa Monica school districts say many 
immersion students approach foreign language programs as Bledsoe does -- a 
challenge that is fun at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, however, some parents worry that immersion classes might put their 
children at a disadvantage when it comes time to do English-language 
schoolwork. 
</P>
<P>
 For Diana Bulgatz, that concern proved short-lived. Bulgatz acknowledges she 
had some qualms when she enrolled her daughter, Heidi, in Culver City's Spanish 
immersion program in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friends asked, 'Aren't you worried that it's going to ruin her English?' " 
recalled Bulgatz. But she decided to try the program anyway.

 Edwardh, an assistant coach with the Warriors' football team, takes over for 
Robin Davis, who had a record of 29-24 in three seasons. He is unsure of what 
to expect from this season's squad. "Everything is a question mark for us," 
Edwardh said. "I know some of the kids from the football team, but I really 
don't know about their strengths as baseball players yet." Edwardh does know 
what he can expect from Aguilar, who batted .380 last season. A skilled 
fielder, Aguilar was a first-team all-league selection. "He's a hard worker," 
Edwardh said. "He'll set the tone for the team." The Warriors might have 
pitching problems. They lost the nucleus of their staff to graduation and do 
not have many experienced pitchers. Dybas, impressive in relief as a sophomore, 
might earn a starting spot in the rotation. "I've liked what I've seen from 
him," Edwardh said. SCHEDULE

 Walters, an assistant coach at Calvary Chapel for five seasons, replaces Dale 
Walker. "I'm real excited," Walters said. "I think we'll be competitive and 
contend for the league title if we can avoid any additional injuries." The 
Eagles suffered a major loss before the season's opening pitch, when they 
learned sophomore pitcher Kenny Nash would not play this season. Nash, who was 
projected as the No. 1 starter, will have surgery on his right shoulder. Even 
without Nash, Hamilton, Herr and Jones could form the foundation of a solid 
pitching staff. They will all receive help from King, who is one of the 
league's top catchers and a three-year starter. Walters is counting on Elliott 
to anchor the infield. SCHEDULE

 Gaunt waited patiently for this opportunity, serving as an assistant to former 
Coach Jeff Zippi the last six seasons. He takes the reins of a program that is 
struggling. Gaunt, however, is optimistic the Eagles will rebound from two 
consecutive disappointing seasons in which they were 7-36. "We should win our 
share of games," Gaunt said. "We lost some very good defensive outfielders, but 
we still should be strong on defense." Gaunt believes Watts is among the 
league's best catchers. He has a strong arm and is sound defensively. Bishop 
and Davenport are being counted on to provide a standout double-play 
combination. Biniasz showed promise last season and is expected to battle for 
the starting job at third base. Pitching is not expected to be among the 
Eagles' strengths. "We're very, very short on pitching," Gaunt said. "We're 
looking at a lot of people." Gaunt hopes Jeff Jennings can help on the pitching 
front. Jennings has pitching experience, but he is better suited to contribute 
in the outfield. SCHEDULE

 Pressman showed he still has the winning touch. After a six-year absence from 
coaching, he led a mediocre Lancer team to a second-place finish. In his 
previous coaching position at Van Nuys Montclair Prep, Pressman guided the 
Mounties to four Southern Section titles from 1975-87. "We were real close to 
winning (the league championship) last year," Pressman said. "I really didn't 
think we were going to be a very good team initially, to be completely honest 
about it, but we had about five or six guys who really developed." Heading the 
list was Reiland, who was a second-team all-league pick despite limited 
experience at catcher. Cavaness and Howard also performed well as juniors. They 
both might earn starting spots in the rotation and share duties at first base.

 Randall is pleased by the success former Herald pitcher Ila Borders, the 
second woman to pitch in a collegiate baseball game, has enjoyed at Southern 
California College. Randall, however, would still like to have Borders on the 
mound for Whittier Christian. He believes the Heralds will score runs in 
bunches -- but they might surrender even more. "We could win a lot of 9-8 
ballgames," Randall said. "But we also could lose some that way." Jordan throws 
several pitches and has a strong arm, but struggles with control. Jordan's 
biggest contribution should come on offense. As a sophomore, he batted .475 to 
lead the team and had 14 runs batted in. Meyers showed promise pitching last 
season, but he has limited experience. The pitching staff will benefit from the 
presence of Alcala, who was a first-team all-league pick as a junior. SCHEDULE

 The Minutemen have been a league power under Clifton, who enters his 10th 
season at the team's controls. This season should be no different. "Catching 
and defense will be our strengths," Clifton said. "Our hitting will be fine and 
we've got a lot of talent and depth in the outfield." Malcom was a standout as 
a sophomore starter, batting .377 with 15 runs batted in. He also did a sound 
job defensively and was a first-team all-league selection. Davis started as a 
freshman and progressed with each game, batting .259 with 17 RBIs. Warmack 
(.298, seven RBIs) provides leadership in the infield. Clifton likes his 
outfield defense because of Rule and Winters. The Minutemen should have a 
young, quality pitching staff, anchored by Cook and Hardin. "The question for 
us," Clifton said, "is how quickly our pitching will develop." SCHEDULE

 St. Michael's has won only four games in 11 seasons. Dignan does not expect a 
major turnaround this season with a roster composed primarily of freshmen and 
sophomores. "Basically, we're starting from scratch again," Dignan said. "I'd 
be totally elated if we could get the third spot in league, but I really don't 
know if that can happen." Any success for St. Michael's depends on the play of 
De La Riva and Sanchez. Both won starting positions early last season and 
became team leaders despite being freshmen. "They've both played a lot of 
baseball," Dignan said. "They're keys for us." Jimenez is another key. He is 
the only senior with experience. Sanchez, the starting third baseman, probably 
also will earn a spot in the starting rotation, where he could be joined by 
either Lin or Tucker. Dignan is considering among a number of options at 
catcher, second base and in the outfield. SCHEDULE

 Esposito has another experienced, talented team. Southern California Christian 
finished second in the Arrowhead League last season and should challenge for 
the league championship this time around. "This season looks very promising," 
Esposito said. "We have everyone returning from last season and several quality 
pitchers." Caballero, Felten and St. Clair were first-team all-league 
selections. Caballero is the league's top catcher. St. Clair and Felten have 
strong arms and are defensive standouts in the outfield. Their versatility

 Although Huntington Beach Claremont did not have a particularly good record, 
Whitman's first season at the Cougars' controls can be viewed as a success. 
Claremont's roster was composed primarily of freshmen and sophomores who gained 
valuable experience. The on-the-job training produced many tough moments, but 
it could help the Cougars enjoy success this season. Only a few players on this 
season's team lack at least some knowledge of how things work at the varsity 
level. Kimble is the best of the bunch. His hitting progressed well and he made 
many good plays at third base. He figures to be even better this season. Hazan 
is the leader of the pitching staff. He is a three-year starter with a strong 
arm and a variety of pitches. He becomes stronger as the game goes along. 
What's more, Hazan provides Whitman with some flexibility because he can also 
play third base. Peacock was a pleasant surprise at shortstop. He was forced 
into the starting lineup because of an injury to the projected starter, but he 
more than held his own. His slick fielding at times provided bright spots for 
the Cougars. SCHEDULE

 This is the first coaching position for Smith, who has spent the previous 
three years in the St. Louis Cardinals' organization. Smith is eager to share 
his baseball knowledge. "I feel confident that I can teach the guys something," 
Smith said. "I think we will be sound fundamentally." Heritage Christian has 
several experienced, skilled players back from last season's Express League 
championship team. Smith believes Heritage Christian has the talent to defend 
its title. Carreon is the team's leader. He was a first-team all-league 
selection and is the league's top defensive catcher. Acheson, Cortez and Scott 
Smith might composee a formidable pitching staff. Smith also believes his team 
will have no problem scoring runs. "Our bats are going to be good," he said. 
"How we pitch is the key." SCHEDULE

 Chapman paid his dues for several years as the junior varsity coach at La 
Quinta and an assistant varsity coach at Dana Hills. He will learn the joys and 
hardships of building a program from scratch in his first season as a varsity 
head coach. "This is going to be a good learning experience," Chapman said. 
"Being a new school and a new program, we have a lot of things to figure out. 
It's going to take some time, but we'll get there." The Wolverines are without 
a home playing field and a league this season. Aliso Niguel will become a 
member of the Pacific Coast League in 1995. Until then, however, Chapman said 
scheduling games will be difficult. "It's been a nightmare finding games. I 
wish we had more, but we'll just have to learn as much as possible with the 
ones we could get." Chapman was pleased when more than 100 students attended 
tryouts for the varsity and lower-level teams. Redwan and Shea figure to be the 
top players this season. SCHEDULE

WESTSIDE WATCH: GET READY FOR 'LEGENDS OF HOLLYWOOD -- THE SEQUEL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Humphrey Bogart stood on a wall, but had a great fall. Now all of his pieces 
and those of some of his famous friends will be put together again. 
</P>
<P>
 A 75-foot-long mural featuring the larger-than-life likenesses of Bogart, 
Marilyn Monroe, Fred Astaire, Bette Davis, Clark Gable and James Dean came 
tumbling down during the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Now two local arts groups plan to sell remnants of the 1983 Hollywood 
landmark, called "Legends of Hollywood," in order to fund its repainting by the 
original artist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of the fiber of Hollywood," said Nyla Arslanian, president of the 
Hollywood Arts Council. "It's known worldwide. It was a big loss." 
</P>
<P>
 The mural was painted by Eloy Torrez on a two-story facade attached to a brick 
building by a metal frame. The quake ripped the frame from the building, 
dropping the mural to the sidewalk, said Bill Lasarow, president of the Mural 
Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Several pieces of Davis, Dean and Gable were pocketed by fans in the days 
after the quake because the figures fell face up, exposing the artwork. 
However, Bogart, Monroe and Astaire fell face down on the sidewalk and were 
passed over as debris. 
</P>
<P>
 "With James Dean and Bette Davis, the figures were left, but the faces were 
decimated," Lasarow said. "With Gable, the whole thing was picked away." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 CLIFFHANGER: A high-profile victim of the Northridge earthquake was a landmark 
mansion atop the bluffs at Chautauqua Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway. Its 
master bedroom, study, and portions of its roof tumbled off the cliff, sliding 
to within 100 feet of the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The home, often referred to mistakenly as the "Charles Laughton House"(the 
actor actually lived six residences up the street), has since been demolished. 
But a jumble of debris from it is still clinging near the top of the bluff, 
becoming a sword of Damocles. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting hold of the wreckage from above hasn't been possible: The city has 
prohibited the contractors from placing their equipment within 40 feet of the 
edge of the bluff. Engineers are now seeing if they can tackle the problem from 
the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 But that, too, could prove tricky: They're worried the falling debris might 
come down on workers, said Brian McRae, spokesperson for the city's Public 
Works Department. Said McRae: "It's a real bad deal any way you look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 QUAKE CAMPAIGN: The Jan. 17 earthquake also had a big impact on state Sen. Tom 
Hayden, even though he was 3,000 miles away meeting with President Clinton and 
Vice President Al Gore when it struck. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Democrat called the 6.8 temblor the "final factor" in his 
decision to seek his party's gubernatorial nomination. Hayden also made seismic 
safety the subject of his campaign's second full-page New York Times 
advertisement, issuing a call for a range of measures aimed at preventing 
damage from future quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't blame nature for earthquake damage, blame official neglect," is the 
white-on-black headline of the ad, which ran in the paper's Western Edition on 
Feb. 25.

TOIL AND TROUBLE; EMPLOYMENT: DAY LABORERS SAY THEY ONLY WANT TO MAKE AN HONEST 
LIVING, BUT SOME MERCHANTS AND RESIDENTS WANT THEM BANISHED. THE CONFLICT IN 
LADERA HEIGHTS HAS PROMPTED AN EFFORT TO RESTRICT JOB SEEKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Dawn has barely broken, but Pedro Ortiz is already at his regular spot, hoping 
to be among the lucky few picked up for work that day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a week since his last job, yet the day laborer says he has little 
choice but to keep returning to the Ladera Heights street corner. He has a wife 
and three children to feed, and he has been unable to land a regular job. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvadoran immigrant is one of dozens of men who gather daily near the 
HomeBase home improvement store at Slauson and Fairfax avenues. Like fans 
spotting their favorite star, the men rush each vehicle that pulls over, 
competing for the day's prize -- a chance to earn $20 to $50 for anything from 
cutting grass to busting concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene is repeated every day at street corners and vacant lots across 
Central Los Angeles and the Westside, where hundreds of predominantly Latino 
immigrants satisfy a steady demand for cheap labor. But their presence has also 
fueled controversy and resentment. 
</P>
<P>
 At sites from Atlantic Boulevard in East Los Angeles to Pico Boulevard in West 
Los Angeles, residents and business owners complain about what they say are 
unruly laborers. Nowhere has the conflict been more intense than in Ladera 
Heights, where the complaints prompted a proposed county ordinance that would 
ban day laborers from many sidewalks and streets in unincorporated areas of Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladera Heights residents say the workers litter the area, urinate in public, 
gamble, obstruct traffic and harass women. About 200 residents showed up at a 
community meeting last year that was held to "take back" the neighborhood from 
day laborers. 
</P>
<P>
 The day laborers and their advocates counter that the workers' behavior has 
been blown out of proportion and that they are being unfairly blamed for the 
actions of a few bad apples. They charge that some of the criticism is 
motivated by racism and intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We come here because we have to," said Ortiz, 26, who added that day laborers 
do the jobs that many others refuse to do. "We have a right to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ordinance was introduced last year by county Supervisor Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke, whose 1st District includes Ladera Heights. Under the 
measure, which the Board of Supervisors is expected to consider Tuesday, day 
laborers would be prohibited from soliciting work on public rights-of-way 
within 500 feet of churches, schools or residential areas. The ban would also 
apply to commercial parking lots, although it could be waived if a property 
owner authorizes day laborers to use the area. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 immigrant-rights activists gathered at Burke's Inglewood field office 
last week to protest the proposed ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 American Civil Liberties Union attorneys have vowed to challenge the ordinance 
in court on the ground that it would violate state and federal constitutional 
rights to work and solicit employment. The ACLU, in the 2nd District Court of 
Appeal, is already challenging an Agoura Hills law that prohibits day laborers 
from soliciting work on public thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
 The day labor phenomenon has its roots in the decades-old California tradition 
of relying on inexpensive Latin American labor, which dates back to the bracero 
program of the 1940s, said David Hayes-Bautista, director of the Alta 
California Research Center, a Los Angeles think tank that studies Latino 
issues. Under that program, thousands of Mexican citizens were brought to the 
state to work the fields during the growing season. Hayes-Bautista said day 
laborers began appearing in rural areas in the early 1960s and had spread to 
urban communities by the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Located between Baldwin Hills and Inglewood, Ladera Heights is an affluent, 
largely African American community known for its spacious hillside homes and 
sweeping views of the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz and other day laborers, who work two or three days in a good week, 
gather in the HomeBase parking lot because the flow of customers guarantees 
prospective patrones (bosses) looking for workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not want welfare. I want work," Ortiz said as he pulled his jacket 
collar over his neck, guarding against a cold morning wind. Laid off two years 
ago from a Carson factory, Ortiz was the first person at the HomeBase site that 
day, arriving shortly after 6 a.m. Within two hours, he was joined by about 30 
other men, mostly immigrants from El Salvador and Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 a.m., a gray BMW pulled into the parking lot. Out stepped a 
mustachioed man who identified himself as Mikio, a Ladera Heights resident, 
offering $5 an hour to scrape and paint his home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six dollars! Seven dollars!" shouted about half a dozen workers. Mikio 
remained firm, and only one worker jumped into the car. 
</P>
<P>
 About seven hours after the day began, only five laborers had landed jobs. The 
rest, including Ortiz, waited. 
</P>
<P>
 It is that idle time, residents charge, that has led to many of the problems 
in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 They say the day laborers pass the day gambling, drinking, wandering the 
neighborhood and defecating and urinating in the bushes and at a church across 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a problem with them working, but it's the manner that they are 
going about it," said resident Keith Linden, complaining that the workers cause 
traffic jams and aggressively solicit customers at HomeBase. 
</P>
<P>
 While they acknowledge that urination and littering have occurred, the workers 
say they now use several trash cans provided by HomeBase and use the restroom 
at a nearby McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 HomeBase manager Frank Gomez said he does not have many problems with the 
workers, and Capt. Jack Scully, commander of the sheriff's station that 
services the area, said the laborers have caused few reported problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The day laborers and their supporters charge that racism is behind some of the 
complaints. Many opponents are African Americans, who are showing the same 
intolerance exhibited by white residents when blacks first moved to Ladera 
Heights in the 1970s, said Nancy Cervantes, an attorney with the Coalition for 
Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents deny race is a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ladera Heights, Cervantes and others maintain, the proposed ordinance is an 
extreme response to a situation that could have been solved without government 
intervention. They suggest establishing hiring sites similar to those in Harbor 
Gateway and North Hollywood as a way to curb parking lot congregating.

W. HOLLYWOOD MAY ORDER RATE CUT FOR CABLE TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 West Hollywood cable television subscribers may soon get that long-awaited 
price cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Wielding powers granted by the new federal cable regulation law, the City 
Council on Monday is expected to order Century Cable to trim nearly $4 off the 
price of its basic service package, now $24.08 a month. The council also may 
order refunds to the city's 11,000 subscribers retroactive to when regulation 
began in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The action would be the city's first foray into regulating cable television 
rates, which skyrocketed after deregulation in 1986. The 1992 cable law gave 
municipalities the right to regulate the cost of the most basic level of cable 
television -- local broadcast channels plus government and public-access 
channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills is also moving to roll back Century Cable rates before a March 
17 deadline stipulated by the federal cable act. Santa Monica and Los Angeles 
officials are studying the rates in their cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable customers have expected lower cable bills since the law was passed over 
the veto of former President George Bush. But instead, many West Hollywood 
residents were outraged last year when Century Cable repackaged its channels in 
such a way that customers ended up paying about $8 more to watch the same 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, who have jousted with the cable firm in the past, helped 
direct a flood of complaints to the Federal Communications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've probably received 600 letters and calls from people complaining," said 
Helen Goss, who oversees the city's cable television operations. "People in 
this community have passionate feelings about Century Cable." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the city's homes are wired for cable, which is about the only 
way to ensure a good television picture because nearby hills block over-the-air 
signals. Century also provides cable service in Beverly Hills, Santa Monica and 
West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Goss said the city expects upcoming federal rules to spell additional cuts and 
tighter control over the cost of "a la carte" packages, which include channels 
such as CNN and MTV that used to be part of basic service. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed $3.72 West Hollywood rollback is based on a complicated federal 
formula using figures provided by the cable company. The city hired a cable 
specialist to analyze the financial data. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not known whether Century will fight the rollback. Company officials had 
sought to delay Monday's hearing because some executives planned to be out of 
the country, Goss said. But the city has to enact any reductions by March 18. 
Century officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills is considering a rollback of $1.68 and has filed a complaint 
with the FCC protesting the creation of the "a la carte" packages as an attempt 
to evade local regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Before September, Century offered a 52-channel basic service -- including CNN 
and other satellite channels -- for $26.15. After repackaging, a customer had 
to pay $34.39 to keep those channels and get nine new ones offered in a new 
expanded package. A new bare-bones basic tier -- containing mainly broadcast, 
government and public-access channels -- was priced at $24.08.

BRIEFLY; ARTS: TEMPLE TO DEDICATE STAINED-GLASS WINDOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Sephardic Temple Tifereth Israel in Los Angeles has installed 
stained-glass "Sephardic Heritage Windows" designed by Israeli artist Raphael 
Abecassis. 
</P>
<P>
 The windows, commissioned by the Maurice Amado Foundation, will be dedicated 
at 11 a.m. March 13. They will serve as a living memorial to longtime temple 
members Dr. Morris and Regina Tarica. 
</P>
<P>
 Abecassis used Jewish symbols, Sephardic motifs and modern composition to 
complete the 22-foot-high windows, which include 6,000 separate pieces of 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
 The windows depict the history of Sephardic Jews, beginning with their 
expulsion from Spain in the 15th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 The temple, at 10500 Wilshire Blvd., is open to the public.

POLITICS; 8 WILL VIE FOR COUNCIL SEATS IN BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. JEANETTE AVENT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Beverly Hills Mayor Maxwell Salter declining to seek another term, it is 
virtually certain that the City Council will have at least one new face after 
the April election. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-person race for two seats includes only one incumbent, Robert K. 
Tanenbaum, who is seeking a third four-year term.  
</P>
<P>
 Salter declined to seek a third term, citing his belief that council members 
should be limited to two terms. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the candidates will meet for what is considered the most 
influential in a series of forums before the April 12 election. The League of 
Women Voters of Beverly Hills will host the candidates Thursday at 7 p.m. at 
Beverly Hills High School. The Southwest Beverly Hills Homeowners Assn. will 
host a forum next week. Both will be broadcast on Century Cable's Channel 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanenbaum, first elected in 1986, is noted both for his courtroom-style 
oratory and his frequent sparring with council members. During his eight years 
in office, he has also been instrumental in developing public-safety programs, 
and frequently champions the interests of residential neighborhoods. A resident 
for 15 years, he was the lone council member to vote against the Industrial 
Area Plan, the city's guide for new business development near the civic center, 
which he asserted would increase traffic on residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
 MeraLee Goldman, a former planning commissioner, and Les Bronte, a former 
Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce president, are widely seen as the strongest 
challengers in the race because of their high name recognition. This is the 
first council campaign for both. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman, a resident for 24 years, served two terms on the city's powerful 
Planning Commission. Bronte, a resident for 35 years, points to his 
participation in many sectors of the community, including the city's Traffic 
and Parking Commission and Caring for the Homeless Task Force as well as the 
Maple Center board and the 1993 School Bonds Steering Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Councilman Bernard J. (Bernie) Hecht, who developed a CPR training 
program for the city, is seeking to return to office after his narrow defeat to 
Councilman Thomas S. Levyn in 1992. Hecht, the retired owner of a trucking and 
warehouse business, has lived in Beverly Hills for 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates Mary Levin Cutler, Dr. Trisha Roth and Herm Shultz also have made 
previous but unsuccessful runs for the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler, a 37-year resident, is vice president of the Beverly Hills Municipal 
League civic group. She frequently speaks to the council about overdevelopment 
and the increasing number of oversize mansions on city hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth, an 11-year resident, also has addressed the council on a regular basis 
about her public health agenda, which includes smoke-free workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Shultz, a resident for 25 years, is president of Concern for Tenants Rights of 
Beverly Hills, an advocacy group for the city's apartment dwellers. The retired 
furniture store owner has served on the city's Affordable Housing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Robert Block, a 12-year resident, is a newcomer to City Hall affairs. The 
attorney has not served on city commissions, but points to his involvement in 
Beverly Hills schools among his qualifications for council. 
</P>
<P>
 Block, an attorney, drew attention in 1992 when he tried to intervene on 
behalf of two community groups in a court case that had been decided against 
the city. A developer had won a Superior Court decision allowing him to lease 
his Wilshire Boulevard building for medical offices. Block, who was 
representing Horace Mann Elementary School PTA and the 90211 Homeowner's Assn. 
on a volunteer basis, filed an unsuccessful appeal, arguing that the groups had 
not been notified of the suit despite their proximity to the building, and they 
had not had an opportunity to present their arguments about the traffic impact 
of a medical use. 
</P>
<P>
 No single issue is expected to galvanize voters. But candidates have spoken 
out against rising crime, traffic and the need to support the city's public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 At the forums, candidates are expected to hammer on the 15.4% increase in 
crime from 1992 to 1993. The city, which has 32,000 residents, recorded 2,825 
crimes last year -- 377 more than in 1992. Theft of valuables from vehicles 
registered the biggest jump among crime categories, with a rise from 574 to 849 
offenses reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The 130-member police force is the subject of an independent management audit 
authorized by the city last year to analyze the deployment of personnel and 
equipment. The department is one of several in the city undergoing a review to 
improve efficiency and save money. 
</P>
<P>
 Also high on the list of concerns for residents and candidates is the issue of 
preserving the quality of residential life. The impact of traffic and 
development on neighborhoods has been the focus of countless council meetings 
over the last two years, with residents demanding that the city combat commuter 
traffic through neighborhoods. The Candidates

COMMUNITY NEWS: BEVERLY HILLS; LONGTIME CITY CLERK USHIJIMA ANNOUNCES SHE WILL 
RETIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City Clerk Jean M. Ushijima has announced she will retire this spring after 
nearly 25 years of city service. 
</P>
<P>
 Ushijima, who joined the Beverly Hills staff as a legal secretary, was 
appointed city clerk by the City Council in 1973.She manages a staff of three 
in the city's clerk's office, which conducts elections, records City Council 
meetings and decisions and manages public records. 
</P>
<P>
 Ushijima told the council Tuesday that she plans to retire May 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The city clerk, along with the city manager and city attorney, is appointed by 
the council. No replacement has been chosen, Mayor Maxwell Salter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ushijima said she was proud to represent Beverly Hills at national meetings of 
city clerks. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she said she looks forward to traveling and spending more time with her 
husband, a retired aerospace engineer. "We already have tickets for June 1 to 
New Zealand," Ushijima said. 
</P>
<P>
 Salter said Ushijima's decision was a surprise, but she's been a "wonderfully 
efficient lady who has done an incredible job for the city."  
</P>
<P>
 Ushijima received the Superior Achievement in Community Services award from 
the city in 1991. In addition to her work for Beverly Hills, Ushijima served as 
the regional director of the International Institute of Municipal Clerks for 
four years, and one year as president of the City Clerks Assn. of California. 
The state association named her City Clerk of the Year in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Ushijima was reappointed to the League of California Cities Administrative 
Services Committee in 1992 after having served on the committee from 1982 to 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Ushijima graduated magna cum laude in 1981 from the University of San 
Francisco with a bachelor of science degree in human relations and 
organizational behavior. Originally from Chicago, she has resided in West Los 
Angeles for more than 30 years. G. JEANNETTE AVENT

COMMUNITY NEWS: WEST ADAMS; SHE'S SEEN TO IT THAT THE SHOW GOES ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lula Washington has choreographed some pretty fancy footwork in her career, 
but efforts to continue her business after it was devastated by the recent 
earthquake have required all the creative energy she can muster. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been pretty crazy," Washington said. "I've had to get through a lot of 
red tape. But at least now I know I can get funds to rebuild." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's L.A. Contemporary Dance Theatre, in an industrial-style building 
at 5179 W. Adams Blvd. near La Brea Avenue, was one of hundreds of businesses 
that sustained damage in the Jan. 17 quake. After a month of appealing to the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency for aid -- she was initially turned down -- 
Washington said she is now assured of grant money once FEMA officials assess 
the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington said disaster relief officials consider arts organizations 
"nonessential." Her battle to qualify for a FEMA grant drove her to enlist the 
help of Councilman Nate Holden, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), 
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) and others not involved in the arts, 
who vouched for the studio's importance to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lula's not only an arts institution in the community, she runs a viable 
business that people benefit from in a lot of ways," said Moore spokeswoman Joy 
Atkinson, who cited Washington's theater as crucial to an after-school arts 
program recently launched by Moore's office. "The types of programs she runs 
are absolutely essential to the growth of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The theater, owned by Washington and her husband, Irwin, occupies two floors 
of studio and performance space in the West Adams Boulevard building. The 
14-year-old nonprofit theater houses low-cost dance and tumbling classes for 
youth, as well as a professional troupe that tours nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 But everything came to a halt when the magnitude 6.8 temblor shifted the 
studio roof, knocked out a back supporting wall and damaged several other 
walls. City inspectors red-tagged the property and classes had to be suspended. 
Washington is awaiting results of a stress test that will determine if the 
studio can be salvaged or whether it must be razed. 
</P>
<P>
 With virtually no emergency or reserve funds, the Washingtons began hunting 
for a building that could donate rehearsal space. The search proved exhaustive 
but yielded three sites: the Colburn School of Performing Arts on Figueroa 
Street, the Los Angeles Theatre Centre in Downtown and the Crossroads School in 
Santa Monica. Touring company rehearsals and youth classes have resumed. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington said FEMA has agreed to cover 90% of rebuilding costs, which could 
exceed $200,000. She said she is prepared to roll up her sleeves to raise the 
balance of the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to stay right here in the community," she added. "People have told me: 
'This is the perfect chance to relocate in Culver City or Santa Monica.' But 
the greatest need is right here." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: CULVER CITY; SCHOOL BOARD PROCEEDS WITH PLAN TO RELOCATE 
IMMERSION PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Culver City school board has declined to reconsider its decision to move 
the district's Japanese and Spanish immersion program into a vacant elementary 
school, over the protests of about 20 parents of Japanese immersion pupils. 
</P>
<P>
 The district had voted last month to move the immersion programs, in which 300 
students are enrolled, to El Marino Elementary next fall, making it a foreign 
language magnet school.Concern about overcrowding at El Rincon, home to the 
Spanish immersion program, was also a reason for the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of students in the Japanese program, housed at Farragut Elementary, 
last week asked the board to reconsider the move, saying it will make driving 
their children to school more difficult. No busing is planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the parents were not taken into consideration," said Coco Kida, whose 
kindergartner is enrolled in Farragut's Japanese immersion program. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we put our kids in the program, we figured that if it wasn't successful, 
our kids could still remain at Farragut," said parent Dennis Tracy. Tracy said 
he will take his children out of the immersion program to keep them at the 
school.

SCENE STEALERS; LOOKING FOR PANORAMIC CROP SHOT? A SEASCAPE, FLOATING GOLF 
GREEN OR MILITARY OUTPOST? AND HOW ABOUT CHEAP LABOR? IT SEEMS AS THOUGH 
EVERYONE OUTSIDE HOLLYWOOD HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER THE FILM AND TELEVISION 
INDUSTRY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wearing come-hither smiles and rose-colored sunglasses, representatives from 
Thailand to Pittsburgh descended on Santa Monica last week, hoping to snatch a 
piece of L.A.'s signature film and television industry. 
</P>
<P>
 They had their work cut out for them. Anyone venturing outside the annual 
location expo quickly encountered the sparkling Pacific Ocean, temperatures 
approaching 80 degrees and maybe even a celebrity or two. Southern California, 
for all its recent misfortunes, still looked every bit the glamour capital of 
the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful -- I rented a convertible," a partially thawed convention 
official from New York marveled. But none of that was enough to keep boosters 
of frozen flatlands, crime-plagued cities and developing countries from making 
a grab for Tinseltown's tarnished crown. 
</P>
<P>
 Packed into the Santa Monica Convention Center, nearly 200 exhibitors spent 
three days at Location Expo '94, which ended Monday, pitching their locales as 
ideal for movie and TV production. 
</P>
<P>
 They insisted they came not to steal jobs from the Los Angeles area, as some 
local officials claimed, but to attract so-called "location" work that would be 
done outside of Southern California anyway. Whatever their motives, the 
delegates hawked their respective homes with a fervor that, despite the slick 
brochures and sweet financial inducements, sometimes seemed strained. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the sales job confronting North Dakota, which hopes to capitalize on 
its status as the nation's leading sunflower and rapeseed producer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are just huge fields of the stuff," enthused Kip Stolberg of the North 
Dakota Film Office, pointing to the potential for "panoramic crop shots" near 
Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
 He also zealously promoted a defunct missile bunker as an ideal sci-fi movie 
set. But as the convention wound down, it became clear that North Dakota had a 
visibility problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "People walk by here and say, 'Oh, North Dakota,' " Stolberg grumbled. "It's 
like an afterthought. Some of these areas are just screaming to be used." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, representatives from almost every corner of the planet showed up in 
Santa Monica screaming to be used, which helps explain why the exposition -- 
sponsored by the Assn. of Film Commissioners International -- is the largest 
event of its kind anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The show attracted 6,000 people, many of them producer-types based on the 
Westside. It was one of the major events associated with the American Film 
Market, a nine-day spree of movie marketing that attracts 10,000 visitors 
annually, injecting millions of dollars into the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 For Santa Monica, still recovering from the Jan. 17 earthquake, the timing 
couldn't have been better. 
</P>
<P>
 "February was a rough month," said Kathleen Rawson of the city's Convention 
and Visitors Bureau. "With the AFM coming into town, it filled our hotels 
again, and they needed it. For them it was the light at the end of the tunnel." 
</P>
<P>
 For television and movie producers, meanwhile, the convention provides a way 
to scour the world for film locales without leaving the confines of the 
Convention Center. For localities, it's a chance to compete for a slice of a 
$4-billion industry that tends to be clean, prestigious and increasingly 
lucrative. 
</P>
<P>
 In Utah alone, for example, the industry now pumps $88 million a year into the 
state, up from $38 million just two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles officials estimate that such location shooting represents a $1 
billion drain on the local economy, but that is of little concern to far-flung 
convention delegates who have their own interests to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got some real interesting locations, like some massive hydroelectric 
plants on the Mississippi River," said Wendol Jarvis, of the Iowa Film Office. 
"There's a turbine room that just goes on forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Not about to be outdone by a bunch of turbines, Idaho officials boasted of 
numerous state treasures, including the "tallest sand dunes in the United 
States" and the world's only floating golf green. 
</P>
<P>
 A brochure on Missouri described the Show Me State as "Your 69,674-Square-Mile 
Back Lot," while Louisiana officials peppered their PR with complimentary grab 
bags of Cajun spices and other indigenous goodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're one of the few states that has really good swamps," boasted David 
Jones, director of the Louisiana Film Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While hyping local points of interest, many conventioneers used strangely 
similar phrasing. Whether it was Arkansas or Israel, places were invariably 
depicted as offering breathtaking mountains, dramatic deserts and modern cities 
-- all within a short drive. And what about L.A.? 
</P>
<P>
 Still reeling from its much-publicized string of calamities, and from a 
lingering perception that it isn't business-friendly, the city was fair game. 
It was denied exhibit space after failing to register for the expo in time, 
forcing angry and chagrined city officials to pitch a promotional tent on the 
grounds of the adjacent county courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 An "L.A. Stands Alone" banner identified the rogue exhibit, but it may as well 
have read, "L.A. Stands Humiliated." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the Convention Center, rival delegations smelled blood. "After 
California's disasters (fires, earthquakes, mudslides, etc.), we're getting a 
lot of calls," said Karen Runtel of the Oregon Film Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared with Los Angeles, Miami is "more receptive" and "more eager to 
please" filmmakers, said Dade County delegate Robert Reboso. What's more, he 
added, it has better weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgette Deemer lauded the unparalleled beauty of the Hawaiian Islands. "And 
no earthquakes," she added. "At least nothing like you have here." 
</P>
<P>
 As though it were a mandatory convention oath, participants almost universally 
touted cheap labor costs and streamlined governmental procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 A Thai representative contended that a $3-million movie made in Thailand could 
cost $6 million if it were filmed in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some locales made clear they would do almost anything to make producers happy. 
A pair of economic development officials from Saskatchewan, Canada, noted that 
the provincial government there arranged delivery of 10,000 grasshoppers from 
Alberta to facilitate a film about a town threatened by locusts. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials even allowed the importation of jumbo African grasshoppers needed 
for close-up shots -- a move that put local agriculture at potential risk by 
introducing a new insect into the area. "If they had escaped, there would have 
been serious problems," a Saskatchewan envoy acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, none of the exhibiting locales seemed to have any serious 
problems of any kind -- at least none they were willing to admit to. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to name one negative aspect of Jamaica, Jacqueline Neath of that 
country's Film Office drew a blank. "I can't think of anything," she said. 
Reminded of Jamaica's grinding poverty, she replied, "It's not like Haiti or 
the Dominican Republic." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Hong Kong booth, conventioneer Lisa Sjolund hardly blinked when asked 
if the British colony's transfer to communist China in 1997 might pose a 
problem for production companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not at all," she said. "We can't tell the future, but we feel very confident 
about our relationship with China." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, the Louisiana official, dismissed a recent story in a national news 
magazine that enumerated New Orleans' woes -- including a large increase in the 
homicide rate -- under the headline, "The Big Queasy." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like any other major urban center," Jones said. "Very few people 
are getting killed in the mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, all's well in Thailand too. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a coup, then the military was going to take over but the king stepped 
in," a Thai representative patiently explained. "Now democracy is slowly 
working, (but) it takes time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the talk was not of politics, but of the little things that give 
places character and make them amenable to movie-making. 
</P>
<P>
 A South Dakota rep spoke fondly of a huge biker rally in the town of Sturgis, 
and added "We have the biggest Buffalo herds." Nova Scotia representative Helen 
Wickwire-Foster spoke of wind-swept seascapes, centuries-old military outposts 
and the local dish haggis, a pudding made of minced sheep organs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, she said, "There are always bagpipes playing in Nova Scotia." 
</P>
<P>
 Unglamorous Pittsburgh also got into the act. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh Film Office spokesman Robert Curran, seated behind a small mound of 
complimentary Clark Bars, conceded that the town "has been the punch line of a 
lot of jokes" and lacks certain scenic elements. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to shoot the desert or a beach scene in Pittsburgh, you have a 
problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Curran stressed that the smoky Steel City of yesteryear has given way to a 
shiny, architecturally varied metropolis anxious to cater to filmmakers. What's 
more, Pittsburgh has retained an identify -- and a cuisine -- all its own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clark Bars and Iron City Beer," he said with a shrug. "What more could you 
ask for?" On the Cover: Promotional pins attached to the badge of one 
conventioneer underscore the variety of locales that came to Location Expo '94 
seeking film and television business. The three-day expo at the Santa Monica 
Convention Center ended Monday.

came to her craft a bit later than most, and more through pain than ambition. 
</P>
<P>
 She lives in a corner house on a typical Culver City street -- flat and 
tree-lined, with neat front lawns. Ross' house looks typical, too, until you 
step inside. That's when you begin to suspect there's something magical inside. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the pictures of children and grandchildren on the baby grand piano, 
or the needlepoint pillows she sewed. Nor is it her collections of teaspoons 
and colorful glass and marble eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 The real magic is Ross, 68. She exudes what mythologist and teacher Joseph 
Campbell said was the true experience of life: the rapture of being alive. To 
feel this way, she had to liberate herself. And the retired teacher 
accomplished that by reclaiming and re-creating her life -- by undergoing 
Jungian analysis and writing books for children about Jewish folk stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross had an unlikely upbringing for a writer of Jewish tales. Her parents 
worked from dawn until midnight, leaving her in the care of strangers who 
exposed her to Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first religion was Catholicism. I knew I was Jewish by birth, but because 
my parents weren't there, a 9 o'clock occurrence -- Mass -- brought me to 
Catholicism. I was so young when I sat in a pew that my feet looked at me. The 
nuns were comforting, but what troubled me were the tears coming from the eyes 
of a statue of Jesus. I always felt so sad that he was crying," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until she was in her 50s that she started to understand the effect 
of that abandonment. She was married with three children, teaching 
kindergarten. After a family crisis (she declines to describe it for 
publication), she began undergoing Jungian analysis, which relies heavily on 
dream interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 "My analyst suggested I write my dreams and then the dialogue and interaction 
between the characters in my dreams," she said. "He then suggested that I take 
children's story-writing classes at UCLA Extension. Painful childhoods never go 
away. Between the classes, a writing group and my teacher, Terry Dunnahoo, I 
flourished." 
</P>
<P>
 It was her teacher's approval that gave her the motivation to rewrite her 
first manuscript so many times that there was nothing left to do but send it to 
publishers. The rejection letters were positive until the last sentence, which 
said they were sorry but . . . until Harper Row accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 The title of the book was, "The Little Old Man and His Dreams," a story about 
the strength of her mother, who lived with Ross at the end of her life and 
provided much of the creative material that her daughter has used in her 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother died the year "The Little Old Man and His Dreams" was published, 
but not before giving Ross the idea for her second book. 
</P>
<P>
 One day she saw her mother kiss a letter from her grandson and say, "I'm just 
like Buba (grandmother) Leah." When Ross asked her to explain what she meant, 
her mother said that in Europe, her grandmother used to kiss letters from her 
children in America. The grandmother called the letters her "paper children." 
</P>
<P>
 The conversation inspired Ross to write "Buba Leah and Her Paper Children." 
The book was published in 1991, the same year her husband died of cancer. Three 
years later, her next book is ready for publication. Called "Sarah, Also Known 
As Hannah," it is based on her mother's journey from Europe to America at age 
12. 
</P>
<P>
 In writing all three works, Ross says, the key was to dig deep. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must look within to write a book. If you can't get past the surface you 
never become an author -- you remain a writer. It's the same with life. I'm 
living, I'm not surviving. I don't want to be just a survivor," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Ross calls herself a born-again Jew. Because she had no religious 
background in Judaism she studies Hebrew so that she can read the prayers when 
she attends synagogue. She's also listening to French language tapes because 
she plans to live in France and write a book about a family that fled the 
Nazis, staying 100 miles ahead of them. She's researching folk tales of 
different lands and wants to publish them according to country of origin. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a year, she visits schools in Long Beach to speak to students on Author 
Day. The name of her lecture is "Birth of a Book."  
</P>
<P>
 "The teacher can read my books so I come in and show children how a book gets 
born. I bring my transcript, my contract, black and white sketches and I draw a 
circle on the board with spokes coming out and say this is how you write a 
story: I pick a subject and each child says one descriptive word and we fill 
each spoke. From that we write three sentences and that's the beginning," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lillian Hammer Ross believes in bashert -- the Yiddish word for "meant to be." 
She feels her life has meaning and what is unknown to her comes through her 
dreams, which she still interprets with her analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross wouldn't be caught without a dream.

REGIONAL REPORT; BOYLE HEIGHTS; REAL ESTATE FIRM SPONSORS SCHOOL TOY LIBRARY 
</P>

<P>
 Starting Tuesday, elementary children at Utah Street School in Boyle Heights 
will be able to borrow everything from Barbie dolls to soccer balls to the 
newly popular Mighty Morphin Power Rangers at the school's new toy library. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitsui Fudosan (U.S.A.), a Japanese real estate development firm with offices 
in Downtown Los Angeles, is sponsoring the project and has converted a 
classroom into a library with custom shelves, new carpeting and 500 to 600 
toys. Utah Street School is the first campus in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District to have a privately sponsored toy library. 
</P>
<P>
 Although students on Friday had an opportunity to tour the freshly painted 
library after an opening ceremony, it will be open for browsing and borrowing 
only on Tuesdays and Wednesdays during its first three months, after which the 
company will decide whether it will remain a twice-weekly operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children's eyes are going to fall out when they see this," Principal Dee 
Dee Mynatt said as she showed off the well-stocked library before the tour last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The library will lend videos, puzzles, sports equipment, dolls and board 
games. Students will be allowed to check out one toy per week. Those who return 
toys on time and in good condition will earn points. 
</P>
<P>
 After earning a predetermined number of points, students will be allowed to 
select a toy to keep from the Awards Cabinet. The toys will get progressively 
bigger and better as the children continue to earn and redeem points. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all of the 900 students attending Utah Street School are residents of 
the Aliso Village Housing Project, one of the largest public housing projects 
in Los Angeles. The school's population is roughly 95% Latino, 3% African 
American and 2% Asian. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a good idea, because a lot of kids live in the projects and 
don't have toys to play with," said Rosalia Meraz, a sixth-grader who lives in 
Aliso Village. "I think it'll be good especially for the little ones who don't 
have anything to do after school." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitsui chairman Shuhei Okuda said he hopes to expand the program throughout 
the Los Angeles school district. DIANE SEO

REGIONAL REPORT; SAN PEDRO; LETTER BLITZ HALTS PROPOSED TAX ON BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a furious letter-writing campaign, more than 200 merchants and property 
owners in downtown San Pedro have blocked a plan to tax their businesses for 
public improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed yearly assessments of $100 to $300 had the strong backing of Los 
Angeles City Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., whose district includes San 
Pedro.Some property owners within the community's central business district 
also supported it. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents, calling the assessments excessive and unjustified, mounted a 
protest that led to letters from 236 of the 419 businesses in the area, 
generally bounded by Harbor Boulevard, Pacific Avenue and 3rd and 10th streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter-writing effort forced the city, under state law, to drop the 
assessment plan for at least a year because it was opposed by more than 50% of 
those it would affect. Svorinich plans to reintroduce the plan next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal to establish the business improvement district was initially 
pushed by Svorinich's predecessor, Joan Milke Flores. She had responded to 
requests by some San Pedro businesses that the area be improved with better 
street lighting and other public works projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan Svorinich embraced after defeating Flores last year, the work 
was to be financed by an annual fee that would be assessed based on the type of 
business in the area. But almost from its inception, the plan ran afoul of many 
business owners who not only considered the assessments excessive but their 
purpose vague. GREG KRIKORIAN

NO MORE BUSINESS AS USUAL FOR KOREAN, LATINO MERCHANTS; RELATIONS: IN DOWNTOWN 
SANTA ANA, TENSIONS BETWEEN THE TWO ETHNICITIES HAVE EASED IN THE COMMERCIAL 
REALM AS COMMUNITY LEADERS AND TRADE GROUPS WORK TO GET KOREANS MORE INVOLVED 
IN CIVIC AFFAIRS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shining from the wall of John S. Kim's cluttered Santa Ana office are 
snapshots of more than two dozen grinning Latino boys and girls: grateful Pio 
Pico Elementary School students whose uniforms were purchased by Kim and a 
group of other Korean businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles away from Kim's auto parts store, a group of downtown Korean 
merchants who deal in everything from sneakers to electronics recently inspired 
similar gratitude when they pooled their money and donated two bicycles to a 
graffiti-removal drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The gifts are just one sign that the growing Korean business community is 
eager to participate in the heavily Latino city's civic affairs, both for the 
good of the community and the simple sake of good business.  
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Korean business leaders have been stepping up efforts to pull 
the city's increasing number of their fellow merchants into the mainstream 
fold, and the city's business associations are campaigning heavily alongside 
them.  
</P>
<P>
 Overtures include the first-ever Korean-language newsletter published two 
weeks ago by the Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce's Korean Business Committee, and 
heavy lobbying by Downtown Santa Ana Business Assn. Vice President Teresa 
Saldivar to recruit Korean members for at least two of the three board seats 
opening Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 As the number of Korean businesses in Santa Ana has grown to an estimated 600, 
business leaders say these nascent gestures are key to preventing the simmering 
hostilities between Latino and Korean merchants that flared during the 1992 Los 
Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 While tension did not turn to violence in Santa Ana, Latino merchants' 
complaints that their Korean counterparts were aloof or not participating in 
community projects sparked a resentment that is only now healing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are from a country where business is strictly business," said Dr. Joong 
Park, a Santa Ana physician and the chairman of the chamber's Korean committee. 
"Here we are learning about business as a connection with the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We owe something to this community, whether it's cultural or educational. But 
in our country, most community problems are handled by government. It will take 
some time to learn these new concepts."  
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, some are already learning, and they are finding their community 
involvement rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber's Korean committee -- made up of about 30 members -- donated the 
school uniforms to a first- and third-grade class at Pio Pico Elementary School 
last Christmas, and this year plans to sponsor Korean Tae Kwon Do classes for 
troubled youths as an alternative to gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 The new newsletter -- called the Korean Business Update and spearheaded by 
Park and Kim -- has already spurred five people to join the chamber, Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim compiled a list of 230 Santa Ana Korean businesses, and the chamber mailed 
each a copy of the Korean Business Update.  
</P>
<P>
 Being plugged in to an association with political clout can help resolve 
day-to-day problems of security, business licenses or trash hauling, Park said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were not aware that we can accomplish more through the chamber, because 
the chamber is an established power," Park said of non-members. "They tried to 
just handle it on their own." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Korean business committee contacts police, fire officials and other 
government officials when a member has a problem. The group has also brought in 
speakers from the Employment Development Department and the Internal Revenue 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 But Park said he tries to emphasize the more intangible benefits when making 
his sales pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we comfort or support someone who is less fortunate than we are, we can 
benefit from that," Park said. "We as Koreans, we lack that in some ways. . . . 
If people who want to join are looking purely for monetary or security 
benefits, I don't think they will find it. The reason why we have to join is 
more on moral grounds . . . because of city pride." 
</P>
<P>
 Kwang Yon Cho, who owns Top Video and the strip mall it occupies on West 1st 
Street, is one of the new members. After receiving the Korean Business Update, 
he attended a Feb. 24 seminar on dealing with the recession, and was sold on 
the notion of working more closely with other merchants.  
</P>
<P>
 Cho, who ran a Compton gas station for a decade before opening his Santa Ana 
business four years ago, said he has never had problems with security or 
business licenses that the chamber could have helped him with. He is joining 
because it makes good sense to be connected to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better for business," Cho said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saldivar, vice president of the Downtown Santa Ana Business Assn., concurs. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years, she has knocked on doors downtown to encourage Korean 
merchants to get involved with the association's Mother's Day events and gift 
certificate drives. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, her frustration peaked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had very poor support from Korean merchants, and I was very vocal about 
it," said Saldivar, a jeweler who has served on the board for a decade.  
</P>
<P>
 "I would ask them to purchase a $10 gift certificate, and they would say, 'I 
don't understand you.' I felt they were taking the customers' money, but they 
weren't willing to spend $10 on a gift certificate. . . . The tension at that 
point was very high, not just with me but with other Hispanic merchants." 
</P>
<P>
 She voiced her concerns in the Korean press last year, opening a welcome 
dialogue with Korean business leaders. They told her about the language 
constraints many merchants face. And so, for the first time, Saldivar 
distributed her group's merchants' poll in Korean, as well as Spanish and 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 The business climate has improved markedly and tensions are down, she said. 
Whereas two years ago many of her customers complained of curt treatment at 
nearby Korean-owned stores, now their comments are more positive, Saldivar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jhon Cho, owner of the La Bonita Boutique, said he is eager to work with her 
group and last year gave away a dress for the Mother's Day raffle.  
</P>
<P>
 But Cho, like many of the downtown's Korean merchants, said his business is 
family-run and he has little time for committee meetings. He lives in Fullerton 
and has owned his boutique for 3 1/2 years. He said he and his wife have their 
hands full with their two children, ages 7 and 10, and their small store, 
stocked with pastel dresses and open seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 He is resisting Saldivar's efforts to lure him into the downtown association 
as a board member. "Teresa comes in and says, 'Come to the meeting!' But I'm 
here by myself. I don't have time to go," Cho said. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street, the city's Fiesta Marketplace, a collective of merchants, has 
seen a sharp increase in the number of Korean business people. At Fiesta 
Bargain, a swap-meet-style space, 13 of the 19 merchants are Korean, manager 
Jose Romo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchant Teresa Sun Woo has worked hard to involve more of the merchants in 
downtown business affairs, and while many still do not attend meetings, they 
share their concerns with Romo, who attends the meeting as an emissary. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of Korean business people here in Santa Ana, and we're 
targeting the same customers," Romo said. "I think it's better if we do it as a 
group rather than everybody doing it on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past year, the Korean business people here want to know what is going 
on. Before, they would just close the door," Romo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the merchants pitched in their money for the two bicycles. But some 
still shy away from full participation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take a little longer, but not too long. We'll see a change this 
year," Romo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Park agreed. "We have to stimulate the people," he said. "Now we are 
beginning."

DANA PARSONS: A COLUMN OF THANKS TO THOSE WHO READ -- AND WRITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm a little reflective this week because Friday's column was the 500th since 
I began this chore of thrice-weekly meditations. There's nothing special about 
that number, other than it's about 494 more than I thought I could crank out 
when they gave me the job. 
</P>
<P>
 So today, before embarking on the next 500 (ugh) and at the risk of coming 
across like a slobbery Catskills comic, I want to send out a thank-you note to 
you readers. 
</P>
<P>
 A strange bond develops between a columnist and readers. I talk to you through 
the column, and you talk back through your letters. In a bizarre way, we sort 
of know each other. Sometimes we like each other, sometimes we don't. Some of 
you think I'm inside your head; some of you think I'm out of mine. 
</P>
<P>
 A Huntington Beach man recently wrote: "Always a delight to read your 
articles. You seem such a reasonable, witty and sensible man." 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't square with a man in Dana Point who some time ago offered a 
four-page handwritten letter with this painful assessment: "The content of your 
articles is rarely relevant to anything of any interest to anyone." He added, 
however, that I would always be welcome in his home. 
</P>
<P>
 I should give him the address of the man from Huntington Park in Los Angeles 
County, who said he stumbled upon a column by chance: "I want to thank you for 
your exceptional insights about life's trials and tribulations. I now don't 
feel so alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of insights: "From reading your columns," writes a woman from 
Fullerton, "I sense you struggle with the Christian roots in your upbringing. 
You know right from wrong. You are running from the truths that were taught to 
you from the Bible as a child. And try as you may to rationalize them away, 
they still haunt you." 
</P>
<P>
 That came last week and was one of many from people who felt angry or betrayed 
when I was cavalier about the existence of topless nightclubs. A woman named 
Tricia wrote: "While I don't align myself with all of your viewpoints, I have 
tended to be a supporter of yours, even when those around me have disagreed and 
stopped reading your column. I guess they were right." 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Tricia: No, they aren't right. Trust your own instincts. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman from Orange decided not to mince words: "When you have the pleasure, 
honor and intestinal fortitude to enter into a real relationship with a real 
girlfriend/wife and you begin to explore real intimacy and connectedness with a 
real woman, you may reconsider your fledgling, somewhat callous position on 
adult entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, after a column a few weeks ago on "re-inventing" myself, a Huntington 
Beach woman wrote: "Here's one woman who hopes you never change." 
</P>
<P>
 Recent columns critical of public officials inspired some of you to laud my 
"courage," a personality trait apparently lost on the man from Garden Grove, 
who ripped me for being too squishy on gun ownership. He offered the postscript 
that, "I doubt you have the sack to respond to this." 
</P>
<P>
 He was correct. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent tongue-in-cheek column about Richard Nixon confessing all about 
Watergate prompted a Newport Beach reader to write to me on school notebook 
paper. Lest there be any doubt why, the writer explained: "I didn't want to 
waste nice stationery on the likes of you." 
</P>
<P>
 That sort of diluted the effect of a nice note from a Fullerton woman that 
greeted me when I recently returned from vacation: "This is prompted more now 
by a sense of separation anxiety with your column not appearing because of 
vacation. I didn't realize how much I had grown to enjoy tri-weekly doses of 
your yuppie humor and predicaments." 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, I hope this mixed bag of letters helps explain why I'm so 
disturbed. If you got diagnoses this contradictory, don't you think you'd be a 
little nuts too? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't worry, I'll muddle through. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you like the column or think I'm a dope, thanks for taking time to 
write or call. Your comments supply the energy for the column and, believe me, 
every letter is read and taken to heart (some of them, too much). 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure I'm up for another 500, and I know many of you aren't, either. 
</P>
<P>
 But what the heck, let's give it a shot. 
</P>

DEMOCRATS HEAR BROWN, GARAMENDI; CONVENTION: TREASURER WINS STRAW POLL AT 
GATHERING OF COUNTY PARTY MEMBERS DESIGNED TO WHIP UP ANTI-REPUBLICAN FERVOR. 
REP. DORNAN IS A CHOICE TARGET.

 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown and state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi 
brought their gubernatorial campaigns on Saturday to a convention of Orange 
County Democrats, virtually ignoring each other and instead aiming their fire 
at Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 In a straw poll taken throughout the day, Brown beat Garamendi by a margin of 
140 votes to 114. The third Democrat in the race, state Sen. Tom Hayden of 
Santa Monica, did not attend the meeting, but received 27 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The convention of about 500 Orange County Democrats served as a pep rally for 
the political party that is seeking to build momentum in a county controlled by 
the Republican Party, which holds an 18-point voter registration margin over 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading off a forum for statewide candidates, Brown said that until Wilson 
faced the pressure of an election year, the governor did not fight the 
migration of California jobs to other states, that he cut education funding 
without trying to improve schools, and that he "talks tough on crime at the 
front door while he lets dangerous parolees out the back door."

 Californians, she said, do not feel safer and do not feel more economic 
security than they did before Wilson took office. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's why we need a change from the Rip Van Wilson who's been sleeping 
and slumbering for the last three years in the governor's office," Brown told 
the delegates. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, who has attracted attention in local communities throughout the 
state by "working" side-by-side with everyday workers such as jailers, teachers 
and factory workers, said Wilson "does not have a clue, does not have the 
foggiest understanding of what's taking place" on issues such as worker safety 
and California's choked transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi grew more passionate as he spoke about health care. His own plan for 
California, which has never been approved, served as the basis for President 
Clinton's health-care plan that has run into a firestorm of criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I hear after 25 years of my crusade to establish a national health plan, 
when I hear the Republicans say to me that there's no health crisis, oh boy, 
I'm telling you, we are in for a fight," Garamendi said. "We will have a 
national health plan that provides health care to every single American, and it 
will be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, state Democratic Party Chairman Bill Press urged Orange 
County Democrats to help "get rid of that cruel and that cold and that callous, 
incompetent and poor excuse for a governor named Pete Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic candidates for state attorney general also spoke to the 
convention and were included in the straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) received 201 votes and San Francisco 
Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith, who narrowly lost the 1992 general election to 
Republican Dan Lungren, garnered 75 votes from the local Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Convention organizers said the meeting should serve as a reminder to 
Democratic statewide candidates that Orange County should not be ignored -- 
that Democrats here can cut into the huge margins that statewide Republican 
candidates often rely on to carry them over the top. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to diminish (Republican) influence," former Orange County 
Democratic Chairman Howard Adler said. "Orange County is their base. They have 
to win big here. To the point that we can diminish that, it helps Democrats win 
statewide." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Having increased their party's vote totals against Republicans during the 1992 
election, Orange County Democrats have set their sights on defeating 
conservative Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
 Local party leaders are also going after two other central Orange County 
legislative seats where Democrats have high registration numbers: the 34th 
Senate District where Republican state Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove) is 
seeking re-election, and the 68th District Assembly seat now held by Curt 
Pringle (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
 The task will not be easy for the Democrats, who risk losing the only local 
legislative seat they now hold: in Umberg's 69th Assembly District. The 
Republicans have vowed to go after that seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan, a 16-year incumbent, recently announced he would seek one final term 
to the 46th Congressional District, and Democrats believe that may be their 
best shot for a new legislative seat. Democrats outnumber Republicans in that 
district with 47% of the registered voters, compared to 42% for Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 But part of the Democrats' problem in that district may be their own June 7 
primary, which features a wide-open field of largely unknown candidates, many 
political novices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic field widened Saturday when Madelene E. Arakelian, the owner of 
a trash hauling firm, announced she would be a candidate in the 46th 
Congressional District instead of running for the Board of Supervisors as she 
had originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Democratic candidates seeking Dornan's seat include the 1992 Democratic 
nominee Robert J. Banuelos of Santa Ana; Michael P. Farber of Santa Ana, who 
was an unsuccessful Democratic nominee in 1992 for another congressional 
district; J.M. Ivler of Los Alamitos; Huu Chung Nguyen of Orange, and Don Payne 
of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 A "Beat Bob" rally during Saturday's convention featured a videotape of 
Dornan's more inflammatory quotes and a portion of a 1984 debate between Dornan 
and former Orange County Rep. Jerry Patterson, who lost the seat to Dornan that 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Offering advice to Democratic candidates seeking to unseat Dornan, Patterson 
said they would know when they were making Dornan uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "When his eyes start popping out and they start going back and forth, he's 
losing it," Patterson said. "He's only a bully and he's only dangerous if he 
thinks he will scare you." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Kasper, executive director of the "Beat Bob" campaign, also called Dornan 
one of the most "despicable" members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan has used the "Beat Bob" campaign to raise money for reelection. During 
a recent fund-raising letter sent to supporters, Dornan quoted the Democrats' 
literature and called it "filth" and "lies." 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to replace me with a liberal who will blindly support Clinton's 
socialist policies," Dornan wrote.

'POWER RANGERS' SEEN AS UNRULY MODELS TO YOUTHS; RESEARCH: CAL STATE FULLERTON 
STUDY CONCLUDES THAT CHILDREN EXPOSED TO TV HEROES ARE MORE AGGRESSIVE TOWARD 
COUNTERPARTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Allowing your children to watch "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" can be 
dangerous to other children's health. 
</P>
<P>
 That warning comes from Cal State Fullerton researchers, who observed as 
children exposed to a "Power Rangers" episode immediately responded by 
harassing playmates with karate kicks and aggressive shoves. 
</P>
<P>
 Children who weren't allowed to watch the single episode of the Fox mega-hit 
did nothing worse than take other youngsters' crayons in the hour after the 
show, the observers found in their two-day study last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the scary things about violence in the media is it gives children new 
ideas about how to be aggressive and be violent," said Chris Boyatzis , an 
assistant professor in Cal State Fullerton's child development department, who 
oversaw the study. The show "transmits specific forms of violent behavior that 
the kids may not know" before they watch." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think parents need to observe what their children are watching," said 
Kristen Nesbitt, a 23-year-old senior who said she will submit the results of 
what began as a simple class project for publication in a psychology journal. 
"A lot of times, kids take what they see on TV out to the real world." 
</P>
<P>
 What millions of children see each week on "Power Rangers" is five teen-agers 
"morphing" into spandex-clad super-heroes who use karate chops and magic swords 
to conquer monsters sent to Earth by "Rita Repulsa, the Empress of Evil." 
</P>
<P>
 The show's creators at Saban Entertainment deny that it makes youngsters 
violent, saying that each episode concludes with a positive message, and that 
children who watch the live-action show know the fight scenes are just fantasy. 
A publicist for the producer declined further comment, saying he had not yet 
seen the study. 
</P>
<P>
 But Boyatzis called that argument "dangerous and misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if the producers think it's clearly marked as fantasy, the kids are 
still going to copy it, fantasy or not," Boyatzis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyatzis acknowledged that his students' observations merely validate 
"hundreds" of earlier research studies showing that violence on television can 
lead to violent behavior in real life. But he said that the "contribution of 
our study is that we're looking at 'Power Rangers,' which is the hottest thing 
right now. Here is clear evidence that 'Power Rangers' is leading to more 
aggressive behavior in children." 
</P>
<P>
 Last October, Nesbitt and research partner Gina Matillo, another undergraduate 
studying child development, split 52 after-school day-care students at Brea's 
Mariposa Elementary School into two groups. 
</P>
<P>
 They showed one group of the 6- to 11-year-olds a 23-minute episode of "Power 
Rangers" that contained 140 aggressive acts, according to their count. Then the 
researchers watched the children play indoors, just as they do each afternoon 
as they await their parents. Parents gave permission for the children to 
participate in the research. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, the researchers watched the second group playing with the same 
toys in the same room, but without having first seen "Power Rangers." 
</P>
<P>
 The students watched each child in the two groups for two minutes apiece, 
logging every act of aggression, including karate moves, hitting, pushing and 
stealing. They found that the children who had just watched "Power Rangers" 
were aggressive six times more often than the children who had not watched the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 The children who had watched "Power Rangers" imitated the martial arts 
sequences down to specific kicks, somersaults and arm movements -- even echoing 
the sounds that the characters made during the show's fight scenes, the 
researchers reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The monster battle scenes were part of a Japanese television program show from 
several years ago that has been dubbed and incorporated into "Mighty Morphin 
Power Rangers." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyatzis and his students are preparing their findings for submission to a 
psychology journal and have submitted them to the Social Ecology Research 
Conference to be held at UC Irvine in April. They have not heard if their paper 
has been accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyatzis said the brief study and small sample did not detract from the 
validity of the researchers' conclusions. "If we can get such heightened 
aggression from just one episode, then that's all the more reason to be 
alarmed," he said. He said the sample of 52 children was "legitimate" for 
research purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 The show grabbed headlines last year when it became the nation's top-ranked 
children's program and parents scrambled to find "Power Rangers" action figures 
in the midst of a Christmastime shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyatzis said he is one of those who has not joined the craze. "I have a 
daughter who's 7 1/2. I've never let her watch it and I probably never will."

A NEW COURSE; TEEN-AGE MARATHONERS AND THEIR 'CHIEF' STRIVE FOR PERSONAL BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANNE KLEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some will be running the Los Angeles Marathon on Sunday because it is there, 
because it is supposed to be one of those only in L.A. happenings, because 
somebody told them they had to be kidding at their age, or because they could 
use a new Mercedes and $15,000 cash. 
</P>
<P>
 And somewhere in this bobbing sea of 19,000 running shorts will be Roy 
Wiseman, striding forward for a far more personal cause: Martin Campos and his 
brother, Salvador. The teen-age brothers, too, will be running as if their very 
lives depended upon it, which in a way, is true. 
</P>
<P>
 For them, this marathon is not just a footrace. It is a glorious new proving 
ground, one that, a few years ago, they never dreamed they would enter. That 
was before they met Roy, the guy they love to call "Chief." He has shown them 
that ignorance corrupts, that barriers of race and class need not imprison 
hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiseman, who is black, is a successful engineer who remembers dining by 
candlelight as a child -- because his parents couldn't pay their electric bill. 
His father was a welder, his mother cleaned other people's homes. He is the 
only one in his family to go to college, at Ohio's Kent State. 
</P>
<P>
 The Campos brothers emigrated from El Salvador a decade ago. Now their father, 
a plumber, heads to a Pasadena street corner every day in search of odd jobs. 
Their mother put herself through beauty school with the money she earned 
cleaning offices at night. Today she cuts hair at the beauty salon of a 
department store. 
</P>
<P>
 So what are a few blisters among friends? These guys will be running the 
marathon because sometimes, physical pain is balm for the soul. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my friends said, 'You're not going to make it, you're going to go 
splat. You're going to die,' " said Martin, a sixth-grader who is 13 years old. 
"Then I go, 'Nah. I can make it. I already did 21 miles.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And that run was with Roy, of course. Wiseman, 40, pulled the same 
psychological tricks on Salvador two years ago when he was 14. The two set out 
at the start of the 1992 Los Angeles Marathon together, but after 18 miles, 
Wiseman shot ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "He left me on Wilshire! But I went on because I wanted to catch him. When I 
finished, it was bad, it was fresh!" Salvador said with pride. "And when I was 
running, people would say, 'Look at that little kid running!' I felt good 
because I was doing something that other people can't do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After pounding his way through more than a dozen Los Angeles neighborhoods, 
Salvador finished the 26.2-mile course in three hours and 42 minutes. It was 
the first time he had ever attempted such a monumental task. 
</P>
<P>
 The course record, set by Mexico's Martin Mondragon in 1988, is two hours, 10 
minutes and 19 seconds, although a marathon spokeswoman said most people take 
four to five hours. Some literally take all day. The race starts at 8:40 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 This year Salvador figures he and first-timer Martin should make it across the 
finish line outside the Coliseum in under four hours. "And my time next year is 
going to be three," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Running, however, is simply a metaphor that has echoed through Wiseman's 
attempts to do some good for youngsters who seemed to be throwing away their 
chances for success. He recalls that the first time Salvador visited him -- and 
was awed by the technical wizardry of his garage door opener -- the boy begged 
never to be sent home. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys' father says he was drinking heavily then. Their mother, Maria, says 
the constant tension in their home was taking its toll on everyone, including 
her. Her sons did not bother with their schoolwork. At home, peace meant 
watching TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiseman met Salvador after his employer, Allied Signal Technical Services -- a 
contractor to Pasadena's Jet Propulsion Laboratory -- "adopted" Wilson Junior 
High School, where Salvador was then in the sixth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiseman offered to tutor youngsters whom the principal had singled out for 
special help, and Salvador was one of four boys that Wiseman was assigned. 
Every Tuesday he visited the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, Salvador says, his short temper and stubbornness always entangled 
him in fights. There was always some issue he believed had to be settled with 
force. "I liked to intimidate people," Salvador said. "That would make me feel 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the opposite of what Wiseman is about. Violence has no place in his 
world; he finds his drama in sports. He climbs rocks, dives under water and 
through the sky, pilots airplanes and pedals bikes. Marathons, for him, are no 
big deal. His quiet and deliberate manner strongly suggests to his young 
friends that machismo does not make a man. 
</P>
<P>
 In the classroom, Wiseman talked to the youngsters as their friend, and he 
listened to them even more. A single man, he has no children of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then at the end of the school year, Wiseman suggested that his group take a 
celebratory camping trip. But only Salvador's parents showed up for the 
informational meeting that Wiseman had planned. So instead, Wiseman took 
Salvador and some of his friends to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first of many outings, including one to Washington, Virginia and 
Ohio, where Salvador was accepted by members of Wiseman's family as just folks. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't see a little Hispanic kid," Salvador said. "They saw Sal. That's 
why I felt good." 
</P>
<P>
 The Campos family, in turn, has accepted Wiseman as a blessing from God. He 
has helped them move from a Pasadena neighborhood that is rife with gangs and 
drugs and crime. The boys are in new schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Now their family rents a two-bedroom home that Wiseman owns in a quiet city 
neighborhood about two miles from where he lives in Pasadena. Their rent, 
however, does not cover Wiseman's mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 And the boys' father, inspired by the changes his sons have undergone, has 
been sober for more than a year. At the age of 44, he is studying toward a high 
school diploma. Now the whole family goes to church. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvador, in the meantime, has his career all figured it out. He will be a 
doctor when he grows up. And Martin? A professional soccer player, or maybe 
even a runner, who knows? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The wrong question to ask Wiseman is why he is doing all these things for 
people who were strangers not long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a why not," he said. "It's a part of who I am. When you see people in 
need, you try to help. You can always find reasons not to be involved. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Salvador was having great difficulties growing up. This little boy was really 
at risk. I had the opportunity to show him he was special. I had to give him 
confidence to know that he could change his environment. I'm really proud of 
him. He's come a long way. And, like all of us, he's got a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Maria, the boys' mother, said the one thing her family had wished for Wiseman 
was for him to find a wife. She said she thanks God that her prayers have come 
true. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiseman's marriage to Patty Hart is scheduled for July. He is building a 
steel-frame house in Sierra Madre where the couple will live with Hart's 
13-year-old daughter, and there will be room for more children. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'm going to be the best man in the wedding!" Salvador said. 
</P>
<P>
 This was news to Wiseman. But now that it has been proclaimed, Wiseman said he 
considers it done. After all, it was Salvador who got a peek at the engagement 
ring, even before Hart did. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the record, Wiseman's future wife said that she, too, plans to run her 
own marathon one day. A Rainy Race? 
</P>
<P>
 For today's Los Angeles Marathon, forecasters say a coastal low-pressure 
system will bring cool temperatures, brisk winds and a 40% likelihood of 
showers, possibly thunderstorms. High temperatures are expected in the low to 
mid-60s, with westerly winds of 15 m.p.h. to 20 m.p.h. under cloudy skies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although showers may keep spectators away, light precipitation and 
accompanying cool weather can make for fast times, said William A. Burke, the 
marathon's president and founder. Precipitation does have its practical 
drawbacks. Wet socks can cause blisters, and cool, wet weather may chill some 
runners. 
</P>
<P>
 It has only rained once in the marathon's nine-year history, a light early 
morning mist that dampened runners for an hour or so during the 1989 race. 
Marathon to Close Streets 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Marathon, which starts at 8:40 a.m. today, will force many 
street closures in central Los Angeles. Because of the added congestion, 
motorists are asked to avoid the I-10 between the 110 and 405 freeways from 9 
a.m. to 3:45 p.m. Motorists are also asked to avoid unnecessary travel in the 
La Brea Avenue / Crenshaw Boulevard corridor. Off-ramps will be closed on the 
I-10 at Crenshaw, the 101 at Vine, Gower and Hollywood and the 110 at 6th.

BILL BOYARSKY: LEGISLATIVE SLEIGHT OF HAND SUSPENDS LOBBYIST MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I've been intrigued by the bottomless bag of tricks the Los Angeles City 
Council has used over the past 20 months to kill a lobbyist control law. 
</P>
<P>
 With chief magician Richard Alatorre orchestrating the show, the council, 
through its Rules and Elections Committee, has been highly imaginative in its 
efforts to prevent increased regulation of lobbyists. That is understandable. 
Campaign contributions by lobbyists and their business employers are the grease 
that makes the wheels of government turn quickly for those sophisticated or 
rich enough to know how to manipulate the system. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier column, I reported how the committee members -- Chairman 
Alatorre, Council President John Ferraro and Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky -- were 
pulling the old legislative trick of "loving a bill to death." This is when 
opponents, professing undying affection for a measure, load it up with so many 
complicated and cumbersome amendments that nobody can vote for it. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, all their amendments and delays add up to another old legislative 
trick, imprisoning a bill in a committee. In this case, opponents have been 
holding the new lobby control law prisoner in Alatorre's committee, under a 
life sentence without possibility of parole. Their apparent hope is that the 
public and the press will forget about the issue. In that way, the measure can 
be killed without council members ever having to vote against it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The intent of the proposed law is to make it easier to shine the bright light 
of disclosure on the hidden relationships between the lobbyists, the people who 
employ them and the lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 We already have such disclosure to some extent. The current lobby control law 
requires anyone who is paid to influence legislation to report what they earn 
and who pays them. The reports, issued periodically by the city Ethics 
Commission, make for revealing reading. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the Lockheed Air Terminal firm is negotiating a contract to 
maintain equipment at a Los Angeles International Airport aircraft parking 
facility and a terminal. This requires extensive negotiations with the Airport 
Commission, a bewildering maze even for a corporation as big as Lockheed. So 
Lockheed paid $45,000 in the last three months to six lobbyists from three 
lobbying firms run by City Hall insiders -- Fitch/Davis Associates, Rose and 
Kindel and Fran Savitch and Associates. The firms are substantial contributors 
to City Council members' campaigns. There is nothing wrong or illegal about 
these contributions, by the way. It's just good to know who's influencing whom. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the present law looks tough on the surface, it is full of loopholes. 
The major one is that lawyers who are lobbyists do not have to register on the 
grounds that they are protected by the privacy rights of the attorney-client 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 So, the current law nets the little fish. Even Sister Diane Donoghue, a nun 
who heads a nonprofit organization that builds housing for the poor, was asked 
to register. That's because she occasionally testifies for her organization's 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 But the big fish, the powerful lawyer lobbyists, get away. Among them is a 
shrewd attorney, former City Councilman Arthur K. Snyder, who knows -- or has 
invented -- just about every legislative trick known in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Ethics Commission, which wrote the new law, has been trying without 
success to persuade Alatorre to release the measure from the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre keeps finding new delays. For example, he asked the council's chief 
legislative analyst, Ron Deaton, for an analysis of the commission proposal. 
Nothing could be done, Alatorre said, until he had this important analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 Deaton prides himself on being energetic, but in this case his office was 
struck by unaccustomed lethargy. Finally, commission staff member LeeAnn Pelham 
wrote an exasperated letter to Chris O'Donnell, the Deaton aide assigned to the 
project. She reminded O'Donnell that he had promised to work over a weekend to 
finish the analysis. "To date, despite repeated requests, we have not heard 
back from you about whether your report has been completed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But her sharp words failed to stir action. On Feb. 28, commission Executive 
Director Ben Bycel stepped in. He wrote a memo to the chief legislative 
analyst. "Dear Ron. Since you have not returned my phone calls, I thought it 
would be more expeditious to communicate with you in writing regarding the 
proposed lobbying ordinance." He pleaded for the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-awaited report surfaced Tuesday, and it asked many more questions, 
indicating another delay. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Alatorre if there would ever be a hearing. He said that when the 
Ethics Commission answers the questions raised in the report, "I will schedule 
it at the next available meeting in the middle of the month, or at the latest 
the following month." 
</P>
<P>
 I remain doubtful. As I said, there's no bottom to the City Council's bag of 
tricks.

RECORD STORE OWNER IS SHOT TO DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Minutes after record store merchant Piedad Michel Preciado opened her shop of 
nine years for business Saturday she was gunned down by two men in an apparent 
robbery attempt, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fatally wounded, the 50-year-old mother of three staggered about seven steps 
outside the Discoteca Guadalajara at 2100 S. Bristol Street before she 
collapsed on the sidewalk where one of her employees came upon her. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the attack happened at 10:15 a.m. as Preciado was cleaning the 
store's glass display cases. The two men confronted her, shooting her once in 
the head, according to Sgt. Dick Faust. 
</P>
<P>
 The two suspects fled in a late 1960s or early 1970s model described as a 
beige, two-door compact hatchback with zebra-patterned seat covers, Faust said. 
Investigators have not determined if the men took anything from the store, but 
said robbery was the likely motive for the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Preciado was taken to Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, where she was pronounced 
dead.

HOMETOWN HEROES; LAGUNA'S PATRIOT'S DAY PARADE RECALLS MORE RECENT BATTLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It was their first time marching together in the annual Patriot's Day Parade 
here Saturday morning. They hope there won't be a next time. 
</P>
<P>
 The two dozen people walking under a bright banner proclaiming "Thanks to 
Everyone" lost homes or endured serious damage in last February's mudslides and 
the Oct. 27 firestorm that ravaged this pristine beach community. They are are 
busy trying to replace them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an exciting rebuilding time," said Ken Crumley, 61, who walked the 
parade route triumphantly holding aloft the blueprints for a new home that will 
replace the one in Mystic Hills where he had lived for almost 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The neighbors have locked arms. We used to know eight neighbors, now we know 
200. There's no place like Laguna Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 For many of the thousands of spectators and participants at the 28th annual 
Patriot's Day Parade, spending an hour and a half downtown with friends and 
neighbors just as they have every year was a way to celebrate the sense of 
community that blossomed among the ashes left by the wildfire. 
</P>
<P>
 "With everything we've been through in the past few months, this is great," 
said Laguna Beach resident Tammy Gutierrez, 29, who brought her balloon-toting 
sons, Jerry and Corey, to see the marching bands, show horses and classic cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez said she remembers how frightened she was when she rushed home from 
work to evacuate her home when the fire broke out, and is glad that day is 
behind her. "The parade says, 'We're going to make it. We're getting through it 
as best we can,' " said Gutierrez, whose home was not damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Patriot's Day is the remembrance of the battles of Lexington and Concord, 
which began the American Revolution. It is a legal holiday in Massachusetts, 
where it is celebrated on the third Monday in April, because the battles in 
which eight American revolutionaries died occurred on April 19, 1775. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Beach parade is always long on national pride. Saturday was no 
exception, as people of all ages sitting along the route waved tiny American 
flags while the Laguna Beach Elementary Band banged out "Yankee Doodle Dandy." 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, the shiny fire engine and fire survivors' float that rolled 
down Forest Avenue decorated with a partial house frame overshadowed parade 
mainstays such as the Daughters of the American Revolution entry and the local 
Veterans of Foreign Wars post contingent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get on your feet and give them a big round of applause," the parade announcer 
urged as the Laguna Beach firefighters traveled past. "A lot more homes would 
have been lost if not for these hardy souls." 
</P>
<P>
 The standing ovation continued as the rebuilding homeowners came by, toting 
house plans, brooms and hammers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have those plans been approved by the city yet?" the announcer joked, adding 
in a more serious tone, "We should thank you for showing us what people can do 
when they work together."

STUDENTS' CONVENTION FAVORS '3-STRIKES' LAW, BROWN FOR GOVERNOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN RAY BALLOU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 150 students gathered at a high school here Saturday to debate current 
events, tackling Tonya Harding and freedom of expression, illegal immigration 
and California's "three strikes" legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 They took a straw poll and decided that state Treasurer Kathleen Brown should 
be the next governor. And they said executions should not be shown on 
television and declared that the quality of life is declining across the board. 
Some students, such as Louise Chin, were interested in an issue that hit closer 
to home: school dress codes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some students just like to wear baggy pants. That doesn't mean that they have 
any type of gang affiliation," said Chin, a junior at Sunny Hills High School, 
where the debate was held. "If administrators are given this type of power, 
where do they draw the line on what can and cannot be worn?" 
</P>
<P>
 But David Rand, a senior at El Camino High School in Placentia, countered that 
baggy clothing is an integral part of the gang society and leads to hostility 
on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in an age where people are bringing guns to school," he said. 
"Certain clothing, without a doubt, is part of gang identity, and that identity 
at school leads to tensions." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chin disagreed, saying, "I don't think it's the school's place to say that 
baggy pants promote violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Many students agreed with Chin, saying that their choice of clothes is no more 
than a fashion statement and a way to express themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I dress has nothing to do with gangbanging," said one teen-ager 
wearing baggy pants and a blue bandanna on her head. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of each debate, a vote was taken to determine whether the group 
supported the resolution being discussed. The verdict on dress codes: They 
violate freedom of expression. 
</P>
<P>
 The debates were part of the Junior State of America's annual convention, held 
annually in Orange County and across the United States since 1934. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 local schools were represented in this year's convention. 
</P>
<P>
 "These meetings are designed to broaden student awareness of different social 
and political matters, said Massy Tadjedin, a junior at Sunny Hills High School 
in Fullerton who has attended the meetings since she was a freshman. She served 
as "mayor" of the convention Saturday and said the conventions "have had a 
direct effect on administrative policy in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "This convention gives students the chance to voice their opinions. High 
school is a time that students begin to develop some of the beliefs that they 
will carry throughout life," Tadjedin said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The students began the day by listening to state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los 
Angeles), who discussed how young teens could become more involved in issues 
confronting the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The students then broke off in several small groups to discuss their opinions 
on 10 topics. 
</P>
<P>
 In the straw poll on the governor's race, incumbent Pete Wilson came in second 
behind Brown, who received 34% of the vote, compared to 18% for Wilson. State 
Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi edged out state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa 
Monica) for third place in the poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers broke up into groups of 20 to consider various resolutions, 
with the various groups deciding that: Criminals convicted of three violent 
crimes should be sentenced to life in prison; children of illegal immigrants 
should be allowed to attend public schools; dress codes violate freedom of 
speech; ice skater Tonya Harding was responsible for Nancy Kerrigan's injury; 
and the qualify of life is getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those resolutions the students voted down: showing executions on TV and 
requiring religious studies as a state graduation requirement.

SLAIN WOMAN'S FAMILY POSTING FLYERS SEEKING CLUES TO HER DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The family of slain college student Cathy Torrez distributed flyers Saturday 
in the hopes of finding someone who may have seen her assailant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't sit home twiddling our thumbs and not do anything," said Mary 
Bennett, Torrez's mother."We have to do something." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said she and her children copied and distributed about 400 flyers 
Saturday morning. The flyers featured a photograph of Torrez's 1990 burgundy 
Toyota Corolla with license plate number 2RMC785.  
</P>
<P>
 Family members and friends posted the flyers, in Spanish and English, at the 
shopping center where she worked and along the route Torrez typically drove 
home, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrez, 20, was last seen driving the car on Feb. 12 at 8 p.m., leaving the 
Sav-On parking lot at 150 E. Yorba Linda Blvd. in Placentia.  
</P>
<P>
 The college student's body was discovered Feb. 19 in the trunk of her car in 
the parking lot of Placentia-Linda Community Hospital. She was stabbed to 
death. Hospital employees first noticed the car in the parking lot Feb. 14, but 
did not call police because they did not know it had been reported missing, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A reward of $30,000 has been offered for any information leading to the arrest 
and conviction of Torrez's assailant. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said she spoke to Placentia Police Chief Manuel Ortega on Friday, and 
he provided a photograph of the car for use on the family's flyer. Placentia 
police said there are no new leads in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrez's family asked that anyone who saw someone approaching or driving the 
car the night of Feb. 12 contact Placentia police at (714) 993-8164.

CONSERVATIVES SAY CLINTON HEALTH CARE BILL NEEDS MAJOR SURGERY; POLITICS: 
SUCCESSION OF MOSTLY REPUBLICAN SPEAKERS AT TOWN HALL MEETING CRITICIZE 
PRESIDENT'S PACKAGE AS TOO RELIANT ON BUREAUCRATS AND A POTENTIAL DISASTER. 
MOST PRESCRIBE PARED-DOWN ALTERNATIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With President Clinton campaigning to rescue his health care reform package, 
conservatives gathered here Saturday in a mostly Republican-led effort to rally 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 A parade of speakers from Sacramento, Dallas and Washington characterized the 
Clinton plan as a potentially disastrous bid to cover only 2.5% of the 
population that is chronically without medical insurance while lowering the 
standard of care for everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have a bitter battle over health care," said Rep. Ed Royce 
(R-Fullerton), who co-sponsored the town hall meeting held in the Sequoia 
Center. "The big question is, who will be running the show? I'm not inclined to 
put one-seventh of the nation's economy in the hands of bureaucrats." 
</P>
<P>
 Royce complained that the Clinton health bill now before Congress will produce 
a "top-down welfare state approach to health care." 
</P>
<P>
 He cited provisions that would allow a national board to determine how many 
medical students would be allowed in certain medical specialties, price 
controls on pharmaceuticals that don't take into account how many new drugs are 
developed but never make it to market, and limits on choice of doctors. Royce 
also cited long waits for some types of care and surgeries in Canada, which is 
often held up as a model for universal health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Royce, who moderated the town hall meeting, said he favors reforms less 
ambitious than the Clinton plan, such as making medical benefits stable and 
portable for people who change employers, elimination of exclusions for 
pre-existing conditions, a 100% tax deduction for medical insurance premiums, 
and creation of medical savings accounts that can refund unused cash and earned 
interest each year if employees don't spend all of the money in their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody spoke in favor of the Clinton plan, or for anything resembling it.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has said his plan should be given a chance to work before politician 
opponents and special interest groups dismantle it. And he has argued that some 
of the government controls included in the plan are necessary to keep doctors 
and hospitals from using often costly, unnecessary medical tests and procedures 
for simple medical problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael D. Tanner of the conservative Cato Institute in Washington, one of 
several speakers who addressed about 200 people who attended the town hall 
meeting, told horror stories about patients in Canada who had died while 
waiting months, if not years, for severely restricted cardiac and cancer 
operations. He predicted that U.S. health care would be similar under Clinton's 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress, said Tanner, would have the power to determine which medical 
procedures would be covered by health insurance, making the entire process 
political. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanner complained that traditional choose-your-own-doctor options won't be 
available because the Clinton plan allows health alliances to stop offering 
them if their costs grow too much. 
</P>
<P>
 And Tanner criticized some Republicans in Congress for not resisting the 
temptation to pass less-onerous versions of the same legislation, which he 
called "Clinton Lite." 
</P>
<P>
 Some speakers said they were nonpartisan, but bashed Clinton and the Democrats 
anyway. One said he was only quoting from the Clinton legislation and wasn't 
giving his own opinions, but then did so frequently, criticizing provisions 
that would pay for abortions and would provide care in some instances to people 
in the work force who aren't U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a race issue," said the speaker, Michael D. Pettengill of the 
Sacramento-based Capitol Resource Institute, but whether "you want your money 
to pay for a Canadian, a Mexican or someone from France." 
</P>
<P>
 Few in the audience challenged the panelists. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman, who sells insurance, told the gathering that while medical savings 
accounts are logical, "the MTV generation elected Bill Clinton, and medical 
savings accounts are not a feel-good kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 And psychologist Bruce Webster complained that managed-choice types of medical 
plans can lead to major bureaucratic inefficiencies, including huge 
administrative costs. For example, he cited Medco chief Martin J. Wygot, who 
recently paid himself a $30-million salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Webster described the town hall meeting as "very anti-Clinton and 
party-line Republican" but is worried that managed care will "operate 
unchecked." 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the medical savings account idea," Webster added, "but it does not 
have much support on Capitol Hill."

INMATE CALLED SUSPECT IN 1981 KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 12 years after a Santa Ana man was found stabbed to death in a dirt 
planter, investigators say they have identified his killer: a prison inmate 
serving time for another crime. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, a Westminster judge issued an arrest warrant for Jerry Glenn (Red 
Dog) Williams, 41, for the murder of Clyde Dwain Ward in October, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Williams, formerly of Westminster, stabbed Ward and dumped his 
body in a planter beside a building, formerly Keystone Savings & Loan, at 14011 
Beach Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators did not disclose the suspected motive for the killing of Ward, a 
28-year-old Santa Ana resident at the time of his death. Informants led 
investigators to Williams, who is in prison for an unrelated crime, Westminster 
Police Sgt. Dave Stronach said.

MAN FLEES WITH CASH IN BANK HOLDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man held up a bank here Saturday, stuffing $528 in cash in a briefcase 
before walking out, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man walked into the Bank of America at 26821 Trabuco Road about 9:05 a.m., 
handed a teller a note and demanded money, Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Jay 
Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teller handed over the cash, which the robber placed in a brown portfolio 
before leaving, Mendez said. No one was hurt and no weapon was seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the robber was white, had a round face, blue eyes and wore 
wire-rimmed glasses. He appeared to be in his mid-40s, 6 foot 2 and weighing 
210 pounds, Mendez said. The robber had short blondish-red hair and wore a 
white T-shirt and white baseball cap, he said.

HOLDUP MAY BE LINKED TO TO KILLER OF 2 OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police said Saturday that authorities are investigating whether the gunman who 
killed two police officers at a Torrance Holiday Inn also may have robbed a 
Gardena real estate office last summer in a holdup that resembled the fatal 
Valentine's Day attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardena Police Lt. David Morgan said Torrance detectives have notified his 
department that they are looking into a possible link between the hotel 
slayings and the Gardena robbery, which occurred June 11 when a masked man 
burst into the C & C Real Estate office and tied up five people before fleeing 
with their cash and ATM cards. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, the gunman covered his face with dark netting, wore 
military-style gear, wielded a gun equipped with a silencer and carried a bag 
filled with flexible plastic handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at the crime reports, there are some similarities," Morgan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Torrance-based Daily Breeze reported in Saturday's editions that driver's 
licenses belonging to two of the Gardena robbery victims were found in David J. 
Fukuto's possession after he was killed by officers during his Feb. 14 attack 
on a Holiday Inn motivational seminar attended by Palos Verdes Estates police. 
</P>
<P>
 Akira Tabata, 45, of Gardena said police found his stolen license while 
searching Fukuto's Mid-City home, according to the newspaper report. Eiji 
Daimon, 33, of El Sereno said his license was found in Fukuto's wallet. Neither 
could be immediately reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Top commanders on duty Saturday at the Torrance and Gardena police stations 
said they were unable to confirm accounts offered by the two victims.

MAN CRITICALLY WOUNDED IN STREET ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 22-year-old man remained in critical condition Saturday after he was shot in 
the chest, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators found Laguna Santos of Santa Ana lying in the street on the 200 
block of East 4th Street at 2 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Santos appeared to have run at least half a block east on 4th Street before he 
collapsed, Sgt. Dick Faust said. Witnesses to the shooting left the area before 
officers arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics treated Santos at the scene and took him to Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana, where he later underwent surgery, Faust said.  
</P>
<P>
 The motive for the shooting is unknown, police said. No weapon was recovered 
and no arrests were made Saturday.

LIFEGUARDS HELP PULL PEOPLE FROM BOAT NEAR PIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 22-foot cabin cruiser with transmission problems foundered in the surf 
Saturday night, injuring two people and prompting an unusual sea rescue by city 
lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
 The five people aboard -- including a 3-year-old boy -- navigated the boat 
into the surf south of the Huntington Beach Pier at 6:25 p.m., drawing the 
attention of a city lifeguard who ran to grab the child out of the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifeguard Mike Bartlett said that the four adults then jumped out of the boat, 
which was left bobbing in the waves until a five-ton tow truck could be located 
to drag the vessel from the water and across the sand.  
</P>
<P>
 Bartlett said two of the passengers were later taken to a hospital for 
treatment of minor injuries.

2 TEENS STABBED IN FIGHT AT RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One youth was shot and stabbed and another was knifed in the back during a 
melee at a Huntington Beach fast food restaurant, police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old youth who was shot and stabbed was taken to UCI Medical 
Center, where he was in fair condition Saturday, Lt. Luis Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-year-old boy who was stabbed was treated at Huntington Beach Medical 
Center and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told investigators that five to eight young men got into a fight 
with the two victims about 10:15 p.m. Friday at a Taco Bell restaurant at 16431 
Bolsa Chica Blvd., police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After attacking the two youths, the unidentified assailants jumped into two 
dark compact cars and sped away, police said. No weapons were recovered and 
police have made no arrests.

MATER DEI STRUGGLES IN VICTORY; PREP BASKETBALL: FREE-THROW SHOOTING SAVES 
MONARCHS IN THE END AND THEY DEFEAT EDISON, 65-59.

 It was supposed to be effortless. Over by halftime at the latest. A real 
yawner. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody was yawning Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Undefeated Santa Ana Mater Dei, The Times No. 1-ranked team, couldn't pull 
clear of Huntington Beach Edison and needed strong free-throw shooting in the 
final minute to win, 65-59, and take the Southern Section Division I-A 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 At Anaheim Arena, the section set an evening session attendance record of 
13,395. The total for the day was 25,739. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers (19-10), who came in fourth in the Sunset League, needed a 
tiebreaking playoff win to receive a berth to the section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gave us a run like no one has in a long time," said guard Miles Simon, 
who had a game-high 26 points. "They came out and they played a lot tougher and 
harder than we thought they would. I don't know how they finished fourth in 
their league." 
</P>
<P>
 Schea Cotton had 25 for Mater Dei (31-0). 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs won their ninth Southern Section championship in 12 years, all 
under Coach Gary McKnight. 
</P>
<P>
 But while they expected to win, this was not what they had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading, 49-36, entering the fourth quarter, the Monarchs seemed to relax and 
the Chargers took advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Ben Beard (24 points), the Chargers rallied and trailed, 59-55, with 58 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 But Simon, the Monarch point guard, went on to hit six free throws to ensure 
the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-point differential was a shock. During South Coast League play this 
season, no team came within 18 points of the Monarchs. In four previous playoff 
games, only Loyola gave Mater Dei a run before folding, 78-60. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first half, the Monarchs could not rid themselves of the Chargers. 
Taking a 14-8 lead into the second quarter, Mater Dei catapulted to a 22-11 
advantage on two baskets apiece by Simon and freshman Schea Cotton with 5:49 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 After increasing their lead to 30-18, the Monarchs let the Chargers close to 
32-22 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just went through a couple lapses where we let people get away," said 
Edison Coach Larry Hirst. "It seemed like Mater Dei was going to capitalize on 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 This title marks the second consecutive season the Monarchs have beaten a 
Sunset League team in the final. Last season Mater Dei beat Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The height of the Monarchs' starting team (6 feet 7, 6-6, 6-6, 6-4, 6-2) could 
match up with a number of Division I college teams. The Edison guards, Corey 
Smith and Jason Koerner, stand 5-11 and 5-7, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers' road to their first-ever championship appearance was 
challenging. They rallied from a 17-point fourth-quarter deficit to beat Santa 
Ana Servite in double-overtime to finish tied for fourth in the Sunset League. 
Then they beat Huntington Beach Ocean View to gain the league's fourth playoff 
berth.

DE LA HOYA ADDS BELT TO JEWELRY COLLECTION; BOXING: 1992 GOLD MEDALIST WINS HIS 
FIRST TITLE BY STOPPING BREDAHL AFTER 10 ROUNDS. TONEY SURVIVES A NASTY CUT TO 
BEAT LITTLES.

<P>
 Looking at times frustrated, at times flawless, Oscar De La Hoya chased down 
and finally beat down Jimmi Bredahl to win on a technical knockout after 10 
rounds Saturday night at the reopening of the Olympic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympic crowd of 5,843, clearly looking for an early De La Hoya knockout, 
grew slightly restless as the fight wore on, but De La Hoya never lost control 
of the bout. 
</P>
<P>
 In the evening's co-feature, International Boxing Federation 
super-middleweight champion James Toney took a bloody fourth-round technical 
knockout over No. 1 contender Tim Littles. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya scored hard knockdowns in the first and second rounds, and Bredahl 
backpedaled the rest of the fight. Upon Dr. Adam Karns' advice, with Bredahl's 
right eye nearly swollen shut and his face covered with welts, the referee 
stopped the fight before the 11th round began. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gave De La Hoya (12-0, 11 knockouts) his first world title, the 
World Boxing Organization junior-lightweight championship, which is not 
considered a major title. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I really wanted to do was make him suffer," De La Hoya said. "Because he 
was saying things, like dropping me in the first round. So I wanted to hurt him 
and end the fight on my terms. Which is what I did." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya, 21, who after the fight said he never wanted to fight another 
left-hander again, said he had trouble landing combinations because of 
Bredahl's evasive tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very, very frustrating," De La Hoya said. "The way he was grabbing me, 
then running for his life, it was very tough to finish him off." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya sent Bredahl to the canvas midway through the first round with his 
first meaningful punch -- a straight right hand to the chin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first knockdown, it was sitting in my body the rest of the fight," 
Bredahl said. "He was punching hard, yes he was. Not punching hard, maybe, but 
punching clean. And that hurts very much." 
</P>
<P>
 Bredahl (16-1), from Denmark, was knocked down again the second round by a 
flurry begun by a left hook to the head, and began his clutching-and-running 
maneuvering from then on. 
</P>
<P>
 Bredahl said he hoped to wear down De La Hoya, who weighed in Saturday morning 
at 128 3/4 pounds, more than two pounds lighter than at any time in his 
professional career. The junior-lightweight limit is 130, which is what Bredahl 
weighed. 
</P>
<P>
 "My strategy was to kill his stomach," Bredahl said. "But he killed my face 
first." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya won every round on every one of the judges' cards, and through the 
middle rounds piled up the damage to Bredahl's face. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya, however, eschewed the normal tactic against backpedaling opponents 
-- hard body shots -- because he said he was never sure which way Bredahl would 
dance when he charged him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just stalking him," De La Hoya said. "I knew he was going to get tired 
and that I'd get to him." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 10th, Bredahl clearly began to tire, and De La Hoya scored his third 
knockdown of the fight with a sharp right hand to the side of Bredahl's head 
early in the round. 
</P>
<P>
 For the rest of the round, Bredahl didn't throw any punches, trying only to 
survive, and he did not protest when the fight was stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time De La Hoya has fought past the eighth round. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya said he would defend the WBO title one more time -- probably in May 
in Las Vegas -- then move up to the 135-pound lightweight division. After the 
May fight -- against an opponent to be determined -- his first lightweight bout 
will probably be against Jorge Paez. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a world title," De La Hoya said of the WBO belt. "It means a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Toney fight, with the ringside doctor threatening to halt the fight 
because of a deep gash over Toney's eye caused by a Littles' head butt, Toney 
took care of that decision on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 A stoppage would have made the decision a draw. Toney (42-0-2, 28 KOs) 
suffered the cut on a butt by Littles after the third round, and he was 
bleeding profusely between rounds and into the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 After a slow start, Toney began finding Littles with bruising rights in the 
third -- landing a hard left hook that dazed Littles and gaining a knockdown 
with three rights to the chin. 
</P>
<P>
 Told by ringside physician Robert Karns between the third and fourth that he 
might have to stop the fight soon, Toney blitzed Littles furiously, blasting 
him with a right to the chin 20 seconds into the round, then forcing referee 
Pat Russell to stop the fight at 1:03 after sending Littles (24-1) flat on his 
back with a vicious right. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the doctor said that, I thought, 'Oh man, I've got to do it now,' " 
Toney said. "I pushed the button." 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Jackie Kallen said of the cut: "It scared me to death." 
</P>
<P>
 Toney said it took 12 stitches to close the long gash and that he would 
probably have to take extra time off. 
</P>
<P>
 Toney's belt was not in danger by the cut because under IBF rules, if a 
fighter is cut on a butt and is forced to stop before six rounds are over, the 
bout is declared a technical draw. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier fight between young welterweights, Bronco McKart raised his 
record to 16-1 with nine knockouts by taking a sixth-round technical knockout 
over Skipper Kelp (18-2-1).

MIKE DOWNEY: BOXING OF OLYMPIC PROPORTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This was a glorious night for the fighting city of Los Angeles. Turning back 
our clocks not an hour but to another age when this was, pound for pound, one 
of the great boxing towns in the business, Saturday night's grand re- opening 
of the Grand Olympic Auditorium was like showtime at the Apollo. It had 
glamour, grandeur and so much entertainment that, well, the joint was jumping 
again, just like old times. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight card itself was a snappy and colorful one, from a boxing Elvis 
impersonator who got punched all the way down to the end of Lonely Street to 
the worth-waiting-for main event that featured another Oscar-winning 
performance by East L.A.'s golden boy, Oscar De La Hoya. ODLH won by TKO after 
spending 10 rounds turning the face of one Jimmi Bredahl the color of a ripe 
plum. (They should call him Jimm because the I is closed.) 
</P>
<P>
 The real star of the show, though, was the old hall itself. Seventy years ago, 
Jack Dempsey dug up the first shovel of dirt and Rudolph Valentino eventually 
sat ringside on opening night. When the doors swung open Saturday for the first 
time since 1987, champions of old from Ingemar Johansen to George Foreman took 
seats close to the action in their tuxes, several Hollywood heavyweights made 
themselves comfortable nearby and hundreds of old-fashioned fight fans occupied 
the balcony, filling the corner of 18th & Grand with familiar noise. 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympic was back in business. 
</P>
<P>
 What a swell place for a revival meeting. Spruced up, freshly scrubbed, wiped 
clean like a kid's face full of peanut butter and jelly, the Olympic was 
shining again. This landmark where Gorgeous George once grappled and preened, 
where Sugar Ray Robinson and Gene Fullmer traded blows, where Depression era 
amateurs fought for Olympic gold and where L.A. Thunderbird roller-derby 
jammers cracked the whip, had sprung back to life, full of sound and fury and 
signifying a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply stepping inside was a treat. It was like prying loose plywood boards 
from dark doorways, then sneaking on tiptoe into a great metropolitan museum of 
art, long since shut. On came the chandelier lights and all the paintings were 
suddenly alive, having a party. There against a wall sat Whistler's mother, 
wearing stereo headphones, while a boy in blue stood wondering whether an 
earring would look cool with this outfit. Mona Lisa had a tattoo. It being the 
1990s now, this was modern art. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Arum, the fight promoter, compared the reopening of the Olympic to 
"reopening Ebbets Field to Dodger fans." 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty apt. Of course, even in Los Angeles instead of Brooklyn, the Dodgers 
probably wouldn't stick customers with the kind of ticket prices ol' Bob did on 
this occasion, which probably accounted for the number of empty seats in the 
mezzanine. Not everybody who adores boxing has half a C-note sitting around in 
his or her wallet with nothing better to do. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a full evening's entertainment, nevertheless. Once upon a time, the 
Olympic opened with a nice little 10-rounder between two flyweights, Jimmy 
McLarnin and Fidel LaBarba, that went the distance. For the opening of the new, 
improved Olympic, the inaugural opponents were a 266-pound Dane named Brian 
Nielsen who entered the ring wearing boxing trunks and a baseball cap and his 
opponent, a can of picante sauce named Ross Purity who hailed from Copenhagen's 
sister city, El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
 Not much of a fight -- Denmark fight fans will be happy to know their man won 
-- but the fun was simply beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Into the ring next stepped a character who was introduced as a Mr. Presley 
from Memphis, Tenn., who happened to be wearing a white cape sort of thing and 
thick black sideburns that began near his ear lobes and ended somewhere in the 
vicinity of his shoulders. Well, before you could count one for the money, two 
for the show, three to get ready and TKO, young Mr. Presley found himself with 
a unique horizontal view of the Olympic's fine new ceiling lights. The referee 
stepped in and called off the concert. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, most of the 7,600 seats were filling up. There was a time when this 
was a room where anyone from Al Jolson to Barbara Stanwyck might be seen 
calling out encouragement to some pug. Boxing always did bring out the stars at 
night, and among those representing the arts this time were Ryan O'Neal ("The 
Main Event") and Stan Shaw ("Harlem Nights"), both of whom portrayed fictional 
fighters on film; Cathy Moriarty ("Raging Bull"), who unforgettably played the 
non-fictional but equally unforgettable Vicki LaMotta, and, of course, Jack 
Nicholson, who generally prefers golf because it's non-violent. 
</P>
<P>
 They all saw a pretty bloody scrap between James Toney and Tim Littles for the 
IBF super-middleweight championship, eventually won by Toney with a punch that 
sent Littles reeling backward as though struck by a bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Toney had a face full of red when it ended, the result of a head butt, and 
left Littles with these loving parting words, "I told you he was a bum." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on came Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 Resplendent in gold, De La Hoya blew kisses and then put his hand to more 
practical purpose, lashing out at the face of Bredahl, who went down before 
George Foreman could swallow his first Dorito. But the young Dane was game. He 
got up, annoyed De La Hoya with a southpaw stance and got heavily into 
self-preservation, clinching whenever possible. This brought boos from the 
balcony -- again, like old times. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bredahl was told after round 10 to give his poor purplish face the rest 
of the night off, De La Hoya celebrated by leaping onto every turnbuckle and 
waving to his many fans. Oscar said afterward, "It was a great honor to fight 
in the Olympic. My grandfather fought here and my father fought here. This was 
great for Los Angeles and myself." 
</P>
<P>
 That it was.

BIG 'CAP PRODUCES BIG FLAP; HORSE RACING: THE WICKED NORTH IS HANDED ONLY THE 
THIRD DISQUALIFICATION IN RACE'S HISTORY, GIVING LONGSHOT STUKA THE VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 While the three stewards tried to sort out Saturday's $1-million Santa Anita 
Handicap, trainer Gary Jones stood on the track, waiting to see if his Stuka 
was going to earn $200,000 for running second or $550,000 for being moved up to 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't (disqualify a horse) in this prestigious of a race," Jones said. 
"This is like the Kentucky Derby. They never do anything in the Derby. I was 
back there with Fali Time (in 1984), and (Gate Dancer) had to almost knock my 
horse down before (the stewards) moved us up from fifth to fourth." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten minutes after the 57th Big 'Cap was over, Jones was happy to be wrong. He 
leaped in the air and let out a whoop when the numbers were changed on the tote 
board. After The Wicked North crossed the wire, a 1 1/2-length winner in 2:00 
for the 1 1/4 miles, the stewards disqualified him for interfering with 
Myrakalu near the three-sixteenths pole. Stuka was given the victory and The 
Wicked North, the 9-5 favorite, was dropped to fourth place, behind Myrakalu, a 
31-1 shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Bien Bien, the highweight at 120 pounds, finished 1 1/4 lengths behind Stuka 
and was moved up from third to second. Myrakalu, who missed third place by a 
nose, wound up with third place. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in the crowd of 34,138 booed Stuka, who paid $33.40, and jockey Chris 
Antley, and Mrs. Mark Kelly, who was in the winner's-circle party of Allen 
Paulson, Stuka's owner, was struck on the forehead by a cigarette lighter. Mike 
Willman, a broadcaster standing nearby, said he was struck in the back, 
probably by a ballpoint pen. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than an hour after the race, The Wicked North's owner, Phil Hersh, and 
trainer David Bernstein filed a protest over the stewards' decision with the 
California Horse Racing Board. A hearing will be scheduled within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuka had nothing to do with the tight quarters that caused the 
disqualification. The 4-year-old colt, whose only previous stakes victory came 
in November of 1992, was clear of the trouble on the outside. Despite Kent 
Desormeaux's left-handed whipping, The Wicked North came over in the path of 
Myrakalu, causing jockey Alex Solis to stand up in the irons. Hill Pass, the 
horse who had battled The Wicked North for the lead from the start, had already 
tired, and he was bumped by Myrakalu. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Myrakalu barely missed third place, the stewards were required by the 
rules of racing to make a change. "The rule says that if an incident 'costs a 
horse a placing,' then a change in the order of finish must be made," steward 
Pete Pedersen said. "We were lucky there wasn't an accident. It was only a 
matter of inches, but that's what this game is all about. This was a unanimous 
decision, and we were satisfied that there was room for the gray horse 
(Myrakalu) to get through, and then that room disappeared. If The Wicked North 
had maintained a straight course, he would have been all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Pedersen was also a steward in 1982, when John Henry and Perrault ran 1-2 in 
the Big 'Cap and their positions were reversed because the winner drifted out 
in the stretch. And he was also a steward at Hollywood Park in 1984, the first 
year of the Breeders' Cup, when Fran's Valentine was disqualified in the 
$1-million Juvenile Fillies and Outstandingly received the victory. Before 
Saturday, that was the only disqualification in a $1-million race. The only 
other disqualification of a winner in the Big 'Cap came in 1952, when Intent 
was moved down in favor of Miche. 
</P>
<P>
 Desormeaux, who would have earned 10% of the winning purse, stormed out of the 
winner's circle when the disqualification was announced. "Those blind . . . 
cost me $50,000," he said. "In all fairness, the only people who got shafted 
were the fans, because they picked the winner. When I go in to see the stewards 
(today), and before they try to give me (a suspension), I'm going to show them 
where the No. 1 horse (Hill Pass) was on the fence at the point of the elbow. 
When we straightened away turning for home, there's a whole horse you could fit 
on the rail. I came in maybe three inches. I thought the No. 1 horse was 
responsible. The films obviously showed this to me later. I just hope Stuka and 
company don't spend the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Solis saw the incident differently: "There was a lot of room for me to go 
through between horses, and (The Wicked North) came over right in front of me 
and squeezed me really hard against the other horse. I mean, (The Wicked North) 
was about three off the rail, and when I saw that, I went right into the hole." 
</P>
<P>
 Myrakalu was running for the first time on dirt. "It was a great effort," 
trainer Wayne Lukas said. "I think I had a legitimate shot to win the race." 
</P>
<P>
 This has been a tough winter for Hill Pass. He was disqualified to third place 
after finishing behind The Wicked North in the San Antonio Handicap three weeks 
ago. "I felt the shoulder of the gray horse (Myrakalu) hit my horse in the 
hip," said Hill Pass's jockey, Chris McCarron. "That kind of turned my horse 
out a little bit and knocked him off stride a little bit. Maybe that's why he 
stopped. I can only guess." 
</P>
<P>
 The owner and trainer of The Wicked North took the disqualification better 
than Desormeaux, who rode three winners Saturday, two of them for Gary Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "My horse was in the clear," Hersh said. "It was the inside horse who came 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Walking down the tunnel away from the track, Bernstein said: "I thought that 
my horse only came in a little. It was a tough call. I don't envy the stewards. 
I wouldn't have wanted to be in their place. I just hope there's a race down 
the road where we get another chance." Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Fly'n J. Bryan is even money and Tabasco Cat is 7-5 on the morning line for 
today's San Rafael Stakes. Flying Sensation is sore and has been scratched from 
the race. . . . Paseana is the 8-5 favorite for the Santa Margarita Handicap. . 
. . In another race Saturday, Strodes Creek won for the second time in three 
starts. . . . Saturday's handle of $17.4 million was the second highest in 
Santa Anita history. The record of $36.2 million came on Breeders' Cup day in 
November. A total of $8,202,350 was wagered on the Big 'Cap, also a record.

JIM MURRAY: HE'S JUST PETE -- BUT THAT'S PLENTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Americans like Pete Sampras for the same reasons they used to like Dempsey, 
Ruth, Red Grange, Walter Johnson, Joe Louis, John Wayne -- or even John Daly. 
They adore raw power. They revere the guy with the knockout punch, the home run 
swat, the explosive touchdown run, the 100-m.p.h. fastball. The quick draw in 
the western. Dirty Harry. The guy with the equalizer.  
</P>
<P>
 They like to think they're for the underdog. But underdogs don't sell tickets. 
They flock to see the guys named "Sultan of Swat," "Brown Bomber," "Galloping 
Ghost," "Big Train." Guys nicknamed "Rabbit" don't get it, don't fill seats. 
They get cult followings, not sellouts. "Charlie Hustle" is OK, but "Iron 
Horse" makes you reach for the wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 We have to get a nickname for Pete Sampras. "Pistol Pete?" Nah. Too trite. 
Besides, a 129-m.p.h. serve is not a pistol, it's a railroad gun. Big Bill 
(note the "Big") Tilden's serve like that was called "cannonball." 
</P>
<P>
 We don't like sending out a representative known as "Bunny" or "Bitsy." We 
like "Rocky." We want to play the Borises and Ivans and Stefans of the world 
with someone whose nom de games strikes terror.  
</P>
<P>
 But it's getting risky fastening a colorful nickname on a player in sport 
today. It can blow up in your face. The Ivans can all turn terrible, the 
cannonballs can become soap bubbles. It's getting so that John Wayne is getting 
killed in the third reel.  
</P>
<P>
 Take tennis. It used to be the most formful of all sports. It was a monarchy.  
</P>
<P>
 "Unknown Wins Open" was not even in the lexicography of the sport. Tennis was 
like the House of Tudor, a succession of kings. The crown was passed down. 
There was Tilden. Then there was Don Budge, followed by Jack Kramer, Lew Hoad, 
and then the great Laver, Connors and Borg. It was an aristocracy. Golf was a 
crapshoot by comparison.  
</P>
<P>
 But, today, it has become a lottery. Look at the Newsweek Champions Cup at the 
Hyatt Grand Champions resort here this week. Fourteen of the 18 top players in 
the world began this tournament. They were expected to run the ribbon clerks -- 
the unseeded -- out by nightfall Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the ribbon clerks began raking in all the pots. By week's end, they 
had run out of the game 1) Jim Courier, seeded second here and ranked No. 3 in 
the world; 2) Andre Agassi, winner of Wimbledon and 19 other world titles; 3) 
Sergi Bruguera, reigning French Open champion and No. 5 in the world; 4) Goran 
Ivanisevic, the Croatian crusher, Wimbledon finalist and a ball-basher who had 
957 aces to his credit last year; 5) Michael Chang, French Open champion and 
winner of this tournament two years ago, seeded No. 6 here and ranked No. 8 in 
the world; 6) Cedric Pioline, who reached the final in last year's U.S. Open, 
the first Frenchman in 64 years to do that; 7) Marc Rosset, winner of the gold 
medal in the Barcelona Olympics and No. 16 in the world.  
</P>
<P>
 And who had been left standing while all that carnage was being toted up? 
Well, there was one guy who was ranked No. 1,013 in the world, one guy who was 
99th and another who was 49th.  
</P>
<P>
 Guess who restored order? Well, it was our own tennis version of Clint 
Eastwood. The guy with the .357 Magnum. Pete Sampras. Wyatt Earp on a white 
horse. The marshal.  
</P>
<P>
 Pete put the ribbon clerks on the noon stage out of town -- with a little help 
from Stefan Edberg.  
</P>
<P>
 Just when it looked like the weekend would be for no-names only, Sampras and 
Edberg blasted into a semifinal pairing. A pity it was a semifinal, because 
this was a matchup worthy of Wimbledon. This was no semi-windup. This was 
Dempsey-Tunney.  
</P>
<P>
 Sampras is coming off a season in which he has won Wimbledon, the U.S. Open 
and the Australian Open in a row. And Edberg has won two Wimbledons, two U.S. 
Opens and two Australian Opens.  
</P>
<P>
 There is no trouble finding a nickname for Master Edberg. This is tennis' "Mr. 
Smooth." Edberg's nom de courts should be "the Mechanic." He plays tennis like 
the guy who came to fix the plumbing. He takes stock of the problem, drops his 
toolbox, ambles over to see exactly what it's going to take, then he proceeds 
methodically to find the leak in your game. He's as unemotional as a border 
guard. He doesn't play tennis, he performs it. Like surgery. He's as patient as 
Mother Teresa.  
</P>
<P>
 Playing Sampras in a three-set match is like fighting a bobcat in a closet. 
You don't have too much time to figure out strategy.  
</P>
<P>
 It's tough playing a guy when your best hope is that he will miss. It's like 
hoping the alligator doesn't see you.  
</P>
<P>
 "It takes you a set just to get used to the pace of that ball coming at you," 
Edberg admitted after losing to Sampras Saturday, 6-3, 3-6. 6-4. "By the time 
you get ready to hit it, it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras is No. 1 in the world because he's going in the game, so to speak, 
with a 54-card deck. That serve of his is worth 10 points a set. Those are 
points you more or less have to spot him. After all, he was the first guy in 
the game to have more than 1,000 aces (1,011) last year. You might be able to 
see his ball better in daylight, but the ball goes faster in light dry air. In 
other words, in a monsoon or under water, you might stand a chance. At sea 
level, forget it.  
</P>
<P>
 He served 15-to-20 m.p.h. faster than Edberg all afternoon Saturday in what 
could have been a preview of this year's Grand Slam finals. His balls came in 
at nuclear velocities -- 128, 122, 124 m.p.h. against Stefan's top of 110 and 
usual 100. Edberg needs only one breakthrough a set to win and he got it in the 
second set, 6-3, Saturday but, by the end of the third set, he looked like a 
guy caught in a rockslide.  
</P>
<P>
 You can see why Sampras needs a nickname. It has been a while since we had a 
Yank at court whose ball moves so fast it tends to disappear like a Koufax 
fastball on the way to the plate. We always find a sobriquet to fit our top 
guns. We haven't had one in tennis in this country in a while, leaning to guys 
who won with (ugh!) two-handed backhands.  
</P>
<P>
 Now we have a guy who wins the old-fashioned way, he knocks you out. When a 
guy in golf gets this unstoppable, he becomes "the Golden Bear." In basketball, 
he becomes "Air Jordan." 
</P>
<P>
 The times being what they are, it will probably have to be something like 
"Laser Pete." But the rest of tennis probably wishes they would just call him 
illegal. Or maybe just raise the net when he's serving. 
</P>
<P>

Slam Cup in December, challenges the No. 1 seed again in championship match at

MORNING BRIEFING: THEY CAN WALK ALL OVER YOU FOR ONLY $1,000 
</P>

 Want to have your name inscribed on a tile to be placed near the Rose Bowl 
game Hall of Fame, where the names of O.J. Simpson, Warren Moon, Jim Plunkett, 
Ernie Nevers and other New Year's Day players-of-the-game are engraved? 
</P>
<P>
 For $1,000, the Pasadena Chamber of Commerce will put your name on a tile in 
the Circle of Excellence Plaza at the entrance to the Rose Bowl. In addition, 
the $1,000 will entitle you to purchase a World Cup soccer game ticket at face 
value. Only one, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Add ego trip: For only $150, you can get a tile located in the plaza walkway 
-- where people can walk all over it. But you don't get to buy a World Cup 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: When David Robinson got 34 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists and 10 
blocked shots in a game last month, it was only the fourth quadruple-double in 
NBA history. Who got the other three? 
</P>
<P>
 Tough audience: The Pittsburgh Pirates recently added former pitcher Bob Walk 
to the team's radio-TV team. This prompted several comments from Pirate coach 
Rich Donnelly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe now he'll get a complete game," Donnelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 250 starts, Walk completed only 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Donnelley: "He's been second-guessing Jim (Leyland's) decisions for 
eight years. Now he can get paid for it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lip and the Babe: Leo Durocher's recent induction into the baseball Hall 
of Fame brings to mind Babe Ruth's nickname for his one-time New York Yankee 
pal -- "The All-American Out." 
</P>
<P>
 Durocher wasn't as bad as his reputation, however. He hit .286 in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
 That would get him $3 or $4 million these days. 
</P>
<P>
 A nice itch: When Wayne Gretzky breaks Gordie Howe's NHL scoring record of 801 
goals, it will be a bittersweet occasion for the Kings' captain because Howe 
has long been Gretzky's hockey idol. 
</P>
<P>
 "My best Christmas ever was when I was 5 years old and my dad -- I mean Santa 
Claus -- brought me a Gordie Howe sweater," he told Larry Wigge of the Sporting 
News. "I wouldn't take it off, even though it itched like crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Hakeem Olajawon, 1990; Alvin Robertson, 1986; and Nate 
Thurmond, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 The old hometown: After Dave Stewart had spent a few hours in a Tampa jail, 
the Toronto Blue Jay pitcher was asked if he was afraid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm from Oakland," he said. "There's not much I'm afraid of." 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Fred Couples, analyzing Johnny Miller's stunning victory at the 
AT&T Pebble Beach tournament after not having played for a year: "I know this 
sounds cruel, but (Miller's) win doesn't say a lot for our PGA Tour players."

GOLF ROUNDUP; MOCHRIE STARTS WITH EAGLE, ENDS WITH WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dottie Mochrie eagled the first hole and soared from there to win the 
inaugural LPGA Tournament of Champions by two strokes Saturday at Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner's two-hop, 122-yard shot wiped out Nancy Lopez's third-round lead, 
and Mochrie took over first-place for good with a five-foot birdie putt on No. 
8. 
</P>
<P>
 She bogeyed the last two holes, but managed to stay ahead because Lopez, who 
began the day with a one-shot lead over Betsy King, did the same to fall into a 
tie for second with Lauri Merten. 
</P>
<P>
 Mochrie finished with a four-day total of one-under-par 287 and earned 
$115,000. Lopez shot 73 and Merten, the only player to post three sub-par 
scores in the tournament, shot a 70 for a a 289. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the eighth victory for Mochrie, the 1992 LPGA player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An eagle on the first hole, a par five, was also the key score in the third 
round of the Doral-Ryder Open at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 It helped propel Billy Andrade to a six-under-par 66 and a two-stroke lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been putting good, playing good," Andrade said. "I just went out, real 
relaxed, no fear, and tried to put a good score on the board." 
</P>
<P>
 He did just that, completing three trips over Doral's Blue Monster course in 
204, 12 under par. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrade's chief challenger is Larry Nelson, who shot a 69.

TODAY, L.A. IS THE PLACE TO RUN; MARATHON: RACE WILL SERVE AS A SHOWCASE TO 
REST OF WORLD THAT CITY IS SURVIVING EARTHQUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A marathon as hardy as its participants will take place for the ninth 
consecutive year this morning, and this country's best female runner is ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I look at it is, when it is my turn to die, I will die, no matter 
where I'm at," Olga Appell said. "So I have no problem coming to Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 With a starting time runners dislike, amid surroundings that scare them, the 
Los Angeles Marathon will begin in front of the Coliseum at 8 a.m. for 
wheelchair competitors and at 8:40 for everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 A field of 19,000 runners is expected in pursuit of prize money that will 
include $15,000 and a Mercedes-Benz for the top male and female finishers. 
</P>
<P>
 While the event is being touted as a showcase for this city's ability to 
survive in the wake of the Jan. 17 earthquake, it is also an example of the 
race's resiliency. 
</P>
<P>
 No male who recorded among the world's 25 fastest times last year is here. The 
highest-ranking female is Appell, who is 15th in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the race has never been more popular, with nearly as many sponsors as 
runners and a telecast that will reach 133 countries. This includes five hours 
of live race coverage on Channel 13 in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could be not just our biggest race ever, but our most important race 
ever," said Bill Burke, marathon president. "We will show the world that Los 
Angeles is still standing." 
</P>
<P>
 If it is as hot as it was last year -- 87 degrees -- not all top runners will 
be standing. However, temperatures are expected to be in the 60s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, for the convenience of the runners and for the sake of better 
times, you would like this to start earlier," said Ed Eyestone, the top 
American hope who is coming off his first marathon victory, in Minneapolis last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we know there are other things to consider, like publicity and things. If 
you come to this race, you come knowing the conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 And this area's penchant for natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you think of the odds of another earthquake or mudslide or fire 
happening when we are here . . . well, I guess odds are pretty good," Eyestone 
said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the man with the second-fastest marathon time in history will be 
here, Ahmed Salah of Djibouti ran his 2:07:07 race nearly six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy's Luca Barzaghi, who ran a personal-best 2:10:53 last year in the World 
Cup, is the men's favorite. Salvador Garcia, who won the New York City Marathon 
two years ago, will also contend.

ROLLIE MASSIMINO COULDN'T HAVE ANTICIPATED IT WHEN HE MOVED FROM VILLANOVA TO 
NEVADA LAS VEGAS, BUT THROUGH LOSSES, BITTER FEUDS AND DESERTION BY FANS, HIS 
PROGRAM QUICKLY HAS BEEN . . . ; STRIPPED DOWN

 Who says they don't make sagas like they used to? Have you seen the one 
percolating in the desert lately? Bright lights . . . greed . . . jealousy . . 
. parade permits -- they're all here. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 The basketball coach looks as if the Thomas & Mack Arena is strapped to his 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 The school president, fresh from his job interview at Long Beach State, 
suddenly is very excited about the wonders of the Cal State university system. 
</P>
<P>
 The towel-sucking ex-coach has his own call-in radio show. 
</P>
<P>
 The ex-fans have speed dial. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining fans have plenty of leg room at home games. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, it's viva , Nevada Las Vegas, the longest running cat fight 
since Siegfried & Roy started snapping whips. This isn't high drama, it's low 
comedy. It's a B-movie with diplomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody despises somebody here. And if they don't, they will. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Runnin' Rebel Coach Rollie Massimino, 59 going on beleaguered, 
fires up hotter than a Jenn-Air if you mention the UNLV "booster" who keeps 
writing nasty letters to Vegas recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's UNLV President Robert Maxson, who shifts his frozen smile into 
cruise control whenever Jerry Tarkanian's name comes up. Tark, who provided the 
school with lots of wins, as well as NCAA infractions, says he won't give his 
seal of approval to the Massimino regime until Maxson is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Tarkanian loyalists boycott the games. In response, the 
Massimino loyalists do the Tammy Wynette thing, but it isn't easy. Just the 
other night at the near-vacant Thomas & Mack, they tried not to wince as the 
injury-riddled, mistake-prone Rebels lost to San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, which were less than three seasons ago, the Rebels used to 
treat teams such as San Jose like after-dinner toothpicks. Now UNLV (13-12) is 
reduced to hoping for the best, which in this case, would mean winning the Big 
West Conference tournament and the automatic NCAA postseason bid that comes 
with it. Otherwise, the Rebels miss out for the third consecutive year, twice 
by their own doing and once by NCAA probation. A string of 34 consecutive 
winning seasons is also at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, the whole situation is a mess, enough so that UNLV Athletic Director 
Jim Weaver is at a loss to explain it. Or resolve it, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "They haven't written the book how to deal with this one," he said. "It's so, 
you know, extenuating. There's nothing like it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stuck in the middle of all this is Massimino, who arrived from Villanova with 
a national championship ring on his finger, a sweetheart contract in his pocket 
and a squeaky clean record on his resume. What he didn't have was an 
appreciation for the depth of the feud between the Tarks and the Maxsons. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he does. In fact, ask him if he would do it all over again and Massimino 
takes a deep breath and pauses several seconds before answering. After all, 
diplomacy takes time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the challenge, because of the way Jim Weaver and the president 
presented it, if they did it again that way and told me what they told me . . . 
then yes," Massimino said. "Because it's probably the biggest challenge in my 
life and probably one of the biggest challenges of any person in sports. But 
what does that mean? Does it make me a martyr? No." 
</P>
<P>
 However, it does make him an easy target for the Maxson bashers, who would 
have found something wrong with whomever the school hired. Mother Teresa could 
have gotten the job and someone would have complained about the length of her 
habit. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, Massimino is no saint. The fuse to his temper is snipped crew-cut 
short these days, and on occasion the explosions require ear protection. At 
best, his relationship with the local media is civil, but testy. He has 
exchanged words and glares with hecklers. He has performed some vintage 
sideline temper tantrums, including a memorable fit during an 59-39 January 
loss to Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse yet, he made the mistake, if you can call it that, of telling an ESPN 
interviewer recently that basketball was "only a game," nothing more and 
nothing less. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, well, that might make the deans in the Ivy League happy, but it didn't go 
over real big on the Strip. Nor did it help when Tarkanian reminded viewers 
that it was a game, to be sure, but one that a UNLV coach had better win. 
</P>
<P>
 Also adding to Massimino's public-relations problems is a statement made the 
day he was hired two seasons ago. Standing at the podium, stern righteousness 
dripping from every word, Massimino announced that "in no way will any student 
athlete ever embarrass this university . . . ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Oops. Not only did the comment anger Tarkanian supporters, who thought 
Massimino was taking a cheap shot at their hero, but it also proved untrue. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this season, sophomore center Kebu Stewart was suspended six games by 
the NCAA for accepting an airplane ticket from a booster. And last year, star 
forward J.R. Rider was charged with academic fraud, a nasty bit of publicity 
that didn't subside until an independent investigation cleared Rider of all 
alleged wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Massimino says the infamous "will-never-embarrass" statement wasn't meant to 
insult Tarkanian, nor was it meant as an absolute guarantee of no future 
athlete-related screw-ups. But the damage, unintentional or otherwise, had been 
done. Allegiances were established. Skirmish lines were drawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it hits you," said Massimino of the UNLV dissension, "no one can 
understand fully the magnitude of the thing." 
</P>
<P>
 This is how petty the feud has become: 
</P>
<P>
 One Rebel fan, a 74-year-old retired dental equipment salesman named Ernie 
Baer, has written letters to UNLV recruits and warned them to play elsewhere. 
He has provided opponents, including USC, with videotape of Rebel games. He has 
sent scouting reports to opposing coaches, including UCLA's Jim Harrick. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't about sabotage or being a hero," Baer told the Las Vegas Sun. 
"This is about the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 The truth of the matter is that Weaver and Massimino would like to insert 
Baer's head into a VCR and press rewind. But they can't, so Weaver, a former 
football coach and recruiter, frets about the potential damage Baer could do. 
Massimino bites his lip and tries to put on a happy face. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a very sensitive person and it's been very difficult for me," Massimino 
said. "But I got up early one morning, as I always do, and said, 'That's it. 
We're going to get this thing done. We're going to do what we've got to do.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I was fed up. I was just fed up. I'd had enough. And I've taken the high 
road, I really have. Criticize me, but just keep the kids out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Easier said than done. No UNLV player can help but notice the darkened luxury 
suites and empty seats at the Thomas & Mack, capacity 18,500. At last Thursday 
evening's game against San Jose State, only 5,053 fans showed up. The town's 
minor league hockey team, of which Tarkanian is retained as "director of 
community relations," draws bigger crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 During the glory seasons of Tarkanian's 19-year reign, Rebel tickets were 
prized possessions. One former Big West opposing coach tells tales of trading 
his personal allotment of UNLV tickets for rooms at casino hotels, dinners at 
the ritzy restaurants, seats at the best shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays? Maybe a Happy Meal out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if Maxson is gone, things will straighten out in a hurry," Tarkanian 
said. "There's too much bitterness. People won't support the university. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's really been unfortunate for Rollie. He's a good coach, he's a 
proven coach. But he's caught in the middle of a buzz saw. The community 
absolutely despises that man (Maxson) more than anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Tarkanian, who said he won't return to a Las Vegas game until Maxson leaves, 
hasn't exactly aided the healing process. He does a twice-a-week radio show on 
one of the local AM stations, and it isn't long before the program becomes an 
anti-Maxson manifesto. 
</P>
<P>
 If he wanted, Tarkanian could call off the dogs and Massimino's program would 
be forever grateful. But that would mean letting Maxson go free and on this 
point, Tarkanian and his supporters refuse to be swayed. 
</P>
<P>
 So Tarkanian does what he can. He deflects all criticism of Massimino, but 
continues to deliver verbal body blows to Maxson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I defend Rollie all the time," Tarkanian said. "I like Rollie." 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday night, less than an hour before tipoff, Tarkanian took his first 
call of the night. It was Bob, from who knows where. Bob, leader of the 
Citizens for the Removal of Robert Maxson, was calling to announce to the 
listeners that he held in his hand a city-approved parade permit to celebrate 
the departure (whenever that might be) of the UNLV president. Bob wanted 
Tarkanian to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm in town, I would definitely be there," Tarkanian assured Bob. "I think 
it's a tremendous idea." 
</P>
<P>
 And so it went, caller after caller sticking pins in a make-believe Maxson 
doll. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, at the Thomas & Mack, the glitzy pregame fireworks and light show 
seemed out of place. So sparse was the audience that the "crowd meter" barely 
broke a sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, UNLV lineup introductions were a treat. The players received polite 
applause, but Massimino wasn't so lucky. The moment his name was announced, the 
boos rained down from the stands. The UNLV pep band leaped into action, but by 
then it didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rebels didn't break into double figures until 8:40 remained in the first 
half. It took them until 4:43 to reach the 20-point mark. By then, members of 
UNLV's own pep band were taking shots at Massimino. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only a game, Rollie!" yelled one band member. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, Rollie, put me in!" yelled another. 
</P>
<P>
 Massimino, his knee resting on a white towel to keep his suit pants clean, 
stared straight ahead. If he had heard the jeers, he didn't acknowledge them. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, when his team had committed 18 turnovers, made three of 17 
three-pointers and lost by six points, Massimino congratulated San Jose State 
and offered no excuses for the Rebels' uninspired play. He didn't say it, but 
his son, Tom, an assistant coach on the staff, does: Beating Georgetown in the 
1985 Final Four championship wasn't this tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "There you knew what you were up against," said the younger Massimino, whose 
father was his best man at his wedding. "Here you don't know what you're up 
against sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 The battles have taken their toll on Rollie Massimino. His friends have 
noticed. Dave Gavitt, senior executive vice president of the Boston Celtics and 
a buddy from their days together in the Big East Conference, made a special 
trip to a recent Long Beach State game just so he could give Massimino a hug. 
Alabama Birmingham Coach Gene Bartow has called. So has Cleveland Cavalier 
Coach Mike Fratello. So has former Marquette Coach Al McGuire. So have former 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Maxson, who might have his choice of jobs at Long Beach or Oklahoma, said 
the pressures on Massimino to succeed are enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worry more about him, I worry more about the players," said Maxson, who sat 
four rows up from midcourt last Thursday night. "They aren't getting the total 
support that they should have." 
</P>
<P>
 As for solutions, Maxson said he won't accept another offer just to appease 
Tarkanian's legions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time is probably the best healer of all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Massimino has lots of that. His contract runs until the turn of the century 
and he said he isn't leaving until the program is returned to its rightful 
place near or atop the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be great," he said, perhaps for his own benefit than anyone 
else's. "We just need a chance."

AFTER SPRINTING START, UCLA IS BEING CAUGHT IN THE STRETCH; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: 
WITH GAMES AGAINST LOUISVILLE TODAY AND OREGON AND OREGON STATE THIS WEEK, 
BRUINS HAVE LITTLE TIME TO TURN IT AROUND BEFORE TOURNAMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Is it too soon to panic at UCLA? 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, panic attacks are never really out of season at Westwood, where 
Bruin followers must come to grips with a newly diagnosed condition affecting 
their basketball team as it walks onto the court at Pauley Pavilion for the 
final time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, UCLA is hurting from something. Call it a reality gap. Are the Bruins the 
14-0 team that started the season or the one that has gone 5-5 since? 
</P>
<P>
 It must be a pretty good question because even the coach doesn't have an 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one knows what kind of team we have," Jim Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not entirely true. Right now, he's got a .500 team, at least for the 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 USC Coach George Raveling said teams are catching on to the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's anything wrong with them morale-wise. It's late in the 
season, teams adjust and this league has good coaches," Raveling said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teams are going to adjust to the things the first time you beat them. The 
second time around, it's a lot harder to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Three times in UCLA's last four games, it has been impossible. The Bruins took 
their first trip through the conference at 8-1, but are 4-3 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 When USC knocked off UCLA, 85-79, Thursday night at the Sports Arena, it 
wasn't exactly great news, not with Louisville (24-4) bringing its run-and-dunk 
act into Pauley Pavilion today and the start of the NCAA tournament less than 
two weeks off. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins aren't exactly catapulting themselves into the tournament. What 
they have done is all but guarantee that they will be shipped out of the West 
region as the result of a second- or third-place finish in the Pacific 10. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA is 19-5, 12-4 in the Pac-10, but could still finish 22-5 and 14-4 by 
sweeping Louisville, then Oregon State and Oregon this week in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe UCLA will snap out of it, but it's going to have to start this afternoon 
against Denny Crum's Cardinals, ranked No. 10 and anointed by some as a 
potential national champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Crum noted that four of UCLA's defeats have been on the road -- at California, 
at Notre Dame, at Arizona and at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you what, that's not too surprising because anybody can beat you in 
a road game today," Crum said. "So I don't know what that makes them. I know 
they're a good team -- excellent athletes, play hard -- and I know we've never 
beaten them in Pauley Pavilion." 
</P>
<P>
 It remains to be seen if this is good or bad news for UCLA. The way things 
have been going, it's hard to tell. Is Louisville due or do the Bruins simply 
have the Cardinals' number? 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's number has been had more than a few times lately. 
</P>
<P>
 The common denominator in Bruin defeats has been poor shooting, including 41% 
against USC, which translates into poor offensive execution. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no secret opponents try to make UCLA play a slower-paced half-court game 
that not only takes away the Bruins' strongest asset, but also exposes one of 
their biggest problems: lack of outside shooting. Only Stanford has made fewer 
three-point shots in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Add that the offense calls for few screens to free Ed O'Bannon, who has to get 
open on his own; that Shon Tarver has either been injured or disappointing; 
that Charles O'Bannon has semi-disappeared in the half-court set; that Kevin 
Dempsey has been a bust as a reserve; that Rodney Zimmerman has been injured 
and that UCLA's inner defense has suffered, then it's not hard to figure out 
what has gone wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 But plenty has gone right, too. George Zidek has been a pleasant, if 
slow-moving, surprise; Cameron Dollar is a real find; Tyus Edney prevents a 
press by his mere presence and Ed O'Bannon is one of the top frontcourt players 
in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick continues to have his share of critics, but he might always have them. 
He probably could win an NCAA title and UCLA people would say he was still nine 
short. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Harrick has shown greater flexibility in player rotation, 
substituting by situation instead of by the clock as in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happens, it's possible that there are Bruin basketball fans who are 
impossible to please, anyway. Crum said it is easy to recognize them. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the people who are not real realistic," he said. "My guess is that 
there are 15 or 20 teams that can win (the NCAA title) because the balance is 
so good. But some (UCLA) fans think they should always win. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well North Carolina has eight McDonald's All-Americans and they've lost six 
games. Do you think North Carolina fans are happy they've lost six games? No, 
but they aren't after Dean Smith. Why? Because they're more realistic. People 
at UCLA are spoiled. They think they are supposed to win it every year." 
</P>
<P>
 If so, they've been supremely disappointed since John Wooden won his last one 
19 years ago.BASKETBALL TEAM

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; NO MICHAEL, MAGIC OR BIRD, SO IT MUST BE THE SHOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Things are tough when we have to surrender the rights to our meal ticket to 
the baseball columnist, but Michael Jordan has retired/changed uniforms and 
life continues, more or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it has gone. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The NBA is hanging in there.  
</P>
<P>
 With Jordan, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird gone, the league was supposed to 
have come on hard times. The season has been no artistic coup, but TV ratings 
haven't dropped. But they haven't risen, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Professional basketball remains a rising star, institutionally supported 
against a return to the bush-league days. 
</P>
<P>
 Sneaker companies still spend millions to promote basketball players above all 
other athletes. For the Super Bowl -- a football game, after all -- five of the 
seven athletes starring in commercials were NBA players. 
</P>
<P>
 In this year's "Q" ratings, an independent marketing survey that advertisers 
use to determine "likability," NBA players finished Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 
9. Respectively, they were Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal, Scottie Pippen, Charles 
Barkley, Johnson, Phil Jackson and Julius Erving. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball's Barry Bonds, by comparison, didn't make the top 100. 
</P>
<P>
 NBA teams make almost twice as much from their TV network contracts as 
baseball teams. In the mid-1980s, baseball teams made almost twice as much as 
NBA teams. 
</P>
<P>
 -- This season stinks.  
</P>
<P>
 There are 10 teams on a 50-loss pace. 
</P>
<P>
 The playoff races are all but over. In the East, No. 8 New Jersey led No. 9 
Charlotte by six games going into the weekend. In the West, No. 8 Denver was 5 
1/2 games ahead of the No. 9 Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No one's scoring any points, either.  
</P>
<P>
 The average NBA team is down five points from last season, from 105 to 100. 
Seven seasons ago, the average was 110. 
</P>
<P>
 "Expansion" and "dilution of talent" are usually blamed for any deterioration, 
but that's a reach five seasons after the last one. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun Coach Paul Westphal has better suspects: the zone defense rules enacted in 
the early '80s to keep the lane open for drivers, and the new breed of 
control-mad, defense-oriented coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The zone rules make it easy to get the ball to a post player since teams can't 
double-team a man who doesn't have the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, everything becomes mechanical -- and takes time: Feed the post, 
the defense double-teams, kick it out, the defense rotates, swing the ball 
before the defense rotates again. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the slowdown looks like a trend, not a fad. The short-term tendency is 
to copy the champion, but the Bulls are decidedly up-tempo and hard to copy -- 
ask the Mavericks' Quinn Buckner. This goes deeper and needs to be addressed. 
Suggestion: Shorten the three-point shot by six inches and let teams play any 
kind of defense they want. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The three-time defending champions are staggering.  
</P>
<P>
 Big surprise, huh? The Bulls were like Wile E. Coyote chasing the Roadrunner 
off a cliff, staying up until he looked down. Reality, that killjoy, caught up 
with the Bulls after they hit the All-Star break with a 34-13 record and the 
easiest remaining schedule of the Eastern contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Since, they are 2-6 at home and losing it in general. Pippen lashed out at 
Bull management and Bull fans. For variety, Jackson blamed 76er management and 
Bull fans (see below). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pippen shouldn't be allowed out by himself.  
</P>
<P>
 Is there anyone Pippen didn't rip last week? "On principle" he protested 
re-signing Toni Kukoc, whose contract has a one-year out. Pippen said he 
deserved to be the highest-paid Bull, adding it was OK for Horace Grant to get 
all he could. Apparently the "principle" was keeping money from Kukoc. 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen ripped Barkley, who had been sneering at the Bulls' success story -- as 
events showed, with reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Pippen: "He only gives superstars like Michael, Magic, Isiah (Thomas) and 
Larry credit and respect. It's all a front. . . . He walks around thinking he's 
the ambassador of the league, but he's a phony person. Until he gets a ring, 
he's not the ambassador of the league. Until Phoenix wins a championship, I'm 
considering myself the ambassador."  
</P>
<P>
 He made an obscene gesture to booing Bull fans, claimed they had never gotten 
on a white player and nominated -- surprise -- Kukoc, who, he noted, had been 
"0 for whatever." 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen sort of recanted the next day in the non-apology of the season: "I 
pretty much apologize to some extent. I feel bad for saying it, but you can't 
really take back things you said. But to some extent, I want to take back what 
I said." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jackson is showing the strain, too.  
</P>
<P>
 Stunned by getting beaten by the Jazz to Jeff Hornacek, he criticized 76er 
owner Harold Katz -- "I don't know the mind-set of Mr. Katz" -- for cutting off 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls' offer? Unrestricted free agent-to-be Scott Williams. They wouldn't 
throw in a No. 1 pick, Utah did and Katz made the deal without giving the Bulls 
a chance to match. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did Jackson like the booing. 
</P>
<P>
 "As many thrills and great games as we've given these fans," he said, "that 
they should boo us . . . . They have absolutely no loyalty to this team. 
There's no excuse for that." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ambassador Barkley isn't doing so hot, himself.  
</P>
<P>
 The last great player from the '80s returned at the All-Star break but largely 
confined himself to standing offshore and lobbing in shells. Of his first 97 
shots, 20 were three-point attempts, of which he made five. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his return, Barkley has averaged 20 points and seven rebounds. Before he 
left, he was 24 and 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns are 5-6 after the break and dropped to No. 5 in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley might simply be out of shape, but he might be saving himself too. He 
keeps saying last year's 62 victories taught the Suns the regular season means 
nothing. For whatever reason, the Suns have never played with last season's 
verve. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not hungry," Kevin Johnson said. "We don't want it. We expect teams to 
lay down. It's a lack of effort, it's very disturbing, and at some point it's 
really going to get us." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pat Riley still has a trick or two up his sleeve.  
</P>
<P>
 With Jordan gone, the league could use an entertaining team in New York. 
Instead, the Knicks have been dull as dishwater, and disappointments, besides. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say defense wins championships," Barkley said after watching the Knicks 
shoot worse than 40% for the third time in four games. "There's not any defense 
in the world that can win with an offense like that." Whipsawed by his last 
four opponents, despairing of ever seeing one of his players except his 
seven-foot center make a jumper, Riley ordered the charter to take a right turn 
near Sacramento and landed in Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't tell his players, who found out on the runway. Limos whisked them to 
the casinos where, of course, the losing streak continued. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in New York, everyone was wondering where they had gone. "SKIDDING KNICKS 
GO INTO HIDING," a Post headline said, "RILEY SMUGGLES TEAM TO RENO." 
</P>
<P>
 The next night, Riley demoted three starters and beat the Kings. As the 
Sundance Kid said, "Keep thinking, Butch, it's what you do best." 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, it might not be a banner season, but it's still NBA basketball. 
It's inimitable -- er, fantastic. FACES AND FIGURES 
</P>
<P>
 Don't call us, we'll call you: NBC passed up last Sunday's Laker-Celtic game. 
TNT had Friday's rematch in Boston on the schedule, but canceled. . . . Can you 
believe the Timberwolves pulled out of that Ed Pinckney-Mike Brown swap with 
Boston? By what stretch of anyone's imagination would that deal make any 
difference, one way or the other? . . . Pinckney, informed it was in the works, 
said: "For whom? Damn. They wanted me out of town that bad?" . . . No one to 
fool with: Referee Steve Javie, who once ejected the Bullets' mascot, tossed 
Portland radio announcer Mike Rice for throwing his arms up at a call. Mused 
Trail Blazer Coach Rick Adelman, whose team is often accused of crying: "No one 
can say it's us now. It's the Portland media." . . . Then there was the night 
Javie ejected then-Piston coach Chuck Daly, assistant Dick Versace and center 
Bill Laimbeer and called a technical on the other assistant, Ron Rothstein. In 
Detroit, it's remembered as the game trainer Mike Abdenour was one "T" away 
from taking over. . . . Paul Westphal, on Pippen's blast at Barkley: "We've 
already played our two games against Chicago this season and we're not supposed 
to play them again in the playoffs. Scottie must have figured out that Charles 
will retire and Scottie won't ever (again) have to face him on the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Hold that dynasty (continued): Larry Johnson and Alonzo Mourning are finally 
set to return, but too late. Assuming 42-40 makes the playoffs, the Hornets 
have to finish 19-10, and it might take more. The Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8 teams are 
the East's hottest. Going into the weekend, the Cavaliers were 27-10 after a 
7-14 start, the Pacers had won 14 of 16, the Nets were 23-15 after a 6-13 start 
and the Heat had won 15 of 20. . . . Then there's the Hornet search for a 
forward. They were talking Danny Manning, thinking about Horace Grant, could 
have gone after Buck Williams, but might have to settle for Frank Brickowski. 
"If (Manning) had been traded to Phoenix or Orlando, that would have pretty 
much closed the door on us," personnel director Dave Twardzik said. "I don't 
think that's the case with Atlanta." 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Schayes, asked how he was shortly before being traded from Milwaukee to 
the Lakers: "I don't get to play, the team stinks, my wife is in Denver and 
it's been 20 below most of the winter." . . . The Cubs, bristling at being 
ignored in Chicago while Jordan tries out with the White Sox, asked WGN if Bozo 
the Clown, star of a children's show, could try out. WGN said no.

 Crenshaw High, The Times' No. 2-rated team, might not have played its best 
game of the season, but the Cougars still had enough to win their second 
consecutive City 4-A Division boys' basketball championship with a 72-53 
victory over Dorsey late Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Before an estimated crowd of 6,500 at the Sports Arena, Crenshaw Coach Willie 
West won his record-setting 13th City title.The Cougars, who have won five 
State titles, also defeated Dorsey in last year's championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw (25-2), which averaged 100.6 points a game this season, was led by 
California-bound forward Tremaine Fowlkes, who had 18 points, 16 rebounds and 
five blocked shots.

 Crenshaw advances into the State Southern Regional tournament at the Anaheim 
Arena next Saturday. LONNIE WHITE

 Belmont High upset top-seeded Bell, 1-0, in the boys' City Section soccer 
final Saturday, and Van Nuys Grant beat San Pedro by the same score to become 
the second team to win the girls' championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Ana Hufanga of Grant and Jose Salmeron of Belmont had second-half goals to 
provide all the scoring for the 300 spectators who watched the doubleheader at 
Birmingham High in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Hufanga's goal came four minutes into the second half after Nicole Bucciarelli 
drove the ball to the top of the San Pedro goal box and passed it to Hufanga. 
Hufanga made a fake and blasted it home for the Lancers' first championship in 
three appearances. They finished 12-3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmeron, a striker, scored his 14th goal of the season at the 60-minute mark 
after receiving a throw-in pass from Nelson Moran. Salmeron's goal was only the 
10th given up by the Eagles all season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way we started the season, we would have never believed we were going to 
be here," said Belmont Coach Nancy Carr-Swaim, who guided the Sentinels 
(10-1-2) to the 1992 final, but lost to Garfield, 2-1. "This is the most 
well-rounded team that I've ever coached." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles outshot the Sentinels, 12-8, forcing Belmont goalies Octavio 
Calvillo and Mario Orellana to make three key saves each.

STATE WRESTLING CHAMPIONSHIPS; CALVARY CHAPEL IS AN UNPOPULAR WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Ana Calvary Chapel flexed its way to a second consecutive state 
wrestling title Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel dominated the two-day meet to the point that the Eagles had the 
championship wrapped up before the final round began, and the sold-out crowd at 
the University of Pacific's Spanos Center felt the little Christian school was 
getting greedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel sent eight wrestlers to the state tournament and three to the 
finals, where they all won their weight classes. The Eagles finished with a 
state-record 120.5 points. Runner-up Moreno Valley Canyon Springs produced 81.5 
points and two champions -- brothers Norman Abs (103 pounds) and Stephen Abs 
(112). 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel had a hard time winning the fans' hearts. After defending state 
champion Dane Valdez -- the heavy favorite to add the 125-pound ribbon to last 
year's 119 -- was upset in the morning semifinals, fans roared their approval. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't get nicer when brother Shane Valdez won the 119 title and was booed 
for his defensive stance. 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Holiday (145) and Ed Mosley (152) also won titles for Calvary Chapel.

KORDA LOOKS TO REPEAT AGAINST SAMPRAS; TENNIS: HE DEFEATED THE NO. 1 PLAYER IN 
DECEMBER IN MUNICH AND WILL GET ANOTHER CHANCE TODAY AFTER BEATING KRICKSTEIN, 
6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This isn't Munich. The court isn't indoors and Pete Sampras doesn't have 
stomach cramps. 
</P>
<P>
 But Petr Korda learned in Germany what Stefan Edberg couldn't figure out here 
Saturday at the Newsweek Champions Cup at Hyatt Grand Champions. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a way to beat the current No. 1 player in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Go five sets. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Take 4 hours 31 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Win, 13-11, in the fifth set. 
</P>
<P>
 Korda managed that last December in the semifinals of the $6-million Grand 
Slam Cup in Munich, defeating Sampras, 3-6, 7-6 (7-3), 3-6, 7-6 (12-10), 13-11. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of the best matches I ever played, especially (because) I showed 
to the world how good a fighter I am," Korda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Korda, 26, didn't need to be a fighter Saturday at Indian Wells, breezing past 
Aaron Krickstein, 6-4, 6-4, to reach the final today against Sampras.  
</P>
<P>
 Sampras advanced with a 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 victory over Edberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Korda's serve was working Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not often that I lose a match where I never break serve," said 
Krickstein, who is expected to move up 10 places in the rankings to No. 28 
after victories this week over No. 5 Sergi Bruguera and No. 18 Alexander 
Volkov. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge is merely beginning for No. 14 Korda, who beat No. 9 Todd Martin 
in the second round but benefited from the upsets of No. 3 Jim Courier and No. 
8 Michael Chang.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think if Korda serves as well as he did today, he can definitely stay with 
him and possibly win," Krickstein said. "But I'd be surprised if he serves 
tomorrow as well as he did today." 
</P>
<P>
 Korda acknowledges that he has made some changes in his serve, but he isn't 
giving any specifics. He has surprised people before -- not the least of whom 
are Stefan Edberg, Sampras and Michael Stich. 
</P>
<P>
 Consecutively, all three of those players -- all in five sets -- fell to Korda 
in his tour de force at Munich. Edberg lost to Korda in the quarterfinals, 2-6, 
3-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-1. Stich finally dropped in the final, 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5), 
2-6, 11-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Memorable? Maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 But fun? 169 games? 
</P>
<P>
 Korda made it look that way against Sampras. Leg cramps took their toll on the 
Czech player, but he tried to make light of them, playing to the crowd by 
hopping across the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Stomach cramps weren't so easy for Sampras to downplay. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end, we didn't look so good on the court, but, for me, most important, 
I won the important last points," Korda said. 
</P>
<P>
 The surface is important, too, and if the Indian Wells court does not have the 
speed of Munich, it is "quite fast," according to Korda. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Czech player isn't ignoring the contrast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here it is a little different because the balls are very light. If he's going 
to serve well, it's going to be difficult," Korda said. "But, at the moment I'm 
playing well, and, like I said, I'm going to really enjoy tennis tomorrow, and 
I have nothing to lose. He has to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Korda: "I think I'm playing a little better tennis than I was two years 
ago because I'm serving much better than before and I'm getting more free 
points than I used to get. I'm trying to play more serve and volley." Tennis 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 ATP Tour statistics do not recognize Petr Korda's victory over Pete Sampras, 
because the Grand Slam Cup is not sanctioned by the tour. It is part of the 
political division in tennis. When the players put together their own tour, the 
International Tennis Federation decided to put on its own tournament and draws 
a field of 16 of the top players in the world for the event.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; DREIFORT IS CALMLY EFFECTIVE IN VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Rookie Darren Dreifort said he wasn't nervous when he took the mound in his 
first major league game, against the Florida Marlins at Melbourne, Fla., on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just another day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort pitched two hitless innings in the Dodgers' 6-5 victory. He entered 
the game in the fourth inning, gave up back-to-back walks with one out and got 
out of the jam on a double play. In the fifth, he retired the side in order and 
got the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still early, but you have to be impressed with what he is throwing," 
catcher Mike Piazza said. "His most effective pitch is going to be his sinker. 
You think you are going to tee it off and it sinks about six inches. Guys come 
up to the plate thinking they are going to intimidate him, and it's the 
opposite." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Martinez, who was late in reporting to spring training while working on 
a new windup in the Dominican Republic, faltered in his first spring start 
against the Marlins. Pitching with a 3-0 lead, Martinez gave up four runs, 
three walks and four hits, including a home run by Nigel Wilson, in three 
innings. He left the game with the score tied. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez now brings his hands over and behind his head in his windup. "With my 
new windup, I am not going to be wild like I was last year, but I will work on 
it throughout the spring and be ready to go by the season," Martinez said. "It 
will be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 After going 37-19 during his first two full seasons, Martinez has since fallen 
to 18-23. Since the All-Star break in 1991, Martinez is 23-33 with an 
earned-run average of more than 4.00. He has lost speed off his fastball, and 
he still has not developed a good curveball. "I gave up on my curveball -- I 
kept working on it and was getting no results," he said. "Now I have more of a 
slider that I worked on this winter. So that's one of the reasons I wanted to 
stay, to work on these things (in a game situation)." MARYANN HUDSON

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; THIS SEASON, FINLEY WANTS TO STAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By BOB NIGHTENGALE

<TEXT>
<P>
 It will happen sometime this month. He will hear his name on TV. Read it in 
the newspapers. Listen to it being bandied about in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel starter Chuck Finley is bracing himself for the inevitable trade rumors, 
now that teammate Mark Langston has a three-year, $14-million contract 
extension. Finley instantly becomes the prized left-handed commodity that most 
contenders will attempt to lure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'm kind of the cricket on top of the water now," said Finley, who 
yielded three runs in the Angels' 10-7 loss to the Chicago Cubs at Mesa, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels talked about trading Finley to the Houston Astros during the 
winter, and the Toronto Blue Jays remain interested, but there's a huge 
difference this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley doesn't want to go anywhere, and the Angels are reluctant to trade him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty frustrated at the end of last season," said Finley, who finished 
16-14 with a 3.15 ERA. "I thought we played a little over our heads the first 
half, but we were just going through the motions toward the end. Those things 
tend to carry over and linger. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now, I really want to stay. I know one day will come when they'll want to 
sever the cord, but it would be nice to finish my career here. I want to win, 
and I think after what this organization has just done, there's no reason we 
can't win right here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angel outfielder Dwight Smith got off the team bus Saturday morning and 
immediately saw the sign hanging behind the left-field fence: Dwight Smith 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
 They remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who played 10 years in the Chicago Cub organization before leaving in 
December, received a rousing welcome from his former teammates and fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "You guys better win it all this year," Smith said, "and when you need someone 
for that pennant stretch, come and get me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't get me wrong, I'm going to bust my butt for the Angels, but I'll always 
love the Cubs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs, who did not tender him a contract to avoid arbitration, have told 
the Angels that they are interested in trading for Smith, but the Angels have 
rejected their advances. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Smith harbored no grudge toward his former teammates, Cub reliever Chuck 
Crim didn't share those same sentiments toward the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Crim remains bitter that the Angels released him May 31, 1993, and his only 
regret Saturday was that he was unable to pitch against them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm dying to pitch against them," Crim said, "and believe me, that's going to 
be a great motivator. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Angels said I couldn't pitch, but all I know is that they were in first 
place by two games when I left, and they ended up 71-91. You don't think I 
enjoyed that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Crim, who was 2-2 with a 5.87 ERA in 11 games with the Angels, received 
several offers to pitch after being released. But he decided it was time to 
rehabilitate his aching right shoulder, and spent the summer strengthening it. 
He received a tryout with the Cubs in December, and signed as a non-roster 
player in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys are giving me the benefit of the doubt," Crim said, "something the 
Angels wouldn't do." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Hilly Hathaway did little to enhance his chances of making the pitching staff 
by yielding two two-run homers in two innings. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hathaway, who last swung a bat five years ago at Bradenton, Fla., Junior 
College, stunned his teammates by hitting a run-scoring single up the middle in 
the fourth inning. He later scored. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been kind of bragging to everyone that he can hit," Finley said, "but 
that was amazing. It was very uplifting to see an American League pitcher get a 
hit, an RBI and a run scored. We were waiting for him to steal." BOB

 Surgery is planned Tuesday for 2-year-old champion Dehere, who suffered a 
broken right hind leg in a workout Friday and won't run in any of the Triple 
Crown races. 
</P>
<P>
 Dehere is "receiving medication and is resting as well as can be expected," 
trainer Reynaldo Nobles said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dehere was injured at Palm Beach Downs, a training center where the colt is 
wintering. Surgery is scheduled at a clinic in nearby Pompano Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want him to have to travel too far and risk further damage," Nobles 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dehere was the early favorite for the Florida Derby on March 12. He beat 
favored and previously unbeaten Holy Bull and highly regarded Go For Gin in the 
$200,000 Fountain of Youth on Feb. 19.

THE NEWEST THING IN THE SHOE BUSINESS IS BASED ON A CENTURIES-OLD DESIGN, AND 
MANUFACTURERS ARE STEPPING UP THEIR EFFORTS TO GET A FOOTHOLD IN THE MARKET FOR 
...; THE SHOE OF THE FUTURE; FOOTWEAR: THE SANDALS CRAZE HAS PROMPTED COMPANIES 
TO DEVELOP DESIGNS FIT FOR EVERYTHING FROM CANOEING AND SAILING TO HIKING OR 
SIMPLY KNOCKING ABOUT.

 It's midwinter, and another layer of snow has just fallen on frigid Buffalo, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ron Pecci, a Franciscan priest, is wearing sandals as he navigates the 
snowdrifts that ring Sts. Rita and Patrick Church. "With socks, sandals are 
warm enough to wear year-round," Pecci said. "Unless it's really cold rain, it 
doesn't matter. And I wear them in the winter as long as the snow is clean." 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers are rapidly discovering what the Franciscans have known for ages: 
Sandals can be four-season footwear, sturdy enough to go long distances over 
any terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the biggest names in footwear are scrambling to capitalize on that 
epiphany. At least 20 manufacturers are now selling sport sandals, tough 
footwear that travels boldly where flimsy flip-flops would never dare to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Footwear manufacturers are pitching sandals as appropriate gear for everything 
from canoeing and sailing to hiking, jogging or simply knocking about. Annual 
U.S. sales of sport sandals, now about $125 million, are expected to hit $400 
million in a few years, industry analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sandals strolled into the fashion spotlight just as America's longstanding 
love affair with athletic shoes was fading. Sales of regular athletic footwear 
declined by 2.4% in 1992, in large part because consumers were switching to 
shoes that are more at home outdoors than in the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some market changes had to occur because people were looking for something 
new," said Nancy Larsen, spokeswoman for shoemaker Asics Tiger Corp. The 
company, based in Fountain Valley, sold 60,000 pairs of sport sandals in 1993, 
a 300% increase from 1992, when it entered the category. 
</P>
<P>
 "The outdoorsy look and the sandals craze are a natural progression as people 
look for something more to wear," Larsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nike, Asics and Adidas are counting on the fast-growing outdoors market -- 
which includes sandals -- to balance the sales slowdown in their main shoe 
lines. But they are facing stiff competition from Timberland and other 
entrenched makers of outdoor footwear. 
</P>
<P>
 As manufacturers rush to meet changing consumer demands, the lines that 
separate footwear categories are blurring. 
</P>
<P>
 Asics, for example, has developed a high-performance tennis shoe that looks 
like a hiking boot. Shoe manufacturers also are readying "some interesting 
designs that mark the start of an interesting bridge between sandals and 
athletic shoes," Larsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 As established manufacturers and upstarts jockey for position, "everyone will 
come out with every kind of iteration on a shoe and sandal that anyone could 
conceive of," said Gary Jacobson, an analyst with the brokerage Kidder Peabody 
& Co. in New York. "This is just the start." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the nation's leading sport sandal company is already sticking its toes 
into the shoe market. Deckers Outdoor Corp. in Carpinteria, which distributes 
the popular Teva line of sandals, will introduce this fall three new models 
that will further blur the distinction: SandalHiker, SandalShoe and SandalBoot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nike, Timberland and Rockport have been in the sandal business for (at least) 
three years, and we're still beating them in the marketplace," said Peter Link, 
Deckers vice president. "We're feeling pretty confident in our back yard, and 
now we're going after their back yard a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite strong competition, Deckers has kept its dominance of the sandals 
market. The company reported 1993 revenue of $50 million, up from just $5.9 
million in 1990. It also made its first public stock offering last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Deckers' growth is driven by sales of the Teva line of sandals, which Grand 
Canyon river guide Mark Thatcher designed to solve a pressing personal problem: 
what to wear on your feet while white-water rafting. Deckers acquired the right 
to manufacture Teva products in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 The company controls about half of the sport sandals market but is keeping a 
wary eye on Nike. "Everybody has to pay attention to Nike because of their 
strength, size and power," Deckers President Doug Otto said in a recent 
interview with Footwear Plus, a trade magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Deckers is wary -- but not afraid -- of the bigger guys. "Our business is 
better than ever, in part because these guys have legitimized the category," 
Link said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nike bears watching, though. It did not introduce its first sport sandal until 
late 1992 and has already logged $50 million in sales. "The sandals market is 
booming for us," said Keith Peters, a spokesman at the company's Beaverton, 
Ore., headquarters. "Our Air Deshutz is the single largest selling model, and 
we hope to overtake (market leader) Teva next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Action Sports Retailer, a trade magazine, also reports that Nike received more 
early orders for its Air Deshutz sandal than any of its better-established 
lines -- a dramatic development at a company whose very name is synonymous with 
athletic shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 An executive at another shoe company said Nike's 1993 sandals advertising 
budget exceeded its revenue from sandals. "That's a real good indication of how 
important they think sandals are," the executive said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers also are honing marketing campaigns to help persuade consumers 
to strap on their products. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Teva's tough-sounding Terradactyls. The sandals, which retail for 
$69.95, feature an "all-terrain dino-grip foot bed, a unique Shoc Pad . . . and 
grooved traction sole for running and hiking." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego-based Flojos describes its Agave 4x4 model as an "all-terrain sandal 
that's the most athletically correct sandal available." Marketing director Jim 
Watson said Flojos "even had marathon runners test them." 
</P>
<P>
 Several footwear manufacturers have also introduced tough waterproof models 
that do double duty as boat shoes, giving sailors gripping power combined with 
the comfort of sandals. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion, rather than function, explains some of the sandal boom, though. 
Designers in New York and Europe are incorporating a wide array of sandals -- 
many to be worn with socks -- in their 1994 lines. College students and the 
coffeehouse set are also wearing sandals, even in cold climates such as 
Buffalo's. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're even selling them to kids who'd been wearing Doc Martens," Watson said. 
"We give them a heavy look with lug soles and a nice European-looking upper." 
</P>
<P>
 Gayle Rettig, who sells Birkenstocks and other sandals at stores in Dana Point 
and San Juan Capistrano, said sales are being driven by "a generation now in 
its 30s that was raised in tennis shoes . . . and who find it very difficult to 
put on a dress shoe that cramps their feet." 
</P>
<P>
 "Feet are the foundation for your whole body, and once you've had comfortable 
shoes on, your body rebels if you put on something that doesn't feel right," 
Rettig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Margot Fraser, who has marketed German-made Birkenstock footwear for 25 years, 
said: "What's happening to the sandal market is really amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 "Things started to change two or three years ago, and sandals now have much 
more acceptance," said Fraser, president of Novato, Calif.-based Birkenstock 
Footprint Sandals Inc., which reported 1993 sandals sales of $60 million, up 
from $50 million in 1992. "Particularly among men -- they're not afraid anymore 
to show their feet." Trying to Step Up Sales 
</P>
<P>
 Flat revenue has prompted athletic-shoe manufacturers, such as Asics Tiger 
Corp. in Fountain Valley, to add sandals to their product lineup. Here is how 
athletic footwear retail sales fared from 1988 to 1992, the most recent year 
for which figures are available: Pairs purchased (in thousands) 1988: 377,103 
1989: 388,625 1990: 392,977 1991: 381,345 1992: 374,389 
</P>
<P>
 Value of sales (in millions) 1988: $9,737 1989: 10,885 1990: 11,941 1991: 
11,929 1992: 11,639 
</P>
<P>
 It's a Young Guy Thing 
</P>
<P>
 Among teen-agers, males were by far the bigger buyers of athletic shoes in 
1992. In other age groups, females led. The market, by sex: 
</P>
<P>
 Males Under 18: 51% Males 18-34: 27 Males 35-55: 15 Males Older than 55: 7 
</P>
<P>
 Females Under 18: 37% Females 18-34: 30 Females 35-55: 22 Females Older than 
55: 11 
</P>
<P>
 Why They Buy Exercise and sports participation play a minor role in compelling 
consumers to buy athletic shoes. About 80% of 1992 purchases were intended for 
non-sports purposes: Casual wear: 43% Work or school: 34 Sports: 11 Walking for 
exercise: 8 Dress: 1 Other: 3

MEGA-MEDICINE; HOSPITAL MERGER PLANS RAISE THE QUESTION: IS BIGGER BETTER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 If you have to go to the hospital in San Diego, your admission most likely 
will be handled by one of four big health care networks. If you're an 
independent-minded physician who has resisted joining one of these networks, 
you are probably losing patients fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Diego County is becoming a health care oligopoly where a limited number 
of entities are providing the majority of care to the 2.6 million people in 
this community," says Jim Lott, chief executive of the Hospital Council of San 
Diego and Imperial Counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the "managed competition" proposed by President Clinton, experts predict 
that care delivery in much of the nation will come to resemble that in San 
Diego. An estimated 75% of hospital admissions in the county now go through one 
of the area's large, growing and fiercely competitive networks of hospitals, 
clinics and physicians: Scripps-Health, Sharp Health Care, UC San Diego 
Healthcare Network and Kaiser Permanente. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without government reform, the marketplace is driving toward the San 
Diego model all by itself. Much as mergers in the financial services industry 
during the 1980s resulted in fewer and bigger banks, consolidation in medical 
services is doing the same to hospitals, insurers and pharmaceutical companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, physicians and hospitals trying to cope with all this change are 
complaining that federal antitrust laws are getting in the way of their efforts 
to economize. While the complaint is not new, it takes on added urgency in 
today's rapidly evolving climate. Some argue that Clinton's plan -- intended to 
encourage cooperative ventures among health care providers and thus help 
control costs -- doesn't always jibe with the Administration's push for tough 
enforcement of antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Melnick, a consultant with the Rand research firm in Santa Monica, calls 
the Clinton plan "very schizophrenic. Its theme is managed competition, but 
then it talks about cooperation among providers and relaxing antitrust laws." 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital council's Lott puts it this way: "The government is running 
head-on into a philosophical dilemma." 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission -- the federal agencies 
charged with enforcing antitrust laws to protect consumers -- face the daunting 
regulatory task of trying to sort all this out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're being stretched to the limit," says Mark Whitener, acting deputy 
director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition. 
</P>
<P>
 As the pace of industry deal-making heats up, consumer advocates, health 
professionals and others are starting to ask whether all this activity helps or 
hurts consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer isn't black and white. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very important issue," says Linda Lipsen, legislative director for 
Washington-based Consumers Union. "Our sense is that consumers are losing 
clout" with some consolidation moves, while "some of the deals will be good" 
for the public, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, providers' efforts to economize have clashed with antitrust law: 
</P>
<P>
 In Pueblo, Colo., the city's two hospitals wanted to merge. They argued that 
one financially strong hospital could serve the community better than two 
struggling ones, but the FTC opposed the deal, saying it would create a 
monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ukiah, Calif., the FTC and Ukiah Valley Medical Center have waged a 
five-year legal battle over the 1988 consolidation of two hospitals. The 
dispute, still unresolved, has cost the small hospital about $2.5 million in 
attorney and consulting fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Near San Francisco, the FTC accused two East Bay pulmonology groups of 
wielding excessive market power by referring patients to home oxygen suppliers 
they also owned. Last year, the agency proposed a settlement that would limit 
the number of doctors within the region who could participate in the ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Health care industry officials say that by banding together, they can 
eliminate waste and duplication and enhance their services -- goals at the 
heart of the Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics say bigger isn't always better, that the emergence of big 
conglomerates could reduce consumers' choices, drive up prices instead of 
trimming them and diminish the physician's role to the detriment of the 
patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Most agree that consolidation generally is a good thing for the overgrown 
health care business. But too much consolidation -- for example, the merger of 
the only two hospitals in a town -- can be bad for consumers. As doctors, 
hospitals and other providers scramble to preserve their stakes in the system, 
industry observers say, some will form ventures that serve mainly their own 
interests, not the consumers'. 
</P>
<P>
 Rand's Melnick says the industry, particularly in California, has become 
fiercely competitive, and weaker institutions are in a fight for survival. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm a hospital or doctor, all this competition is forcing me to cut costs 
and makes my job harder," he says. "What's my response? One is to improve 
efficiency, but another is to reduce competition. If I can reduce competition, 
then there's not so much pressure on cost." 
</P>
<P>
 The American Medical Assn. has been the strongest advocate of changing 
antitrust law for physician ventures. It contends that doctors are losing much 
of the clout they once wielded. Physicians trying to form their own health 
plans -- or to form large groups of specialists, such as radiologists -- 
sometimes have been rebuffed by antitrust laws that define such arrangements as 
price-fixing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our concern is what's going to happen to the physician-patient relationship 
and the physician's role as a patient advocate when, and if, most health care 
is delivered by large, integrated systems primarily owned and operated by 
insurers and hospitals," says Kirk Johnson, AMA general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital industry has criticized antitrust laws as being confusingly vague 
and inconsistently applied by the FTC and Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the American Hospital Assn. lashed out at federal regulators after 
the FTC said it would block the Pueblo hospital merger. A week earlier, the 
Justice Department gave the all-clear to a merger in another two-hospital town, 
Manchester, N.H. Federal regulators said the two cases, though similar on the 
surface, are quite different, particularly in the size of the markets in which 
the hospitals compete. 
</P>
<P>
 The AHA said the Pueblo ruling was sending "a chilling message to hospitals 
trying to reduce duplication of services and serve their communities more 
efficiently." 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics of the "chilling effect" notion point out that the vast majority of 
health care mergers are allowed to take place. The FTC's decision on Pueblo, 
for example, was only the ninth time since 1987 that the government has 
challenged a hospital merger, while about 150 such mergers were completed in 
that period. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody likes the antitrust laws applied to them; everybody wants to be an 
island of monopoly in a sea of competition." says Anne Bingaman, assistant 
attorney general in the Justice Department's antitrust division. "The whole 
idea of managed competition is that there should be someone else to compete 
with." 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital executives, however, say the small number of antitrust challenges is 
misleading. Many deals are scuttled before they get started, they say, because 
hospitals and their lawyers are worried about running afoul of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at a time where an enormous amount of change needs to be going on," 
says Frederic J. Entin, the AHA's general counsel. "There's an unwillingness by 
hospitals to expose themselves to the expense and delay that an antitrust 
challenge might mean." 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department tried to address industry concerns in September, when 
it identified six "safety zones" for health care ventures, including hospital 
mergers. The agency also pledged to respond in writing within 90 days to 
businesses' requests for antitrust guidance on a proposed deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Since September, the department has received only "eight or nine" requests for 
advice on health care deals, Bingaman says -- far fewer than she expected, 
given the number of industry complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 The clash between medical consolidation and antitrust law is probably most 
pronounced in the hospital category. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pueblo, officials of St. Mary-Corwin Regional Medical Center and Parkview 
Episcopal Medical Center argued that the two not-for-profit hospitals were 
struggling financially and would not survive separately. They said that by 
eliminating duplication of services and staff, they would save at least $50 
million over five years, and reduce medical costs in a community where 30% of 
households have annual incomes of less than $12,500. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pueblo hospitals have problems common to the industry, including declining 
patient volume and competition from outpatient surgery centers. Together they 
have 524 beds, but their average daily occupancy fell from 258 in January, 
1992, to 163 in December, 1993. Both hospitals have pediatric wards but often 
close them for lack of patients. 
</P>
<P>
 By combining, the hospitals contended, they could have improved the quality of 
care. For example, both hospitals offer heart surgery, but each handles only 
about 75 such cases annually. Studies have shown higher success rates at 
hospitals that perform surgeries more frequently, says Sister Sally Duffy, 
chief executive of St. Mary-Corwin Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 She says the FTC challenge, which forced the hospitals to abandon the merger 
plan, "will be costly to this community -- there's no doubt in my mind." The 
hospitals had hoped to expand preventive health programs -- and the community 
has Colorado's highest rates of diabetes and teen-age pregnancy, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Parkview CEO Michael Pugh says the FTC decision showed "a complete lack of 
understanding of health care economics, the way this system really works and 
the reality of how it is changing." 
</P>
<P>
 But the FTC staff concluded that the merger would raise, not lower, prices and 
would not necessarily improve care in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was going to create a monopoly," Whitener says, noting that the nearest 
hospitals outside Pueblo are about 40 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital monopolies aren't a problem in San Diego, but some in the community 
are questioning what consolidation will mean to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Rodney Hood, a primary care physician, is concerned that the networks may 
become large, impersonal institutions that won't meet the needs of low-income 
and minority patients. The networks, he says, need to address "the social, 
financial, racial and cultural barriers that impede access" to care for these 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael R. Stringer, director of hospitals and clinics at UC San Diego, says 
such issues should be debated as the networks mature. In an effort to better 
serve the ethnic market, the UCSD Healthcare Network aligned itself with a 
group of black, Latino and Asian primary care doctors founded by Hood. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such concerns, a Hospital Council survey in 1991 found that 86% of San 
Diego area residents were either "pleased" or "very pleased" with the care they 
were getting, Lott says. 
</P>
<P>
 But he noted that the San Diego market has consolidated rapidly since then. 
</P>
<P>
 One result has been that more employers attracted to the idea of "one-stop 
shopping" are offering workers fewer health plans to choose from, Lott says. If 
employees have only one plan available to them, they may lose the ability to 
see a favorite doctor if he or she isn't with that group. San Diego: 
Foreshadowing Health Care's Future? 
</P>
<P>
 Four big health-care networks -- comprised of physicians, hospitals and 
clinics -- dominate the San Diego market. Together, the groups account for an 
estimated 75% of all hospital admissions in San Diego County. Analysts say 
economics and Washington's plans for health-care reform are forging ever larger 
health care providers in other communities, as well. The potential advantage is 
cost-containment. The risks? Patients and doctors already face fewer choices, 
and limited competition actually could drive prices up.

Hospital Industry Mergers 
</P>
<P>
 Mergers among U.S. hospitals peaked in 1988. But while final figures are not 
yet available, they are thought to have increased substantially last year. 1994 
also is expected to be a busy year for mergers, as hospital operators cast a 
wary eye at the Clinton Administration's health care plans.

JAMES FLANIGAN: AMID SHADOWS, ONE ACQUIRES A FEEL FOR SUBSTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 What are intelligent investors to think as the economy keeps showing strength 
while the stock market gyrates from doubt to confidence and back again? Simple: 
Always choose substance over shadow, the economy over the psychological basket 
case called "the market." Sooner or later, reality wins. 
</P>
<P>
 The economy's strength showed again Friday morning when the Labor Department 
reported that 217,000 jobs were created last month and unemployment fell. But 
the bond market's reaction to that great news was an offense to common sense: 
Interest rates on long-term bonds rose on fears that more Americans working 
would lead to inflation and another hike in short-term interest rates by the 
Federal Reserve Board. Stocks did better, reckoning rightly that if U.S 
business is hiring more workers, it must also be making a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 But smart investors should ignore the whole shadow play. "Don't be spooked by 
the market, think for yourself," says stockbroker Esther Berger, who 
specializes in advising women clients at Paine Webber's office in Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at the realities behind the fears of inflation, at long-term interest 
rates that have gone up too fast and thus may well come back down. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at stocks of individual companies, especially those that have been rising 
through the past uncertain month. 
</P>
<P>
 And think ahead to what the future holds for companies and industries that may 
be out of favor in the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates are behaving strangely. In an unforeseen reaction to the Fed's 
quarter-point boost in short-term rates, to 3.25%, long-term rates have surged. 
The U.S. Treasury's 30-year bond, which influences mortgages and most business 
and consumer borrowing, has risen to 6.83% from 6.3%. That's a very major 
increase, "one of the fastest in 40 years," says John Isaacson, research 
director of Payden & Rygel, a Los Angeles investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Some instability in global bond markets is behind the oddity, plus the fears 
of professional bond investors that economic expansion will mean inflation and 
higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 But inflation fears are misplaced, and long-term interest rates at or near 7% 
are not really sustainable. Business borrowing isn't there, to begin with, 
because U.S. companies after years of trimming fat to increase efficiency are 
generating ample amounts of their own cash. McDonald's, Toys R Us and Coca-Cola 
are buying back huge amounts of their stock, over and above what they invest in 
new projects, because they have so much spare cash. 
</P>
<P>
 This economy is efficient, spare and strong, not bloated. Price increases in 
service industries, which are 75% of the economy, were 2% last year. 
Productivity is rising, meaning U.S. business is getting more bang for the buck 
from every resource. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with all that in mind, investors should make a list of stocks that are 
doing well even as the market drifts -- either for purchase or to see if their 
mutual fund is holding them. Leading that list would be companies that provide 
machinery or services to industry, especially overseas, where competitive U.S. 
business is busy building the industrial infrastructure of the developing 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Illinois companies -- Caterpillar Inc., the Peoria construction equipment 
maker, and Deere & Co., the Moline-based farm machinery producer -- will top 
such a list. Two engineering and construction companies now enjoying worldwide 
demand for their services, Foster Wheeler Corp. and Fluor Corp., will be on the 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 And there will be many others. But the point for investors is not to follow 
any specific list, but to jog their thinking about the real prospects for 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Think, for example, about electric utilities, an industry that has been out of 
favor due to stock market fears of rising interest rates -- which make 
utilities' borrowing more expensive but their dividends less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 As their stock prices have languished, many utility dividend yields have 
become rewarding -- especially if you keep in mind that long-term interest 
rates are likely to settle back down. Financial consultant Laszlo Birinyi 
points to American Electric Power's 7.2% dividend, at the current stock price, 
as attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 Utility analyst Edward Tirello of NatWest Securities recommends a variety of 
companies, including Central & South West, with a 6.3% dividend, and PacifiCorp 
at 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 At their current stock prices, most California utilities pay high dividends, 
including San Diego Gas & Electric at 6.5% and Pacific Gas & Electric at 6.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 And the utility industry is interesting for long-term reasons. The electric 
power business is about to be deregulated, meaning efficient utilities will be 
able to sell power at lower prices to business customers in the territories of 
other utilities. Ohio's state government has already given approval for such 
competition, and other states will follow, says Tirello. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect is for larger or smarter utilities to gain customers, but not 
merely that. Electric companies will gain efficiencies through alliances, or by 
swapping bits of territory with other companies. There will be mergers and 
spinoffs and all the other investment opportunities that come with regulatory 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an added factor, touching on the telecommunications field. Electric 
companies will be upgrading their lines into the home in this decade, to 
accommodate the demands of modern appliances and systems. Yet in all the 
ballyhoo about information highways, there is scant mention of the electric 
companies' potential to carry information or computer data over their power 
lines. But that potential is real and may well emerge competitively in the 
years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 The electric utility industry, in short, will be an exciting business to study 
and invest in -- for people who keep an eye on the substance of the U.S. 
economy rather than the shadows in its financial markets.

LESSONS EMERGE FROM YEARS OF U.S. DICKERING WITH JAPAN; TRADE: THE FIRST IS, 
EXPECT NO VOLUNTARY CONCESSIONS. ANOTHER IS TO IGNORE TOKYO'S COMPETITIVE 
STRENGTH AT YOUR PERIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When President Clinton declared last month that America's $59.3-billion trade 
deficit with Japan was "unsustainable," it was not the first time the Japanese 
had heard such a warning. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, for example, then-President Richard M. Nixon warned that "our 
economic disputes could tear the fabric of our alliance." 
</P>
<P>
 The year before, the deficit had reached $4.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Threats by the Clinton Administration to retaliate with sanctions carry an 
aura of deja vu here, too.  
</P>
<P>
 In the first Japan-must-open-its-markets speech, then-Commerce Secretary John 
T. Connor complained in 1966 of Japan's virtual ban on foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are determined to uphold the principles of equity and reciprocity -- 
positively or negatively -- whichever is called for," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Connor spoke six months after the United States suffered its first trade 
deficit with Japan: $359 million in 1965. Twenty-eight more annual deficits, 
countless rounds of trade negotiations and American cries of "Wolf!" -- made at 
ever higher levels of red ink -- have followed. 
</P>
<P>
 President Ronald Reagan in 1987 did slap 100% tariffs on $300-million worth of 
Japanese imports as a penalty for a single alleged Japanese violation of a 
bilateral agreement on semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, by contrast, is now pondering a totally new path in U.S.-Japan 
economic relations -- one that would impose sanctions to punish the entire 
Japanese market, which he insists is closed. On Thursday, he revived the harsh 
"Super 301" trade provision, which lets the President apply punitive tariffs 
against the goods of unfair trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-eight years of U.S.-Japan trade negotiations show that if Clinton does 
not act, the credibility of American threats will vanish. If he does act, the 
penalties will have to produce billions, not millions, of dollars worth of 
damage to reduce the "unsustainable" trade deficit to a "sustainable" level -- 
and that could precipitate a trade war. 
</P>
<P>
 Foremost among the lessons of those negotiations is: Expect no voluntary 
Japanese concessions, and none at all that will cause pain and injury to 
Japanese industry. 
</P>
<P>
 When Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka finally ended the government ban on 100% 
foreign ownership of companies in Japan in 1973, private industry already had 
set up its own wall against foreign takeovers by establishing an intricate 
system of cross-holding stocks. The system, which continues today, ensures that 
no more than about 30% of any company's stock is ever traded publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 Another lesson of U.S.-Japanese economic relations is: Ignore Japan's 
competitive strength at your peril. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite predictions in the 1960s that Japan was destined to become an economic 
superpower, Americans mostly ignored Japan's growing strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon was the first president to devote major attention to Japan. At a time 
when high tariffs, non-tariff barriers, import quotas, and obstacles to foreign 
investment handcuffed American businessmen here, Nixon spent two years and five 
months bludgeoning Japan into implementing restraints on 18 categories of 
textiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some Japanese textile items had gained as much as a 50% share of the 
American market, at the time Japan accounted for only 3% of total textile sales 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of American attention also has allowed problems to grow to the point 
where solutions became virtually impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's share of the U.S. market for television sets, for example, tripled to 
reach 30% during a 1974-76 period in U.S.-Japan economic relations that 
American officials described as "trouble-free." Only in 1977 did Japan 
implement a program to restrain exports of television sets. And it was not 
until Japanese cars seized nearly 20% of the American market in 1981 that 
Washington forced Japan to implement "voluntary" restraints on those exports. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the only firms that manufacture TV sets in the United States are 
foreign-owned -- mostly Japanese. And cars built by Japanese-owned firms last 
year held a 29% share of the U.S. passenger car market, an increase of about 
10% since the export restraints went into effect. (Japanese auto makers' 
investments in plants in the United States provided the growth.) By contrast, 
the Big Three hold a 0.29% share of the car market in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Not until the Reagan Administration did the United States begin to focus on 
non-tariff barriers and the workings of the Japanese economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite claims by Clinton Administration officials that "nothing works" to 
drive down Japanese surpluses, history shows that a booming Japanese economy 
does pull in imports and cut red ink. Three times since 1966, the U.S. deficit 
with Japan has fallen. Most recently, from 1988 through 1990, red ink plummeted 
by 31% as American exports to Japan leaped by $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Japan's economy fell into sluggishness in 1991, American export 
growth halted. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, appreciation in the value of the yen initially drives up the U.S. 
deficit. But if the pattern of the past repeats itself, the 20% appreciation of 
the yen since the beginning of 1993 will drive down Japan's surpluses later 
this year or next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Japan's economic friction with the United States has precipitated 
proposals for fundamental change that, if implemented, might indeed reduce 
Japan's surpluses permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 Various Japanese leaders have essentially echoed American assertions that 
Japan needs to change its culture to be more receptive to imports. Prime 
ministers back to Tanaka (1972-74) have talked about reversing Japan's 
priorities from "production first" to "living standards first" to promote 
domestic-led growth and pull in imports. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way we can solve (the problem of land prices) is to start building 
skyscrapers," Tanaka said shortly before he took over as prime minister. "Yet 
today the average height of a building in Tokyo is only 1.7 stories. We should 
start restricting not the height of buildings but rather the lowness of them. 
(For) so many of our problems, what we must do is totally reverse our present 
policies and laws." 
</P>
<P>
 A report drawn up under Yasuhiro Nakasone in 1986, known as the Maekawa 
report, proposed no less than a restructuring of the entire economy so that the 
country would rely wholly on domestic demand for growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Such changes were taken up under the so-called Structural Impediments 
Initiative under President George Bush, with some success. Japan agreed to 
increase its public works spending for 10 years. Large retail stores, which 
tend to handle imports, have found it far easier to establish new outlets since 
then. And Japan's Fair Trade Commission at least has started acting against 
collusive practices that help keep foreigners out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the average height of buildings in Tokyo is still 1.7 stories. Calls for 
overall government deregulation, most recently taken up by Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa, have not produced any action. And not one major Japanese 
automaker has reduced its reliance on exports below 37% of its total 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the 1960s, Americans were battling Japanese government quotas on 
imports of even such items as chewing gum and ketchup, not to mention 
computers. Even non-quota items required import licenses, copies of which were 
sent to responsible government bureaucrats, who could exert pressures on 
potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, Japan had the world's second-highest tariffs -- an average of 11% -- 
on manufactured goods, after Britain. Now, it maintains the lowest average -- 
1.9% -- of any advanced nation. And import quotas on beef and citrus fruit have 
been removed. 
</P>
<P>
 A "nightmare" that William E. Brock said he suffered as Reagan's trade 
representative in the early 1980s -- that "Japan does everything we ask it to 
do, and we wind up with no change in our trade deficit" -- has in effect come 
true, at least in part. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that many, if not all, government obstacles have been removed, the 
business practices and mind-sets of Japanese corporations and consumers shape 
up as the biggest headache. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's markets have nonetheless opened up far more than Americans are willing 
to recognize. Just four days before Clinton and Hosokawa fell out at their 
Washington summit Feb. 11, Clinton's own economic advisers issued a report -- 
one the President ignored -- suggesting that removal of all Japanese barriers 
would shave the $60-billion U.S. trade deficit by only $9 billion to $18 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, much of the American trade deficit with Japan has been created by 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of some $60 billion of Japanese exports to the United States, about one-third 
-- more than $19 billion -- are parts which American companies import from 
Japan. . . . Japan is being used to help make American products," Nakasone said 
in 1985.  
</P>
<P>
 In autos -- which alone account for more than 60% of the American deficit -- 
there is no question that American manufacturers were kept out of the market 
here during the days of boom growth.  
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s, Japan forbade foreign investment in its auto industry, imposed 
tariffs of up to 40% on imported cars, and limited the number of foreign car 
salesrooms to 10 per company. Today, American auto makers hold minority shares 
in Japanese auto firms, are free to build factories of their own, and face no 
tariffs on either cars or auto parts. Nor do limits on establishing showrooms 
exist any longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the main obstacle is persuading established dealers in Japan to handle 
American cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The only remaining government barrier -- Japanese safety standards that force 
American auto makers to remodel the cars they ship here -- could be eliminated 
by building the cars to meet the standards in the first place, as the Japanese 
do with cars they ship to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of change have emerged only recently. Chrysler's new Neon and General 
Motors' Saturn models are considered potential winners here -- although they 
are not yet on sale. And all of the Big Three have finally declared they will 
install right-hand drive in the cars they ship to Japan, where cars run on the 
left side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 But between the 19,000 cars that the Big Three sold in Japan last year and the 
2,482,345 that the Japanese sold in the United States lies a long, long road. 
US-JAPAN TRADE TENSIONS: VOICES THROUGH THE YEARS 
</P>
<P>
 Maurice H. Stans, Commerce secretary, May, 1969: "It is no accident that the 
U.S.-Japan Security Treaty commits our two nations to seek to eliminate 
conflicts in their international economic policies. Without conscious effort of 
political will, our economic disputes could tear the fabric of our alliance." 
</P>
<P>
 President Richard Nixon, in a foreign policy report, May, 1973: "No nation can 
expect to enjoy for long the fruits of a one-way policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, May, 1980:"If it is impossible or impractical for the 
Japanese to buy more from us, then we must be prepared to purchase less from 
them. I can see no good reason for the United States to commit economic 
hara-kiri on the altar of a bogus free-trade relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Malcolm Baldrige, Commerce secretary, October, 1981: 'In the past, it's been 
mostly the Congress which has been worried about this (U.S. imbalance in trade 
with Japan). Now it's the Congress and the Administration. . . . The trade 
imbalance cannot keep growing like this, even between friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Akio Morita, Sony chairman, March, 1982: "Americans are trying to impose their 
own laws and their own ways of life on the rest of the world. . . .Things 
appear to have gotten as bad as they were on the eve of World War II." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert A. Mosbacher, Commerce secretary, March, 1990: "No system can long 
function in a state of permanent disequilibrium. There will be corrections."

VIEW FROM WASHINGTON / JAMES RISEN; TYSON'S ACADEMIC TOME SETS TONE FOR 
CLINTON'S STAND ON JAPANESE TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a great scene in the movie "Patton" that seems relevant today in the 
budding trade conflict between the United States and Japan. Early in the film, 
George C. Scott, playing Gen. George S. Patton Jr., triumphantly surveys the 
North African battlefield on which his U.S. troops have just wrecked the Afrika 
Korps of Germany's military genius, Field Marshal Irwin Rommel.  
</P>
<P>
 "Rommel!" Patton shouts, "I read your book!" 
</P>
<P>
 Know your adversary. That's one of the oldest rules of combat. So maybe 
Japan's trade negotiators should read the collected works of one Laura D'Andrea 
Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
 Only rarely do academic publications have any impact on public policy. But 
Tyson, now the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, wrote a dry tome 
just before she joined the Clinton team that now reads eerily like a memo to 
the President on how to deal with Japan.  
</P>
<P>
 In her book, "Who's Bashing Whom?" -- published in November, 1992 (Institute 
for International Economics, $25 paperback), while she was still teaching at UC 
Berkeley -- Tyson devoted most of one chapter to a case study of Motorola 
Inc.'s attempts to break into the Japanese cellular telephone market. 
</P>
<P>
 Funny, but that's the very case the Clinton Administration has chosen to take 
a stand on in its new policy of brinkmanship with Japan.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Tyson, who has been right in the middle of every key White House 
decision on Japan policy, acknowledged in an interview that the Administration 
is following the blueprint for aggressive action on Motorola that she laid out 
in her book. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a consensus on Japan policy that has developed that is very 
similar to what I wrote," she said. "U.S. policy is now consistent with what I 
wrote." 
</P>
<P>
 So what is Tyson's bottom line on Motorola? 
</P>
<P>
 In documenting the long history of the case, which has been hanging fire since 
the Reagan years, Tyson argues in the volume that the key lesson to be learned 
is this: Only when the United States gets tough with Japan do the Japanese 
respond. What's more, she says American policy-makers should drop their fear of 
appearing too tough and instead demand specific results and "trade outcomes" 
from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, U.S. negotiators often forged legalistic trade agreements that 
resulted in superficial changes in Japanese trading procedures -- but not in 
any real increase in Japanese purchases of U.S. goods. By contrast, Tyson says, 
the Motorola case teaches that American negotiators shouldn't be afraid to get 
their hands dirty and push for specific trade gains for specific firms -- 
especially if a U.S. corporation can make a good case that it has been wronged. 
"The Motorola story indicates that the distinction between trade management 
through establishing better rules and managed trade through establishing trade 
outcomes or results is overly simplistic and misleading," she writes. 
"Paradoxically, in Japan's heavily managed market, something akin to managed 
trade was needed to achieve something akin to market competition."  
</P>
<P>
 As she describes the early years of the case, Tyson writes most admiringly of 
American policy-makers when they show flashes of steel. The Reagan 
Administration got results, she says, when it got tough and had Secretary of 
State George P. Schultz intervene with the Japanese on Motorola's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unilateral pressure and bilateral negotiations were essential for the 
enforcement of negotiated agreements," Tyson writes. "It took direct personal 
pressure from the U.S. secretary of state to compel" Japanese compliance with 
previously negotiated agreements on the cellular phone trade. 
</P>
<P>
 During the early days of the Bush Administration, Motorola once again got 
Japan's attention, she says, by filing a so-called Super 301 trade complaint 
with the U.S. trade representative's office. Such a complaint of unfair trading 
practices, if approved, requires American retaliation. Motorola's case marked 
one of the first uses of what was dubbed the "nuclear bomb" in the U.S. trade 
arsenal.  
</P>
<P>
 In other words, Tyson argues, when dealing with Japan, it is best to carry a 
big stick.  
</P>
<P>
 Tyson sees the Motorola story as a model for policy-making for many of the 
same reasons the Clinton Administration has now selected it as a test case in 
its confrontation with Japan. Simply put, the Motorola case offers some of the 
best evidence that Japan is an unfair trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Tyson writes, Motorola was a world leader in cellular phone 
technology, leapfrogging the best systems Japanese firms had to offer. Yet the 
Schaumburg, Ill., firm consistently was denied access to the Japanese market. 
Subtle, non-tariff barriers were thrown in its way both by Japanese 
corporations and the Japanese government. But the end result was almost the 
same as if Japan had imposed prohibitive tariffs or quotas on U.S. imports. In 
the mid-1980s, bureaucratic delays kept Motorola at bay long enough to give 
Japanese firms time to catch up with its technology.  
</P>
<P>
 "The telecommunications market in Japan . . . (is) heavily managed," writes 
Tyson. "In this industry more than most, there was a close alliance between 
Japanese bureaucratic authorities and Japanese business interests, an alliance 
that worked to the disadvantage of outsiders." 
</P>
<P>
 Even after the Japanese grudgingly began to open the market to Motorola under 
prodding from the Reagan and Bush administrations, the government and the 
Japanese telecommunications industry still sought to exclude the U.S. 
competitor from the lucrative Tokyo metropolitan market. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Clinton Administration's charge that Japan has failed to live up 
to a 1989 agreement to open the Tokyo region to Motorola lies at the heart of 
the current trade dispute. In response to what it sees as Japanese 
intransigence on the Motorola case, the Administration is widely expected to 
announce later this month that it will slap roughly $300 million in sanctions 
on a variety of Japanese imports to the United States.  
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, however, the Motorola case has been simply a convenient vehicle 
for the Administration as it seeks to send a broader message to Japan about 
trade. And for anyone who bothered to check, that message was clearly written 
by Laura Tyson nearly a year and a half ago.

LEGACY OF THE SOLE; FRANCISCAN CONTINUES ART OF HANDCRAFTING SANDALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's no need to sell Brother Sebastian Tobin on the health and style 
benefits of sandals. 
</P>
<P>
 The 56-year-old Franciscan spends his days at a workbench in New York City's 
St. Francis of Assisi Parish, where he handcrafts leather sandals for church 
and lay customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how many pairs I make a year," Tobin said. "All I know is that 
I'm about six months behind on orders. There are only a handful of people who 
do what I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Tobin predicts that sales at shoe companies such as Deckers Outdoor Corp., 
Nike and others will boom as manufacturers try to sell consumers on the 
benefits of performance-oriented sandals. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what the industry is pushing," Tobin said. "They've been making a lot 
of money on sneakers, and now they want to make a lot of money on sandals." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the big companies' designs, Tobin's are custom-made. He starts with 
precise measurements and an outline of each customer's foot. He also customizes 
sandals for customers with hammertoes or bunions. 
</P>
<P>
 Handcrafted leather shoes are expensive -- Tobin's sandals start at $75 a pair 
-- but "they're also going to last for quite a few summers," he said. "Some of 
our guys who wear them (year-round) find they last for 20 to 25 years . . . 
with just having them resoled and re-heeled." 
</P>
<P>
 Tobin, who reads shoe industry magazines and attends an occasional trade show, 
sees signs that sandals are coming on strong. "Wait and see," he said. "They'll 
be in all the stores." 
</P>
<P>
 But don't expect Tobin to sport a pair of Deckers' new Teva Terradactyl sport 
sandals. "I don't think it would be right," he said, "if I was wearing theirs 
while trying to sell mine." GREG JOHNSON

ELECTRICAL WORKERS UNION WINS DELCO ELECTION BY 1 VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By a margin of a single vote, the electronic workers union has won the right 
to represent the 300 hourly workers at General Motors Corp.'s Delco Remy 
battery plant in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The 149-148 vote was announced last week after the National Labor Relations 
Board counted nine disputed ballots left over from a Dec. 9 organizing 
election.Going into Monday's count, the International Union of Electronic, 
Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers held a six-vote lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The union's narrow victory after an eight-month organizing drive ends the 
Anaheim facility's reign as the only non-union General Motors automotive 
components factory in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a seven-day waiting period before the final vote can be certified, 
but union officials said they have no reason to think that General Motors will 
challenge the results. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the company said in a prepared statement that it "anticipates the 
relationship with the IUE (union) to grow and to be compatible" with the 
company's objectives. About 40 management and supervisory employees will not be 
represented by the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Warshauser, organizing director for the union's West Coast region, said the 
Delco Remy employees represent the largest single group of workers to unionize 
in Orange County and the southern and central sections of Los Angeles County in 
the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Delco Remy plant was built in 1954 and had never before been unionized. 
Warshauser said that, while there had been earlier organizing attempts at the 
plant, "nothing had been done in the last 10 years."

BRIEFLY; RESEARCH: NEW GROUP FOUNDED TO FIGHT DIABETES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attorney Andrew Katzenstein of Santa Monica has founded Cure Diabetes Now, a 
nonprofit organization supporting diabetes research. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenstein, who will be president, says the organization will focus on 
research aimed at finding a cure for diabetes rather than on educational or 
diagnostic work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Diabetes researchers are doing wonderful things, but many are dealing with 
the peripheral effects of the disease rather than the disease itself," he said. 
"We have one purpose only: to find a cure."

ISRAELI WEST BANK SETTLERS' DILEMMA: STAY OR MOVE ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Baruch and his wife, Ravit, left their modern, red-roofed home in this 
Jewish settlement after dark one day last week, taking a drive to the Tel Aviv 
hospital where Ravit was scheduled for a kidney transplant the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli troops, mistaking the Israelis for Palestinian terrorists, opened fire 
on the couple's Renault, killing 30-year-old David and injuring Ravit. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 13,000 settlers in Ariel, the tragedy renewed a debate that is echoing 
across the West Bank's Jewish settlements. The almost idyllic life in these 
modern hilltop communities has been punctured by the fear that rules the roads 
the settlers must take between Israel and the Palestinian-populated regions. 
</P>
<P>
 A pregnant woman, the mother of two, was killed by Palestinians at almost the 
same spot just weeks earlier. And the region is girding for revenge attacks 
following the massacre of 48 Palestinians by a Jewish settler in Hebron last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 130,000 settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, who make up just a 
fraction of Israel's 5.3 million citizens, have a more pressing worry. It is 
that the Israeli government will relinquish its occupied territory and leave 
those communities in the middle of a Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
 And a debate now rages among the residents of Ariel, 30 miles east of Tel 
Aviv, over whether they should stay or go live elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ready to leave now, and there are plenty of people like me," said Yitzhak 
Kopler, 42, who lives with his wife and a teen-age son in a three-bedroom 
apartment here. "I feel like a guard dog for the government." 
</P>
<P>
 The apartment he bought here a dozen years ago for $120,000, with easy 
government-assisted financing designed to encourage such settlers, "wouldn't 
get me $50,000 today," he said. His hope is that the government will give the 
settlers similar accommodations on Israeli soil. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yigal Rosenthal, the deputy mayor and one of the settlement's founders, 
hopes the government will keep Ariel alive. On a coffee table in the waiting 
room at Rosenthal's city office is a petition demanding that the government 
pull out of peace talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation today is impossible," Rosenthal said. "And it is the 
responsibility of the government to rectify it." 
</P>
<P>
 He has shelved his original plan to create a settlement of 100,000 people 
here. New arrivals have dropped off since the government removed its subsidies 
on home purchases in the settlements a year ago. And about 500 new apartments 
and houses are vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every family, every individual, including myself, is asking themselves: How 
can I live here? What should I do? We are not cows. We are thinking people." 
</P>
<P>
 He has his doubts about whether people will want to stay, especially after the 
accidental killing of David Baruch. "You can't blame the army for mistakes," he 
said. "It's impossible to deal with terrorists and protect us. But I don't know 
how our people will react. Only fools are prophets these days." 
</P>
<P>
 Ehud Sprinzak, a professor at Hebrew University, says that the Hebron 
massacre, carried out by an extremist Jewish settler, and the Palestinian riots 
that have followed have been a major blow to the cause of Jewish settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people talk about settlers, even in Israel, they tend to lump them all 
together," Sprinzak said. "That's incorrect, but we're talking about images. 
And the image of the settler community has been damaged considerably." 
</P>
<P>
 The government is not going to take any action to eliminate the settlements 
now, Sprinzak contends, because it wants to use them as a bargaining chip in 
its negotiations with the Palestinians. "But if this peace process is 
successful, they will have to be evacuated. And there is growing anxiety." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the 140 settlements in the West Bank and Gaza are the creations of 
ideological Jews staking a claim to the biblical lands of Israel. But others -- 
like Ariel, one of the largest -- were settled by Israelis whose main goal was 
to have more space and more affordable housing. It is these settlers who are 
ready to bail out, though they are trapped by their pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although house prices in Israel have increased sharply in the past decade, 
values in the settler communities have fallen precipitously. 
</P>
<P>
 Abraham Miles, a 51-year-old businessman, sold his house in Tel Aviv 13 years 
ago to move to Ariel, where the proceeds bought a much larger home. He figures 
his Ariel home is worth about $90,000 now, barely enough to buy a one-room 
apartment in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
 "In no way, shape or form did religious ideology bring me here," Miles said. 
"And I'd say 95% of the residents are like me. They came to improve the quality 
of their life. But that quality has disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
 His two grown children have gone off to school in Jerusalem, but they are 
afraid to risk their lives on the roads to visit Ariel. 
</P>
<P>
 About half the residents of Ariel make the 45-minute commute to jobs in Tel 
Aviv. And trouble on that road, where Baruch was killed and others have been 
pelted with stones and gunfire from Palestinians, has been increasing ever 
since the Israeli government signed its initial peace pact with the PLO in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 Yitzhak Kopler's taxi was pelted with stones twice last week as he drove 
customers to Jerusalem. And his out-of-town business, as well as his nighttime 
trade, has dried up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day gets a little more difficult," he said. "People are afraid to leave 
this community. There's no going or coming. The community is under siege from 
dusk until dawn." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other residents, Kopler wrestles with the moral issues as well. Do the 
Jewish people have the right to this land? "From the standpoint of the Bible, 
we have a right," he said. "But who am I to take away the right of someone who 
was here before me? If I take his land today, then he will take it away from me 
tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to think differently," he added. "But now I'm willing to give 
everything for peace and serenity. The Palestinian people have risen up, and 
they are right. We should give them what they want." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who want to stay, though, are Lila and Joel Bernstein, Americans 
who have lived in Israel for 23 years and moved here seven years ago. Lila, a 
56-year-old nurse, runs the local retirement center, the Warm-Hearted Club. Her 
husband is an electrical engineer in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
 They have four children, all of whom have served in the Israeli military. They 
moved here because the 1,500-foot elevation was good for Joel Bernstein's 
asthma and because, although they are not very religious, "biblically, we feel 
we should be here," Lila said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the people I know are very angry, very sad and very depressed about 
the situation," she added. "It's difficult to live with all this tension. But 
we're here. This is my home. And I don't want to give up my home." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bernsteins want to stay in their four-bedroom home, and they say they 
would never ask the government for compensation, as some have suggested as a 
way to get the settlers to move. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not ogres or mean people," Lila said, adding that she was shocked and 
angered by the mosque massacre. "We're just ordinary people. Good people. You 
don't have to be religious to have strong feelings about something. But I just 
hope I'm strong enough to stay." 
</P>

COLUMN ONE; SKATEBOARD PROS: LIFE ON THE EDGE; HARD-CORE RIDERS THRIVE ON 
THRILLS AND AN INCREASINGLY REBELLIOUS LIFESTYLE. TWO RECENT MURDER CASES MAKE 
SOME SKATERS WONDER IF THE REBELLION HAS GONE TOO FAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joshua Swindell notched his first speeding ticket at age 14, clocking 47 
m.p.h. down a hill in Diamond Bar -- on a skateboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear was not in his blood. He liked to live on the edge, to push the limit. By 
his late teens, the gangly, towheaded youth was a rising star in the hard-edged 
world of professional skateboarding, traveling and hauling down $50,000 a year, 
plus royalties on his own line of custom boards. 
</P>
<P>
 In a world that pays homage to narcissism and nerve, Swindell found his niche. 
He liked to drink, party, chase women. He was brash, charming, funny and, when 
necessary, a fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Swindell's life was far removed from the thousands of youngsters who simply 
cruise their driveways after dinner or ride their boards to school. Instead, he 
moved among the hard-core vanguards of the sport, a rebel element hellbent on 
maximum risk and ultimate thrills, an assortment of taggers, rap singers, 
entrepreneurs and highly paid pros with back-yard ramps. 
</P>
<P>
 Barreling through that culture, Swindell was just another free-wheeling 
skateboard star -- until he crashed. His fall from grace has raised troubling 
questions within a sport whose most avid followers tend to teeter on society's 
fringe. 
</P>
<P>
 Swindell was one of many revelers at a private rap music party in Azusa last 
July. Late in the night, he was seen escorting a disoriented young man away 
from the event. The man was later found bloody and dying in a clump of bushes. 
Arrested on suspicion of murder, Swindell, 21, pleaded not guilty and is in 
jail awaiting trial next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident has echoed through California's skate shops, streets and 
beachside skateboarding hangouts with an unsettling sense of deja vu. Just 18 
months earlier, in a sensational scandal involving one of skateboarding's 
biggest stars, Mark Anthony (Gator) Rogowski pleaded guilty to raping and 
murdering a woman at his condominium in Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
 The two cases have deepened the concern of critics -- including some of the 
stars who lifted the sport to prominence. They fear that skateboarding's 
antisocial elements are already too strong, and that the worst impulses of 
wayward youth are being fed by the sport's multimillion-dollar marketing 
machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 Ads, magazines and videos produced by current and former stars are often 
directed toward dysfunctional teen-agers and do little but encourage reckless 
behavior, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happened is that the sport's now run primarily by a bunch of young 
kids who don't have . . . (much) perspective," said Stacy Peralta, 35, one of 
skateboarding's top stars and entrepreneurs throughout the 1970s before 
becoming a television director. "It just seems like nobody gives a damn anymore 
. . . about the kid on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Skaters see it differently. To many of them, society is the enemy -- a rigid, 
nameless grid of rules and attitudes. Those rules include bans against 
skateboarding in city after city. To them, being a skater means being a rugged 
survivor, a target of bias and police harassment, a refugee of skate parks 
closed because of liability lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Skaters are not out to hurt anyone, said Christian Hosoi, 26, a superstar 
since turning pro at the age of 14. But they are angry. Hosoi says they have a 
fire burning inside them to set their own rules, to skate where they please, to 
grab for all they can -- and that becomes their reason for living. 
</P>
<P>
 "Skateboarders are headstrong . . . radical and extreme people," said Hosoi, 
who once appeared in one of the sport's leading magazines smoking a marijuana 
cigarette. "They want to let out their aggression through their art form, and 
not through their fists, or guns, or destruction or self-destruction." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout its cyclic evolution, skateboarding has soared and plunged through 
booms and busts and periods of inner turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 When the pastime first emerged in the late 1950s and early '60s, it was the 
province of generally clean-cut youngsters in California beach towns, where 
metal wheels were nailed onto 2-by-4s and kids called it "sidewalk surfing." No 
one took it seriously. It died out, then flourished again, with a harder edge, 
in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Metal wheels gave way to smoother polyurethane, and top riders discovered the 
rapture of contoured swimming pools. A revolutionary move -- "the Ollie," a 
hard down-kick on the tail of the board combined with a jump -- enabled skaters 
to become airborne. So, like primordial creatures, they ascended from the 
sidewalks onto curbs, handrails, picnic tables and other improbable venues. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the '70s, you had people bribing helicopter pilots with (drugs) to spot 
empty pools," said writer Neil Feineman, who is completing a history of the 
sport. "You were talking about a group of particularly dysfunctional kids. They 
didn't get their emotional security from home; they got it from their skate 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
 The best-known pros hung out in Santa Monica and called themselves "Dog Town," 
which "became slang for an aggressive, radical kind of skater," Feineman said. 
"They influenced all of skating, as we know it." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Dog Town skateboarder Jay Adams, now 33, recalled "sneaking in people's 
back yards and draining out their pools . . . destroying hotel rooms . . . 
drinking and (using) a little drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Adams drifted into the punk rock scene and one night, in a melee 
outside a Hollywood club, a gay man was beaten to death. "I got arrested for 
murder, convicted of assault," Adams said, expressing regret over the incident. 
"(But) I never even touched the guy who ended up dying." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he finished serving two months in Los Angeles County Jail, Adams 
was out of skateboarding. The sport was changing. Dog Town died out. Another 
down cycle was followed by a new talent explosion -- and a cleaner direction -- 
in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanky young Tony Hawk of Carlsbad burst onto the scene as the Michael Jordan 
of four-wheeled aerials, prompting a feature in Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Peralta, the first pro to become a major entrepreneur, popularized 
skateboarding videos and assembled a sort of "Dream Team" of touring stars who 
earned $100,000 to $250,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 He took pains to keep his athletes off drugs and to develop new talent slowly, 
Peralta said. Young skaters spent two years, on average, competing as amateurs 
before being considered for lucrative pro contracts. "If you take a kid that's 
13 years old, or 16 years old, and start paying him $10,000 (a month), that can 
blow his mind," Peralta said. 
</P>
<P>
 But after hitting a peak in the late 1980s, skateboarding started to retrench. 
Faced with a money squeeze, the industry began to abandon much of the 
mainstream to pursue mostly hard-core followers: teen-agers willing to plunk 
down $70 to $100 for the latest board, or willing to bloody themselves on the 
street emulating the miraculous moves of the hottest talents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we're really talking about . . . the ones for whom skateboarding is 
a lifestyle," said youth marketing consultant Irma Zandl of the Zandl Group in 
New York. "There's a lot of pride in getting hurt, in living (hard) and really 
taking it to the edge." 
</P>
<P>
 For evidence of that attitude, one need only peruse the pages of Big Brother 
magazine, the brash, uncensored voice of skateboarding's young iconoclasts. 
Among its fare: an account of the night that its publisher hired strippers for 
several of his pro skaters; a "how-to" guide on committing suicide, and a 
feature suggesting "18 Ways to Be an Ass----." (No. 18: "Run around town 
dressed as a clown and kick pregnant women in the stomach.") 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine's most jarring and controversial image surfaced in December: an 
ad for a new company, Bitch Skateboards. In the ad, a figure of a man stands 
next to a figure of a woman; he raises a handgun to her head. The ad has 
touched off a firestorm of protest among parents, particularly in El Segundo 
where the magazine is published. 
</P>
<P>
 Bitch founder Sal Rocco Jr. says the ad was merely a joke aimed at a rival 
company called Girl. He said he has no regrets. Violence, Rocco said, is 
everywhere -- in movies, even cartoons. And that is why some of the 
best-selling skateboards picture Charles Manson sporting a swastika or women in 
lingerie, bound and gagged. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids today are punks. . . . They tag and smoke weed and drink and most of 
them get prostitutes," the 26-year-old Rocco said. "That's the big thing now -- 
when they turn pro they get a whore. It's like a college initiation." 
</P>
<P>
 No one can say which came first: the bad behavior or the culture that promotes 
it. Either way, experts say, they feed off each other and can be damaging. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know one thing . . . we need to do a better job of teaching our young 
people to reject offensive, violent and disrespectful messages," said Michael 
S. Josephson, founder of the Joseph and Edna Josephson Institute of Ethics in 
Marina del Rey. "These messages go to abnormal people as well as to normal 
people. And abnormal people, fed the right diet and right dose, can be 
extraordinarily dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 In the wilder corners of the sport, skaters say the magazines are just 
harmless humor and they offer no apologies for their hedonistic philosophies. 
"With skateboarding comes the drugs and sex . . . but that's second," said 
Eddie Reategui, 26, who turned pro at the age of 16 and still skates in a 
$40,000, peanut-shaped pool in his back yard in Huntington Beach. 
"Skateboarding is the most important thing in our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Hosoi, Reategui's partner in a shop called Focus Skateboards, grew up in Los 
Angeles' Mid-Wilshire district, smoking marijuana as naturally as others smoke 
tobacco. Deploring the lack of public skateboarding facilities, he spoke 
defiantly: "What we've got to do is what we've got to do -- go skateboarding. 
(Teen-agers) are not going to stop skating because they're going to ruin some 
marble bench. If it comes to scraping up a handrail in front of some 
million-dollar corporate building, I don't think we're going to think twice 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kareem Campbell, a 20-year-old pro from South-Central, said he has been in "20 
or 30" fights in the last five years because non-skaters taunt him. They call 
him "an Oreo" or an "Uncle Tom" for skating and being black, he said. He sets 
them straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Since turning pro two years ago, however, he has begun savoring the best of 
what skateboarding has to offer -- travel, women and good times. "You can 
party, like, 24 hours a day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wild times and brazen ads are one thing; murder is another. Even in a sport 
where petty trespassing and vandalism are often celebrated as youthful high 
jinks, there were lines that were not crossed -- until Gator Rogowski. 
</P>
<P>
 High-flying Rogowski was one of the brightest stars skateboarding had produced 
when he raped, then suffocated, a 21-year-old friend of his ex-girlfriend in 
his Carlsbad condo. The crime, three years ago this month, was skateboarding's 
greatest scandal, making national headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogowski was only 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The girlfriend had dumped him for another man. Unable to find her, he took 
revenge on her close friend. He buried the body in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, he broke down and apologized in a written statement to the court, 
blaming his actions in part on pornography: "Smut becomes food for thought, 
then fuel for action, equivalent to the most entrapping of drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 But there were deeper factors. "Gator . . . had something in him that would 
make him snap," one former friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 A psychiatric report prepared during his trial seemed to support that opinion. 
Rogowski had been an abused child, a psychiatrist noted. A drug user at 17, 
then an alcoholic, Rogowski was rigid, oversensitive and manic-depressive. He 
also showed some psychotic symptoms, the psychiatrist concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rogowski case sent a tremor through the skateboard world, Joshua 
Swindell has triggered the aftershock that raises questions about the direction 
in which the sport is heading and what role, if any, it played in the troubles 
of its stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Swindell had driven up from Carlsbad with Danny Way, another top star, to 
attend a rap party at a rented bar. A scrawny man named Keith Ogden crashed the 
event, according to court records. Witnesses would later testify at a 
preliminary hearing that Ogden, 31, approached Way outside the bar and flashed 
some bills in an apparent bid to buy sexual favors. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ogden persisted, according to Way's testimony, Way knocked him out with 
one punch -- after which a club bouncer did the same to Way. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men were dragged inside. Later in the night, several attempts were made 
to send Ogden away; the last involved Swindell and a 17-year-old skateboarding 
friend. They were seen dragging and kicking Ogden across a street, one witness 
testified at the preliminary hearing late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogden's body was found in the bushes a short while later. He was dead before 
paramedics could save him. "His face was beaten beyond recognition," said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Patricia Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one reported seeing the attack, police arrested Swindell and his 
friend on murder charges. Each has pleaded not guilty, contending that Ogden -- 
who had sneaked out of a hospital only days earlier -- was dying from a blow to 
the head he had received before his encounter with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Swindell's reputation as a loudmouth and attention-seeker, he was not 
regarded as having as troubled a personality as Gator's. "He's not like a 
Jeffrey Dahmer. . . . He's just a punk kid," former top pro skateboarder Rodney 
Mullen said of Swindell. "He's a little tough, yeah, but there were so many 
people so much tougher." 
</P>
<P>
 Raised in Diamond Bar by parents who were bitterly divorced when he was in his 
early teens, Swindell grew up rebellious, outspoken but honest, said his 
father, Joe. The young Swindell liked to look out for the underdog; more than 
once, he fought to defend a neighbor boy born clubfooted, the father said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there were brushes with authority. The most serious made Swindell 
something of an outlaw hero in January of last year, when he and a friend left 
a skating show in San Diego, started drinking and were arrested in Mexico after 
firearms were found hidden in a team van. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrasher, another skateboarding magazine, ran a headline -- "Jailed . . . 
first Gator, now Swindell, you're next!!!" -- along with an interview with 
Swindell in a Tijuana holding cell. The skater complained about a cellmate 
"singing Menudo songs all night long" and boasted of bloodying the mouth of a 
man who wanted his shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Annie Swindell worked three months to free her son, by which time Swindell 
seemed "hardened," according to one friend. The skater designed two new boards 
illustrating life behind bars; in one, his own face appeared in the cross-hairs 
of a guard's rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Angry at the world," said one friend, who asked not to be identified, in 
describing Swindell's attitude. "I (thought), 'This guy's going to jail 
sometime, or this guy's going to be dead.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Annie Swindell has a much different opinion. At the time of the Azusa party, 
her son was getting his life together, learning to face responsibility. He was 
probably trying to send Ogden away for his own good, she said. The arrest was 
just another act of bias against skateboarders. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Josh fought with the guy, the guy ran, literally stumbling across the 
street to get away from him," Annie Swindell said. "(That was) the last moment 
Josh saw him -- alive." 
</P>
<P>
 In a visitor's booth at Los Angeles County Jail, where he talked on condition 
that the case not be discussed, the young skateboarder seemed in good spirits, 
glad for company. Boyish and glib, he chatted about "the nightmare" of Mexican 
jail, about allegedly bribing authorities there and about the enormous 
dedication that professional skateboarding requires. 
</P>
<P>
 A story came to mind -- an incident that he said shows what a bad rap 
skateboarders get: Swindell remembered when a friend came out with a board 
design, a step-by-step graphic illustrating how to make a pipe bomb. One of the 
boards and some apparent bomb-making materials were confiscated from some 
teen-ager's locker, in New York or someplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were trying to blame (the skater) for it," Swindell said, incredulously, 
grinning as a guard arrived to reapply the handcuffs and lead him back to his 
isolation cell.

NEWS ANALYSIS; HIGH-PROFILE LOSSES TARNISH REPUTATION OF D.A.'S OFFICE; 
JUSTICE: PROSECUTORS WIN MOST CASES, BUT FAILURES LIKE MENENDEZ AND MCMARTIN 
INVITE CRITICISM OF TACTICS. 
</P>

<P>
 The Los Angeles County district attorney's office doesn't just help solve 
mysteries anymore. It has become one. 
</P>
<P>
 When no one's watching, the office racks up convictions in four trials out of 
five. 
</P>
<P>
 But when everyone's watching, the office looks like a lightweight, losing far 
more high-publicity cases than it wins. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider its poor track record in some of the most klieg-lighted cases of the 
last decade: "Twilight Zone," McMartin, King, Denny, Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Gilbert Garcetti and his top aides say it is unfair to evaluate 
the office, which prosecutes more than 50,000 felonies a year, on the basis of 
a handful of cases that fascinated the media over a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 But these few failures in the spotlight leave lasting impressions and have 
diminished public confidence in an important crime-fighting institution. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are poking fun at us," Garcetti acknowledged last week during a 
meeting with his deputies. And that makes some career prosecutors angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a laughingstock," said veteran Deputy Dist. Atty. Sterling Norris, who 
ran for district attorney in 1992. Referring to the Rodney G. King and Reginald 
O. Denny beating trials and the Lyle and Erik Menendez case, he said: "It's not 
often the D.A. can burn down half the city, alienate half the city, then turn 
around and lose a major murder case." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for Norris' disenchantment is that the district attorney's office 
is expected to win. Prosecutors pick their shots, choosing which cases to file 
and which charges to bring, all with the help of a manual that instructs them 
to base their decisions partly on a belief that they can win. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do win most of our trials," said Pamela Bozanich, the lead prosecutor in 
the Menendez trial, which ended in January with juries unable to reach 
verdicts. "We're supposed to." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, each year for more than a decade, the district attorney's office has 
won convictions of the charged or lesser offenses in 75% to 80% of its 2,500 or 
so felony trials. The vast majority of felony cases are settled through plea 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the district attorney's difficulties with cases tried under the glare 
of publicity are a popular topic of conversation within the legal community. 
Three dozen prosecutors, defense lawyers, judges and law professors interviewed 
for this article advanced many theories to explain why the district attorney's 
office has more often than not failed when in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Some theories centered on problems within the office, while others focused on 
factors that are inherent in high-publicity cases, and are thus outside the 
district attorney's control, such as the allure of fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Fame may make it more difficult for jurors to convict a defendant, even if the 
defendant's celebrity status is derived from his or her alleged crime, some 
lawyers and judges say. They cite a string of acquittals around the country in 
high-profile cases involving such notables as Lorena Bobbitt, Imelda Marcos, 
William Kennedy Smith, and just last week, the Branch Davidians. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite what may be a national trend, some lawyers and judges say the Los 
Angeles district attorney's office may be responsible for some of its own 
difficulties, because: 
</P>
<P>
 * It doesn't always tap the best prosecutors available. Some prosecutors and a 
judge went so far as to suggest that elected district attorneys do not want to 
give their most talented subordinates public platforms from which to launch 
political careers. The three most recently elected district attorneys, 
Garcetti, Ira Reiner and Robert Philibosian, reject that suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 * It has had trouble hanging on to some of its better prosecutors, losing many 
to the judiciary. Former Gov. George Deukmejian drew on the office in 
extraordinary fashion, naming more than 100 Los Angeles deputy district 
attorneys to the bench in the 1980s. "It was nice to have one of your 
colleagues elevated to a judgeship but there was a price this office paid for 
that loss of talent," said a high-ranking deputy in the 850-lawyer office. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prosecutors assigned to high-profile cases are not given adequate support. 
Prosecutors are typically viewed by the public as having the awesome power of 
the state behind them. But their resources are sometimes limited compared to 
expensive defense attorneys on these cases. While preparing for the Menendez 
trial, Bozanich had to learn word processing programs so she could type her own 
motions; her office said there was no money to provide her with a secretary. 
Defense attorneys in the case had the proceeds from a multimillion-dollar 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
 * Elected district attorneys may have gotten carried away by emotions or 
politics and charged defendants with more crimes than they could prove. When 
this kind of overcharging occurs in response to public pressure, as some 
believe it did in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case and in the Denny 
beating case, a backlash can occur, resulting in a win for the defense and a 
loss of faith in the prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prosecutors in Los Angeles may be ill-trained to try high-publicity cases. 
"I don't want to say the D.A.'s office stinks," said Myrna Raeder, an expert in 
the rules of criminal evidence who teaches at Southwestern University School of 
Law. "It's untrue. It's unfair. But they're ignoring what grips the public, 
what grips the jury" when they make dry, factual presentations in cases that 
pose difficult emotional questions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Menendez case, for example, the two men who admitted shotgunning their 
parents to death offered an excuse that resonated with many jurors: They had 
been sexually abused by their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 But some observers said prosecutors could have overcome the defense's portrait 
of the men as victims if they had shucked their restraint and shouted: So what? 
 
</P>
<P>
 "Can the fact that something terrible has been done to you justify 
premeditated murder? That's the issue that had to be argued," said Harland 
Braun, a former deputy district attorney who has become a successful defense 
lawyer. "Death Rows are loaded with people with backgrounds as bad as Erik 
Menendez. . . . We convict them because it's necessary to protect society." 
</P>
<P>
 Failure to address an issue that lies just beneath the surface of a case may 
have also hampered the district attorney's office in the Denny trial. In that 
case, several black men were prosecuted on charges of beating and robbing Denny 
and other white, Asian American and Latino motorists in the early moments of 
the 1992 riots that erupted after the first King trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks, broadcast live on television from an intersection that police had 
deserted, became a powerful and frightening symbol of police failure to keep 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when the focus shifted to the defendants, the symbolism shifted too. 
The defendants were portrayed as scapegoats of a racist society that acquits 
police officers whose beating of a black man was seen worldwide on videotape, 
then throws the book at African Americans who rise up in protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiner, who served as Los Angeles County district attorney from 1984 to 1992, 
said the defense made the case a "symbol . . . of the entire question of race 
in contemporary America. . . . How you decided the case really set out how you 
felt about the symbol." 
</P>
<P>
 But the prosecution, Raeder said, decided to pretend the symbolism wasn't 
there. "Here we have a situation where people are doing illegal activities 
which are clearly racially oriented, yet prosecutors tried to disassociate them 
from the larger context." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't work. Jurors rejected the prosecution's meticulously presented 
contention that the assailants were guilty of attempted murder and aggravated 
mayhem in the beating of Denny. The defendants were convicted of lesser 
charges, but the case is widely considered a loss for the district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 There may have been other flaws in the district attorney's handling of that 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had that case not occurred during the civil disturbance and not been on 
television, those guys would have had serious charges filed against them, but 
probably not attempted murder and aggravated mayhem," said Superior Court Judge 
James Albracht, who considers the case an example of overcharging. "And their 
bail would have been set at $25,000 to $40,000, not . . . in the hundreds of 
thousands of dollars. . . . I think people in the black community said there's 
something going on here that's not right . . . and that created a kind of 
backlash effect." 
</P>
<P>
 Albracht said he believes a more dramatic example of overcharging was the 
McMartin case, in which seven nursery school owners and teachers were accused 
in 1983 of molesting scores of preschoolers and held without bail, or on 
extremely high bail, for years. Ultimately, all were let go by the district 
attorney or by juries when it was shown that many of the alleged victims had 
been coached into making incriminating statements that could not be 
corroborated. 
</P>
<P>
 In an office in which many lawyers have 20 or more years experience, the 
prosecutors assigned to most of these cases were relatively inexperienced. 
</P>
<P>
 Lael Rubin had been a prosecutor less than six years when she was assigned to 
salvage the McMartin case -- a hopeless task, she says, because of a botched 
initial investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody could have gotten a conviction because of the flawed 
nature of the evidence, the interviews and the investigation," Rubin said. 
"There was a belief that we could overcome that." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry White was a nine-year veteran when he found himself prosecuting the four 
police officers accused of beating Rodney G. King, a black motorist who had led 
officers on a chase and was beaten when he failed to comply with their commands 
to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 Lea D'Agostino was also a nine-year veteran when she got the job of 
prosecuting film director John Landis and four colleagues for involuntary 
manslaughter in the deaths of two children and an actor during filming of the 
movie "Twilight Zone -- The Movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Longevity is certainly no guarantee of energy or skill. 
</P>
<P>
 But some speculate that elected district attorneys are loath to appoint 
lawyers of long tenure and proven accomplishment for fear that, once loosed in 
front of cameras, these lawyers might become well enough known to challenge the 
district attorney at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutors who secured the only two high-publicity victories for the 
district attorney's office during the last decade did not get other 
high-publicity cases to try. William Hodgman, who successfully prosecuted 
savings and loan operator Charles H. Keating Jr. for defrauding small 
investors, has become a key administrator. P. Philip Halpin, who in 1989 
prosecuted Richard Ramirez of the "Night Stalker" serial murders, works in a 
district attorney's branch office in San Fernando, deciding what charges to 
bring in cases filed there. 
</P>
<P>
 Halpin said recent district attorneys have "sent a clear message to young 
deputies that trial experience does not equate to promotion." 
</P>
<P>
 Sterling Norris is widely regarded as one of the office's premier trial 
attorneys, but he has not been assigned to the highest-profile cases since he 
successfully prosecuted "Freeway Killer" William Bonin in 1982, winning 
convictions on 10 murder counts. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're really, really good, that may hold you back," said Johnnie L. 
Cochran Jr., a leading defense attorney who was the No. 3 executive in the 
district attorney's office from 1978 to 1981. "Politically . . . you're a 
threat." 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran and many others, who did not want to be identified, also said district 
attorneys have placed too much emphasis on showcasing the office's ethnic and 
gender diversity in high-profile cases, rather than simply appointing the 
toughest prosecutors available. 
</P>
<P>
 In the McMartin, Denny, Menendez and "Twilight Zone" cases, they noted, the 
lead prosecutors were women; in King, the lead prosecutor was a black man. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes this desire for political correctness doesn't put your absolute 
best team forward," Cochran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti, Reiner and Philibosian disputed these assessments, saying they chose 
only the most qualified prosecutors available, then supervised them closely. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the prosecutors who were selected said that despite the involvement 
of the head of the office in their cases, they got very little in the way of 
investigative, legal research or clerical support, detracting from their 
ability to fully dedicate themselves to their courtroom strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned WordPerfect during the trial," said Bozanich, the 14-year veteran 
who tried the Menendez case. "I turned in a motion I typed myself and the judge 
exploded, so I learned spellcheck. . . . Our subpoenas were handwritten or 
typed by me." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin, the prosecutor in the McMartin case, said she had to conduct an 
18-month preliminary hearing without important transcripts of what her child 
witnesses said in videotaped interviews with social workers. The defense had 
prepared transcripts for itself and was challenging the interviewers for having 
coached the children. But Rubin said she was told by Garcetti, who was then 
chief deputy to Reiner, that the district attorney's office could not spare the 
funds to transcribe the videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti acknowledged that "we simply have not been giving our lawyers the 
support they need in terms of investigators, paralegals, law clerks, 
secretarial support, expert witnesses, whatever it is. . . . I want them to 
know it's going to be there." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Garcetti said, he wants to improve the training his trial deputies 
receive. He said the district attorney's office does a good job now, but could 
still be better. He said prosecutors get only three weeks of training when they 
join the office. After that, their only training comes at occasional half-day 
seminars on Saturdays. Attendance at these is voluntary. "I want formalized 
training," he said, even for prosecutors who have been with the office 15 or 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti refuses to discuss why his prosecutors have lost the high-publicity 
trials, saying: "I'm not going to talk about the cases in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Philibosian, who served as district attorney from 1982 to 1984, when he lost 
an election to Reiner, blamed what he termed Reiner's micromanagement style and 
inexperience as a felony prosecutor for most of the defeats. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiner had other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, in the "Twilight Zone" trial, he said, he inherited a difficult 
case because film director Landis was accused of negligent behavior in the 
deaths of the actors rather than an intentionally criminal act. The deaths 
occurred during the 1982 filming of "Twilight Zone -- The Movie," when a 
helicopter was struck by fireball from a special effects explosion and fell on 
the three victims. The issue was whether Landis could have foreseen and thus 
avoided the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Trial prosecutor Lea D'Agostino argued passionately that Landis should have 
stopped filming after troubles during rehearsal. But others said she was too 
passionate in portraying the director as a criminal in a case where his 
culpability, if any, was by omission. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Agostino responded: "It's very hard not to be intense when two tiny children 
have been murdered -- one decapitated -- and a good actor has also been 
decapitated and it looks like he's been through a blender." 
</P>
<P>
 The King case, Reiner said, was a tough sell because "ordinary citizens are 
reluctant to convict a police officer of a crime when he uses too much force to 
arrest a criminal, period." 
</P>
<P>
 King's beating at the hands of police was captured on videotape by a bystander 
and seen worldwide. But prosecutor White said he knew right away that "just 
because you have a video, doesn't mean you have a slam dunk case." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers and judges who watched portions of the trial on television said the 
defense did a masterful job of desensitizing the jury by repeatedly running the 
videotape at slow speed and calling experts to testify that King charged the 
officers and the officers acted appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say that the district attorney should have called its experts right 
away and called King as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
 But White said his hands were tied. He said three use-of-force experts agreed 
to testify for the prosecution, then backed out. King wasn't called because, in 
interviews, King denied speeding, drinking or leading officers on a chase that 
night -- in contravention of all other evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers were acquitted, touching off the worst urban riots in the United 
States during this century. Two of the officers were later convicted of federal 
civil rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Menendez case, because jurors could not agree on a verdict, the 
district attorney's office will get to try again. 
</P>
<P>
 For its upcoming effort, Garcetti has switched prosecutors, appointing a new 
team led by David Conn, a 15-year veteran who won convictions in the so-called 
"Cotton Club" murder of theater impresario Roy Radin. He also named Carol 
Najera, a nine-year veteran. Najera's appointment set off grumblings that the 
office might take another drubbing. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech to deputies a week ago, Garcetti exhorted them to "get behind" the 
new team. Then, in almost the next breath, he seemed aware of the worrying when 
he undercut Najera. 
</P>
<P>
 "David Conn," he said, "is the person assigned to the case. He will be 
handling 95% of the case. He asked for assistance. He asked that Carol (Najera) 
be assigned to the case. . . . I said, 'Yes, she will be a fine assistant for 
Dave.' "

U.S. MILITARY PRESENCE IN BOSNIA SEEN ON RISE; BALKANS: THERE ARE MORE THAN 
2,000 TROOPS IN LARGELY CLANDESTINE EFFORT. BUT THAT OFFICIAL NUMBER LIKELY IS 
LOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As dusk fell over a Serb-held slope overlooking this city, a U.S. Marine Corps 
officer poked among the hillside artillery nests to decide for himself whether, 
as U.N. officials were claiming, all rebel guns had been withdrawn in 
compliance with a NATO order. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days earlier, a U.S. Navy pilot passed through this Bosnian capital on a 
mission to scope out the effectiveness of the nightly U.S. humanitarian aid 
drops. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, at the height of a volatile standoff between U.N.-escorted relief 
workers and Bosnian Serb gunmen over access to the besieged enclave of 
Srebrenica, two U.S. Army officers were found to be deployed there when aid 
workers finally pushed their way in. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the official U.S. position holds that no American ground forces 
should be sent to Bosnia, escalating U.S. involvement in the conflict gripping 
this republic is bringing more and more American military personnel closer and 
closer to the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the largely clandestine U.S. role in aiding and monitoring Bosnia has 
not prevented the absence of significant U.S. ground troops from becoming a 
bone of contention with NATO allies. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Pentagon and at U.S. European Command headquarters in 
Stuttgart, Germany, acknowledge that 23 U.S. officers are assigned to posts in 
Bosnia, and the number of soldiers working elsewhere on operations directed at 
the former Yugoslav federation has soared to more than 2,000 over the last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the official figures seem grossly understated in comparison with the 
forces visible on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 On the last Saturday afternoon in February, an American reporter counted 30 
U.S. troops in the coffee shop at the Split, Croatia, airport, a transit point 
for U.N. operations in Bosnia and a relief staging area where European Command 
officials claim only 11 American cargo handlers are at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven U.S. Army officers were encountered on a single flight from Sarajevo to 
the Croatian capital of Zagreb in November, belying what was then a routine 
claim by Americans encountered in Bosnia that they were one of less than a 
handful of officers seconded from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 On the rural Bosnian roads traversed by aid convoys, outside the offices of 
Bosnian politicians and military kingpins involved in the conflict, and at U.N. 
listening posts around this republic that has been torn by ethnic strife for 
two years, U.S. forces are present nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-military Americans are also increasingly visible in Bosnia. One Western 
aid agency, in particular, hosts a number of purported American volunteers of 
middle age who have been spotted by journalists working in other capacities in 
other global hot spots, such as Central America, Afghanistan and the Middle 
East, presumably for military intelligence services or the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials here and American military sources in Washington concede that 
an unspecified number of Americans, presumably intelligence gatherers, have 
been traveling throughout Bosnia to provide the information needed by the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff to make decisions about future U.S. involvement in the Balkan 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 But NATO allies complain that U.S. policy, which often differs sharply from 
that of the Europeans, is being made in a vacuum because it does not have to 
take into account the consequences for U.N. troops already deployed here. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. military sources here are virtually unanimous in their opinion that 
American ground forces, as opposed to the eyes and ears currently deployed by 
Washington, should continue to stay out. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. ground presence in Bosnia is minimal in comparison to the contingents 
deployed by NATO allies France, Britain and Canada, which provide the bulk of 
the 12,000 U.N. troops now in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 But the token American presence is the guiding force for an ever-growing 
network of humanitarian and observation missions that U.S. officials argue has 
been a more effective form of intervention in the Bosnian conflict than the 
U.N. Protection Force approach of sending lightly armed peacekeepers into the 
midst of the fighting while giving them no authority to try to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine Lt. Col. Mitchell Triplett, the senior U.S. liaison officer at U.N. 
forward headquarters here, declined to discuss details of what Americans are 
doing in Bosnia, except to say they coordinate the U.S. roles in operations 
Provide Promise and Deny Flight. Provide Promise parachutes aid to isolated 
Bosnian communities; Deny Flight monitors compliance with the "no-fly" zone 
that the United Nations has imposed over Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief task of the U.N. mission in Bosnia has been to provide protection 
for humanitarian aid convoys struggling to make their way through ubiquitous 
war zones to bring food, medicine and other relief goods to the 2.7 million 
Bosnians dependent on outside help. That figure represents the vast majority of 
Bosnians still in this republic, where industries, farming and normal 
transportation routes have been destroyed by the 2-year-old war. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the aid never gets to its intended recipients, however, because gunmen 
impose roadblocks in efforts to starve out rival communities. 
</P>
<P>
 When the standoffs between U.N. forces and Bosnian Serb gunmen put the 
besieged Muslim communities of Srebrenica, Zepa and Gorazde at risk of 
widespread starvation a year ago, the U.S. military began nightly airdrops of 
aid to endangered enclaves as part of the Provide Promise mission. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. pilots also take part in the humanitarian airlift into Sarajevo that has 
been in operation since July, 1992, and has saved this city of 380,000 from 
starvation. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has 613 troops at Rhein-Main Air Base in Germany and 607 
more operating out of U.S. facilities in Italy working on the aid deliveries, 
said Cmdr. Ron Morse, public affairs officer at U.S. European Command 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Morse said 221 U.S. military personnel are assigned to a Mobile Army Surgical 
Hospital adjacent to Zagreb's airport, which has been providing medical care 
for injured troops of the 29,000-strong U.N. mission throughout the Balkans as 
well as for some Bosnian civilians evacuated for treatment abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional 310 U.S. troops are deployed in the former Yugoslav republic of 
Macedonia to serve as a tripwire against the further spread of the Balkan 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, Morse said, the United States has "a little over 2,000" military 
men and women assigned to missions in former Yugoslav republics or on 
humanitarian operations aimed at assisting Balkan war victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is why we get more than a little upset when the British and the French 
start accusing us of not pulling our weight," said a U.S. Army officer on 
temporary assignment here. "We're in this as much as they are, and we're not 
going to be bullied into a kind of involvement we don't think is particularly 
effective." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the officially acknowledged size of the U.S. role in the Balkans is given 
little publicity, possibly to avoid negative public reaction to involvement of 
Americans in an international humanitarian and peacekeeping mission that is 
quickly racking up record numbers of casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 80-plus deaths and more than 1,000 injuries sustained by U.N. 
Protection Force troops have been incurred in the Bosnia operation, although it 
accounts for less than half of the Balkan-wide mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeated calls by the U.N. Protection Force for more troops to carry out the 
Bosnia mission have been declined by the Clinton Administration, which has said 
American ground troops would be deployed only in the event that a peace 
agreement is worked out to the satisfaction of all three factions -- the 
Muslims, Serbs and Croats. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Muslim-led Bosnian government and ethnic Croatian separatists 
signed a U.S.-brokered agreement to form a federated state. 
</P>
<P>
 But with no comprehensive Bosnian peace accord in sight, discussions of U.S. 
ground forces remain hypothetical. The only point on which the American 
liaisons in Bosnia seem to agree is that the U.N. mission here has neither the 
means nor the marching orders to bring about peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I've seen in my brief time here has convinced me we made the right 
decision in staying out of this mess," said an Army officer seconded to the 
U.N. Protection Force. "There are no white hats here. This is a civil war and 
we don't have any business taking sides in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon and State Department officials in Washington acknowledge that the 
views of Bosnia-based Americans are often influenced by those of the U.N. or 
NATO agencies they most often have contact with, which in turn tend to be 
colored by the combatants they most often encounter. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials emphasize that they are aware of the potential for 
conflicting assessments and that they attempt to come up with a balanced 
picture on which to base decisions about further involvement.

CLINTON'S COUNSEL NUSSBAUM RESIGNS; STAFF: PRESIDENT ACCEPTS WHITE HOUSE 
LAWYER'S LETTER WITH 'DEEP REGRET' AS SEARCH BEGINS FOR SUCCESSOR. TALKS ON 
WHITEWATER-RELATED INQUIRY CAPPED SERIES OF POLITICAL GAFFES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum resigned Saturday, bringing to an end a 
yearlong tenure marked by controversy and accusations that his zealous advocacy 
of Bill Clinton's interests had compromised the President's political standing. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter released by the White House, Nussbaum defended his performance, 
saying his critics "do not understand, nor wish to understand, the role and 
obligations of a lawyer, even one acting as White House counsel." Because of 
that, he wrote to Clinton, "I now believe I can best serve you by returning to 
private life." 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum said he will stay on the job through April 5 to allow time for 
selection of a successor. 
</P>
<P>
 The departure of the 57-year-old former New York litigator was precipitated by 
the controversy surrounding the Clinton Administration's handling of questions 
related to the Whitewater land deal in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Friday, Nussbaum and eight other Administration officials were subpoenaed 
at Whitewater special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr.'s request regarding White 
House contacts with Treasury Department officials about their investigation 
into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the week, it had been revealed that Nussbaum and other White House 
staff members met with Treasury Department officials last fall to discuss the 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials and associates of the Clintons already have begun a 
search for Nussbaum's replacement. Among those believed to be under 
consideration is James Hamilton, a Washington attorney who represents the 
family of Vincent Foster, the White House deputy counsel who died in an 
apparent suicide last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Klein, who followed Foster as deputy counsel, has assumed many of 
Nussbaum's duties for now, particularly those involving oversight of White 
House relations with the Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter accepting Nussbaum's resignation with "deep regret," Clinton 
praised his aide, complimenting him for his role in helping select Supreme 
Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, FBI Director Louis J. 
Freeh and the more than 60 judicial nominations the Administration has made so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
 "During your tenure, this Administration named the highest percentage of women 
and minorities to the federal judiciary in history," Clinton wrote. "These 
judges and justices will leave a lasting imprint on our case law, and their 
places on the federal bench will be clear and abiding signs of encouragement to 
those long excluded from administering our system of justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are pioneers, and yours was the lamp that lit their way." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Clinton's warm words, many officials within the White House have long 
believed that Nussbaum's definition of his job clashed with the culture of 
Washington in a way that frequently created more problems for the 
Administration than it resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The triggering incident for Nussbaum's resignation was the storm of criticism 
that broke last week over meetings he attended in which White House aides 
discussed aspects of the Whitewater investigation with officials of the 
Treasury Department, which is investigating a defunct savings and loan once 
owned by former Clinton associate James B. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal was the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater real estate deal, and one 
of the prime questions in the continuing investigation of the matter is whether 
money from McDougal's savings and loan was used in any way to benefit then-Gov. 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The meetings between White House and Treasury Department aides, critics 
charged, could have been used by the White House to try to interfere with the 
ongoing investigation by a Treasury division known as the Resolution Trust 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants in the meetings deny any such motive, asserting that the sessions 
were innocent. But even Clinton has conceded they raise a problem of 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 And that, in a nutshell, was much of Nussbaum's problem. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city where political appearance can assume greater importance than 
underlying substance, Nussbaum frequently seemed heedless of both politics and 
appearances, pursuing his client's rights with a fixed determination to uphold 
them to the fullest, regardless of cost. 
</P>
<P>
 That determination became most apparent after the death of Foster, when 
Nussbaum forbade police investigators to examine papers in Foster's office 
until he had sorted them and made his own determination of what was relevant 
and what was not. 
</P>
<P>
 That procedure, while legally sound, raised suspicions among Clinton's critics 
that Nussbaum was trying to hide something -- suspicions that deepened months 
later when reporters discovered that among the papers Nussbaum did not turn 
over to police were some relating to the Whitewater matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Those papers were subsequently subpoenaed and turned over to Fiske, who is 
investigating the real estate affair and has indicated his intention to also 
examine the circumstances of Foster's death. 
</P>
<P>
 At other times, Nussbaum's disregard of political realities had less to do 
with his legal judgment. The prime case in point involved the appointment of C. 
Lani Guinier to head the Justice Department's civil rights office. Nussbaum had 
responsibility for reviewing Guinier's writings -- including some controversial 
ideas on voting rights -- but failed to realize the political storm they would 
cause and did not bring them to Clinton's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was a political disaster in which Clinton, eventually, had to 
abandon his old friend's nomination, alienating both her and many of his black 
supporters.

TIJUANA SHOOTOUT A CLASH OF DRUG AGENTS, POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bloody shootout that killed a Mexican federal police commander and two state 
police officers erupted when federal police confronted state judicial police 
who were protecting drug traffickers, Mexican authorities confirmed Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun battle Thursday night pitted officers of the Baja California State 
Judicial Police against agents of a special federal squad from Mexico City 
investigating the powerful Arellano cartel of Tijuana, whose three leaders are 
wanted in the death of the cardinal of Guadalajara, U.S. and Mexican sources 
said. The FBI and the DEA joined forces with the Mexican Federal Judicial 
Police Saturday in a wide-ranging, fast-moving investigation on both sides of 
the border. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is speculation that the Arellanos were in the area -- at least one of 
the Arellanos," William Esposito, the special agent in charge of the FBI in San 
Diego, said after a meeting with the deputy attorney general of Mexico in 
Tijuana on Saturday. "There is information that they have been going back and 
forth between Baja California Norte, other parts of Mexico and possibly the 
southwestern U.S." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators suspect that one of the three wanted kingpins, Ramon Arellano, 
may have been riding in a red Chevrolet Suburban that was stopped by two 
Suburbans carrying the federal officers Thursday night, setting off a 
desperate, close-quarters gunfight with heavy weapons at a busy intersection, 
according to a high-ranking U.S. source close to the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. agents are looking into the possibility that Arellano fled north across 
the border after the shootout, sources said. Arellano and his two brothers have 
been on the run since the May 24 shooting that killed Cardinal Juan Jesus 
Posadas Ocampo and six others at the Guadalajara airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "The DEA and FBI are putting together a special team to gather intelligence on 
the U.S. side," Esposito said. "We are working on the border trying to do a 
follow-up investigation on the Arellanos." 
</P>
<P>
 Although hard evidence of the Arellanos' involvement did not emerge Saturday, 
Mexican federal officials provided new details of the investigation that is 
focusing on suspected high-level corruption in Baja California law enforcement. 
They confirmed that the federal officers were attacked by state judicial police 
officers in league with drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The red Suburban was carrying the attacking group, including state judicial 
police officers," said Hugo Morales, a spokesman for the Mexican attorney 
general's office. "The federal agents were attacked. That is one of the 
conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
 Reinforcements consisting of more than 100 federal officers and top 
prosecutors from Mexico City arrived in Tijuana late Friday and early Saturday, 
underscoring the gravity of the case. They were led by Mexican Atty. Gen. Diego 
Valades, who met with Baja California Gov. Ernesto Ruffo Appel, and returned to 
the capital after announcing that the results of the shooting investigation 
would be made public Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, Mexican officials said Saturday the federal unit had been 
investigating the Arellanos, who they said appear to be connected to the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a fundamental question: Who was being protected?" a Mexican official 
said. "It had to be a very important personage." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials Saturday identified the four men who died: Cmdr. Alejandro 
Castaneda Andrade, chief of the special federal squad; Alfredo Mendizibil 
Rodriguez and Salvador Miramontes Torres, both state police officers suspected 
of involvement with drug traffickers; and Juan Manuel Chavez, also believed to 
have been allied with the state officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Two federal police officers and two other unidentified participants remain 
hospitalized with multiple gunshot wounds. Authorities revealed that four more 
suspects arrested at the scene include at least one additional state police 
officer, Gustavo Aguilar Villasenor. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunfight took place about 8:45 p.m. Thursday. The federal agents riding in 
two Suburbans tried to arrest the occupants of the red Suburban on Felix Gomez 
Street, a narrow side street near Boulevard Diaz Ordaz, a crowded commercial 
thoroughfare, according to a U.S. source. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commander's vehicle was parallel to the red van," the U.S. source said. 
"They tried to stop them." 
</P>
<P>
 The occupants of the red van opened fire, shooting out the windows of their 
own vehicle, officials said. The federal officers returned fire and wounded 
several suspects. As the federal officers tried to take their assailants into 
custody, officials said, another vehicle came by carrying allies of the 
traffickers and state police officers; the gunmen jumped out and shot at the 
federal officers with AK-47s and other weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guns blazing, they start shooting at the (federal police), who have got the 
guys on the ground," the U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of shots were fired in the ensuing exchange that mortally wounded 
Cmdr. Castaneda, officials said. Screaming passersby ran for cover. Bullets 
peppered storefronts and vehicles. At least one occupant of the red Suburban -- 
U.S. sources said he is believed to have been Ramon Arellano -- made his 
getaway in the second vehicle. Dozens of federal, state and municipal police 
officers converged on the chaotic scene and Bishop Carlos Emilio Berlie of 
Tijuana, who happened to be walking nearby, administered the last rites to the 
dead and dying. 
</P>
<P>
 The cartel headed by the three Arellanos brothers has allegedly conducted a 
bloody turf war resulting in numerous murders and brazen shootouts in Tijuana, 
other Mexican cities and the San Diego area during the past several years. 
Mexican officials say an Arellano assassination squad, led by Ramon, killed 
Cardinal Posadas by mistake while gunning for a rival drug lord, Joaquin 
(Chapo) Guzman, at the Guadalajara airport. 
</P>
<P>
 A sweeping investigation during the past nine months resulted in the arrest of 
eight San Diego gang members accused of being Arellano triggermen and of a 
fourth Arellano brother not directly suspected in the cardinal's murder. 
Authorities have confiscated millions of dollars worth of cartel properties and 
arrested or fired numerous police officers suspected of collusion with 
traffickers. That investigation has been led by secretive federal units, such 
as the one commanded by Castaneda, dispatched periodically to Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 But the failure to arrest the three wanted Arellano brothers has fed lingering 
suspicions about the official version of the case. The press and human rights 
activists in Tijuana have insisted during past months that the fugitives have 
been sheltered in the border city by corrupt law enforcement allies.

RIGHTISTS REJECT PARTICIPATION IN S. AFRICA VOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the latest dip of this country's political roller coaster, militant leaders 
of the far right Saturday overwhelmingly rejected a last-ditch plan to 
participate in next month's elections and warned again of civil war if they are 
not granted an independent white homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, retired Gen. Constand Viljoen, the most moderate leader of a 
white separatists' coalition called the Afrikaner Volksfront, announced that he 
will honor the right-wing boycott of the country's first all-race elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Viljoen had unexpectedly registered a hastily formed political party, the 
Freedom Front, shortly before a Friday midnight deadline for the election 
expired. But he backed down Saturday afternoon in the face of fierce opposition 
by pro-apartheid Volksfront leaders during a stormy, closed-door session here. 
</P>
<P>
 A grim-faced Viljoen told reporters later that he will not submit a list of 
the party's candidates by Wednesday, as the law requires for the party to be 
listed on the final ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will do nothing," Viljoen said. The Freedom Front's registration "will just 
lapse." He added, "This is the wish of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferdi Hartzenberg, the fiery president of the pro-apartheid Conservative 
Party, first announced the decision to continue the election boycott to about 
150 right-wingers who had gathered in a Dutch Reform Church hall here. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we took part in the election, we would lend it legitimacy," he said to 
cheers and applause. "We would just be endorsing the oppression of our people, 
and that would be unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 The Volksfront claims to represent the nation's 3 million Afrikaners, 
descendants of 17th-Century, mostly Dutch settlers. But polls have shown their 
support is far smaller and shrinking steadily as neo-Nazi and other openly 
racist zealots push the fractious organization further from the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the sharp repudiation of Viljoen's pro-election maneuver dashed a surge 
of hopes and headlines that right-wingers would drop their opposition to a 
democratic vote and a peaceful transition to black majority rule. 
</P>
<P>
 It also appeared to split the Freedom Alliance open, because the 
right-wingers' chief black ally, Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's 
Inkatha Freedom Party, registered for the election Friday. Buthelezi said, 
however, that his participation in the campaign is contingent on using 
international mediation to forge a solution to Inkatha's demand that the 
constitution be rewritten to provide far greater autonomy for Zulus in Natal 
province. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson Mandela, head of the African National Congress and expected to be the 
first black president, said Saturday that he is prepared to accept mediation by 
the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity, the Commonwealth or 
another international body. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the organizations that must be entrusted with the task of 
international mediation," he said. Polls show the ANC is likely to sweep the 
April 26-28 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela's chief rival, President Frederik W. de Klerk's National Party, stands 
to gain by the renewed right-wing boycott, because polls suggest many 
Afrikaners will seek a chance to vote against the ANC. But at least one of 
Viljoen's supporters, retired Gen. Tienie Groenewald, said Buthelezi may also 
benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 The daylong meeting of the Volksfront's so-called Boer Parliament, which 
defiant right-wingers created in January as an ostensible governing body for 
Afrikaners until they are granted a homeland, was also supposed to finally 
choose the boundaries of the territory the separatists hope to occupy. 
</P>
<P>
 The map was not released, but the hard-liners apparently won that debate as 
well. Despite the fact that whites are not in a majority in any part of the 
country, the Volksfront plan reportedly calls for annexing more than one-third 
of South Africa's territory for a self-ruled, whites-only state. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed map includes the Transvaal, Orange Free State and a slice of 
Natal province. The land, which includes the administrative capital of 
Pretoria, corresponds to the Boer republics that were conquered and colonized 
by the British in 1902 after the second Boer War. 
</P>
<P>
 It is almost inconceivable that such a state could be created. Both Mandela 
and De Klerk have repeatedly said they would oppose the division of the 
post-apartheid nation into ethnic or racial territories. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Afrikaners who attended the Saturday session, however, warned that 
they would go to war rather than submit to an ANC-led government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must fight them," said a 64-year-old, white-haired woman wearing pearls 
and a necklace emblazoned with the swastika-like symbol of the Afrikaner 
Resistance Front, the best-known of the pro-apartheid groups. "You sign your 
own death warrant if you come under them. They don't understand democracy the 
way we do."

CHINA TRIES TO PUT BEST FACE ON HUMAN RIGHTS 'REFORMS'; DISSIDENTS: IN RARE 
VISIT TO FORCED LABOR CAMP, 5 U.S. REPORTERS SEE -- BUT CAN'T TALK TO -- MOST 
FAMOUS PRISONER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hoping to impress their foreign guests with the benevolence of their 
institution, officials at the Lingyuan No. 2 Labor Reform Detachment began by 
showing a videotape that described the sprawling forced labor camp as a "happy 
land for the reforming of new men." 
</P>
<P>
 But, mid-video, just after a lingering close-up of a velvety red rose 
supposedly grown in the prison garden, Warden Xin Tingquan, who had been acting 
nervously, jumped to his feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Herding his American guests, five China-based news correspondents, to a 
tinted, one-way window overlooking the main prison courtyard, Xin blurted: 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Liu Gang will be walking by now." 
</P>
<P>
 And indeed, there he was, Lingyuan No. 2 Labor Reform Detachment's most famous 
political prisoner, Liu Gang, 32, wearing a quilted blue jacket, walking slowly 
and talking with a prison guard on the path just below the window.  
</P>
<P>
 Arrested in 1989 in the wake of the Tian An Men Square crackdown, Liu was an 
important student leader in the democracy movement before it was crushed by 
People's Liberation Army troops. His six-year sentence, and subsequent reports 
that he was tortured in prison by Chinese authorities, made him a focal point 
of international human rights complaints against the Chinese government. 
</P>
<P>
 By permitting the American reporters to visit the prison, a rare peek inside 
one of 684 "reform-through-labor" camps in the vast Chinese gulag, the Beijing 
government hoped to demonstrate a new openness and responsiveness to human 
rights concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's carefully choreographed prison visit was timed exactly one week 
before U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's planned visit to China. 
</P>
<P>
 But the prison officials refused the reporters' repeated requests to interview 
Liu in person. At first, the officials said the interview was prohibited by 
prison rules. Later, they said the interview was not granted because "Liu Gang 
has a habit of not telling the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, they were afraid of what the former physics graduate student might 
say to the reporters. But without the direct interview, it was impossible to 
ascertain the prisoner's state of health or evaluate his treatment in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The unprecedented tour of the infamous prison camp came as police across the 
country were rounding up other dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them was China's leading dissident, Wei Jingsheng, who was detained for 
24 hours before being released Saturday. The detention was apparently 
punishment for Wei's meeting last week in Beijing with U.S. State Department 
human rights official John Shattuck. 
</P>
<P>
 Wei's detention and the arrest or detention of at least seven other dissidents 
in recent days sparked a sharp negative reaction from President Clinton and 
cast a dark cloud over the upcoming visit by Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
 In an executive order signed by Clinton, the United States has threatened to 
withdraw low-tariff "most-favored-nation" trading status from China unless 
Beijing demonstrates "significant, overall progress" on human rights questions 
before June. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can be sure that human rights will be right at the top of my agenda when 
I get to Beijing," Christopher said Saturday in Honolulu, where he began his 
Asia tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the recent series of arrests and detentions, the Christopher visit was 
viewed by both sides as an opportunity to iron out remaining differences 
between the two countries. On his recent visit here, human rights envoy 
Shattuck said agreement was close at hand on several key human rights concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Chinese authorities are sending mixed signals to the Americans about 
their willingness to cooperate on human rights, it may be because two arms of 
the Chinese government, each with its own political leaning, are pulling in 
opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent crackdown on dissidents, for example, was conducted by the Public 
Security Bureau, the hard-line police agency in charge of maintaining public 
order. Although the timing this year is particularly sensitive because of the 
Christopher visit, the Public Security Bureau often conducts roundups of 
dissident political activists in advance of sessions of the National People's 
Congress, like the one scheduled to begin next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a more conciliatory tone has been struck by the State Council, the 
highest organ of state administration, headed by Chinese Premier Li Peng. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the press office of the State Council showed a group of American 
reporters videotapes taken in jail of Liu and three other men -- Chen Ziming, 
Wang Juntao and Ren Wanding -- who head the political prisoner lists of most 
human rights groups. The videotapes showed the dissident leaders celebrating 
the Chinese New Year with their families in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, here in a remote region of Liaoning province, 160 miles northeast 
of Beijing, the State Council granted reporters' requests to visit one of the 
most notorious prisons in the Chinese system. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1958, the Lingyuan penal colony consists of six factory work camps 
scattered in the barren foothills of what was once a Mongol nationality 
minority area. 
</P>
<P>
 The five reporters, representing the Los Angeles Times, New York Times, Wall 
Street Journal, Associated Press and U.S. News & World Report, were taken to 
only one of the units, the No. 2 Labor Reform Detachment located about four 
miles from the center of Lingyuan. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the prison has 2,432 inmates and a staff of 630. All of the 
inmates are required to work without pay at least eight hours a day and attend 
political indoctrination classes three days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the six penal units in Lingyuan functions as a factory with the 
inmates as employees. The main work at the No. 2 detachment is assembly of 5- 
to 6-ton trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that last year the prison produced 3,500 trucks, generating a 
revenue of $30 million. Last year, they said, the prison truck-assembly plant 
earned about $900,000 profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the fact that it is bordered by high walls topped with 370-volt 
electric fencing and surrounded by guards armed with electric cattle prods, the 
prison very much resembles any other large Chinese factory compound, complete 
with working and living facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The prison grounds were mostly cleared of inmates when the reporters visited. 
No prisoners could be interviewed outside the presence of prison officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The reporters were given a tour of a residential dormitory. The floors were 
polished, the bed linens all neatly folded and pressed. The entrances of the 
dormitory were festooned with New Year's decorations that prison officials 
insisted had not been put up just for the visit. 
</P>
<P>
 On the hallway wall opposite each room was a "point chart" listing the name of 
each inmate. Inmates can lower their sentences through good behavior, the 
guards explained. 
</P>
<P>
 But under the Chinese system, which places a heavy emphasis on confession, no 
points can be granted unless the inmate first acknowledges his crime. This is 
something that Liu has so far refused to do. 
</P>
<P>
 The reporters were guided across a recreational courtyard rigged with a 
volleyball net and through a political study classroom that had the slogan 
"Study Hard and Accelerate the Reform Process" above the blackboard. Outside, 
large pigs grunted in the prison swine farm. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most surreal scene of the tour, inside the prison recreational hall 
theater, a musical group calling itself "New Road Song & Dance Troupe" 
moon-walked and jerked to a scratchy recording of Michael Jackson's "Bad." 
Later, a horn ensemble attempted a version of "Memories" from the musical 
"Cats." 
</P>
<P>
 After a tour of the main assembly line, empty except for a few inmate-workers, 
the reporters were taken to the prison museum. Adorning the walls were pictures 
of some of the prison truck models, award certificates from the national prison 
system and photos of famous prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Prominent among the inmate pictures was a photo of Liu and his two prison 
cellmates, also charged with "counterrevolutionary crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 The photo had obviously been added to the display only recently. But it 
underscored the prison administration's preoccupation with unrepentant prisoner 
Liu, who in 1991 led an inmate hunger strike to protest conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials showed several videotapes of Liu playing Ping-Pong, pocket 
billiards and volleyball. They also showed what they said was a remote camera 
view of Liu talking with a guard in another room of the prison. 
</P>
<P>
 In the remote-camera view, Liu appeared to have a red rash on his face, but 
prison officials said it was merely acne. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials, who film many of Liu's activities in prison, talk about his 
sports skills -- "He is better at volleyball than he is at Ping-Pong" -- 
monitor what he is reading and count how many cigarettes he smokes each day. 
</P>
<P>
 They even seem proud of his eating habits. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a healthy attitude. See how fat he is?"

RARE SPIRIT OF COOPERATION STREAMLINES I-5 CRASH SUITS; COURTS: LAWYERS FOR 
PLAINTIFFS AND DEFENSE ARE COLLABORATING TO KEEP WORST U.S. HIGHWAY ACCIDENT 
FROM BECOMING A LEGAL PILEUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK ARAX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Thanksgiving weekend in 1991 a dust storm blew through fallow cotton fields 
west of here and engulfed Interstate 5, triggering a midday pileup that killed 
17 people and injured 151, a scene of charred bodies and scorched metal that 
rescue workers compared to war. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the massive legal case generated by the worst highway accident in U.S. 
history is wending its way through Fresno County Superior Court, a procession 
of 99 plaintiffs, 174 defendants, 104 attorneys and 46,822 documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The state of California has agreed to pay $3.4 million, one of the largest 
such awards, to one woman who nearly burned to death trying to save her husband 
and two small children from a fireball that consumed them. Still, a case so 
ponderous remains that the judge and many of the attorneys hope it will never 
see the light of trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're talking about a case that could tie up that courthouse for the better 
part of a decade," said Darryl Doke, the deputy attorney general handling the 
36 claims against the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a quagmire," said Burlingame attorney Frank Pitre, who is 
representing the family of one of the deceased. 
</P>
<P>
 So attorneys on both sides have done something attorneys are not wont to do. 
They have reined in their egos and visions of multimillion-dollar judgments and 
agreed to streamline the case so that mediation might work. 
</P>
<P>
 Their willingness to limit paperwork and depositions has saved insurance 
carriers and taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars and will probably put 
more money in the pockets of victims. Indeed, they have acted so downright 
civilly that the judge in the case expects a "global" mediation settlement 
within the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cooperation by all the attorneys has been remarkable," Superior Court 
Judge Stephen Henry said. "There are no ambulance-chasers in this. Just the 
opposite." 
</P>
<P>
 It would be nice if the case offered a magic system that could be shipped to 
other courts that are besieged by complex litigation. But both sides agree that 
the same method could be tried with a different set of attorneys and the case 
would drag on for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Mediation has a good chance of working here, they say, because everyone 
recognizes the imponderables posed by the case -- questions better left out of 
a courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Who, for instance, is to blame? Is a dust storm an act of God? What about the 
farmers whose land abuts the freeway? Can you hold them responsible for the dry 
conditions of their land -- conditions that clearly fueled the storm -- even 
though they faced a fifth year of drought? And then there are the individual 
drivers, many of whom were going too fast for the conditions. In an 
accordion-like reaction, can one driver blame another driver two miles up the 
road? In other words, how do you establish cause? 
</P>
<P>
 It takes little wind to whip up the tumbleweeds and dust when the earth is 
parched on the San Joaquin Valley's west side. That Friday, along the main 
artery linking Southern and Northern California, the gusts ranged from 15 
m.p.h. to 40 m.p.h. -- some of the worst winds ever recorded in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so dark, so dirty, so dusty, that we had even lost sight of the wiper 
blades on our windshield," one survivor said. "We couldn't see." 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue workers compared the two-mile column of 164 cars and big-rig trucks to 
the remains of Iraqi armored vehicles destroyed by American bombers during the 
Gulf War. A state task force blamed drivers' high speed for the tragedy and 
found that authorities had acted properly in not closing the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine months later, the lawsuits began pouring in. Judge Henry was given the 
job of coordinating the pretrial process, and one of his first tasks was to 
look back at the complex litigation growing out of the 1980 MGM Grand fire in 
Las Vegas and the 1987 Dupont Plaza Hotel fire in San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the attorneys in the traffic crash case had represented clients in one 
or both of the earlier fires and met with Henry on how to structure the case. 
They decided to assign two steering committees -- one plaintiff, one defense -- 
to oversee the discovery phase. 
</P>
<P>
 "In MGM, the plaintiffs seized control of the case and buried the defense in 
paper," said Fresno attorney Stephen Cornwell, chairman of the defense 
committee. "I wanted to make sure that a lot of useless depositions weren't 
taken just for the sake of scaring the insurance carriers into settling for big 
sums." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides agreed to consolidate the case, in effect treating it as one huge 
litigation. They established a depository at a local court reporting firm where 
all documents were filed. Instead of copying and mailing a 30-page document to 
every attorney in the case -- half of whom wouldn't be interested anyway -- the 
depository sent a one-page index informing them that the document was 
available. This alone cut the paperwork by more than half. 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce travel costs, depositions were held at one location in Fresno. Each 
victim or witness could only be deposed once so all interested attorneys had to 
be present. Written and oral questions were kept to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want people responding to 150 of the same sets of questions," said 
Rick Watters, the Fresno attorney for the woman who got the $3.4-million 
settlement. "Of course, these are attorneys and we like to ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the rookies, in particular, felt that to impress their bosses they 
had to be heard, even if that exact question had been already posed and 
answered. But it never got out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than sue a driver two miles up the road, Judge Henry ruled that each 
party could only bring action against those drivers who ended up clustered in 
the same accident pod. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the paring down, big cases like the I-5 pileup can be a window into 
people's ingenuity, attorneys say. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, for instance, the young Santa Rosa woman who says a small facial 
scar suffered during the crash ruined her plans to move to Los Angeles and 
become a movie star. And the Spanish balladeer famous from Mexicali to Delano 
who says the dust in his throat and an injured back cost him tens of thousands 
of dollars in missed engagements. And the Modesto woman who says she was 
knocked unconscious during the crash and when she awoke she didn't know the 
husband next to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would you give us your full name, please," she was asked during her 
deposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say it's Gracie B. Smith." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said she couldn't recall her age, marriage, son or certain words in the 
newspaper. But she did remember the vivid details of the accident, of holding 
her parrot, Honey Birdy, and seeing the driver behind them who bore an uncanny 
resemblance to her brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have bits and pieces . . . ," she explained to a defense attorney who 
doubted her memory loss and back injuries. "I mean I just can't remember. . . . 
I just make up stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no disputing what grief that wind brought to 31-year-old Dora Smith, 
whose case is the only one settled so far. The Paso Robles woman was riding in 
the car with her husband and two children when it crashed in the blinding dust. 
She suffered second-, third- and fourth-degree burns to her face and half her 
body as she tried futilely to save them. In a deposition, she testified that 
the last thing she remembers before their 1980 Monza blew up was her 4-year-old 
son Christopher screaming: "Mommy, Mommy, it hurts. Mommy, Mommy, it burns." 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorney, Watters, argues that the state should have closed I-5, which it 
did during a dust storm a month later. Short of that, he argues, Caltrans 
should have placed electronic signs along the roadway warning of high winds and 
dust storms and advising drivers to slow down or pull over. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strongest argument Rick Watters had was his client, Dora Smith," said 
Doke of the state attorney general's office. "I've been in this business 22 
years and nothing could compare to her physical and emotional suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was my responsibility to the public to make sure this case was 
never presented to a jury." 
</P>
<P>
 Retired Superior Court Judge Eugene Krum has been mediating the case since 
September. He said he expects to settle all the claims in the next three 
months, with the exception of Smith's post-collision fire lawsuit against 
General Motors and perhaps a few others. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say Krum will ask the defense side to put up $12 million in a "global" 
settlement. Defense attorneys will probably try to negotiate down to $8 
million. If they succeed, a plaintiff whose claim was valued at $100,000 by 
Krum will receive $66,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a settlement has the added attraction of avoiding such sticky questions 
as what liability, if any, farmers carry for the dust storm. Neither side 
admits fault in mediation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a story that belies the public's perception of the legal profession," 
Krum said. "From the very beginning, lawyers on both sides realized the 
horrendous mess if they didn't cooperate and hold costs down. They have showed 
a great devotion to their clients and the public."

CAMPAIGN JOURNAL; A TALE OF 2 HOUSES: HUFFINGTON RETURNS TO HIS HUMBLE ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Huffington is driving a rented white Lincoln Continental through his 
old neighborhood, talking about one of the chores he used to do as a kid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we washed the dishes and I think we dried the dishes, if I can recall 
going back 30 years," says the Santa Barbara congressman. "I remember mowing 
the lawn, that was my chore. But it wasn't a chore, it was fun as a kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington swings the car left onto Evergreen Street and parks near 5415, a 
three-bedroom, ranch-style home in this Houston suburb with a one-car garage 
and a towering pecan tree in the front yard. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the house he wants California to see. It is the house where he grew up 
and the one he is showing in television commercials aired throughout the state 
as part of his campaign to win the Republican U.S. Senate nomination in June in 
order to challenge Democratic incumbent Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate hopes this simple home will convey his average American roots 
and reassure voters that he can still understand their lives even though he is 
now enormously rich. He also hopes it will counter the images he expects his 
opponents to use in the campaign, such as the house he lives in now. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the house he doesn't want California to see. Huffington says reporters 
will not be allowed into the $4-million mansion he bought in the hills above 
Santa Barbara because he believes it may be offensive to some people who don't 
share his financial success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to separate myself from that house," says Huffington, 46, whose 
family-run oil company became successful when he was a teen-ager. "But I'm 
saying I am human, just like everybody else. . . . I don't flaunt anything I 
have and I never will. Why would you ever show something like that?" 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a small issue for Huffington. He views himself as a populist who 
is trying to appeal across income, party and ethnic boundaries. But the rap on 
Huffington when he paid more than $5 million of his own money to win a 
congressional office in 1992 was that he is an inexperienced aristocrat seeking 
to buy high office. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate's answer is always to cite his middle-class youth. So when he 
was pressed on the issue recently by a reporter, he suggested a guided tour of 
his boyhood neighborhood to help understand his character as well as his 
political inspirations. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not a traditional campaign event. There was no news release. No staff. 
No organized schedule. No speech. Just the candidate, dressed casually in a 
striped polo shirt and black cotton pants, driving the rented Lincoln with its 
climate control set at 67 degrees, at times triggering the air conditioner even 
though it was about the same temperature outside. 
</P>
<P>
 When he stepped out of the car on Evergreen Street, the tour was a narration 
of little-boy stories that sounded so plain and cute they could have come from 
one of his favorite television shows of the time: "Leave It to Beaver." 
</P>
<P>
 This bedroom window is where he used to hang his feet out while he slept on 
the stiflingly hot and humid summer nights. Out front is where he ran a 
lemonade stand. That huge oak tree was just a sapling then and its branches 
made good bows and arrows. For one birthday, his father borrowed a pony to ride 
in the back yard. And in the summer, the neighborhood youngsters gathered in 
the street each evening to chase the "fog machine," which was really a 
pesticide spray to keep the mosquitoes down. 
</P>
<P>
 The block had plenty of children, including one boy named Larry who got him 
into some mischief. "I didn't do it, but I was there when he fried a frog," he 
says. "All these years later, I feel so guilty about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington confesses that he was a 1950s "couch potato," watching television 
so much that he eventually needed pliers to change the channel because the 
handle broke off. His other favorite hangout was the Bellaire Movie Theater. 
Third was the YMCA swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the car, Huffington's narration evolves into a political analysis. 
Bellaire, in many ways, is a metaphor for the problems facing America, he says. 
It is still a nice community, he says, but its residents have to struggle 
harder for the same standard of living his family enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-income parents cannot provide the supervision or support that children 
need, he says. Children worry about crime in their neighborhoods and at school. 
And television shows like "Leave It to Beaver" have turned into stories that 
celebrate violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can remember a lot of TV shows we saw when we were younger as if they were 
yesterday -- it's imprinted, I can see it right in my mind," he says. "Well, if 
they have this stuff imprinted when they're 11 years old, good God, no wonder 
some of these kids are going off in the wrong direction." 
</P>
<P>
 What has changed for middle-income families since his 1950s youth, Huffington 
says, is the financial burden they are forced to pay to a wasteful federal 
bureaucracy. If government economic policy was working, he says, families would 
have more time for each other, leading to less crime and a better opportunity 
for youth to learn social values. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I ever had a negative experience here, except for that frog," 
he says. "I just feel good about having grown up here because this was a good 
solid place."

ON CALIFORNIA: IS THERE A DOC IN THE HOUSE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They come with their pilot programs, acronyms and sound bites, promoting 
vouchers, or taxes, teacher power, principal power, more computers, fewer 
tests, secession, prayer, metal detectors. California is bursting with public 
school reformers -- most long on theory, short on practical experience and, 
more to the point, tangible successes. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to Floyd Buchanan. He is 70 years old, a grandfather of eight. 
He lives by a golf course in semi-retirement, but when talk turns to schools 
the eyes behind the trifocals still burn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Education," Buchanan says, sitting in a home office cluttered with plaques 
and mementos, "has always been a mission for me, just as if I had gone into the 
ministry, or became a doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 Buchanan, in fact, is known to this town outside Fresno simply as "Doc," a 
reference to his UC Berkeley education. He moved here in the late 1950s. Clovis 
was just a cow town then, with a reputation for tough cops, good rodeo, card 
rooms and little else. Today, it's a boom town of 50,000. Most of the new 
residents come from Fresno, drawn in large measure by Floyd Buchanan's 
handiwork -- the public school system. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Buchanan served as superintendent of the Clovis Unified School District for 
three decades. He built the district from nothing, putting into practice what 
were considered, then, some pretty strange theories. For instance: basics. "My 
position," Buchanan says, "was that if kids couldn't read, couldn't do basic 
math, couldn't write, then all the other grandiose things educators had in mind 
for them wouldn't happen." And empowerment: "Leadership is vision and support. 
You point to the top of the mountain, and tell your teachers and staff: 'That's 
where we want to go,' and then you get on your knees and say: 'How can we help 
you get there?' " 
</P>
<P>
 He marshaled resources, bought the best equipment, built the fanciest schools 
-- and expected results: "Administration," he says, "is the art of removing the 
excuses." He unlocked playgrounds and promoted parent involvement, bonding 
schools to community. He installed dress codes and aggressive anti-truancy and 
maintenance programs. Graffiti vandals who targeted Clovis schools found their 
mischief painted over by morning, which sort of took the sport out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 And he unleashed an educational philosophy, applying the dynamics of athletics 
to academics. As coaches motivate, Buchanan believes, so should teachers. As 
football heroes become campus heroes, so should the champions of math quizzes, 
spelling bees, choral clubs. As score is kept in sports contests, so should it 
be kept in class. In Clovis, competition became king. Students competed with 
themselves, classmates, other schools. There was pressure to win -- but also to 
learn from the losing. 
</P>
<P>
 "In education," Buchanan says, "we should teach kids what to do when they 
lose, to get off their duffs and get back in the fight. If we can teach them 
not to be quitters by the time they finish the 12th grade, they should make it 
through life just fine." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By any measurement, the package worked. Amid a tax rebellion, Clovis voters 
approved school bonds. Test scores and real estate values floated upward, 
together. As new people poured into Clovis, however, so did new ideas -- about 
competition, about "Doc." And three years ago, Buchanan was put to pasture. 
What has followed since has been a pathetic series of power struggles and 
purges, scandals and back-room politics, much of it orchestrated by Buchanan 
himself. Doc, people whisper, just doesn't know how to let go. Can anyone blame 
him? 
</P>
<P>
 On this day Buchanan seems unsure what to do with himself. He talks of writing 
a book. He talks of running for a county schools post. He talks for hours about 
his ideas and programs, of creating "lighthouses" and salvaging California 
schools: "Instead of becoming overwhelmed, you get a little toehold somewhere, 
and you fight back." He tells stories. Once a teacher challenged his decree 
that 90% of the students should test at grade level. Let's see you do it, the 
teacher said. So he spent four months in her classroom; the scores doubled. 
"Give me a classroom today," he says, "and I could do it again."

 The eyes burn anew as he suggests this, but most likely Buchanan's legacy must 
remain as written, which, after all, is not so shabby. For the primary lesson 
Buchanan brings to the reform clamor will remain untainted by any epilogue. 
It's not about educational strategy, but about hope, and the power of one. It 
is this: Every so often someone can come along with the right mix of instinct, 
know-how, ego and courage, and make something happen, something big. Who knows? 
Maybe in that crowded, noisy field of reformers are one or two players who 
actually know their stuff, and how to pull it off. And wouldn't that be a nice 
surprise.

HARVEST IS ONLY HALF THE BATTLE; TO REAP PROFITS, GROWERS MUST CULTIVATE 
FAR-FLUNG MARKETS AND OUTWIT COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The field bristles with contrasting shapes, sizes and colors. A broad oval 
here, a spiky nub there. A deep green, a silver sheen. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancher Jim Roberts staggered the planting of the field in eight-acre strips, 
so his workers have been picking the three types of lettuce, radishes and 
turnips steadily throughout the winter. So far, they've harvested about half of 
the 60 acres dubbed Conejo Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 As always, the laborers have encountered a few weeds and bugs as they trudge 
through the endless bend and pick rhythm of the harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 But overall, the field's done all right. "We've sold most of the crop," he 
said. "That's what counts." 
</P>
<P>
 It's been nearly a year since a trio of ranchers bought the 60-acre patch for 
$420,000, taking out hefty bank loans and risking their other landholdings as 
collateral. They spent countless hours -- and hundreds of thousands of dollars 
-- preparing the long-abandoned acreage for planting. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after months of sowing millions of seeds, the farmers are ready to reap 
the profits. But first they must harvest the blooming field and find markets 
for their gourmet greens. 
</P>
<P>
 Abandoned for more than a decade before Roberts and his partners reclaimed the 
swampy land for agriculture, Conejo Ranch has survived its first big test. But 
the partners at Underwood Ranches remain disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 The culprit: this winter's confoundingly perfect weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Unscathed by October's wildfires, January's earthquake and February's 
mudslides, many ranches across Southern California have produced bumper crops. 
</P>
<P>
 The crackling freezes that usually grip the Imperial Valley have skipped 
eastward. The cold, wet weather that usually dampens the Salinas harvest has 
made way for mild, spring-like temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Extended growing seasons in both regions have meant more competition for 
Underwood Ranches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, winter means bad weather. Winter means frost. Winter means rain, 
disrupted planting seasons, lettuce crops freezing on the stalks," sales 
director Minos Athanassiadis said. "Usually, winter tightens up the supply and 
lets us bring our prices above break-even." 
</P>
<P>
 Usually. But not this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The average price farmers receive for their gourmet salad -- a tumble of baby 
lettuce and exotic greens -- has dropped to less than $9 for a three-pound box 
this year. Normally, that box would sell for about $12. Four years ago, when 
horrendous weather devastated the competition, even salad of mediocre quality 
fetched $14 a box. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the bad weather elsewhere in the country is causing as much 
consternation as the unyielding warmth in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Slick roads and sinking temperatures back East have nibbled steadily away at 
the demand for fresh produce, as consumers have cut back on trips to 
restaurants and supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the bulging supply and constricted demand, Underwood Ranches partners 
still earn 15% on their salad some months, when the capricious market breaks 
their way. But mostly, they've been watching net revenues dip further and 
further. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, harvest at Conejo Ranch continues. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent sodden morning, Agustin Garcia drove a tractor through the muck to 
collect lettuce-laden crates and place empties in position for the next day's 
harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 The tractor's massive wheels wobbled drunkenly in the thick, grasping mud. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard, huh?" Garcia said, grinning. "But I have to work." 
</P>
<P>
 The field hands, mainly Mexican immigrants, start the morning at dawn, when 
their foreman receives the day's order by walkie-talkie. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few years ago, however, at other Underwood Ranches operations, 
walkie-talkies seemed a frill. 
</P>
<P>
 As Underwood lurched toward large-scale production of baby lettuce in the late 
1980s, the partners lacked critical technology. And they came up with some 
pretty wacky substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 An old Speed Queen laundry machine hooked up to a lawn mower engine, for 
example, served as an industrial-sized spinner to dry salad greens. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the farmers plugged in six industrial-size washers for spinning salad. 
But they never got around to disconnecting the coin boxes, so they had to keep 
a good supply of quarters on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the cash to compete with the big growers, so we have to 
outthink them, outwork them or come up with something new," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, of course, the salad preparation technology has become more 
sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
 So sophisticated, in fact, that Underwood officials will not divulge many 
details about their cooling, drying and packing operations, lest the 
competition catch on to techniques they spent years developing. 
</P>
<P>
 The basics, though, they do explain. 
</P>
<P>
 Because leaves lose a day of shelf life for each hour they sit in the sun, 
workers immediately cool the harvest after it's brought from the field to the 
packing house in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Some greens get an icy 20-minute shower under a waterfall, known as a 
hydrocooler. Others sit, draped with a tarp, in front of a giant suction 
machine that whips cold air through the leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a race to get it cold as fast as you can," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once cooled, the greens are dumped into a trough of water to be washed. 
Finally, the salad is dried in a high-tech version of the laundry machines and 
packed into plastic-lined boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, the Camarillo-bred greens embark on the journey to supermarkets, 
restaurants and specialty groceries across the United States and as far away as 
Canada and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In an East Los Angeles warehouse bare but for a basketball net and a metal 
shipping crate, Jim Ptaszenski adds the third of six price markups to gourmet 
greens from Conejo Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 The salad has traveled 55 miles from the emerald field at the base of the 
Conejo Grade. But already, the price has jumped more than 110% above the cost 
of producing the ready-to-eat mix. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the price of a salad may spike nearly 220% above Underwood Ranches' 
production cost by the time it arrives at a far-flung dinner table. 
</P>
<P>
 To get their salad to a grocery store in Des Moines, the Underwood partners 
start by shipping it to the Los Angeles Produce Market, where they sell it to a 
terminal marketer specializing in offbeat vegetables. He bundles the salad with 
other gourmet items and trucks it to a consolidator. It gets packed and shipped 
to Chicago, where it is sorted and repacked, perhaps with Florida tomatoes or 
Idaho potatoes. It is then shipped by truck to a Des Moines warehouse where 
retailers purchase produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Like all businessmen, farmers must continually market their product. 
</P>
<P>
 So Craig Underwood hauled out his Sunday best late last month for the national 
produce expo in the San Diego Convention Center, where 600 growers showed off 
their crops to retailers and wholesalers. 
</P>
<P>
 To satisfy big-ticket wholesalers who like to claim exclusive distribution 
rights, the Underwood partners market their carrots under several labels. 
</P>
<P>
 The ready-to-eat baby carrots, for example, are sold through one wholesaler as 
Sweet Petite and through another as Melissa's. Unpeeled carrots also come in 
two varieties identical but for the name: Underwood Ranches and Las Posas 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Always seeking new customers, for whatever label, marketing manager Dana 
Abercrombie beamed when Walt Disney World's chief buyer, Lynn Stogsdill, tasted 
a Sweet Petite carrot at the San Diego expo. His cautious verdict: "Looks like 
an interesting product." 
</P>
<P>
 Though she would love to woo a big customer like Disney World, Abercrombie 
also handed free carrots to grandmothers, toddlers and all who wandered by her 
booth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to have our products circulating in the industry," she said. "It shows 
we're a player." ABOUT THIS SERIES 
</P>
<P>
 "60 Acres of Hope," a series that began in October, traces the first year of a 
Southern California farm field. The first two articles detailed the field's 
history and first planting, and looked at the ranchers and laborers who work 
the land. This story focuses on the first harvest, the packing, distribution 
and marketing strategy. Future articles will explore the economics of farming 
and the ranchers' attempts to find a niche in the crowded produce industry.

CHILD CARE A KEY HURDLE TO CLINTON WELFARE PLAN; REFORM: PRESIDENT'S TASK FORCE 
IS HARD-PRESSED TO DESIGN AFFORDABLE PLAN TO KEEP HIS PLEDGE TO END WELFARE 'AS 
WE KNOW IT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like thousands of other single mothers who support their families on welfare, 
Carolyn Bates is trying to do what President Clinton wants her to do -- make it 
on her own. 
</P>
<P>
 The obstacles are no less formidable for their familiarity: only a high school 
diploma, an all-but-empty resume and a home in a poor, crime-infested part of 
Baltimore far from any job. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bates said that arranging reliable child care for her 6-year-old daughter 
and 8-year-old son is the biggest hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
 Although her on-the-job training program provides money for day care, the only 
licensed centers in her area that seem safe and comfortable also have long 
waiting lists. Relatives who agreed to watch the children were not dependable. 
So for now she leaves her training job early to pick up her children from 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 But she knows this will not be possible when she finds a real job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want a very good job," said Bates, 34. "Something me and my kids can live 
off. But if I can't find good child care where my kids are comfortable, I'm 
going to wind up not working." 
</P>
<P>
 "But I need to work," she said, her voice filling with anxiety. "I don't want 
to lay around getting checks. I'm not happy doing that. I am able and I want to 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Bates, many single mothers nationally cannot work because their children 
have nowhere to go. Her predicament, multiplied millions of times, poses a huge 
challenge for the policy designers assigned by President Clinton to come up 
with an affordable plan to keep his campaign pledge to "end welfare as we know 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 With yearly per-child costs running from $3,000 to $5,000, child care is the 
most expensive part of welfare reform plans that require parents to work 
instead of staying at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Child care is in short supply in many poor urban neighborhoods and rural areas 
-- especially high-quality care available at the odd hours that are typical of 
the bottom-of-the-ladder jobs that former welfare recipients often get. 
</P>
<P>
 An Administration task force is grappling with this issue as it prepares a 
welfare reform program for Clinton's consideration. What appears to be its 
preferred approach -- limiting welfare benefits to two years and then turning 
recipients out onto the job market -- would send as many as 2 million of the 
youngest welfare recipients searching for child care. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's welfare reformers said they have not estimated how many 
new children would need government-subsidized child care under that approach, 
but they expressed confidence the supply will be adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We agree that child care is one of the most important parts of the equation," 
said Walter D. Broadnax, who as deputy secretary of health and human services 
is on the welfare reform task force. "The only problem is paying for it." 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, the Administration is considering more than doubling the $1.5 
billion a year that the government now spends for child care for the working 
poor. Administration officials are counting on private businesses, nonprofit 
organizations and even former welfare recipients to respond to the increased 
demand for child care. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is so hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you're talking about is thousands and thousands currently on waiting 
lists for subsidized child care slots and welfare reform is going to create 
thousands and thousands more," said Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). "We're talking 
about a tidal wave for a system that is already stressed out." 
</P>
<P>
 Wyden said the federal government will have to provide substantial new money 
and to regulate child care more closely. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't do welfare reform unless you do child care reform," he said. "We've 
got to make sure the welfare reformers understand that this is too important to 
be short shrifted." 
</P>
<P>
 Some conservatives argue that child care costs are so huge that welfare reform 
should be targeted to put recipients who need the least child care -- those 
with older children -- into training and jobs first. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's current favored reform concept takes the opposite 
approach, targeting recipients under the age of 25. But they are the most 
likely to have additional children who will need child care for the longest 
period of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal and state assistance for child care has mushroomed in the last five 
years, with the federal contribution growing from $660 million in 1988 to about 
$1.5 billion this year. But federally subsidized care for people leaving 
welfare is guaranteed for only a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucretia Dean, a single mother who stopped getting welfare checks and started 
working last October, already sees a child care deadline looming. 
</P>
<P>
 As a nurse's aide at a Baltimore nursing home, Dean earns $6.25 an hour -- 
more than many former welfare recipients -- but only on a part-time basis. She 
said she hopes to get a job at a local hospital before her year of transitional 
child care is used up. But even then, she would earn only another $1.25 an 
hour, and paying $85 a week for child care would still be impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're just starting out, they're going to give you minimum wage or a 
little more, and that doesn't come close to covering rent, utilities, 
transportation, food and day care," Dean said as she picked up her 4-year-old 
son from a child care center in a working-class neighborhood. "But they don't 
think about that when they say: 'Everybody get a job.' Child care really is the 
biggest issue when you're trying to get off welfare and stay off." 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois' welfare policy-makers thought they had a solution. They took another 
federally funded child care program -- for people at risk of going on welfare 
because their incomes are less than 75% of the median -- and targeted it at 
former welfare recipients whose year of transitional day care subsidies had 
been exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
 The hope was that their incomes would increase to the point where they no 
longer would be eligible for subsidies of any kind. But more than two-thirds of 
those who received extensions were still using them a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these jobs do not have career ladders that will ever enable them to 
afford child care," said Michelle Piel, the manager of child care and 
development at the Illinois Department of Public Aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, because the maximum number of people are using the "at risk" child care 
program, the state is cutting former welfare recipients off after the year of 
transitional care. Some of those people already are back on welfare, Piel said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1990 survey of 7,000 recipients of aid to families with dependent 
children, a quarter of the respondents said they quit a job or school because 
of child care, Piel said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Texas, acclaimed for setting up a particularly efficient subsidized child 
care system, the number of children receiving care soared from fewer than 
17,000 in 1989 to more than 60,000 in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many working poor families still cannot get the services for which they 
are eligible. "There are at least as many children on waiting lists as there 
are in care," said Charlotte Brandtley, director of child care for the Texas 
Social Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 For public treasuries, it is clearly cheaper over the short term to let 
welfare recipients stay home with their children rather than pay for their 
child care while they receive training and go to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Staying at home, a mother of two preschool children in Illinois would receive 
a $367 welfare check each month. But if she took a minimum-wage job, the 
government would still pay her $135 a month in welfare benefits plus $600-$800 
a month for child care for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost notwithstanding, a consensus is forming among policy-makers that it is 
better for everybody -- welfare recipients, their children and society at large 
-- if single parents are required to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare recipients themselves are not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the government should make it mandatory for a parent to put a 
small child in day care before the child can talk," said Angela Candy, 33, a 
mother of three who is trying to make the transition from welfare to work. 
"What if something bad is happening to the child?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel the opposite," said Rhonda Clark, 24, who recently started a job and 
went off welfare after receiving it off and on for seven years. She and her two 
children live across the street from a public housing project, and she says she 
sees the terrible influence on the children when their parents collect welfare 
checks every month. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as a child is in the home, he or she only gets what the parent has to 
offer," Clark said. "And if that parent is staying home all day watching TV and 
chatting with friends, that's the only life the child knows. That's why most of 
them grow up and end up on social services too." She said children as young as 
1 or 2 years old are better served by having their mothers working: "They're at 
a very impressionable age. Things stick in their minds. The more exposure they 
get to other lifestyles the better."

 A Hasidic Jew who was left brain-dead after a man opened fire on a van full of 
rabbinical students died Saturday, a spokeswoman at St. Vincent's Hospital 
said. 
</P>

 Aaron Halberstam, 16, was one of four students wounded Tuesday on the Brooklyn 
Bridge when a gunman opened fire on their van.Rashad Baz, 28, has been charged 
with 15 counts of attempted murder and is being held without bond.

BOSNIAN SERB ARTILLERY MAY BE TEST OF CEASE-FIRE, U.N. SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United Nations confirmed Saturday that more Bosnian Serb artillery has 
been spotted around Sarajevo in what U.N. officials believe might be intended 
to test enforcement of the cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is obvious that there still are some heavy weapons not under our control," 
said Maj. Rob Annink, a spokesman for U.N. peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 He was referring to disclosures that peacekeepers found six Serb 
122-millimeter howitzers late Thursday just inside the NATO-mandated 12-mile 
exclusion zone around the Bosnian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Annink said five of the howitzers had been pulled out of the zone and that the 
last was to be removed Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the discovery of the artillery, along with gunfire and grenade exchanges 
between Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim-led government troops defending Sarajevo, 
raised fears that the three-week cease-fire could be in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials did not make clear whether Serbs recently had moved the six 
howitzers back into the zone or whether the guns simply were discovered 
belatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO has threatened to bomb any heavy weapons not pulled back from Sarajevo or 
put under U.N. control. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials say Bosnian Serbs have mostly complied, making NATO air strikes 
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 But with major powers cool to a U.N. plea for thousands more troops to police 
the fragile cease-fire, there was concern that Serbs might be testing the 
international community's resolve.

VATICAN AGREES TO OPEN FULL RELATIONS WITH SOUTH AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Vatican announced Saturday that it will open full diplomatic relations 
with South Africa, clearing the way for an official papal visit to a country 
that far-traveled John Paul II has so far only glimpsed by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord to formalize ties at the ambassadorial level with Pretoria adds to 
a string of recent initiatives that has extended the Vatican's diplomatic 
presence in some of the world's most contentious regions: It opened relations 
with Israel in December and with Jordan last week. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of Saturday's accord, John Paul II intends to add a South Africa 
stop to a long-planned trip following a synod of African bishops at the 
Vatican. The trip is tentatively scheduled for early November, Vatican sources 
say, but could be delayed until January because of the pressures of the Pope's 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement demonstrates the Vatican's confidence in ongoing reforms "to lay 
the base for a pluralistic and democratic" society, said papal spokesman 
Joaquin Navarro, praising the "growing maturity of the consciousness of all of 
South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 Formal establishment of relations had been expected after South African 
President Frederik W. de Klerk visited the Vatican in December and invited the 
Pope to his country. 
</P>
<P>
 During the apartheid years, when churches rallied opponents of enforced 
segregation, bishops representing South Africa's 3 million Catholics were 
divided over the advisability of a papal visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite repeated trips to neighboring countries, John Paul, who inveighs 
against racism at every opportunity, decided to stay away from South Africa 
while it was ruled by force of the white minority. 
</P>
<P>
 Nature intervened, though, and in 1988 John Paul saw five hours of South 
African countryside from the back of a white sedan. 
</P>
<P>
 Prevented by bad weather from landing as scheduled in the kingdom of Lesotho 
after a flight from Botswana, the pontiff's plane diverted to Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
 After considerable tarmac consternation and confusion that seemed to amuse 
John Paul, Vatican and South African officials agreed to pretend he was not in 
South Africa. No official welcome, no ceremonies, no kiss of the ground, just 
handshakes and a quick goodby. 
</P>

<P>
 Kurt Cobain, the lead singer and guitarist for the American rock band Nirvana, 
was in greatly improved condition Saturday after emerging from a coma caused by 
mixing alcohol and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today he came out of the coma . . . , is able to breathe sufficiently and can 
talk," American Hospital said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 It added that the hospital hopes to take Cobain off the critical list today or 
Monday if his improvement continues. 
</P>
<P>
 The 27-year-old Cobain was rushed to a Rome hospital Friday morning after 
collapsing at the luxury hotel where he was staying with his wife and daughter 
during a break in the band's European tour. 
</P>
<P>
 The rock star has a history of drug problems and has admitted taking heroin, 
but the statement Saturday said that his illness was caused by the combined 
effects of alcohol and prescribed tranquilizers.

 British police, pulling apart a house where up to five bodies have already 
been found, fear they may unearth 12 victims of a suspected serial killer, the 
Sunday Mirror newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believed they found remains of two people Saturday at the home of a man 
already charged with three murders and said there was a "distinct possibility" 
of further finds. 
</P>
<P>
 They uncovered the corpses of three women last week in what the media has 
branded the "garden of death" at the house in the western English city of 
Gloucester. They found more remains when they turned their attention to the 
house itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Frederick West, a 52-year-old builder with some 10 children from two

 Young Arabs and Israeli troops clashed in Jerusalem on Saturday after a 
guerrilla hero exhorted Palestinians to take up arms again at a rally marking 
the Hebron mosque massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 There were few casualties. But the incidents underlined how the shock waves 
from the massacre continue to reverberate around the Holy Land, sharpening old

</P>
<P>
 Palestinian leaders said the Palestine Liberation Organization should insist 
on modifying its self-rule deal with Israel so that some Jewish settlements

RENO INTERVENES TO LET CONVICT VISIT HIS DYING SON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A dying 18-year-old's wish to see his imprisoned father one last time was 
granted Saturday after U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno overruled a warden's denial 
of the request. 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of the night, guards secretly whisked 47-year-old Salvador 
Guzman from a Wisconsin prison to a Chicago hospital to see his son, David 
Stenner, who has leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bureau of Prisons did temper justice with mercy in this case," said 
attorney Sheldon T. Zenner, who worked with the Starlight Foundation, a charity 
that tries to realize the wishes of sick children. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the 25-minute meeting were kept private. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno and other federal prison officials overrode the decision of John Hurley, 
warden of the federal prison in Oxford, Wis., Zenner said. Hurley had denied 
the visit on several occasions last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Bureau of Prisons officials would confirm only that the meeting took place and 
said Hurley would not answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Guzman is serving a 15-year sentence after being convicted in Portland, Ore., 
of conspiracy to distribute heroin. He is due to be released in 2006. 
</P>
<P>
 Stenner, confined in a sterile hospital environment, was unable to visit his 
father. He had an unsuccessful bone marrow transplant a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois Gov. Jim Edgar and other politicians tried to intervene Thursday, but 
the warden denied their requests. Daniel Dunne, a spokesman for the Federal 
Bureau of Prisons in Washington, said at the time, "I could assure you we would 
grant the request if public safety were not an issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Zenner said Reno first called him on Thursday but did not make any promises. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Bureau of Prisons Director Kathleen Hawk contacted him and said 
she and Reno "would take a really hard look at whether there was some way to 
make David Stenner's wish come true without jeopardizing anyone's security," 
Zenner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very grateful to learn, early this morning, they found a way to do 
it," he said.

'CONSERVATIVE SUMMIT' DENOUNCES BUSH, MUCH OF GOP; POLITICS: PARTICIPANTS 
REVEAL SIGNIFICANT DIVISIONS WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ON KEY ISSUES RANGING 
FROM HEALTH CARE TO IMMIGRATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a sign of continued division within GOP ranks, it wasn't the Democrat 
currently residing in the White House who drew most of the fire Saturday at a 
conference of conservative activists -- it was his Republican predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers at the "Conservative Summit" convened by National Review magazine 
disparaged George Bush, lashed the GOP congressional leadership for "failure of 
nerve" and indicted party moderates as traitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, participants bared significant divisions within the party on 
such key issues as trade, foreign policy, health care and immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, the assessment of the GOP's condition sounded as if it were lifted 
from a Democratic National Committee meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The GOP, in my view, approaches the midterm election as a party without a 
clear philosophy," warned former GOP presidential candidate Pierre S. (Pete) du 
Pont IV, now chairman of the conservative magazine's National Review Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives, added pollster Tony Fabrizio, "are making a big mistake if we 
look to the Republican Party for leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Less surprising, President Clinton also took his lumps at the gathering -- on 
foreign policy, economics, health care and social issues. One speaker accused 
him of espousing a "mushy multilateralism" in foreign affairs; another said 
that on civil rights a "quota mentality (is) running rampant in the 
Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 William Kristol, chairman of the Project for the Republican Future and an 
advocate of uncompromising GOP opposition to Clinton's health care reform 
package, pronounced the Administration's health care initiative virtually dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was supposed to be the poster child of his Administration, and it's become 
a tar baby," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the attacks on Clinton paled against the intensity of the recriminations 
against Bush, who was accused of squandering the political legacy bequeathed to 
the GOP by Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Du Pont set the tone with his conference-opening remarks, lamenting "the 
Republican catastrophe of 1990-92, when a Republican Administration enacted the 
Democratic Party platform." 
</P>
<P>
 Bush doomed the GOP, he said, by accepting higher taxes and signing civil 
rights legislation that was virtually identical to an earlier version he vetoed 
as a "quota bill." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republican Party paid a terrible price for this deviation," Du Pont said. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservative broadsides at Bush's legacy represent more than mere 
disappointment over the loss of the White House after 12 years. They also 
constitute another salvo in an ongoing GOP struggle over the party's response 
to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992, some GOP moderates have argued that Bush failed because he leaned 
too far to the right, particularly on social issues. The conservatives hope to 
blunt that argument by contending that Bush lost because he failed to adhere to 
Reaganite principles. 
</P>
<P>
 As Kristol put it: "It is important to get history right if we are going to 
get the future right." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, congressional Republicans drew almost as much fire as Bush or Clinton. 
Repeatedly, speakers ridiculed the GOP congressional leadership for allowing 
the President to seize the initiative on such key issues as crime and welfare 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the extent he has co-opted some Republican themes, it is an indictment of 
Republicans for not making our case seriously enough," Kristol said. 
</P>
<P>
 A particular target was Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.), who has authored the 
most moderate of the GOP alternatives to Clinton's health care reform package. 
"The party is really in a sad state of affairs when we have to depend on John 
Chafee to be our moral leader on health care," Fabrizio said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if those attending the gathering were united in their denunciation of the 
Republican moderate strain represented by Bush and Chafee, they also displayed 
significant divisions over the future course of the conservative movement. 
</P>
<P>
 At one session, Elliott Abrams, an assistant secretary of state in the Reagan 
Administration, clashed with Angela (Bay) Buchanan, who managed her brother 
Patrick J. Buchanan's 1992 presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Abrams insisted that Patrick Buchanan, Ross Perot and other conservative 
critics of free trade and active U.S. involvement abroad display an "attitude 
of fear or lack of confidence" about America's economic and diplomatic 
capacities. 
</P>
<P>
 Bay Buchanan fired back: "Protectionism isn't all bad if it is in the interest 
of American jobs, American interests, American industry." 
</P>
<P>
 After another session, Ralph E. Reed Jr., executive director of broadcaster 
Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition, raised a warning flag about Patrick 
Buchanan and other GOP leaders advocating an ever-toughening position against 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Emphasizing that his organization had not yet taken a position on the issue, 
Reed said the offensive against immigration risked driving millions of new 
arrivals into Democratic ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Republican Party moves toward a nativist impulse and becomes perceived 
as a party that wants to build a wall around America . . . , they could find 
themselves in the same political situation they were in with the immigrants of 
Eastern and Southern Europe," he said. Those Europeans, he noted, became a 
cornerstone of the Democratic New Deal political coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the conference did reaffirm conservative consensus on several large 
issues -- particularly opposition to new taxes and a commitment to social 
issues such as banning abortion -- the proceedings provided ample evidence for 
Bay Buchanan's summation: "As conservatives, we are spread all over. It is time 
to stop this notion that we will all get together."

EX-MAYOR'S SON WINS RUNOFF IN NEW ORLEANS; ELECTION: MARC MORIAL, WHOSE FATHER 
WAS CITY'S FIRST BLACK LEADER, CAPTURES 54% OF VOTES IN CAMPAIGN MARRED BY 
RACIST AND ANTI-SEMITIC FLYERS.

<P>
 State Sen. Marc Morial, the son of the city's first black mayor, won a mayoral 
runoff election Saturday after a campaign dominated by racist and anti-Semitic 
flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Mintz, a white attorney, conceded defeat about two hours after the 
polls closed. 
</P>
<P>
 With 421 of 474 precincts reporting, Morial had 83,363 votes, or 54%, to 
Mintz's 69,957, or 46%. 
</P>
<P>
 Morial is the son of Ernest (Dutch) Morial, who served two terms as mayor from 
1978 to 1986. Mintz lost a mayoral runoff four years ago. Both are Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Morial succeeds Sidney Barthelemy, who was ineligible to run after two terms. 
He will inherit recurring money woes with a $380-million-plus budget; the 
prospect of dealing with the world's largest gambling casino, expected to open 
in the next year or two; and a record murder rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Morial, 36, was one of two former mayor's sons in the race. State Rep. Mitch 
Landrieu, the son of the city's last white mayor, Moon Landrieu, ran third in 
the primary behind Morial and Mintz. 
</P>
<P>
 As the race began late last year with 10 candidates, polls showed crime and 
dissatisfaction with a patronage-laden City Hall as the key issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Then flyers began appearing on doorsteps. One flyer alleged back room deals 
between Morial and Landrieu and questioned Morial's sexual orientation. Others 
were peppered with swastikas and racist and anti-Semitic remarks later 
described by an investigative committee as "ghastly." 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 4, a day before the primary in which all candidates compete regardless 
of party affiliation, a grand jury indicted an unpaid Mintz adviser, Napoleon 
Moses, on a misdemeanor charge of distributing anonymous -- and therefore 
illegal -- campaign flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mintz, 51, said he knew nothing about the flyers and dismissed Moses, but 
Morial blamed Mintz's camp. In turn, Mintz's campaign accused Morial of 
planting spies and using publicity from an investigation into the flyers as 
dirty campaign tactic.

GUNMAN SLAIN BY UTAH DEPUTY WHO SLIPPED IN WITH HOSTAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A gunman carrying a crude bomb took 18 people hostage Saturday at the Salt 
Lake City Library, then was fatally shot by a deputy who had snuck in among the 
hostages. 
</P>
<P>
 Salt Lake County sheriff's Lt. Lloyd Prescott was teaching a class for police 
officers in a room next to the one where the gunman took the hostages, Lt. 
Marty Vuyk said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made a super move. He became the last hostage by walking in the room and 
closing the door behind him," Vuyk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prescott was dressed in a sweat suit. He identified himself as a sheriff's 
officer after the gunman told the hostages to draw lots, apparently to 
determine the order in which they would be killed, said Salt Lake County 
Sheriff Aaron Kennard. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman swung his gun on Prescott and the deputy then shot him four times 
in the chest and wrestled him to the ground, Kennard said. None of the hostages 
were hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Two SWAT team members received minor cuts from broken glass as they rushed 
into the room. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman, identified as Clifford Lynn Draper, died at LDS Hospital, Vuyk 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5 1/2-hour ordeal began just after a group of Tibetan Buddhist monks had 
dismantled an intricate sand painting they had created over four days at the 
library. 
</P>
<P>
 The monks, who live in exile in India, were to scatter the painting and throw 
its grains into the nearby Jordan River. They were not taken hostage. 
</P>
<P>
 The man leaped onto a table, pulled out a handgun and announced: "Have a nice 
life. Mine's probably over," witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio station KSL quoted witnesses as saying the gunman told them he had a 
bomb "big enough to blow up the whole building." 
</P>
<P>
 The man was holding a hair-curling iron with wires leading into a shoulder 
bag, witness Jan Carlston said. The man held the curling iron open and 
threatened that the bomb would go off if he closed it, Carlston added. 
</P>
<P>
 The curling iron did not set off the bomb, which was later detonated in the 
library by a bomb squad. 
</P>
<P>
 During telephone negotiations with police, Vuyk said, Draper demanded money, 
an audience with Salt Lake City Police Chief Ruben Ortega and a pardon from 
President Clinton. Ortega was in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people managed to escape as the gunman herded the hostages to the room on 
the second floor. Hostage Carl Robinson said Prescott suddenly showed up as 
they were being herded into the room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said: 'Get out of here.' He said: 'It's OK. I'm with the sheriff's 
department,' " Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Draper gave a sealed letter he wanted mailed to the local Deseret News to the 
head Buddhist monk, who had followed the group to the second floor. The monk, 
who does not speak English, didn't know what to do with the letter and gave it 
to Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman let Robinson go free so he could mail the letter and let the monk 
go with him. Robinson told police that the deputy was among the hostages.

NASA BAFFLED BY STRANGE READING ON FUEL LINE OF SHUTTLE POWER UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NASA struggled Saturday to understand unusually high pressure readings in a 
fuel line for one of the shuttle Columbia's three auxiliary power units. 
</P>
<P>
 The units, called APUs, generate power to drive hydraulic pumps that supply 
pressure for Columbia's critical hydraulic systems, including the landing gear 
and nose-wheel steering. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission operations director Lee Briscoe said the problem could be a bad 
pressure sensor, contamination on that sensor, instrument trouble or a blocked 
fuel line. 
</P>
<P>
 He stressed that it is too soon to say whether the affected APU might be in 
danger of shutting down. If it does, Columbia will have to come home early. 
</P>
<P>
 The shuttle's 14-day research mission began Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 National Aeronautics and Space Administration flight rules require three 
working APUs. As of Saturday, all three of Columbia's APUs were working. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really don't know what we have," Briscoe said. "The system appears to be 
working . . . right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Later Saturday, Mission Control asked the crew members to open a valve in the 
APU fuel line to see how that would affect the pressure readings. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, Columbia's five astronauts, trying not to ruin fragile 
crystals growing on board, tiptoed around the shuttle like cooks protecting 
their souffles. 
</P>
<P>
 The astronauts took turns pedaling on a stationary cycle equipped with a 
vibration absorber. Muscles become flabby in weightlessness, which is a 
liability if an emergency requires speed and strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilot Andrew Allen and Charles (Sam) Gemar also slipped one at a time into a 
waist-high sack that, by reducing pressure, forces blood from the top of their 
bodies into their legs to simulate gravity. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors believe that repeated sessions in the vacuum sack can help prevent 
dizziness at the end of a flight, especially a long one like the current 
mission.

GRACE SLICK ACCUSED OF AIMING GUN AT OFFICERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Jefferson Starship lead singer Grace Slick was released on bail 
Saturday morning after being booked on charges of felony assault and felony 
brandishing a weapon at a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers from the Tiburon Police Department went to the singer's Marin County 
home after receiving a call at 3:30 a.m. Saturday from an apparently 
intoxicated man who said a drunken woman was firing a shotgun in the house, the 
police report said. 
</P>
<P>
 When officers arrived, Ira Lee, 58, came to the door yelling "Kill me!" police 
said. Officers subdued him. 
</P>
<P>
 Slick came to the door carrying a shotgun. She pointed it at the officers, and 
yelled at them to leave her property, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 54-year-old singer refused to drop the shotgun when ordered to do so by 
police, but Officer Bob Rossi was able to wrestle the gun away from her when 
her attention was diverted, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marin County Jail officials said Slick, also known as Grace Johnson, posted 
$7,000 bail Saturday morning. Lee was taken to Marin General Hospital for 
evaluation, Tiburon police said.

SPIELBERG WINS DIRECTORS' AWARD FOR 'SCHINDLER'S LIST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Steven Spielberg added the Directors Guild of America Award on Saturday night 
to the growing array of accolades given to him for his epic motion picture 
"Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 The directors' honor suggests that Spielberg and the movie will take home 
Oscars when they are awarded by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences 
on March 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Although other outcomes are possible -- Oscar ballots were only mailed to 
academy voters Friday -- history is on Spielberg's side. Only three times since 
the guild began giving awards in 1949 has the winner of the guild's prize 
failed to also win the Oscar for direction. And typically, academy voters also 
give the Oscar for best picture of the year to their best director winner. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time there was an exception was 1985 and it involved Spielberg. The 
guild prize went to him for directing "The Color Purple," but the Oscar went to 
Sydney Pollack for "Out of Africa."  
</P>
<P>
 A directing Oscar for the prolific Spielberg, the world's most commercially 
successful director, would be his first. 
</P>
<P>
 The Directors Guild prizes for feature film, television and advertising were 
awarded in a dinner ceremony at the Beverly Hilton Hotel and in New York. 
Spielberg was present in Beverly Hills to accept his award. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schindler's List" was voted best film of 1993 by the major critics groups and 
won the Golden Globe best drama prize.

STUDY FINDS 'POWER RANGERS' STIRS AGGRESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After spending two afternoons watching elementary school children play, two 
undergraduate Cal State Fullerton researchers have a warning for parents: 
Allowing your children to watch "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" can be dangerous 
to other childrens' health. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers reported that children exposed to a "Power Rangers" episode 
immediately responded by harassing playmates with karate kicks and aggressive 
shoves. 
</P>
<P>
 Children who did not watch the single episode of the Fox mega-hit did nothing 
worse than take other youngsters' crayons in the hour after the show, the 
observers found in their two-day study last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the scary things about violence in the media is it gives children new 
ideas about how to be aggressive and be violent," said assistant professor 
Chris Boyatzis , a member of the Cal State Fullerton Child Development 
Department, who oversaw the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think parents need to observe what their children are watching," said 
Kristen Nesbitt, a 23-year-old undergraduate who will submit the results of 
what began as a simple class project for publication in a psychology journal. 
"A lot of times kids take what they see on TV out to the real world." 
</P>
<P>
 What millions of kids see each week on "Power Rangers" is five teen-agers 
"morphing" into super-heroes who use karate chops and magic swords to conquer 
monsters sent to Earth by Rita Repulsa, the Empress of Evil. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's creators at Saban Entertainment deny that it makes youngsters 
violent, saying that each episode concludes with a positive message and that 
children who watch the live-action show know the fight scenes are just fantasy. 
A publicist for the producer declined further comment, saying he had not yet 
seen the study. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Nesbitt and Gina Matillo, another undergraduate studying child 
development, split 52 after-school day-care students at Brea's Mariposa 
Elementary School into two groups. 
</P>
<P>
 They showed one group of the 6- to 11-year-olds a 23-minute episode of "Power 
Rangers" that contained 140 aggressive acts, according to their count. Then the 
researchers watched the children play indoors as they waited for their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, the researchers watched the second group playing with the same 
toys in the same room, but without having first seen "Power Rangers." 
</P>
<P>
 The students watched each child in the two groups for two minutes apiece, 
logging acts of aggression, including karate moves, hitting, pushing, and 
stealing. They found that the children who had watched "Power Rangers" were 
aggressive six times more often than the children who had not. 
</P>
<P>
 The children who had watched "Power Rangers" imitated the martial arts 
sequences down to specific kicks, somersaults and arm movements -- even echoing 
the sounds that the characters made, the researchers reported.

GIRL DIES WHEN CAR ROLLS OVER 5 TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A car carrying six teen-age girls on their way to a slumber party cartwheeled 
five times through rush-hour traffic, killing a 16-year-old passenger and 
critically injuring another, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness said the driver was traveling at a high rate of speed when she 
swerved right and then left.The car cartwheeled through the median, landed on 
its roof and slid through two lanes of oncoming rush-hour traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 5 p.m. Friday near Concord, 24 miles northeast of 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The Contra Costa County Coroner's office identified the dead girl as Vanessa 
Risso of Pittsburg. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old driver was taken to John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek, 
where she was listed in serious but stable condition with a skull fracture. 
</P>
<P>
 A 16-year-old girl was at John Muir in critical condition. Three 17-year-old 
victims were taken to Mt. Diablo Hospital. One was listed in fair condition, 
the other in good condition, and a third was treated and released Friday night.

BROWN, GARAMENDI RALLY ORANGE COUNTY DEMOCRATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown and state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi 
brought their gubernatorial campaigns to a convention of Orange County 
Democrats on Saturday, virtually ignoring each other and instead aiming their 
fire at Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 In a straw poll taken throughout the day, Brown beat Garamendi by 140 votes to 
114. The third Democrat in the race, state Sen. Tom Hayden of Santa Monica, did 
not attend the meeting but received 27 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The convention of about 500 Orange County Democrats served as a pep rally for 
the political party seeking to build momentum in a county controlled by the 
Republican Party, which holds an 18-point voter registration margin over 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading off a forum for statewide candidates, Brown said that until Wilson 
faced the pressure of an election year he did not fight the migration of 
California jobs to other states, that he cut education funding without trying 
to improve schools, and that he "talks tough on crime at the front door while 
he lets dangerous parolees out the back door." 
</P>
<P>
 Californians, she said, do not feel safer and do not feel more economic 
security than they did before Wilson took office. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's why we need a change from the Rip Van Wilson who's been sleeping 
and slumbering for the last three years in the governor's office," Brown told 
the delegates. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, who has attracted attention in local communities throughout the 
state by "working" side-by-side with everyday workers such as jailers, teachers 
and factory workers, said Wilson "does not have a clue; does not have the 
foggiest understanding of what's taking place" on issues such as worker safety 
and California's choked transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi grew more passionate as he spoke about health care. His own plan for 
California, never approved, served as a starting point for development of 
President Clinton's health care plan that has run into a firestorm of 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I hear after 25 years of my crusade to establish a national health plan, 
when I hear the Republicans say to me that there's no health crisis, oh boy, 
I'm telling you, we are in for a fight," Garamendi said. "We will have a 
national health plan that provides health care to every single American, and it 
will be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, state Democratic Party Chairman Bill Press urged Orange 
County Democrats to help "get rid of that cruel and that cold and that callous, 
incompetent and poor excuse for a governor named Pete Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
 Convention organizers said the convention should serve as a reminder to 
Democratic statewide candidates that Orange County should not be ignored -- 
that Democrats here can cut into the huge margins that statewide Republican 
candidates often rely on to carry them over the top.

SOUTHERN SECTION BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS; MATER DEI GETS WAKE-UP CALL, A 
SECTION TITLE; DIVISION I-A BOYS: RATHER THAN GET RUN OUT OF THE BUILDING, THE 
CHARGERS RUN OUT OF TIME AFTER STAGING A LATE RALLY. MONARCHS WIN, 65-59. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mater Dei's basketball team did what was expected Saturday night. It was 
Edison that did the unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs wrapped up what was already considered their Southern Section 
Division I-A boys' title at Anaheim Arena. But getting it took more of an 
effort than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei hung on for a 65-59 victory over Edison in front of 13,395 somewhat 
stunned fans. Everyone was expecting the Chargers to be run out of the 
building. Instead they only might have run out of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison charged back from 15 points down in the final five minutes. Twice the 
Chargers got to within four points in the final minute. Both times Miles Simon 
coolly sank a free throws to stave off what could have been one of the biggest 
upsets in Orange County high school basketball history. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei (31-0) came into the game ranked second in the nation by USA Today. 
Edison (19-10) had finished tied for fourth in the Sunset League. 
</P>
<P>
 But Simon made six of eight free throws in the final 49 seconds to prevent the 
shocker. 
</P>
<P>
 "In that situation, if we were going to lose, I wanted it to be my fault," 
said Simon, who scored 26 points. "I wanted the ball on the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Said center Shaun Jackson: "That's just Miles. He steps up in big games. He 
took over." 
</P>
<P>
 That the Monarchs needed saving stunned even themselves. There were a lot of 
long faces on the Mater Dei bench afterward even though they had won the 
school's ninth section title in 12 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Monarchs managed a smile or two, in between those sighs of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if we overlooked them, but we came out flat," Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Coach Gary McKnight: "Maybe we had an off night. Maybe it was Edison." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers had won seven consecutive games, including a league playoff game 
against Ocean View just to nail down the league's fourth automatic playoff 
berth. Edison defeated Century in overtime, upset third-seeded Orange and then 
rallied from 16 points to beat Palmdale in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 But that run was suppose to be stopped with authority by Mater Dei, which 
hadn't had a game closer than 18 points since beating Long Beach Poly by three 
in overtime in the final of the Tournament of Champions back in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Still . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether you're ranked No. 2 in country or where ever, once the kids get out 
on the court, they forget about that," Edison Coach Larry Hirst said. 
</P>
<P>
 It could have been a sound bite to keep his team's spirits up. But the 
Chargers bought it, hook, line and sinker. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei tried to pull away on several occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 A 12-3 run gave the Monarchs a 22-11 lead early in the second quarter and they 
led, 32-22, at halftime. Mater Dei shot 58% the first half. Simon made seven of 
10 shots and had 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Chargers wouldn't go away. They were four points behind with three 
minutes left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Beard (24 points) and Micah Kroeger (22 points) carried the Charger 
offense. At one point Beard even went head-to-head Schea Cotton, the Monarchs' 
6-foot-5 freshman. Beard ducked and faked, then hit a jump hook over a stunned 
Cotton. 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeger scored all of his points in the second half, including 13 in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon and Cotton (25 points) countered with jumpers, layups and dunks. But 
they couldn't bury the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon ignited a 12-2 run that gave Mater Dei a 53-38 lead with 4:17 left. It 
appeared over, to everyone but the Chargers. Kroeger and and Beard rallied 
Edison again, getting to 61-57 with 37 seconds left. But the Chargers couldn't 
get any closer.

SOUTHERN SECTION BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS; BREA-OLINDA TAKES SUSPENSE OUT OF 
WINNING; DIVISION III-AA GIRLS: LADYCATS EASILY GET THEIR SIXTH CONSECUTIVE 
SECTION TITLE WITH A 70-40 VICTORY OVER NEWPORT HARBOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 This was a forgone conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in November, when basketball practices officially began, everyone knew 
Brea-Olinda would win its sixth consecutive Southern Section title. The 
Ladycats were, after all, the three-time defending State champions and they had 
everyone back from last season's team. 
</P>
<P>
 The only mystery about this season's title was the victim and the margin of 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ladycats -- ranked second in the nation -- lived up to expectations with a 
70-40 victory over Newport Harbor Saturday at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd of 2,000 saw a game in which Nicole Erickson -- the Southern Section 
Division II player of the year last season -- was the weak link from the field, 
and still it wasn't close. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson shot an uncharacteristic four of 18 from the floor, but she found the 
open teammate, got eight rebounds, made Newport Harbor playmaker Gina Heads a 
non-factor, in addition to making things happen in other ways -- especially for 
her teammates: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sarah Beckley was eight of 13, and finished with 18 points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Colleen Hudson was seven of seven, and finished with 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lee Moulin was four of eight, including two of three from the three-point 
arc. She had 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
 And Erickson? Even in a slump, she scored 15 for the Ladycats (29-0). 
</P>
<P>
 "That says a lot about her," said first-year Brea Coach John Hattrup, who won 
two previous section titles at Mission Viejo. "A lot of other players would go 
in the tank. I see her with eight rebounds and five assists and contributing in 
other ways." 
</P>
<P>
 The game was won in the first quarter, when Brea took a 17-2 lead. Eight of 
the Ladycats' first 12 points came off offensive rebounds: Beckley's put-back 
made it 2-0; Moulin's made it 4-0; Hudson's made it 9-2; Beckley's made it 
12-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid that, Erickson hit a three-pointer. At the end of it, Hudson scored 
inside and Moulin made a 20-footer for a 17-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew if we continued to play well, we could score a lot of points," said 
Erickson of the first-quarter score.  
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor (22-7) was one of 12 from the field in the first quarter and 
was outrebounded, 15-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't shoot a very good percentage (29.5%)," Hattrup said, "but I would 
like to think we had something to do with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Brea's defense and big-game experience had everything to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids have been here before and we know what these games are like," 
Hattrup said. "If we have a good game plan and play hard, we know good things 
will happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The game plan centered on containing Newport Harbor's quickness outside, 
limiting their drives to the basket and holding the Sailors to one shot. Almost 
without exception, the Ladycats did that -- Newport Harbor had only two 
offensive rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor made 13 of 44 shots, but was only six of 25 in the first half 
and trailed, 36-14. Beckley had 12 points at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 The only Sailor who had any success was senior guard Genevieve Evarts, who 
scored a game-high 22 points. No one else made more than five, though each of 
the starters had averaged at least 7.9 points. Heads had five points. Dianne 
Pulido and Mandy Clayton had four. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came out very focused," said Beckley, who had nine of her 12 rebounds at 
halftime. "We knew we had to win this game to go to State."

MIKE PENNER: RAMS OWE FANS A FAVRE OR TWO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U nconventional wisdom of the day . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Brett Favre: What was that? A five-year, $20-million offer from the 
hold-the-dice, play-it-safe, bring-in-old-man-Moon Rams? Isn't that a kick in 
the stomach? Of course, it's a "conditional" offer, to quote John Shaw. Of 
course. Favre is a conditional quarterback, able to take you anywhere and 
everywhere in the course of four quarters -- from hair-raising touchdown bombs 
to hair-pulling interceptions. Sounds a little too close to you-know-who, but 
also consider that Favre is only 24, has played only three seasons, has gone 
from Atlanta's bench to the Pro Bowl to the NFC semifinals in those three 
seasons and has yet to blow out a knee, ankle, elbow or shoulder. If it was my 
team, I'd give Favre a shot, too, under one condition: He brings Sterling 
Sharpe with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Miller: He passes footballs. He passes physicals. The Rams are so 
excited they're prepared to give him a jersey with a red S on the chest. Memo 
to Rams: NFL season is 16 games long, not eight. If you bring in Miller, you 
better bring in Heath Shuler or Trent Dilfer, too. Someone has to play after 
Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Moon: Can you say Joe Namath, Bert Jones, Dan Pastorini and Steve 
Bartkowski? 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Chandler, Bubby Brister, David Krieg: Three more quarterback candidates 
the Rams are looking at. The question is: Why? Chandler backs up the 
quarterback the Rams should have signed last year, Steve Beuerlein. Brister has 
a pending offer from New Orleans, where he stands to back up a veteran backup, 
Wade Wilson. Krieg, an old Chuck Knox favorite, holds the NFL record for most 
career fumbles. He would have been something in the same backfield with 
Cleveland Gary. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmie Jones: Defensive tackle, played in back-to-back Super Bowls, could have 
been headed back for another, opts for big free-agent dollars instead, jumps to 
Rams. Did he consult Shane Conlan first? 
</P>
<P>
 Bo Jackson: The exhibition season-opening grand slam was only part of it. Bo's 
arrival in Anaheim is said to have helped thaw the frigid relationship between 
the Angels' front office and Mark Langston, who had refused to re-up until he 
was convinced the Angels were committed to winning something other than the 
Puniest Payroll In The American League sweepstakes. (And, by the way, 
congratulations on that, Jackie and Rich! The '94 trophy is yours!!) Then came 
Bo, then came Langston's signature on a three-year extension, which means the 
Angels can enter 1995 without a pitching rotation that reads "One day of Chuck 
and then we're. . . . um, not in very good shape." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bavasi: First he re-signs Langston, succeeding where Whitey Herzog could 
only curse and pound his fist. Then he makes his best player, Tim Salmon, rich 
and happy. Then he ties up his up-the-middle defense, shortstop Gary DiSarcina 
and center fielder Chad Curtis for the next three years. It's early, I know, 
but first impressions suggest that this Bavasi could be the most effective 
general manager the Angels have ever had. Backhanded compliment not intended. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay Vincent: That was some book proposal old Fay slapped together. Bud Selig 
is the "emblem of baseball's decline," Peter O'Malley "a nitwit," Bill White 
"incompetent" and George Steinbrenner "the most hated man in baseball." Now, 
Vincent says he's not writing the book because he's miffed that the proposal 
was leaked to the press. Which is a little like showing the kiddies 30 seconds 
of T. rex chomping on a jeep and then announcing you're canceling production on 
"Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Pigskin Classic: In which Fresno State is cast again as the big bad wolf of 
college football. Really now. Nebraska fears Fresno? With no Trent Dilfer and 
an all-new Bulldog offensive backfield? More likely, this was Tom Osborne 
arm-wrestling Athletic Director Bill Byrne and pinning Byrne's wrist to the 
table. Fact: Osborne coveted the job Byrne now holds. Fact: AD Byrne gets the 
Big Red face when he reaches a verbal agreement with the Pigskin Classic, only 
to have his football coach pull the rug out from under him. Nebraska may not 
play hockey, but it knows all about major-league power plays. 
</P>
<P>
 West Virginia: Osborne says he put it to a team vote. Want to play West 
Virginia in Anaheim? Huskers do. Want to play Fresno State? Huskers don't. A 
matchup of last year's two unbeatens, Nebraska and West Virginia, would have 
looked nice on the marquee, but that's about it. How many Mountaineer fans 
would have loaded up the truck and moved to Kat-ell-ee? As opposed to those 
ever-mobile Fresno Red Wavers -- 30,000 strong, have RVs, will travel? 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State: The plan, I hear, is to designate Fresno "Permanent Home Team" 
for the Pigskin Classic, the Freedom Bowl and any other college football game 
the OCSA decides to hold in the near or distant future. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big West Conference: Press release says the Big West will hold its annual 
post-season basketball tournament next weekend in Las Vegas. Apparently this 
means the Big West still plays basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jordan: He's no Bo. 
</P>
<P>
 Scottie Pippen: He's no Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago Bulls: Black, white, green or blue, they're all getting booed, and 
deservedly so, it seems to me. 
</P>
<P>
 John Candy: Long before the "Uncle Buck"s and the "Cool Runnings," he was the 
franchise player on the most brilliant comedy show ever televised, "SCTV." (If 
you don't remember, rent "The Last Polka," starring Candy as legendary polka 
meister Yosh Schmenge.) Candy was a good friend of Bruce McNall and could have 
played McNall in the now-inevitable TV movie, "Where Have All The Dollars 
Gone?" King home games, not the happiest place on earth these days, just got a 
little sadder.

TITANS CLOSE OUT SEASON ON WINNING NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Cal State Fullerton vs. Arkansas in the first round of the NCAA tournament? 
Hey, why not? 
</P>
<P>
 If there's one sure thing going into this week's Big West Conference 
Tournament, it's that every team is capable of losing on any given night, which 
bodes well for the Fullertons of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans closed the regular season Saturday with a 79-63 victory over UC 
Santa Barbara. They improved to 8-18, 6-12 in the Big West, assuring they'll 
finish ahead of last-place UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton will play Nevada -- a team the Titans have defeated twice this 
season -- at 3 p.m. Thursday in the first round of the tournament at Las Vegas' 
Thomas & Mack Center. 
</P>
<P>
 If Fullerton can get by the Wolf Pack, what is next? New Mexico State, the 
league champion who will take a five-game road losing streak into the 
tournament? Nevada Las Vegas, a team the Titans beat on the road? 
</P>
<P>
 Anything can happen in a conference where all the teams are equal. Fullerton 
is entering tournament play on a roll, which in the Big West, ranked 18th among 
conferences in the NCAA's recent Ratings Percentage Index, means you're playing 
better than .500 ball over the last seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is getting beat, which is a good sign for us," said junior forward 
Darren Little, who led the Titans with 20 points Saturday. "No one is killing 
anyone else, so if we play hard like we did tonight, if we play well, we can 
beat anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, it sounds like the usual rhetoric from a team trying to keep its hopes 
up entering the tournament, but you can't overestimate the Big West. In what 
other conference can you go 7 minutes 42 seconds of the second half without 
scoring, like the Titans did Saturday, and still maintain control of a game 
against a team ahead of you in the standings? 
</P>
<P>
 "We should be totally optimistic going into the tournament," Fullerton Coach 
Brad Holland said. "I hope the team goes in thinking we can go some ways, 
because it's wide open. Let's play our best and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans hardly played their best Saturday, but with the Gauchos playing one 
of their worst games of the season, it didn't matter. Santa Barbara (13-16, 
9-9) shot only 34.3% from the field, and when Fullerton went cold in the second 
half, leaving the door open for a Gaucho comeback, Santa Barbara failed to 
burst through. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans took a 63-47 lead on Winston Peterson's jump hook with 11:12 
remaining but didn't score again until Little's two free throws with 3:29 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gauchos went on a 9-0 run, well, it was more of a stroll -- it took them 
more than six minutes to score those nine points, and they were only able to 
pull to within seven, 63-56. That gave Fullerton time to recover. 
</P>
<P>
 Little followed his foul shots with a fast-break basket, and Fullerton 
outscored Santa Barbara, 12-5, in the final 2:40 to pull away. 
</P>
<P>
 "They played good defense, but we were shooting the ball too quickly and not 
getting it inside," Holland said of the scoring drought. "We need to work the 
ball into Peterson and (Fred) Amos." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson finished with 16 points and nine rebounds, and senior guard Greg 
Vernon had 13 points, eight assists and eight rebounds in the final home game 
of his four-year Fullerton career. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Robinson added 12 points and made two of two three-pointers for 
Fullerton, which had a season-low nine turnovers and shot a season-high 87.5% 
from the free-throw line (21 of 24). 
</P>
<P>
 So, what about a Titan-Razorback rematch? Remember, the teams met before, when 
Arkansas eliminated Fullerton's Miracle on Nutwood team in the national 
quarterfinals in 1978. If Fullerton somehow manages to win the Big West 
tournament, the Titans probably would be the 64th seed and would draw 
top-ranked Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be happy to take on that challenge," Holland said. "Anything can 
happen when you get into a post-season tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially in the Big West.

ANTEATERS CLOSE REGULAR SEASON WITH WHIMPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine, employing its very best stand-around offense and 
watch-them-run-and-dunk defense, ended the regular season with the weakest of 
whimpers Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters' death rattle was an embarrassing 91-72 defeat to Long Beach 
State in front of 2,849 in the Bren Center, an uninspired and lackluster 
performance, even for the last-place team in a mediocre conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time these teams met this season, it took two overtime periods to 
decide a winner. This one was over long before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine (7-19 overall and 4-14 in the Big West) often has been victim of its 
porous perimeter defense and the Anteaters allowed the 49ers to make five of 
their first six three-pointers. But that was a drop in the bucket compared to 
how many times Long Beach literally dropped the ball in the bucket. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 49ers' first 16 two-point baskets, 15 were either layups or dunks. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers (17-9, 11-7) led, 46-22, at halftime, turned that into a 55-23 rout 
in the first 3 1/2 minutes of the second half and it was garbage time after 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach will finish in either a three- or four-way tie for second in 
conference depending on the outcome of today's UNLV-Pacific game. But either 
way, the 49ers will be the third-seeded team in next week's Big West tournament 
at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-round seedings for the tournament were decided before the game 
began. Cal State Fullerton beat UC Santa Barbara on Saturday afternoon -- 
assuring the Anteaters of finishing in the cellar -- and Utah State beat 
Nevada. So 10th-seeded Irvine will meet No. 7 Santa Barbara at 1 p.m. Thursday 
and Fullerton (No. 9) will play Nevada (No. 8) at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think our guys understood that it didn't matter what we did tonight," 
Irvine Coach Rod Baker said. "We didn't tell them. But it was kind of a nothing 
game. And did nothing in it." 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers will take a good deal of confidence and momentum into the 
tournament. They have won six of their last seven and seven of the last nine. 
None of them were this easy, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first half was maybe our most complete 20 minutes we've played this year, 
in terms of just making good basketball plays," Long Beach Coach Seth Greenberg 
said. "I see a lot of growth in this team. Everyone understands their role and 
seems to be comfortable with their role. We're getting good leadership from 
(Brian) Camper and (Rod) Hannibal and we're playing good defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "But at media day (before the season) I talked about getting ready to play 
three days in March, so we've still got some work to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the teams played, Long Beach scored 111 points, but it took them 
50 minutes and Irvine scored 106. The 49ers reserves couldn't quite keep pace 
with the regulars, but there was plenty of running and gunning to go around for 
everybody in black and gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Five 49ers scored in double figures, led by forward James Cotton and center 
Terrance O'Kelley, who had 15 points each. Hannibal and Camper had 13 points 
apiece and Hannibal added eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just blowing us out, getting all those layups out of the transition 
game," Baker said. "I don't know if they were sending guys or guys were just 
releasing on their own, but we were looking at the back of their numbers all 
night." 
</P>
<P>
 Five Irvine seniors were honored before their last home game, but the two who 
start -- point guard Lloyd Mumford and center DeForrest Boyer -- didn't do much 
to inspire their teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Mumford got the so-much-for-senior-night treatment, and a seat on the bench, 
after an out-of-control drive in the opening minutes and played just five 
minutes in the first half. He finished with seven points, three assists and a 
turnover. Boyer also had seven points.

SOUTHERN SECTION BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS; OENNING MAKES HER MARK IN FINAL; 
DIVISION II-AA GIRLS: WOODBRIDGE SENIOR ENVISIONS A GREAT GAME AND SHE PRODUCES 
ONE, A 59-47 VICTORY OVER HEMET TO REMAIN UNDEFEATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jamie Oenning daydreamed about Saturday's championship and visualized the ball 
in her hands when the clock ticked down to zero. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the game, she thought about her coach, Eric Bangs, sitting in the 
stands the last time Woodbridge won a title -- it was 1991, the year Bangs took 
a one-year sabbatical. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the game, Oenning went to a blackboard and wrote for her teammates to 
see: "Play like a champion today." 
</P>
<P>
 And at tip-off, Oenning -- the only senior starter -- really got busy. She 
scored all of her seven points in the first quarter -- prompting a box-and-one 
defense that opened up the middle against Hemet's zone defense -- and had five 
steals as Woodbridge won for the 29th time without a loss, 59-47, over Hemet 
(21-6) in the Southern Section Division II-AA girls' championship Saturday in 
front of 1,300 at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda (29-0) is the only team in the Southern Section that can claim as 
many victories without a loss. The question: What's this team's legacy? 
</P>
<P>
 Bangs, with a 260-67 career record, considered it long and hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a classic team of components working together, having people with 
different skills that blend together," he said. "It just amazes me to be 29-0. 
There's a lot of good teams out there that can beat you on a given night. I 
guess it's just a team that wouldn't lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Oenning, the team's most valuable quote: "There is no better legacy than 
going undefeated and winning (the Southern Section)." 
</P>
<P>
 This victory was not without a challenge, though. Woodbridge made six of its 
first nine shots -- and led, 16-11, after one quarter. Erin Stovall's 17-footer 
preceded Hemet's 10-0 run. Trailing, 21-18, Woodbridge answered with nine in a 
row as part of a 12-2 run. At halftime, shooting 52% from the field (13 of 25), 
Woodbridge's lead remained five, 30-25. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemet's 6-0 run to open the third quarter gave the Bulldogs a 31-30 lead and 
was the first of eight consecutive lead changes. The third quarter ended with 
Woodbridge exploiting the inside in a 10-1 run -- four points by Melanie 
Pearson (16 points in the game) and Lisa Weaver (13 points) and two free throws 
by Angela Burgess (six points). 
</P>
<P>
 Stovall (13 points) banked in a drive from four feet to make it 48-38; the 
closest Hemet got after that was seven points. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Weaver had 13 points, mostly inside, in a reserve role. Woodbridge's 
reserves scored 17 points, and the Warriors got a terrific defensive 
performance from freshman Carly Moss against 5-foot-10 point guard Michelle 
Marshall (nine points, 4.5 off her average). 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't make a lot of mistakes and don't turn the ball over much," Hemet 
Coach Gregory Veatch said. "They'll be back next year, probably."

SOUTHERN SECTION BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS; GIMMICK DEFENSE TURNS TRICK FOR 
PACIFICA; DIVISION III-A BOYS: MARINERS USE 'TRIANGLE AND TWO' TO SHUT DOWN 
VEAL AND SAN DIMAS, 63-49. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the game, Pacifica Coach Bob Becker said he wouldn't use a gimmick 
defense to stop San Dimas star Jeremy Veal. But when Veal carved up his 
man-to-man pressure defense for 15 points in 18 minutes, Becker saw the 
Southern Section title slipping away. 
</P>
<P>
 So what did he do? What else -- go to a gimmick defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker called it a 'triangle and two." Veal wasn't sure what it was, he simply 
knew it had worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica (27-1) held Veal to four points the rest of the way and went on to a 
63-49 victory Saturday in the Southern Section Division III-A boys' final at 
Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once he hit that three-pointer from the top of the key, we decided we were 
going to double him," Becker said. "I didn't want that guy to have a heyday. We 
weren't going to give him anything open." 
</P>
<P>
 During the first half, Veal often found himself or his teammates open. If he 
wasn't slashing through the lane for a layup, he was slashing and dishing to 
center Jamar Bailey (15 points, 11 rebounds). 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the second half, Veal took his game outside and made a three-pointer 
and an 18-footer. But Becker called a timeout and put an end to Veal's field 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Veal, who committed eight turnovers, said he was baffled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought they were in a zone, but then I didn't know what they were in," he 
said. "All I know is I wasn't open anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica, meanwhile, scored 49 after a sluggish 14-point quarter. The Mariners 
never did get their three-point shooting game going -- they made only five of 
20 -- but they did get their vaunted press going. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica's press resembled Swiss cheese in the first half. It created few 
turnovers and several layups for San Dimas (24-5). But the constant pressure 
began to take a toll in the third quarter on a San Dimas team that used only 
six players. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bailey, who scored eight of his points in the first quarter: "We really 
didn't run our offense in the second half and we rushed our shots underneath." 
</P>
<P>
 First-year Coach Becker said he knew when San Dimas' six were spent. 
</P>
<P>
 "With 5:49 left in the third quarter, their guy couldn't get the ball 
inbounds," he said. "The referee got to four and they called timeout. I saw 
them walk to their bench and our guys ran to our bench. I knew right then that 
we were only going to get stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica's strongest all day was 6-foot-8 forward Jon Surface, who scored a 
game-high 23 points and grabbed five rebounds. Surface appeared to be the only 
Mariner who wasn't bothered by the unfamiliar shooting background, the crowd or 
the pressure.  
</P>
<P>
 "Jon overcame the big-game inexperience," Becker said. "I don't know if he 
even noticed the people in the stands." 
</P>
<P>
 As his teammates made two for 15 from three-point range, Surface made three of 
five. 
</P>
<P>
 Surface didn't do it all though. Forward Ramon Alliman missed all three of his 
three-point attempts, but he scored 11 points, had five rebounds and keyed 
Pacifica's 16-5 run in the third quarter that turned a five-point deficit into 
a 43-37 lead. The Mariners scored the fourth quarter's first six points and 
were never threatened again. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Chris Vlasic, Pacifica's leading three-point shooter, didn't have his 
radar working either as he fired three air balls from three-point range. But 
Vlasic still scored 19 points, had five rebounds and two steals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners' section title is their first in boys' basketball. Previously, 
Becker had coached Rancho Alamitos' girls' basketball team.

SOUTHERN SECTION BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS; SANTA MARGARITA DOMINATES SERVITE; 
DIVISION III-AA BOYS: FINNERANS AND A STINGY EAGLE DEFENSE KEEP FRIARS IN CHECK 
FOR 67-53 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There wasn't any fancy analysis of Santa Margarita's 67-53 thrashing of 
Servite in the Southern Section Division III-AA boys' basketball championship 
game Saturday at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just kicked our butts," Servite Coach Kevin Reynolds said. "We didn't 
bring our best game in here, but that's because they played so well and caused 
us to play like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles' stingy defense held Servite to 36% (17 of 47) shooting from the 
field. While the Friars missed their first seven shots, Santa Margarita scored 
the game's first 10 points and never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles (24-6) shot 57% from the field, out-rebounded Servite, and led by 
as many as 21 points in the third quarter to win the school's first Southern 
Section basketball title in front of a day-session crowd of 12,344. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Brad Finneran put on a show, scoring 26 points, including four dunks. 
But there were many contributors to Santa Margarita's basketball clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Finneran, Brad's twin brother who returned for the playoffs after 
suffering a broken foot, scored six points. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, he teamed with Brad to play a suffocating defense on the 
Friars' post players, David Downs and Mark Seaton. Seaton entered the game 
averaging 12 points, but managed only six points on seven shots. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Santa Margarita junior Brendan Mulligan, who had 16 points and four 
rebounds. He scored six points in the opening 4 1/2 minutes of the third 
quarter to help the Eagles take a 47-29 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was Eagle guard Brian Scoggin, who made two three-pointers in a 
52-second span to help Santa Margarita take a 10-0 lead 4 minutes 28 seconds 
into the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always wondered what it was like to win a big game like this," Santa 
Margarita Coach Jerry DeBusk said. "This is a good group of kids. I like being 
around them and we've really enjoyed the ride they've given us." 
</P>
<P>
 Servite didn't enjoy the ride Saturday as the Eagles opened the second quarter 
with a 7-0 run to expand the lead to 26-12. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been down by eight points in the playoffs and came back," Reynolds 
said. "But we did not respond well when we were facing a 13- to 15-point 
deficit. Man, when Santa Margarita sees a weakness, they pounce on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Downs, who had 17 points on five-of-11 shooting from the field, scored eight 
in the second quarter and helped cut the lead to 33-23 with 22 seconds 
remaining the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Derek Yankoff made an acrobatic tip-in with two seconds remaining to push 
the lead to 12 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Brad Finneran opened the floodgates. 
</P>
<P>
 He made four of five shots in the third quarter and his no-look, 
over-the-shoulder flip pass to Brian for a fast-break layup brought the Santa 
Margarita fans to their feet. The basket gave the Eagles a 47-29 lead with 3:15 
remaining in quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Two minutes later, Brad stole an errant pass and flew in for a dunk. With 48 
seconds remaining in the third quarter, he scored on a layup to make it, 53-32. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristian Vallas, who had 17 points for Servite, made his fourth three-pointer 
to cut the lead to 56-43. Kieran Betts scored on a layup to make it 58-47 with 
3:48 remaining, but the Friars drew no closer.

SOUTHERN SECTION BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS; WOODBRIDGE'S WEAVER MAKES GOOD ON 
PROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Lisa Weaver rocked in her chair and shook her legs as she waited, impatiently, 
for her cue. 
</P>
<P>
 Her confidence soaring from recent success, Weaver, a junior, was eager to 
enter the Southern Section Division II-AA girls' championship game. The 
Woodbridge reserve forward believed that she could provide the spark to help 
Woodbridge overpower Hemet. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver promised herself that if her opportunity came, it would not go wasted. 
</P>
<P>
 Promise kept. 
</P>
<P>
 Propelled partly by Weaver's lift, Woodbridge defeated Hemet, 59-47, to claim 
the division title Saturday at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver (5 feet 11) scored 13 points and grabbed seven rebounds. She was at her 
best in the first half, leading all scorers at halftime with nine points. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for a player who entered the game averaging roughly five points. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always my goal to come off the bench and give the team a lift," Weaver 
said. "I play behind some great players, so it makes me feel good when I can 
come in and help them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't always work out that way, but I'm happy it did today." 
</P>
<P>
 Warrior Coach Eric Bangs is equally pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was one of the stories of the game," Bangs said. "She did a great job 
finding the 'sweet spot' open in their zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver's impact was especially valuable to Woodbridge -- and damaging to Hemet 
-- because of Warrior center Angela Burgess' foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess, who entered the game averaging 13.3 points, was ineffective thanks to 
three first-half fouls. She finished with only six points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lisa doesn't mind mixing it up in there," Bangs said. "We needed her to come 
in and score, but we also needed defense and rebounding inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "She gave us all of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Hemet Coach Gregory Veatch admired the performance, too, albeit reluctantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had (Burgess) in foul trouble, so we were feeling pretty good about that, 
and then (Weaver) goes and plays a great game," Veatch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what it takes to win (a section) championship. One kid stepping up and 
playing a super game."

SOUTHERN SECTION BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS; PACIFICA'S ALLIMAN USES MODEST 
NUMBERS TO PRODUCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Pacifica's basketball team, out-fought, out-muscled and out-hustled in the 
paint, turned to its dominant inside force Saturday. So what if he's only 6 
feet 1? 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Alliman did not disappoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Alliman, a senior, pushed, shoved and soared in the second half to help the 
Mariners defeat San Dimas, 63-49, in the Southern Section Division III-A boys' 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Alliman finished with 11 points -- 10 in the second half -- and five rebounds. 
Modest numbers, but most came at important moments. 
</P>
<P>
 He scored six points in an 11-3 third-quarter run that gave the Mariners a 
38-35 lead. More importantly, was where he was doing the damage -- inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach said we had to pick it up inside," Alliman said. "If we did, good 
things were going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Alliman has been creating good things with his inside play all season. His 
ability allows Jon Surface (6-8) and Chris Vlasic (6-5) to play on the 
perimeter, safe in the knowledge that their size will not be missed down low. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's 6-1, but he has a 6-8 heart," first-year Coach Bob Becker said. "That, 
and his 32-inch vertical leap, make him difficult to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 That trait wasn't obvious at first glance to Becker. He had Alliman pegged as 
a guard. Then he saw Alliman play. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's hungry when he gets inside," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners needed that desire Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 San Dimas had owned the inside in the first half. The Saints had a 21-11 edge 
in rebounds. They had nine offensive rebounds, which led to six points. 
</P>
<P>
 San Dimas led, 27-25, at halftime. In stepped Alliman. He scored on an 
offensive rebound to start the second half and the Mariners were off and 
running. 
</P>
<P>
 Alliman scored eight points in the quarter, four on offensive rebounds. He had 
three offensive rebounds in the quarter and four for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Alliman scored on a layup to give Pacifica a 36-35 lead with 3 minutes 56 
seconds left in the quarter. A moment later, he grabbed an offensive rebound 
and scored for a 38-35 lead. Pacifica never trailed again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ramon is the reason we won this game," Becker said.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Alliman: "I love going against bigger guys. They're slow. I kill them 
with my quickness. That gives me a charge." 
</P>
<P>
 And, on Saturday, that charge gave the Mariners a jump start.

PREP ROUNDUP; WRIGHT THROWS NO-HITTER, HITS TWO HOMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jaret Wright threw a no-hitter to lead Katella to a 7-1 victory over Laguna 
Hills in the second round of the Loara Diamond baseball tournament. Wright, who 
struck out 11 and walked only two, also had two home runs and four runs batted 
in for the Knights. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Loara Diamond tournament second-round championship bracket games: 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda 6, Long Beach Jordan 1 -- Bryan Robinson had a perfect game 
through 6 1/3 innings and settled for the one-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond Bar 4, Dana Hills 2 -- Johnny Schmidt's two-run home run in the sixth 
gave Diamond Bar (2-0) the lead. Dana Hills' Chris Toomey also hit a two-run 
homer. 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado 14, Newbury Park 6 -- Jeff Moore had two doubles, and Chris Beck had 
three singles for El Dorado (2-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley 4, Kennedy 3 -- Luke Fox's single tied the score, and Kevin 
Burford's fielder's choice won it for Fountain Valley (2-0) in a three-run 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 6, Villa Park 5 -- Winning pitcher Eric Sobek (1-0) was also three for 
four with a two-run triple in the first inning for Irvine (2-0).

FOR HIRST, MAGIC SLIPS AWAY AT THE END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before Saturday's Southern Section Division I-A boys' basketball championship 
game against Mater Dei, Edison Coach Larry Hirst begged for a chance to be in 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we can stay close," Hirst said. "And maybe, if we can make a play at 
the end, pull off an upset." 
</P>
<P>
 To the surprise of the 13,395 fans at Anaheim Arena, Edison made Mater Dei 
sweat for its 65-59 victory, and closed to within four points -- twice -- in 
the final 49 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Four was the magic number for the Chargers, because they remembered Micah 
Kroeger's magical four-point play, which helped them reach the Southern Section 
basketball finals for the first time in the school's history. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second round against Century, Edison trailed by four in the final 
minute when Kroeger made a three-pointer, and was fouled. He made the free 
throw, the game went into overtime, and the Chargers survived with a 58-57 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no magical shot this night. Mater Dei's Miles Simon made six of 
eight free throws in the final 49 seconds, and Kroeger's half-court shot at the 
buzzer would have only sliced the deficit in half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not happy with just being invited," Hirst said. "All week long we 
thought we could win this game. Even though we were down 15 points in the 
fourth quarter, the kids believed." 
</P>
<P>
 Edison players such as Ben Beard, who had 24 points, and Kroeger, who had 22, 
made Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight a believer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're ranked No. 2 in the nation by USA Today, then Edison has to be a 
top-five team," McKnight said. "We were sluggish tonight, but Edison had a lot 
to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 McKnight isn't alone in his praise for Hirst. 
</P>
<P>
 Hirst's former coach at Edison, Dave Mohs, was one of four former Edison 
coaches on hand to watch the Chargers in their first title game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun watching one of your ex-players lead the team," Mohs said. "Sure, 
you're proud of what he's accomplished, but I had nothing to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Borchert, who coached Edison last season but is on a sabbatical from 
basketball, echoed Mohs sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very proud of the kids, they're a great bunch," Borchert said. "I'm very 
pleased with what Larry's done for the program. This is his team and his 
season."

EVARTS DOESN'T GIVE UP WHEN SAILORS ARE DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only a few seconds remained in an exhausting, unpleasant experience for the 
Newport Harbor High girls' basketball team Saturday, but Genevieve Evarts did 
not seem cognizant of the time factor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors were deep into the process of being routed by Brea-Olinda, 70-40, 
in the Southern Section Division III-AA girls' championship game at Cal Poly 
Pomona, yet there was Evarts, a senior guard, running, jumping and maintaining 
a frantic pace on defense. Even as the final buzzer sounded, Evarts remained in 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who expected something to the contrary does not understand Evarts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, we were down, but I wasn't going to give up," Evarts said. "I figured, 
'Well, we're here, let's make the best of it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sailor Coach Shannon Jakosky: "I wouldn't expect anything less from her 
and she wouldn't expect anything less from herself." 
</P>
<P>
 Evarts (5 feet 7) provided some shining moments for Newport Harbor in an 
otherwise bleak performance against the state's top-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
 She scored a game-high 22 points, or 55% of the Sailors' total. Evarts was 
seven of 13 from the field (54%), which was really an accomplishment because 
the rest of the Sailors made only six of 31 shots (19.3%) against the Ladycats' 
swarming half-court defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda outscored Newport Harbor, 17-2, in the first quarter. Although 24 
minutes of basketball remained, the game was simply another Brea-Olinda victory 
waiting to become official. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised by the way we came out," said Evarts, the Sailors' leading 
scorer with an average of 15.8 points entering the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was difficult to run what we planned on running. We didn't really give 
ourselves a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Evarts showed that she can hold her own against the best. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to outscoring standout Ladycat guard Nicole Erickson (15 points), 
she also had three steals. Her final steal led to a play that typified her 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading, 67-29, with 2 minutes 3 seconds left to play, Brea-Olinda forced 
Newport Harbor to commit a turnover. But Evarts stole the ball back, maneuvered 
through defenders and drove along the baseline for a layup. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda Coach John Hattrup was among those impressed by Evarts' relentless 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a great player," Hattrup said. "Any time a player can shoot and drive 
the way she can, they're going to give you trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plus, she is real smart. You don't get to a (section) final without having 
players like her." 
</P>
<P>
 So after three seasons of helping her team qualify for at least the division 
semifinals, Evarts' desire for a section championship will go unfulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor's season, however, will continue if the Sailors earn an 
at-large berth in the Southern California Regional of the State Division III 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 And although Evarts would have understandably preferred a more favorable 
outcome for Newport Harbor, she still has much to remember fondly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We overcame a big hurdle just to get to this game," she said. "I'm happy I 
had the chance to go this far."

SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION II GIRLS' SOCCER; ESPERANZA'S TITLE HOPES ARE 
DERAILED IN THE FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON CLIFFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Esperanza girls' soccer team had been winning games it wasn't supposed to 
throughout this postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs beat second-seeded El Modena, 1-0, in the quarterfinals and beat 
third-seeded Ventura Buena, 4-3, on penalty kicks in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 But all hope of a sweep of the top seeds came to an end Saturday afternoon, 
when Torrance Bishop Montgomery beat the Aztecs, 1-0, at Cerritos Gahr High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-seeded Knights were in the final for the first time since 1986, when 
current Coach Kit Schwartzman scored the game-winning goal to beat Arcadia, 
1-0. The Aztecs reached the final for the first time since 1988, when they lost 
to Buena, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza stayed with the Knights throughout most of the first half, but had 
several defensive lapses, which kept the Aztecs on defense for most of the 
final minutes of the half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights struck first, 10 minutes into the game. After a goal was waved off 
for an illegal throw-in, the Knights again had a chance with a throw-in from 
the left corner. 
</P>
<P>
 The same play worked to perfection this time, the ball glancing off the head 
of senior halfback Rachel Moseley past Esperanza goalkeeper Suzanne Benet and 
into the upper right part of the net. The goal was Moseley's 14th of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza's best chance to score in the opening half came about five minutes 
later when freshman midfielder Michelle Schardin had a breakaway shot against 
Bishop Montgomery goalkeeper Celeste Adams. Schardin missed the left side of 
the net by less than a foot, preserving the shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights missed on several opportunities late in the half, settling for a 
one-goal halftime lead.  
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza turned the tables early in the second half, but couldn't convert on 
two opportunities in the first three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights' leading scorer, Michelle Kallas, nearly added to her team-high 23 
goals on a breakaway. Benet charged Kallas, forcing her to kick left, just 
missing the corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza's final chances came in the final 10 minutes. The Aztecs, however, 
couldn't convert on three consecutive breakaways and a fourth chance was 
snubbed when Jenny Parkison's pass to a breaking Tammy Lyon ended up in the 
hands of Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 "On almost everyone of our breakaways, we had a freshman behind the ball," 
Esperanza Coach Phyllis Scarborough said. "Experience was the difference in the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs were without junior fullback Amy Harris, who received a red card in 
the game against Buena. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were without one of our stoppers," Scarborough said. "I think they did as 
well a job as they could have out there. We were really hurting."

CIF STATE WRESTLING CHAMPIONSHIPS; CALVARY CHAPEL SETS RECORD FOR POINTS, WINS 
SECOND TITLE IN ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel, the high-powered and high-profile wrestling team has 
unwittingly added another P to their creed of practice, perseverance and 
prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressure. And those expectations helped contribute to some uncharacteristic 
surprises as the Eagles flexed their way to a second consecutive State 
wrestling title Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel dominated the two-day meet to the point that the Eagles had the 
championship wrapped up before the final round began, and the sold-out crowd at 
the University of Pacific's Spanos Center felt the gritty little Christian 
school was getting greedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel sent eight wrestlers to State and three to the finals, where 
all won individual titles. The performances of State champions Shane Valdez 
(119), Josh Holiday (145) and Ed Mosley (152) helped the Eagles' score a 
State-record 121.5 points. Runner-up Moreno Valley Canyon Springs produced 81.5 
points and two champions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Calvary Chapel never won the fans' hearts. After defending State champion 
Dane Valdez -- the heavy favorite to add the 125 pound ribbon to last year's 
119 -- was upset in the morning semifinals, they roared their approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The exercise was repeated during the championship, when brother Shane Valdez 
won the 119 title but was booed for his defensive stance. After three 
consecutive runner-up finishes at 112, the Oklahoma-bound senior ended the 
drought with a 5-4 victory over Tommy Montoya of Baldwin Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of upset me," Shane said of the reaction. "But it didn't really 
matter. I got what I wanted. I was so nervous, I kept trying to relax myself, 
but I couldn't, so I didn't attack. I was on the defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Newly crowned divisional champions Darryl Christian (140) of Canyon and Juan 
Alvarez (135) of El Modena were more aggressive in victory. Together, they 
helped Orange County, with five champions, to its best State finish ever. 
</P>
<P>
 But Christian, who won two State titles in Oregon and has dominated his class 
since his arrival in California, wasn't fully satisfied. Christian, who 
defeated Edison's Alfred Frausto, 10-4, had hoped to wrestle top-ranked Moises 
Perez of Madera. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I heard about was Perez this, Perez that," said second-ranked Christian. 
"I would have liked to meet him. You know, No. 1 and 2, head to head. A win 
feels better when you've done your best." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Christian wasn't initially elated, the joy of a third State title 
should soon sink in. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take long for victory's significance to hit Alvarez, an 11-9 winner 
over George Mercado of Oak Grove. Or his coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Juan wrestled a great match, all his hard work this year paid off," El Modena 
Coach Alan Clinton said. It was the Vanguards' first State champion since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 En route to breaking the existing team record of 117.5 points set by Fresno 
Clovis West in 1984, Calvary Chapel could have broken it by more. But the 
Eagles were docked 11 points for a flagrant misconduct penalty and a 
unsportsmanlike conduct call, or it would have fallen before finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel boasts four Southern Section titles in row and now two 
California crowns and did it with a program started five years ago by Azevedo, 
a 1980 Olympian and former NCAA champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had our ups and downs," he said. "We made some mistakes, but I think we 
put a lot of pressure on ourselves from the beginning. It's nice to defend the 
title." 
</P>
<P>
 The twin Valdez brothers were attempting to become the first brothers to win 
State titles since Merced High's Adam and Dan Cuestas did it in 1977. But 
Canyon Springs' Norman (103) and Stephen (112) Abs did it instead. Wrestling 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In a short presentation before the finals, Calvary Chapel Coach John Azevedo 
was named the national high school wrestling coach of the year by U.S. 
Wrestling.

SOUTHERN SECTION BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS; BELLFLOWER ST. JOHN BOSCO WINS II-A 
TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY BAUM

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jelani Gardner, a 6-foot-6 senior point guard, scored 12 of his 24 points in 
the fourth quarter to carry No. 6-ranked Bellflower St. John Bosco to a 55-54 
victory over No. 3 Compton Dominguez High in the Southern Section Division II-A 
championship Saturday at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to throw everything at him we could and get the ball out of his 
hands," Dominguez Coach Russell Otis said. 
</P>

PREP BASEBALL 1994 / SMALL SCHOOLS; ST. MARGARET'S POWELL IS NOW THE ROLE MODEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joey Powell turned and shook his head in disgust as he watched the baseball 
roll farther away. 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Margaret's High freshman had misplayed yet another line drive during a 
Tartan practice before the 1991 season. As if the neophyte outfielder didn't 
have enough with which to cope. 
</P>
<P>
 He was insecure about his ability and wondered if he really had a shot at 
earning a position on the varsity, or whether he was being kept around only for 
practice purposes. The Tartans had a senior-dominated team, and Powell was 
trying hard not to attract attention. 
</P>
<P>
 That became harder each time a ball hit him in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was real nervous and I was trying too hard to have the guys accept me," 
Powell said. "I was walking on eggshells and making stupid mistakes, so I just 
decided to start relaxing and let everything happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Good move. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Powell is a senior All-Academy League outfielder. A four-year starter, 
Powell now watches the other guys try to fit in -- and helps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really proud that I've started for four years," Powell said. "There were 
a lot of times I doubted myself when I was a freshman, but I got through it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things have become a little bit better every year." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell's increasing comfort zone has coincided with improved play. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the self-doubts, he was selected all-league honorable mention as a 
freshman and the Tartans won the league title. He was a member of the second 
team as a junior and completed the trifecta last season when he was named to 
the first team. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell batted .340 with two home runs and 14 runs batted in. What's more, St. 
Margaret's won the league title for the second time in his three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a great, natural stroke," Tartan Coach Mike Hays said. "You could see 
it when he was a freshman and it has improved every year." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, however, is at his best in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 He has played each outfield position and is equally adept at them all. Powell 
possesses the speed to track down balls in the gaps and has a strong arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been our leader in the outfield since his sophomore year," Hays said. 
"He knows what every outfielder is supposed to do and he's always making sure 
the other guys are set. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone relies on him because they know he'll make the correct play." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell excels at relay throws. Hays said he always hits the cutoff man 
perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hold a lot of runners because his throws are right on the money," Hays 
said. "There are at least a half a dozen times each year when he makes a play, 
a key play, that stops a runner from taking a base or scoring." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell works with the younger outfielders throughout the season, stressing 
fundamentals. He also encourages them in the same manner he was once encouraged 
by veteran players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a lot more responsibility the last couple of seasons and I like 
that," he said. "I always try to help teach the freshmen and sophomores the 
team game because that's important. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always try to get everyone to catch the ball with both hands and get down 
in front of balls, stuff that seems real simple but that can really hurt you if 
you don't do it right."

PREP BASEBALL 1994 / SMALL SCHOOLS; REILAND EXPERIMENT IS A SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Reiland sheepishly raised his right hand and stepped forward on the 
Orange Lutheran High baseball field after hearing the question repeated in a 
tone of displeasure. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Lancers' initial practice last February, first-year Coach Jeff 
Pressman twice asked his charges who among them had experience catching. 
Reiland was the lone Lancer to respond -- and he wishes he hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
 His experience behind the plate was limited to a couple of seasons in Little 
League, when baseball was equally important as cartoons and candy. Moreover, he 
wasn't especially good then . 
</P>
<P>
 But with no other options, Pressman converted the junior third baseman. It 
wasn't pretty. 
</P>
<P>
 More baseballs reached backstops than Reiland's mitt during the first few 
games. And as for baserunners . . . well, Reiland watched several opponents go 
from first to second without the ball ever leaving his often-trembling right 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Things got so bad that Pressman considered scrapping the experiment after only 
a few test flights. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just terrible at first . . . terrible," Pressman said. "But he never 
gave up and he put in the time to learn what he needed and fix his mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "His development and dedication really helped to stabilize our team. He was a 
big reason we had the season we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Lutheran finished second in the Olympic League, largely because of its 
rookie behind the mask, who earned second-team all-league honors. The Lancer 
senior who formerly despised catching now revels in his role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad I stuck with it," Reiland said, "but at times it was really hard." 
</P>
<P>
 The first few weeks of last season were the toughest of Reiland's life. His 
play at catcher affected his hitting, which in turn, affected every aspect of 
his psyche. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball was suddenly as much fun as midterms. 
</P>
<P>
 "During one of our first games, I was picked off from third twice and thrown 
out at the plate," Reiland said. "A bunch of guys stole on me and I was making 
all kinds of mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really getting down inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Reiland considered giving up. But he was all the Lancers had and he didn't 
want to quit on his teammates -- or himself. 
</P>
<P>
 So he worked with Orange Lutheran's coaching staff long after his teammates 
left practice for home, learning the position and reinventing himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to change my attitude," Reiland said. "I decided to really get into 
catching, but I still had to learn a lot about the position. 
</P>
<P>
 "I basically had to have the position taught to me because I hadn't played it 
since Little League, so I was learning every game." 
</P>
<P>
 Reiland learned quickly. By the time league play began, he started becoming 
comfortable. The main indicator was his success throwing out runners. 
</P>
<P>
 He nailed around 30% during the season -- and about 40% in league games. 
Reiland also showed major improvement in other technical aspects of catching, 
such as blocking the plate and stopping balls thrown in the dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my attitude was something that helped us," Reiland said. "Nobody 
really wanted to catch, so when I did it and worked hard, I think everyone 
appreciated it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If everyone has a good attitude, it helps the team play at a higher level." 
</P>
<P>
 Reiland also did the job when standing at the plate. Batting cleanup, he hit 
.316 with one home run and 17 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 He has bigger plans this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've set a lot of goals," Reiland said. "I learned a lot last year and now I 
want to improve on it."

 Hays has high expectations for this season's team -- and with good reason. "I 
think this could be the best team I've had in my four years here," Hays said. 
"We have an experienced pitching staff and good bats." Powell and Rodriguez are 
St. Margaret's leaders. Powell, a four-year starter who plays every outfield 
position, batted .340 with 14 runs batted in and was a first-team all-league 
selection. Rodriguez, another first-team all-league pick, batted .450 and threw 
out 77% of baserunners in league play, Hays said. Rodriguez also had 16 stolen 
bases. "Those two guys have been great for us," Hays said. "They really make 
things happen." Miller is St. Margaret's top pitcher. He was 5-1 and 3-0 in 
league play last season. Kelley and Masters also are expected to battle for 
jobs in the rotation. SCHEDULE

COMMUNITY COLLEGE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL; GOLDEN WEST'S SEASON ENDS IN LOSS AT 
STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Golden West ended its season the same way it started -- with a loss to Los 
Angeles Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Saturday's 83-70 loss came in the women's State championship basketball 
game at Solano College in Suisun City. 
</P>
<P>
 LaTasha Burnett, the tournament's most valuable player, scored 28 points and 
had 10 rebounds for Los Angeles Harbor (31-6). 
</P>
<P>
 JoAnn Williams scored 36 points, including six three-pointers, for Los Angeles 
Harbor, which led, 41-35, at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Kravik had 14 points and Kristin Brun added 11 points and nine 
rebounds for Golden West, which was making its eighth consecutive State 
tournament appearance. The Rustlers won titles in 1990 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Brun, a sophomore guard, led the Rustlers in rebounding in all three game. She 
and Julie Murdent were selected to the all-tournament team. Murdent, who had 13 
points, was the second-leading scorer in the tournament with 61 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West, the Orange Empire Conference champion, ends its season 33-5. The 
Rustlers lost to L.A. Harbor, 68-65, Nov. 12 in the season opener for both 
teams.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE MEN'S BASKETBALL; SADDLEBACK SLOWS DOWN IN LATE GOING, FALLS, 
72-66 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Saddleback, which had several chances in the final minute, failed to convert 
any of them and lost to host Long Beach, 72-66, Saturday in a men's basketball 
regional final. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (29-6) advanced to the State tournament, which starts Thursday at 
UC Irvine. The loss marks the third consecutive season Saddleback has been 
beaten in a regional final. The Gauchos end their season, 23-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Tes Whitlock made two free throws with 1 minute 31 seconds left to cut Long 
Beach's lead to 69-66, but Saddleback never scored again. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach's Marc Neal and Kevin Beal then missed shots and Saddleback's 
Antoine Jefferson got the rebound with 57 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 After a timeout, Derrick Walsh drove to the basket but had the ball stripped 
by Long Beach's Marcus Woods with 45 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Saddleback had a chance when Long Beach's Robert Darville missed the 
front end of a one-on-one with 27 seconds left. But Long Beach's Woods, the 
shortest player on the court, got the long rebound, allowing the Vikings to 
retain possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback fouled Beal with 18 seconds left and he made the first free throw 
to put Long Beach ahead, 70-66. He missed the second but Darville got the 
rebound and was fouled. He made both free throws with 10 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big difference was we couldn't come up with the big rebound at the end," 
Saddleback Coach Bill Brummel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams were tied at 33 at the half but Saddleback, led by Jefferson, held 
the advantage early in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 He scored Saddleback's first 12 points and the Gauchos were ahead, 45-37, with 
14:55 left. Saddleback led, 55-47, with 10:02 left when Eric Ambrozich made a 
short jumper. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach then switched to a full-court press and the Gauchos started to 
struggle. Long Beach finally caught Saddleback at 61, with 4:38 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Blanton made a jumper from the free-throw line to give Long Beach a 
63-61 lead with 3:50 left. Saddleback was never tied or in the lead again. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson finished with 21 points and nine rebounds and Whitlock added 17 and 
Walsh 15 for Saddleback.

ONE BIG GLORIOUS BAZAAR; THE MARKETS AND STREET VENDORS OF ISTANBUL HELP DEFINE 
THIS VIVID CITY, WHERE IDEAS AND GOODS HAVE BEEN TRADED FREELY FOR CENTURIES

 ISTANBUL SMELLS OF HONEY AND WOOL, COFFEE and pistachios, newsprint and fried 
mackerel. It smells of luxury and necessity, of salt, canvas, tar and gasoline. 
Istanbul smells of commerce.Istanbul is the only city astride two continents. 
Asia and Europe are both joined and separated by the Bosporus, the strait whose 
currents flow through Istanbul in two directions -- a warm, northward thrust up 
from the Mediterranean by way of the Sea of Marmara and a colder, less salty 
flow south from the Black Sea. Like the fish that have sustained many 
generations of Istanbullus (as the city's residents call themselves), ideas, 
languages and ambitions -- and mercantile goods of every description -- have 
also swirled through this conduit. 
</P>
<P>
 The first city on the site, Byzantium, was a modest Greek trading colony that 
languished under Rome. Under the Emperor Constantine, though, it became the 
great Eastern Roman capital of Constantinople. Constantinople's language was 
Greek, its law Roman, its state religion Christianity. We call its epoch, art 
and intrigues Byzantine , after Byzas, legendary founder of that initial Greek 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Constantinople became the most populous and prosperous city of the medieval 
world. Trade in hides, wine, frankincense and grain was matched by a traffic in 
doctrines. Theological hairsplitting provided as much employment as the 
mercantile fleets. Franciscan monks set up shop here in the 13th Century, while 
St. Francis was still alive. In 1204, the Fourth Crusade -- Roman Catholic 
armies funded by Venetian merchant bankers -- sacked this capital of Eastern 
Orthodoxy, which was a juicier, more pluckable plum than distant Jerusalem, in 
the clutches of infidel Arabs. By the time the Ottoman Turks captured 
Constantinople in 1453, it had become a depopulated and demoralized shadow of a 
city. They named their dingy diamond Istanbul, from the Greek phrase eis ten 
polin , meaning "to the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Within 100 years, a Muslim Istanbul was again a booming cosmopolis, where a 
score of nationalities and sizable communities of Christians and Jews (refugees 
from the Spanish Inquisition) all traded with each other and the rest of the 
world. Caravans brought slaves from Africa and the Caucasus, spices and jewels 
from India, furs and amber from Russia, silver and gold from the New World, 
foodstuffs from around the Mediterranean, cloth from Venice and Samarkand. The 
famous Silk Road led here. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Istanbul is a sprawling, chaotic agglomeration of peoples and purposes, 
astonishingly rich in art and architecture, a quintessential city, a sifter of 
risk and reward. The worst thing I can say about it is that it's locked in 
mortal combat with the automobile, the cancer of modern economic growth. But 
above the traffic, you can still hear peddlers hawking artichokes and melons, a 
muezzin's call to prayer, church bells, the melancholy notes of a tavern 
zither. The evening skyline of domes and minarets, crescents, crosses and 
dockyard cranes epitomizes the continuum of spiritual and secular endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
 For all its pulsating neon, Istanbul still has a human heartbeat. The pleasure 
of the smallest errand or transaction always makes me thankful to be here. "May 
your cough be gone," says a bank teller, insisting that I share her herbal tea; 
a boy refuses a tip for carrying heavy parcels; a taxi driver begins a $2 ride 
with the supplication, "In the name of God, the Compassionate and the 
Merciful." This is my idea of civility -- of civilization -- a place where you 
can wear your jewelry, drink the water, eat the arugula. Even the fax machines 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Can there be any comprehensible introduction, for the first-time visitor to 
Istanbul, to a city stretching over so much time and space? Too many visitors 
end up merely awestruck -- and exhausted -- by the city's museums and 
architectural riches. It's almost impossible here to know which way to turn, 
which roads to take. Clearly, a plan or guiding principle is called for -- and 
I have a suggestion as to what it might be. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time I return to Istanbul, I visit its markets to get my bearings. And 
every time I show the city to friends, I like to take them on a walking tour 
that focuses on trade -- on markets, street sellers, vast bazaars. My aim is to 
present Istanbul as the unabashedly commercial nexus that it is. After all, it 
is the "pursuit of piastres," to quote the Encyclopaedia Britannica, that has 
fueled centuries of artistic patronage in this gilded city. Of course, the 
route I follow -- through the European portion of the city -- is incidentally 
studded with splendid edifices, evocative vistas, delicious snacks and quirky 
detours. Istanbul's markets seem to touch every other part of the city as well 
-- which, of course, is the point. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's begin with a glass of freshly squeezed pomegranate juice on the sidewalk 
in Taksim Square while taking a moment to familiarize ourselves with the city's 
internal geography. You and Taksim Square are in the center of the Beyoglu 
district, full of garlanded Beaux-Arts apartments and soaring hotels. The 
Golden Horn, a scimitar-shaped inlet of the Bosporus, separates Beyoglu from 
Stamboul, the old city where most of Istanbul's Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman 
monuments are located. 
</P>
<P>
 Off the square runs Istiklal Cadessi, a bustling thoroughfare newly closed to 
all but emergency vehicles and a quaint tram shuttling along a central track. 
Istanbul is a city for those who delight in detail, from the tiny Ottoman stone 
birdhouses on the northwest corner of Istiklal to the modern retail vitrines 
festooned with bolts of Italian silks, English pin stripes and Turkish mohair 
in shops along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Cane baskets on long ropes dangle from side-street balconies amid the fading 
signboards of Greek furriers and Sephardic milliners. Tugs and cries allow 
upper-story residents to consummate transactions with egg or yogurt sellers 
down below. Virtually any comestible -- from hot kebabs to watermelons cradled 
in hammocks of old sheets -- may be hauled up. 
</P>
<P>
 Halfway down Istiklal, the Cicek Pasaji, or Passage of Flowers, gives way to a 
fish market. Trying to sell you a glistening turbot or giant shrimp from the 
Syrian coast, the fishmongers look genuinely crushed when you confess that 
you're staying in a hotel, without kitchen facilities. Mingling with the 
seafood sellers are a score of delicatessens selling olives, cheese and comb 
honey; an herbalist (the only source I know in Istanbul for tofu), and a 
restaurant that specializes in tripe soup, an essential hangover cure for 
habitues of the nearby beer halls. 
</P>
<P>
 Academic publishers and antiquarian bookstores cluster around the bottom of 
Istiklal. Atop the steep alley of Galip Dede is Librarie de Pera, a 
multilingual bookshop that also holds auctions of rare volumes and ephemera. 
Surrounding shops make and sell traditional Middle Eastern musical instruments. 
A simple stringed saz , a kind of long-necked lute, can be had for less than 
$50. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross the Golden Horn on the sidewalks of the new Galata Bridge, as bland as 
its predecessor was lively. The former bridge was framed in floating fish 
restaurants from which to ogle this unchanged view of the famed Topkapi Palace 
above jostling ferries and fishing dinghies. Rumor (a Byzantine specialty) has 
it that the old bridge may be resurrected, but for now it lies dismantled, 
farther up the Golden Horn, near the cast-iron Church of St. Stephen of the 
Bulgars, another curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
 Labyrinthine walkways beneath Stamboul's reconstructed roadway snarl lead you 
to the gray hulk of the Yeni Valide Mosque. Beside it is Misir Carsisi, the 
Egyptian Market, also called the Spice Bazaar. (Larger mosques were designed 
with shops adjacent so that their rents might support pious programs -- Koranic 
instruction and feeding the indigent.) The pungency of fenugreek-cured beef 
pastirma wafts out from the bazaar. Hucksters of apricot aphrodisiacs and 
kiwi-flavored lekum (Turkish Delight) complement the assault. Sadly, high rents 
have forced many of the more traditional aromatics shops out of the bazaar, but 
one that still maintains standards (as well as a huge selection of culinary and 
medicinal spices) is called Acar, located in stall No. 42. They sell Iranian 
saffron packaged to resemble miniature peacock fans and keep their very best 
rose attar locked in a closet. 
</P>
<P>
 A few yards from Acar is the Kurukahveci coffee grinding and roasting shop. 
Mehmet Kurukahveci's family has sold coffee since before the Ottoman Empire 
lost Yemen, the source of its best beans. Today, the beans are Brazilian, but 
the intense industry and intoxicating aroma of his establishment suggest that 
business has never been better. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the Spice Bazaar's west wall, a riot of scarlet peppers, eggplants, 
leeks, okra and purple carrots announce the presence of one of Istanbul's best 
produce markets. Fresh fruit and vegetables aside, its variety of rice and 
grains is unsurpassed as well. Istanbullus have a reputation as gastronomic 
spendthrifts, addicted to rice pilaf with lots of butter -- which folklore says 
is the food of those who dwell in paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 Stalls on the eastern side of the Spice Bazaar, remains of the Ottoman bird 
market, now sell nursery plants, garden paraphernalia and pets. (Falling 
between the medicinal and pet categories, leeches are sold here, too.) The 
guild of nightingale-sellers is long gone, but the fortune-tellers still use 
rabbits and doves to select folded-paper portents for their clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 Uphill from the Spice Bazaar, the warm smell of sawdust announces the Uzun 
Carsi, the Long Market, full of woodworking shops. Beyond these, with their 
cradles and spoons and such, are suppliers of hunting gear, embroidered 
military insignia and prayer beads. The brass-workers' ateliers sell everything 
from belly dancers' finger cymbals to star-and-crescent minaret finials. Also 
available here: children's hair barrettes, evil eye talismans, Adidas gym bags 
and seamless white ihrams , simple togalike garments worn on the pilgrimage to 
Mecca.  
</P>
<P>
 Toward the top of Uzun Carsi, the veritable suction of the Kapali Carsi, the 
Grand or Covered Bazaar, begins to exert itself. I always try to resist it, 
though, long enough to detour to the back of the Bayazit Mosque, where a 
laconic flea market spreads beneath a gnarled plane tree known as the Tree of 
Idleness. Here, spring-wound watches with lurid green faces and Cyrillic 
lettering count the hours. Lenin medals gather dust amid postage stamps and the 
tarnished coins of defunct empires. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing my weakness -- that I could spend hours here -- I swoop quickly over 
the orange-crate tables, pass up a photo of Archduke Ferdinand and scan 
inventories of Bakelite buttons, crucifixes, keyless locks and a one-armed 
Barbie doll. Sacrilegiously, I'm reminded of a famous Byzantine fresco in the 
Church of St. Saviour in the Stamboul neighborhood of Chora. The painting 
depicts Christ, having broken down the gates of Hell, yanking Adam and Eve from 
their graves on the Day of Judgment. Around their tombs lie the lost things of 
everyday life -- dog bones, keys, pieces of jewelry -- as well as the bound 
Satan. All right, no Barbie dolls, but you get the idea.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, a dark poyraz wind from the Black Sea impatiently rustles the 
leaves on the Tree of Idleness. Whiffs of roasting chestnuts, chick peas, lamb 
fat and long-brewed tea are in the air, but maybe the poyraz carries other 
scents to these vendors of cultural castoffs -- pickled cabbage, sour rye, the 
coal smoke of other towns, other homes washed by the Danube, Don and Dnieper?  
</P>
<P>
 What New York was to Eastern Europeans at the end of the 19th Century, 
Istanbul is to some of their kin at the end of the 20th. Requiring no long 
weeks in steerage, this is a closer El Dorado, one you can reach by bus or 
Aeroflot. And you can go home again, with a bale of blue jeans and soft leather 
jackets to unload in Krakow or Yalta. But you'll probably come back to Istanbul 
again -- to peddle your grandmother's wedding dress, a bogus icon or a dozen 
jars of caviar. Istanbullus call this "suitcase commerce," and the whole area 
between the covered Bazaar and the Aqueduct of Valens thrives on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotels with names like Pisa and Paris are filled with Slavs, Romanians and 
Hungarians learning the free-market ropes. A hand-lettered sign in English 
directs one to "Home-Cooked Cuisine served by Balkanian Turks." These might be 
members of Bulgaria's oppressed minority or even Muslim Bosnians, whom Turkey 
continues to accept into its swollen cities. Another kind of desperation -- or 
boredom -- has adventurous and entrepreneurial non-Muslim "Natashas" from 
Russia investing their capital -- youth, pretty faces, compliant bodies, 
distance from disapproving families -- in the most predictable of professions.  
</P>
<P>
 For respite from the profane, soothe your soul with calligraphic scrolls, 
marbleized papers and leather bindings in the adjacent Booksellers' Bazaar, 
where the written word has been the stock in trade since Byzantine times. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Covered Bazaar. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 After two decades of visiting Istanbul, I know the Kapali Carsi by its scent 
of indigo cloth, its tinkle of tea-glasses, its blindingly bright windows 
filled with 22-karat dowry bangles -- a commodity so fundamental in the Turkish 
economy that their daily price is published beside those other market staples, 
flour and mutton. (While a first-time buyer of Oriental rugs almost always pays 
more for something here than he would back home, virtually no one is cheated on 
gold jewelry. Members of the jewelers guild police each other.) 
</P>
<P>
 Even more glittering are the bazaar's players -- Central Asian Uzbeks hauling 
bundles of quilted coats; a Kurd offering an Indian sari he found in Aleppo; an 
Assyrian Christian dental assistant-turned-goldsmith who tells me that he's 
Jewish, but his best customers are Kuwaitis, and that his sons can sell pearls 
in six languages; a Sephardic leather tailor insisting he's Armenian as he 
flirts with French tourists; a former paratrooper-turned-rug-dealer. 
Personalities shimmer and change color like lengths of silk. 
</P>
<P>

 Telephone numbers and prices: The country code for Turkey is 90. The area code 
for European Istanbul (including all the numbers below) is 312. (Turkish city 
codes have recently changed, so disregard other Istanbul area codes you may 
find in guidebooks.) All prices are approximate, subject to seasonal change and 
computed at the rate of 16,000 Turkish Lira (TL) to the dollar -- but Turkish 
inflation is rampant, so most hotels quote prices in dollars. Hotel prices are 
for a double room for one night. Restaurant prices are for dinner for two, food 
only.

 Getting there: There are connecting flights between Los Angeles and Istanbul

 Where to eat: Istanbul is street-food heaven. If it looks good, it probably 
is. But here are some recommendations when you want to sit down: In Beyoglu: 
Haci Abdullah, Sakizagaci Cad. No. 19; tel. 293-85-61. Homey stews, pilaf and 
puddings; no liquor. Decor is hundreds of jewel-like jars of pickled fruit;

dessert is wonderful and unique; $35. In Stamboul, lunch is usually a better 
bet than dinner. It's hard to go wrong in any of the parlors serving kebabs and 
pide (leavened bread baked with toppings of meat or cheese). For a little more 
elegance: Havuzlu Lokanta, tel. 527-33-46. In the center of the Covered Bazaar, 
this lunch-only restaurant serves stews, salads and grills with old-fashioned 
manners; $20. Kaser Levi Lokantasi, Tahmis Kalcin Sokak, Cavusbasi Han, 23/10 
Eminon, tel. 512-11-96. For a taste of Constantinopolitan pluralism, Sephardic

 THE FIRST PROBLEM IS THAT YOU, SITTING AT home, can't hear the drummers. They 
stand in loose formation onstage -- one of the 11 stages that the New Orleans 
Jazz & Heritage Festival's organizers put up every spring at the city's 
fairgrounds -- and when they've settled properly into a groove, time bends into 
a repeating loop. Their energy and yours multiply. Even the humidity, greatest 
of all natural forces in these parts, begins to seem irrelevant. And while the 
"Mardi Gras Indian" drummers (black New Orleanians who dress in fanciful Native 
American costumes for public events) pound and paradiddle, a clutch of dancers 
shimmies in sequined costumes. Red. Green. Gold. Blue. Silver. A bare-bellied 
woman, ample and undulating. A prancing boy with doe's eyes. All in thrall to 
those drummers. 
</P>
<P>
 You can't smell the gumbo, either. On a late April afternoon, the aroma hangs 
around the long row of food booths on the grassy fairgrounds infield, mingling 
with whiffs of red beans and rice, alligator sausage, peanut soup, fried 
plantains, artichoke-spinach casserole, sweet potato pie, jambalaya, oysters, 
crawfish, soft-shell crab, strawberries dipped in chocolate. On a typical day 
at Jazzfest -- as the event is known in local shorthand -- perhaps 30,000 
customers converge on the fairgrounds, beginning about 11 a.m., their pockets 
stuffed with dollar bills to spend on such snacks. When the music stops at 7 
p.m., they leave, ears ringing and bellies bulging, to confront an evening in 
the single American city most likely to exacerbate those conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 So sound and smell are problems, and until word processors can directly 
deliver those sensations in full glory and subtlety, typing will remain a 
crudely inefficient way of communicating the appeal of the New Orleans Jazz & 
Heritage Festival. Which is why I'm resorting to props. 
</P>
<P>
 Can we have the evidence out front, please? Exhibits A, B and C are three 
smiling faces: one black, one British, one mud-caked. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 EXHIBIT A IS MAHALIA JACKSON -- A WOMAN WITH A ROUND FACE WITH kind eyes and 
formidable mouth, seen in a snatch of old black-and-white video footage. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson grew up in New Orleans. Before she died in 1972, her loud, sure voice 
made her the nation's most famous singer of black gospel music. Thus in 1970, 
when jazz impresario George Wein set about organizing the first Jazzfest 
(originally known as the Louisiana Heritage Fair) as a musical celebration of 
that region's rich cultural mix, jazz and otherwise, he called Jackson. She 
came in for an evening solo concert, which came off as planned. But on the day 
after her performance, Jackson appeared again, as a member of the audience at 
Congo Square, then the venue of the festival's daytime events. Congo Square is 
where slaves and laborers gathered in centuries past to make some of the first 
African-American music heard on this continent. It was, and is, near some 
dispiriting slums, and on this day in 1970, the scene was not auspicious. The 
audience amounted to fewer than 1,000 people, gathered to hear the uniformed 
men of the Eureka Brass Band. Jackson, spotted in the crowd, was soon urged to 
join them in "Just a Closer Walk With Thee." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the secular and fledgling nature of the event, she might have declined. 
Instead, Jackson beamed, raised her famous voice amid the strains of several 
white-hatted brass players and set a precedent of cooperation and informality 
that endures a generation later. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me," festival producer-director Quint Davis said later, "that was the 
eternal spark of what the whole festival was going to be about." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival will celebrate its 25th 
anniversary with a run from April 22 through May 1. The program, which includes 
the Neville Brothers, Little Feat, Little Richard, Aretha Franklin, B.B. King, 
the Allman Brothers and Wynton Marsalis, will follow a much-beloved pattern: 
Performing outdoors, indoors, alone and in 150-voice choirs, about 5,000 
well-known and unknown musicians will deliver rhythm and blues, gospel, Cajun, 
zydeco, Afro-Caribbean, Latin, rock, country and bluegrass music to audiences 
assembled from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The busiest stages will be the 11 at the fairgrounds. Beneath one tent near 
the fairgrounds entrance, only gospel music is heard; in another, the emphasis 
is folk. Jazz has a stage of its own, but despite the festival's name, that 
type of music is only one ingredient in this recipe, and not the dominant one. 
Each performer's set usually lasts 45 to 90 minutes, and the single greatest 
achievement of festival organizers may be their effectiveness in cajoling those 
thousands of musicians through such a precise program. 
</P>
<P>
 In quieter corners of the fairgrounds, workshop coordinators lead sessions on 
Caribbean percussion or storytelling for children (every year, there seem to be 
more, and younger, children at the festival), or jazz history. Craft workers 
arrange displays of kente cloth, Guatemalan fabrics, earrings, prints and 
good-luck charms. In the evenings, after the fairgrounds close, some of the 
performers take over half a dozen venues around town to deliver longer concerts 
at higher prices.  
</P>
<P>
 The festival now rivals Mardi Gras as a magnet for visitors, bringing in more 
than 360,000 every year, about 40% of them from out of town. In fact, if you 
haven't got hotel and air reservations yet for this year's event, you're 
probably better off considering 1995. The faithful do their booking as early as 
a year ahead, and you may recognize them by their smugness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where you will be three to four weeks from now," wrote repeat 
festival-goer Nathan Cobb in the Boston Globe last April, "but I know where I 
will be. And my place will be better than your place." It's an annoying 
sentiment, I know, but I share it. The New Orleans Jazzfest has been my place, 
too, for three of the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 EXHIBIT B IS THE UNCLEAN FACE OF PHIL COSTELLO, 27, OF PLEASANTON,Calif., and 
I won't forget it because I have it in several photographs. Should Phil ever be 
nominated to serve as attorney general, they will become valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil was part of our traveling party to last year's festival. He hadn't been 
to New Orleans before and hadn't much studied its musical traditions, but 
thought the enterprise sounded like a good chance to unwind. Then came the 
rains -- hours and hours of them, which soaked the fairgrounds until it seemed 
as if the surrounding swamps were massing to retake the city. Thousands of 
would-be festival-goers stayed inside. But the show went on, we turned up and a 
healthy sense of abandon took hold. Soon, while the Neville Brothers slipped 
into a smooth rhythmic groove, scores of dancers were casting off their rain 
slickers, sliding atop the mud, diving into the mud and ultimately frolicking 
caked in mud, head to foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after this began, Phil received a polite invitation from two rather 
forward young women, one each from Texas and Louisiana. After a few moments of 
chat, Phil handed me his wallet, folded a $10 bill under his hat and assured me 
that he'd find his own way home. Then he made for the mud. Before we parted 
ways, I caught a look on his face that I have seen before in New Orleans: I 
have been given a chance to overlook certain conventions of civilized behavior 
, this look told me, and I am taking it . 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to suggest that Jazzfest leads to activities any more reckless 
than are found along Bourbon Street any other week of the year. New Orleans is 
a city whose bars have no legal closing time, after all. A city whose economy 
is largely built around the idea of tourists drinking in the streets from 
plastic cups, and a city where a Roman Catholic holy day -- Shrove Tuesday, the 
last day before Lent -- has exploded into the two-week orgy of formal balls, 
street parades, masked reveling and all-purpose, around-the-clock 
overindulgence that is Mardi Gras. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there is more to New Orleans than dissolution, more to it than the 69 bars 
of the French Quarter and the 2,500 restaurants said to be found within a 
50-mile radius of the central city. Architecturally inclined visitors take the 
St. Charles Avenue streetcar past sprawling willow trees and elegant Garden 
District homes to the end of St. Charles Avenue and back. The faithful step 
into St. Louis Cathedral at Jackson Square, where the French founded the city 
in 1718. The culturally inclined stroll through the New Orleans Museum of Art, 
the Contemporary Arts Center, the art galleries in the Warehouse District, the 
antique shops of Royal Street, the river-side Aquarium of the Americas, the 
Audubon Zoo.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, it's some of the other things about New Orleans that work on so many 
people's imaginations -- the gravestones stacked above ground because the 
cemeteries lie beneath sea level; the simultaneous cosmopolitanism and 
parochialism of the people; the obscure allegiances of the neighborhood krewes 
(community fraternal organizations) that throw the Mardi Gras parades; the 
20th-Century poverty beyond the 19th-Century balconies and wrought-iron 
curlicues; the idea that once one leaves the French Quarter, charm may yield to 
menace, and menace to charm, three times in the space of a short, narrow block. 
</P>
<P>
 Against this backdrop, a jazz and heritage festival begins to seem as 
wholesome and stable an enterprise as dairy farming. Though Jazzfest pilgrims 
do tend to clog up the most popular restaurants and crowd the clubs to 
bursting, they overtake the city with a back-to-summer-camp familiarity and 
impose something like order on a notoriously random place. The shrewd veterans 
lean toward tennis shoes, T-shirts and sweat shirts, and the women leave their 
purses at home, carrying instead knapsacks and fannypacks stuffed with sun 
block, sun visors, rain ponchos, perhaps a camera. Some insist on rental cars 
and do battle daily over limited fairgrounds parking; others count on the Gray 
Line shuttle buses that run between the fairgrounds and the French Quarter. 
(Round-trip fares last year ran $5 to $6, depending on the point of departure.) 
Some spend their days sleeping and eating, go clubbing by night and never do 
get to the fairgrounds. Others linger all day at the fairgrounds, dine late and 
never make it to a club or concert. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilgrims make an interesting family: Ed Bradley, the newsman from "60 
Minutes," has been a Jazzfest regular for years. Singer-songwriter Paul Simon 
has turned up in the audience, as has actor John Goodman (who, standing a foot 
taller and weighing about 100 pounds more, is substantially easier to spot). 
Michelle Pfeiffer and Matt Dillon have been around, too. And for every 
celebrity, there are a dozen anonymous and deeply serious aficionados -- people 
like the young man I met by the mixing board at a club performance by the 
Radiators last year. His name was Mark, and he had arrived two hours before, he 
said, after driving more or less straight from Winter Park, Colo. What was he 
so excited about? The chance to plug his fancy tape recorder directly into the 
Radiators' soundboard, thereby making his own tape of the band's performance. 
Four other tape recorders were piggybacked onto the same output line, evidently 
with the band's permission. Up to that night, I thought only the Grateful Dead 
inspired and encouraged such devotion. But when music lovers convene in New 
Orleans, the demonstrations of devotion can get lavish indeed.

 WHICH LEADS US DIRECTLY to Keith. I'm operating strictly from memory here, but 
I remember a jowly oval of a face, a grayish goatee and an expression of rapt 
happiness. Keith, whose last name I don't know, is from England. But every year 
for Jazzfest, he crosses the sea to spend several days more or less worshiping 
the New Orleans-based soul singer Irma Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 There has never been any question about where such worship should take place; 
Thomas and her husband, Emile Jackson, own a bar called the Lion's Den. The 
club lies in a neighborhood that would, and should, intimidate most tourists, 
but late on Jazzfest nights, the Lion's Den fills with out-of-towners who have 
decided that eight hours of music a day is not quite enough. The pilgrims pay 
the $10 cover charge, crowd into a space the size of a three-car garage and 
line up for free red beans and rice while they wait for Thomas and her band, 
the Professionals, to start up. When the lights go down and the Professionals 
start vamping, Keith will usually be found down front in an autographed, 
paunch-stretched Irma Thomas T-shirt, a beer in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, Keith and the rest of the audience wait for the ritual opening: 
Tall, courtly Jackson leads his wife by the hand to the lip of the stage. Then 
Thomas, a remarkable and underappreciated talent, adds her leonine shouting, 
whispering and growling to the music. Into bliss goes Keith. 
</P>
<P>
 Flash back now to the second Friday of last year's festival. A cab delivers my 
wife and me to the Lion's Den. We grab two seats near the stage and make the 
acquaintance of our waitress. The Professionals assemble and give us several 
warm-up songs. Then a pause. We know what this means, and we look for Emile's 
emerging profile. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead, Emile hangs back, and we behold the Lady of the House approaching 
the stage, and beaming like a bride . . . on the arm of our man Keith, who 
grins the grin that I now submit as Exhibit C. Up they step, the Queen and her 
ennobled supplicant, to a splash of vigorous, knowing applause. Keith looks as 
if he might die of acute satisfaction, but he lives and takes his seat down 
front. Away flies the night. GUIDEBOOK

PLACE IN THE SUN; NICE, SENSUAL CAPITAL OF THE FRENCH RIVIERA, ALWAYS SEEMS 
WARMER AND BRIGHTER THAN WHEREVER YOU'VE JUST COME FROM 
</P>

 THE AIR FRANCE AIRBUS FROM gray, icy Paris changes key, eases down through the 
clouds and banks out over the Mediterranean. Suddenly, below us, Nice shines. 
Red tile roofs burn dimly in the late winter sun; white apartment blocks glow 
against brown and green hills. The Baie des Anges, or Bay of the Angels, around 
which Nice curves gently, is a patchwork of muted turquoise (the shade of the 
veined ceramic balusters on villa terraces all over this stretch of coastline), 
deep marine blue (a blue that seems to have no bottom), pale sky blue, murky 
blue with notes of purple, avocado green, sea green, seaweed brown and more. We 
swoop down close to the water and land at its very edge, on a runway built out 
into the bay at the Aeroport de Nice -- Cote d'Azur. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a typical arrival in Nice. One always seems to be approaching it from 
some place colder and less bright. And whether glimpsed first from the air or 
from the autoroute , it always looks warm, handsomely illuminated, welcoming. 
Its sunny, intensely colored, mild-tempered atmosphere is so immediately, 
sensually engaging that the visitor's first reaction, upon stepping onto local 
soil, is likely to be a smile, fueled by a suffusion of well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 Nice is the capital of the Cote d'Azur or Azur Coast -- the French Riviera, 
the glamorous maritime extension of Provence. Bordered in the west by the Var 
River and in the east by a string of little mountains -- Mont Boron, Mont 
Alban, Mont Vinaigrier and Mont Gros -- running inland from the sea, Nice is 
the fifth-largest city in France, with a population approaching 400,000. It is 
a city composed of vastly different quartiers , or neighborhoods, from sterile 
condominium communities to North African slums, from blocks of boring petit 
bourgeois apartment blocks to clusters of elegant mansions hidden behind high 
walls and bougainvillea, from workaday shopping streets to grand boulevards and 
squares. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a city full of art, with museums devoted to Matisse and Chagall, to 
naive and contemporary painting and sculpture, to local artists and the local 
past. It boasts a flashy casino and several major agglomerations of convention 
facilities. Its Promenade des Anglais, which curves right along with the 
coastline from the edge of the airport to the Jardin Albert 1er, is one of the 
most famous and graceful seafront esplanades in the world. (The promenade was 
named in honor of the local English colony, which constructed it in 1820.) 
</P>
<P>
 The historic and sentimental heart of Nice, though, and the portion of the 
city likely to appeal most urgently to the senses, is a large, irregular wedge 
of real estate in its southeastern precincts. The blunt end of this wedge is 
the far bank of the Vieux Port, or Old Port; it tapers off in the gardens just 
past the Place Massena. Within this area are not only that port and that 
square, but also the hilltop park known as Le Chateau (though there hasn't 
actually been a chateau on the site since 1706), the hilly pedestrian quarter 
of Vieux Nice (probably the closest thing to an Italian hill town that exists 
on French soil), the famous flower and produce market on the Cours Saleya -- 
and a stylish continuation of the Promenade des Anglais called the Quai des 
Etats-Unis, or Quay of the United States. Within this wedge, as far as I'm 
concerned, is the real Nice. 
</P>
<P>
 The Old Port is sort of a deckle-cut rectangular basin, long and narrow. Its 
innermost portion, the Bassin Lympia, is crowded with modest pleasure craft and 
a ragtag fleet of dinghies and outboards. A bit farther out, in the Bassin des 
Amiraux, six or eight small commercial fishing boats still dock with their 
just-caught seafood -- turbot, red mullet, monkfish, squid, octopus, occasional 
spiny lobsters and the like.  
</P>
<P>
 On the quay behind the fishing boats is the Marche aux Puces de Nice, or Nice 
Flea Market, a little clapboard village of 33 stands, at which everything from 
crystal and lace to military badges and antique dolls can be found. A far 
better flea market, though, arrays itself every Monday to the west of the port, 
around the Quai Rauba-Capeu (the "Hat Thief Quay," so named for its capricious 
breezes), on the Cours Saleya. This is an astonishing bazaar -- 100 or more 
stands and tables stretch down the length of this beautiful passage. Buildings 
in shades of ocher, terra cotta, white, off-white and pink frame the tile-paved 
Cours. Through the center of it runs a line of yellow canopies. Beneath these 
and on every side, out in the all-but-inevitable sun, a veritable panoply of 
goods is offered -- rusty old locks and keys, exquisite Lalique vases, antique 
cameras, miniature perfume bottles, lots of silverware and linen and glasses, 
books, old postcards, LPs (remember LPs?), lacy baby clothes, paintings, 
jewelry real and otherwise -- even albums full of clothing labels (a 1950s 
Lacoste polo shirt label, for instance -- for about $30!). 
</P>
<P>
 Riches of another sort are sold in the same spot Tuesday through Sunday 
mornings -- flowers, vegetables, fruits and miscellaneous products from local 
farms. This market, renowned all over France, is at once manageable in size and 
incredibly seductive, and is a must to visit -- even if you're staying in a 
hotel and have no place to cook. The stalls explode with color; the scents of 
tuberoses, olives, fresh cheese and dried herbs fill the air; the chatter of 
the market-goers -- punctuated by the often bawdy cries of the sellers -- is 
rough, beguiling music. 
</P>
<P>
 The particulars vary with the season, of course. One day last spring, for 
instance, there were cherries everywhere -- morellos, pigeon hearts, reverchons 
-- and apricots and peaches. There were eggplants, some long and thin and 
purple, others round and white or off-white tinged with violet. Earth-brown 
mushrooms were heaped here and there, exuding their elemental fragrance. Tiny 
potatoes, bulbs of fennel, purple artichokes with long stems, fat asparagus, 
gnarled sweet carrots and great bushy bundles of fresh herbs accented almost 
every stand. I bought a juicy white peach, eating it messily as I strolled 
along. Then I bought a serving of the quintessential Nicois street food -- 
socca.  
</P>
<P>
 Socca is a thin, crumbly, crepe-like thing made from chickpea (garbanzo) 
flour, olive oil, salt and water. It is traditionally cooked over a wood fire 
in wide, black iron pans, dusted with black pepper and cut into triangular 
slices when done and wrapped in paper. It is sold at stands and shops and tiny 
restaurants all over Vieux Nice, and elsewhere in town, but there's something 
particularly appealing about buying it here in the market. The woman who sells 
it is fond of good-natured double-entendres ("You're my first man this 
morning," she once told me with a wink when I showed up at her stand just after 
the first socca was done.). And her easy familiarity, coupled with the flavor 
and aroma of this hot, peppery, earthy local specialty, always makes me feel as 
if Nice has accepted me, or at least welcomed me back.  
</P>
<P>
 Abutting the Cours Saleya and climbing gradually uphill is the old town, the 
warren of narrow stone streets called Vieux Nice. The real "old Nice" though -- 
where the city was born -- must be sought in two other locations, one nearby, 
one not. The farther site, a few miles to the north, is the hill of Cimiez -- 
where the Romans established their regional capital of Cemenelum in 14 BC. The 
nearer one, straight uphill from the old town and the Cours Saleya, is the hill 
of Le Chateau. Here, about 350 years before the Romans, Phocean Greeks from 
Marseille had established a minor trading town called Nikaia -- "She who brings 
victory." The two settlements developed simultaneously, but by the 5th Century 
AD, most of the inhabitants of Cimiez had moved to the more agreeable (and more 
easily defended) site nearer the sea. First on the hilltop and then spilling 
down the slopes to the bay, Nikaia became Nice.  
</P>
<P>
 Though Cimiez is beyond the confines of my favored wedge of the city, I love 
going there. The Roman and paleo-Christian ruins are elegantly simple and 
evocative; there's a superb archeological museum; the city's newly improved and 
expanded Matisse Museum, in a 17th-Century villa with dark terra cotta walls 
and trompe l'oeil balustrades, displays an attractively miscellaneous 
collection of Matisse artifacts, early paintings and drawings, liturgical 
designs and more, and an architecturally spare but richly furnished Franciscan 
monastery, in whose cemetery Matisse and Raoul Dufy are buried, serves as a 
quiet spiritual anchor to the spot. From certain vantage points here, it is 
possible to see Roman remains, the Matisse villa, the monastery's thin spire, 
an observatory dome across the way on Mont Gros and the ornate late 
19th-Century Hotel Regina (now turned into luxury apartments), all in one frame 
of vision. It feels like an eccentric diorama of 2,000 years or so of Nicois 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 The hill of Le Chateau, when seen from the quay at night, is an imposing, 
mysterious sight. It is selectively (and skillfully) spotlighted to fine 
effect, white or yellow beams exposing a patch of green here, vignettes of 
amber there -- and illuminating the course of a cascade spilling down the 
hillside. During the day, on the top of the hill, mystery is replaced by scenes 
of outdoor domesticity -- children scrambling over playground gear, families 
spread out with picnic lunches on the thick grass, couples sipping coffee, or 
pastis , at the little buvette , or snack bar. Beyond occasional shards of 
ancient wall and a rather banal 16th-Century bastion called the Tour Bellanda 
(which now houses a small naval museum), there isn't much to see here -- but 
this summit, rarely visited by tourists precisely because of its lack of 
attractions, offers wonderful views of the city and bay and welcome respite 
from the sometimes loud and crowded streets below. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing the Quai des Etats-Unis, a staircase and an elevator lead up to Le 
Chateau; the tariff for the latter is about 65 cents one way, $1 round-trip. I 
always buy the one-way billet, then walk down the back side of the hill, 
straight into Vieux Nice. I've already compared this quarter to an Italian 
town. There's a good reason for its Italianate flavor: From 1388 until 1792, 
and again from 1814 until 1860, Nice and its region belonged to the Italian 
dynasty of the House of Savoy. 
</P>
<P>
 This heritage is evident all over the city, but it is particularly vivid in 
the old town -- in architecture, language (Nissart, a dialect of Provencal 
liberally peppered with Italian, is still heard frequently, especially in the 
markets and the port), family names and, in a more elusive way, local 
sensibility. The streets curve almost imperceptibly, overhung with narrow iron 
balconies, open shutters, flower boxes, strings of laundry. The colors of the 
buildings are earthy but somehow distilled into memorable hues -- the yellow of 
certain kinds of clay, the beige of desert dust, the pink of flamingos seen 
though hazy heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Occupying these structures are endless little shops, some prosaic and geared 
to locals (newsstands, pharmacies), others are more exotic galleries or 
boutiques. Scattered through the quarter, too, are many small restaurants and 
bars. The shops, especially the more conventional ones, bear names like 
Fantino, Rossetti, Ricci-Gagliolo, Caprioglio, Fuscielli. The eating and 
drinking places are more international. There are certainly establishments 
specializing in Nicois cooking (including socca and a sort of cheeseless pizza 
called pissaladiere ), but then there are Scarlett O'Hara's Irish Pub, Billy's 
Tex-Mex Restaurant, Pub Van Gogh, La Table Thai, Nick le Grec and Cafe de Klomp 
("12 beers on tap"). Some streets wind off into dark alleys, silent, drab and 
damp. Others bustle with the bright signs of shops, with busy-bee tourists, 
strolling tourists, ambling dogs, scampering cats. 
</P>
<P>
 The old town's main square is the cafe-filled Place Rosetti, onto which faces 
the politely baroque Cathedral of Ste. Reparate. The cathedral is worth a 
visit, especially for anyone who appreciates exquisitely carved wood paneling 
and choir stalls. Just before Christmas last year, I stepped into the place 
early one evening to hear a clutch of pure- if not particularly strong-voiced 
young women in white blouses and dark skirts sing Bach, Mozart and a selection 
of Provencal carols. The church was chilly and packed full, the lights were 
dim, the feeling was almost medieval. 
</P>
<P>
 After the concert, in need of both warmth and some measure of modernization, I 
stopped in a cafe on the Cours Saleya for a glass of wine. Then I walked down 
the Rue des Ponchettes, on the edge of the old town, just below Le Chateau, and 
had dinner at my favorite Nicois restaurant, Don Camillo. Here, a young 
Nice-born chef named Franck Cerutti applies sophisticated techniques to simple 
local cooking -- producing such wonders as tender baby octopus with plump white 
beans, dried cod cooked with olives, pine nuts and potatoes, red mullet with 
socca crepes and tapenade (olive-caper puree) and stewed duck with homemade 
noodles. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerutti lives a few doors from his restaurant, which is only a few yards from 
the Quai des Etats-Unis, and I encountered him one spring morning several years 
ago leaning on the railing above the beach, just staring out at the Baie des 
Anges. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you looking at?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the bay," he said. And though he had been seeing that body of water 
probably daily for at least 30 years, I understood why he could still find 
something across its reaches worth gazing at. I stood there with him in 
silence. This time, the water was no patchwork at all. It was a single color, a 
subtle blue-tinged green, darkening ever so slightly toward the horizon. The 
sun, still traveling up from the east, was brilliant yellow -- a morning sun 
anticipating midday. The sky was bright blue overhead, pinkish on the edges. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not bad, eh?" said Cerutti finally. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," I said, "not bad at all." GUIDEBOOK

 Where to stay: Nice is full of hotels in every category. Here are three 
recommended establishments adjacent to Vieux Nice: Hotel Beau-Rivage, 24 Rue 
St-Francois-de-Paule, telephone 93-80-80-70, fax 93-80-55-77. Contemporary 
styling and charmingly furnished rooms in a grand 19th-Century building where 
both Chekhov and Matisse once lived. A favorite with divas performing at the 
nearby Opera de Nice. Rates: $180-$280. Hotel La Perouse, 11 Quai Rauba-Capeu, 
tel. 93-62-34-63, fax 93-62-59-41. My favorite. Attached to the lower reaches 
of the hill of Le Chateau and overlooking the bay, it's much larger than it 
appears from the street, with a hidden interior terrace with swimming pool, 
lemon-tree-shaded breakfast area and summertime grill. Rooms with terraces on 
the fourth and fifth floors have spectacular views, and on the sixth floor 
there is an outdoor hot tub. Rooms are simple but comfortable and 
well-equipped. Rates: $85-$210. Primotel Suisse Nice, 15 Quai Rauba-Capeu, tel. 
93-62-33-00, fax 93-85-30-70. Part of a bargain-priced chain, this hotel is 
right next to the La Perouse, and many of the rooms, clean and simple, have 
similarly good views. Facilities are much more basic, though. Location and 
price are the main attractions here. Rates: $70-$95. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Where to eat: Again, the choices are numerous, but in or near Vieux Nice, 
these places are particularly good: Don Camillo, 5 Rue des Ponchettes, tel. 
93-85-67-95, a small, family-run place serving up the savors of Nice in refined 
but still soulful variations, $80-$120. L'Escalinada, 22 Rue Pairoliere, tel. 
93-62-11-71, a comfortable little place in the old town, serving real, 
home-style Nicois cooking -- raviolis , gnocchis , vegetable beignets, etc., 
$50. La Merenda, 4 Rue de la Terrasse, no phone, reservations are unheard of 
and credit cards are worthless at this tiny restaurant, and when the food runs 
out, the chef-proprietor hangs a sign on the door reading " C'est fini ." The 
cooking is superb, though, and as authentically local as can be, from noodles 
with pistou (the Nicois pesto) and deep-fried zucchini blossoms to stewed tripe 
and beef in red wine sauce, $65-$95. Le Safari, 1 Cours Saleya, tel. 
93-80-18-44, the cafe portion out front is a popular hangout for the local 
citizenry; the warm, comfortable, always-bustling interior serves Nicois 
specialties, lots of good, simply cooked fish, miscellaneous dishes from other 
parts of France and great pizza in five or six varieties, with thin, crisp 
crusts always slightly black around the edges and perfumed with wood smoke, 
$60-$100 (pizzas, $10). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>

FLYING BLIND; THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO SEE THE WORLD AND ALL ITS COLORS

 WE WERE SOARING OVER THE PACIFIC IN A JETLINER on our first trip to Hawaii, 
and lunch was being served. I was so excited by the whole idea of the trip that 
I expected even the airplane fare to be exotic. My first bite proved me right. 
It was something quite unlike anything I'd ever tasted before -- produce of 
some kind, fresh and light, with an elusive, slightly spicy flavor. What was 
it? I wondered. Some rare tropical fruit? Some uncommon island vegetable? 
</P>
<P>
 "Honey," said my wife, Linda, as I was trying to decide. "Don't eat that. It's 
an orchid." 
</P>
<P>
 That happened more than 17 years ago, on one of the first trips I took after 
losing my sight. It was an eye-opening experience. Until that moment, I don't 
think I'd quite realized how different it was going to be to travel blind. 
</P>
<P>
 Born with glaucoma, an eye disease that usually afflicts the elderly, I had 
lost all vision in my left eye by the age of 10. I got used to sitting in the 
front row at movies and, even when I was old enough to drive, in the back seat 
of the car. In the mid-1970s, a detached retina left me with nothing but light 
perception in my remaining eye; a few years later, an infection took that, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference between poor eyesight and no eyesight is immense. Getting used 
to the change was not easy. Still, I saw no reason to let my loss affect the 
way I lived any more than absolutely necessary. I've always loved to travel, 
for instance, and I wasn't about to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the benefit of vision, I have seen (and I think that's the right word 
for it) some of the most beautiful and exciting places on earth -- not just 
Hawaii, but Tahiti and Bermuda; New York, Washington, Las Vegas and New 
Orleans; England and Mexico; Yosemite, the Grand Canyon, Big Sur. 
</P>
<P>
 I read once that blindness was the most feared of all major disabilities. 
People who have not had to confront it find the notion of living in eternal 
darkness unthinkable. Well, OK, it's not exactly a piece of cake. But it's not 
the end of the world -- or the end of seeing the world. It's just that, as I 
found out on the plane to Hawaii, you have to come at it from a new direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel brochures abound with phrases like "dazzling sunsets" and "azure 
skies." I'll have to take their word for it. But I can still hear the music, 
feel the heat (or the chill), smell the blossoms (or the wood smoke), sense the 
excitement, relive the history, find the incredible bargain, taste the food and 
wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Do the blind experience some aspects of travel more intimately and immediately 
than sighted travelers? I don't know. This blind traveler simply does what he 
can to get the most out of each trip. I cannot literally see a majestic 
procession of waves crashing onto a curving beach, for instance, but I can 
listen to them carefully and figure out whether the beach is rocky or sandy, 
rough or smooth; sometimes I can even hear the undertow. More than that, I can 
dive right into the scene, swimming through the waves' power, their height, 
their salty, cold wetness. Of course, a sighted traveler can listen and dive 
in, too -- but why would he? He can just glance at the sight for a moment or 
two, then move on to something else. Because I can't give my surroundings a 
quick visual once-over, I'm forced to become a part of them. And isn't 
achieving some sort of unity with a new environment one of the traveler's 
traditional goals? 
</P>
<P>
 That isn't to say that I "see" more than those who have vision. There is a 
popular idea that the blind have enhanced senses of hearing and touch that 
somehow compensate for the lack of sight. That's hogwash. I don't hear any 
better than anyone else -- but I probably pay closer attention to what I hear. 
It's a matter of focus. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife is good at describing things to me. I also touch things a lot and ask 
a lot of questions. Tour guides are important to most travelers, but they are 
crucial to the blind. Someone who provides anecdote-filled details of a place's 
history, heritage and culture can make up for much of what the blind traveler 
cannot see. 
</P>
<P>
 At least once on every trip I really resent my blindness. That may sound like 
an odd statement because it implies that I enjoy being sightless the rest of 
the time. I don't. I accept it because I have no choice. But once or twice on 
every trip I get briefly depressed about not being able to see something. 
During these little exercises in self-pity, I don't want to talk or listen to 
descriptions of what I am not seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened in New York once, on the Empire State Building's observation 
floor. From there, the sighted can see into several states if the smog isn't 
too thick. It also happened at the Tower of London and at the White House -- 
both places I had read about many times, but visited too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Some blind travelers are truly daring. They go to places like a Colorado ski 
resort I read about, where certain runs are reserved for those who cannot see. 
They might sign up with one of the many white-water rafting outfits that 
encourage the disabled to get wet and enjoy a little excitement. For all I 
know, they might sky-dive or bungee-jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Not me. I never did that kind of stuff when I could see, and I'm not going to 
start now. Flying blind is adventure enough.

RUSSIAN RIVERS; A CRUISE BETWEEN ST. PETERSBURG AND MOSCOW, ALONG THE WATERWAYS 
OF THE CZARS, REVEALS RUSSIA'S HIDDEN HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Julian More, More, who lives in France, is the author of eight books, most 
recently A Taste of Burgundy (Abbeville Press). He is working on his next book, 
Pagnol's Provence. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter the Great loved water. He learned to sail at the age of 12; he studied 
navigation and shipbuilding; he even worked in the shipyards of Amsterdam -- 
after he had become czar. He also built the first Russian navy and commanded 
ships in successful sea battles against the Turks and Swedes. And in 1703, on 
the Neva River delta, he founded the great, lovely, canal-laced seaport of St. 
Petersburg, which became known as "the Venice of the North."  
</P>
<P>
 St. Petersburg was a glorious city, a miracle of 18th-Century town planning. 
Built literally from the ground up -- and the ground was a morass of marshland 
and islets -- it grew into a complex of about 35,000 buildings, many of them 
designed by architects imported from Switzerland, Italy, Germany, France and 
Scotland. Peter stocked St. Petersburg with aristocratic families, 
distinguished merchants, artisans of every kind. Science, art and literature 
flourished. In 1712, he declared it capital of the Russian Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, St. Petersburg -- having been renamed Petrograd and then Leningrad in 
the meantime -- has reclaimed its historic identity, and reminders of its 
former glory are everywhere. Golden domes and soaring spires are still 
reflected in its canals, and the vivid yellows, greens, reds and blues of its 
rococo and neoclassical palaces have a stage-set brilliance -- especially when 
illuminated by the sharp-etched light of the setting sun. Catherine the Great's 
famed Hermitage may be in trouble -- plagued by vandalism, threatened by 
unstable riverbank soil and humidity -- but its stunning Rembrandts, Picassos 
and Matisses and its gold-and-crystal chandeliers are still bathed in limpid, 
northern light bounced up through the windows off the Neva. 
</P>
<P>
 And on the quayside, in the city's working port district, a brass band props 
up a notice reading, in English: "All the money you provide will be used to 
revive the great cultural heritage of our city." They are playing "Tiger Rag." 
</P>
<P>
 We've come to the port to board the M/V Sergei Kirov, a sleek, 1988-vintage 
German-built riverboat that is to take us, and about 250 other passengers, from 
St. Petersburg to Moscow. In a way, this is another legacy of Peter the Great 
and his love for water. Today, an intricate network of lakes, canals, rivers 
and reservoirs connects the two cities, passing through some of the most 
beautiful countryside in the Russian heartland, past remote islands and 
villages hard to visit any other way. Peter didn't construct this network 
himself, but he inspired it and got it started. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1961, these waterways were opened to Russian tourism; in 1991, foreign 
visitors were invited to ply the route for the first time. It used to take the 
czars and their families 18 days to make the cruise. We took 11, including two 
nights each in St. Petersburg and Moscow, using the Kirov as our hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 And an international hotel it was: The boat's captain and crew were Russian; 
the chefs were Swiss (serving food that was light, tasty and occasionally 
Russian); an English company booked the cruise, and the public relations was 
American -- personified by a zippy, young, first-generation American-Russian 
cruise director from San Francisco.The accommodations were well-designed, 
comfortable double-berth cabins.  
</P>
<P>
 The night of our departure, the captain made a speech of welcome, and we drank 
toasts in reddish Russian champagne. Then off we went. Almost at once, the 
warehouses and factories of the port district gave way to an almost bucolic 
landscape of romantically dilapidated homes with vegetable gardens and little 
orchards alongside, interspersed with a surprising number of new dachas 
sprouting along the riverbanks. Then the silver birch and fir trees thickened, 
and we glided almost silently into the twilight. 
</P>
<P>
 During the night, the Neva bore us into Lake Ladoga, said to be the largest 
body of fresh water in Europe, about 136 miles long, 80 miles wide and as deep 
as 730 feet in some places. The navigation channel was slightly choppy in the 
brisk wind, and the vast moonlit expanse of water was a dramatic change from 
the confines of the Neva. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, we sailed out of the lake into the placid Svir River, its 
banks so densely wooded in places that we felt as if we were sailing through a 
primeval forest. The air was filled with the sweet scent of sawdust, and we 
passed small sawmills and great rafts of logs. Then came a long stretch of 
dachas crowding the river, their backs giving onto more dense woods. Here and 
there, a fisherman waited patiently at the water's edge for a catch of pike, 
bream, perch or Baltic salmon. All the way to Moscow, we were to pass through 
landscapes like this one -- riverfront communities with what looked like sheer 
wilderness behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 When we docked at the tiny village of Svirstroi, our captain went ashore to go 
mushrooming. We decided to explore on our own, penetrating the edge of the 
woods and walking over a carpet of green, gold and gray lichen. My wife picked 
a spectacular red-and-white spotted mushroom, and over garden fences, on our 
way back to the boat, we showed it proudly to villagers stacking birch logs for 
winter. Our mushroom was a source of much excited gesturing. One toothless 
babushka slapped her head and grabbed her throat when she saw it. It was 
apparently the most poisonous mushroom in all of Russia, and we carefully 
disposed of it. 
</P>
<P>
 That evening, we glided into Lake Onega and docked at Kizhi Island, now an 
open-air museum of ancient wooden farm and church architecture. The next 
morning, light seemed to dance through the air as the rising sun glanced off 
the silvery aspen wood scales covering the 22 onion domes clustered atop the 
island's Preobrazhenskawa Church, or Church of the Transfiguration. Our guide 
to the island was a young woman named Luba, who lived on Kizhi. Showing us a 
19th-Century farmhouse adorned with a fretwork fertility symbol, Luba recounted 
an old local custom: "If a girl wanted a husband, she would go naked into a 
young farmer's field to wash face and body in dew. When she went again next 
day, generally boy would be there waiting." She added dryly, "Later, with 
collective farms, it was not so simple." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Kirov sailed that afternoon, the domes glowed pink, and a 
tintinnabulation of joyous bells rang out. A barge carrying massive logs 
followed us out of the lake into the Vitegra-Kovzha canal. The countryside now 
was rolling, hilly. At twilight, with the moon rising, we ascended from the 
Stygian depths of one lock till the tops of fir trees welcomed us. The gates 
opened, and we drifted on, our bows forging moonlit ripples on still, dark 
waters, the forest a constant brooding presence on either side. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, we docked near the fortified monastery at Belozersk, on Beloe 
Ozero, or White Lake. This vast lakeside complex of towers, bastions, churches 
and a cathedral once protected local muzhiks or peasants from the Mongol 
hordes. Badly in need of restoration and bereft of its monks since the 
Revolution, it is now imbued with melancholy majesty. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether more human was our stop the following day: We sailed down the 
Sheksna Canal, through the vast Rybinskoe Reservoir, past the river port of 
Rybinsk and down an arm of the fabled Volga River to the fortress-monastery of 
Yaroslavl, the oldest city on the river.  
</P>
<P>
 The monastery compound is now a public park, where the citizens of Yaroslavl, 
temporarily escaping their cramped living quarters, relax in a tree-shaded 
courtyard ablaze with flower beds. We inspected the doors of the monks' cells, 
purposely made extremely narrow to discourage them from overeating, and 
marveled at the highly ornamented Church of the Epiphany, with its 17th-Century 
frescoes by local artists. 
</P>
<P>
 At Uglich, a sleepy, leafy Volga town dating from the 10th Century, we 
wandered among the Sunday shoppers. The food shop on the main street smelled of 
black bread and pickles. Customers carrying milk cans lined up for milk, smoked 
fish, sausage, buckwheat and Mars bars -- a confection seemingly ubiquitous in 
Russia today; the cashiers added up purchases by abacus.  
</P>
<P>
 Uglich is a religious town. The church in the local kremlin , or fortress, is 
now a museum -- but people still pray there before an icon of the Virgin Mary, 
whose veil is said to have floated down the Volga to the town. 
</P>
<P>
 Passing through a progression of locks below Dubna on the final leg of our 
journey, we entered the Moskva River and were soon moored in the Russian 
capital itself. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day we left Moscow -- traveling by plane this time, not boat -- another 
250 passengers boarded the Sergei Kirov for a cruise in the other direction, 
downstream to St. Petersburg. I wished for a moment that I could join them, 
relishing once again that slow boat through the Russian heartland. GUIDEBOOK

PAINT IT BLACK; SMOKESTACKS BELCHING DARK SMOKE INTO THE MEDITERRANEAN SKY? 
MEMORABLE, THINKS THE AUTHOR, AND EXCEEDINGLY BEAUTIFUL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Aldous Huxley 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Your genuine traveler," wrote the English author Aldous Huxley in 1924 (in an 
essay rhetorically titled "Why Not Stay Home?"), "is so much interested in real 
things that he does not find it necessary to believe in fables. He is 
insatiably curious, he loves what is unfamiliar for the sake of its 
unfamiliarity, he takes pleasure in every manifestation of beauty."  
</P>
<P>
 These words seem to define Huxley's own reactions to a sight he encountered 
unexpectedly on the Italian island of Elba -- reactions he recorded in another 
essay of the same period, called "Portoferraio." (Both appear in the collection 
"Along the Road; Notes and Essays of a Tourist," available in a reprint edition 
from Ecco Press and in a new British edition published by Flamingo.) Elba is a 
tiny island, covering about 86 square miles and located about six miles off the 
coast of Tuscany, southwest of Livorno. It was famous in the ancient world for 
its deposits of iron ore (which literally colored Huxley's experience of it ) , 
but, of course, it is best known to us today as the place to which Napoleon was 
exiled after his first abdication in 1814. Portoferraio, which means 
"ironworker's port," is the island's main town, and it was here that Napoleon 
lived, in the Villa dei Mulini.  
</P>
<P>
 Huxley, who was born a century ago this year and who died in his Hollywood 
home on Nov . 22, 1963 (a day on which the world was occupied with a more fa 
mous death), is best remembered for his satirical fantasy "Brave New World" and 
for such other novels as "Crome Yellow," "Antic Hay," "Island" and "Point 
Counter Point." It is perhaps worth remembering, though, in light of the 
perceptual leaps and artistic associations he summons up in the passage that 
follows, that -- years after writing his travel sketches -- he became a 
pioneering experimenter with LSD and wrote two highly personal and 
philosophical books on the subject, "The Doors of Perception" and "Heaven & 
Hell." * 
</P>
<P>
 The sky was Tiepolo's palette. A cloud of smoke mounted into the blue, white 
where it looked toward the sun and darkening, through the color of the shadowed 
folds in a wedding gown, to gray. In the foreground on the right a tall pink 
house went up, glowing like a geranium, into the sunlight. There was the stuff 
there for a Madonna with attendant saints and angels; or a scene from Trojan 
history; or a Crucifixion; or one of the little amours of Jupiter Tonans. 
</P>
<P>
 The earth was Mediterranean -- a piece of the Riviera completely surrounded by 
water. In a word, Elba. The hills dived down into a handsomely curved bay, full 
of bright, staring blue sea. On the headland at one end of the bay Portoferraio 
was piled up in tiers of painted stucco. At its feet lay a little harbor 
bristling with masts. A smell of fish and the memory of Napoleon haunted the 
atmosphere inveterately. Conscience and Baron Baedeker had told us that we 
ought to visit Napoleon's house -- now very suitably, a natural history museum. 
But we had hardened our hearts and would not go. It is very unpleasant not to 
have done one's duty. "How tedious is a guilty conscience," says the Cardinal 
in the "Duchess of Malfi." He was quite right. We had walked the blazing 
streets groaning under conviction of sin. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, passing through a gateway in the walls of the old town, we found 
ourselves confronted by a scene that entirely relieved us of all our sense of 
guilt. For we were looking at something compared with which a house full of 
Napoleonic souvenirs was so obviously second-rate and dull that our rebellion 
against Baedeker ceased to be criminal and became positively meritorious. 
</P>
<P>
 Below us, on the farther side of a blue inlet of the sea, and with the 
mountains behind it, lay a little piece of the Black Country. In the midst 
stood a group of blast furnaces with three huge chimneys rising from beside 
them like the bell towers of a cathedral. To the right of them were five or six 
more chimneys. Three huge cranes were perched at the water's edge, and an iron 
bridge led from the wharves inland to the furnaces. The chimneys, the cranes, 
the furnaces and buildings, the heap of rubbish, the very ground in this little 
area between the Mediterranean and the mountains -- all were soot-black. Black 
against the sky, black against the golden-glaucous hills, blackly reflected in 
the shining blue water. 
</P>
<P>
 I should have painted the scene if I had known how. It was exceedingly 
beautiful. Beautiful and dramatic too. The mind delights in violent contrasts. 
Birmingham is frightful enough where it is, its body in Warwickshire and its 
sooty tentacles stretching out across the undulating land into Stafford. But 
set it down in Sicily or on the shores of Lago Maggiore and its frightfulness 
becomes at once more painfully apparent. In Warwickshire it is a full-length 
sermon on civilization, but one sleeps through sermons. Beside the 
Mediterranean it becomes the most bitingly memorable of epigrams. Moreover, the 
actual Birmingham of Warwickshire is too large to be taken in as a whole. This 
single piece of blackness between the blue sky and the blue sea was compactly 
symbolic. And because the sky and the grass were still visible all around it, 
the contest between industrialism and the natural beauties of the earth was 
much more vividly realized than where, as in the great towns of the north, 
industrialism has completely triumphed and one is not even aware of the 
existence of what has been conquered. 
</P>
<P>
 We stood for a long time, watching the smoke from the chimneys as it mounted 
into the still air. White gauze; white satin, glossy or shadowed; feathery gray 
-- Tiepolo's angels hovered; and the blue sky was the Madonna's silken robe; 
and the tall pink house on our right was the color of one of those very 
handsome velvets to which, in the paradise of the last of the Venetians, the 
blest are so excusably partial.

 More whiskey was the last thing either of us wanted that evening, but it would 
have been unconscionable to refuse our host David Evamy's toast. His 
restaurant, called The Anchorage, had been named Scotland's finest by 
prestigious Decanter magazine the week before -- extraordinary for a 25-seat 
eatery in Tarbert, a postcard-size fishing village in southwest Scotland's 
Kintyre Peninsula. With dinner now over, Evamy had dispensed with his duties as 
maitre d' and joined us at the table bearing three glasses and an unfamiliar 
bottle whose label read, "Springbank 21-year-old single malt whisky." Evamy 
poured three hefty measures and raised his glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Spare us. My traveling companion Cynthia and I had just stepped wobbly-legged 
off the ferry from Islay ("A wee bit rough today," conceded a crew member, 
himself a little green around the epaulets), the island intended to be the last 
stop on our blurry pilgrimage through Scotland's lowland, highland and island 
whiskey country. We had seen it all, done and drunk it all. Or so we thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cheers," said Evamy. Cynthia and I glanced at each other, and reluctantly did 
the same. Hmmmm. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, we were hurtling 40 miles southward toward the Springbank 
distillery in Campbeltown, source of the finest whiskey we had ever tasted. 
According to Evamy, Springbank is Scotland's oldest family-owned distillery and 
one of just two of that country's distillers not in corporate clutches 
(Glenlivet is the other). More significantly, Springbank makes the only whiskey 
ever voted "best aged spirit" three years in a row by Britain's authoritative 
Decanter. 
</P>
<P>
 But on this fall 1992 day, as we passed alternately through hailstorms and 
blinding sunshine, flanked on one side by crashing surf and on the other by 
lush hillside punctuated by ancient stone farmhouses and grazing cattle and 
sheep, we couldn't help posing the question: How come we had never heard of the 
stuff? The answer awaited us in Campbeltown. 
</P>
<P>
 Single malts such as Springbank are the product of just one distillery, and 
have only recently come into their own. Until the 1960s, almost all single 
malts went to bottlers of "blends." Blended whiskeys such as Chivas Regal and 
Cutty Sark are mixes of up to 50 whiskey varieties. Scots have always drunk 
single malts, but it's only in the last decade that they have made them widely 
available overseas; sales of single malts tripled in the '80s, and names like 
Glenlivet and Glenfiddich are now well known to American drinkers. Unlike the 
smooth, consistent, but characterless blends whose market share has dwindled 
due to changing attitudes toward drinking, single malts are growing in 
popularity precisely because of their strong, idiosyncratic personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 The flavor and aroma of a single malt whiskey often reveal its place of 
origin. From the Lowlands come soft, gentle whiskeys such as Auchentoshan and 
Bladnoch (neither distillery open to the public). On Islay, the single malts 
tend to be powerful and pungent because the brine-soaked peat bogs from which 
the water comes imbue island whiskeys such as Laphroaig and Bunnahabhain with 
an earthy, aromatic character suffused with the influence of the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time we set off for Campbeltown, we had sampled dozens of single malts, 
but none like the Springbank we had tasted the night before. With its balance 
of elegance and vigor, to us this was the quintessential Scottish single malt 
whiskey. 
</P>
<P>
 Our route to Campbeltown wended its way through villages whose names bespoke 
southwest Scotland's Celtic heritage -- Bellachroy, Rhunahaorine, Auchinfaud. 
As we sped through their remote communities, villagers turned from what they 
were doing and waved unselfconsciously. Outside Auchinfaud stood a walled-in 
graveyard that seemed eerily peaceful despite the 10-foot waves that crashed 
deafeningly on the rocks just yards away. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We arrived in Campbeltown looking for Gordon Wright, a direct descendant of 
Springbank's founder and the person who ran the distillery. Evamy had given us 
his name, and told us to look for him this particular day at Springbank's 
retail outlet, Eaglesome Ltd., in the middle of town. 
</P>
<P>
 If Aladdin were in the whiskey trade, Eaglesome's is what his cave would look 
like. Oh sure, there were some gourmet food items here and there, but the poky 
little store's stock in trade is booze. Every single malt whiskey known to 
mankind appeared to be balanced precariously on its shelves. At least a dozen 
Springbank single malts were displayed, including a 15-year-old vintage that 
the family owners of the distillery allow to be sold only here. 
</P>
<P>
 Just moments after we arrived at Eaglesome's, the door swung open, and in 
trooped Gordon Wright and his family. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be convenient for the purposes of this story if Gordon Wright were a 
red-bearded and kilted Scotsman who bellowed "och aye, the noo!" wherever he 
went. But in his jeans and leather bomber jacket, the handsome and hefty Wright 
is a thoroughly modern fellow who just happens to make whiskey the 
old-fashioned way, as he was about to explain. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the way from America, eh?" he said. "Well, in that case I suppose we'd 
better have a chat." 
</P>
<P>
 Ushering us into the store's cluttered back room, Wright dusted off some 
glasses and launched an impromptu tasting of several Springbank vintages, 
including a smooth-as-silk, 33-year-old that sells for $150. 
</P>
<P>
 We talked as we drank, and it soon became apparent why Springbank produces 
whiskey that is at once extraordinary and obscure. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a family business," said Wright. "We don't have an amorphous group of 
shareholders to keep happy. Our smallness means we have no budget to market our 
whiskey, but it enables us to do things in a very non-corporate fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 To illustrate his point, Wright ducked out of the room and returned with two 
bottles of his 21-year-old. Each was a very different color. We knew by now 
that whiskey is aged in secondhand sherry or bourbon casks, but not that sherry 
casks yield a tea-colored whiskey, while the whiskey aged in bourbon casks 
comes out the shade of white wine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most distillers color their whiskey with caramel before bottling it to give 
it a color consistency," said Wright. "Not only does that affect the taste of 
the whiskey, but it's incredibly presumptuous to assume that your customers are 
so unsophisticated that they'd be confused by this. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Springbank doesn't advertise, but a recent event unprecedented in 500 years of 
Scotland's whiskey history garnered the distillery the kind of publicity money 
can't buy. In 1991, Wright was checking his stocks for an 18-year-old whiskey 
to bottle when he discovered two rum barrels among his sherry and bourbon 
casks. Checking his distillery logs, Wright discovered that in 1971 the 
distillery manager had on a whim decided to age two lots of whiskey in these 
rum casks. Lo and behold, when Wright opened the barrels he found the world's 
first-ever green whiskey. Exposure on the BBC and in the London Times helped 
Wright turn the forgotten experiment into a $50,000 windfall by selling it at 
$50 a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 "How about a look-see of the distillery?" asked Wright when it started 
becoming obvious that his bleary-eyed guests might have sampled quite enough of 
his fine single malt whiskey. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a rare privilege, indeed, as Springbank is the only distillery of any 
note in Scotland that doesn't give tours of its premises. Even on remote, 
rain-lashed Islay, distillery tours are followed by video presentations. In 
fact, the hundred or so distilleries in Scotland are owned by just a handful of 
public-relations-savvy corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten minutes later, Wright slid an enormous copper key into the distillery main 
gate and, with a grunt, pushed it open. His wife slipped into her office (she's 
responsible for domestic sales), and Gordon Wright began an off-the-cuff tour 
of the beery-smelling, disorganized collection of early 19th-Century buildings 
that constitute the Springbank distillery. In attendance: Cynthia and I, kids 
Rebecca and John, and Missy, the Wrights' irascible border collie. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright had every intention of giving a polished account of how the family 
business runs, but his e lan was punctured by his young charges. Their 
hyperactive hound pestered him at every turn, dropping a stick at his feet 
every few moments and then backing up in anticipation of his throwing it. 
Wright pretended to ignore the dog, but it was clear she was ruining his 
concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 No big deal. By now we could recite verbatim how the Scots make their malt 
whiskey. Springbank makes its single malt whiskey in the same way that the 
100-ish other distilleries in Scotland do. With one difference -- it is the 
only distillery that completes all processing steps on its own premises (most 
distillers contract out the malting, the process by which grain is soaked and 
gently ground). 
</P>
<P>
 Having thanked the Wrights for their hospitality and bid them farewell, we 
were walking past a mound of oak barrels in the distillery courtyard when 
Gordon Wright caught up with us. He thrust a bottle of his 21-year-old whiskey 
into my hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, take this," he said. "You'll find it tricky getting a bottle in the 
States." 
</P>
<P>
 I kept that bottle beside me as I wrote this. It proved to be an effective 
muse. Whenever I needed to transport myself from grimy urban America to the 
Kintyre Peninsula, I would simply take another sip and find myself back in malt 
whiskey country, the smell of peat and sea air heavy in the air, the promise of 
good single malt whiskey always nearby. GUIDEBOOK

By Robert M. Rauner, Rauner is a Bethesda, Md.-based free-lance writer and 
lifelong golfer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As I stood over the putt, my caddie said: "There's a little bump just before 
the hole. And, oh, by the way, don't take too long. I'm wet, my feet hurt and 
I'm starving." 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, this wasn't a regular caddie with lots of experience. She was 
(is) my wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, this wasn't my annual round at one of the Pinehurst, N.C. courses. 
Rather, it was at the Machrihanish Golf Club, at the southern end of Scotland's 
Kintyre Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd ended up over that putt, watched by my wife, because I had convinced her 
it would be rewarding to spend a week in the Argyll and Isles region of the 
Western Highlands. Why the Argyll and Isles? Partly because the area is so 
accessible from Glasgow, and my wife had just finished a conference there; 
partly because of the area's scenic beauty, and partly because I reckoned it 
would be a modest-cost trip. Oh, and partly because it just happens to have 30 
golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
 My intention was to construct an alternative to the high-priced guided tours 
of the great names in Scottish courses, such as St. Andrews and Troon. 
</P>
<P>
 These excursions obviously have a place in a serious golfer's experiences. 
But, they are hardly the way ordinary Scots, in their small towns, take their 
beloved game. 
</P>
<P>
 So, instead of an excursion, I wanted to golf the way the locals do: with 
frugality, easy access and a willingness to fit the game to what the terrain 
and local resources afford. I picked clubs that were accessible to the public. 
There would be no expansion clubhouses, no umbrella'd verandas, no constricting 
golf carts and cart paths. No, it would simply be: walk the round, carry the 
bag to the ball, pick a club and hit away. Just as the inventors of the game 
intended. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of our journey would be the Machrihanish Club, near Campbeltown. I 
had heard about this course during an earlier business trip to Scotland and 
vowed that I would play there.  
</P>
<P>
 Getting to Machrihanish and back in a week meant it was possible to play five 
or six other courses, several of them modest nine-hole designs that are known 
to fit imaginatively into their available terrain. Among those are Tarbert Golf 
Club, Lochgilphead Golf Club, and Inellan Golf Club, near Dunoon. Their pars 
range in the low 30s, but none are pushovers. In fact, at Lochgilphead Golf 
Club the course record for 18 holes is only two under its par 64. In this slice 
of Scotland, modest doesn't mean easy.  
</P>
<P>
 These small village courses have one endearing feature: the honor system. 
There is no pro shop, no caddiemaster or starter. The visitor is simply 
directed to place the green fee (usually $7.50-$10.50) in a designated box with 
a slot in the top.  
</P>
<P>
 So, our week-long tour would take us in a 400-mile loop from Glasgow, across 
the Firth of Clyde to the Island of Arran, thence to the Kintyre Peninsula. 
Next, a drive north would take us around the top of Loch Fyne, Scotland's 
largest lake, and down to Dunoon, on the Cowal Peninsula. Then, our route would 
go further south to the Isle of Bute, after which we'd close the loop by 
recrossing the Firth of Clyde back to Glasgow. 
</P>
<P>
 I picked up our rental car, an English Rover compact sedan, last August in 
Glasgow. With our gear loaded, we consulted our map and set out on Route A73 
for the ferry terminal at Ardrossan, about 35 miles southwest of Glasgow.  
</P>
<P>
 At Ardrossan our boarding of the ferry that makes the hour run to Brodick, on 
the Island of Arran, was a close call. We'd neglected to make a "booking," and 
the waiting area was full of cars whose owners had had more foresight. So, we 
had to queue in the somewhat forlorn "wait list" line. We got on the one or two 
spaces to spare. The ferry holds about 80 cars and 800 passengers and has a 
snack bar and lounge. Beyond us drivers, we observed lots of backpackers and 
bicyclists on board. Most were fitted with some kind of rainwear. A clue that 
they knew something we didn't? 
</P>
<P>
 Arran has been described as Scotland in miniature. In an area about 12 miles 
long and eight miles wide it has all the features of the mainland: mountains, 
rocky coastlines, valleys and glens, lakes, farms and small villages. It also 
produces some of the finest wool sweaters in the world, which is why sheep are 
everywhere: in the fields, alongside the roads. Road-kill natural selection 
evidently works. The unfenced survivors either grazed or reclined within inches 
of the road edges, blinking benignly as cars and trucks whizzed by. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We stayed in Brodick, the largest of several resort villages on the island, 
with a picturesque bay to the east. Across the bay is a clear view of 
2,800-foot Goat Fell, the island's tallest mountain and frequent destination of 
climbers. A clear view, that is, when it isn't raining. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather in mid-August proved highly changeable; one minute clear skies, 
then dark clouds, then a misty rain, then clear again. This variability didn't 
seem to trouble the locals, so we decided it wouldn't trouble us either.  
</P>
<P>
 On our first day in Brodick, I set out for the nearby Brodick Golf Club. My 
wife, who is an avid amateur photographer, explored Brodick Castle, the 
ancestral home for more than 500 years of the Dukes of Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
 The course turned out to be a medium-interest, somewhat flat bayside layout, 
wet from lots of rain. An engaging featureis that the first three holes, all 
par three, are in a field across the road from the clubhouse, completely 
separated from the rest of the course. These holes crisscross one another, so 
they can fit into the limited space. Not only that, parts of the fairways serve 
as a football field. So, golfers sometimes have to make way. I wondered, would 
my shriek of "fore!" mean anything to a bunch of sweaty soccer players? 
Luckily, there was no game in progress when I teed off. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, though, the three-par sector was closed and turned over to the 
annual Brodick Highland Games. Bagpipe competitions, hammer throws, caber 
tossing, foot races, and tug of wars all proceeded apace. All this competition 
was limited to the "Arran-born," with the homey touch that lots of contests 
were arranged for the children. 
</P>
<P>
 Out on the remainder of the course, play sometimes adjusted for elderly 
dog-walkers, youthful horseback riders, and individuals and families just out 
for a stroll. At the outset, this struck me as something of a nuisance. It 
didn't take long to realize, however, that it really was no big imposition. 
Golfing life and other leisure activities could coexist, and gentle tolerance 
for one another's needs marked a civilized way to spend a Scottish Sunday. Aye. 
Canny Scots! 
</P>
<P>
 Our hotel, the Arran, was in the three-point category (under the Scottish 
Tourist Board's four-point rating system). This meant it had most amenities, 
including an indoor pool. 
</P>
<P>
 We had made reservations at hotels and guest houses listed in catalogues 
prepared by the Scottish Tourist Board, prefering the three-pointers at about 
$40 per person per night for bed and breakfast. And breakfasts were so 
substantial that we could skip lunches. As for dinner, at the Arran Hotel, the 
dining room offered a good three-course dinner with a half-carafe of wine for 
about $18. With genuinely friendly guests, smiling care by the staff and an 
enthusiastic proprietor, holding easygoing views about golf and world politics, 
it didn't take long to get comfortable. This experience proved to be the norm 
for the rest of our trip.  
</P>
<P>
 The next day, while my wife pursued photo opportunities, I drove across the 
island to play at a links-type course, the Shiskine Golf and Tennis Club. Here, 
the terrain was generally left as wind, erosion, animals and other forces had 
shaped it. Apart from being transfixed by splendid views of Kilbrannan Sound 
and the Kintyre Peninsula to the west, the golfer confronts lots of uneven 
lies, wild dunes of unkempt rough and a dazzling array of blind shots. 
Shiskine's most unusual feature, though, is that it has only 12 holes, 
something unheard of in the States. Twelve tough holes were all that could be 
fitted into the available land. If that meant golfers had to repeat six of the 
holes to reach the full 18, so be it. The golfing challenge of par 65 was none 
the less for that. 
</P>
<P>
 The insouciance of this unusual layout was paralleled by that of the pro shop 
attendant. When I inquired the green fee and possible starting time, the 
ruddy-faced Scotsman said, "Aye. Nae problem. Aught pounds." Whereupon he put 
down the glass of whisky he had been sipping, took my money and wrote my name 
down opposite 10:08 on the starting time sheet. He pointed me toward the first 
tee, observing that "yer second shot's oop o'er tha' tall fairway boonker. Th' 
hole's hid beyont it." With that, he picked up his glass and resumed sipping. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Early the next morning we had breakfast and then set out on A841 around the 
western side of Arran to Lochranza, and a 30-minute ferry ride to the Kintyre 
Peninsula, whose southern end is about 18 miles from the coast of Northern 
Ireland. Our destination was seaside Campbeltown, where we were to stay in an 
elegantly restored manor house owned by two retired teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there, however, involved another aspect of Scottish frugality -- the 
"single track road with passing places," as the maps quaintly described it. 
These roads have enough room for only one vehicle, except every so often 
there's a wide spot where two can pass. Striped black-and-white poles mark 
these points. The local driving strategy seemed to be: Get to a wide spot; look 
ahead; if nothing's coming, race like the wind to the next pole. It appeared to 
all work, since we didn't see any evidence of head-on crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbeltown is a resort and fishing village of 6,000. At one time it had 34 
whisky distilleries; now there are two. Local lore has it that in the 
distilleries' heyday the aroma from them was so strong that sailors could find 
their way back to port in dense fogs just by the smell. Campbeltown has seven 
hotels, a large number of bed-and-breakfast houses, and several trailer 
(caravan) sites. It also has 13 pubs. 
</P>
<P>
 My reason for coming to Campbeltown, however, was not to imbibe. It was to 
play at the Machrihanish Golf Club, located a few miles outside the village. 
This much-acclaimed course lies alongside Machrihanish Bay. It is flat, 
treeless, full of mounds and hollows, and left generally in the land's original 
contours. But it has been judged the equal of any of the more famous Scottish 
links courses, including the Old Course at St. Andrews. Legend has it that 
"Old" Tom Morris, who won the British Open four times between 1861 and 1867, 
declared that the land on which the course lies "was designed by The Almighty 
for playing golf." 
</P>
<P>
 I settled my green free of about $20 and went out to what has been described 
as one of the finest starting holes anywhere. It's a stalwart 423-yard par four 
that follows the gentle curve of Machrihanish Bay and is a challenge for the 
brave. But No. 1 also protects the innocent. Just below it, on the beach, is a 
sign, simple and direct, like much else in Scotland: "DANGER. 1st Tee Above. 
Sitters Move Along Beach Clear of Golf Danger Area." 
</P>
<P>
 Since I was alone, I teed up and hit. (My wife would meet me on No. 18.) I 
could see a few other players at the far reaches of the course, but I felt as 
if the whole wonderful place was mine alone. Machrihanish confirmed everything 
I'd heard about it. I played in sunshine, wind, drizzle, and driving rain. The 
sandy soil quickly drained the downpours. The winds and rain called for every 
kind of shotmaking: bump-and-runs, low knockdowns, fades and draws. The greens 
were in excellent shape, but with deep and sweeping undulations that made 
putting a world-class test. At 6,228 yards the course was not long. The front 
nine has only one par three; the back nine has three, along with two par fives. 
But even so, it was all serious golfing work to stay within its par-70 reach. 
Needless to say, I didn't. On one hole I teed off into a deluge, sensing I'd 
hit the ball dead, solid, perfect. I never found it. I blamed my fogged-up 
glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 From Campbeltown, we drove back up A83 on the peninsula's western coast. Each 
turn in the highway gave another spectacular view of sea, mountains, and 
ever-changing clouds and skies. 
</P>
<P>
 We stopped overnight in the small town of Tarbert perched between West Tarbert 
Loch and Loch Fyne. Our hotel, the Columba, was right on Tarbert's busy harbor 
and just a short walk from the compact town center. Costs in Tarbert were about 
the same as in Brodick. 
</P>
<P>
 My golfing target was the Tarbert Golf Club, a hilly, tough little nine-hole 
course. The green fee here was $7.50. I sloshed around in many strokes over the 
par 33, but despite my sorry score, I was taken with the splendid views from 
holes that worked up and down and along some quite steep hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 From Tarbert we drove further along the A83 toward the top of Loch Fyne to the 
resort town of Lochgolphead, where I played another nine-holer, the 
Lochgilphead Golf Club.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From Lochgilphead, our route on A83 took us around the top of Loch Fyne, past 
Inveraray. Here is Inveraray Castle, home of the Duke of Argyll and traditional 
head of the Campbell Clan, one of the most powerful families for better than 
700 years of Scottish history. We then turned south to follow A815 along the 
eastern shore of Loch Fyne and then Loch Eck to our destination in Dunoon. 
</P>
<P>
 I intended to play at the Cowal Golf Club in Dunoon. But heavy rains had 
closed the course. With Cowal rained out, I substituted Inellan Golf Club, 
about four miles south.  
</P>
<P>
 The final stop on our tour was the resort and fishing village of Rothesay on 
the Isle of Bute. This entailed one more jaw-clenching drive over the dreaded 
"single-tracker" to reach the ferry that crosses the Kyles (a narrow inlet) of 
Bute at Colintrave. The short ride let us out on A886 and, thence, for about 12 
miles into the charming town. 
</P>
<P>
 Five hundred years ago, Scotland's ruling dynasty picked Rothesay as a hunting 
and vacation spot. The partly restored Rothesay Castle testifies to their 
presence. An active harbor, a conventional tourist strand and well-gardened 
esplanade serve the frequent day-trippers and conducted-tour vacationers. 
</P>
<P>
 My golfing target here was the Rothesay Golf Club, founded in 1892. This 
course overlooks Rothesay Bay and the Firth of Clyde. Overlooks, that is, once 
you reclaim your breath after climbing several hundred feet in elevation in 
order to complete the four-par, 251-yard first hole. From this hilltop are 
magnificent views of the Cowal Peninsula, Firth of Clyde, Arran, the Cumbrae 
Islands to the east, and beyond them the Ayrshire Coast. I joined two local 
club members in my round. They evidently played every day and traveled light: a 
few, well-worn clubs, small bags and some rain gear. We played each hole in 
about six minutes, except when I slowed things down with a lost ball and a 
snapshot on No. 8 tee. 
</P>
<P>
 Why No. 8? It was one of the flamboyant American golfer Walter Hagen's 
favorites. According to the pro shop attendant, at some time during one of 
Hagen's visits to the United Kingdom, he decided to play the course. When he 
got to No. 8, he assessed the challenge of the severe downhill, 204-yard par 
three, with little fairway and pronounced slopes from left-to-right feeding off 
into a similarly-sloped green. He turned to take in the broad scene of water, 
sky, hills, fields, houses, and then back to the hole and said: "If God gave me 
one last hole to play, this would be it." 
</P>
<P>
 We ended our week with an early-morning 30-minute ferry ride to Wemyss Bay and 
then about a 50-mile drive on A78 and M-8 straight to Glasgow Airport. The 
airport, albeit an international hub, is modest in scale and uncongested.  
</P>
<P>
 Our cost for two people for this eight days and about 400 miles of driving? 
Excluding airfares, lodgings came to $549 for double rooms, bed and breakfast; 
other meals $168; golf (for me) $88; car rental $454; gas $64; ferry charges 
$118. Total: $1,441. All costs included the U.K.'s 17% Value Added Tax (VAT), 
and with a rate of exchange at 1 to $1.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Scotland left many marks on us. I saw the other side of Scottish golfing life 
that I'd wondered about. Beyond that, Scotland's scenic grandeur and the 
openness and charm of its people drew us in. My wife remarked on one moment of 
particular meaning. As she was walking along a back street high above Brodick, 
she heard a faint bagpipe melody. The sounds came from a band marching to the 
day's Highland Games from the ferry pier. Out of sight, but with the colorful 
vista of Brodick Bay before her, the band's plaintive tune marked something 
poignant and touching. In its innocent way, that song encircled the gentle 
admonition we had seen on a sign beside the road as we were leaving Tarbert:

TRAVEL INSIDER: SUPREME COURT SAYS YES TO 'BUMPED' PASSENGER: HE CAN SUE THE 
AIRLINE; RULING: TICKET-HOLDERS WHO INVOLUNTARILY MISS FLIGHTS MAY SUE IN STATE 
COURTS, BUT NOT FOR BIG PUNITIVE AWARDS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 These are words that kindle fantasies of retribution in the minds of airline 
passengers: Montana lawyer William West, involuntarily bumped from a 1986 
flight from Great Falls to Washington, sues Northwest Airlines, wins and is 
upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court wrote the end of that tale on Feb. 21, when it refused to 
hear Northwest Airlines' appeal in the case.  
</P>
<P>
 But the case is not the victory for air travelers that it may seem. Industry 
authorities agree that involuntarily bumped passengers already had a right to 
sue in state courts for compensatory damages. What those passengers didn't have 
was the right to seek big-money punitive damages -- and they still don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years ago, when West was bumped from that flight to Washington, the 
airline offered him an alternative flight several hours later and $198 for his 
trouble. Instead, West turned down the offer and went to court in Montana 
seeking $10,000 in compensatory damages -- that is, money to cover actual 
losses he believes he suffered by missing out on a conference in Washington -- 
and $50,000 in punitive damages, to discourage the airline from continuing such 
practices. Northwest argued that the intercession of a state court in the 
matter would amount to trespassing on turf that should be covered by federal 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 After much legal wrangling, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals (which 
covers California and eight other Western states) last year ruled that West 
could seek the compensatory damages, but not punitive damages. The Supreme 
Court decision allowed that to stand. (In order to actually collect that 
$10,000, West will have to follow through and prevail in further litigation in 
lower courts.)  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think this really changes the airline-passenger relationship. All it 
does is reaffirm that under state laws, passengers have a right to sue," said 
Chris Chiames, spokesman for the Air Transport Assn., which lobbies for the 
airlines in Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 Cornish F. Hitchcock, an attorney for the Public Citizen Litigation Group who 
has worked on West's case since 1989, agreed that the case changes little for 
passengers. He noted that since 1962, federal law has provided that air 
passengers who are involuntarily bumped can either accept an airline's offer of 
compensation or take the issue to court. But awards have not been 
awe-inspiring. West's potential award of $10,000, Hitchcock said, probably 
amounts to less than the value of the attorney's time spent on the 8-year-old 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the average traveler who does not happen to be a lawyer," said Hitchcock, 
"we have found that taking either the money or a coupon (the usual make-good 
offerings volunteered by airlines) makes sense if your only loss is 
inconvenience or delay." 
</P>
<P>
 Many rules of bumping are laid out by federal law. Hitchcock summarized them 
this way: 
</P>
<P>
 When airlines are overbooked, employees typically ask for volunteers to take 
another flight in exchange for compensation, which can vary. If there aren't 
enough volunteers, the passengers who arrive at the gate last are often the 
first ones bumped. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are bumped from a flight originating in the U.S., your airline will 
probably try to place you on the next available flight to the same destination. 
If that flight is scheduled to arrive one to two hours later than your 
originally scheduled arrival time, Hitchcock said, the airline will generally 
refund up to $200. If the secondary flight is scheduled to deliver you more 
than four hours later than your originally scheduled arrival time, Hitchcock 
said, the standard refund is up to $400 or your original fare. Instead of cash, 
carriers may also offer coupons for domestic travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Compensation may not be required, however, if you arrive late at the gate 
yourself, if your flight is canceled altogether (thereby "bumping" everyone 
aboard), if circumstances force the airline to switch planes for a flight, if 
the airline bumps you up a class on your catch-up flight, or if your plane has 
60 or fewer seats. 
</P>
<P>
 How often are passengers involuntarily bumped? The federal Department of 
Transportation, which monitors airline performance, calculates that among the 
nine major U.S. airlines, roughly one passenger in 10,000 is involuntarily 
bumped. But the figures can vary widely. 
</P>

<P>
 Correction: On Feb. 13, I mentioned that Egypt had recently changed policy and 
begun admitting travelers with South African stamps on their passports. In 
fact, Egyptian tourism officials say, they have admitted such travelers for 
many years.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; A STARRY STORY AT FRENCH HOTELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, Paris bureau 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nothing brings a smile to the face of a French chef so quickly as the prospect 
of adding a Michelin star or a GaultMillau toque (baker's hat) to his or her 
nameplate. 
</P>
<P>
 But, for some years now, French hotels have tried to avoid being tagged with 
the government tourism ministry's top rating -- a "luxury" four-star. That 
honor may have been good for the image, but there were thorns in the crown, the 
sharpest being the 18.6% French VAT that they were forced to tack onto guests' 
bills. All the other hotels in the country, from one-star up to (non-"luxury") 
four-star, could get away with a 5.5% tax. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year the government quietly did away with the four-star "luxury" 
category -- and, effectively, the higher tax on those hotel rooms. The top 
hotels, hit hard by the worldwide recession, had lobbied for the change. And 
many were reluctant to upgrade their facilities for fear of an increase in room 
rates due to the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, few hotels carried the top rating and many had purposely taken steps 
to avoid it. Only four Paris hotels -- the Georges V, the Hotel de Crillon, the 
Scribe and the Meurice -- were "luxury four-star" facilities, a rating due 
mostly to the size of their rooms. (Each room had to be at least two square 
yards larger than an "ordinary" four-star hotel room.) 
</P>
<P>
 Now France has 505 hotels, one-fourth of the total, in the four-star category. 
That amounts to 37,000 rooms, a drop of more than a third in the past decade 
due to the disappearance of big-spending business executives, mostly from the 
Middle East countries. The average price of a four-star hotel in France today 
is $230 per room, per night. 
</P>
<P>
 Having won their battle against the higher taxes, many of the top hotels now 
are asking the government to introduce a five-star category, at the lower tax 
rate. And the government seems so inclined. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the mayor of Paris, in a bid to raise money for developing business 
tourism, this year instituted a special accommodations tax in France's largest 
city. But few tourists will notice the new taxe de sejour , which will range 
from about 17 cents a night per person at campsites to $1.20 a night in the 
most luxurious lodgings. SCOTT KRAFT, Paris bureau

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; ANOTHER DELAY IN THE CHUNNEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Operators of the Channel Tunnel that will connect England and France say the 
costly and oft-delayed project has hit another snag and that services set to 
begin in coming weeks will be delayed again. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Eurotunnel, the French-English company that built and 
operates the so-called "Chunnel," stressed last week that routine testing of 
trains and track is responsible for the delay and that "no fundamental (safety) 
problem has emerged." 
</P>
<P>
 Cargo transportation through the Chunnel on Le Shuttle trains, set to begin 
Monday, will be the first service affected. Officials said service will start 
in several weeks, but did not specify a date. The opening of Le Shuttle service 
for cars, set for May 8, also will face a delay, operators say. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the official inauguration of the facility -- with no less than Queen 
Elizabeth II and France's President Francois Mitterrand presiding -- will go on 
as planned on May 6, a Eurotunnel spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eurostar -- the passenger trains that will whisk riders between London and 
Paris in about three hours via the tunnel -- is set to begin limited service 
sometime in July, spokesmen said.

CRUISE VIEWS: CARNIVAL TAKES AIM WITH TWO NEW SHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH, Slater and Basch travel as guests of the 
cruise lines. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Between last Thanksgiving and Christmas, Carnival Corp. introduced two new 
ships -- the 2,600-passenger, $300-million Sensation for its Carnival Cruise 
Lines, and the 1,266-passenger, $250-million Maasdam for its Holland America 
Line. 
</P>
<P>
 Although under the same ownership, the two ships and their on-board lifestyles 
are so different that it would be difficult indeed to switch passengers from 
one to the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from trying to offer all things to all passengers, Carnival appears to 
target types of travelers. The Carnival "fun ships" have been touted on TV for 
so long that everybody who's ever seen a newscast has a general idea of what 
the cruises must be like -- filled with glitter, glitz and nonstop fun. (One 
great relief -- you don't have Cathy Lee Gifford pop into your cabin from the 
TV set the way she does in the commercial.) 
</P>
<P>
 This is cruising that is meant to dazzle the average American, to "knock their 
socks off," as one travel writer said. The trio of vessels that began with the 
Fantasy, then the Ecstasy and now the Sensation (the Fascination is due in 
October) are more like adult amusement parks than cruise ships, and they are 
real crowd-pleasers. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you're looking for peace, quiet and solitude, head the other way, 
perhaps toward the Maasdam. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sensation alternates eastern and western Caribbean seven-day cruises round 
trip from Miami, with Sunday departures. Eastern itineraries call at San Juan 
and St. Thomas, while western itineraries visit Playa del Carmen and Cozumel, 
Grand Cayman and Ocho Rios. Prices range from $1,349 to $2,429 per person, 
double occupancy, including round-trip air fare from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maasdam repositions to Alaska for the summer, beginning May 17, with 
seven-day round-trip sailings from Vancouver through the Inside Passage, 
calling in Ketchikan, Juneau and Sitka, and cruising Glacier Bay. Fares range 
from $1,545 to $5,995 per person, double occupancy, plus air add-ons of $395 
from Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 When we joined the Sensation's three-day sailing for travel writers agents in 
mid-November, there were enough sequins on the passengers to out-flash the 
neon-outlined glass elevators in the seven-deck-high atrium. A 23-foot 
sculpture by Israeli artist Eliezer Weishoff, part of the $1-million art 
collection on board, towers over the reception desk like a pastel perpetual 
motion machine with phallic-like rods and bars following computer-programmed 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ship designer Joe Farcus is fascinated with technological toys. In a bar, 
table tops twinkle with fiber-optic "snakes," and even the walls in the public 
areas seem to move as they throb with wavy lights, thanks to 
computer-controlled neon panels. The only major feature not in place from the 
beginning (it is now up and working, we are told) was the Sensation Boulevard 
"sounds of nature" walk, designed to create three different "natural 
environments" with soothing intermittent sound effects of waves, bird song and 
rain. Now, thanks to technology, passengers can sit under twinkling fiber-optic 
trees and listen to recorded bird song. 
</P>
<P>
 On that first sailing, the disco reverberated into the wee hours, people lined 
up three-deep at the midnight buffet, and in the show lounge, the spectacle and 
special effects on stage rivaled Las Vegas. (The proscenium opening is 18 
inches higher than on the previous sister ships so dancers can enter wearing 
taller headdresses.) 
</P>
<P>
 In the 185-square-foot cabins, spacious for this price range, TV sets play 
feature films around the clock, and you can order a room-service sandwich at 4 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Club Vegas casino jingles as long as at least one night owl remains, with 
228 slot machines, 20 blackjack tables, three roulette wheels, three dice 
tables and three poker tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks later, when the ringing in our ears had subsided, we flew to Costa 
Rica to join the Maasdam for three days at the end of its inaugural cruise, 
joining a shore-excursion bus at a San Jose museum for the long ride back to 
Puerto Limon, where the ship was docked. 
</P>
<P>
 Our fellow excursion passengers were amiable and sedate, most past retirement 
age. The Maasdam is sumptuous and subdued, with some of its most elegant public 
rooms, interestingly, created by Carnival's Farcus, with no neon and few fiber 
optics in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-deck Crows Nest bar doubles as an observation lounge and carries an 
Alaska theme, with craggy "mountains" of granite in bas-relief around the walls 
and grained cross-sections of wood forming the floor, table tops and bar top. A 
subtle, free-form cascade of fiber optics on the ceiling suggests waterways. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rembrandt Show Lounge has fluted mahogany columns, Delft tiles and a 
brocade fabric in red and blue shot through with gold, giving the impression of 
walking into a tasteful drawing room in the 17th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside cabins are a roomy 196 square feet, insides 186, with six cabins 
equipped for disabled travelers. All have sitting areas and big closets. 
Besides a lavish penthouse suite, there are 28 suites with Jacuzzi bathtubs and 
private verandas, and 120 deluxe staterooms with safes, mini-bars, TVs with 
VCRs and private verandas. 
</P>
<P>
 While always serving the best breakfast and lunch buffets at sea, the 
121-year-old Holland America Line is also becoming more sophisticated at dinner 
time; the food aboard is better than ever, with a low-fat, low-sodium option 
offered at every meal. 
</P>
<P>
 The two newest Holland America ships, Statendam and Maasdam, suggest that this 
high-quality company, if not yet in the ultra-luxurious Crystal Cruises, Royal 
Cruise Line and Royal Viking Line class, is certainly headed in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming up between now and 1997 are six more new ships for Carnival companies, 
bringing their total to more than $3 billion worth of hardware for the 1990s. 
Three of the new vessels meant to carry the Carnival brand will be similar to 
the Sensation, while two others will be sister ships in the Maasdam class for 
Holland America. The largest, a 95,000-ton vessel capable of carrying 3,300 
passengers, will also carry the Carnival label. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from worrying about overbuilding, Micky Arison, chairman of Carnival, says 
new-ship introductions create excitement that helps expand the cruise market, 
and that the public will keep coming as long as someone creates an environment 
they want. 
</P>
<P>

327-7276 for the Sensation, (800) 626-9900 for the Maasdam.

HIKING: TIJUANA RIVER: NEAR TIJUANA, A RIVER MARSH WORTH ITS SALT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At first glance, Tijuana River Estuary, one of the few salt marshes remaining 
in Southern California, looks lifeless. But a closer look -- or a look through 
binoculars -- might reveal a marsh hawk, brown pelican, California gull, 
black-necked stilt, snowy egret, Western sandpiper and American kestrel -- to 
name a few of the more common birds. 
</P>
<P>
 The estuary, about 1 1/2 miles north of the border dividing Baja and 
California, 15 miles south of San Diego, is an essential breeding ground and 
feeding and nesting spot for more than 170 species of native and migratory 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
 A flotilla of land-use agencies have shared control of what is officially 
known as the Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve: the California 
Department of Parks and Recreation, the California Department of Fish and Game, 
and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest challenge facing these agencies -- and the biggest threat to the 
estuary -- is sewage discharges from Tijuana. The fast-growing city sometimes 
empties sewage into the Tijuana River, which in turn empties into the estuary. 
Border Field State Park and the estuary have been closed to public use several 
times as a result of such sewage spills. In addition, nearby Imperial Beach and 
Silver Strand State Beach are occasionally closed due to sewage-related

</P>
<P>
 The various resource agencies staff a nice visitor center that interprets 
marshland ecology. One good source of information is the pamphlet, "A Walker's 
Guide: The Natural History of the Tijuana National Estuarine Reserve." The 
brochure lists some of the more common birds and plants found in the reserve. 
Guided nature walks take place on Thursday afternoons and Saturday mornings. 
</P>
<P>
 From the visitor center, trails lead into the estuary and continue all the way 
to the Tijuana River mouth. At times of low water and low tide, the river can 
be safely crossed, but at times of high water and high tide, crossing can be 
very dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fifth Street and Iris, a second signed trail leads into the estuary. The 
path parallels the Ream Field boundary fence. On weekdays, you're sure to see 
more helicopters hovering over this stretch of trail than appeared in 
"Apocalypse Now." Most first-time visitors figure that they must be U.S. Border 
Patrol copters searching for illegal immigrants crossing the border. Actually, 
the helicopters from Ream Field are flown by Navy pilots who are practicing 
their takeoffs, landings and air-sea rescues. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the estuary is almost flat, it's not completely flat, and very small 
changes in elevation bring changes in vegetation. At higher elevations are 
hillocks of coastal scrub, and at the very lowest elevations are mud flats. 
Between is a marshland of pickleweed and cordgrass. 
</P>
<P>
 For an interesting return route or an addition to your marsh hike, take a walk 
along wide, sandy Imperial Beach. Imperial Beach was named by the South San 
Diego Improvement Co. around the turn of the century to help lure Imperial 
Valley residents to build summer cottages on the beach. Waterfront lots could 
be purchased for $25 down and $25 monthly, and developers promised the balmy 
climate would "cure rheumatic proclivities, catarrhal trouble, lesions of the 
lungs," and a wide assortment of other ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 In more recent times, what was once a narrow beach protected by a seawall has 
been widened considerably by sand dredged from San Diego Bay. There's good 
swimming and surfing along Imperial Beach , and the waves can get huge. Wander 
up to Imperial Pier, built in 1912 and the oldest in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: From Interstate 5 in Imperial Beach, exit on Palm 
Avenue. Go west 2 1/2 miles to Third Street. Turn left and drive half a mile to 
the visitor center parking lot for the Tijuana River National Estuarine 
Research Reserve. Tijuana Estuary Trails

TAKING THE KIDS: AWESOME FAMILY VACATION, DUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN OGINTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sandi Fellows' idea of a good vacation is sitting by the pool with a book -- 
certainly not bumping up and down on a horse all day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what it's like to be around smelly animals. I grew up on a farm," the 
44-year-old San Diego resident said. "To me ranching and farming is work." 
</P>
<P>
 But good mom that she is, Fellows gamely went along to a Colorado dude ranch 
with her husband, an airline pilot, and two kids. "I thought I'd get through 
it," she said. "I didn't equate ranching with fun." 
</P>
<P>
 She couldn't have been more surprised. "I had the time of my life. It was the 
best family vacation we ever had," reported Fellows, whose daughter was 12 and 
son, 7, when the family visited the Latigo Ranch in Kremmling, Colo. Her son 
even wrote a six-page report for school about the experience. Two friends they 
made there even joined them afterward at Sandi Fellows' mother's farm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was perfect for city slickers and old farm girls like me who didn't want 
to rough it anymore," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dude ranches have been around for nearly a century, started when adventurous 
Easterners asked for a chance to experience life on a Western cattle ranch, 
according to a spokesman for the Dude Ranchers' Assn., which now numbers more 
than 100 members. 
</P>
<P>
 Those first turn-of-the-century guests paid just $10 a week to ride and relax 
far away from their homes. Today's visitors spend nearly 10 times that. But 
ranching has never been more popular, as growing numbers of families discover 
it can be an antidote to the pressures of urban and suburban life that also 
teaches kids about working with nature. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an easy vacation to plan. "You know ahead of time exactly what you're 
going to spend," said Dave Wiggins, whose company American Wilderness 
Experience arranged the Fellows' trip and books ranch vacations for families at 
more than 50 properties across the West (call 800-444-Dude). 
</P>
<P>
 Today's ranches offer fishing, rafting, swimming, hiking, nature lessons, even 
sightseeing, and at some places, tennis and excellent food. The price is 
moderate: typically $3,000-$3,500 for a family of four, including meals, 
accommodations and activities. 
</P>
<P>
 (For a $5 national directory of ranches, call the Dude Ranchers' Assn. at 
303-223-8440. A directory of more than 40 Colorado Ranches is available free 
from Colorado Dude and Guest Ranch Assn. Call 303-724-3653. The Arizona Office 
of Tourism also will provide a list of ranches. Call 602-542- 8687.) 
</P>
<P>
 My daughter Reggie and I spent a wonderful two days at the Tanque Verde Guest 
Ranch in Tucson in November, joining another family at dinner (the food was 
plentiful and tasty) and a group of parents and kids for an early-morning ride 
up the hills filled with huge saguaro cacti. "My favorite part was the pool and 
going up the rocky mountains," Reggie said. Mine was the dramatic scenery seen 
from horseback. (Call Tanque Verde at 602-296-6275.) 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't too many places in the country that offer a safe haven where mom 
and dad can relax and not have to worry about the kids," said Gene Kilgore, 
author of "Gene Kilgore's Ranch Vacations," (John Muir Publications, $19,95), 
noting that growing numbers of ranches now offer children's programs. "What's 
important is the value -- the whole family being together and enjoying the 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Potential visitors should remember that ranches are usually small, hosting 
fewer than 50 guests, and that they're not all alike. That's why it's important 
to find out in advance if the one selected can fulfill family needs. Call and 
talk to the ranch owner. Ask how old the children must be to ride. (Most 
programs start at age 6, although some offer programs for younger children.) 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Mishkin was disappointed with the difficult time she had finding care 
for her 13-month-old at Tanque Verde Ranch. Mishkin, who lives in Old Chatham, 
N.Y., nonetheless had a good time, as did her husband and two older children. 
"The naturalist was the best part of the week," she said. "The kids even 
learned how to track wild animals." Yet Mishkin advises prospective families, 
"Wait until the kids are old enough to ride."

TASTE OF TRAVEL: CONNECTICUT; SWEET TRADITION; IN A WORLD OF STERILE 
MECHANIZATION, MAPLE SUGARING REMAINS MUCH AS IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNE LEBLANC, Leblanc is an editor at The Hartford Courant and a 
free-lance writer who lives in Burlington, Conn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the messy cold of late winter in the backwoods of southern New England, 
metal buckets begin to appear on the trunks of the sugar maples. Somewhere 
nearby I know there will be a hand-painted sign pointing to a wooden 
sugarhouse. If steam is billowing out of the roof vents, the sugar maker is 
certainly sugaring off. 
</P>
<P>
 I donned my boots for the short walk from my car to Rob Lamothe's Sugarhouse 
in Burlington, on the edge of a woods packed with bare branches and snow laden 
pines. Evaporating sap simmered over a wood fire tended by Lamothe, a burly 
bearded man decked out in backwoods garb: a plaid flannel shirt, blue jeans, 
suspenders and boots. His wife, Jean, stood guard over the sales counter, 
vending some of the best syrup I've ever tasted and the creamiest maple sugar 
candy on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 This was rather a personal journey for me. I was 9 years old when my family 
moved here from Upstate New York and I immediately fell in love with the woods 
and the fresh streams and farms nearby. In early spring I learned to love the 
tradition of sugar making that takes place to this day in the woods all around. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is 1994 and like all Connecticut sugar makers this time of year, 
Lamothe is incredibly busy. Most days of the year he's simply a machinist, but 
in February and March, when the sap is running, he also becomes a sugar maker 
-- before work, after work, on weekends, every spare minute of the day. Pursued 
the old-fashioned way like this, the process is labor intensive. An average 
tree yields about 40 gallons of sap in a season, about enough to boil down into 
a single gallon of syrup. Yet in a good year Lamothe manages to make 400 to 500 
gallons, tapping trees around town and paying the landowners back in syrup. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an alluring kind of solitude that comes from working in the woods, 
Lamothe says; a strong connection with nature and with the past. But Lamothe 
gets the most satisfaction from knowing he is carrying on a family tradition 
that began in Quebec, as well as passing that tradition on to his children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It brings you back in touch with your ancestors. I'm doing something my 
great-great-grandfather did," he said, although it was from library books that 
Lamothe learned the technique, not his family, who had abandoned the practice 
in favor of full-time factory work when they moved to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The sap Lamothe brings in from the woods looks and tastes like water, and 
that's mostly what it is. But after hours of boiling -- after it has reached a 
substantial sugar content of 66% -- he draws off the resulting syrup into 
plastic jugs. And on weekends -- when the sugarhouse is full of visitors -- he 
pours some of the buttery-sweet syrup into tiny plastic cups and hands it 
around for sampling. 
</P>
<P>
 Most maple sap is made into syrup (about $8-$12 for a quart), but some 
sugarhouses -- such as Lamothe's -- also make a maple cream spread ($6 for 
eight ounces), crystallized maple sugar ($6 for eight ounces) and maple sugar 
candy ($9 for eight ounces) during the season. Some even give out free snow 
cones made of maple syrup drizzled over fresh snow. 
</P>
<P>
 This is, sadly, an endangered experience. Technology has invaded the forests 
and the sugarhouses, transforming the winter pastime of Colonial farmers into 
an industry. In much of Canada and some parts of New England, metal collection 
buckets have been abandoned and sap is drawn from trees by plastic tubes 
leading to mammoth barrels, making the forests look as if they're on 
intravenous feeding. The sap is boiled off in factories and stored for years in 
warehouses. Sugarbushes (as wild stands of sugar maples are called) are 
fertilized by crop dusters. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional methods persist, to varying degrees, in small sugarhouses 
throughout New England and Upstate New York, but I prefer to hunt maple sugar 
around home in Connecticut. In Vermont, for example, the big business of 
sugaring to me has an industrial flavor. But in Connecticut, maple sugaring is 
still exclusively small business. It is easier to step back in time here, and 
that is what I like about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sugarhouses like Lamothe's come about as close to traditional maple sugaring 
as you can find in the Northeast and it is not all that difficult to erase a 
century or two from the scene. Imagine that the pickup truck bearing barrels of 
sap is a horse-drawn wagon and that the big metal evaporator is a big iron 
kettle. Not much else has changed, and what has changed is discretely tucked 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not as charming to the tourist exploring the rural areas, the 
technology does have advantages. Lamothe points out that the plastic tubing 
method protects the trees from damage caused by sugar makers treading upon 
roots to empty buckets that fill up quickly. And even Lamothe has invested in a 
modern contraption called a reverse-osmosis machine, which is carefully hidden 
away in the back of the sugarhouse. This single machine can draw 75% of the 
water from the sap, substantially shortening the boiling time and, in so doing, 
saving wood. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 miles away at the Flanders Nature Center in Woodbury, no such 
machinery is found. The private, nonprofit facility is dedicated to preserving 
local flora and fauna and related traditions. Tucked deep into the woods, its 
sugarhouse is stacked to the rafters with split wood to fuel its evaporator. 
Free sugar making demonstrations are offered every Saturday and Sunday in 
March, from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m., and if the sap is running, children are invited 
to help empty the buckets. The syrup is sold at the gift shop in the center's 
main building. 
</P>
<P>
 From the volunteer sugar makers at the Nature Center I learned that Native 
Americans taught early Colonists the techniques for extracting sap from trees 
and boiling it down into syrup. They also shared their methods for making 
sugar, which keeps longer and is more portable than syrup -- two 
characteristics important to the semi-nomadic Native Americans of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Gazing deep into woods, where the buckets dangle from the trees around the 
sugarhouse, I got a sense of what Lamothe means: that only by standing near the 
sugarhouses can you feel the link between us and the Native Americans who 
boiled sap here in hollowed-out logs, so many years before. 
</P>
<P>
 A 10-minute drive down the road in the town of Southbury, David and Betsy 
Stiles make about 100 gallons of syrup a season on the land David's family has 
farmed since 1638. The family's sugar making tradition reaches at least as far 
back as Stiles' great-grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the family's rustic sugarhouse, Stiles sits on a tree trunk and tosses 
wood into the fire in the bottom of a shining copper evaporator that he swears 
makes better syrup than the modern stainless steel models. With his son, 
Benjamin, already helping out with the sugar making, Stiles knows the 
sugar-making tradition will continue for at least another generation. But even 
though he is 79, he sees no reason to quit. "I'll keep sugaring as long as I 
can," he said. GUIDEBOOK

 Getting there: Burlington is about 20 miles west of Hartford. Southbury and 
Woodbury are about 45 miles southwest of Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
 If driving from New York City, take Interstate 95 (in the Bronx) northeast 
into Connecticut, then turn north on Connecticut 8. 
</P>
<P>
 To get to Southbury and Woodbury from Connecticut 8, go west (about 15 miles) 
to Exit 15 (Connecticut 6). The exit is at Southbury and Woodbury is several 
miles north. 
</P>
<P>
 To get to Burlington, take Connecticut 8 north to Exit 42 (Connecticut 4), 
then go east a few miles into town. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finding sugarhouses: For directions contact individual sugarhouses. Weekends 
are the best bet for catching a glimpse of the sugaring process because so many 
sugar makers are hobbyists who pursue the activity on their days off. Weather 
is the key. Cold nights and warmer days make the sap run; if it falls below 20 
degrees overnight and reaches 45 degrees by mid-morning, a five-gallon pail 
will be overflowing by noon. If it gets too warm, the trees will bud and it 
will be over.

 Buying syrup: Maple syrup travels and keeps well. It is usually packaged in 
plastic bottles or metal cans, which should be refrigerated after opening. 
Larry Myatt, maple agent for the University of Vermont Extension Service, 
advises transferring syrup to a glass container to protect the flavor. It will 
keep forever if frozen in small batches, which can be reheated on a stove, he 
said. Maple candy and maple butter should be eaten fresh.

March and sometimes a few weeks in April, TVs at the local airport, Bradley 
International Airport in Windsor Locks, Conn., run videos about maple sugaring 
in the state. Connecticut's State Department of Economic Development also has 
information booths at the airport where brochures with the locations of 
sugarhouses are distributed for free.

DESTINATION: AUSTRALIA; DIG THIS TOWN; VISITORS VENTURE TO THE OUTBACK'S COOBER 
PEDY TO 'NOODLE' FOR OPALS AND STAY IN UNDERGROUND HOTELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The bleak lunar landscape, pockmarked by thousands of potholes, craters and 
chalky white mounds, loomed up toward us as we gently descended in our little 
twin-engined craft. Astronauts on a moon landing? Hardly. But a sense of 
excitement gripped us as our Saab turbo-prop plane from Adelaide touched down 
at Coober Pedy, the unique "underground town" in the arid outback of South 
Australia. A hand-lettered sign on the shack-like terminal building spelled 
out: "Welcome to Coober Pedy -- Opal Capital of the World." 
</P>
<P>
 A lone airport worker, a dark-haired young woman, met our Kendell Airlines 
flight -- the drowsy airport's total traffic for the day. She tossed our hefty 
suitcase into a mini-van, climbed behind the wheel and asked which of the 
town's half-dozen accommodations we were headed for. Our slung cameras and 
bug-eyed looks served to emblazon the label "Tourist" across our chests. My 
wife, Simone, and I were booked at the Desert Cave Hotel, eager, yet a bit 
wary, to experience its advertised claim: "The World's Only Underground Hotel." 
</P>
<P>
 On earlier visits Down Under, we had talked of getting away from Australia's 
big coastal cities and heading for the red desert heartland. Especially 
intriguing was the legendary Coober Pedy. We knew that maximum daytime 
temperatures here, capable of soaring from 95 to 115 degrees for eight months 
of the year, had brought about a lifestyle of "dugout" cave-style dwelling. A 
network of undergound shops, accommodations, restaurants and churches sheltered 
the Coober Pedians from the scorching heat, occasional stifling dust storms, 
and swarming desert flies that afflict the austral summer between December and 
February. We had planned our trip for the relatively "milder" Australian winter 
(June-August), and the temperatures hoovered in the 70s during the day.  
</P>
<P>
 But the mining of opals is really what Coober Pedy is all about.  
</P>
<P>
 Chauffeuring us into town last July, Laura Campagna was a mine of information. 
"Most of the world's opals come from Australia, and most of those stones are 
dug up right around here," she said. "It tallies up to $20 to $40 million 
dollars' worth a year." 
</P>
<P>
 We had heard that fortune-seeking adventurers trekked to Coober Pedy from all 
over the world, lured by the "Queen of Gems." The town's population of 5,000, 
Laura told us, included 42 different nationalities. This was no simple ethnic 
mix. It was probably the most motley work force outside Babel or the U.N. 
Building in New York. Laura dropped us off at the hotel, in the heart of town. 
With typical outback friendliness she invited us to stop in to the sightseeing 
office or souvenir shop anytime, even if just to say "G'day!" 
</P>
<P>
 Our underground hotel room, a cube-like chamber burrowed into the side of a 
hill, reposed about 13 feet below a solid rock surface. A door led out into the 
open air, but the pink sandstone walls produced the effect of a snug crypt -- 
complete with air-conditioning, television and international telephone. Whorled 
patterns on the striated walls, like giant fingerprints, were the telltale 
marks of powerful tunneling machines that had hollowed out this room. In the 
rambling subterranean hotel arcade, illuminated only by electric lights, we 
found an art gallery, a well-stocked bookshop, cozy bar, theatre, and, for 
sure, shops selling opals. The hotel also maintained aboveground rooms for 
claustrophobic guests. Upstairs, a first-class restaurant featured 
international cuisine, as well as local dishes such as pan-fried crocodile 
tail, oven-baked kangaroo fillet with strawberry and cassis sauce and 
medallions of char-grilled water buffalo.  
</P>
<P>
 Venturing outside, we surveyed the scene on Hutchinson Street, the town's main 
drag, named in honor of Willie Hutchinson, the 14-year-old youngster who 
"founded" Coober Pedy. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 1, 1911, Willie was left to look after a desert base camp while a 
group of gold prospectors, including his father, went in search of water. It 
was during one of Australia's worst droughts. When the men returned 
empty-handed after dark and found Willie missing, they grew anxious and 
prepared to light a signal fire. But a grinning Willie stumbled into camp, 
announcing he had found pieces of precious opal. And water too. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days more opal was discovered, eventually leading to the establishment 
of the town. Tragically, young Willie drowned five years later in a swimming 
accident in Queensland. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dust-blown Hutchinson Street, astir with general stores, gas stations, cafes 
and pickup trucks, has all the atmosphere of a frontier mining town, the feel 
of the old American Wild West. But a close-up look reveals how different it 
really is. Worshipers emerge from an underground church hewn out of solid 
sandstone; at the busy post office wall notices advertise: "Dugout Home for 
Sale, 3 bedrooms, large lounge, office, wall-to-wall carpeting, rainwater tank, 
fully-tiled bathroom, $55,000." (About half of Coober Pedians live in private 
homes underground.) Other ads suggest miners ready to move on, having made 
their fortunes, or gone broke: "For Sale, Second-hand opal-cutting machines. 
Tunneling machine. Blower/Extractor." 
</P>
<P>
 But 100,000 visitors pass through here every year, most of them en route to 
Ayers Rock and Alice Springs, 450 miles north. The opal dealers of Hutchinson 
Street transact a brisk business, often entertaining bargain-hunting customers 
with embellished tales of Coober Pedy's rough and ready past. Stories about 
"Moonlight" Burgess, the notorious opal bandit, or "Carney" Jimmy, the miserly 
miner who feasted on lizards. At both ends of Hutchinson Street's half-mile 
stretch lies the harsh, treeless desert that surrounds the town. An inland sea 
100 million years ago, the outback in South Australia, the driest state in the 
world's driest continent, is inhabited today by dingoes, wild camels and 
kangaroos. About six miles north of Coober Pedy stands the 5,950-mile-long "Dog 
Fence," a chain-link fence winding across Australia from coastal Queensland to 
South Australia to protect grazing sheep in the eastern part of the country 
from dingoes, the fierce desert dogs that roam the outback. Aussies claim it's 
the longest fence in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Although opal mining is not allowed within the town limits, the perimeter and 
beyond are littered with conically-shaped heaps of mullock (waste dirt) piled 
next to thousands of drill-holes where mine shafts have been sunk. 
</P>
<P>
 A permit to dig in one of the 75 fields around Coober Pedy is easy to obtain. 
For $35 the Department of Mines and Energy will let you "peg" your claim to a 
50-square-meter area for a year. But only individuals can mine. No companies. 
You must be at least 16 years old (Willie Hutchinson wouldn't qualify.) In 
fact, according to locals, many Coober Pedy visitors have stayed on, enticed by 
the prospect of unearthling lodes of the rainbow-colored gemstones. 
</P>
<P>
 Miners often pool their efforts, sharing equipment and splitting profits. 
Instead of the old method of dynamiting, the modern mining technique employs a 
high-powered tunneling machine with a steel-bladed rotating head that chomps 
into earth and rocks with a meter-wide bite. A truck-mounted mechanical 
monster, thundering like a huge vacuum cleaner, then moves in, whooshes the 
debris to the surface and spits it into huge piles to be scrutinized for traces 
of opal. When all the opal is believed removed, the rubble is abandoned to the 
"noodlers." "Noodlers," (or "fossickers") are those hopeful souls, mostly 
housewives, tourists, children, even miners on their day off, who scour the 
mullock mounds with tin sieves, trowels or bare hands for any overlooked 
leftovers. More sophisticated noodlers use a conveyor belt to pass the discard 
under an ultraviolet light that makes opal look yellow. Unique among gemstones, 
opals gain their beauty from the brilliant play of colors created by the 
breaking up of white light into the iridescent colors of the spectrum. Layers 
of tiny silica spheres produce this diffraction when the stone is rotated in a 
bright light. 
</P>
<P>
 Most treasured of all are the black opals whose dark (black, blue or gray) 
background enhances the flaming bursts of red, gold, blue and green. Lesser in 
value are the crystal clear and milky-white opals. If you are not au fait with 
the world of opals, the Hutchinson Street experts are quick to tell you that 
solid opals, cut in rounded cabochon style, will cost you much more than a 
"doublet" (thin slices of opal glued to a dark backing) or a "triplet" (a clear 
quartz cover topping a "doublet" to intensify the stone's luster and shield its 
delicate surface). 
</P>
<P>
 If the opal sellers perceive you to be a connoisseur, they'll bring out the 
expensive trays of harlequins, with dazzling patchwork patterns, or pinfires, 
with closely-spaced blazing specks of varied colors. Quality stones like these 
sell for hundreds, even thousands of dollars per carat. Afford it or not, few 
tourists leave Coober Pedy empty-handed, as crude bits of flawed opal are 
freely available to take home as souvenirs.

 Before ending our five-day stay, Simone and I called on the mayor at City 
Hall. We had met tall, affable, Cyprus-born Eric Malliotis the night before at 
his cheerful little restaurant on Hutchinson Street. He had not only cooked our 
tasty fried fish dinner -- of locally popular barramundi -- but had personally 
served us, adding on a huge pile of French fries and ice cream for dessert. 
Neither did he spare the wine. Our extended conversation had ranged from Middle 
Eastern politics to Aboriginal folk medicine. As we left at midnight closing 
time, Malliotis asked us to stop by his office in the morning. He had something 
"special" to show us. 
</P>
<P>
 In his brick-walled, aboveground cubbyhole office at City Hall, Malliotis, in 
open-necked shirt, welcomed us warmly, proudly holding a letter on White House 
stationery signed by President George Bush. The mayor explained that he had 
presented an opal and a wooden nameplate to the President at an official 
reception in Canberra when Bush visited Australia in early 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Bush and I had a memorable visit to Australia," wrote President Bush. 
"The only drawback was we missed the pleasure of visiting Coober Pedy . . . "

 I looked at my wife and smiled. I'm glad we didn't," I said. GUIDEBOOK

GEAR & GADGETS; NEW FOR THE CAMERA BAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDI DASH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone, it seems, has been bitten by the photo bug. Whereas not so many 
years ago only professional photographers and serious amateurs carried 
equipment more complex than a simple point-and-shoot, the increasingly 
automated nature of sophisticated cameras has made more versatile models 
increasingly popular with the general public. 
</P>
<P>
 A fully stocked camera bag can be heavy and space-consuming, a problem for 
those who like to travel light and spend a lot of time on foot. Several new 
products on the market can ease the burden for shutterbugs on the go. Herewith, 
innovations for the camera buff. Prices do not include shipping and handling, 
where applicable. 
</P>
<P>
 I consider both wide-angle and telephoto zooms essential for travel 
photography. A wide-angle lens of 28 millimeters or wider lets me get close to 
my subject and capture a swath of people amid their surroundings. A telephoto 
lens of at least 200 millimeters is necessary for shooting wildlife and 
bringing distant scenes closer. Until recently, the number and size of lenses 
you'd need to cover such a range made for heavy going indeed.  
</P>
<P>
 Now Tamron Industries, a longtime manufacturer of lenses, has devised an 
auto-focus (AF) 28-200-millimeter zoom lens that goes from wide-angle to 
telephoto with the flick of a wrist. Amazingly, this little lens measures just 
3.2 inches long and weighs only a smidgen more than 15 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent photo assignment in Indonesia, that was the only lens I used most 
of the time, which made my neck and shoulders ever so grateful. The lens does 
have some drawbacks. With a speed of f/3.8-5.6, this is a slow lens, not at its 
best in situations of low light or rapid movement -- though fast-speed film can 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, I found the images shot with the Tamron 28-200 less crisp than 
with my less versatile but razor-sharp Nikon lenses. Still, for the amateur 
photographer just looking for a wide range of fun shots, this lens is ideal, 
the resulting photos adequate. Currently the lens is available in models to fit 
Nikon, Minolta and Canon auto-focus cameras, or, with an adapter, about 20 
manual-focus models. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamron Industries' AF 28-200-millimeter zoom lens lists for $453, but is 
available for under $300 at discount camera stores.  
</P>

 My camera gets a lot of rough treatment. Whether stuffed into a carry-on bag 
or hanging from my neck strap, banging along through city walks and soggy rain 
forests, it's vulnerable to myriad dangers that could put it out of commission. 
But my leather camera cover takes up too much space in my bag when not attached 
to the camera, and when it's wet it takes forever to dry. I've found a solution 
in the padded neoprene camera covers made by Zing, a San Francisco company. 
</P>
<P>
 The lightweight, water-resistant covers stretch over any single lens reflex 
(SLR) camera and are available in three models: The Zing SLR Cover accommodates 
cameras with lenses up to 4 1/2 inches long; the Harness SLR Cover has an 
additional elastic waist harness that secures the bag and camera during 
vigorous activities, and the Zoom SLR Cover can handle lenses up to 7 inches 
long. A new addition is a Video Cover for small camcorders. I've found the 
covers good for absorbing the shock from minor bumps as well as shielding my 
camera from dust and light rainl; they squash into a tiny space in my carry-on 
bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Zing SLR Cover (5302) in red or blue, reversible to black, is $28.50; Zoom SLR 
Cover (5318) in the same colors is $36; Harness SLR Cover (5330)in black is 
$39.50. The Video Cover (5327)in black is $39. All are available from 
Travelsmith, a mail-order company, (800) 950-1600. For a store near you, 
contact the manufacturer at (800) 359-9119.

 Many photographers have a love-hate relationship with tripods. They're 
essential for steadying a camera during low-light exposures, especially with 
slow-speed lenses, but they tend to be a pain -- literally -- to schlep around. 
The Slik Corp.'s portable 450G aluminum minipod is a diminutive (12 inches when 
collapsed), 18-ounce lightweight product that's especially helpful for hikers 
and others who tote their equipment around on the hoof. Midway between a 
table-top tripod and a full-size model, the minipod's three telescoping legs 
and center column extend to 33 5/8 inches, appropriate for shooting from a 
ledge or -- if you kneel -- from the ground. Used with a camera's self-timer, 
it also can be set up so you can get into your own picture. The tripod's light 
weight makes it unstable for very long lenses, but it handled my full-size 
Nikon 8008 with 70-210-millimeter zoom, when the ground was firm and the 
swivel-tilt head well-tightened. The tripod comes with a long cord for slinging 
over the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Slik 450G Minipod (5311) is $39 from Travelsmith, (800) 950-1600, or at camera 
stores.

 If all of the above sounds oh-so-sophisticated, take heart. Even the junior 
set can get in on the camera craze with "My First Camera Book," complete with a 
simple reusable fixed-focus camera that uses a 110-film cartridge (not 
included). The book, which uses the Bialosky teddy-bear character as narrator, 
teaches kids how to load the film, frame a composition, keep the camera steady 
and take fun shots of friends, landscapes and even the family dog. The tiny red 
camera has a pop-up view-finder and a wrist strap. 
</P>
<P>
 "My First Camera Book" by Anne Kostick, with reusable camera (Workman 
Publishing; $9.95), is available at bookstores or from Book Passage, a 
mail-order company, at (800) 321-9785.

 Homestays abroad is a concept that has grown increasingly popular with those 
who enjoy the relaxed atmosphere of mingling and observing the lifestyles of 
their English-speaking hosts. These selected hosts provide family-style meals

BACKPACK & BUDGET; TRAVEL ASSISTANCE FROM GENEVA'S 'CAR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Each summer, in the lovely Swiss lakeside city of Geneva, a special 
information service geared to visitors on student-style budgets operates out of 
a big yellow bus in the center of town. It's known as "The Car," and you can 
find it at Rue du Mont-Blanc, just outside the shopping gallery under the main 
railway station. 
</P>
<P>
 The Car's staff helps visitors find budget accommodations and cheap 
restaurants, and offers advice on economical entertainment and budget 
transportation. It's open from July 1 to early September. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers can also pick up a free copy of Geneve Info Jeunes. It's a city map 
that includes information on accommodations, camping, restaurants, currency 
exchange, transportation, bike rentals, entertainment, beaches, museums and 
emergency services. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel in Switzerland can be challenging on a tight budget. But by using these 
sources, you can locate economical lodgings. For example, at Home St.-Pierre, 
which is at 4 cour St.-Pierre (in front of the cathedral in the old city), 
female travelers can find clean, cozy and comfortable shared-room 
accommodations for about $11 per night. 
</P>
<P>
 Geneva is home to more than 30 museums, the world's longest park bench (416 
feet), the world's tallest fountain (the 460-foot Jet d'Eau) and the largest 
July 4 Independence Day celebration outside of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Geneva is also the home for the United Nations (in Europe), and it's the 
birthplace of the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum offers moving exhibits 
ranging from World War I film footage to a room stacked with the 7 million 
index cards used to help locate and identify the 2 million prisoners of war 
detained in Europe during World War I. The regular entrance fee is $5.50, but 
students are charged only $3.50. The museum can be reached by taking bus No. 8 
from Cornavin Railway Station. 
</P>
<P>
 If you need a break from big cities, Jugi Tours, the travel service affiliated 
with the Swiss Youth Hostel Assn., operates programs geared to independent 
international travelers who want to explore the countryside with other 
like-minded adventurers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jugi Tours' guided hiking weeks are open to travelers between the ages of 16 
and 30. Groups are limited to 15 people. Three to seven hours are spent walking 
each day. Tour prices include seven nights' dormitory accommodations, breakfast 
and dinner, the services of a guide and local transportation. Participants 
return to the same lodgings every evening, so you don't have to worry about 
carrying your luggage. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, seven-night hiking weeks leave from the Swiss cities of Zermatt, 
Grindelwald and Maloja. From Zermatt, the programs begin July 7, July 23 and 
Sept. 1; the cost is $255. From Grindelwald, seven-night treks begin July 16, 
July 30 and Sept. 10; the price is $258. From Maloja, the programs begin July 
9, July 23 and Sept. 1; the cost is $244. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-night programs for hiking in the Jura region (the French part of 
Switzerland) are point-to-point programs, so hikers have to carry their 
luggage. The trips will begin July 23 and 30, and the cost is $258. 
</P>
<P>
 Jugi Tours also offers walking tours for travelers 16 to 30 (expect to be on 
the trails three to nine hours a day and stay in dormitories at youth hostels, 
mountain hotels and inns), plus mountaineering courses, cycling tours and 
"Swiss Safaris," which involve cycling, boating, biking, hiking, climbing 
(under supervision) and summer skiing. For more information, contact Jugi 
Tours, Engestrasse 9, 3012 Bern, Switzerland, telephone from the United States, 
011-41- 31-301-23-26, or fax 011-41- 31-301-66-71. 
</P>
<P>
 A map of Switzerland, Know-How '94, is available free from the Swiss Youth 
Hostel Assn. The map includes a list of the 80 hostels in the country and their 
facilities. Copies can be picked up at youth hostels in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on Switzerland, contact the Swiss National Tourist 
Office, 222 N. Sepulveda Blvd., Suite 1570, El Segundo 90245, (310) 335-5980.

 How can you, in good conscience, print a letter quoting "Prof. Higgins" as an 
authority on relations between the sexes? (Feb. 13). Using this example, I 
suppose that if someone complained of a racist remark, a letter from the Klan 
would have to be printed to offer the "opposing view"? And yes, my lady denotes 
ownership, as my lady companion or my lady friend would not. Come on, it's 
simple English!

DON'T MISS MIDDLE EAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding the Feb. 13 issue on travel in the Middle East: 
</P>
<P>
 I am a mature woman who has traveled to Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Egypt and 
Israel during the last 10 years.English is my only language and I am somewhat 
shy, but usually travel alone or with another woman. Public transportation, 
inexpensive lodgings and a flexible agenda are typical of my trips. 
</P>
<P>
 I found Middle Eastern people friendly and helpful well beyond my 
expectations. I was respected and well cared for. I recommend travel in that 
part of the world -- it is neither daunting nor unsafe.

SOME SPEED LIMITS TO RISE; ORANGE WANTS TO PRECLUDE CHALLENGES TO 'SPEED-TRAP' 
TICKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Higher speed limit signs will soon be posted all over this city as officials 
respond to a court ruling they fear could have their streets declared one big 
speed trap. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the recent ruling, other cities in Orange County may have to 
revise their speed limits as well, to comply with state speed-trap laws that 
forbid cities to post speeds that are artificially low. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next six months, Orange will spend an estimated $50,000 on new signs 
and traffic studies to bump up speed limits on 75% of its roadways, limits 
which have been kept low for years, primarily because of community pressure. 
Without the overhaul, citations based on police use of radar guns could, if 
challenged, be tossed out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Vehicle Code requires that speed limits be set in a fair manner. For 
speed limits under 55 m.p.h. that means they must be based on a survey of how 
fast motorists actually drive on that road when there is free-flowing traffic. 
They cannot be based on whimsy or community pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana dismissed a pair of Santa Ana 
speeding tickets in January because the speed limits on both streets were set 
more than 10 m.p.h. too slow and were thus deemed speed traps. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means the speed-trap laws are alive and well," said attorney John R. 
Farris Jr., one of two attorneys who won the Santa Ana case. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision follows a definitive ruling on speed traps in a Ventura County 
case two years ago. But the recent appeals court appeals court actions marks 
one of the first tests in Orange county of the precedent-setting ruling. The 
Santa Ana decision sends a strong signal to Orange County municipalities that 
they must demonstrate that their speed limits are fair. Otherwise cities face 
having their radar enforcement undermined. 
</P>
<P>
 The case shook up the city of Orange. Without the decision, "we would not be 
changing as many speed limits in such a brief period," said Bernie Denis, head 
of Orange's traffic engineering department. "It would not be such a gross 
change."  
</P>
<P>
 An informal survey of Orange County shows that officials in all cities are 
unfamiliar with the court decision and its implications. Even in Santa Ana, 
where the case originated, City Atty. Edward J. Cooper said it's too soon yet 
to determine what impact the decision will have. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the ruling, the posted speed limit must fall within 5 m.p.h. of 
the speed driven by the "85th percentile" of drivers in an actual traffic 
survey of the street. An exception such as a high accident rate, can justify a 
5-m.p.h. reduction in the posted speed limit. The survey must be updated every 
five years. (The 85th percentile is determined by surveying 100 drivers and 
determining the speed of the 85th fastest.) 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling that moved the city of Orange to action stems from two speeding 
tickets issued in Santa Ana in 1991. The first was given to a motorist driving 
50 m.p.h. in a 35-m.p.h. zone on West 17th Street between Bristol Street and 
the Santa River, according to court records. The other driver received a 
speeding ticket for going 45 m.p.h. in a 25-m.p.h. zone on Greenville Street 
between West 1st Street and St. Gertrude Place. 
</P>
<P>
 In both instances, said the appeals court, the citations were invalid. In the 
first case on West 17th Street, the 85th-percentile speed was 45.3 m.p.h., 
while in the second instance on Greenville Street, the 85th-percentile speed 
was 42.1 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the ruling stands, Santa Ana traffic officials insist that the court 
made a mistake, because the prosecutor used an old traffic survey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel both of these tickets are probably good," said Ruth Smith of the Santa 
Ana Traffic Engineering Department. "We've gone to a lot of trouble to make 
sure everything is legal." 
</P>
<P>
 The traffic engineers said their current 1991 survey of West 17th Street would 
justify a 40-m.p.h. speed limit and another 5-m.p.h. reduction because of a 
high accident rate. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second case, the 25-m.p.h. zone was warranted because of a nearby 
public school, say traffic officials. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Alex Mendoza is pleased with the court's action. Mendoza said he 
decided to fight the speeding ticket he received on 17th Street nearly three 
years ago because he was going no faster than anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court's decision makes me feel good," said the 33-year-old Laguna Nigel 
resident. "Because now tickets will be given out fairly." 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza's court victory affected Orange officials, who announced at a City 
Council meeting last month that recent traffic surveys require the raising of 
speed limits between 5 and 10 m.p.h. in more than 150 of its 200 speed zones 
because of new traffic surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 The news upset some residents who fear that the higher limits will encourage 
even faster driving on their neighborhood streets. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it's precisely this kind of community response that contributed to 
Orange's artificially low speed limits in the first place, say city officials. 
People want low speed limits in their neighborhoods, but higher limits 
everywhere else, said Councilwoman Joanne Coontz. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of public pressure, politicians have been known to keep speed limits 
too low," said Gary Foxen with the Auto Club of Southern California, which 
lobbies for realistic speed limits in neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is, however, that posted speed limits don't succeed in slowing down 
traffic, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a large body of research that says signs have very little do with 
how fast people drive on a street," said Keith Gilbert, also with the Auto 
Club. "To set it high or low won't affect the speed of traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 The 85th percentile standard is based on research and experience that 
demonstrate that a majority of motorists will travel at a "safe and prudent" 
sped. And when cities violate this principle it makes "a large percentile of 
your conscientious motorists lawbreakers," Dennis added. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem with what are considered illegally low speed limits is that 
the resulting fines are too high. If a motorist is cited for driving 45 m.p.h. 
in a 30-m.p.h. zone, the fine is about $80. But, if the 85th percentile speed 
is really 40 m.p.h., the fine should be about $28, for going 5 m.p.h. too fast. 
</P>
<P>
 As the new speed limits are posted in Orange, officials are warning that they 
will be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, motorists may have been used to getting a 10- to 15-m.p.h. 
cushion," Lt. Ed Tunstall said. "But when the new signs go up and the streets 
says 45 m.p.h., we mean m.p.h.

COLORS OF THE WORLD

<BYLINE>

By Colman Andrews

<TEXT>
<P>
 Colorful. Now there's an overworked adjective, especially in the 
travel-writing game. The festival is colorful, the old quarter is colorful, the 
populace itself is colorful, the surrounding hills and meadows are just one big 
blaze of color. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Still, sometimes it's hard to know what else to say.Some places are just more 
brilliantly or more beautifully painted than others -- and the paint often 
proves unexpectedly indelible. Long after dimmer memories have stopped echoing 
through our synapses, we're likely to recall the hue and dye of here or there. 
Color, simply put, is more immediately sensual than shape. It burns straight 
into the brain, not bothering with the mental algebra and geometry we need to 
make sense of, say, the form of things. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailing past a forest on a Russian riverbank, our mind records the deep green 
and golden chiaroscuro of the sun-dappled trees, not the height of the trunks 
or the vein patterns on the leaves. Back from a voluptuous tropical Mexican 
seaport, we may not recall the stylistic period or the architect's name, but we 
can still feel the radiating colors of the buildings -- cobalt blue, hot pink, 
lurid purple, a green that could have been invented by Matisse. Even a city 
best known for sound and flavor imprints a gaudy souvenir of motley visual 
images (costumes, foodstuffs, faces) on the traveler's mind. Color isn't just 
immediate, it's fast. Colman Andrews

TAX ON BATTERIES WOULD SNARL ELECTRIC CAR PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read with interest Robert A. Rosenblatt's Feb. 2 article ("New Juice for 
Electric Cars") regarding the vote by eastern states to endorse in principal 
the stringent California-style vehicle-emissions rules that are supported by 
environmentalists nationwide. The irony is that these same environmentalists 
are supporting a tax on lead-acid batteries -- the very energy source that will 
power no-emission electric vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Lead-acid batteries are increasingly viewed as the most viable power source 
for electric vehicles because they are the most readily available, safe and 
reliable battery technology. The bill, which calls for a 45-cents-per-pound tax 
on lead, would increase the cost of batteries for electric vehicles 
significantly. If passed, the tax will price electric vehicle technology out of 
the range of virtually all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally ironic is the fact that recycling remains the environmental 
community's battle cry, yet lead-acid batteries are the most recycled commodity 
in the United States, at more than 90% annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Tough rules are only one key element in improving our environment. Feasibility 
and fairness should be two others.

POLITICS; 8 WILL VIE FOR COUNCIL SEATS IN BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. JEANETTE AVENT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Beverly Hills Mayor Maxwell Salter declining to seek another term, it is 
virtually certain that the City Council will have at least one new face after 
the April election. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-person race for two seats includes only one incumbent, Robert K. 
Tanenbaum, who is seeking a third four-year term.  
</P>
<P>
 Salter declined to seek a third term, citing his belief that council members 
should be limited to two terms. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the candidates will meet for what is considered the most 
influential in a series of forums before the April 12 election. The League of 
Women Voters of Beverly Hills will host the candidates Thursday at 7 p.m. at 
Beverly Hills High School. The Southwest Beverly Hills Homeowners Assn. will 
host a forum next week. Both will be broadcast on Century Cable's Channel 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanenbaum, first elected in 1986, is noted both for his courtroom-style 
oratory and his frequent sparring with council members. During his eight years 
in office, he has also been instrumental in developing public-safety programs, 
and frequently champions the interests of residential neighborhoods. A resident 
for 15 years, he was the lone council member to vote against the Industrial 
Area Plan, the city's guide for new business development near the civic center, 
which he asserted would increase traffic on residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
 MeraLee Goldman, a former planning commissioner, and Les Bronte, a former 
Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce president, are widely seen as the strongest 
challengers in the race because of their high name recognition. This is the 
first council campaign for both. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman, a resident for 24 years, served two terms on the city's powerful 
Planning Commission. Bronte, a resident for 35 years, points to his 
participation in many sectors of the community, including the city's Traffic 
and Parking Commission and Caring for the Homeless Task Force as well as the 
Maple Center board and the 1993 School Bonds Steering Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Councilman Bernard J. (Bernie) Hecht, who developed a CPR training 
program for the city, is seeking to return to office after his narrow defeat to 
Councilman Thomas S. Levyn in 1992. Hecht, the retired owner of a trucking and 
warehouse business, has lived in Beverly Hills for 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates Mary Levin Cutler, Dr. Trisha Roth and Herm Shultz also have made 
previous but unsuccessful runs for the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler, a 37-year resident, is vice president of the Beverly Hills Municipal 
League civic group. She frequently speaks to the council about overdevelopment 
and the increasing number of oversize mansions on city hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth, an 11-year resident, also has addressed the council on a regular basis 
about her public health agenda, which includes smoke-free workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Shultz, a resident for 25 years, is president of Concern for Tenants Rights of 
Beverly Hills, an advocacy group for the city's apartment dwellers. The retired 
furniture store owner has served on the city's Affordable Housing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Robert Block, a 12-year resident, is a newcomer to City Hall affairs. The 
attorney has not served on city commissions, but points to his involvement in 
Beverly Hills schools among his qualifications for council. 
</P>
<P>
 Block, an attorney, drew attention in 1992 when he tried to intervene on 
behalf of two community groups in a court case that had been decided against 
the city. A developer had won a Superior Court decision allowing him to lease 
his Wilshire Boulevard building for medical offices. Block, who was 
representing Horace Mann Elementary School PTA and the 90211 Homeowner's Assn. 
on a volunteer basis, filed an unsuccessful appeal, arguing that the groups had 
not been notified of the suit despite their proximity to the building, and they 
had not had an opportunity to present their arguments about the traffic impact 
of a medical use. 
</P>
<P>
 No single issue is expected to galvanize voters. But candidates have spoken 
out against rising crime, traffic and the need to support the city's public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 At the forums, candidates are expected to hammer on the 15.4% increase in 
crime from 1992 to 1993. The city, which has 32,000 residents, recorded 2,825 
crimes last year -- 377 more than in 1992. Theft of valuables from vehicles 
registered the biggest jump among crime categories, with a rise from 574 to 849 
offenses reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The 130-member police force is the subject of an independent management audit 
authorized by the city last year to analyze the deployment of personnel and 
equipment. The department is one of several in the city undergoing a review to 
improve efficiency and save money. 
</P>
<P>
 Also high on the list of concerns for residents and candidates is the issue of 
preserving the quality of residential life. The impact of traffic and 
development on neighborhoods has been the focus of countless council meetings 
over the last two years, with residents demanding that the city combat commuter 
traffic through neighborhoods. The Candidates

K&B TOPS SOUTHLAND RESIDENTIAL BUILDERS; HOME BUILDING: FOCUSING LARGELY ON 
FIRST-TIME BUYERS, LEADING L.A.-BASED DEVELOPER REPORTS SALES VOLUME INCREASE

 Building more houses than its next two closest competitors combined, Kaufman & 
Broad Home Corp. has claimed the No. 1 spot on The Times' 23rd annual survey of 
Southern California home builders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based developer built 2,642 houses and condos in 1993 and sold 
all but 348 of them, for a sales volume of $434 million, up an astounding 55% 
from its 1992 sales volume of $279 million. 
</P>
<P>
 K&B builds primarily entry-level homes, in a price range of $100,000 to 
$200,000. The first-time buyer segment of the market has been treated much more 
gently by the four-year housing recession than the move-up market. 
</P>
<P>
 "The entry-level market has and will continue to be the engine that drives the 
market," said Bruce Karatz, the chairman and chief executive officer of K&B, 
"as lower prices and interest rates have made home ownership a reality for a 
broader range of buyers." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, K&B expects its sales to increase 18% to $512 million. "For 
well-capitalized builders with the right product for today's buyers, 1994 
should be an excellent year," Karatz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman & Broad moved up from the No. 2 ranking in the 1992 survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The William Lyon Co. of Newport Beach, which had topped the builders' survey 
for six consecutive years, did not participate in this year's survey. The Lyon 
Co. has been trying to work its way out of financial troubles that date back to 
slow homes sales in 1990 that made it difficult to meet the carrying costs of a 
huge inventory of land. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times mailed nearly 300 surveys to builders in Los Angeles, Orange, 
Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, Ventura and Kern counties. 
A total of 89 builders responded to the voluntary survey, down from 100 
respondents in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 2 builder was the Fieldstone Group of Companies, based in Newport 
Beach, which built 1,084 houses and condos and reported 1993 sales volume of 
$254.4 million, down 15.6% from '92 sales. The company had 49 unsold houses at 
year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fieldstone chief executive Keith A. Johnson is forecasting that the company 
will do $236 million in sales this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Fieldstone' predicted decline, Johnson said, "the upturn for 
first-time buyers is under way, and will increase in higher price ranges as the 
year improves." Fieldstone is a move-up developer, building most of its homes 
in the $200,000 to $350,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
 Fieldstone's 1992 sales results were omitted from last year's survey, but the 
company would have ranked second. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 3 builder is Los Angeles-based Pardee Construction Co., which moved up 
from No. 8 in the 1992 survey. The company reported 1993 sales volume of $226.5 
million, up a whopping 44% from its 1992 results. The company, which built 
1,402 houses, condos and apartments last year and sold all but 131 of them, is 
predicting a 26% increase in business this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the No. 4 spot is Upland-based Lewis Homes of California, which built 1,031 
single-family homes and condos and reported 1993 sales volume of $221.6 
million, a decline of 4% from '92 results. The company had 111 unsold homes at 
year-end. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is predicting its sales revenue will grow to $250 million this 
year. "Increases in interest rates and the pickup in the national economy will 
motivate many shrewd buyers to purchase now, while the window of opportunity is 
open," said Randall W. Lewis, executive vice president of the family-owned 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 5 builder is the Presley Companies of Newport Beach, which built 1,178 
houses and condos and reported 1993 sales volume of $213.9 million, up 20% from 
1992. Presley had 80 homes in year-end inventory. The company is predicting a 
slight drop in business in 1994 to $204 million. BUILDING LEADERS

FIREFIGHTER EXAM

<TEXT>
<P>
 * This letter is in response to the article "5,000 White Males Barred from 
Taking L.A. Firefighters Exam," Feb. 26. I am not white. I am not a 
firefighter. I am not even a labor union sympathizer. I am a Mexican American, 
and after reading your news article I am outraged to say the least! 
</P>
<P>
 What in the world is happening to our elected officials? Where does it say 
that minorities make better firefighters than whites? Whatever happened to 
equal opportunity for all? Whatever happened to obtaining a position based on 
individual merit? If my house ever caught fire, I wouldn't care what the 
firefighters looked like or how they spoke! All I would ask for is that they be 
competent in putting the fire out quickly! 
</P>
<P>
 I am sick and tired of seeing our elected officials at the local and state 
level always use the same lame excuse that their hands are tied. This time they 
are saying that they are mandated by a 1974 agreement with the U.S. Department 
of Justice, to rationalize their action. Baloney!

 * In the article the statement, "He wants to become a firefighter so badly but 
he can't. He's the wrong race," is quoted. How many times have those very words 
been expressed by a minority mother?

 * Being an Anglo woman, I shudder to think what could happen if the Fire 
Department's hiring policy also pertained to putting out fires and saving 
people's lives.

 * I am appalled that Los Angeles is barring white males from its firefighter 
examination. We need our firefighters to be the best qualified individuals 
available. A firefighter today needs to be able to understand the treatment of 
hazardous materials. They need to be able to do the complex hydrodynamic 
calculations to determine how many, and what sizes of hose lines can be 
supported. And of course, a firefighter still needs the strength to carry a 
victim (possibly another firefighter) out of a hazardous area. 
</P>
<P>
 I, for one, don't care whether a firefighter is male, female, black, yellow, 
brown, green, or even white. That doesn't matter. What matters is having the 
best qualified individuals available in times of emergency. Barring 5,000 
individuals from taking the examination is ensuring that our new firefighters 
will not be the most qualified individuals as our firefighters. This is neither 
equal opportunity nor fair to the public.

SIDE TRIPS; THE WHITE HOTEL

 Jaipur is capital of the desert state of Rajasthan in northwestern India and 
one of that nation's most colorful cities. Inside the Old City's 270-year-old 
walls, the buildings are pink and orange -- in fact, Jaipur is called "the Pink 
City" -- and the streets are filled with donkeys, horses, cows, goats, monkeys 
and even elephants.On the other hand, the city's most beautiful building, the 
Rambagh Palace, is luminously white and the rooms are filled with fortunate 
souls paying as much as $500 a day to live like nabobs. Built by the maharajah 
Man Singh II in the late 1920s, the Rambagh was turned into a luxury hotel in 
1957. The luxury is real. Guests can stroll through the gardens in the cool of 
sunrise, sip Singapore slings on the terrace as musicians and jugglers perform 
and camel-drivers pass by, work out in the well-equipped gym, swim in the 
indoor pool with its stained-glass windows, sample excellent Indian and 
European food in the main dining room (called the Suvarna Mahal, or Golden 
Palace, for its gilded mirrors and thick golden brocade tapestries). My own 
$150-a-night suite was about 600 feet square -- so large it came with dual-zone 
air-conditioning -- and had a marble bathroom about three times the size of the 
average Indian house. More expensive suites are practically palaces of their 
own.

 Rambagh Palace, Bhawani Singh Road, Jaipur, telephone (91-141) 521-241; 
reservations, (800) 448-8355. Rates: $125 to $500 per night for two. Barry
